Perfectly said.

---
---
Wow's landscape in the next 3-10 years isn't bound by the promises they make during a rerolled product beta launch.
---

---
They'll do whatever makes the most amount of profit. Key word, profit. Not revenue. 
---
Game development is an insanely expensive endeavor, and from somebody who works for a software company if they have a golden goose they can continue to milk with minimal effort... they will.
---
That means minor enhancements to facilitate replay-ability of already created content.
---
Hyjal was the most mind blowing one because I saw it before BWL even came out.  We actually got to do a training exercise in a very under construction Hyjal.  Way later we started seeing more tickets on players would start figuring out how to sneak in.
---
This is going to be a big point of division for the classic community. I already see three camps popping up and we can't have all three. Heck, we can probably only sustain 1 of the ideas without fracturing the community. 
---
Camp 1, NoChanges. Don't need to say much more. They want classic without changes forever. Every few years drop a new server to keep it fresh. Merge old ones as the population dies. Etc. No BC, no new content.
---
Camp 2, Progression Servers. After classic the server goes to BC, WoTLK, etc. Debate is on char copy or sorry charlie your character moves with the server.
---
Camp 3, Finish Vanilla. The most interesting camp is the one that wants to see 1.13 turn into 1.14 and beyond. Finish the content that was planned for vanilla in classic. Maybe add more once that is done.
---
I don't think we are going to get all three camps. That is too much fracturing of the community. As-is we aren't getting RPPVP servers. I think the first camp (NoChanges) is going to be out of luck. They can't keep milking classic forever. At best every 3-5 years they might launch a new classic server. Without new content servers are bound to die out eventually. It may take 10 years, but it is going to happen. 
---
The second camp has a real chance and is the most likely. If classic is popular enough, it would be a lot of income for relatively little development cost. Just have to make sure to not splinter the community.
---
Third camp is my personal camp. I also think it is not likely, at all. This would take classic being a huge hit to do. This camp has the highest development cost so there would have to be some kind of incentive to go down this road. Probably cosmetic items or wow tokens or an added subscription cost.
---
Blizzard not expanding the game in one way or another is just screaming out for low revenue and a huge loss in playerbase, look at OSRS, they recently added new raids and stuff a few months ago along with mobile and its at a record high while maintaining the exact same feeling the oldschool version of the game had. I just hate this mentality of this purist classic wow fanbase, they just want to kill every game they play. I'd be absolutely furious if I worked all the way up to Naxxramas and got full Nax gear just to go afk on my toon for 2 years with no new content and nothing to do. It would basically be the same exact thing as a private server, a useless toon on a useless server with no updates. New content must be added, whether it will be unique bonus raiding and pvp content, or expanding to other expansions like TBC.
---
Bwl was just coming out when I started. Barely anyone was playing 40-60. Had to get carried in 5mans. It was so slow.
---
At least this map without New Zealand has a dragon instead. r/MapsWithoutNZ
---
Resto druids can farm lashers very easily.
---
It still happens on retail\~
---
no ive gotten betas from blizzard without sub.
---
Haha yeah, impersonating blizzard wasn't taken lightly.  They were pretty cut and dry though, we had a real clean cut policy for it so if it happened there wasn't much a player could say that could defend it.
---
Yes, all I want is a non bg server. Never release bg's and never implement DHK's. I want a server that has no illusions about understanding the good and bad that comes with world pvp.
---
Just think about the kind of feedback they would get from people who play BFA
---
I honestly have no idea, but I have every single xpac purchased, I have BFA, tons of wow tokens purchased, many subscriptions, many blizzard purchases, and also currently active on BFA, I have also given them feedback on the BFA PTR before it was released. So my chances are likely, but the thing is the beta could be an open beta for everyone. Unless it closed beta, then you will need to be lucky to get access.
---
No.. Most people who subbed since release never received a beta invite... These days you most likely has to be famous on social media aka Twitch, YouTube
---
I'LL RIP THE SECRETS FROM YOUR FLESH.
---
The overwhelming majority of GMs never even dressed their characters.  For those who did show off, I think it was all part of the presentation.  It makes it more fun for the player ;)
---
What was the most frustrating, yet common issue to help people resolve as a GM?
---
I was originally thinking I wouldn't play just because I want whatever I do in Classic to stick around. But if I got selected, I would go play around on a couple of characters to try to narrow down an alt.
---
Listen... bio breaks of all kinds are valid.
---
I’ve never played vanilla so I’m remaining pure so launch can take my virginity
---
You are incredibly naive if you believe this.
---
Fury warriors weren't a meme until 1.8
---
I want to launch my Twitch stream with Classic so I hope I get a beta. It'll give me a head start. I don't think I will though because I'm on a tiny laptop best suited to net browsing. I'd have to build my new computer and log into Battlenet to update my computer specifications to stand a chance. I think that's how it works anyway.
---
oh boy, a beta of a 15 year old game
---
the #NoChanges movement is fucking retarded and everyone involved should be put to death.
---
Themepark MMOs survive because there is a constant stream of content. Unless they pull the smart move and make content 1.13 and beyond like OSRS, you're going to have empty servers a year into release. Nobody is going to want to replay the same stale content forever. You could make the argument like a shit-eating TipsOut fanboy "b-b-b-b-b-but private servers have healthy populations!!!". That's because the majority of the people who play on private servers are too poor and stupid to get a job to play an actual good subscription MMO like FFXIV. They definitely won't be shelling out the 15 bucks a month.
---
Blizzard needs to think hard about this and ignore the retarded vocal minority screaming for essential a carbon copy of private servers which are already widely available.
---
edit: Looks like the ShitsOut fanboys are out in full force tonight downvoting and censoring the truth. Enjoy your empty servers.
---
Holy paladin is the only option.
---
Heal bots ftw.
---
&gt;Am I going to cherry pick responses out for you?
---
If you’re legitimately trying to point to that thread as a source of “good” responses, then yes. I’m not seeing good ones. 
---
&gt;Hopefully you see that there is a passionate community willing to fill at least 1 server, even if it's not for you.
---
Less than 500 unique responses and a poll showing that even amongst the most rabid fans only 8% of the pop would roll there, doesn’t prove that. Especially when you realize that a lot of comments in that thread (and this is true for the OP himself) state that RP-PvP wasn’t the persons primary server type at any point. 
---
As is here’s the archived policy that explains in detail how they differed. I dug it up after following a link in one of the replies.
---
http://web.archive.org/web/20060414223949/http://wow-europe.com/en/policy/roleplaying.html
---
Literally nothing on there, minus names, was ever enforced. If that’s the case, then why further split populace. 
---
With Blizzards GM staffing they don’t have resources to police anything mentioned in that policy. Nor do they want to. They absolutely don’t want to sanction people for “Non-Story Line dialogue in general chat” in 2019, because they didn’t even work hard at it back then.
---
So. Yeah I guess having been on one, with my current view of the facts, no, there’s not much you can say. I’m willing to listen, but I’ll admit it’s not really a trivial matter to change my opinion.
---
So like patch 1.13 doesnt really mean anything? Is it actually patch 8.x in disguise?
---
The only way is nowai
---
Probably not
---
I was in the cata beta without an active subscription.
---
But, who knows
---
The only way I'll believe you is if you answer this question: 
---
What happens when The Unstoppable Force meets The Immovable Object?
---
I would love if they did these kind of things in classic+, after naxx, but I doubt they would do it in 1.13 before naxx.
---
yeah why not aslong as they add a gbank, so we dont have to account share ill be super happy. haha
---
more does not = good, necessarily
---
I raided on Maelstrom rppvp during vanilla. We opened the AQ gates and killed cthun, raided naxx, did all of that. Good times. I would roll on one again, otherwise I'll go rppve.
---
He talked about how the build is unencrypted, is this more likely to be a completely open beta then??
---
Reading the first paragraph and then reading the second, made me read the quotations in Akihiko Kayaba's American-voiceactor's voice (the GM's voice in the dubbed Sword Art Online) lol.
---
And doing classic+ with designs that are already there, storylines and things that were planned isn't easiest?   
---
  The golden goose being milked WOULD BE classic and classic+.  
---
  It's simply not sustainable to release tbc and while you might gain a decent increase at launch, you end up killing everything that got you there in the first place.  
---
  Again, classic development apparently started about a year or so after OSRS started seeing massive success, it's no coincidence and people need to stop ignoring all these things just because they want tbc, an expansion that never showed the interest vanilla players showed.
---
I wish I could say, but honestly I don't know to much about Warden.  It operated on a level that a normal GM never had to deal with.
---
On a very basic level of explanation the cheating systems were trying to detect patterns that weren't supposed to happen in the game.  So for example there was a minimum speed you could run at in the game with all buffs and mounts and everything.  If you run above that level something isn't right.  Obviously it's way more advanced than that, but on a very base level it's trying to find impossible movements.
---
lava run and emp runs are different runs though.
---
I'm thinking closed to keep everybody hungry.
---
Idk but they should LET ME IIIIIIN!
---
But my family is not!
---
I am sooooooooo ready i physically need this
---
Yeah 250 gold in classic was, if I remember correctly, worth more then the $15 buck sub price when being sold by gold farm banks.
---
Grad school shad school.
---
You now go to the school of Azeroth!
---
Yeah - I can definitely see where you are coming from.  I think your points are valid in the context you've stated and I'm sure that, unfortunately, this may happen.  On the other hand, I think just based on the nature of the game...the leveling commitment alone is going to keep a bunch of the jack ass 14 year old "fucked your mom" types out of the way.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm honestly most worried about streamers running around with an army of followers causing massive disruption.
---
It does, you regen mana outside of the 5 sec rule.
---
Alright, don't get all religious now and believing in fate.
---
I believe at some point they moved it further out. Using a sandbox server its easy to verify that GM island is way too far out in 1.12 to be reached with slow fall.
---
Any memorable experiences in particular? Best/Worst?
---
Same, tbc was such a massive philosophy change it's almost not the same game.
---
Glad you are enjoying it!  Really excited about classic so it's fun to share some of these stories in anticipation!
---
I think it would be the opposite of this, it's in stock, it's just in the back.
---
Forgive me if this has been asked  (haven't got time to read all the Q and A's but did you work from home or in a "call centre" of sorts, as i always imagined GM's working from home.
---
Bro... if anybody loses to a warrior in world PvP they fucked up.  Warrior is literally the worst solo world PvP class in the game.
---
He has said earlier that messing with your or other peoples accounts when its not strictly work related was grounds for termination.

This is a really great question. OP hasn't officially said this is over, so I hope this gets answered.
---
This infatuation over streamers has me confused as hell.
---
Playing a game with a community is great. But the complete obsession over who you're following, chasing then around, watching them as you fall asleep, while you shit, while you jerk off. It's bizarre.
---
I imagine any intelligent Raid lead would have shamans focused on either Grace or WF not both to make it more mana efficient.
---
$15/hr in 2005 is equivalent to $19.52/hr in 2019. Not too bad! Especially with benefits.
---
TIME BOIS
---
Awesome but I ain't touchin it!
---
Hunter pull won’t put you in combat. As long as you don’t dps or heal an ally in combat you can still shadowmeld.
---
Or a Friends and Family Alpha. Unencrypted just means it's not purely internal, like a Dev working from home.
---
Yeah, anything involving any sort of interruption of game play required clearance from a higher up.  We definitely relied on each other to cover the vast knowledge needed to help the players, it's such a large game and new things keep popping up, everyone's collective knowledge really helped solve problems.
---
Damn, I didn't realize it was fixed.
---
Would you say the Devilsaur Mafia "ruins the integrity of the game"?
---
It's a modified client that runs in line with 8.x.  The same exploit and security patches will be added to both etc.
---
Ita definitely not based off 1.12 with changes.
---
it's a gimmick item, elemental shaman might right click a mage or maybe a melee once in a blue moon. Its maybe a good weapon for paladins who aoe farm or maaybe tank
---
Only thing I can say now is that I hope time proves you wrong and we are all playing on the server we want in a few months. I'd be content if it was just a medium pop realm.
---
You could swim to gm island with a lvl 1 wearing high spirit gear and enchants, you out regen the fatigue.
---
I think I'm going to shoot for a West Coast US server if possible. I've seen some guilds advertise they'd raid at 7 pm West Coast time, which is 9 PM my time. That would be near perfect for me.  This gives me about 1-1/2 hours after my kids go to sleep to spend time with my wife before a raid starts.
---
Hi everyone.
---
Why do you recommend an RP server? I’ve never played one.
---
Sort of.
---
It will use a modern API but modified for the differences in Classic. Some capabilities may be completely disabled and new methods added, but where they can be the same they will.
---
i joined Horde because the people who got me to play were already on Horde! horde/pvp server :)
---
i do love the Horde so much. the orc's sympathetic story was so wonderful. the fact that current game really has them playing the role of the Bad Guy constantly feels so cheap.
---
itshappening.gif
---
I honestly wouldn’t mind if history proves me wrong.
---
But based on the factual history of how the game has gone, it won’t. 
---
Guess we’ll see.
---
Being in Goldshire at night when night actually made the zones dark af, I'll never forget being on my level 12 dwarf Hunter questing there. The feels.
---
What is i like stealth, healing and melee combat.
---
I also dont like druid.
---
You threw out assumptions and called it truth. Bad move, bud!
---
Yeah seriously tons of irrelevant posts because someone "has a feeling" something will happen. kinda waters down the subreddit and real news or findings
---
No hunter melee cause you ran out of arrows? Not noob enough for me!
---
For the most part we were grinding away behind a chat box.  Those in game moments were actually pretty rare from my stand point.  Having a ticket go really well and making a player really happy was great though, I think most GMs really enjoyed feeling the love from the players.
---
I don't have much knowledge of any of the current inner workings though, anything that happened after the BC days I am in the dark about. ;)
---
I would actually love it if they expanded vanilla beyond its shitty Naxx state
---
ITZ YA BOI!!!!!
---
All the more reason to. I wish I didn't remember anything of it. First time watching was epic.
---
https://youtu.be/FNkpIDBtC2c?t=25
---
Mage I would guess, the problem I see with flat out nerfing DM is that you just shift the "must-have-alt" from hunter to mage, more so with this example, aoe farming in the world should be very possible if its retail-vanilla pop caps
---
Too soon.
---
Gank that blood elf escort NPC outside ratchet maybe..
---
The Orc Wariestaman...duh
---
There was always going to be a beta. Not announced, but literally every product has a beta.
---
"Well Blizzard upload a file called WoW\_Classic\_Beta, now what does this mean? Is blizzard hinting at something? Well lets break down the word. WOW. We know that, that means World of Warcraft". Ok now, Classic----"
---
Ya, not the best farmers. I hear holy nova priest can farm DM east pretty well. Spirit tap helps quite a bit but sucks to have to build around a farm spec. Better off using professions and AH to get rich as a priest.
---
It won't happen, and as someone who wasn't playing the day it did happen, I don't think it should. Still a funny/cool event though.
---
https://youtu.be/_aHoJUxZsOI?t=2206
---
Will the launch experience be just as fun and special in summer if they launch an open beta just months before the official release? Hell no, an open beta will ruin several things and I don't think Blizzard wants old players coming back after 13 years or whatever to finally get to experience classic again on a beta.
---
They need to keep the hype and "mystery"(in lack of a better word) sky high in order to not waste the initial experience of the game. So yeah, closed beta if they are smart.
---
Just roll the dice dude and forget about it. No time to doubt. Get aboard the train before it leaves!
---
When I first started working there it was so small it's possible it happened early on and I wasn't even aware.  Like he probably had to walk through to get where he was going kinda thing.  I do have a cool Mike Morhaime story though.  For the 2nd Blizzcon his band the 'Level 60 Elite Tauren Chietans' opened the Blizzcon concert and I got to act as a defacto roady and carry his bass over to the stage.
---
Arrrgg, I meant gold farming.
---
I would bet there's no invites. Main thing about this beta will be gauging population. Probably going to be totally open, no sub required, over like 4 days.
---
Your username is ClassicWasShit, coming into the Classic Wow subreddit to try and spark arguments. I'm not biting the bait, troll.
---
haha yeah, verifying bots!
---
If people reported bots we would scope them out, many times I think the bots had a command to stop bot behavior if they received tells, so if we saw bot like behavior we would scope it out first.
---
Man I haven't played wow since streamers were a thing. Sounds awful.
---
An army of bots can't tell you how many servers to make though
---
If one doesn't get into beta, does that make one alpha? philosoraptor.png
---
Are you sure there will even be a beta for classic?
---
Sure!  Was a long time ago!
---
I started at $10, was moved up to $12 + benefits at full time and worked my way up to $15 eventually.  I thought it was amazing for an entry level job
---
Anyone know if classic will have pve servers or will they all be pvp?
---
I’d join if they have pve...  I just want to kill Murlocs in peace.
---
Mind PMing me some details? I really need to just mess around before classic release with my 3 character options to settle on one before day 1 lol
---
As someone else stated, in beta you’re not really playing the game. They essentially give you levels at every stage with varying sets of gear and have you try to exploit the game.
---
So, they’ll want a stress test on MC, so they’ll have testers run through MC.
---
Also, they’ll want to do stress tests on the server. So they’ll literally warp people into a designated area and see how many people fit before the server crashes.
---
Beta tests are fun for new games, but being that it’s a re-release I’m not going to go crazy over it.
---
Pretty safe bet it will be closed for the majority of time slowly adding more people and then with a stress test that's open or at least with a ton of people near the end.  
---
  
---
The start of the beta is really to catch bugs through feedback, and having 10,000 people filling reports and complaining about crashes isn't really any more useful than 100 people doing the same thing.  
---
Towards the end when it's stable and sorted you just want to add more people so you can find more rare bugs, and then finally with a ton of people to stress test things under high load.
---
big mad lol
---
This is part of why I used the Earthshaker for meme value in PvP. It’s what I imagine that giant log would do to someone.
---
Probably everyone. They need to gauge interest to determine how many servers to make. 
---
Stress testing etc... aren't really needed in this scenario since it's just 7.x with a facelift.
---
Some of us actually prefer TBC and Wrath ahead of Vanilla. You begging Blizzard to not release servers for these expansions makes you no different from the people begging for Vanilla servers not to be released.
---
Yeah hoarding actual upgrades is the big problem with dkp
---
This please :c
---
I joined Horde because it had the reputation of being less popular with young kids. Seemed true to me.
---
Haha yeah, GM Island is actually not that significant to the GMs.  We do tend to park our characters there, but most never really hung out there.  The issue with getting there was the exploitation of game mechanics, there wasn't supposed to be a way to get there.  How severe the punishment was likely had some component of how it was achieved.
---
#nochanges
---
I think your underestimating how many people see Classic as an amazing step towards a re-creation of the game they love most (whether thats TBC or WoTLK for some). Of course most of these people will enjoy classic too, but they might be anticipating Blizz to ultimately do the same for TBC and WoTLK. Who are you to say that Vanilla is the only version that people are excited for and deserve to have re-created?
---
This right here is why my guild is using Loot Council.  Nothing that improves raiding should go to waste, and people shouldn’t feel like they should let upgrades rot just to get what they want.
---
Pretty sure they're only having pvp-rp realms. If you don't rp properly they ip ban you from classic and force you to play Overwatch 6 hours a day for 2 weeks to unlock it.
---
So you'd prefer Classic to be full of bugs and not-vanilla-like things just so that it releases a few weeks earlier?
---
lol
---
My Body Ready: Is.
---
Check your game launcher available game downloads every 5 minutes for 4 weeks.
---
:)
---
All that hunter wisdom gear...
---
&gt;night elves
---
Meh, I'd say trolls. The only reason there are so many Troll enemies is because they are the oldest race by far on Azeroth. It was basically their world. The original Night Elves were trolls that stayed by the Well of Eternity for too long and got changed. They (Night Elves) were the first to call the Legion's attention to Azeroth. Not very chill.
---
This is weirdly similar to my reasons lol
---
Unfortunately I can't shed much light on monitoring World firsts, as I never did anything like that.
---
This was probably less of an exact science and likely involved the GM doing a fair amount of learning as well.  World first also means the GM hasn't seen it and the Devs don't know how live players will respond so there is sort of a ok lets learn aspects to that.  The GM may not be aware immediately what is a clear violation of game mechanics before they see everything play out.
---
I'm a purist, no change dogmatic. So I approve.
---
Dark Souls is hard even if you're careful.  Goddamn Capra Demon fight.
---
Also there's hundreds of people trying to "corner" the market.
---
They beat anyone in heal spec. They beat Rogues. They definitely beat hunters.
---
Bruh... your first tips with the FPs.... I’ve never heard of that before
---
I would love to see the unplanned/finished stuff finished, but I wonder
---
1) would that sort of turn classic into a alternate reality- alternate timeline thing?
---
2)  is there away to they could increase the level cap (perhaps with adding emerald dream for example).?  If im not mistaken, when BC came out there was a stat squish or something, so that  lvl 61 gear &gt; level 60 gear  or something.
---
I just remember how intimidating Winterspring was. Felt like I was approaching the upper echelons of the game.
---
I'd play it for its purpose: to find and report as many bugs that I can find. Sure it wouldn't be as "magical" as the real release, but some people are going to need to make that sacrifice to get the game polished.
---
I can't recall anytime I was able to give a gift.  We could restore items you legitimately had, but in general we didn't really do things like that.
---
Earlier someone brought up an example of a GM made a repair bot for them, and something like this could happen, especially if they felt like it was a form of compensation for waiting, not a typical thing to do though.

I started as a NE warrior because all my friends in HS were NE rogues/hunters. Chose a warrior because I saw that they could use the most weapons. A year into vanilla I got kicked out my raiding guild cuz I was trying to rank up and didn’t wanna raid. There was no faction changes at the time so I had to xfer my NE warrior off my server. Luckily there was a free xfer since mine was high-pop at the time. I rerolled an UD warrior for wotf and cannibalize. Leveled to 60 and started to pvp. 
---
The top Horde pvp guild recognized me by my name and asked if I was the NE warrior who was rank 12 at the time. I said yes and they let me join their guild. I knew the ins and outs of my ally guilds raid schedule/meet up times so we used that to our advantage and made life hell for all their raids. They helped me hit rank 13 right before TBC launched and the pvp rewards were changed to honor points. 
---
Ahh 2004-2007 WoW brings back so many memories.

---
Yes they will have PvE.
---
What are you gonna main on horde this time?  I’m stuck between ally warrior or shaman atm.
---
You know what I want?  To be able to get all those cool variant mounts that are shown at the hitching posts outside of Gadget and Winterspring.  There are a bunch of mount models that you can't actually get.
---
Patterns.  
---
Like if you notice a bunch of guildless level 44 hunters are handing one character large sums of gold with no dialogue for no reason it's warrants a closer look.  Find who they are is the hard part.
---
For what reason  is there to do this?
---
I purposefully said " I get that sentiment" to make it clear I am not supporting not having a BETA. I was just explaining what his reasoning likely was.
---
so.... learn to read?
---
I’m probably gonna semi-rush to level 20, so I can be in the first wave of dungeon crawlers. It would be cool to get the server first van cleef kill, lol.
---
I wonder if the people who are 20 after 10 hours would even be the kind of people to run a dungeon though.
---
To be fair, we *did* get some major major news today, probably the biggest news yet, even if it isn’t via Blue Post. Not a release date, but something even more important, having a beta. I was resigned to no beta but I’m relieved.
---
They spent it on armbands with feathers
---
I resubed to wow just in case its a req for the beta and so when it actually gets announced Im past the payment servers being down.
---
Lots of buttplugs might work
---
Haha omg I never considered it, and I couldn't imagine they would ask.  Honestly I do think I would try and fit it into my schedule should the hypothetical situation arise, if even for a little bit.
---
I have nothing but amazing memories of my time there, but I am pretty darn excited just to play Classic again at all, I can't wait!
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
 I wanted to main a hybrid pally, but I just ant do Ally again. So ima horde shamman. A class I know NOTHING about.
---
This post should be linked to off the Wikipedia entry for rationalization.

**[A] Kiwi/Aus Semi-casual Raiding Guild (NA | PvE)**
---
In Vanilla WoW, many more people ran dungeons as they levelled. It was common to meet likeminded people and make friends as you journeyed through Azeroth. The world was huge, with lots to experience – and that experience was magnified for people who joined a guild whose members supported and helped each other.
---
This is a guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and give and receive help with classes and game mechanics.
---
**Are you a progression guild?**
---
This is intended to be a guild for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60, but there is an expectation to gear up and delve into raiding (and a bit of level 60 PvP).
---
**What are the requirements?**
---
The guild has a few rules:
---
•	Be open and willing to accept all different kinds of players, with different levels of experience, a different approach to how they play and different real-life commitments
---
•	Have a good attitude to the game in general and towards your guildmates, regardless of how they choose to play; be willing to help others where needed, albeit dungeon runs, supporting alts or helping people with group quests
---
•	Be willing, as you approach level 60, to work towards pre-raid gear
---
•	Be free for three hours, two nights a week for dedicated raiding progression
---
•	Be communicative: let the guild leader or other guild officers know if you need to take a break or can’t attend a raid or event.
---
This is about community and helping each other enjoy the game; but understanding that sometimes life itself prevents you from doing everything you may want to do.
---
**Is this guild only for Kiwis/Aussies?**
---
We will be raiding 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week – but anyone is welcome to join.
---
**Do I have to have played vanilla WoW?**
---
I suspect many people who are going to jump into Classic experienced vanilla WoW to some degree. There may be a few dabblers or people who started in TBC or Wrath; but I predict that the majority of those who stick around through to level 60 will be veterans coming into the remake with a nostalgic view.
---
This guild is a place of acceptance, where anyone with the right attitude and willingness to learn and improve can find a home. I’m looking for people with dedication, who are willing to level to 60 and enjoy playing with like-minded people as part of a supportive community.
---
**I didn’t see a name. What is the guild called?**
---
I have a few names in mind, but I’m going to put the guild name to a vote once the game goes live, for two reasons:
---
•	If I name the guild now, there’s no guarantee that the name will be available when we get the guild charter up (call me paranoid)
---
•	Collective, or at least majority agreement on the name, will give people more investment in the guild
---
I understand that some people may not want to commit until they know what the name of the guild is. 
---
We will have many weeks, if not months of levelling to 60, so I don’t expect a full 40-man raid of committed members when Classic goes live. But it sure would be nice!
---
I am also hoping that those who are happy with the choice of name when the time comes will be willing to pitch in and help pay for the guild charter. The more people who pitch in, the sooner we will be able to secure the name that we agree on – if enough people contribute to the 10g fee, we may even snag the name we want within a few days (or even hours) of release.
---
**How do I apply?**
---
We have a guild Discord server (https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3) where you can put in an application; or PM me on Discord: Lokhor#2882.
---
Peace.
---
No one knows this for certain, but you have not needed to be subbed for previous WoW betas so it is unlikely you'd need a sub for this one.
---
Wew. Yeah the streamers could be an issue. I'm kinda hoping that since it is an 'older' game with a lot of grind that the streamers will see themselves losing views and switch to more exciting games. That is the only reason I'm not worried yet but if the streamers stick around, I'm with you.
---
I mean, the swift zulian looks like a regular tiger, that's pretty close right?
---
HERE WE GO BOYS, TELL YOUR WIVES AND FAMILIES GOODBYE, for now
---
Did players' accounts have notes on them from previous GM interactions? Like "warning: asshole" or "was very pleasant" etc.
---
Na its a very long cd, doesn't do much damage and you dont get it til like 40s
---
Sounds like you have questions.
---
Must have been pretty cool playing on the same server as death and taxes.
---
DM being diremaul, not deadmines. Hunters can sneak past all the trash and solo the final boss through some clever mechanics, and earn huge amounts of gold very quickly, without much required investment.
---
Same car, suped up engine.
---
Every class except the one you're currently playing is OP
---
they are stupid if they dont let some people do some high level testing to find exploits , there will very very likley be a character wipe so only like 0.5% of players will get to 60 to do actual testing
---
I have already played 1-60 on retail vanilla and private servers. I will be playing the beta. I plan on using it for what betas should be used for. Bug testing/feature testing. Depends on what the beta entails and how long its around, but I will certainly test as much as possible for blizzard. I want this game perfect.
---
On retail battlegroups are mostly deprecated and you can be matched with anyone from your region except for arenas.
---
Was it called The Nicker all throughout vanilla? I can't remember when they changed it.
---
...only after someone asks why you're melee'ing the boss (because your bow is broken)
---
I've spent an unhealthy amount of money on xfers, race/faction changes etc and I've gotten into every single beta except for diablo 3.
---
Almost known as a remote code execution exploit.
---
It was actually confirmed March 11th they plan on doing a hybrid of progressive itemization.
---
If modders get into beta are we likely to have launch day mods?
---
Hi, /u/Crono908
---
I don't know personally, but if it was a rogue GM doing that they most certainly lost their job.  From the first day of training on they really instill that it's our job to maintain the integrity of the game, so it's pretty much the biggest offense what they did.
---
Were you allowed to duel if somebody challenged you?
---
I probably won’t play Beta, I would rather leave the opportunity to someone who would get more value out of it.
---
1. Were you ever flagged for pvp? Could anybody attack you?
---
2. Were you allowed to duel? If somebody challenged you, did the option to accept popup? Did you ever duel?
---
/r/freefolk is leaking
---
What does it drop off of mostly?
---
All GMs worked across all servers.  It was one big ass queue we were all chipping away at.  
---
In general the rule was try and avoid tickets that happened on a server you had a personal character on, that way any sort of conflict of interest wasn't possible.  Wasn't policy, so long as you handled a ticket correctly it wasn't gonna cause trouble, but it was frowned upon.
---
This is substantially higher than I expected. Compared to my job at the time (Starbucks, $7/hour) you had a pretty sweet deal going!
---
Easters Plagueland
---
At least it's relevant this weekend.
---
AWS is nice.
---
Hah I mean I’ve been having a good time. Can’t wait for official tho :)
---
I’d be inclined to say yes.
---
Did the members of your raiding guild know you were a GM?
---
Doesn't make sense here; why would a manager consult a lead if a lead is below them
---
Park undead rogue in hillsbrad. Sell goblin jumper cables recipe.
---
Most likely yeah. Though it depends on whether it's a short or long beta. If it's short they may constrain add-ons so that people test the Classic UI more.
---
If you're going to play on a PvP server Warrior or rogue is nice with blessing of freedom
---
Well spoken. People argue constantly about "hard" and "easy" as if it were a linear scale. Difficulty of mechanics, prepwork needed, and how much mistakes are punished - those are more useful discussions
---
Were you invisible or did you show up to pretend you’re just another player?
---
There are so many zones I want to level in looks like I'll be making at least 3 characters and getting them to 60 I forgot how many good zones there were.
---
Makes sense. It's not like any of those games are gonna have betas any time soon, save perhaps Diablo.
---
you forgot the /s
---
I don’t like many orcs but Vorosh is a legend
---
Can someone ELI5 what this means
---
YOU FOOL!  It is in a chest in the raptor's cove area.  
---
Because raptors use chests...right?
---
Here's another option - since you still have months until classic comes, why not use the free trial for retail. No strings attached you get to sample the bare-bones version of retail, up to level 20
---
Some tanks like it as an alternate form of CC.
---
Wow you're just the worst.
---
Did you Ban anyone back then for Using Legendary  Staff and getting randomly Ported to GM Island?
---
* **Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian**
---
What is wrong with female Tauren?
---
From the GMs perspective really common.
---
The thing is 95% of the time people petitioned in about any sort of item related thing it was the first time they ever made a request so to an individual it may have never even happened and wasn't even noticeable.  From our end it looked more like every week 100,000s of people raid and like 1000 of those will need some kinda item restoration.  Different people every time but every raid reset new request rolled in.
---
If you were a serial item restorer we would strongly encourage you to clean up your act.  We really didn't want players relying on this, as we had so many peoples items to restore as it was, so it became case by case after the first few times.
---
My body is ready!!
---
You're right. Here it goes /s
---
I have 692 days /played on my paladin (that's over 16,600 hours) and I still want to beta test this game. Wtf is this addiction
---
(Finish Dire Maul run) \*cast teleport\* Sorry guys, I didn't get portals.
---
Okaaaay dude
---
That. Is. THE. Worst!
---
Kinda did that on a pserver, starting the week vanilla was announced.. but i knew it would happen, so i played off-faction *and* off-class. jumping back in on my preferred faction and my preferred class/spec should feel fresh enough.
---
What are your questions? I can answer them honestly. PvE and PvP wise.
---
In fact domaa will be down at your local record store this Tuesday from four 'till nine just giving away the hot dickings.
---
It will be interesting to see how the handle the Beta, as I assume it won't be open beta. 
---
Will you have to have a current WoW Sub to play in the Beta, for example?
---
Interesting that it's 1.13.2. 
---
The BlizzCon demo was 1.13.0, so I wonder if they had a private alpha/beta that they labeled 1.13.1.
---
Not only drivel, but fanbois ruining the game for senpai noticing them.
---
Stuff like this happens: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWAdB8IEb_o
---
I won't stop until every single snacky cake...is in my mouth!
---
There are some very hidden areas that are inaccessible without using gm commands or hacks. Not many people have seen everything. You can set up your own private server and explore tho.
---
If this game releases one day after my birthday it will be a great present.
---
I mean, they wear jewelry.  I was always disturbed by the implications of that in Vanilla.
---
Congratulations, and good on you for discussing things way ahead of time!
---
"I didn't mean it lol l2read"
---
Did you ever come across players ERPing? Like unintentionally.
---
I strictly played PvP servers, but with today's playerbase, I would strongly consider RP-PvP just to avoid the general jackassery of unabated foolishness intent on ruining anyone else's existence.
---
We liked them!  If you kept sending them in after the first one, or were doing it all the time we may have had to set in, but in general the GMs wanted to make the game experience better for the player in any way they could within their power.
---
Whatever Blizzard thinks will get butts in the seats is fine by me. Streamers will do that better than giving the public a free look, I suspect.
---
Yeah, we were 3 noobs plus tank, so maybe he just wanted us out of the way
---
I guess you need to read.
---
If any dps class has the same amount of buffs (you know how to add, right?) and gear, they should easily top a paladin's dps. Hows that make no sense? (you know how to read...right?)
---
I didn't say anything about specific buffs, but he does have a large chunk of buffs.
---
Already was in a 'hur hur top end guild', I don't need to flaunt my dick around here as its pointless. Go be a shitter elsewhere and go get your granny panties in a bunch somewhere else.
---
I am in mountain standard time, and will probably look to play on the eastern standard time. There is such a population gap when you compare servers. The bonus is that I don’t have to raid late into the night. The downside is that I miss the prime time for lfg and bg during the week.
---
Irvine.  I was 50/50 on moving to Austin, a bunch of my friends went and they loved it.
---
I love Cali though and had work connections here I wanted to maintain.
---
During my time I started on Overnight 10pm-7am.  Quickly moved to morning 6am-3pm and later when I went back to school did evening 3pm-12pm.  How was your experience in Austin?  I was seriously considering it.
---
&gt;I admit that when I was young I thought rp realms were for ultra dorks
---
Same here - but I also remember a community in vanilla WoW where people didn't spam nonsense 24/7 just for the sole purpose of being notoriously annoying. Trolling is a legitimate problem in any game, and a platform that might ban players for it would be a safe haven I would gladly pay to enjoy.
---
Yeah, buddies and I rerolled horde there to fight them lol. We lost more than we won but we had fun
---
ive alpha and beta tested every release, and ive never once streamed anything.
---
Theres only a benefit to having an open beta since they need to stress test the servers.
---
Any of the demons in southern Winterspring drop it, as far as I know. Also drops fairly commonly off Kazzak.
---
Not something to do on server launch, but any new Orc / Troll. Definitely saves time getting to XR from Org.
---
Imagine that favourite old car your parents had when you were a little child, you had all your memories and toys in the backseat, but one day they sold it. This is that car but with modern technology and it's suddenly reappeared on your driveway. You're of legal age and you have your driver's license now too.
---
The streamers absolutely should and will get priority. That tiny subset of players equals an insanely disproportionate value of free advertising to potential consumers. Feel free to hate streamers all you want, but they are an effective marketing tool. They are simply a more valuable recipient than the rest of us. I'm all for more people trying out Classic, you should be too.
---
These aren't just any raptors, they're smart raptors!  Have you tasted their horns?
---
Your going to be angry if you don’t get access to something you have zero right to have? Consider it a privilege if blizzard even invites a large number of people.
---
I identify with the undead. Burdened by a cursed unlife they didn't choose and shunned by everyone they try to make their own way and carve out their own land to exist in. Plus they fight against those religious pricks in the Scarlet Crusade. 
---
Main - SM Ruin Warlock 
---
Alts - Shadow Priest, Arcane Mage
---
This is what I'm gonna do. Still can't decide between Druid, Paladin, Warrior and Hunter. so I'm gonna try to get to level 20-30 with each and do some dungeons and give me somewhat of an idea of what I wanna do.
---
WOTLK is my expansion. I LOVED it. 5 years from now a WOTLK release would have me the most hyped for a video game ever
---
Dont forget to walk backwards in pvp and turn with your arrow keys
---
So it wasn't a remote job then? You actually went to a blizzard facility while you were on the clock?
---
Probably should've offered a free character move if you wanted to switch
---
100%
---
Should be something on the official forums I think.
---
No I meant everything I said, you just don't know how to read.
---
How fancy!
---
EVERYBODY GET OUT OF MY WAY I'M GETTING IN THE BETA AND NO ONE IS GONNA STOP ME
---
All I see on the official forums is people posting guild recruitment msge
---
Looking for a guild. 
---
* North America (Eastern timezone) 
---
* Willing to roll Ally or Horde
---
* PVP server
---
* Desired raid times: weekends 8p-1a
---
Happy to provide more details upon request.
---
Or even worse... Hey can I get IF port? Yeah sure thing! *Casts Darnassus port* ... dude wtf? Sorry, I only had money for one portal...
---
Would your progress on a character not carry over to official servers?
---
Loot council is horribly corrupt and plays heavily into favoritism
---
Nothing that would give me an in game advantage over any other player.  When GMs, or any employee, played they played as anyone else.
---
The free subscription for me and 2 friends was awesome though, but it was mostly cool swag outside of the game that were the best perks.  To clarify the comp'd accounts were the free subs and we applied them to our accounts we had before I was an employee.  Account ownership is taken pretty seriously by Blizzard, so it's generally best to keep everything visible and on the up and up.
---
If I could clear up one myth it would be that GMs were running around playing the game or throwing parties on GM Island.  GM Island was boring and we were there to help you guys enjoy the game first and foremost.  The fun part of the job was making WoW a better experience for everyone, so when we went home and played ourselves we could enjoy it as much as everyone else!
---
During Vanilla I played as a a Night Elf Priest, but then re-rolled on a fresh server as an Undead Priest which I ranked up to Rank 13.  I also played as an Orc Warrior in BC and a NE Rogue for a brief time in WOTLK before I moved on from WoW.  
---
There were a fair amount of GMs who were real hardcore players.  I was playing pretty darn hardcore during my morning shift days.  Not all GMs played like that though, it was a really good mix of all types of players, and as a result we had the ability to tap into a lot of different mind sets players had when they played, cause generally there was a GM with a similar play style and perspective.
---
I think it's mostly because when you ask a question in general/trade chat you are more likely to see helpful responses and less likely to see nonsense.
---
Of course some folks are always going to be immature (me included), but I respect the mindset of playing a game for the fun of it, rather than for the self-gratification of talking down to someone I don't know, because it makes me feel less of the pain of being unloved and unwanted.
---
And from what I'm told, the community of most RP-PvP servers as a whole tends to be more laid back about being a normal human being than on the super-dork RP-PvE servers where saying anything out of character results in being ostrasized and/or reported to GM's.
---
What makes you think they will have dynamic respawns?
---
Imagine being a streamer and being relegated to simply being a marketing tool. Omega.
---
Achievements smh
---
Oh they haven't mentioned dynamic respawns but it's a good idea imo.
---
i'm really excited to see them as they used to be. i joined in cata when they got changed to level 35-40/40-45 and so they became a fun place to stop through on the long journey to max level. it's so hard to imagine them as a dangerous and end game zone, but i like them a lot so i'm looking forward to it
---
Clearly you paid to get in and believe you're entitled to it.
---
Just because you happened to have expendable income for a demo, that does not make you a bigger fan than someone else. Nor does it mean you are more "ideal" or qualified to beta test a game we all love.
---
While I do agree with the latter half of what you said, I believe IO scores at face value don't tell the whole story, yes. However, (with all the respect to you) it feels a bit arbitrary to not see an IO score as an achievement in itself, cause it's essentially a timestamp; just from a third party website. So in essence I believe achievements don't always tell the entire story, too. But then it comes down to categorizing which achievement tells a better face value story. So it starts to get a bit opinionated with some hard to ignore facts thrown in.   
---
IO scores do attempt to breakdown your willingness to be better. If you saw someone with an IO of 1300 in Oct/Nov in BFA, it was the above average score of most individuals who cared to push M+. The sad truth that I heavily agree on is that, it only tells of your past accomplishments; the downside is: with a system like this you basically have to start over again if you are coming back to the game- but alone. Although, it can be used in a "resume" format when looking guilds or joining M+ teams.
---
My guess is they were at least a Lead GM if not higher.  I definitely didn't get the option to look like Illidan :(
---
The elites at the bottom.
---
if they treat this in the same manner as all previous WoW expac betas, you will not need an active sub to be eligible for a beta invite
---
September 23rd is the end of summer
---
Stay strong brother. Ive been working on a 7 month classic wow edge.
---
Hey! i would just like to know your honest experience playing a priest in vanilla - Did you feel the class was balanced and in shape with the other classes in PvP and PvE?
---
Looks like F5 season started
---
Month and half-2 months.  
---
  Beta this early basically confirms mid july release, classic summer, the whole shebang.
---
Grypon service is too expensive , factions especially some of them really strict about teratory for some other factions. I accidentally start with nightmare mode and happen to spawn middle East and needs so much grinding to change it.
---
It is almost impossible to change spec after 35 needs too much grinding and time consuming with all daily grinds
---
Graphics really good tho
---
Woosh
---
I've gotten into every WoW beta and some alphas (except Vanilla).
---
If I don't get an invite to Classic, **the one beta I'm seriously looking forward to the most**, I'm going to be seriously disappointed, lol.
---
Wasn’t that the demo patch number?
---
I haven't got a chance to listen yet. The #2 guild on my vanilla server, which were hit on our tails, were called Onslaught. Is it the same guild from: Alliance - Agamaggan?
---
No... no they dont, they beat HunTARDS.
---
Piles of cash is enough for me to pretend to be friends with all of my lonely neckbeard fans.
---
No, tickets in general were taken in the order submitted.  However there generally was a bit of queue monitoring by some of the GM managers, so they could catch things that were problematic, like a gold spammer.  If you put in Stuck and got your ticket to skip the queue this was likely how it happened.  Stuck was something that was a real quick fix most time, so if those were caught it may have been quickly handled.
---
I'm sure you know, but just a friendly word of advise ...I am fully confident, that trying to share a character story on a normal PvP server would result in non-stop harassment from 90% of its player-base.  
---
I mean, I'm not into building stories, or anything like that, but I can at least appreciate the thought and effort someone might take to do this, even if I would rather not participate myself.  
---
I think if I played on an RP-PvP server (which I might do to avoid the annoying trolls on "normal" servers - which are FAR WORSE than most RP'ers I've encountered), and found myself in a dungeon group of people full-on RP'ing, I'd probably just take the "silent bob" role and simply offer a nod, so as not to break their fun, since I wouldn't be interested in joining in. Hopefully that would be accepted.  
---
Basically as long as people didn't get weird and/or sexually explicit, I'd welcome the change from the annoying players intentionally trying to ruin everyone else's lives.
---
You are a bit wiser than you once were
---
Can anyone give a retard a link? The new battle.net website is garbage, not even the link provided on the official website works:  
---
https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/194729
---
Yup
---
And be sure to walk the fine line between talking very slowly, but not too slow for too much of your audience to stop watching.
---
Hell yeah you should! Best game of all time!! Enjoy!

I agree with both of these, but I'll add Warrior in PvP is a button mashing simulator. You have to change stances for basically everything you want to do in PvP. It's really hectic and fun.
---
Soak in the glory that will be barrens chat.
---
Late tbc or early wotlk it got changed
---
Also occasionally tell how you feel. "This is amazing guys" "I cannot believe this". Stretch that shit.
---
I mean you'll have alts, this gear still helps in pvp, offspecs, getting dope pieces that look cool like Corrupted Ashbringer, Atiesh, etc.
---
There are reasons to play the game after killing KT, just because your personal goal is killing bosses does not mean it's the same for everyone else. Classic is also a more social game so plenty of people will stick around just to play with their friends.
---
you're on drugs dude
---
Blizz isn't a private server, if their many other betas are any indication this will be invite only.
---
I cant imagine a lot of money will be spent in the first month, no one will be twinking until about month 2 or 3 and absolutely no one will have the gold to spend 15g on a green item +1 Stam Chest
---
I think there's a good chance they might decide it would be better for hype/marketing to NDA the beta and save the streamer hype for launch week.
---
You missed a step though. After you take the path, go to where the water drops into the sea and get the crappy weapon from the crate. It will vendor for enough to cover a couple flights.
---
Tig ol' biddies
---
Well, the horde doesn't have gnomes, so it's a no brainer for me
---
I saw it as inevitable.
---
We couldn't staff enough GMs to answer all the tickets, regardless of what the issue was, we were constantly bursting at the seams.  Sometimes we would win a battle and get the queue to 0, but as soon as a patch hit we always worked from behind.
---
Item restorations in particularly were real long and time consuming, you had to verify everything which took some time.  It wasn't a job they trusted to anyone for good reason, but it also meant less people could help get the item restoration queue down.  
---
What I think Blizzard did was find the right compromise.  They addressed the main issue, while still maintaining the need to be able to restore raid items.  Loot was far and away the issue that players got the most emotional about, but it was clear they needed to strike a balance to put out the experience the players want to have.
---
Dang, maybe you're right. I'd probably be one of those players if I joined RP-PvP, because I don't think I could commit to walking in cities once a mount becomes available. And if you think I'm going to have a character story, you'd be kidding yourself.  
---
I would hope to just have an emote macro for RP situations that says something to the effect of my character being silent and leave it at that. I'm a normal human and I wouldn't feel the need to be a super-dork, but I don't want to be constantly abject to the trolls tuning up for their grand ole' tradechat diatribes.  
---
But how else would we find a way of avoiding the nonsense of grown adults acting like 5 yr old children just because they feel the need to be as impossibly difficult in every situation they can possibly be? How else can we avoid the political tantrums - because I'm a sucker for that, especially when someone is being particularly ignorant, intentionally or not. I'd rather not see that sort of thing, and "just close trade chat" or "just ignore" or "just don't play the game" isn't fair to everyone who wants a peaceful experience just playing the game without the general jackassery...  
---
I dunno, but after trying a pserver last month I'm kinda wondering if it's even worth playing the game anymore at this point, since everywhere one goes it's constant spam from other players or gold vendors.
---
Blizzard has a big dropbox to let people download shit from. Today they're uploading shit named WOW_CLASSIC_BETA.
---
I didnt play vanilla, but i did start about 1/3 of the way through Wrath, so i saw them the old way for quite a while, and definitely leveled a fair amount of toons through there.
---
Also spent plenty of time there farming for the Barons mount in Strat.
---
Does anyone know if the client will be a separate exe or will there be some sort of internal switching over n the current client based on what server you choose?
---
Orcs literally invaded a planet to commit more genocide after having committed genocide on the races on their home planet.
---
I mean..it really doesn't. Outside of your guild do you ever interact with anyone on your server on purpose? The answer is no.
---
Hey Mikimao, i didnt expect a reply! thank you!
---
Im jsut trying to understand the process a bit better, did you ever get any specific warden requests to investigate or was there a process that was followed? or was it just autobans?
---
90% of people who play on PvP servers do it for the false bravado. They really aren't any good at PvP, but want everyone to think they are hardcore players. But if you are good at your craft, and learn to win fights by picking on players at or slightly above your level, you might find yourself having a real good time hunting and being hunted instead of simply focused on pulling one mob at a time with no regard for personal safety...
---
No, it doesn't make me a bigger fan or more ideal. 
---
There's no way to truly know who is a bigger fan... And a more ideal candidate for a beta is someone who is going to play a lot, and report bugs.
---
However... Someone who is already willing to spend their time and money on a demo is very likely a bigger, more committed and ideal candidate for a beta. Notice I said very likely, and not definitely.
---
Obviously having expendable income is a huge variable here. But that's not the point.
---
[I would highly recommend you learn about the topic before you make judgement.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m5P_n5njCQ)
---
I thought it was a great compromise to the situation.  Clearly the issue needed to be addressed because it was a huge point of contention to the player base.  At the same time Blizzard knows their players really well and know raid issues are gonna happen and they need some way to resolve that.
---
In general the rule was if it was a legal trade, and they petitioned in soon enough and their story checked out we did everything we could to put the loot in the correct players hands.  It was a long process though, a normal GM answered the tickets and detailed what needed to be done .  They sent it to a specialist who verified everything through in game logs and restored the items.  It was a lengthy process and that queue was hard to keep at a reasonable time.
---
What if it was an actual person but definitely a gold farmer? I used to have know a Chinese guy who worked a shift on a character that farmed Blasted Lands. He said it was like him and 2 or 3 others working that character in shifts. He said it was a decent job, he was treated well, and paid decently (not amazing but not like sweatshop either).
---
One time we got him to dress up in farmer's overalls and a pitchfork with a straw hat. Perfect farmer gear lol. We also took him to DM once and a 20g bag dropped and he gave me it for free.
---
But yeah were only bots not allowed, like even if it was people on a shift it was allowed? Just the selling gold part obviously.
---
Damn. So many feels just looking at this map.
---
I am rolling an Undead Priest when Classic comes out. Super hyped about that. I am playing a human warlock on a private server right now specifically to not ruin the fresh horde and priest experience I will get when Classic is released. It's the perfect solution, I can get acclimated to vanilla wow and pass the time waiting for Classic without ruining the experience =)
---
Imagine being a person that thinks getting paid thousands of dollars an hour to play a video game is a negative.
---
July 16th confirmed.
---
It's a pretty essential part of your kit. Possibly at very high gear levels you could skip it because just dps'ing will be more effective, but around blue/t1/t2 gear level mana burn destroys healers who could otherwise heal through your damage, and imp mana burn drastically helps your ability to spam mana burn.
---
Honest to god when I’m looking at videos and I see them end anywhere near 10:01-10:30 I don’t watch them.  I know they are videos they are stretching that should be 2-3 mins.  When I see a video that’s 20+ minutes I’ll sit and watch the whole thing because I know they normally just have a lot of information.
---
I've recently been playing a lot on a private server to get a general gist for the game, I was going to play a rogue as main and a warrior with wife who was going to play a warlock, then it changed to Hunter, then Shadow Priest, then Mage but now i've decided to main a Warlock and wife is dead set on Shaman with my Warrior. I dont regret doing it at all, beats waiting till actual release and starting over 4 or 5 times
---
Did you do any GMing in the official private server that was capped at level 19 for the low level PVP tournament that rewarded TBC beta keys? Those were some of the funnest times in WoW for me.
---
One time outside of WSG entrance the GMs showed themselves and started spawning crazy mobs on us. Tons of murlocs, infernals, a raid boss for a second (then delete it or something).
---
They've uploaded the game files to their Content Delivery Network, which are the servers that then distribute the files to everyone downloading. This would indicate they have a build of the game ready to go that they intend to release soon.
---
Didnt we already know this?
---
They said it'd be using the modern engine and architecture from the start.
---
Correct, within limits (azeroth zones are 1-60, tbc and wotlk are 60-80 etc). Good... but only for solo player who enjoys world of ghostcraft. From design perspective, it makes levels and any sense of progress even more obsolete, since in PvP players are also scaled to each other to some degree (eg. Your chaos bolt at 114 will hit enemy 117 as if you were 117). 
---
The game feels so arbitrary, I'm surprised the slogan for retail isn't "Come and press buttons!"
---
Exactly, introduce x-realm bgs at the same time as in vanilla. #nochanges
---
I’m not a YouTube expert. Do they gain anything from making a video longer than 10 mins?
---
The funniest was definitely the guy who petitioned in (posted this one earlier) calling us "BLIXX" because of the payoff with friends.  I still laugh and enjoy that memory.
---
Disturbing, oh man, it can be yikes seeing how far the internet can go.  On the very rarest occasion you might see a ticket with a bomb threat cause an item wasn't restored or something.  People also say some pretty graphic stuff to others that really warrants getting them out of the game immediately.  
---
I will say this, WoW chat is hosted by a private company, if you say something illegal on there, Blizzard has that now.
---
I just never understood the point of being an opposing faction without the ability to engage that faction unless on a designated battlefield - but maybe that's just  me.  
---
Also I never understood creating character stories or some of the other "RP" rules, that to me made the game less of a game, and more of an alternate lifestyle - not my kind of gig.  
---
But what I DO understand is creating a safe place where tomfoolery and general jackassery is discouraged and avoided by the playerbase, in a way that basically forces anyone who is a turd to either play nice, or go play somewhere else, where they can be a turd all they want.  
---
I don't like turds. I just want to have fun playing a game in an environment that basically enjoys the game for what it is without making it into something it isn't, and also shuts down the trolls whenever they pop up.  
---
I'd even pay a little extra for that...
---
I mean, I'm not gonna play poorly, but I'm definitely gonna just play how I want.
---
I have this 0/25/26 Shaman build I wanna fuck around with. All the improved totems, nightfall, healing talents for increased armor and cheaper totems, time some lesser heals and chain heals between swing timers while buffing my melee group.
---
Just a general utility character, helpful in whatever I'm doing but truly embracing it's not the best at anytime.
---
Meme? I dunno, man. Probably. It's a very old game though, and we're all being memes for playing it, at least I'm having fun.
---
Separate executable in the same way the PTR does.
---
neither do the players.
---
both bots and players however still give the data needed to tell the devs how many servers to make.
---
Nope. People have received beta invites in the past without active subscriptions, you just need to be lucky.
---
I knew it. But I kept being told I was wrong and it would be 7.3.5 forever.
---
PILE ON !
---
and dead realms aren't?
---
So why not ask for extra cost to pay for a dedicated GM to shut down the trolls? That way trolls have to pay extra to troll (which automatically shuts down 99% I would think), and then provides REAL consequences for being a troll.
---
thanks for the info, and how about improved vampiric embrace? is that usually specced into for pvp? I see some builds have it and others don't so I am curious what you think
---
Buy Adderall,kek
---
Same.
---
depends on how they have us test it. If it is just a bunch of fresh servers where you get to make level 1 characters i probably wont play it to avoid getting burnt out, unless they call for a stress test of some sort. Now if they give us premade characters of varying levels/gear to test certain dungeons/zones/raids it will be a super fun little taste of what is to come and Ill spend as much time as I can in order to help make sure everything is crispy and ready to go.
---
I think it's because conceptually farming the honor is easier right?  
---
You can solo grind HWL, but you need a 40man coherent raid to do naxx.. so surely the rewards should outweigh HWL.
---
Could you give us a rundown of some of the ingame abilities GMs had access to with their spawned character? Could you even customize them? From what I remember morphing, size and floating(the proper kind) were some of them.
---
Bonus: What did the GM client look like? How much was GUI/text based? Any frustrating functions missed? I'd imagine it got some updates over the course you were there.
---
Bonus 2: If available. willing and permissioned, any screenshots to share from the action as GM?
---
Thanks for doing this!
---
You know...it may be time to start thinking about what names i want...
---
&gt; . The Priest would also go to ZG and AQ20 to earn the DKP and let upgrades get sharded just to avoid losing any DKP.
---
That sounds like an issue with your guild leadership and not dkp.
---
I stopped playing during early WOTLK, and I haven't really kept up since.  From what I have seen I think that it was the natural process of them trying to improve a game that was built for 2004 era gaming and apply it to 2019 era gaming.  WoW originally did a lot of things that MMO players at the time thought were to far only for them to be exactly what the genre needed in order to make it more accessible.  Once you do that to much though, intended or not, it just becomes a different game.
---
Classic on the other hand, that is exactly the game I am interested in.  I am really excited for it to come out and definitely plan on playing it!
---
You can insert an add for sweet shekelz
---
https://battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html
---
Both.  Help the customer was first and foremost but they wanted you to be productive as well.  If you quickly go through tickets but don't resolve the issue they just end up petitioning again, and no GM wants to hear their name called on the GM floor that a player asked for them specifically by name. ;)
---
I know they get money for more viewed minutes but what happens after 10 mins?
---
This meme is so overused
---
i know about the topic. i don't care how much money they make, just because they stream their gameplay doesn't mean they deserve special privilege. if anything, they are losers that play video games all day. give it to people that are genuinely passionate about the game, and not to those who have high view counts and will not give a shit/will not report any bugs they come across.
---
Yeah they are for sure - but blizzard making an announcement saying they’re merging realms will bring more attention than dead realms existing. Especially when having to let shareholders etc know
---
Easy to get since half of it is farmable and the other half has a 50% chance every week.
---
The event is cake too,
---
IIRC GMs spawn into it before teleporting or going elsewhere.
---
There were so many servers when the tickets all come flooding in it sort blends it all together.
---
The thing that was more killer to us personally is some servers had worse connections than others to our tool and would crash more.  Particularly when they were newer ones.  Server were grouped together and it wouldn't be uncommon to hear someone yell one of those group names out angrily at the sky, lol.
---
No you are not, do it with your spare mana :)
---
Mostly to give the GM a neutral place to be.  It really was just tons of avatars standing around.
---
The prison wasn't to common to use, but needed more info, but not having them run around causing trouble was typically the main reason.
---
I was in Final Countdown with my brother SubXaero. I can't remember if I played as IceDragon in that guild, but yeah I was there from when we were just starting MC until TBC came out, then I switched to an Aussie server, since I moved to Korea for a year.
---
I still have a videoes from our first time we killed Ragnaros, Razorgore, and Vael that were edited with music, and I have the original captures from 2006.
---
Hit me up if you want to watch them.
---
I think imp VE is ok but you'll have to sacrifice darkness or shadow weaving to get it and I think the general consensus is you're better off maximising your damage (which will also incidentally increase your VE benefit) rather than handicap your damage but get more health back.  
---
You could drop healing focus to get it but without healing focus you really can't ever drop form to heal when there's a hunter pet or rogue about which would be a really big disadvantage in its own way.  
---
I'm hardly an authority on vanilla spriest though so who knows.
---
It's not been confirmed 'very soon' at all quit spreading disinfo
---
Nah they still have it, you have to kill quillboars to get the silver back.
---
LETTUCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!

Why else would we call them **re**fried beans?

I will always love vanilla WoW the most, but if I have to go Expansion TBC, cause my name was on the credits, near the very very very end, lol.
---
I'm not sure I consider myself knowledgeable enough on war craft lore for the 2nd one though, I was always just amazed at what did make the cut.

Literally the last

Iirc the "connected realm" merges on retail were only mentioned as a news forum post, I doubt they'd even be a footnote in reports to Activision Blizzard shareholders
---
Welcome to the real world, where money affects status. Also doesn't mean they won't give feedback if anything they probably know game mechanics more than the average person in beta and can use their large audience to discuss what needs to be tested.
---
thanks for the insight though
---
They saved for the item they wanted, allowing others to get other items in the meantime? Doesn't sound too bad.
---
Mostly we chatted through a client that had connections to the servers.  Occasionally we did go in game.  Didn't really chill at GM island much, nothing to do there.   Although one GM island story you just reminded me of was I used it to decipher what someone was saying between Alliance and Horde with my 2 GM characters.  None of the GMs knew about the combinations that came out as other words to the opposite faction so we had to test it there, lol.
---
In general I didn't run around to much, the main focus is really helping the players.
---
I don't know specifically what happened but my guess is the GM acted on their own will and lost their job.  I suppose it's possible it could have been an honest mistake and they fixed it and everything was ok, but in general the integrity of the game is taken very seriously.
---
Warrior is perfect with paladin. Make sure she saves any intellect gear from quests so she can be a more effective healer in dungeons.
---
Yeah I farm DM E quite a bit on my holy priest. Luckily it's very lucrative to do rune and orb runs in Strath/Scholo. It's more fun than grinding DM that's for sure. 
---
In the end it seems like Herbalism is the way to go
---
Hey sorry to piggy back but are you more hyped for this than other iterations of the game? Like retail, legion, etc.
---
TipTronique, your comment ID had a Happy Number in it!

 The Happy Number was 19, and your comment ID was el5oj19.

---
 I'm a bot, beep boop. Downvote to delete this comment.
---
Why completely waste their only opportunity to gauge interest? This is the only way they can know if they need 10 servers or 50.
---
I play on a private server and just love stopping and bugging people. A lot of the time they open trade and hand me gold.
---
I can't wait to play a beta for a game that I played for over a whole year. Over 9000 hours. On one character. Can't fucking wait. Seriously.
---
My favourite race in Warcraft 3 was undead so I went undead.
---
How does counting the number of players who play the classic beta not give an indication on how many servers you need?
---
Why? We don’t get to bug test classic on private servers. Oh right, everyone thinks beta is just early access, and not a testing period. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I respect not wanting to play the beta to avoid burnout. But telling people to just play private servers kind of goes against what beta is for
---
The request itself was common, but it involved one GM Taking the ticket and noting what needed to be done and then a GM specialist verifying everything and issuing the restoration.  
---
Loot issues in general are among the most common in all of their various forms, but most players probably never even used their first one let alone a 2nd.  If a player made a habit out of continuing to request loot restores, we would generally try get them to be more careful and that they may not get anymore.  We wanted some accountability, since it was such a common request.
---
Paladin.
---
I don't like this because it is anti-vanilla imo. If you were being dumb because you actually didn't know better you got a pass. You just had to learn from your mistakes.
---
I'm hoping for some simulated launches.
---
Friday to sunday and you can level 1-20.
---
Then they can test their server infrastructure and play around with sharding / dynamic respawn etc.
---
Sure, if your goal is to test classic in the beta then go right ahead. But I don't think people are getting hyped because they are excited to test and find bugs, but because they want a taste of classic before it comes out. And thats why to those people who aren't interested in bugs but just want to play the game they should just play private servers instead
---
What's your address? I'm going to have the power shut down for your house so you can't spoil yourself any more /s
---
Is this warlock your first experience in Vanilla/Classic?
---
Can even 1 person respond to this please:
---
is classic WoW coming out as patch 1.12 or patch 1.13?
---
And what does this mean if its truly patch 1.13? what are the updates? there is no info on google about patch 1.13 or what that would entail.
---
thanks!
---
Honestly actual beta testing is not everyones cup of tea.
---
Your better off waiting for retail launch, your toon will progress and won't wipe were as beta will come to an end and you'll deal with potentially major bugs/disconnections and what not
---
Thanks for replying. Were playing Horde though as much as I'd love a paladin.
---
This guy Twinks.
---
How come no one has their trusty poop sock anymore. I am really disappointed.
---
This is pathetic. I think there is finally going to be an MMORPG that is the WoW-Killer.
---
And the WoW-Killer is Classic WoW.
---
Same. I want to go into classic as fresh as possible. I'm just looking forward to the retail community's reaction to the beta.
---
You
---
Are
---
Magnificent.
---
Then a lot of people will fuck off and vanilla dies, just like with the private servers.
---
Once I moved on from Blizzard it was out of the game industry all together.  Currently I run my own business as an Ice Skating Coach, and work at a few different rinks.  For my first two months at Blizzard I was working there over night and then teaching ice skating lessons in the morning, lol.  I burnt out on it though, so I took some time to just soak in all the Blizzard, I'm really glad I did.
---
Definitely go paladin imo
---
I'm pretty sure they've always been horde. They did mention some server from Vanilla but I don't recall what it was, but Fei has 700d played on shaman only I believe he said.
---
charge has not worked properly on any pserver I have played on yet, so I can imagine people who never played live arriving at that conclusion.
---
I can’t wait till people have to play against warriors who’s abilities actually work properly.
---
PSA: If you choose Asia as your starting area the first 18-24 levels are harder. 
---
Also for some reason you will need to stick to 2 characters, usually a female and a male. And, you can't leave them until you find company that they deem "appropriate".
---
Also! if you mess up on quests, they will randomly beat you with a stick.
---
What so you'd rather have no idea what the beta looks like if you don't get in?
---
Oh? I wonder if that means support for multi-core processors? Which was added in 8.1. That would be interesting... not that anyone would actually NEED multiple cores on Classic of course. BFA brought back weather aswell, not as intense as Classic but its okay, i'd imagine they're just recreating the weather anyways though.
---
Gosh can you imagine how well Classic should run with Multi-Core support, DX12, WoD model loading improvements, Legion terrain loading improvements, ect previous expansion improvements. And of course the trusty ol SSD
---
[removed]
---
Based on WC3 as others have said. I loved the idea of paladins before playing WoW in DND so naturally I rolled one. Had no idea about the free mount at 40, just that everyone was jealous about it.
---
Absolutely!  I was really into WoW prior to working there.  GMs played exactly as normal players though.  When I played it was on the normal client like everyone else.  When you are on the clock you log into the GM client and do GM work with an account totally separate from your personal one.
---
I lead a raiding guild and ranked my character up to Rank 13 when I wasn't GMing.
---
I keked
---
To be fair, the bunch of nerd friends are only running one server, while blizzard will be running hundreds at the same time, but I still see your point
---
There will be no dynamic respawn. Even the one time Blizzard used it they said it was a failure.
---
100% paladin
---
Hacker for sure. I heard he had water walking without any elixirs
---
Do it pussy, if everything is dead it doesn’t matter if you only have 1hp left
---
Since you said you're going horde, try out shaman or priest to support your pvp buddies. Or if you're more into the getting the fuck out of the situation mindset, then roll druid.
---
As a caster, getting your WAND! Everyone is going to be farming linen cloth to make enough bolts/robes to disenchant to get your level 5 wand, so you want to be ahead of the pack.
---
&gt;Finding them in the first place is the hard part though.
---
Would you guess that today, this is much easier to do?  I don't know how much player interaction data is generated through wow, so I'm not sure how costly this would be, but I feel like this could be the type of problem that you could address with machine learning?
---
good meme tabs
---
Modern WoW: basically a lobby.  
---
Classic WoW: a "living" world.  
---
Classic WoW is what an MMO should be, Modern WoW is Blizzard trying to bring WoW into the new game era (fortnite etc)
---
what exactly other than interface eoements can you datamine from the beta client
---
What spec would you recommend? I dont mind healing but I'm worried I wouldn't be able to farm anything.
---
Oh yeah, Deadmines was referred to as VC... I'm an idiot.
---
What do you to do, man?
---
Heal 
---
Priest would be fun to roll with your friends but it's a more difficult leveling experience compared to their classes.
---
Dps
---
Hunter is relatively easy to jump into and provides a high skill ceiling if you ever develope the desire to go the extra mile.
---
I did until WOTLK but I haven't played since.
---
I just think at that time I was ready to move on, the game had changed a lot and many of my friends weren't as active as they once were.  Vanilla WoW, and even TBC to a slightly lesser degree was part of my social scene as much as anything, that was probably the most significant change for me during WOTLK.
---
I am really excited for classic though, I cannot wait!
---
its blizzard , i expect a pay to beta
---
If you want DPS I'd say go hunter, just sit back and pump big damage. Someone runs up at you, trap them and get range back. Probably the easiest class to be decent with, great in world PVP as well.
---
The problem is that you think I'm intending to convey they are receiving special privilege. It's a basic marketing tactic and a reality of the corporate perspective of twitch. It's such an extremely low risk/high reward situation on their end, they'd be stupid not to do it. People tend to view me trying to express the reality of the situation as me condoning or advocating for it. You can debate all you want about the morality of the situation, and I'm not going to disagree with you, because I don't disagree with you. If you can explain to me what metric Blizzard can use in order to distribute game keys in a way that is going to reach those types of players you mentioned with a relatively equal ROI, I'd love to ponder it. I try to keep my own personal feelings of the matter out of the discussion, and discuss how I think a business is going to look at the situation, because businesses like money.
---
What was cringy about it? A dude hyped about a potential beta that we’ve been waiting forever for. Did you actually cringe when you watched it? Do you know what cringe means?
---
Hello RealDisagreer,
---
Unfortunately after review, it appears you are not eligible for this item to be restored at this time.  I'm sorry we weren't able to help you with this issue, but is there anything else I can help you with?
---
Priest or Warlock. You can be either an icredibly effective healer or sit back and DoT everything down.
---
I've been opted into every single beta since they've had opt-ins. I don't think I've gotten a single one, ever.
---
there was a "pre bc" bc patch
---
i will never forget because i was playing a lock i could 3v1 people in av it was so amazing
---
Who do we have to pay/suck for a key?
---
That’s fair. I read your comment more as ‘why wait when you can do it now’ and didn’t even consider it as being in the context you said... in which case o actually agree with you 100%. If it’s a limited beta, and you don’t intend to test, then save space for those who will.
---
GM RP was a personal style kind of thing.  We had some key things we were supposed to do, but in general they wanted a level of personal authenticity.  RP was encouraged I would say.
---
well we didn't get a release date but we did get those beta files so i'll count it.
---
keks in paladin
---
I won't. If I wanted to play now, I'd play on a pserver. I am waiting it out so I don't have to do things over again.
---
BarberEv, your comment ID had a Happy Number in it!
---
 The Happy Number was 44, and your comment ID was el5ps44.
---
It probably will get pushed back so people can get 60 on the beta and test raid content. I’d say release is still 6+months away.
---
Or rogue, so you can Vanish and leave them.
---
Sometimes those are the most fun groups!
---
And the carpet is still stained with that Burger King soda you dropped that one time.
---
I also mained a warrior in vanilla.. Maybe you and i played completely different but there are a lot of tricks to nail hunters down as a warrior.
---
Why would we need to test raid content? 
---
Nothing has changed as far as balance and tuning. Literally the only thing that needs to be tested is performance and you don’t need a six month beta for that.
---
It neither confirms nor denies. We have no idea how long this beta will be, nor when it will be released. We can do nothing but guess and wait patiently.
---
we litterally know nothing more than we did yesterday other than a beta client exists.
---
is this a version ready for the public to see? dont know
---
does this give us any expected date? no
---
the only interesting stuff is if someone gets their hands on it and can datamine client side settings we care about.
---
but even then there is prob disabled retail features still in it
---
It's pretty close, but there are certain talents that are good for dps that aren't for tanks, and vice versa
---
Talents for Tanks:
---
* Thick Hide
---
* Primal Fury
---
* Improved Enrage

Talents for DPS:

* Blood Frenzy

* Natural Shapeshifter

Lol, I know you are getting downvoted to hell but I loved this post.
---
Yeah but that’s just like your opinion.
---
Lol  this comment made me laugh way too hard
---
If they wanted to test raid content they wouldn't make people level to 60 first.
---
The two that stand out the most were Leeroy Jenkins and Elite Pwnge.  I bet if I think more of this I will have even more.
---
Leeroy was great because it happened while I was still at the original building and it was my first major WoW moment that happened while I was there.  Someone found it combing the WoW forums and next thing you know were all crowded around laughing out asses off screaming Leeroy Jenkins.  We enjoyed the stuff every bit as much as anyone.  It was the same thing for elite pwnge except that had like a whole WoW Saga, so we were eagerly awaiting new installments.
---
Nice! I was able to get my Druid in Vanilla to Rank 13 as well. Ran with a phenomenal premade most of the time.
---
Always had pleasant interactions with GMs as well. Hell, I’d consider doing that on the weekends here or there if it was an option! Cheers.
---
[laughs in Shaman downrank totems]
---
I think there will be plenty of noobness without you adding more lol
---
How many tanks are going to pull entire rooms? How many mages are going to pull for the tank, assuming that the tank will just thunderclap and make it all better?
---
WoW had 8Millions at the end of vanilla so no, it was by far in Vanilla it grew the most.
---
Was like 300k at launch
---
Not necessarily, if they want to test raids, they can just make people max level. And the only raids that need testing are MC and ONY, BWL won't be out for at least 5-6 months after classic launches.
---
No.
---
Most warrior abilities are stance based and several have both a stance requirement and a weapon requirement (shield bash and block specifically) meaning you need good reflexes and or macros to even use all of your abilities.
---
Sure, if u want to run around in zerker stance getting nuked at +10% damage and only cast hamstring and ms you can do that, but being a GOOD warrior means using all of your talents when they are needed.
---
Pro tip: even taunt has a use in vanilla PvP.
---
This is a test for the servers, not really a demo in the sense of the word.  
---
  Don't expect it to last that much.
---
But *why*. 
---
This isn’t a new raid with unknown mechanics or boss health that needs to be tuned. All that needs to be plugged in an the numbers from 1.12. 
---
Literally nothing is changing in regards to raid tuning so what use is testing it?
---
Ah yes, can't wait for the classic summer.  
---
  In november
---
Build number is 1.13. 
---
Content is patch 1.12
---
In a lot of ways it's the nicest way to go about it.
---
Yeah like ur mum
---
Iirc every raiding priest we had (5-6) used benediction at some point.
---
Holy shit this made me so angry. Some jackass paladin legit tried to do this. He was specced as a ret and refused to use any healing spells, only bandages.
---
i can definitely see myself spending a lot of time farming for the baron mount haha, i still do even to this day.
---
im especially curious about western plaguelands bc the general atmosphere of eastern seems to be about the same, but western got a pretty drastic shift from ''creepy and plagued'' to ''sad but recovering'' which intrigues me
---
im the plug hit me up ahaha
---
Will one's progress on beta not carry over to full release?
---
by BC launch I was off the GM floor and into a different department that involved keeping the GMs accountable, so I don't remember to much.  What I do remember is anytime they added any new patch, things would go to shit for at a few days.  
---
Unfortunately didn't have a role in any GM events.  That was mostly reserved for higher tier GMs.  I did get to do a little behind the scenes raid boss testing since I was an experienced raider.  I had a lot of fun with that.
---
At first basically WoW every waking moment.  All my friends and S/O played WoW, so if I wasn't at work I was logged in or with friends talking about WoW.  As time progress and my relationship with the game changed I moved shifts and went to school in the mornings and worked at night.
---
I'm still stuck deciding on huntard or warlock, either way, *that goddamn pet is staying on aggressive*.
---
I believe the translation is; “lol bubble hearth”
---
what
---
peeeeeeeen :(
---
What was the GM response to the Corrupted Blood incident? I heard of people being teled away to quarantine them and such. When it happened, did you get some instructions from the devs on how to deal with it at all?
---
Scholo was fun as a priest. In later patches (I think 1.9 with vamp touch) I was able to full clear with two other shadow priests. Mind you we were all quite geared.
---
I thought about this the other day and I think it’s honestly my innate reaction to say fuck you to colorful and nice things. I rolled an IF Rogue originally. Ironically I rolled a human warrior later on and had a blast as well!!
---
Will your progress on a character in the beta not carry over to full release?  Why would you want to sit out the beta?
---
Ahh darn i see what you mean. Hopefully they do a lot of rebalance soon after launch
---
Haha, I actually don't remember to many specific ones, I made the one in the opening up off the top of my head.  But I can tell you a weird one I came across.
---
It wasn't uncommon for a GM to RP as a specific type of animal in game, as opposed to a human type character.  One time I had to review a GM who was opening with something to the effect of, 'You feel a tape worm wiggle up your leg and greet you' to which the player was a little weirded out...   We told him to nix the tape worm bit.
---
Over the past 2 years I have leveled 5 different characters on various servers. Im still ready for more. I have never played a mage past lvl 15. This time.. The power of cold, fire and arcane will be mine to master!
---
hunter or rogue, probably :) shadow priest can also be fun for pvp!
---
Look in the thread he commented about this already.
---
Weirdly enough, I run my own business now coaching Ice Skaters, and pretty much any related job I have the skills for in the field.  (Music editing, video analysis etc) I coach at a few different rinks.
---
&gt; Once you go Classic you dont go back
---
Wouldn't it be forward?
---
【﻿Ｆ  Ｒ  Σ  Ｓ  Ｈ】
---
Tf prot warrior with reflective disc was supposedly pretty good,
---
Then again legendaries probably make every class good at most things.
---
Started at $10 as a temp, and was $12 with benefits as a full time employee.  I worked my way up to $15 over the time I was there.  I thought it paid really well for an entry level job.
---
We'll see. Nothing is off the table yet.
---
Any tank
---
Your progress in the beta will not carry over to the full release
---
CLASSIC WOW, ON AN OPEN BETA NED
---
Leveling shaman will be a pretty miserable experience anyway...relatively speaking that is
---
Why is life so difficult?
---
The timestamps on this from tipsout video on the CDN website shows 16.04.2019 as the date of publish. 90 days untill 16.07.2019. No files have ever been on the CDN over a few months time. 16.07.2019 confirmed??
---
I don't think you understand what information IT has access to
---
Get UBRS key/tanking service and reserve first orbs from strat
---
are you still a loser?
---
Others didn't want/need the items, OP said the items got sharded because the guy didn't want to get upgrades and only wanted the annie/benny
---
That's not how beta works.....to test raids they would give you level 60's with gear....
---
thank you lol
---
ie everyone
---
My most memorable ticket I helped someone with was one where he was having trouble completing a quest.
---
It actually turned out he was dealing with more than 1 issue, and it took me some time to sort through it all.  Once I did we got to the bottom of it all, we still had the original issue, which was his quest item was in the bank.  We can't help players directly, but we can maybe give them something to think about, but he wasn't taking the hint.  Eventually I explained to him 'Yes, sometimes things in your inventory aren't on your character' just the right way and it clicked and they got the item and completed the quest.  They were so happy and thankful I was patient enough to work through it all, I still remember that one.
---
Today was the Beta announcement. The Beta was uploaded to the web on 16.04.2019....... Does this mean..... That Classic most likely will come within the next 90 days??? 16.07.2019 confirmed? JuLY!
---
Haha, whatever it was, you would have to ask their friends on Ventrillo, cause they were already out of the game if I caught you!  ;)
---
i'm buzzing my lil tits off think i'm gonna watch a 10+ min tips out vid about this on repeat tonight.... hmmm night times fuzzy tingle times
---
Can confirm am Australian, my reply is already 5 hours late.
---
they do, which is what i meant on my second line in my previous comment
---
You know. I wasn't feeling hyped until I remembered that I get to do barrens and stonetalon and ashenvale again. Super nostalgic for those zones.
---
This is GREAT news, it means future exploits/bugs can be fixed easier and with newer/updated APIs comes bigger and better addon support!
---
Because if they wait they can squeeze money out of the people who would otherwise use beta to realise they don't want to play classic
---
Classic beta is not comparable to expansion betas. They ain't developing and testing new content here, so classic beta is gonna be much shorter.
---
Probably because they’d want the test server/servers to be playable. Opening the flood gates would be to no ones benefit if it makes the game unplayable. It’s bad customer service to let so many people bash their head against their keyboards trying to get in.
---
LC is no more corrupt than any other system, and guilds with dkp or epgp can still be extremely corrupt - forcing items to people who don't want them, arbitrarily  reserving specific items for people, and so on. At least with LC you know that it's down to the trustworthiness of the people running it and it never pretends otherwise.
---
Nah, I have a pretty strong understanding of all the classes, I'm just not sure exactly what I want to play. I've switched mains from each expansion and have enjoyed all roles.
---
Thanks, I'll have to check that out, then. I usually do like 15 quests there and then they all get red and I go to the Barrens.
---
The problem is that some people believe characters are truly one in the same as the player. And that if this guy playing a rogue lies cheats and ninja loots. Then they are a scummy person in real life.  
---
This belief system is a big disconnect and the reason you will get mass downvoted because people believe you are true scum.
---
As a dagger rogue I still would have preferred windfury.
---
This isn't really a new game though. They tested the servers when Legion launched with 7.x
---
LOL  crazy.  Do you want to / plan to / hope to be invovled in classic that's coming up?  And do you plan to play it?
---
But only for game time. You can't translate that into in game gold.
---
if its anything like the original launch this will be the only thing you can do til the lag chills out
---
OMEGALUL
---
Every model and animation used in the game.
---
Not at all I have been in many guilds and have ran into minimal issues with loot council it just takes some mature people with game knowledge to run it.
---
Who knows, we'll see what the beta is for exactly and how long it's for. I'm sure they'll want a stress test of multiple people in one area, see how the sharding works for starter zones, if there's non vanilla things, etc.
---
Blizz is a multi billion dollar game publisher. They don't need open betas to determine how many people will play (which is also a really bad way of gauging potential players) as they have multiple metrics they can use. Betas are for bug testing and feedback.
---
Good point
---
Legion wasn’t an open beta either; it’s not needed.
---
You'll probably have to eventually go to the barrens. I just know that TG&gt;SF&gt;HF is the exact path I took on basically every undead character I ever made.
---
I was also in Onslaught but lost touch with people. I was the 2nd Leaf. Is the group getting back together for classic?
---
holy shit imagine being so obsessed with someone that you base your gameplay around them, what the hell is up with that? I understand people following influential speakers or innovators or movement leaders, but its a fucking video game holy shit, you play it for fun, none of it actually matters. I know me ranting is literally ironic but it just baffles me that twitch streamer diehard fans exist... it’s a game, play for fun. Don’t form a cult lmao
---
In this episode he talks about how they are going for a week 1 Rag, so yep.
---
It does mean that.
---
Where do you die to Rez in xroads not ratchet?
---
I seriously doubt that. I would put my money on the beta being a 2 week server stress test and also give them a wide range of hardware IDs to see how compatibility is with different components. Also, to be a glorified trial.
---
who cares like there should not be any new models or animations they all either existed in retail or vanilla
---
WTF to all these comments.
---
The Addon API will be a stripped down and modified version of the Retail interface.  Protected Frames and Secure Code still, but many of the functions will be disabled, and a few new ones added (for things like Weapon Skills).
---
It's ok, you're allowed to swear on the internet.
---
And that run to SM on ally is terrible.  Horde can just run like 1 wing at a time, ally seems to always want to do it all in one go because they have that stupid swim while horde just run from UC.
---
Running to IF on my night elf warrior. 
---
Couldn’t figure out what to do once I finished quests in the night elf starting area and I was in a guild with friends I had playing CS 1.6. I was 13 and one of the guildies came to fetch me and guide me to IF. 
---
I had no idea where to go cause the map made the world feel so big. It took us like 2 hours to make it through wetlands. I was hooked from that point on.
---
Best Saturday morning ever spent in WoW
---
This map is from a WoW Atlas I got for Christmas of 2005.  It was the first glimpse into the massive world I was beginning my journey into at the time. I was amazed at how many different paths there were and how, being a NE at the time in Teldrassil, I could get to all the areas of the world. Every page in the book is a different zone with detailed info about mobs and cities. It is still one of my favorite WoW items I own.
---
This
---
It was definitely announced, but I am not sure if it had completely gone through, but I believe it did.  When announced it was brought to us with a lot of positivity and excitement.
---
I view the move as a good one.  Blizzard and Activision in terms of developing games don't have any overlap at all and run independently.  From what I can tell it still remains that way.  What it did allow them to do was ultimately get more control over their product, they were under Vivendi Universal at the time, and Activision was sort of the next step in getting more power, not less.
---
For the most part the culture through out my time stayed the same, but you have to admit, WoW was pretty game changing and it changed Blizzard culture if it intended to or not.  It went from this small company in an office park to huge amounts of customer service employees almost immediately.  Within two years they are so huge they have their own Campus.  
---
All of this was probably already in place by the time I showed up, but WoW really changed everything, even the other game companies around it.
---
Speculating on this is really fun and interesting. I would say the upload does support a July release more than a delay. There havent been any files, as far as I know on the datamined database that has been dormant for more than 2 - 3 months before hitting the [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) Client . Maby... the beta... will be July 16 or maby it is the release. Will be exiting to follow!
---
First trip into ashenvale.
---
Anyone predicting how long they'll run the beta for before we can actually play? I need something else to do with my life besides working, unwinding from work, then sleeping
---
Oh believe me the Swift Zulian Tiger is my primary objective in Classic. It’s my fav mount ingame and I’ve wanted it since before I ever started wow. The bengal tiger is just cool to me kuz its even more unique
---
Surprise! This is the Fallout 76 ticket system. All of your personal details have been sent to everyone in this thread.
---
i assume they want to gague popularity so i hope we get all the servers.
---
sometimes blizz has only a couple servers for wow testing though 
---
really dont want to play on NA ping
---
I don't think anyone really cares about what's in the client that much but 1. You asked, and 2. People are desperate for more info
---
You couldn't pay me to be a gnome
---
I smell like cum and my cat is attracted to me. Is she for peepee?
---
&gt; Nothing you can be asked to do in the game as an individual is remotely difficult, but it's very easy to die if you're not careful.
---
Sounds just like dark souls. If it wasn't onebro wouldn't be a thing.
---
WE'RE TELLING WARCRAFT STORIES!  WHO WAS YOUR FIRST HK, NOT COUNTING LOWBIES?
---
if you're terrible and want to kill lots of people you should play shadow priest, I'm confident with 5 buttons I could kill 80% of a servers population as a shadow priest, you can handle it
---
the most interesting thing i can think is will there be a shop tab for mounts and pets and garbage .
---
any evidence of wow tokens
---
addon/macro functionality
---
Yeah, like any good entertainment media, the value lies in how quickly and efficiently you can communicate the message. 
---
/s
---
Also, you’ve made it clear you’ve no idea what content creation means, be it artistically or legally.
---
I'm stuck between hunter, warlock, and warrior. I want to do the HWL grind and debating what I want to spend that much time on.
---
Yes! sort of, i was only like 10 years old in Vanilla and my parents did not let me play any video games so I would just watch my friend play at his house and occasionally play his sisters warlock in bgs XD.  Watching that game was almost as fun as playing it I swear lol
---
Can confirm. I got placed on that island/ box back in the day
---
Too many drawbacks, its 1.12 vanilla, your windfury procs wont stack over eachother and proc an infinite amount of times. Not worth it, meanwhile I think ele is one of the best pvp specs, its huge damage output is crazy especially with chain lightning.
---
Yes, this is exactly what I am going to do so as to not burn out. Woooo!
---
Is it 1.13 because that's after 1.12, or just a coincidence?
---
No it's not. If it wasn't hard how do you explain all the onebros?
---
Good luck with that Paladin tank.
---
According to an early tweet by one of the data-miners, it's now based off a 8.x.x client
---
Hi, /u/IAmARockDoc
---
Warlock you'll tend to get stuck guarding a point in AB due to the crazy CC you'll bring. 
---
Hunter you'll often get tasked with guarding the WSG flag so that rogues can't sneak it.
---
Warrior you'll be a wrecking ball or flag carrier.
---
"Hunter you remembered to dismiss your pet before we jumped right?
---
"Oh don't worry i have feign death."
---
Just comes across as a bit of a phony
---
Not necessarily.  I was always looking for new ways to keep it fresh, I wanted to do as many different functions of the job as possible.  I think once the option to become a specialist materialized I jumped on that right away.
---
Loved and still love Vanilla. Love playing RP private servers like Arelith on Neverwinter Nights. Would now love to play RP-PVP seriously all the way to 60. Hearing that they aren’t going to have these servers was wicked disappointing, I don’t see why they cannot have at least one. WPVP is too large a part of the vanilla experience to take this 1/4 server type out of the equation.
---
"Buy Adderall" - "Mankrik's wife" - "hey guys tips out here" - pretty much sums up this entire sub.
---
#FROST SHOCK
---
It’s not a question exactly, but I wanted to thank you as a proxy for thanking all GMs. You guys are always super friendly whenever I have an issue, and with one exception that sounded phrased like an outsource on a script, you guys always seem to know what I’m trying to describe. You toss meme references and jokes while waiting for information to load, you’re sympathetic without being unprofessional, and generally very chill. It seems to be the standard across WoW and Overwatch both (not as big a player of the others), and that friendliness and approachable humanity is one of the reasons I will always come back to Blizzard games when finances and internet connectivity allow.  
---
A lot of people don’t realize how much the GMs do, I think; with so many players across so many realms, the ratio is such that most people aren’t aware of everything you guys do for the players. Thanks!
---
but the lamps in westfall man it has to be right
---
There might have been a few monitored words.  If there were I wasn't made aware of what they were.
---
So PvP happened on a PvP server and a GM had to get involved?  Damn.
---
Loot tables etc. are all server side.
---
I would almost think being unsubbed would get you a leg up, since betas these days are half playtest, half advertising.
---
They also make sure that a few people with really old/odd computer specs get invites, just to see how everything runs on them. So still random, but random within that specific pool.
---
The odd thing about this to me—is that an RP-PVP server differs in no way from a regular PVP server...the only difference is that the server type is indicated as RP, so you know what the community is all about. 
---
What this says to me is that Blizz is going a very cheap route with their infrastructure—and as a result there are going to be very few servers in total. If there were several servers ready to go, all they need to do is change the name of one PvP server to RP-PVP. That being said, I hope they aren’t going to give us 2 PVE, 2 PVP and 1 RPPvE server.
---
Why dont you guys just do rp ob a pvp server?
---
Another great episode!
---
I wasn't able to make it on the cast. But I'll echo some of the same sediments that we're shared by the community call. As this episode really brings out the feels. 
---
And also made me wanted to share my journey:
---
I was one of those people who instantly looked for a podcast on Classic right at the announcement. I first found one cast that only lasted 10 episodes and then couldn't find a replacement. Eventually I gave up searching.
---
A few months or so later I finally jumped on Reddit and on the Classic subreddit and see a post for this podcast. I don't remember which episode I first listened to. But it was the perfect podcast for my commute and was exactly the WoW content I was looking for.
---
Even though I was burning through the library of podcasts I never thought to jump on the discord. I knew about discord and heard it was the new vent. But was long done with any games that required it and didn't understand the community around it. Anyways after reaching out to Josh, he said I should jump on discord and check it out as he does his interviews though it. Though I may not be the most active member, I do feel I found a home and community for my Classic adventure. 
---
It is really amazing just how far this podcast and community has come. And seems to only be getting better and stronger the closer we get to launch.
---
A big thanks to Josh and the community! You guys are great and have only enhanced the already huge hype for Classic
---
My friends and me used to rent single player games and take turns watching. It never surprised me that Let's Plays took off like they did; there's something fun about watching a good game being played with fun people.
---
Different words and contexts held different penalties.  I don't wanna get to specific into the exact way it worked, but it the way they explained it in training was it was like filling cups with water.  small offenses gave smaller fills while big offenses filled the cup faster.  Fill a cup take a time out. 
---
In theory you could say 'shit' and 'fuck' with no context enough to real account trouble, which were generally not to big a deal.  Now dealing with more personal matters like race, orientation or religion was hitting more personal space gave a more harsh penalty.  Saying horrific graphic stuff about minors... that type of shit just has no place in the game.  WoW is supposed to be a hate free place, with the exception of the hate you have for the opposing faction, which you should show through valid in game functions!
---
Beyond the midpoint between them, I'd assume. Do the same trick to get to Taurajo a little faster.
---
If by creep you mean arouse, then yes
---
Maybe they conceptualized it being easier, but it is in no way shape or form easier for most people. Maybe if you are on nearly dead server it could be easier, but for most people on average to high population servers you are looking at least 6 weeks of playing 18 hour days to get to rank 14 and thats not even counting the grind to get to rank 13. 
---
Maybe blizzards "conception" of it was that it was going to be easier but they were way off just like many other things they "planned" in vanilla that ended up scrapped or in broken pieces.
---
Naxx is hard for sure, but I wouldn't even put it in the same sentence as the rank 14 grind.
---
If you have a full time job and can dedicate 3-4 hours a day you can find a guild and clear naxx, if you are trying for pvp armor? You might hit rank 10... 
---
over and over we have heard ex wow devs say how every spec was supposed to be viable in raids, and how they were all supposed to have gear sets, but just like that and the pvp system it was all pushed into TBC because of time constraints.
---
I'm assuming that is what they were going for.  Clever I think
---
You could go on allakazam and look at people shit. Even the stuff in inventory. They needed addon I think. Or a 3rd party program. Fuzzy on that
---
The devs have officially dubbed the first classic release as 1.13, the obvious successor of 1.12.
---
g, war, p, little power
---
By the time vanilla was done we had more eyes than we knew what to do with.
---
That said, we went 4 months without one once
---
Orc warrior pvp server. Going back to stance dance and I'm fucking stoked about it!
---
I got BFA beta twice, originally on a random trial account which hilariously didn't allow me to make or play on a character above 20 on the beta, wrote a ticket and got beta on my real account. So nah you don't need an active sub.
---
I had a GM do a similar thing for us during a raid in Black Temple. (Lower your volume if on headphones)
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYuZXaMGNWg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYuZXaMGNWg)
---
Doesn't matter if Legion had an open beta. They launched it, it crashed because their population tripled, then they fixed it.
---
This thread should really be broken up to pvp or pve.  
---
And I presume what you mean is the class with the highest skill cap.  And want to be actually viable.  Feral DPS is a hella tough spec with an insane skill cap, but even when performed optimally, it is just so niche that only 2 should really be brought on alliance raids.  If you want BiS pre-AQ, you will need to push rank 12 in pvp.  If you aren't a purest and don't plan to put in the man hours to perfect and optimize, you will not be an asset.
---
Rogue honestly would be my pick just because they have great dps, and a high skill cap in pvp.
---
Mage raiding for the first year you will either cast frostbolt on repeat, or cast decurse on repeat.  But pvp is a blast when you learn some nuances.
---
Profanity filter wasn't an excuse for it,  but at the same time not every channel was equally actionable.
---
if you were shouting 'fuck' in the Barrens, highly likely you getting reported.  On the other hand if you say 'fuck' in say cause you accidentally pulled to many mobs in an instance, there is a good chance a GM wouldn't even see that, and there is a chance they may let it slide if they did.
---
I never bothered with those quests. I would just group up and grind low level beasts while playing "live to win" on loop.
---
I mean, I can't wait for this, and I hope it's early summer.  I want to be sitting here, windows open at night for a nice cross breeze through my gaming room while my wife and kid sleeps on the other side of the upstairs.  Sitting in my super-light boxer briefs and soft tank top, with some Dogfish Head Sea Quench in glass in my hand.  It's going to be glorious.
---
They seemed pretty smart since they had little huts, too.
---
Hope it's like that.
---
I know you’re desperate for the beta, but it isn’t going to be an open one. There’s no need to grasp at straws and get your hopes up; they’ll do an invite beta like they always do.
---
Ooooooouu
---
Ok, he said drown so I thought there might be a special spot.
---
I can only imagine he means drowning in the lake with the centaurs? I still feel like that would be closer to Ratchet.
---
Leads were the highest tier GMs and if I recall correctly show in game as Lead GM.
---
There is a higher customer service tier yet, but us GMs mostly dealt with our Seniors and Leads.
---
I remember seeing one of these!!! It was before I ever played the game. I got to the page on Ashenvale, and that was it. I needed to play after that.
---
wait for classic the gamers arent comparable in any way aside from sharing the same name
---
No, its not even remotely close to being the same.  By your reasoning [this!](https://youtu.be/zmyDrJJaLoo?t=497)  is easy as long as you're careful.  Even when you know what to do in Dark Souls, actual execution can still be difficult.
---
Silvers from bags adds up quickly
---
Yeah but you'd get murdered before you got close to the lake
---
I don't trust this garbage can of a community, the vanilla community is filled with fake fans and annoying people. They want everything made specially for them even tho they never played a day of real vanilla in their life. Beta should be closed and if you get lucky access, then well, you are lucky. Just because you don't want to test your luck like the rest of us have for every xpac for the past 15 years, then don't play and uninstall [battle.net](https://battle.net). Things will and wont be specially molded for you cry babies, closed beta for a medium sized stress test and a smooth quality beta timeframe.
---
They might have done, but time invested into a character was only half the equation, and the much simpler half at that. Friends and connections made in the local server community you'd been part of for several months at that point... that's a less tangible but no less significant factor, and one much more difficult to give up and move away from.
---
Which is, again, why I so strongly believe waiting to roll out an RPvP realm in Classic will be a mistake.
---
It's entirely possible I'm mistaken in that belief, that Ion has the right of it and we truly are a small niche community. I obviously don't believe that to be the case, but I'm willing to accept I may be wrong. Unless we get at least one RPvP realm in each region at launch, however, we'll never truly know.
---
I have no intention of playing the beta, I have waited 10+ years and will wait until the full launch. I'm just saying its pretty silly to claim it wouldn't be open. Server count make or breaks Classic on day 1.

Emerald Dream was the shit back in the day. I played on ED as a rogue/mage (Username: Dual) from 2006-2012. There was a ton of culture and community on the realm and some dedicated RP'ers that would literally never break character, while most would just spectate rather than participate. They had guild rivalries, volunteer run RP events, and tons of realm drama (the good kind). The realm forums were extremely active and most people who posted knew each other. If you were a fervent world pvp'er expect to see an @post on the forums directed at you or your guild/friends at the end of every night calling you a scoundrel or scum. In fact, some people were passionate enough about the faction-pvp that they would put out bounties on opposing factions. There were many famous names on the realm known for different things and there was in fact a realm-wide meme know as "***The List***" started by this dingus named Tundros who used some Bollywood dub-subtitle meme-generator who gave shout-outs to the dramatis personae on the realm and it soon became the highest honor of the realm to be on it.  Even if you weren't well known your reputation still meant a lot, and I don't mean *madL33tpvPSkillz* but your character as a person. I was 12 in 2006 but I  was an avid pvp'er and all around shit-head. The time I felt the most honored is when I found out that people were sending out alerts in /1 when I would be spotted in certain zones because I was known for being a grief'er &lt;3. It really felt alive as far as a server went and even had a decent end-game guilds and pvp scene.   
---
Some of the most fun-times were when it wasn't really about game content anymore but other players or guilds. There was a sense of pride in the faction and every RP event eventually devolved into a PVP event. There was always something going on that was independent of PvE because the players would make shit happen instead of waiting for the next release or world event.

Fantomspower, thanks so much for the touching summary mate, it really has become a great big family. I’ll post this one in the discord too :)

/r/technicallythetruth

exactly my thoughts
---
MO the streamers aren't the problem, it's the hordes of teenagers who follow them who are a pain in the ass. I don't want to be on server full of kids spamming *omagalul* for hours on end.
---
I honestly think people want it to be open just so they can play and try it out
---
NE Hunter, PVE server. I barely have any free time, so i don't want to spend it getting ganked
---
It sounds like you’ve spent too much time in the private server scene.
---
Some people would pay good money to get to experience classic as a total know nothing noob again.
---
You joking right?  It's more like 11hour 24minutes but takes 24-48 hours.

The first day of Summer! 6/21/19
---
The Summer Solstice is Friday, June 21, 2019 at 3:54 PM GMT (9:54 AM Pacific Time) to be exact.
---
Seeing as you're a time traveler I assume this question is for your future self.
---
Generally it was all positive and I enjoyed it a lot.  they encourage everyone to treat each other respectfully and collaborate.  Lots of GMs decorate their work space with gaming memorabilia they enjoy.  There is tons of it all over the place in the buildings.  The swag is absolutely amazing, and the break room is absolutely epic.  
---
For the most part I always handled the workload really well and generally didn't take issue with it.  You do get tired sometimes and have ups and downs, but for the most part it's fine.
---
What server did you play on, I had the exact same experience in my guild back on Barthilas.
---
I wouldn't exactly say didn't care, but we didn't want to punish you for wanting to explore.
---
If it didn't ultimately harm the balance of the game you could get away with 1 or 2 of those no problem.
---
You HAVE to hit that dank Execute, there's no real option here
---
I swear the spulcher was connected to tarren mill.
---
Not sure how anything I've said indicates that but nope, haven't played in 10 years.
---
Weirdest person you had to deal with?
---
I'm putting my chips down on beta weekends. Kinda like Overwatch did.
---
I don't think they could find people who could afford to live in Southern California for that little, but if I recall correctly minimum wage at the time was around $7.25.
---
Blizzard really took care good of it's employees for the most part.
---
Are you actually retarded?
---
Doesnt reforged release in December?
---
Damn I only play gnomes cause I think all other races are ugly ;)
---
Prot paladin was so fun in TBC. Good memories
---
Haha, I was a huge currency seller in EQ and FFXI, I was smart to go straight and narrow and get on the good guys team for WoW!  ;)
---
&gt; I played on one in Vanilla. Twin Emps never died. I don’t think any end wing bosses in Naxx died. Those all had server firsts in TBC.
---
...and?
---
I also played during Vanilla, and one of the best things about the game back then was raiding wasn't the Be All and End All. It was simply one more thing to do for those as enjoyed that kind of challenge.
---
And that's great if that's your thing, don't get me wrong. But I fail to see how the presence or absence of strong raiding progression is in any way relevant to the health of the community on the server. Especially on a *PvP* server.
---
its a mmo there needs to be a beta so bugs can be found and hopefully exploits fixed
---
i know bliz normally has fake beta's but with wow im fine with it due to the mmo nature
---
I think it would be cool is at a random point in time they changed it from not working outside the instance to full plague and let it go for 12 hours or something.
---
Your last comment is exactly the type of garbage people in the private scene parrot over and over despite having no truth to it.
---
A tiny bit in training.  for the most part though when you were in GM mode you were helping you guys play.  To many people to help to mess around to much!
---
90+% of beta users provide no feedback. 5% provide useless feedback, 3% provide good feedback but on things that can't be changed, 2% find and provide feedback on fixable issues.
---
I don't know if I can spend 18 hours a day looking at a flag.
---
Oh my god I can't wait to go through Classic Elwynn Forest with a Night Elf!
---
Probably gonna swim though and skip running through the Wetlands this time lol
---
It's been a while sins I played but in wpvp or av you do pretty good unless you get kitted if you do use LoS and ghost wolf and run away. In wsg or ab you have to play carefully use your defensive totems, interrupts and purge, jump on ppl whit low hp. You are better at the beginning of server life then in the end. Better gear won't make you that much better and more hp on the other side will hurt you. You will have problems arguing your spot in pre made but you are pretty good at protecting flag runner (earthbound, grounding and frost shock) and you have same speed as flag runner in ghost wolf. Still it is one of the worst group pvp specs out there
---
For live I am okay with it but this is a different type of beta. We are talking about what is going to be a short development cycle even if they release at the end of summer. Fake bug reports of people who don't know what they are talking about will be a huge issue with a beta to big. They most likely don't have a master game doc to say yes or no and will have to take every bug and compare it against their 1.12 they have running in the office. The team is small and having to do this will eat into resources
---
The orcs who invaded where under control of the burning legion modern orcs are not (well not more than any other race).
---
Did you accept/encourage behavior that wasn't allowed in the ToS/ game etiquette as a GM? 
---
Thanks for doing this AMA.
---
There's a good handful of them that literally slow down their videos to stretch them out. Just enough so it's hardly noticeable. You can watch them on 1.25 speed and they STILL sound like they're talking slowly.
---
Your main problem is elemental have all of your extra stuff and do more burst from a safer distance can do really nice heals and scale wery well whit gear
---
No, all mounts are soulbound as soon as you acquire them.
---
&gt; mage is not competitive in pve for a loong time until aq patch. 
---
This statement doesn't make any sense.
---
Mages are strictly DPS and always do more DPS than a similarly geared &amp; skilled priest or druid throughout all of Classic. A very skilled Feral Druid stacking consumables and Manual Crowd Pummelers and powershifting with the correct gear such as Wolfshead Helm might get to the point of out-DPSing a comparable Mage, but that's an extreme edge case.
---
&gt; priest is the most competitive in pve 
---
"most competitive" in what context? Even for healing, priests are the most versatile healing class but not the best in particular categories - Paladins put out more heals per second and Druids have more cost effective healing (with +heal gear &amp; R4 Healing Touch spam). 
---
&gt; druid is also top at being the hardest to get a raid spot. 
---
The consensus is that often times guilds scramble to even get more than one or two geared &amp; raid-capable Druids in their raids. Raids need Mark/Gift of the Wild, and thus would take ANY Druid regardless of spec &amp; skill at this point, so long as they are reliable. As far as slot competition, no raid refuses skilled &amp; reliable characters even if they don't perform as well as "optimized" specs. Finally, Druids have little loot competition as well, where Feral Druids gear up differently than Rogues (strength is good)  and Resto Druids are the only class that natively use caster leather gear.
---
There is nothing more desperate than those Classic Vanilla YouTubers who make 100th video about "top 10 most OP ability in vanilla!!!" or "10 things that were different in vanilla!".
---
I had a lot of fun but do yourself a favor and spec Elem/Enhance with emphasis on the Elemental part (31/20). I didn't do much AB or WSG, but in AV I spent most of my time spamming Chain Lightning/Lightning Bolt  and using my Elemental Mastery as much as possible. Also, a fair amount of time using Earth Shock for interrupts and some frost shock to keep the enemy from fleeing and helping my fellow Hordies slaughter the Alliance Scum. Windfury procs were fun, especially when I got The Unstoppable Force. They didn't happen often but when they did, it was very satisfying. Nothing felt greater then a 3 hit combo, frost shock and a guaranteed crit lightning spell burst.
---
I’ll take some beta.
---
Bah. Accidentally posted my reply before it was complete. Trying again.
---
&gt;Leveling was really quiet. I eventually was forced to join a leveling guild because zones were kinda just dead. In Vanilla. Non RP-PVP servers were substantially busier.
---
They'd also been around since launch. RPvP realms weren't rolled out until 1.8, nearly a year later. Sure, a lot of people made the jump, but I'd bet a whole lot more decided it wasn't worth sacrificing the character levels and connections they'd made on their original servers.
---
I'm willing to accept I could be mistaken here. It's entirely possible Ion's right and we really are a small niche community. I don't believe that to be the case (to the contrary, I think Ion and the folks at Blizzard will be blown away by how popular a choice it is), but I could well be wrong on that count. Wouldn't be the first time, and if it pans out that way I'll come back here, make a post linking to all the times I declared it'd be a hit, eat my crow and shut up about it forevermore.
---
Thing is, the only way to really know is to have it available as an option *at launch.* Otherwise they're simply repeating the selfsame mistake that kneecapped the potential popularity of RPvP and led to its being viewed as such a niche interest in the first place.
---
GIEEEV. ACCEEEESSS!!!!!
---
This has to be a short beta right? Why do we need a beta for a game released in 2004? Stress test for the battle.net integration?
---
Not really man. Plenty of realms back in the day and currently (region dependant) referred to The Deadmines as DM and simply connected the specific wing of Dire Maul to its acronym. DMN for example meaning Dire Maul North. There's a bunch of other little differences aswell, worst case scenario shift clicking a characters name in chat will give you that characters level and location so it's pretty simple to work it out if there is any ambiguity.
---
Absolutely insane!
---
Wow... this makes so much sense. I actually miss the old community (the one that died as WoTLK came to a close...), and I always secretly suspected GM's like the ones described here had a huge role in shaping that environment.
---
Which do you prefer, castles or mud huts ?
---
DAMMIT, BONNIE!! You lied about the poop sack!
---
That's what made vanilla great. Every class felt like they had something good to offer
---
Could you see everything a player had done. Once I recovered an item from a quest, how did the gm view I completed said quest and what other character or account info could you see?
---
This and addon/macro testing want my UI ready to rock day one.
---
So fitting for the vanilla time period
---

DWAYNE JOHNSON
---
Yeah absolutely. Reliablity is a big thing for me. I know tons of people wpuld have ever flpwong salt if we gave it to someone and they just never logged back in.
---
I'd say consider the pet AI. If you can be bothered to deal with the pet's pathfinding and managing your pet, go hunter, it's better to be at range for both pve and pvp (unlike retail, which has been world of meleecraft since cata). If you find a guild, raid spots are a non-issue, as comps generally don't follow exact templates, you can bring 5 hunters, 2 shadow priests and 3 ret paladins and still do any boss.  
---
Rogues have better dps in pve, yes, but there's so damn many of them and they don't bring anything else except damage, and even that is lower than a fury warrior's.
---
Thanks! 
---
Like I said, we'll be playing viable toons eventually. No sense min/maxing before thoroughly enjoying the game. It's not going anywhere this time. We have all the time in the world to reroll and respec.
---
I dont think its random.  I've participated in almost every single blizz beta in the last 10 years just by being active in the betas.  Report anything and everything that's not intended, dont be a dick, actually test and dont be there to just fly through content and you'll get invited to the next.  I dont even play sc2 but I logged on that whack game to test!
---
If guild leaders are forcing upgrades and reserving items, then they are just doing loot council with extra steps. So you basically just described all the different ways loot council is terrible.
---
Just stopped in to comment, hunters are the best World PvP class.
---
I will definitely be playing classic!  I can't wait!

Saved! Can tell you from personal experience that Ungoro is NOT for lvl 48s tho lol.  It's really hard at 50.  The first quest people usually do is the diametradons and they are level 54-55.  I'd change that to minimum lvl 52.
---
Appreciate the clarification on my post @Ebby89 thank you.
---
Why do Warriors make such horrible vendors?
---
They charge too much!
---
Damn, I’d forgotten about those, haha
---
Literally every piece of factual data shows them to be niche. From polls conducted here to actual server populations. 
---
Until they took them away literally no one cared.
---
As is the only things separating RP-PvP servers from a PvP server are policies that Blizzard doesn’t even enforce. 
---
There’s no potential popularity being kneecapped. It’s a niche activity. They have the server population stats to back that decision up.
---
I joined alliance because my friends already rolled that way. Probably would have went horde if I had the choice. 
---
Rolling alliance this time for the major cities and faction mounts.
---
Absolutely!  Very boring though!  Just a bunch of GM avatars standing around.
---
The one time I used it's functionality I can think of was to check some cross faction trash talk.  I spoke to myself between horde and alliance characters on GM island to determine what was being said, since the chat log shows whatever was actually typed and not the translation.  Aside from that it was mostly just a place so you could not be seen.
---
I played a priest back in retail vanilla and have been in healing rolls on pservers as well. I can honestly say this isn't my experience at all, part of the job as a healer is rezing your buds. If wiping to a boss gives the chance for the tank to take a break and do whatever for a minute it's really not that big of a deal. If somebody is taking the piss then there are better ways of seeking vengeance, like breaking all their gear by letting them die, that's always a good one.
---
If you have no intention of playing the beta how do you know others don't feel the same? How will Blizz be able to gauge how many servers to run if people will choose not to play the beta? You're assuming an open beta will be an accurate depiction of the final population, which is obviously not true.
---
lol no.
---
They instantly figured out doors in Jurassic Park, so it makes sense

Ugh Thousand Needles sans water 😍

Somebody get me a beta invite and I’ll make some mods. Would be so much fun
---
relative to the number of tickets we take?  almost never.
---
Most cases of a GM showing themselves were Lead GMs.  Wasn't always the case and you could occasionally show yourself, particularly if you were already using your in game character and had spent some time helping someone, you might have decided to show.  Generally though there is always someone to help, so you didn't always have time to do that.
---
this post aged ok
---
Would you rather fake bug reports, or a smaller population and people not finding bugs? 
---
I'd rather all bugs be reported plus fake ones, instead of missing some that make it into live.
---
heya! I was on the High Warlord grind, but stopped at warlord. Played a Troll enhance. 
---
 I found it to be the best PvP class in terms of fun. There was a bit of random element to it (which I enjoy) and if you had your keybindings set up properly, there wasn't a situation you were not prepared for. 
---
 the downside was doing PvE, no one wanted you in a group =p

There is no classic wow currently available to live stream.
---
Wow. I've never thought about this before.
---
My minds telling me no. But my body...
---
Talking to multiple players at once.  I could spin 4 conversations effectively, probably from all my AIM days as a kid!  But especially when I first started we basically would get to work and go into a ticket frenzy.  The queues were like 4 days long at that point so it literally felt like taking single grains of sand from the beach.
---
The main reason to follow someone is if they were exploiting something and you wanted to catch them in the act.  If you can't prove it you can't take someone out of the game, but if someones found something they don't think anyone knows about they usually will do whatever it is pretty quickly and you can figure out what the situations warrants from there.
---
This was also how we handled bots.  The bots back then looked so terrible is was obvious.  Most of them had an auto logout function if a GM sent them a message too, so that did no good.  It was easier to verify and get them out and move on.
---
...I got ported out with a stern warning once. Was worth it, though =)
---
Was GM Island real?
---
for a second I didn't get where this picture was taken from and it looked like notre-dame dude
---
10 minutes is basically the gold standard when it comes to monetisation, I'm not sure if it caps at 10 minutes but if you can stretch a video to be that long you make a lot more than if it was 9 minutes long
---
&gt; I would strongly recommend looking at mages through the lens of single  target / group leveling rather than leveling one up on a top heavy  server. 
---
Very true, but even at this task Mages are going to put out consistently higher single target DPS and do it in a much more mana-efficient manner: Priests have to blow a lot more mana (Mind Blast is REALLY expensive) to even try to keep up with the single target DPS of a mage spamming Frostbolt, which means that the "zero downtime" of a Spirit Tap / Wand Spec Priest becomes "non-zero downtime" which is a world that the Mage wins handily at, with it's free water and constant CC that enables proper kiting. In addition, due to being much better at kiting, Mages are much better at soloing quest elites than Priests are (so long as said elites are melee &amp; CC'able, which most are).
---
To be fair, Priests can heal and thus have a lot more options and are very enjoyable in "group leveling" scenarios such as quest runs in dungeons, but Mages aren't slouches in this regard even so. Mages are probably the most sought-after DPS for 5 man dungeons, where they bring amazing group utility in Polymorph, milk &amp; cookies, the best AoE DPS, all the while being a ranged DPS class which means that they have a safer and more reliable time putting out their DPS in a typical 5 man dungeon environment
---
Cheers

1. It would not require an overhaul for the modern system to do this with modification. It would require an overhaul at some point to make the modern system if you had the older more primitive wow servers. 
---
that is to say, the new system can emulate the behaviour of the old server, but by nature of the realm being contiguous and isolated it cannot be nearly as efficient as the current retail system, because the current retail system is designed for server efficiency by exploiting many optimizations that can be made with a strict server-wide sharding system (which is a big reason why most modern MMOs have sharding. Efficient servers are cheap servers.) 
---
2. The reason increasing the cap might not work, is because if they only intend to shard the starting zones, Then they aren't fixing the problem only delaying it. Lets say they shard to level 20 zones. If we were to distribute the amount of time every player takes to level, I'm sure we would end up with a bell curve with the majority of players would begin to start flooding the lvl 20 zones generally around the same time. Your playerbase has spread out, which is what you want. But by increasing the player count, when the majority of players show up in the lvl 20 you will have the exact same problem as if you didnt have sharding at launch, if maybe only slightly mitigated.
---
 Because we don't know how long the "tourist effect" will happen, what the average time to level 20 is on actual 1.12 (private server info is not accurate) is unknown, and how many people can be expected to leave, I think blizzard is hesitant for that approach because there are a lot of unknowns. Personally, I think this is a better approach than sharding in general, and deal with server population imbalance with free high to low server transfers. (though that comes with its own logistical problems)
---
3. Im sure the devs have accepted the server chugging. When u end up with multiple 40 man raids fighting over a world boss, its going to chug. its inevitable.  They're trying to avoid hard crashes. Hard crashes could lead to rollbacks, which leads to GM tickets of lost items, and people unhappy that they can't play, and customer support costs money. Also if it just hard crashes multiple times, some people will just leave and never come back. Players are fickle.
---
4. basically, you're correct and making individual servers a smoke screen is what they're doing already. And "dynamic server flexing" is one of those big improvements to server tech. But, it has its limits.
---
Almost no server is a single physical server anymore. Classic servers will have to be a single isolated "logical" server though. (except for the continent session split, instances, BGs, login/authentication servers, chat servers, etc) Otherwise, you have cross-realm stuff going on. (or even worse a classic client connecting to a retail session by accident and u end up running a dungeon with BFA players, which is in theory possible because they're the same client version.) You've generally got multiple servers working as a single logical server by sharing info. This is a load balanced system, and theres multiple ways to do it. Depends on case, but im sure retail servers can balance the load of a single realm over multiple physical server by placing different shards on different physical servers, since they dont really need to send realtime info between shards. You cant do this as much when there are no shards because you'd introduce a lot of latency into the system just trying to pass basic combat info back and forth. Basically everybody that can see and interact with each other should be on a single server "session" which is why you get much worse lag when a lot of people are in one place. instead of being able to balance the load, all the load ends up on one machine.
---
And what group is out there that knows the new coding and system they used? Other than the guys who build Classic? 
---
 Attrition works. Throw enough bodies at it and people will stumble onto bugs.

Ah the memories of those mammaries.

Feels like you're talking about tbc now there won't be any spirit wolves. And playing aggressive only works in wpvp and av, where it works really well. In pre made wsg or ab you need to work whit your team and that normally means playing a bit more passive.

---
It's the cutoff for midroll ads on your video. Also YouTube prioritises videos over that length in the recommended feed because apparently they're "better" content, so the content creators just abuse it and spew out garbage to get over the threshold.
---
Good points, but I try to mitigate when anyone says something akin to:
---
&gt; druids excel at flagcarry role in wsg, and don't excel in anything else. (ok they are also the best 5man tank) 
---
You'll want to read [https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/). In the \~14 years since Vanilla came out, the community has realized that Feral Druids are actually the best off-tanks throughout Vanilla, and in certain circumstances (particularly when single target threat is holding the raid back) can be the best choice of even a main tank for a raid!
---
Not anymore
---
You can play Ele or Enhc shaman and keep int gear for raid healing. That way you can farm and heal.
---
If you die its always the healers fault so go for it.
---
I know. I have about 300days/played of vanilla as fury warrior, both from retail vanilla and on private servers.
---
Which isn't saying much for a gnome.
---
I might be getting some of tbc mixxed up from Vanilla. 
---
 If we are talking premade, then any class works. Since it's more about moving together and overwhelming people. Even in the PvP farm team I was in, I never went defensive, you're a class that has insane burst damage and you can kill faster then most classes if the RNG is on your side, seems strange to holster that much power, for what? If you want to play defensively then roll resto or elemental. Otherwise get in there and swing the slowest two-handed hammer into as many faces as you can find.
---
All the content creators just creamed their pants. Now they just have to figure out how to stretch it out to a 10 minute video!

Thank you very much!  I really didn't expect there to be this much interest at all!  The support from reddit and the moderating team has been amazing and I have had a great time reminiscing about classic WoW.  I can't wait!
---
Maybe I was lucky then, I only had a handful of bad pugs. I was in a high end raiding guild and felt players had more skill. 
---
 Yes it was a bigger time sink, but then the sense of achievement was better, players didn’t get epics handed to them on a plate. 
---
I’m looking forward to that, most of all.
---
I don’t understand the hype. It was pretty obvious they were going to have a beta. It doesn’t really show how close we are to an actual release neither.
---
Still waiting for a blue post giving us the actual release date.
---
I'm not saying Blizz should start selling Classic Collector's editions with beta keys, but they definitely should...
---
I thought the phrase *Tasting Raptor Horn* meant something else...
---
Call Center.  It was a full time 40 hour a week job and a very professional, albeit fun with high levels of gamer pride, environment.  During my time there we actually relocated twice and there was a splintering to a call center in Austin as well.  WoW was growing faster than we could find places to put people!
---
PvE frost mage. Intense frostbolt casting
---
Archimonde sure let it rip all over Hyjal when he died... No wonder they quarantined it off.

Troll shammy or Tauren hunter on RP PVE server.

Meme spec for paladin is ret. 'Paladin tanks' literally cannot hold aggro in dungeons, especially while levelling up, not to mention they have no taunt. At 60, even in the right gear they can only semi-decently tank instances with undead (strat or scholo). Plus druid healers generate much more threat than others, so this combination will fail badly. Sorry I get you're trying to be all cool and go against the grain but yeah...
---
I didn't meet an alliance player until 5 years after I started playing WoW. I was under the impression that everyone played horde and we collectively thought alliance was dumb. Why would you want to play a human if you're already a human IRL, right?
---
Sweet. We are getting version 1.13

April 19th, 2019: The fan's motor is gummed up with shit
---
This map makes me want Twizzlers... I hope you are happy!
---
Generally speaking players are pretty unhappy when they get banned.
---
The funniest situations from the GMs perspective is when someone gets really upset at someone else and reports them...  Only to find out they are the only ones who violated the policy.  If it's not to bad you let it go, but sometimes it's kinda bad and they end up reporting someone but they were the ones who took the ban hammer cause they were in fact the ones who said it.
---
Not likely
---
If you care about being ahead of the pack why not just continue leveling and get your first wand from a quest reward or vendor? Spending time grinding out a lesser magic wand won't be worth it.

UPVOTE IF YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT FACTION YOU ARE PLAYING
---
YOU SHALL NOT PASS
---
I think playing with higher-level players may have colored your perception, yeah. I remember some reaally bad players. Then again, I can remember terrible raiders all through TBC...and Wrath as well...maybe that never changed.
---
In any case I'm definitely not opposed to going back to the old ways of gear being exciting rather than just stats. Hopefully, anyway. It could be that's it me that's changed more than the game and it won't feel the same. I guess we'll see.
---
&gt; Just don't expect to best other classes that also came prepared. 
---
PvP isn't just 1v1 duels, and Druids would probably outlast a Mage in a 1v1 duel anyway. Druids never "stomp" in any context though, and if killing is your objective Mage is always better. That said, Druids are uncontested in flag running in WSG, are excellent flag defenders in AB, and Druids are always extremely hard to take down while being mobile which makes them excellent roaming battleground heal-turrets
---
But yeah, a *stationary* Priest is going to put out more heals than a Druid while having more tools to do it. This said, PvP isn't stationary and PvP isn't as clear cut as "who has more DPS / HPS"
---
Hillsbrad foot hills or red ridge mountains.
---
I’d go shammy resto. If you Are going to pvp with your friends, and they are good players, they’ll love a healer, and you mop up the honor being close to them when they kill others.
---
It means a beta is coming in the very near future
---
December 2004
---
I've said this ever since the demo only to have people shouting me down saying it'll be based on 7.3.5.
---
You'd have to be a special kind of moron if you didn't expect them to keep the two clients in sync. 
---
Essentially they'll be using the same client but most likely with different executables and subfolders (_retail and _classic) so you can have separate addons for the two. 
---
I'd be very surprised if they share a client completely and it's just a tab in the realm selector but it's definitely a possibility, the addon situation would turn in to a huge mess though.
---
Listen, my semester ends next week... if they release it... between next week &amp; July, I’ll have enough time to have my 60... it’s all I’m asking for... just... a break...
---
It's only meme specs in raids. Paladins and druids are great in 5-10man content!
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhh
---
I really want to PvP but at the same time I have at most 2-3 hours a day to play. I think I’m going to have to give in and go he PvE route.
---
Orc warlock, pvp server, because ganking and being ganked make the world a dangerous place.
---
😍😍😍
---
I haven't seen a single episode. I'm waiting until the series finale, then I'm going to binge watch all of it marathon style. It might be glorious? I have no clue if it's overhyped. So.. many... memes. Will suddenly make sense.
---
It isn't about knowing the coding. It is about knowing the game. The algorithm that says this hits for 5 now and  hit for 7 then doesn't have to be known to the gamer. Just that it is off
---
For me I already sub to the normal, so it isn’t really costing me anything.
---
HAH
---
Installation and patching
---
I see! I agree then. If it has no stats, a rogue or warrior has virtually 0 use for a ranged weapon
---
Well the beta will definitely work like that. The final product though could be fully integrated into the regular client but I think that's unlikely especially since they recently made a change to the client where there's a subfolder called _retail that contains the executable, addons, settings and a few other things.
---
Most likely they'll pull assets from a shared repository and have a small folder containing classic specific stuff.
---
It's only meme specs in raids. Dps/tank Paladins and druids are great in 5-10 dungeons.
---
I hijacked your car after you got home to drive to the nearest Best Buy to hijack their store to get to their electronics department to log onto one of their computers to hijack this post while I hijack their awful internet to check my gmail just to make sure my Beta invite hasn't been sent yet.
---
30 is low for STV to be a griefer, I would suggest around 40. And rogue of course.
---
I'll play the beta with the same race/class, that I did back then, just for nostalgia.
---
Then, on release, I'll play the one I played when it released.
---
Simple enough.
---
They're not going to disable such a great improvement. Classic and Retail will share the same client from now on. Any update they make to the engine for example will be utilized in both versions of the game.
---
So the boat from Ratchet to Booty Bay went between Zandalar and Pandaria and none of the sailors or captains ever saw them? Such low level sea men haha
---
Most of the people leveling that fast will never step into a dungeon.  But a few of us like to get all the quests and run through the dungeon.
---
It's a break from the grind and usually gets you a decent item or so.  Plus the additional exp prevents you from being forced to grind at a few various points.
---
Honestly it’s the most fun class ever for PVP at 49. You hit like an absolute truck and you’ve got heals to sustain yourself.  
---
However, at 60 you’re just a gimped warrior with spells.
---
For the information sources to use wow head has always been good!
---
Allow me to make a quick list of what should go well with your app!
---
1. First and foremost, add a search bar that will search up anything (from spells to items, etc) make sure the search bar suggests what the user might be typing. 
---
Like if I were to just type in "Potion" without pressing enter, it should suggest a different type of items with the name "potion" as it tries to narrow down what i am searching for.
---
2. In your world map be sure to add the toggled option to show the level ranges for each zone.
---
3. List the uses an item may have. like if i searched copper ore, it should show what i can make with it.
---
4. show drops rates!
---
5. In the talent calculator, show the abilities that the class earns on every level general and specs. just how WoWhead shows all the abilities the class gets in their talent calculator on the side.
---
6. maybe add a type of calculator that determines your potential damage output in different combinations of gear. (shows p.dmg, m.dmg, dodge, crit chance, etc).
---
7. please dont add ads, however, ONLY if you must, please dont make the ads pop up unsolicited and make us wait for 5-30 seconds to use the app again, or dont make the banners so big.
---
8. Maybe allow us to find players through the app along with a 3d model. also guilds if possible.
---
9. maybe the realm's population or a percentage of classes that are actively played within 1 week, 2 weeks, or since creation along with the population of a realm, if possible. 
---
10. Also, if possible, allow us to know how much of an item has been farmed in a realm. Like if someone wants to know how many people has found a recipe of potion swiftness, they would see "168 has been looted". Honestly i doubt it would be possible to get that data at all but if possible that would be a great tool!
---
Thats all i have in mind but I wish you the best of luck and hope you found my suggestions remotely useful.
---
Nåpe
---
Imagine us who actually played Vanilla
---
You're paying $15 a month for Classic AND BfA. If it's not worth 15 bucks to you, don't play it, I don't care.
---
Item restoration were by far the most time consuming, but not for the GM, they were time consuming for the specialist.
---
Harassment issues were really common and could be time consuming.  The thing I didn't like about them is the players were generally unhappy cause some other player did something to them they felt needed to be reported.  There really wasn't much to say, I couldn't tell you what was gonna happen as that would be a total  violation the other persons privacy, and it was a lot of searching to verify what was reported was in fact what was said and then properly noting everything.  Very little customer interaction and lots of documentation on those.
---
I'm not really sure what I'd want to test. I mean I care about the state of the final product but at the same time I don't want to spoil the experience.
---
ive always liked this video of a GM having some fun while helping the players
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arwS7fMCq28
---
im assuming this sort of thing was generally frowned upon? i can understand blizzard not wanting GM's to feel its ok to screw around even if its just innocent fun.
---
Very common. I had it on one of my alts. If I remember correctly there was a 100% chance of the chest containing either the hunter item or the priest item.
---
k
---
You know what. I totally forgot about that. That makes the price more worth it. However for me I have only bought up to mop, and I'm unwilling to buy any more retail wow because I hate what the game has become. I wonder if they would consider any alternative funding to only buy classic wow because I really don't care at all about retail.
---

&gt; don't need it for running costs
---
Go ahead and post your accounting breakdown of what their Classic server load will cost. Don't forget the possible recurring cost of colo. Make sure you've including growth plans for increasing player count. 
---
&gt; no new development
---
We don't really know that yet.
---
&gt; I would consider donating
---
So nice of you to "think about it". Most people never would. Businesses don't run on hopes and dreams, sorry.
---
&gt; If you're in a dungeon you really should just be tanking as a druid anyway
---
This isn't to say that Druids are bad at dungeon healing, though. They might not have a standard res but they get the job done very well

Hope he plays on a PvP server.
---
There is a tiny amount of streamers compared to the regular players who will get in, and the big streamers and content creators get passes so that everyone who can't play the beta still get to see what it looks like. Calm down.
---
8.x? Thought it'd be on the Legion API.
---
Like others said, the subscription is not just for classic. It’s for all of wow. Like others main characters will be on other servers, which you have access to at any time. 
---
For me, I was a raider up until Cat, when I stopped. It became too easy to get epics and things were handed to you.
---
I’m looking forward to classic wow as the cap will be 60 and you can work on character upgrades at all levels. There is a more epic feel to it. Getting the epic mount was a huge deal. First purple was awesome. 
---
Well worth me coming out of gaming hibernation to start paying the subscription once  again.
---
Nah, One less noob.

Still work in the gaming industry or branched out?

It isnt an entirely newly developed game, so there is no need for a lenghy beta.

---
&gt;	Change my mind
---
You’ve made the mistake of believing I care whatsoever
---
So how is it that any multiplayer game these days are able to run servers at the cost of the origional game but WoW is one of the few games that still asks for a monthly fee. You don't pay for maintenance costs you pay for development. If server costs were actually a problem you wouldn't see the profit margin as high as it is. 
---
Also I think you really underestimate the community. We're here only today because of the community willing to donate money for classic wow. That's how all of these private servers came to be.
---
Phobiiaa, your comment ID had a Happy Number in it!
---
 The Happy Number was 10, and your comment ID was el60w10.
---
If you feel that way because you're concerned that it's too high a markup over blizzard's operating cost, there probably isn't much of a way I could change your mind. Unless blizzard was going to release internal budget documents, but I wouldn't hold your breath for that. It will be cheaper for them to operate today compared to 15 years ago. 
---
I look at it more in terms of the value I expect to get out of my 15 dollars. 15 bucks is about the cost of going to a movie, which I do every month. It's way less than a bar tab, which I rack up about every week. It's only a little more than a Netflix subscription and I'll probably get more hours a month out of wow than I do Netflix. So to me it's a good value for what I will get out of it. If I was worried about affording it I might second guess it, but I'd probably end up cutting out something else that's more of a waste in my eyes. I spent that every month in 2005 when I made a fraction of what I do now. 
---
Also I should mention, with inflation, 15 bucks in 2004 is worth about 19.50 today. So it's comparatively cheaper today.
---
Not that I remember. If that were true I imagine every single raid warrior would be using it to get 100 rage before every boss pull so it would be pretty obvious.
---
Imagine being “very angry” over a beta. I’m glad my life isn’t that sucky
---
Notre Dame
---
Oh man you got scammazed
---
holy shit, so I just randomly ended up on this subreddit. I haven't played WoW since probably 2007, stopping as a freshmen in high school but holy shit does this bring me back. I haven't thought of it much or played since. Despite the interacting with people, this was the thing I used to love about WoW, just exploring all the different places. Just looking at this and reading the names and seeing the shapes of the places really brings them back to me. I remember the places so clearly. How Stranglethrone Vale was such a nightmare because you could bump into random horde people at a seconds notice (although that was the fun really, trying to run away in the jungle). I still remember the first time I saw the night elf capital city and how awe struck I was by it. I used to be terrible at levelling up and everyone was faster then me and the main reason was because I would just run around and explore or help a random players find something. And despite being alliance I always loved how amazing the barrens looked. Fuck the wetlands though I hated that place. Oh man Westfall was fun too.
---
might be thinking of the side-effect of anger management? If you're in combat but not actively fighting you would generate 1 rage every 3 seconds. Definitely never generated rage out of combat entirely aside from blood rage.
---
Absolutely agree. Also thanks for coming up with a real response. People feel the need to shit on anyone who has a slightly different few than them without actually discussing anything at all. 
---
I think for me that I will wait to see if classic lives up to the hype and then I will play it. I will probably get a character to level 60 and then call it quits for good. Wow has changed my life so much but honestly I'm in a much different place these days where I can't take it as serious as before.
---
Not even trying to be cool! 
---
But I get the confusion. We're trying to have *fun*. We have so many characters planned out. We figure that starting with the craziest, but most fun combo would make sense in the long run.
---
Definitely possible, I did not know about this back in the day. I got this information from Kargoz's Priest leveling guide.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_CLytIpJniY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CLytIpJniY)

maybe a week of stresstest, and then in releases? April 26th, llong weekend, anyonne?
---
You can if you find someone willing to trade.
---
&gt; any multiplayer game
---
These are small player counts, and short lived. Classic WoW servers are large player counts (2500), and long lived (dedicated hardware per server). Its like asking how a Tesla isnt the same price as a Ford Pinto. 
---
&gt; private servers
---
I don't think you understand how the law works. Selling a product/service is not the same as taking donations. The Warcraft IP is not owned or licensed to these private servers. Donations offer a bit of a loophole around that.
---
How does it work on pvt servers vs vanilla? Is it just charge thats bugged?
---
Found a guild on some forums I was on that was planning to roll Horde + I mostly played Orc in WCIII.
---
Are you trolling, naive or dumb?
---
Druid
---
At the same time, if they threw in a cash shop or loot boxes like some other games, I'd probably feel differently. Not trying to say you should always be ok with price gouging or greedy companies, but to me 15 bucks feels reasonable in this case.
---
If I’m selected I would probably play for a few hours, to lvl 10 or so, and then not touch it.
---
I genuinely didn’t know.  I don’t have much experience playing betas so it was an honest question.
---
This is stupid on many levels, good job.
---
1. Like any game these days. There are even free to play games that only have multiplayer experience with much bigger fanbase than WoW. 
---
2. Donations covers the costs of servers because yes they cannot sell the game.

Agree with some parts and disagree with some. Ex how many griefers is too much? One shaman running through Elwyn killing lowbies is np but 10-50 within the last hour? Too much will kill things and the server dies as people stop playing. (What is it with redridge and horde btw?)
---
Sure wPvP can be nice but having the option to opt out is also great (hence PvP flagging).
---
Also agree with the notion of DK being a bad system, would much rather see it gone or at least a test of it being away.
---
Almost all my memories were really positive from Blizzard, it was a really great experience.  A lot of my friends went to the Austin call center, so I wouldn't really call it a bad or worst experience, but that one was a little bit of a bummer, I was strongly consider going myself.   
---
Worst day was a bad one but had nothing to do with Blizzard.  I remember I overslept and got a call asking where I was so I showed up majorly late, then like an hour into me arriving I got a call from my mom saying my grandfather died.  I was pretty distraught but I asked if I could stay and finish the day.  My head hurt all day and I remember one customer got really pissed at me and I was kinda upset but also tried not to take it personal.  I was still a temp at the time and I was pretty certain I wasn't gonna make the full time cut after this.  They gave me a week off to attend the funeral I came back and a month later was given full time status.  Seriously one of the happiest days, especially after all that.
---
The best are so many.  The two Blizzcons were amazing.  The first one I got to help set up the pro gamer stations for the Star Craft tournament and it was seriously cool.  There were a lot of fun break room shenanigans.  Really intense Smash Bros matches, me and my roommate used to go balls to the wall in foosball on our 15 minute breaks, major trash talk and everything.  Later on they added an OG Street fighter II machine and we would hold tournaments through out the day on our 15 minutes organized through email.  I was really good at the WoW:TCG and met and played with a lot of cool people.  They ran tournaments that were Wizards of the Coast Sanctioned and I won the Dev building tournament once, some of whom helped design the game.  I also got to run sanctioned tournaments for the Support building which I really enjoyed doing. 
---
 Just the general camaraderie people had with each other was pretty great.  It was pretty customary on someones last day to all go to lunch together as a team, the best is really lots of small moments like that.  Making everyone feel a part of the team was a huge part of the culture and something I really liked about it.
---
Well that's just economics. There are going to be people that wouldn't be willing to pay even $5 for it, but you can believe that they are fewer than those unwilling at $15. Furthermore the game is a risky investment by Blizzard. Who knows how long it will live, it could take away players from BfA. If you look at the closest parallel industry competitor - Old School Runescape, you can see that they charge a similar amount as well. So really it is unfortunate that you won't pay $15 however the price to demand is probably inelastic at this point and I wouldn't expect it to go down.
---
Haha yes, but never like that.  Any notation involved what you as a GM did to the account and why.  So you would note the action you took and maybe paste what they said and when.
---
It really sucked trying to clean up messes from GMs who were bad at putting notes on tickets.

Never allowed myself to be attacked.  I can't recall, but I don't think we would have taken damage.  Not 100% sure though!
---
Haha yeah people did challenge you to a duel, never accepted though ;)
---
It’s not overpriced because people will pay it. They’re a business and I can’t expect them to lower the price out of charity.
---
Hey. Wife and i will be playing together too. If you're going horde have her be shammy. They heal, aren't squishy, wear up to mail and shields and stuff so lots of gear options and different playstyle for all 3 specs. Think longevity, sometimes people get bored of single role classes cause always doing the same thing can get old even for a returning player. If you're going ally id say same thing go paladin or druid. Something that if she decides she is bored she can just respec and be like a whole new character.
---
I think it's pretty obvious the entire reason they went with this pricing model was because they have 2 million + prospective returning players that have quit over the last 12 years that will come back just for Classic and then over the next 2 years will probably at some stage run out of Classic enthusiasm but will just be a click away from trying out modern WoW. Similarly, but to a lesser extent, there will be the 5+ million modern WoW players who don't have much interest in Classic but will be just a click away from checking it out should the urge arise when they're sick of modern WoW or if they read a forum post or see a twitch stream that gets them interested.  
---
   
---
The $15/month has absolutely nothing to do with costs or dev time or upkeep. It's a marketing tool for current and prospective players to be apart of the Blizzard WoW 'ecosystem'. I mean yeah obviously there's a cost/profit business analysis going on somewhere, but rolling the cost into the current sub is a very obvious deliberate thing.
---
Another classic dungeon experience will be Hunters who forget to being enough ammo for the entire run or  Mages who have not learned the conjure food or water spell in Deadmines and will just run in circles jumping with the trade window still open.
---
Yeah they don't have to tune abilities or numbers or test player reaction. All they gotta do is make sure that the servers work and that it's as close to vanilla as possible. Pretty much the only things I can see the beta being used for is catching whatever small inconsistencies that may have not been caught by the internal team and server stability.
---
Druid would be a great option. Stealthing around behind your mates and popping out to heal them is always welcome, and enemy rogues hate Faerie Fire with an absolute passion. You level quickly in Feral spec, you bring some additional CC with entangling roots, and if you want to run some dungeons whilst levelling, you can go tank or healer, whatever is needed (more likely tank). 
---
Shaman is a good option too. Ultimate buffer, great at interrupts. Your windfury won't do much for your mates but they'll love you for your Chain Heals and purge.
---
You may not have been around for this at Blizzard but perhaps you might have insight anyways;
---
Blizzard introduced that when u transfer to a new server u cant get realm first titles. I transfered to a new guild doing Yogg 0 progression. We killed it but my cut-off was like 2.5 months out of 3. The friend I transfered with also. He ticketed to get the title and got it.... I ticketed and didn't get it. Should I just have been more vocal about my opposition? I worked hard on that fight with the guild x_x
---
Haha that is really cool. I never thought about how there are certain restrictions behind what you can say regarding help, but that is really interesting. Thank you for sharing :)
---
I've always assumed it was Tirisfal more specifically Scarlett Monastery, as it has the warlocks pet from earlier in the video that was over at Agamand Mills.
---
And the other characters in the trailer all go to fight their counter parts.  The Tauren goes to Dun Morogh, the Night Elf to the Barrens, assuming the mage then goes to Tirisfal. 
---
I don't think it is Kharazan as that there is foliage on the trees and it appears to be dawn/dusk where as dead wind pass is always dark.
---
Aw hell no. You know what man you did it. I'll gladly pay $15 a month over loot boxes shit. Just stay away from my game.
---
They announced classic wow as a "classic server option" which means u have to still pay the sub for the current retail game, but you are also getting a free option of classic. It is worth $15 regardless.
---
I don’t know. With which wow xpac have they opened it up to non-subs first. They probably just see it as a way to get people to sub early.
---
How do you download it?

did you get carpal tunnel syndrome?

This is such a lame meme template
---
Human Warlock on the Beta
---
Night Elf Druid on "retail".
---
Because that was my first choice back then.
---
Absolutely false.
---
It could just be a [Generic fantasy location] that just looked cool in the trailer.
---
Weird. We used a DKP system on the guild website. And turning down natural upgrades that were then sharded to retain points had a penalty.
---
H Y P E D !
---
How do we filter the good from bad testers ?
---
Bonus point if you're a mage :D
---
There aren't enough people that want rp-pvp servers to add one for every region.
---
This. Pala is easy to level and if you play a Warrior with it you will have no downtime.

You can't, either fake or datamine
---
This right here. Those are some really good points. I would really be interested in a study looking at different pay models and seeing which ones are most effective for the business as well as the consumer. For instance, one time sum, vs subscriber based, vs ftp micro transaction based.
---
I am not going to play the beta because it will definitely ruin the hype for me and excitement/discovery.
---
Okay.
---
Nice photoshop
---
And that's why that as a druid you tank in dungeon. In the long run having no normal res is better because that mean you can be lazy when your raid wipe.
---
Alliance music is better, also, horde are more often shady af, not able to relate to it.  Also, no decent looking races, not going to play something that looks like crap.
---
No, I’m pretty sure MrGM showed it downloaded (but couldn’t get to the login screen) and I trust him.
---
It’s on the CDN and it’s unencrypted
---
That's my thought process and reasoning as well. However I did overlook that you get retail with it..probably cuz I don't play that shit.

I wanted to start as Orc Warrior because i was a Orc player in Wc2 &amp; 3 but my clan all played Alliance ( 8 Druids, 2 Warriors and 1 Priest) and they ganked my the first 2 Days.
---
So i had to switch and look what is close to a mighty Orc warrior and saw pala, played a lot of D2, so a free mount, heals and wearing 2h with plate was a no brainer.
---
I'm killing time on a pserver leveling out a class I don't want to play in a zone I don't want to play. I may as well do it in a beta.
---
MC...
---
Queue people going mad when dungeon finder is datamined ;)
---
Server needs to to disable combat logs in scenarios like this.
---
It's the biggest culprit.
---
To be fair his first post did come of as elitist while second sounds a lot more reasonable.
---
In any case I am sure everyone will be able to find a guild that matches their own expectations and ambitions.
---
There will be guilds with 0 prep and guilds with a lot of prep. You just have to find the one that suits you.
---
"B-But they don't need to do a beta, it's an old game!"
---
Make sure to get killed about 5 seconds into kiting drakkisath
---
It sounds like it was a really great job, great enough to put up with angry customers on bad days. I'm kind of jealous of that awesome work atmosphere that they fostered, I hope that magic is still alive today. I like to think all that goes back into making the Warcraft community a great place for everyone.
---
Of course, I stayed in def stance and applied my 5 sunder to keep agro. Worked every time. /s
---
A warrior that tells me hunters are easy in PVP IS a bad warrior.
---
Next you're going to tell me that you crush mages ...
---
Can confirm. My PC is 13 years old and I got invited to pretty much every beta within the first 2 waves.
---
Mages are the easiest imo &amp; what I will level first. Once you hit 20 its aoe farming all the way to 60 with 1.5k gold
---
Nope.  Generally to get a ban it had to be game breaking in some sense.  Continual bad behaviors could do it to, but in general GMs don't wanna ban players.  We wanted players playing and the people we wanted to ban were the ones infringing on our ability to help you do that (like bots and gold spammers)
---
Hue hue hue
---
as some already stated it you are not paying 15$ for Classic (i would be fine with it) but you pay 15$ for a WoW sub that includes Classic. So you can play Retail up to Legion (if you do not have BFA) and can play Classic.
---
I think this was the best way because most players can just switch between retail when the content is clear or back to retail when they have done the weekly Raids in Classic.
---
That's cute in all but I'm gonna main Druid
---
*Feral* Druid
---
They have to test the new client with the old data in mass player count. How do the servers behave, are there some skills that do not work right when used with other class skills. Are the mob respawn right, do the sharding work etc etc etc
---
Chinese was with raisins
---
You ended this mans career !!
---
"Your f\*cking offline friends" hehehe
---
Lmao most definitely not fake or photoshop, unencrypted build that has been pushed through. Easily done
---
no one knows, but i definetally wont get a retail sub for that hypothetical chance.
---
Wait, do I have to sign up somewhere right now?
---
It’s real, unencrypted build that was pushed through
---
Therefore, what is your position on loot trading and what do you think will be the impact on wow classic?
---
And it's got that refreshing silverpine tree smell.
---
Hummm Yeah my morals do speak against it but still tempting for me!
---
Hah!  every once in awhile yeah.  The more likely scenario is the ERP was leaking into a public channel and they got reported.  If wasn't harassment and in tell we probably had no reason to ever see it, but every once in awhile you might catch something in proximity cause they got reported for say something else at essentially the same time.
---
Your actions IG absolutely reflects who you are IRL.
---
If you ninja IG, I know that if you don't steal IRL it's because of the consequences, not because you are moral.
---
Can you play it?
---
Very true. It really is a safe bet for blizzard. I'm kind of surprised they havent made classic earlier. They don't have to put a lot of resources into it as the game is already been made. If people don't like it they still have retail to play and if people do like it then they look really good and they can make future remakes of expansions. Really classic wow should only bring $$$ in for blizzard.
---
Nice. The same turds screaming fake will be the same turds who said we weren't getting a beta because it's an old game. lrn2software
---
Gnome Warlock, because we're annoying af
---
God damn this brings a tear to my eye
---
Yeah i think that is the reason why most people like Classic. Having a lvl 60 Chars is a big time investment. Also working for you Equip is something to show of (i know drop luck is still rng) but the worst part in Retail is the stupid Titanforging ultra mega what ever. 
---
Run a HC dungeon with my GF and she got a ring that has the same ilvl as in normal raid. That is just crazy. It is like getting  Spinal Reaper from a boss in Strath
---
No-one cares if you RP. Just play on a PvP server.
---
I will jot change your mind.
---
If you are too frugal to pay $0.50 a day to play a game that you will probably play hours every day, then there is no need to even approach changing your mindset
---
This is a business, and their game is their product.  Everyone else is willing to pay, so they won’t be lowering it foe you
---
So, how do you choose to interpret it?
---
 Soon"™ basically means it's done when it's done, so it's tells us nothing.
---
Yeah but you have to get invited at least once to be able to report bugs to get invited back...
---
It will be the same as it was back in the day. So, no.
---
This may sound ignorant, but there were really calls for legacy servers just 3 years after the game’s release? 
---
Was this the first instance of wanting a “vanilla” version of an MMO? 
---
Did EverQuest have similar sentiment?
---
I loved my priest, but in reality I have known really skilled players of every class, I don't really feel like you can go wrong no matter what you choose.  I was very into playing a healer at the time so Priest suited me, and I loved PvP healing too.
---
As a player I try and encourage everyone to play with people that share their same values and ones they will have fun with.  Even for hardcore players WoW is still a social game, so no matter what your commitment if you find like minded players I think that is how you end up getting the most out of it.
---
Was there a way a GM could abuse its power to help guild mates or spawn things without someone notice?
---
Or was everything you to log like players, heard that every trade you made with other players got tracked and every mail.
---
omg this is so like me right now  😂  😂  😂  😂  😂  😍  😭   🙂

---
Totally agree with you. I played nearly everyday from release up till Cat. By then I had a good job, married and first child was just born. I couldn’t keep up with folk at all, so stopped playing.
---
What I’m excited about with classic, is that it shouldn’t take long to get to 60, even playing casually. I loved questing solo and now the areas really well. I aim to play an hour or two a day, casually on the sofa with a gaming laptop, and love the idea that 60 isn’t too hard to get to. Then I can run 5-15 mans easily enough in pugs, and might even get to MC or BWL. Will see how that plays out.
---
Also, I loved AV weekends, healing the fights on the bridge or trying to battle the alliance Zerg! 
---
Defo excited about classic, hope it is everything I hope it is, as even now I miss playing wow! 😂👍
---
We did ZG before MC in my guild in vanilla..  /shrug
---
Had the third one for ages as Wallpaper. Got then replace with the WoW logo made out of the iname Icons
---
That's just stupidity. Do you also believe every action in d&amp;d reflect the players true intentions and wanted actions? Because if you do you are someone who has a poor disconnect between fantasy and reality. Not everyone has this disconnected.
---
And make sure to die in a really annoying position and release your ghost before going so the healer and stumble around wanting to die trying to find the corpse to res you.

Are we finally going to get infinite draw distance in vanilla?

---
I thought there was **no** sharding?
---
Because the first wand quest reward is at level 11/13 or later, and for classes like Warlock/Priest, having a wand is essential. Not having a wand @ 5 will slow your progress by almost half (Needing to eat/drink/mana regen)
---
It should be pretty good. Blizzcon demo was already an old build by the time Blizzcon came around and it's been 6 months since then to make a game that has every asset and design decision already made.
---
I hope it releases in the beginning of July.
---
i would say that the Classic we get took a shit load of work. You can see this in the Panel they hold on the last Blizzcon where they talked how difficult it was to get the old data and then converting the old data to work with the new client.
---
But now they figure it out it will easy to make a TBC and a WOTLK remake after that
---
Eh if you work from home you most likely always get a VPN connection to connect to the companys network.
---
I'm doing the same on Netherwing right now, playing a Warlock to get the feel.
---
I lol'd
---
okay great now blizz now just give us the Beta, i mean most of us would sub for it (i would).
---
If you want people to come begging roll dwarf priest
---
No, it's just Lara Croft with her hair down.
---
How did you get there?
---
Really, weird, I will check settings. I posted it straight from youtube to reddit. Thanks for letting me know
---
What are you doing!? Thwarting my plans!?
---
Yeah paladins in classic is really good. Get some return damage items and specc into prot/Holy. 
---
Use hand of Edward the odd to self heal during the pull.
---
Nothing comes close to mages tho as they can pull "unlimited" amounts
---
Honestly the difference between Classic Wow and Retail is so large that they are barely even the same game. 
---
Classic WoW is still very much an RPG, with mechanics built off tabletop games and RPGs before it. 
---
Retail WoW is really a Third Person action game/mobile game at this point.
---
There will most likely be sharding during launch. For how long after, we don't know but what Blizzard has said is that it would only stay for launch and a given time period after, to secure server stability and playability.
---
Honestly I sort of agree with them if it only stays for the first few days.
---
Lock is curse then shadowbolt. Not too intensive. If you get agro run to the tank
---
ohhh my sweet summer child, there will be Sharding but they have not decided how. 
---
They want it for the starting zones but have not told us how many players per shard, what location (like all of elwynn or just the start) or how long it will last (first weeks or months?)
---
Cool. Where can I get this now?
---
[haha yes](https://preview.redd.it/o3e8u4gqiow01.jpg?width=625&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=639be7fba0be74c3a8aa4c343681f56414593887)
---
In Cata. They broke Razorgore by patching Cho'gal. I had a Lead GM crack the eggs for me for a month until they fixed the mind control orb. I'd just write a ticket with his name and say tell him its BWL raid tonight! 
---
Fun times.
---
I didn't get to do any special events like that.  They probably had senior and lead GMs designated for that, but I can't recall.
---
Haha yeah, we did technically have the power to spawn and delete stuff at will.   Pretty rare to catch a little show like that, but that's kinda what made it special too.  In general we didn't want to have an effect on the World, that was up to you guys to do!
---
I can tell you that it will not. Subbed since Vanilla (just got banned for a total of 5 or so months) and never got into an alpha (besides HOTS but only i won one on Gamecom) or beta for a Blizzard game.
---
My acc was created when WC2 bnet edition got released.
---
Yes, definitely. I wouldn’t say that this hierarchy was the case for every single upgrade large or small, more so that it’ll dictate first access to the best weapons available in a new raid tier. Stick around for long enough and you can absolutely end up an undead with CTS/Maladath, it would just require some patience for all the rogues to get an equal or better offhand (which would be mid to late AQ patch).  In the mean time, rock a quel’serrar, annihilator, nightfall, or some other BoE weapon early game and you’ll do just fine.

Did that as well since my gf never saw it. It was so damn good, but also some parts that wasnt.

Hi, /u/beyonce212

Have you looked at them
---
It's like saying that a twitch chat with 100k viewers is more social than a twitch stream with like 1-2k viewers.
---
Yeah, there's more messages, but are you really making friends or actually communicating with anyone?
---
Human paladin. Pvp server. It is my charge to dleiver justice to the filth of the Horde.
---
Playing on a PS with ny friends and it just makes the hype even bigger
---
I played extensively subscription based games, F2P games, and GW2 that has the B2P model you're talking about in your post.
---
I've also experienced transitioning from sub to F2P on 3 different games. It sucked.
---
FP2 games overall quality is abysmal compared to subs because MMORPGS are very expensive to make **and maintain** and they need the money somehow, so shops all the way up to P2W.
---
It all comes down to what *you* deem valuable.
---
I understand I may be a minority but I vastly prefer sub models to F2P because my time is valuable and I seek a quality experience, bugs/exploits fixed in a timely manner, decent CS, no microtransaction crap.

If you cant' make the distinction between killing a NPC and a player, you really need to make the connection.
---
Video games have direct influences on players mood : first time I will kill Kelthusad I'll probably feel different than being chain killed at a flight point in phase 2, don't you think ?
---
This is the reason I stopped playing wow after cat expansion was released. 
---
Classic wow did feel epic. Not many folk had roc mounts on many alts, a 100g was a shed load of cash. It was still a time sink, but it was slower progression. Clearing instances was a great feeling.
---
I remember the excitement and sense of achievement when my guild finally killed Rags in MC, and then Nef in BWL. Having full T2 was seen as an epic achievement. (I was short of my legs.....damn you Rags!!!🤨🤨).
---
I’m hoping that classic wow brings this back. Casual players can get to 60 and run lots of instances with folk looking for BiS before raiding. 
---
Folk will need to go out and quest again, group up with folk on your server, rather than stand in main cities and pug instance level.
---
I’m excited, and if it half lives up to my expectations, then I’ll be awesome!  😀👍
---
Whoa, I worked in a call center as a temp and one of my worst days was finding out my grandpa died too.  That’s uncanny.
---
On a heartfelt note, my sincerest condolences for your loss.  I truly understand just how crappy a day that is.  &lt;3
---
Fine. Go back to private servers and shut up.
---
It's not "fake" or "datamine", it's the literally the game lmao
---
Honestly, I think they'll look at accounts that have played WoW the longest / oldest WoW accounts. 
---
I think I'm set.
---
I don't think you were getting rage but you were not loosing what you had.
---
It's something that might have been patched.
---
You could teleport there using cheatengine. I wanted to quit at the time as i was playing all the time and wasnt studying. I got disconnected like 5 seconds after the teleport
---
Copyright 2018?
---
That's rude man.
---
You take this game way too seriously then...
---
$15 is nothing for the amount of hours you're going to get out of it. One trip to the theatre is likely double that with a box of popcorn. Stop being a cheapskate.
---
Hahaha, this is why you never just Google twink gear
---
The game is too big. You need thousands of players smashing it with a hammer all at once to find all the little oddities.
---
Also MMORPGs are a lot different where micro transactions can very much ruin the game easily. Good points.
---
There won't be anything left standing in phase 2, even the grass won't regrow !
---
As we don't know how long the beta will be it doesn't really change anything about the July 16th theory. It's still our best bet for a release date.
---
So like how they tested bfa ?
---
Its confirmed it wont be in
---
Assuming you didn't go to outlands, no it was true.  They ran out of quests in the old kingdoms, they even admitted it in interviews.
---
You are very welcome!  It's been fun!!  Lemme see what I can remember,
---
The ones we used the most were definitely either teleport to player, or teleport the player to us, depending on the situation.  As an item specialist you would spawn items frequently.  We had an insta kill button that was primarily used for stuck or bugged mobs.  We could go up to really crazy run speeds, walk through walls and probably  few other things I might remember later, in addition to the ones you mentioned.
---
GM client was an in house made program that basically functioned like an instant messenger with all the info a GM would need to function.  If for whatever reason that couldn't fix the issue we had a horde and an alliance character to go in game with on a GM client version of the game.  Same basic interface but with command prompt abilities more or less.
---
Unfortunately no screen shots!  All work done on their computers at their offices so nothing I could pull up from my own computer.
---
Were you one of the same people that said we wouldn't get a beta because "it's an old game"? 
---
ALL content needs testing. You don't just push out software assuming every aspect will work because "nothing's changed". That's not how it works. Shoving 1.12 data into an 8.X client is going to cause bugs across the board, even if they're very hard to find.
---
This is not Clash of Clans, in WOW you're either all in or you go nowhere.
---
People that don't take the game seriously never reach lvl 60.
---
Even if they updated their beta files, which they didn’t and there really isn’t any new news, this doesn’t mean we will be getting a beta. Like, when deva create a game, they work on the /beta/ files of the game. They aren’t going to be working on “Classic WoW full release ready to ship” files. Call me an idiot, but I certainly work on beta files when I program.
---
Nothing to really gauge it on, probably up until a week before release to polish up everything possible?
---
won't be able to play before he has a beta flagged account and a server is up. Well, maybe he ca ndo some kinda world edit shenanningans but what would be the point =P
---
Official release is going to be where its at. No need to gain access to a beta I already know the game.
---
&gt;Here was the ZG plague story!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;When I arrived to work that day my roommate who was on the overnight shift came up to me the moment I walked in the door and said something to the effect of, 'OMG IT'S ABSOLUTE MADNESS, EVERY SERVER HAS THE PLAGUE"  I had no idea what I was walking into, total mass hysteria, in the best way possible.  
---
&gt;No one knew what to do, how to handle it, what the chain of command for dealing with it was, tickets were flooding in way WAY faster than we could answer them, and we were all laughing our asses off the entire time.  
---
&gt;Generally 99% of tickets are real clear cut and in that 1% that involves a little extra thought you would check with a manager or if it was real serious they would check with a Lead.  This was every ticket that day.  
---
&gt;Eventually the leads appeared in major cities and summoned people into the air to cure the plague.  Even then there were so few leads and so many servers it wasn't even fully resolved by the end of my shift.  That day was pretty much legend from there on out.
---
So pretty
---
Sounds like a private server issue.
---
I have never purely grinded due to lack of quests. 
---
Not once. Not in 2004/5 and never since.
---
I had multiple 60s in real vanilla. My first 60 was in January in 2005. My last was mid 2006. I nolifed the majority of vanilla as a college kid. 
---
A lot of kids grinded. A lot of MMO newbies grinded and a lot of older players ended up grinding. 
---
The vast majority of RPG and MMO vets I played with actively sought out quests even if the method and route wasn’t efficient as a LOT of us were well over grinding from days spent doing so in EQ and other MMOs. 
---
If you looked, researched and made the effort to travel and do, there was sufficient. Especially if you did all the dungeon quests from 45-60 as particularly 50+ there were a tonne for each dungeon. We did them all. 
---
I was 60 well before any searing gorge update, sithilus update, hinterlands update etc etc. never grinded.
---
It's not so much about being cheap but rather looking at what makes the game worth $180 a year. For me I believe retail isn't worth that much. Classic would be worth that for me if they offered development. But that's why I'm interested in hearing other opinions in how people view their money.
---
Don't think I've literally laughed out loud at a comment like that in quite some time.
---
fml
---
just when I was going to be hyped about classic
---
dude u could get rich on youtube.
---
Well content creators aren’t Blizzards public announcers, they have their artistic freedom to do whatever they like. Many of the given information could have been summarized easily, but there are more aspects to ”content creation” than just announcing new information.
---
Yes. :)
---
Would spriest be worth it. in my 13 years of wow ive never once played healer.
---
Hard to say but I really hope they opt for a short one.
---
Cool anecdote
---
Okay so how tho
---
I think you should use Poopoohead
---
What makes the game worth a $180? How about the hundreds of hours of entertainment you're going to get out of it?
---
Would be nice to be able to pay less for just classic... bfa doesn't really deserve the sub.
---
Were you with the company when the Martin Thunder incident happened? What was the in-house reaction?
---
That's a really good way to look at it. Heavily leaning towards mage, except I have blurry visions of myself as a lvl 42 stealthing around STV, waiting for someone to cheap shot. But in all honesty, I just envisioned myself having of lots of frostbite procs while farming Tyr's Hand. That was the first thing that came to mind after reading your reply. Gotta be mage.
---

The dreadlord you think of is actually further east of Mankrik's body.

Casual.

&gt; Because raptors use chests...right?

Clever girls!
---
it is not a bad thing when it is only for the starting areas and for the first 2 weeks or so because lets be real here you will have 0 chance to tag any mob the first 24 hours if you are not with a premade grp
---
I have a friend who's going to roll Lock, and I'm afraid we won't play much together while gearing if I play mage. Oh well.
---
That's been the number one argument of people on private server bUt We WoUlD pAy A sUb If We CoUlD!1!1
---
Good to know that you wouldn't.
---
You're right.
---
How long did it take to solo those packs ?
---
Was it worth it or just for the challenge ?
---
If I recall correctly, Blizzard has not increased the subscription cost in all of Wow's history(in USD terms). We're nearing the 15-year mark "soon". During that period the consumer price index has seen an increase of 28.6%, so in other words inflation rate is almost 29%. Personally it's a pretty good deal considering the sub cost could be $20 a month right now.
---
I don't speak for Blizzard in any way at this point, as I haven't worked there for over a decade, but I will say one thing I took from the experience is that the people I worked with genuinely cared and were very excited to be a part of the World of Warcraft experience.  The message I took from my experience is that the company cared and wanted to provide that kind of experience for the players.  One that made gamers say they wished every company would do it the way Blizzard does.  That was a real feeling in the air and many of the GMs had it!
---
I have multiple level 60s on pservers and back in retail. I have hundreds of days played time and I understand that's it's just a video game. You sound like an addict that doesn't understand that's it's a simulation... not real life
---
Troll Priest PvP. In limbo between Undead and Troll. Rolling PvP because I've always been a PvE focused player who has played on PvE servers exclusively. I've basically never engaged in world PvP. Getting ganked is gunna suck, and I'm trash at PvP, but I want to experience the game in a way I never have.
---
15 bucks today is less than it was 15 years ago :) you also pay for stability and longlivety. If you dont care to play with that security then go play private servers
---
So this could possibly never happen?
---
But what does it mean???
---
I love Gnome casting animation. It’s marvelous!
---
lul
---
luckily you get to make more than one character ;)
---
I'm sure it'll be better than bfa beta.
---
Warlocks and healers always seem to be in demand.
---
I want them to name the beta servers normal white guy names. Like Larry and Steve.
---
retail players are used to not having flying mounts at this point...
---
Total hours from MC -&gt; BWL - AQ40 -&gt;Naxx you feel is less than the 6 week grind for warlords? ( mean even without multiplying the hours x 40, you'd be similar)

I'm not being argumentative for no sake, I just feel your perspective is wrong here - I struggle to see how they'd move the warlords dps/stats without it breaking the game, i feel they did really well for where they sit  
---
Better than BWL, worse than Naxx (for pvp). But available much earlier.
---
From my experience the alliance was always in need of warlocks and on the horde side it was hard to gather even a few hunters.
---
I would go back and check the collection ;)
---
Just finished up Rag, KT, and the Dark Portal.
---
To my understanding spriest is used for 1 spot after 16 debuff slots are available. That coincided with the ZG patch on private servers.
---
But in those cases it was often decided beforehand who was the designated spriest.
---
But perhaps to answer the bigger question spriest do not have a lot of leverage.
---
It is often a spot of contention for many priests and there is only one spot so... and not every guild even uses it.
---
That isn’t to say there will be guilds with multiple spriest spots. Just my general experience.
---
Good looking out.
---
No, they will want a healing priest.
---
If I am selected, I'm not going to "play", but to test, to see, if there are any problems and bugs, so I report it to the devs. That's why it's called beta-test. "Playing" beta makes no sense, cause characters will be deleted in the end anyways.
---
Given the fact that most classic wow content creators play on private servers... wouldnt it be strange if they got beta access? Terms of service and all that ?
---
They will use the community to find more discrepancies between Vanilla and Classic.
---
Probably the types who petition in saying they accidentally deleted extravagant items even though they never had them.  Yes, I understand you are missing your Thunderfury, but I can't restore it for you because I can't seem to locate when it was deleted... Also you are level 33, a priest and don't have the quest to enter Molten Core completed in your quest log...
---
I stopped the game at the beginning of TBC (plus a one month try at Legion), and I just have a lvl 33 char on a random pserver. Who's the addict ? :p
---
Priest is the straghtforward healing class, so that's a good way to go.
---
What class will you be playing?
---
&gt; 1.13, who'd have thought that'd ever happen.
---
Same thing happened in War3 where they patched a new minor version after years of not doing anything with the game.
---
A few months later we got the War3:C announcement.
---
Technically they've lowered it already by not increasing it from what it originally was.
---
&gt; Wasn’t that the demo version number?
---
Yes, the demo version was also 1.13.
---
Beta is going to drop soon, after they choose who to invite and which setups they want to test the game on.
---
Maybe next month?
---
99% of free to play games have cash shops which most of us will happily pay $15/month to not have incorporated into classic wow.
---
Even private servers have cash shops and there have been many that have been uncovered to have been dealing with some shady guilds for extra cash.
---
"Woah captain, what is that crazy island? Holy shit, are those dinosaurs? They are fucking huge!"    
---
"Doesnt look like anything to me"
---
Was there any sort of system in place to keep tabs on your regular player accounts to make sure you didnt give yourself stuff?
---
OOF
---
MY HEART
---
Its the issue of choice I feel - rather than an artificial interface preventing you for engaging you are given a choice.
---
You see a member of the horde say - they are fighting a demon - you could attack them, leave then or even aid them (if you aid them you can't be using AoE etc).
---
Normal RP servers actively punish AoE classes as well as trolls can just try to kick your flag on via getting tagged by your AoE's etc and a rogue you won't see until they do that.
---
You get turds no matter what server type - at least on RP-PvP you can eliminate them brutally and deal with it yourself if it comes from the other faction - from your own faction is always harder but if guilds work together to segregate those people's ability to play content such as raids etc that is pretty fitting for classic/vanilla.
---
The guy saying this game is life, good try turning it though.
---
Gnomes
---
just... no
---
Yes. Uldum, Twilight Highlands, Hyjal atleast that were added in Cataclysm
---
Blizz has to continuously pay for **large scale** server hosting, ddos protection, security, management, licensing, database management/backups, website/cdn hosting, and any repairs. In addition to that they have to pay for extra GM management, technical support and probably other things aswell.
---
A one time purchase just wouldn't work long term unless they add micro transactions or something which is a no go for vanilla. 15$ gametime for both Classic and Retail really isn't that bad.
---
Because this isn't a game released in 2004. Classic isn't an old game, it is a new game with a new client and new server with old data.
---
So who is Ass King?
---
If he decided on shaman the WF comes very naturally
---
Definitely never encourage.  Minor violations could be subject to getting swept under the rug.  It wasn't our goal to go around banning people, we wanted the players to be enjoying the game.  So if it was something like 'damn didn't get a drop on this one either' and someone reported it for some reason, we probably would let it go, even though technically it was in violation of the policy.
---
Encouraging a violation wouldn't happen, we would always tell players to stay safe and follow the ToS to ensure no issues.
---
Make sure you're actually getting informed opinions about patch 1.12.  For instance, people saying rogues are totally busted are thinking of earlier patches when they were wildly overpowered, they're just pretty good in 1.12.
---
Same! But since all my friends are going all I'll be rolling gnome.
---
Up until close to release.
---
Healers as always, Priest/Paladin. Warlock on alliance. Hunter horde. 
---
Fury warr is always needed.
---
Never heard of this, private server or otherwise. Right-clicking doesn't really put you in combat, you can still charge in that state, for example. Rage should decay as normal.
---
Its a build nummer. This is standard procedure.
---
You might not want to, but that's literally how they do it.  The encrypted builds where we can't see version numbers and the like are only usable by employees with a decryption key, but we can still see the files existence.
---
Even later then you were 4 weeks ago, but here's my plan anyway:
---
Go tailoring/herb at launch, craft Truefaith Vestments and swap out tailoring for alchemy.
---
The Truefaith Vestments are bis for a long time so they're worth the investment (so I've been told).
---
I'm at work right now so I can't look it up, but people have created listst of all the herbs you'll need in order to "catch up" on alch skill @ 60.
---
Since you're considering going herb/alch, this route might be suitable for you too!
---
Why?  The client will be keeping up with Retail in terms of bug fixes and exploit patches, both for the client and the Addon API.  Otherwise the moment you find an exploit in Retail it will \*never be patched\* in Classic.
---
it never carries over from a real beta.
---
The point of a beta is to stress test the servers, test optimization by letting people with different computers play and to find bugs/unintended mechanics by throwing players at content.
---
So there's no real point in playing the beta since you're technically just a guinea pig testing stuff, you aren't actually there to play the game and progress. 
---
The term has been watered down though, just the word "demo" and "alpha".
---
Hello, old friend.
---
We could see pretty much anything we needed to solve your problem.  Your inventory, quests completed, chat logs, aggro lists, locations, characters on your account.  If I can think of any others I will add them but basically whatever info in WoW there was to be had, we had it.
---
I wish I knew that!  I am dying to know myself!!
---
Least played are the DPS spec of healing classes : Retpal, Boomkin, SP, Elem/Enh Shaman... Basically if you have a healing spec in your talent tree, you'll be asked to heal. 
---
Every other class and spec are needed/playable in raid (besides PvP specs like Subtlety Rogues, or things like survival hunters). 
---
Don't worry about it and play the class you like the most :^ ^)
---
Sometimes you get stuff for participating in a beta. Diablo 3 for example gave out some unique achievements/customizations. But the chances of something like that happening with Classic are... lets just say really fucking low.
---
I had this thought yesterday. I'm just going to hop in and chill with a random class and fuck around with people.
---
On release, I'm probably gonna quit my job  or something
---
The folder is `_classic_` not `_classicbeta_` suggesting that its not just for beta.
---
Then again, they're clearly still having deployment changes so that may change.
---
Thanos likes
---
Somewhere in there!
---
Looks like old magic cards. Funny this was my time playing magic and wc3
---
You could stockpile healing items and go there from elf tree trough fatigue waters.
---
Actually it doesn‘t matter. It will be a completely new experience regardless if you play bfa before classic or reversed. I still recommend classic because it‘s one hell of a good game &lt;3
---
If I had to guess (and I am guessing), we'll get beta in a week and then it'll run for about 8 weeks.
---
Maybe I don't get the question properly, but as an EU player since 2005, WoW has always used yards as far as I can remember. It used to confuse me a bit, but eventually I assumed 1 meter equaled 1 yard.
---
Oh, yeah that kinda confirms it. It'll function just like the _retail folder for BfA then and the game will be launched through the dropdown in the battle.net-client.
---
&gt;I'd be very surprised if they share a client completely and it's just a tab in the realm selector but it's definitely a possibility, the addon situation would turn in to a huge mess though.
---
Its definitely a separate executable, but like PTR it'll be reusing Retail's asset files where possible.  The options for starting the app are either more entries in the Account selector in the Blizzard Agent app, or a separate Game Icon with the account list duplicated for Classic.
---
Yes it was!  Very boring place!  
---
Many players thought it was us running around and partying, but it's just a buncha GMs standing around!
---
My first green item.  It was a cloth robe, and I was playing a paladin.  I remember thinking, "wow, the items come in GREEN?"  little did I know.
---
I would pay 30 a month. And not even bat an eye at that. 15 dollars is not a lot of money to the majority of wow player base.
---
Why are you so poor?
---
&gt;what exactly other than interface elements can you datamine from the beta client
---
The biggest "Hmmm, lets see" will be what elements of retail's assets are reused, and how much of the old textures and models Classic has to redeploy.
---
There were several ways to get there. All involved either a glitch or changing data.
---
Healers are always easiest. 
---
Other than that, honestly they are all somewhat in demand but not much difference, it's all really just about standing out
---
but it's not the OP's screenshot
---
For warlock it barely matters. You have corruption, immolate, curse of agony and imp. You can even melee after dots to start mana regen. Your wand is only a small fraction of your overall dps.
---
For priest it's slightly better. You might break even on time.
---
Well, on US official forums some people posted that they received beta invites without being subbed. Maybe it's true.
---
Yep.  Different Interface folder allows different addons etc.  The client will just cherry pick from Retail where it can and download what's unique to Classic.
---
I believe [this](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7064) should be enough.
---
Definitely.  I will always consider vanilla WoW the version I fell in love with.  I am really excited for classic and am eagerly awaiting the nostalgia/the people I will meet on my journeys!
---
You got a working deployment off the network?
---
I ask because your Copyright value is not updated to 2019, which makes me think that this is a photoshop.
---
Thwarting your plans?
---
Oh nice, they fixed the deployment issues.
---
I wonder how many art assets (textures, sound etc.) have been removed from the game over the years. I bet they're still in there so that the separate _classic folder won't have to be particularly large at all.
---
Even if they updated the texture for the grass in Mulgore at some point for example I don't think they would remove the old one from the game files and it's still in there somewhere.
---
I seem to remember that you can still play sound files from the original naxx that wasn't in the wotlk version of the instance.
---
I'm not sure.  I would think on some level probably, but all my time there we were still banning the ones we found, and players were tipping us off to many.  There are other anti cheating measures in place but those were not really something a GM ever really got introduced to.
---
Nope. Only method has access to it.
---
I'd say the least played classes are warlock, hunter and druid.
---
I’d pay $30 a month for classic
---
Greetings Fourdayz!  This is former Game Master Mikimao.  I can certainly help you with your request to have your question answered during that time frame!  Is there anything else I can help you with?
---
CLASSIC LAUNCH RELEASED!!
---
Reading the Twitter message out loud
---
Quickly stating that there is no hint on an official release date
---
Followed by going through blizzards history handling release shedules. Starting with warcraft 1
---
Conclusion :16 th july, but we cant be sure yet
---
Easy moneyz
---
Follow up topic : will we have an open beta?
---
Yay multithreaded!
---
Don't need this type of negativity. Don't pay, don't play
---
Which is what I've been suggesting ever since the announcement. It makes even more sense if they plan to release TBC and Wrath. 
---
Every version of the game can share assets with the others instead of having completely separated clients which would take up a lot of space on your hard drive if you wanted to have every version installed.
---
How do you think the community reacted when I tried to explain that it would work like that? ;-)
---
&gt; is classic WoW coming out as patch 1.12 or patch 1.13?
---
WoW Classic will very likely release as 1.13. It could release as 1.14, but I don't think it will (it would break current Blizzard patch version practices).
---
&gt; And what does this mean if its truly patch 1.13?
---
This means there are substantial changes between 1.12 and 1.13. But there will not be "expansion level" changes.
---
&gt; what are the updates?
---
1.13 is WoW Vanilla changed so it does work with new Blizzard databases, the Blizzard launcher, the new Battlenet integration, the new rendering methods and probably a few more minor changes.
---
The question "what are the updates?" in this context is very hard to answer if you don't say what you really mean with the question.
---
I'd imagine they'll want to test features like dungeons/raids/pvp/bg's etc. i don't think they'll allow people to level from 1-60 in the beta because then it'll reduce peoples incentive to play the real game
---
nelf warrior pvp server. wish me luck.
---
You forgot about progressive itemization, right click report and non authentic realm sizes. You have to mention that in every video :)
---
This is cool.  If you are into stuff like this, check out a thing called [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/).  I think this is what was used to make this.
---
Really excited what the people will report about the beta.
---
Great news
---
My Bro is rolling NE Hunter, I'm rolling NE priest and a common friend rolling Druid.
---
At first I thought about a Gnome Warlock, we could tank dungeons with Voidwalker + Bear + our druid healing but it will be smoother with Druid as tank and myself as healer.
---
Nice, hopefully we get some reports on how good or bad the beta is and the overall feeling.
---
Yup!  you worked in a room with a bunch of other GMs, there was Blizzard memorabilia all over the place and video games in the break room!
---
They got bills to pay lol
---
You are the real mvp
---
I got into legion beta and bfa alpha while not being subbed for ~6 months, so subscription is probably irrelevant. Your account age and standing seems to be more important. Make sure you have actually opted in for beta access in your bnet settings aswell, it's not on by default.
---
Usually a beta is released within two weeks after being uploaded to the CDN.
---
:( you will be missed on OCE :(
---
Would you also be able to detect if the account was logged on from....say.... a chinese IP adress? And would that fact be part of the evidence?
---
Bullshit.
---
At least in the classic demo the draw distance slider was removed. 
---
You get environmental detail and ground clutter sliders. 
---
[https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wow-Classic-Demo-Graphical-Options-1480x1151.jpg](https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Wow-Classic-Demo-Graphical-Options-1480x1151.jpg)
---
No. Absolutely not.
---
But I'm relieved people get to test it. The demo showed that the community is on the same page as blizzard for an authentic experience. 
---
More eyes on a project, means less mistakes.
---
Ythisens said on stream a while back that being a current WoW subscriber would not affect your chances of getting an invite to Classic beta (and at the time he said that he wasn't sure if there even would be a beta).
---
Theres no 20slot from dm...
---
Sorry to be the one to tell you this, but it's April... march is gone...
---
Classic wow was already multi-threaded.  There was a giant clusterfuck with the first HT intel CPUs as Blizzard was assigning threads based on LogicalCPUID#, which would result in 2-4 threads being ran on 2 cores + 2HT instead of 4 Cores + 0 HT.
---
This was BC/Wrath era iirc.
---
I don't know enough about the situation to speculate.  For the most part unless something is really game breaking, we wanted to let players play the way they want
---
Totally unplayable
---
I wonder if Classic will release alongside 8.2.
---
The eye was like 400-800g on my server.
---
I’ll miss you all too! I’ll likely have an alt - maybe a twink!
---
FOOL WHY WOULD YOU TELL EVERYONE!
---
Quite common overall. Every priest in my guild have it. It’s not difficult to obtain if you are in a progression guild.
---
Silent bid, zero-sum is the best system I have ever used and defeats loot council, EPGP, and all the rest.
---
I do think those guys got popped nearly as much.  Maybe sometimes but may have had more to do with being in connection with where the gold went.  It's possible they knew how to work around us for the most part.  They also had an advantage in talking, so people were way more likely to report a bot than someone they thought was a real person, even if they were a farmer.
---
It depends. If the item dropped was specific for the quest and the quest alone, then yes, everyone in the party could loot it. For example, the Defias letter dropped by Van Cleef in deadmines. But, if it's for a quest AND is just regular loot, such as the boat meat you mentioned, then it's one per kill and given to the first person who looted it. 
---
Makes westfall an absolute joy to quest in!
---
this is so accurate its sad for our entire species.
---
Being a current sub bears 0 impact on getting beta access. It’s all luck of the draw. If a beta does happen, good luck gents. 
---
Make sure your beta settings are up to date and you’ve checked the box to show interest in WoW betas.
---
I got into the legion beta without an active sub. Don't spend your money
---
I remembed back in wrath i got permabanned fof verbal abuse... That took multiple gms huh
---
Whatever plugs your butt my dude
---
I took the gamble. Now I’m married to a Puerto Rican
---
This is EXACTLY why i am doing no preparations. I dont know if im going horde or alliance, what class im going to play what what professions im going to pick. What areas to quest in what the best builds are etc. I want the game experience for me to be new and fresh so i can ENJOY playing the game like when it first came out. I feel like preplanning every level is going to ruin the fun for me. Just sayin..
---
Show me a guild that used dkp to give tfury away and I'll show you a true dkp guild and a terrible guild at the same time.
---
Can't you get them low then burst then in a fear-&gt;silence? I would think imp inner fire would be better for dealing with melee
---
That's crazy, anyway you can farm it 2man really easily and it takes like 1-2 hours to get one, which is about 50g/hour the "standard g/hr", people on pservers know you can farm it so it's never that expensive, and probably won't be on classic either(unless if droprate is changed different).
---
Perfection.
---
I have one account, who else do you think I am?
---
I would say so yes, the levelling in current wow is better than a year ago (at least you don’t get kicked out of a zone for levelling too fast) but it’s not engaging.
---
As a starter player I would suggest classic. If you want a more linear experience retail is better.
---
Haha! That is hilarious though. "No I will not heal, but I will use these bandages."
---
Booooring
---
Potential geared tanks because fuck naxx.  
---
  Guilds will try to steal tanks from each other because it's hard to have/find EIGHT fucking geared tanks.  
---
  Healers are always needed.    
---
  Warlocks and actually good hunters are also hard to find.
---
Is this a credible source? And if so, why would blizzard let the date to be discovered like that? Legit question.
---
Gnome mage, I am just super excited to deck out my little guy in a wizard hat and sell portals to people. Also pvp because my friends want to alot of world pvp. I have always played on a pvp server so I dont really mind tho I hope the ganking isnt too bad.
---
This. And they're generally very pleasant people to group with, moreso than the people who know everything about the game and take things way too seriously. I onlt remember a few times when someone has been willingly stupid.
---
Why does the copyright only go to 2018? Is that normal?
---
I'd have guessed Kara.
---
I don't know how many hours I got in vanilla (think I remember 120 days so around 2800h) but I think it would be great to have people that played in vanilla beta test it since it could help them with recreating it more accurately.
---
Undead Warlock PvE EU
---
holy shit fam
---
Competent healers. Also warlocks because super strong in late vanilla, but honestly anything can be played as long as you're competent. I'd take someone who tries hard and can manage threat over someone who goes ham and dies every fight. If you're competent a guild will take you, period. Attrition happens and even if you're on the bench at the start they'll bring you more often than not once they realize your potential.
---
It seems you want to be a core raider. Show up on time in a pve spec and you will be ahead of the pack already.
---
The date of patch delivery isn't exactly a secret.  Its listed in the CDN's config record.  April 17 2019 was yesterday... i.e. the date it got pushed up to the network.
---
Mess around on a race/faction that you're not likely to play when it comes out, and leave your planned experience unspoiled.
---
In the past, WoW betas have been between 3-6 months.
---
But Classic isn't a typical beta. There aren't new features/raids/dungeons or anything like that to test. It's just a matter of everything running properly/accurately, and there is an internal environment to compare it to, so it makes it that much easier.
---
I'd be incredibly surprised if it lasted more than 2 months...and if I had to bet money, I'd wager 6 weeks.
---
But there is no way to really gauge it. It's not a typical beta. Hell, the demo for it wasn't typical.
---
I'll be sitting in my green quest gear complaining about all these damn epic geared no lifers that spend more time in game then I do.
---
My uncle works at Nintendo and he said this is BS.
---
Blizzard accepts that people know how, but according to the guy who runs the [bnet.marlam.im](https://bnet.marlam.im) site, they frown on people advertising the "how".  I imagine it involves making the right calls with the right POST data to the server in a way that makes the server believe you're a legitimate [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) Agent.
---
i.e. Not something you want everyone doing.
---
He and the tank were friends, and joined the queue together, so we couldnt tell him to leave or else we wouldn't have a tank. He basically just acted as a fourth DPS, and a shit one at that. I just left the dungeon half way through after dying for the 3rd time.
---
Oof, Paladin has a reputation for noob-friendly, but I disagree.  
---
A bad paladin can be spotted from miles away.
---
Paladin leveling is slow and frustrating solo.  There are yellow level mobs you cannot solo unless you know the ins and outs of agro, spell casting and interupting, and burst.
---
Duo leveling will be fine, but I suspect we will see a lot of people with 'Paladin Fever', who regret it at 60.
---
Paladin at 60 is very similar to hunter in that a bad paladin can scrape by, but a good paladin will contrast so heavily that it can cause negative reputation towards the newbie paladin.
---
TL;DR fire up WireShark
---
Lots of people want mages because they think they shit gold, but a lot are turned away from pve because they don't like the simple rotations. So it ends up not being as difficult to get a spot as you may think. 
---
Horde side, I don't think we ever turned away a good resto shaman. And later on geared hunters are harder to find.
---
Yes, they said exactly this.
---
However people saw that the demo was 7.3.5 and declared that "Classic will use the Legion client". You try explaining to them how software development works. :)
---
Ok, so this date(bottom left corner of the screenshot) represents the date when the Beta was pushed into the CDN, is that correct?
---
Yeah in vanilla people just jumped randomly and landed out of melee range. Then part of vanilla there were times when you would intercept past the target in slow mo lmfao.  
---
I wish charge worked properly in actual vanilla.
---
If I get an invite, absolutely. I'll just play the opposing faction and a class I'm not going to play on release.
---
Remember that it's a beta, not a demo. You're expected to actually try and break things, not just have fun playing the game and ignoring anything that might be an issue.
---
🙂
---
*Smashes chair with a vending machine*
---
They are charging you significantly less if you adjust for inflation.
---
Draw distance will be fixed to the maximum Vanilla limit.
---
THANK YOU N*STALRIUS!
---
Depends. An “old-school” closed beta typically lasts at least six months and can often last a year.
---
A modern marketing beta can last as little as a few days to a couple of weeks.
---
F
---
I will only use it to look around a do a few quests. I would mostly use it to configure my game client so come launch I can start playing and not having to setup my UI/chat windows.
---
I am not gonna do actual gaming. I will save that for the real deal.
---
Look at you all hyping about beta for a 15 y.o game, F\*\*\* beta ... who would be stupid enough to go get burnt out grinding to 60 on a character that'll get deleted once classic launches? wtb classic launch already.
---
MY BETA INVITATION SETTINGS!! Holy moly, thank you for reminding me. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
In the "Restoring History" panel at Blizzcon they went on about how individual lamp post light colors will be fixed. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM)
---
I'm pretty sure they won't forget the weather. :) (And if *somehow* they do, it's a bug, which should be brought to their attention and fixed.)
---
And you are stupid if you think that if they did anything but this they would not get a community backlash. They understand what we want, they are viewing this as a museum piece, they want to as faithfully as possible recreate the original game. They are changing spell batching which most of us thought there was no chance of them doing. That has shown a level of dedication to replicating the original that has assured the reasonable elements of this fandom that we are truly getting the original game as much as possible. They have even revised content release plans to please the fans further. What more evidence do you need.
---
if rogues are bothering you then go with either dwarf or orc hunter. out of your choices, frostmage works well too.
---
mates want to go horde, but I really cba.  
---
currently I am dead set on going alli as a female human rogue on a PvP server.
---
What is the first one of? Reminds me of the cliff sides of Westfall?
---
Oh you...
---
&gt; I'd say the least played classes are warlock
---
Really? I thought WL was pretty popular because of how easy it is to level and the "free" mount at 40.
---
Just wondering..how do you see this as negativity? Im just looking for discussion.
---
/a
---
You are correct, this was possible early vanilla.
---
The 'bug' was that Out-of-range auto attacks would keep you in-combat.  Then you just had to use Bloodrage (or whatever it was called) on cooldown to build rage without OOC rage loss.
---
I'm reading about Horde needing Hunters... can anyone explain? Back in the days I remember the game being swamped with Hunters on Horde side :D
---
If anything, I have noticed that you get a better chance if you were NOT subbed.
---
I remember getting Legion beta key while my active subbed friends didn't and they were mad.
---
Just a theory, it could have been a way to advertise the expansion and suck me back into it.
---
That said, I am very sure that an active sub will not increase your chances to obtain a beta key.
---
He literally just explained you trick the system into thinking you're a b.net client trying to download the game the normal way.
---
Seeing comments about how BG's were only 5-10 servers and only NA.  Here are the facts - https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Battlegroup
---
BG's were a lot more than 10 and both NA and EU.
---
As a Druid I'm going to rush for my Bear Form.
---
I hate leveling as Balance. :(
---
Can't blame the guy. I'm also losing my mind waiting for classic.
---
So, mine and herb while leveling, stockpile the orse for engi, then what about the herbs? Sell them?
---
It does actually makes sense to get the mount first, getting from point A to point B quicker will speed up everything. But still I get the impression from people that attunements are a must plus the quest chains go through dungeons that drop the BiS, si they are very tightly connected.  If I do attunements first this means I will be passivly farming BiS gear as well. Just not sure how to combine this with gold making, I cant play 10 hours a day. At best 3 maybe 4, weekends more.
---
How's this for concise: there's no beta.  No one has an answer to your hypothetical question about a nonexistant beta.  Just fucking chill until a Beta is announced; if one is, then your question will be answered.
---
But seriously, $15 (£8.99 for me) really isn’t that much. Ill put more time into wow classic than time I spend listening to Spotify or watching TV. ( cable bundles are extortionate, never mind Netflix, prime, nowtv etc...)
---
If however, the server quality begins to lack and the support starts to fade, their would be an argument as to how the sub fees are used/allocated. Maybe this should be a real concern, how will blizzard support classic following its launch?
---
When your game is so hyped people hack into your network to try and see the game early lmao
---
Are you able to see which Addons we are using? Could you pin down if a technical problem was likely coming from an AddOn we are using?
---
What did the UI look like? was it very office-y excel sheik or world of warcraft UI themed? is this like a secret blizzard achievement page on blizz’s side?
---
As people have already said, the price doesn't online include Classic, it's for live too. I hope they release another subscription were I can pay something like 7$ to play only classic, that'd be fair.
---
Nah, you misunderstood. PvP during RP is great, let enemy faction players interfere; I don't mind. I don't want to be interfered by players from my own faction, which is much more likely to happen on a PvP realm.
---
We will know if they're doing 1.12 itemization for sure
---
I could understand the clientside cracking part of it obviously but how the fuck did he even download the client to begin with? I'm guessing an insider at blizzard slipped him a copy or he somehow got into the blizzard servers and downloaded it.
---
Good man! Go forth and Frost things to death!
---
When the Classic WoW demo first came out, I noticed something was off with the sound.
---
I watched some videos of the login screen. Below I give you three links - of the original version, a private server version, and the classic demo version.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE5oaOOwInE&amp;t=43s
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFXoN6q75NQ&amp;t=54s
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VW_VWat4lI&amp;t=30s
---
If you adjust the sound level to be equal you can still notice how crisper, clearer and fuller the original version sounds.
---
I want to know whether you noticed the difference and if so, how do you feel about it ?
---
This is, in my view, very important as the music of Vanilla was half the experience, and tampering with it is worse than changing a few items.
---
Thoughts?
---
I’m sure there’s some nice horde people, but I’m ally to put an end to every edgy undead rogue griefer at 60. My duty as a night elf warrior is to body them with a Charge when they open up on a lowbie and send them back to the crypt. 
---
Tl;dr Protector roleplay
---
┬┴┬┴┤ ͜ʖ ͡°) ├┬┴┬┴ im waiting for you Blizzard
---
spirit and mp5 is a thing, and totem twisting will seperate great from good. greatness comes from knowing when to twist as opposed to withold for mana efficiency.
---
Sorry wait what? I'm at work now and went out last night so I haven't kept up for 24 hours. There's a beta?!? Is this real?
---
Because it’s copyrighted 2004
---
Now because they “remastered it they are probably going legal check if they can change it to 2019-2034”    It here is a problem that the old content is not copyrighted anymore.  (Disney tried to remaster and got booted down for it if I don’t remember it wrong so it might be cr free).
---
It's Reddit. Things are reposted a billion times and only the bitter veterans of the subreddit will react. With downvotes.
---
What you talk about has been discussed into the ground. Also, on first glance, most people will just see it as "bashing retail".
---
Finally, there is no "community". Just a lot of people, with different opinions. You got a few downvotes and a few comments, not all dismissive. I recon this is all what could be expected for this topic, don't take it hard. ;)
---
That's not how you pronounce it
---
It’s publicly available on the CDN
---
There is a test of it being away called Phase 1
---
Yep, it did for me. XIV turned to literal repetition from dailies weeklies to patch cycles and even expansions. I’m coming home.
---
Pretty sure they base it on metrics like play time and classes used as well.  Often times the beta access from the random public seems to be the types of players they cannot find en-masse from the well-known players.
---
Actually, it **technically** represents the date it was built.  But since the broken build went up on the 17th, and the fix to that also went up on the 17th it means that it was rebuilt on the 17th too.
---
I wouldn't mind beta testing this. I've had my account since vanilla, have 14 or 15 120's, and sit around in boralus a lot. I work overnight so it's tough to do stuff with my guild, hence the altoholic status lol. I'd definitely put some time into some beta action when my guildies go to sleep
---
There's a tool for that but sadly it also unsubscribes you from all the other good games too.
---
It's worth pointing out that previous expansions are 100% new content, unlike classic. So hopefully alot less time xD
---
And a bit more.  You have to know how to simulate the authentication handshake such that you are posting them legitimate session tokens etc.
---
Yep. I am planning not to have any alts this time. Hopefully I will succeed.
---
Indeed they have! :P
---
Damnit, who let the Naga eat the Kiwis again?
---
Merc out
---
I love him.
---
Sham and locks
---
It seems like Blizzget already does all the work but the classic wow beta branch doesn’t show up
---
Yet
---
Disenchant yourself
---
It was $15 then, and it’s $15 now. #nochanges
---
Ooo well played
---
Did you get a [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) Agent update?
---
&gt; You try explaining to them how software development works. :)
---
I tried. It was basically impossible and people became very angry.
---
Will of the forsaken is cited as a reason why warlocks are thin on alliance.
---
Simple yes and no question at login.
---
"Are you a bad tester?" 👍
---
Oh, forgot that one. Thanks
---
You forget you can group up and complete the quest together right?
---
Yeah I don't really know what to make of it because OP then mentions the hierarchy as being agent -&gt; senior -&gt; lead -&gt; something else, not agent -&gt; senior -&gt; manager -&gt; lead.
---
"Ops Lead" as a senior role above "Team Lead" is a thing in some CS companies, but I have never heard of managers being below any kind of lead.
---
That's weird, you'd think they would only allow blizzard ip addresses to access it, well shit.
---
Enjoy your vindication. :)
---
A fellow troll shaman, may your walks for the water totem be short and swift.
---
Yeah sorry I meant FR-localized clients, presumably DE too
---
It’s intentionally available, they have to put the game in a place where people can download it from their infrastructure at some point, it makes sense from a software perspective to do that first and make sure it’s right. No one can log in, either way. 
---
The current method of downloading it from them is a bit hacky and in a grey area so I wouldn’t encourage it but it’s only something blizz would come down on if it was something everyone started doing
---
I really doubt the Classic beta will be as long as expansion pack bets tests. They don't have to test the content. They just have to test if everything works like it did back in Vanilla. 1-2 months will easily suffice.
---
What’s interesting is the version numberings.
---
Wow classic is 1.13.0.28377, wow classic beta is 1.13.2.30073.
---
The wow classic is what we got for the demo.
---
Which means they’ve moved up 2 patch versions since then internally.
---
&lt;major version&gt;.&lt;minor version&gt;.&lt;patch version&gt; is normally how it works
---
I’d kill to see patch notes!
---
I hope this will be the case.
---
=(
---
As much as you might hate it, giving streamers access allows for free marketing for them. So don’t be shocked if most streamers get a key. I also want in the beta but I realize it’s apart of life. Hand out keys to streamers, they play it and the game gets in front of a lot of people.
---
I wonder how beta invites will work? Will they only send invites to people actively subbed to WoW retail? Will they announce an opt in, for even unsubbed players? I hope the latter.
---
Hm? Blizzget is a third party tool
---
So in localized EU clients (French that I know of for sure, maybe others), the unit used for spell range is listed as meters instead of yards. Just word replacement, no conversion.
---
Makes total sense in retrospect, would have been weird to see "27.4 meters range".
---
As a priest you will get it if your guild runs MC. The only question will be how quickly you will get it depending on the priority you will have compared to your priest brothers. If you want to get it sooner, turn up ready and prepared to every raid and you will be one of the first in the guild. Back in the day I think I got it within 4 resets of clearing MC, I was third after the guild master who was a priest. Even bottom of the list as long as you are in the raids you will get it within 3/4 months.
---
It is on private server, but i dont think its far off. Since ppl can get exalted in darnassus around 42-44 level range. And revered is bit under half way to exalted.
---
But it does require that you do (at max level 5 ALL of darnassus quests, from the starting zone). If you do them later, you get only small part of the rep.
---
Na wait for overpower to proc and save you
---
Agree!
---
Nah, there's no say to connect, or even know if the servers are up. What's happened is that people with the technical know how can manually download the client from Blizzard's CDN (Content Delivery Network).
---
Fair point, but I would still argue that its a better outcome
---
Jesus
---
Hey, what's the formula of love?
---
This is a result of private servers and classes have been figured out. Hunters are good tier 1 / 2, but then they fall off compared to other classes.
---
Many people will probably still have a hunter as a farm character though.
---
Oh sorry misread.
---
Hello,
---
I heard that GMs also used their break time to have fun ingame by testing spells which are not available for the players. 
---
Is that true?
---
I completely agree. That's what I was hinting at. (As usual, sarcasm doesn't translate well into writing.)
---
What's are your top 3 most used GM commands?  
---
Also, did you ever mess with other GMs?
---
At that stage... ZG and AQ20, theres like 3-4 (?) months between ZG and AQ20 release. At AQ20 release you obviously have c'thun neck, thats just bit better version of ossarian neck.
---
So yes, ossarian neck is better than ZG neck. But thats much later in progression. And since ossarian neck is a q, its very easy to get. Guaranteed drop every time.
---
I wouldn't call hunter intense but rather intricate as it mostly comes down to timing. You're not really mashing buttons which seems what op is looking for.
---
Oh man that feeling of getting your bear form for the first time after 10 levels of moonfire-wrath-wrath-hit with staff because you’re now OOM is one of the best feelings in the game.
---
Oh, I see. My bad. :)
---
They actually removed the old player models a few years back and removed the toggle. Not sure what else they removed.
---
And thats why i said that playing in private server to meet and see the players INGAME is the only option at this point.
---
Female orc Warlock on a PVP server.
---
PvP server because I always was on PvP servers.
---
Horde because I always played Alliance on retail and I want to experience the "other side"
---
Warlock because I mained Lock on retail the last few exp. Want to see the Classic version of it!
---
Twink will be a Alliance Warrior. Dont know which race yet tho. Prop either Dwarf or Nelf :)
---
even if someone data mined it and the client had all the wow token stuff \ mount shop and lfg \ lfr like blizz is still actively working on the client.
---
tbh i would be surprised if there is not a few things somewhere in the client they are testing the waters with
---
You missed one (two actually)
---
Vanilla Open Beta : 14 days
---
Vanilla Closed Beta : Roughly a year.
---
TBF this was a good fix for retail wow. 
---
People were out-leveling zones so it made it redundant to do questing to level up. 
---
It also means that a player can choose their own route to level which is pretty good. 
---
Glad Vanilla is designed so that you don't need this to quest tho.
---
Back in the day it would be exciting but in today’s climate people will just rage and quit the game if you do this to them.
---
I seem to remember they explicitly saying that it'll be fixed because of that's what provides the proper (intended) ambience of the world.
---
In any case in the Blizzcon demo there was no draw distance slider even though you could change plenty of other settings (so it was deliberately removed).
---
Hey Lashhi,
---
I cover all the weird/hard specs out there and talk about the details that go into them on my stream. Rogue-wise there is rogue tank which get your blood pumping as u need to intensively pay attention to manage threat and survival. Otherwise, there is priest tank which combines two types of entirely different spells and has +6 spells.
---
I can talk thoroughly talk about everything that I mentioned, just let me know if you are interested.
---
They said the demo still had work. Hopefully this was one of them.
---
Hi, /u/Soapstility
---
Vanilla open beta was 14 days.
---
I like emojis, ironical or not :/
---
It was just too painful to have up there on the list.. Too long :(
---
I've been subbed since 2004, and been invited to every Beta from TBC on. And WoD, Legion and BFA Friends and Family.
---
I don't know if it's the sub but I'd hope they'd consider me a friend at least by now.
---
I have $100 riding on it being a paid beta test at least initially 
---
Blizz loves money and all they need to do is throw a pack together with a pet and a month of game time on release 
---
Considering you only need a sub to play its very likley going to be a paid to test for us model with some open beta stress test weekend at some point. 
---
I would prefer it just open to everyone so they can catch as many bugs as possible , especially exploits , people are less likley to try and exploit on a paid account, i have some concerns about dupe type exploits effecting wow
---
Though I am also happy to support this release which is something i would not expect to ever say about a blizzard release again
---
It’s gonna be a pretty long beta if people find a colossal amount of mistakes and bugs like they did in the demo. My gut tells me they will.
---
Hopefully it doesn't get released until late August. Too many kiddies going to play if it's June.
---
So they will leave. It is not important for us. The goal is the fun of the hunt. Making noobs rage is something i love.  We are not playing on Classic and doing a whole new progression through it just to pve once more time all the raids. This time is for blood.
---
Forgetting that majordomo didnt have the chest at launch ? It was added in later patch, meaning the quest line might come in stage 2.
---
I highlighted the open beta because I think that'll be the length of the beta for Classic.
---
Warlocks on Alliance side. They’re very scarce but needed. 
---
Other than dps, any healer or tank is always very wanted. Roll a Dwarf Priest or Resto Shaman and you can join any guild you want.
---
Undead, can't decide between Priest or Rogue who should be first (I will make other as my alt). I mained both in vanilla - wotlk, Priest for raiding and Rogue for PvP. I'm looking forward to trying Horde as I've always been Alliance and it will be fun to try the other side!
---
PvP server because I have some friends who are set on it.
---
&gt; I started with Legion. I never played Classic, or any expac aside from Legion and BFA.    
---
I fucking love the way my character grows stronger in Classic and in TBC 
---
What...
---
Pretty sure there will be PvE servers, most people not interested in PvP like me will just go there to avoid people who enjoy ganking.
---
I totally misread your comment, I thought it said Beta - and Release date about a year later. My bad.
---
You will sit in a puddle of your own piss and you will damn well like it
---
Holy shit!
---
Honestly from what I've seen on pserv, you combat stance to charge then berserk for the duration of the fight. 
---
And even admitting you stance dance a 10x à fight, its just one more button to push to use the spell you want. 
---
I'm talkin about pvp. It is way overrated, warlock for example has to be extremely precise with pet management and has a fair number of macros to dispel him or ally or ennemies, kick at the right time etc
---
I think youre way cooler than retailers
---
i cant decide between troll or undead either for pvp priest. I think im leaning towards undead
---
Pretty much everyone who have limited time to play and care about progression should go to a regular server. Then again you can also grief there as you can shutdown quest hubs of the opposing faction and so on.
---
Jesus Christ I haven't seen &lt;and two stealthed rogues&gt; in a long, long time
---
That "guild" existed on every server and they all claimed to be the first
---
Did anyone you played with know you were a GM?
---
I am guessing private servers .... but that is a lot of playtime if starting late in legion to experience that + BFA + private server classic + private server TBC.  But who am I to judge ... I played a shit ton in the past too.
---
I was in your boat but have decided on Troll for PVP. The three charges of Shadowguard give a 30% chance of proccing blackout on a rogue that jumps you and even though Undead's devouring plague is strong on paper it costs a ton of mana, a fifth of alliance will stoneform out of it immediately and priests/palas will just dispel it whenever they smell it on anyone.
---
He's still my best bud after all these years! He's had some right zingers in that time
---
People keep asking "Why would you speed level in classic?" This is one of the reasons.
---
I agree, I just don't see the appeal in killing defenseless players so personally I never gank. Obviously there will be griefing on PvE aswell, but I think it's a price worth paying to avoid getting ganked by high levels.
---
The maps I'm refering to are the 'Emerald Dream' and the 'StormwindPrison'. I think it's especially interesting that they included the former, as it was scrapped during the development process in OG Vanilla according to John Staats.
---
I think there's an invisible wall blocking that option. You'd have to remove that wall by changing data
---
Yeah, but it's still interesting to know it can be done
---
Why will there be sharding? Sharding would ruin so much of the experience for me. Lag and chaos is suppose to be there on a launch, people queueing for questitems and finding their first friends on the server! So much fun imo.
---
One. Who hurt you?
---
Two. Seriously i know autism is used as an insult but not even autistic people would stoop to something like this. 
---
This is called griefing and pretty sure it would get you morons banned.
---
someone wna swap classic beta key w eso elsweyr beta!? keklol
---
Interesting to see that the client is in 64 bit. Very excited to see how smooth everything is migrated to the updated client.
---
No, you won't hit 60 in less than a week.
---
The way classic worked is that there was a variety of servers.  This server was one of the ones released with the AQ patch.  They were strange as some high end guilds moved to them for server queue reasons, and others moved to them for 'big fish, little pond' reasons.  These servers were lower population and often lagged progression for this reason (eq AQ war effort on a server with 100 60s).
---
Orc urine is an aphrodisiac
---
i never said i don't want classic, i am not even playing retail, i unsubbed 2 months into bfa because it's not fun anymore and i am waiting for classic, it's just funny how people think that classic is harder,  i for example am not looking for difficulty in classic, i am looking for the mmo in mmorpg
---
I'll bring my main
---
oh wait
---
please don't gank me
---
Then don't play, we will not miss you
---
Can you find those for sale?
---
I dont think thete will be instant 60 servers since questing is such a big part of classic. They need every, or almost every, quest to be tested.
---
\&gt;  we'll all hit 60 in less than a week. 
---
Yeah, right.
---
All you can do is make sure your beta preferences on you battle.net account are ticked.
---
It's worth considering his advice, but remember many of the best tanks in vanilla definitely didn't consider it a must-have.
---
Yes, but they've been working on the beta files for months. I highly doubt they'd upload it on battlenet openly if their intent for a beta wasn't there.
---
Too soon, Executus.
---
Honestly with classic I wouldn't mind a rocky start. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that people get to play on tuesdays now.
---
Don't be so cynical. They know they're going to make enough money off classic, there's no need to try and squeeze more from people by making them pay for beta. 
---
Besides, blizz usually does random selection for betas iirc.
---
You're mistaken. There is not going to be any rebalance at all.
---
Hey man if they rolled on a PvP server they better be prepared for toxic human behavoir.
---
They don't go anywhere, they're just invisible to players.
---
Nah I know but it's running on retail client so the "disabled" data might be :)
---
Those maps are also in 8.2.0 PTR.
---
Ezpz if you can push past all the casuals and even more ez if you're a hunter.
---
 Im not sure I’ll even bother with the beta,  I don’t want to spend time levelling for no reason. If it was instant 60 I’d be all over it, just to bash out some pvp without getting too attached.
---
It depends what they need to test/look at I guess
---
I think it's most likely that classic gets delayed. They are far behind on modern wow's release schedule and I bet that they planned to have a little less content in summer and release classic because of that. Now that they're behind they have classic planned for summer (when 8.2 will drop most likely) and their new content at the same time.
---
It was a thing in vanilla but it got fixed.
---
More like *how* did they do it. Have you seen their arms?
---
This is probably the exact reaction he's getting off to :P I never understood the toxicity tbh. Surely one can PvP without being a complete bell end about it.
---
I think they will test different level brackets as at different points in the beta. 1-20 week 1, 20-35 week 2, 35-50 week 3 and 50-60 week 4 so something like that, so that they will boost you to certain levels to ensure enough levels and quests are tested in all zones.
---
My only point to add is this: If you start with Vanilla, you'll start off from the beginning.. with retail I personally stopped playing at the end of the 2nd expac (Wrath of the Lich King) which was still relatively close to the original lore in terms of the characters involved and the storyline (Scourge etc etc). I haven't got a damned clue what's going on in the current version of retail where you got Horde Goblins, Alliance Werewolves and then Pandas as well as these extra classes like Monk and Demonhunter. I feel like so much has happened in that game (It has a 15 year history after all) that it would be really hard to get into now for me, let alone someone who is new to the entire series.
---
With classic, you can take it easy and explore the game at your own pace learning as you go. In terms of convenience and slow levelling, you won't know any different because you haven't played either version before. You get to learn more about your chosen class because you really have to play it, learning slowly as you go and you'll meet some great people along the way.
---
As a horde rolling on a pvp server I will continually /spit on every member of your guild at every opportunity. I encourage everyone else who is not a toxic douche bag to do the same
---
git gud
---
    git: 'gud' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
---
Because who doesn't want to me a giant axe wielding minotaur looking mofo?
---
I see, thank you. What makes this more complitaced is that now im thinking is warrior the right class for me after all or not.
---
No new copyrightble assets added this year (everything is either from 1.12 release or last year's bfa client)
---
They don't have to test the mechanics, for all the people wondering.  
---
  They have a client to compare to, a 1.12 client, with full access, as shown in the classic pannels.  
---
   Also doesn't matters how long or how little expansions were, this is not expansion, there's only reconstruction.  
---
  They can compare any number, any raid with the original client, they don't need to do a beta for this, this is a test for the servers, sharding, realms, etc.
---
Look away people, don't feed the troll.
---
Isn't prison just stockade?
---
Do you think you would have a better wage now if you had done something else at this time?
---
Warrior is really fun.  Think on it, but don't agonize! Druid is great if you are feeling like you may be conflicted.
---
I am expecting nothing more than 4 weeks.
---
I always thought it was in Azshara, where you could find the Archmage Xylem pre Catastrophe.
---
An older meme, nevertheless its perfekt.
---
Uh, no it ain't. It's called "life on a PVP server". 
---
If anything OP is actually encouraging the Alliance to come and help their comrades and promoting world PVP. It's a good thing. I'll be spending my downtime in Redridge camping campers and making lowbies safer, that's for sure. All in the game, yo.
---
I hope there will be instant 60 at some point in the beta, just to test some classes and how they work at level cap since I never played during Vanilla.
---
Having the unfinished zones, raids, dungeons and PvP BGs would be such an amazing damn thing for Classic.
---
We meet again...old friend.
---
Druid would be nice, but i don't really like them. Which is kinda sad, because i like stealthy thing, i like healing and melee combat, but i don't like playing a druid.
---
&gt; To others who will go in pve servers, have a nice time in your half-game.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bej6kz/horde_guild_to_make_alliance_progression_more/el68pyz/
---
&gt; We are not playing on Classic and doing a whole new progression through it just to pve once more time all the raids. 
---
Heh. I hope you too have a nice time in your half-game.
---
I once remember a GM showed himself to me, then he spawned around 10 chests for me to open. All of which contained 1 copper. Is this something you could/would do?
---
 Interesting azshara crater is PvPZone02.
---
And funny they misspelled Gnomeregan.
---
Not now, but i think they will do a PTR for stage patches and let people do raids to test them fully before launch.
---
That's gonna be insanely hard to pull off. That means barely any sleep for a week.
---
So mid June? Let's hope you're right
---
No. If you dont think its worth $15, then we dont need you there.
---
There are several servers to go "beta test" on right now. The official realms won't be much different, only slightly due to having all correct values. The overall experience of pri\*\*te servers is the same and chances are you've already tried it. So what exactly would you be missing out on? Spamming memes in /1?
---
I skipped Tauren because they ran slower.. atleast thats what me and my friends believed (no Tauren for us)
---
Yes there will probably also be the option to insta 60.
---
And progress is A L W A Y S wiped.
---
And i'll be happy to have your spit on me, while getting you're realm empty of Alliance noobs.
---
Sounds like you didnt play vanilla.
---
Beta is not for this kind of purposes.
---
I know what you mean, but beta testing is for testing mechanics and quest and all the things that lie's beyond that.
---
This is kind of a toxic douchebag thing to do.
---
No. This is not a Pserver. Don't even think about it. 
---
Also I don't think they need a Beta for testing raids, they can do it by their own dev team. Questing and leveling are much more important for Beta because there are a LOT of things  for testing.
---
They were in the original vanilla files too, no?
---
I want it so bad. Never got it in vanilla.
---
Only kill quests tho?
---
You can know something without having to experience it.  
---
  Do you think historians can't be experts on their field because they weren't there?
---
Those cheeky fellas will have to look for a new group if that happens :D
---
i wont play it. its like holding a nut, the longer u hold the better the release. ive waited this long, why would i spoil such a grand nut by not waiting another few more months. personally want even go near it. im happy its happening tho, so that the real game will be better
---
Everything can be group up and shared.
---
?
---
Beta is also meant to test skills, abilities, instanced battlegrounds and things like that, not just quests.
---
Agreed, and seeing everyone saying it's mandatory really pisses me off as a very successful Vanilla MT.
---
From their perspective you're paying 15 a month for classic and the current game. And they're a business, of course they're going to charge as much as they can. I don't think it's an outrageous price, especially since we haven't seen the product yet.
---
you are totally correct.
---
It's not necessarily 2 versions. Blizz usually only increments the first two, then they kinda wing it for the next ones.
---
Like there was 7.3.0 -&gt; 7.3.2 -&gt; 7.3.5
---
Did that for half a year already (guess how).
---
Found out I *love* the hunter because I get emotionally attached to the pet. I know the psychological mechanism behind it (you get attached *because* you have to  invest in it) and I know it's just an online NPC. But still, when levelling up playing solo, it's nice to have your buddy around sharing the moment with you.
---
Also, I love the way you have to take care of your pet, keep its abilities up to date, feed the little tamagotchi. I love the fact that I need to have ammo on me. Great class all around. Much more involved than retail hunter.
---
So, I got that bit sorted already. In the likely event that I'll not get a beta invite, I can happily wait for release.
---
You can opt in to all betas on the battle net website and you don’t need an active sub to be chosen. There are many factors that contribute to being chosen (like pc specs).
---
Why would anyone here give half a shit about what you do with your money?  
---
  If you're thinking about it, then decide by yourself reading up.
---
The game it self will play out as if it was patch 1.12, so far there have been no word about balance changes, additional content or anything. And that's nothing you shoud expect for atleast a few years.
---
But if they have to fix bugs or do some updates. They might have missed some functions and change them to the 1.12 version again, they still need to keep track of the current build version.
---
So it'll be 1.13.3, 1.13.4 etc. For internal documentation of which patch of classic it is. 
---
But the content, gameplay, balance etc will still remain as it was in 1.12.
---
You think DadActivision will ban people wpvping in a pvp server? You are the kind of target i'll enjoy the most. Go in half-game PvE realm.
---
i wont play it. its like holding a nut, the longer u hold the better the release. ive waited this long, why would i spoil such a grand nut by not waiting another few more months. personally wont even go near it. im happy its happening tho, so that the real game will be better
---
mages are not competitive in dps meters in MC and BWL when compared to other pures, well specifically warriors and rogues.
---
priest is most competitive meaning: they are more competitive on meters in their roll (healer) than druid is as a healer or mage as a dps. and yes they are competitive with paladin specially if using renew.
---
guilds don't take only 1 or 2 druids because its all they can find, its because they only need 1 to cast rejuvenation and buff and the remaining healer spots are better filled with priest, pally, shaman.
---
WORD
---
I’m rolling shadow and running as the only healer, but not telling you.
---
They will need all the people for server stressing. Bugs are most likely secondary here.
---
Expansion beta's have definitely not always been luck of the draw. Big streamers will always get an invite as well as high end raiders. For example, our guild formed in WoD and managed to kill Archimonde Mythic 1 week before Legion Alpha invites went out. All of us that were part of our first Archimonde kill got Alpha invites, whilst those who were benched or couldn't attend, did not. We have all since been invited to the BFA Alpha/Beta.
---
So whilst I think the majority of the invites are down to luck of the draw, there are still a large number of invites that are specifically targeted.
---
Now you can be hyped to play instead of struggle to tag intro quest mobs for 6 weeks to hit level 15
---
Why do I need to help beta test it again when I already beta tested it for 10+ years?
---
This is because you are a retailer. You will use questie because you dont do almost all quests several times. You wont know which quests to to and which one to skip to level up the quickest way. You will take you progression slowly and enjoy it. I hope you will. Getting level 60 in less than a week is more than possible even for a noob who just follow and good guide.
---
I thought this was the point. So they can support 2 games at the same time.
---
Stockades has its own entry.
---
Almost everyone at my school played horde, often the schools where either  horde or alliance. ^^
---
Luck of draw is fair but I think people who paid for the demo deserve to get in minimum.
---
as an mmo lets say if there was some sort of bugged quest that spat out good, or a dupe or some other exploit
---
its much much better if they catch that in a beta
---
blizzard knows mmo's pretty well as much as we want it asap i would just be prepared for an extended beta period
---
i think if the beta needs to go a little longer thats fine
---
My dad works for Nintendo.
---
MT in vanilla here.  If your dps does not have a main assist, rogue calling vanishes, etc then that's on them.  A tank's rotation is not hard abd what you are talking about with aggro is just bad dps to me.
---
Betas usually have a insta-max option. OP asked about the beta not the release
---
Which is a good thing because the files are almost 15 years old
---
No
---
I agree on this, I always though it was Scarlet Monastery.
---
What discord is that?
---
Hi, I can vaguely spot the difference. I assume the original one is the soundtrack version which is probably why it sounds better. The in-game versions are most likely lower bitrate versions to keep the game assets smaller.
---
That’s not really how it works.  You didn’t pay for a demo, you bought a virtual BlizzCon ticket. 
---
These are two separate things. 
---
Who knows, blizz could do that. It wouldn’t make any sense though and I wouldn’t hold my breath.
---
Guilds like this is the reason the biggest Servers here in Germany are Horde or Alliance only (Aegwynn Alliance, Blackrock Horde).
---
I mean if this is fun for you great, if you can get on the nerves that the other faction creates a anti guild to yours even better but it mostly ends (if your numbers is huge enough) in beein one of the 90% Horde to 10% Alliance ratio. HAve fun with you 2 hours BG queue
---
This is called dedication. Knowledge. Experience of progression. Bet you have nothing of those.
---
I have never received a beta invite from Blizzard while being signed up for all of them over almost 20 years now. Hope this changes this time.
---
On pservers charge works, in vanilla it didn't work. That's basically the difference.
---
I would if i would like playing them, but i don't like playing as druid
---
Prison was, I think, originally meant to be either
---
- The other castle island in the canals that you can't get to.
---
- The gated-off instance portal at the end of one of the canals that was never opened. People originally speculated it would be used for Guild housing.
---
i would not be surprised if they did something like this to make sure every zone gets looked at
---
i still feel like there is more testing to be done at 60 than at say 1-30
---
Thinking outside the box. You are my hero!

---
Introduction: If you're looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you're a PvE raider who's looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you're at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they're Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
What we are looking for: Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
What we are aiming for: Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
What we expect of members:
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids.
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
Our Raid Schedule: Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1.

extremely hyped.
---
John Staats (former WoW dev) confirmed it was intended to be for guild housing iirc.
---
This is from a private server rhyming with porthmail
---
chad-tier tbh
---
old Metallica makes me weep for what has been lost in time. The 1990's were a true test for metal. Some few became more metal, Metallica went AOR.
---
i always assumed kara
---
I played wow vanillas closed beta and it was progression and nothing like you say.
---
I know what you mean, I'm in the same boat. 
---
2 out of 3 things you want are available to rogues so this is your next best choice, alas it's pure dps only but the utility makes up for it easily.
---
Vanilla is a bit of rock paper scissors and warriors actually do stand a pretty decent chance versus a hunter because they can taunt the pet to cancel scatter and traps.
---
This sounds interessant. Even the name "vanguard" make me feel strange as it's the leading guild in the server i actually play. But people in this guild looks nice. We'll keep in touch.
---
Ez solution, invite no hunters to groups. Just like vanilla.
---
Can someone please explain the fastest way for a tauren to get to UD start?
---
I think it will be accessible early next week. They gonna wait until QA group will validate a build by passing regression tests and most of sanity tests. I think it will take 3-5 days to pass this. So my guess is a Tuesday next week.
---
Almost nobody raids on friday-saturday due ppl wanting to go out. Its mostly wed-thursday and sunday.
---
Dafuk, under 10 minutes. Not worth watching.
---
That's Medivh and it is Karazhan.
---
I don't think OP is going for "one of the most respected guilds". I think he wants infamy. Both are fine.
---
Ah the youtube greed, never changes.
---
No you didnt Cx
---
Its just that part of me wants to do a warrior, since thats what i played originally in vanilla. I also recently really have started liking healing. 
---
Why is this so hard, even when it should not be.
---
its not a huge surprise.
---
like when you take a retail client then essentially manually import all the vanilla assets you are still left with all the extra retail junk even though its not used.
---
I also believe wow has had unused maps from development included in the client since the earliest versions of wow
---
i forget the name of the yt channel but there was a guy who did history on some of the un released zones , like i think the map for an un used av style bg has been in the files forever
---
I was humbly hoping for a blue-post on my Birthday today!
---
Can’t wait to venture back into the real WoW with you all! &lt;3
---
Started following this sub recently for info as classic approaches , but damn colour me impressed by the memes coming out of the average user lol.
---
No its called: No job. Moms basement. Delivered food.
---
Cant make under a week with 5d played, playing 16h a day.
---
Hmmm. Out of curiosity, are you French?
---
Don’t be such a cuck.  You’re just like Phillip Scofield. “Who hurt you?”  Grow up
---
I hope they will be smarter and select among those who have vanilla accounts. We are the target audience, why they should share beta to retail users who joined later!?
---
Code Money like Fritos!
---
You’re doing Gods work son
---
Been playing private servers the last couple weeks and I’m enjoying every minute of it
---
Notre Dame didnt burn enough imo. And yes i leave in France.
---
Yeah all that is provided for the MT by the guild. It would be idiotic to make the MT farm that stuff themselves, that's just asking for the MT to burnout and screw over the guild.
---
Respect to those of you who will help with the development by playing the beta. Being egoistic, I don't really see the point of it. Would rather preserve my hype for the actual game.
---
Warrior/Druid/Rogue/Hunter with some variance depending on what you want to do.  
---
Warriors press lots of buttons in-combat, so do druids.  Rogues press lots of buttons outside of combat (stealth, sap, pickpocket, distract, etc).  Hunters are all around soloists and have less buttons overall but more chances to use them all.  Druids are similar, but with more specialized buttons.
---
Crap hope its in May. Right now I am on vacation abd near my PC... But for all of ypu I hope its sooner than expected. Damn I just had a little heart attack.
---
Common
---
Drops only drop for one party member in vanilla. So if you need goretusk livers I recommend not grouping.
---
Hope a open beta...
---
No worries about that. Always level on F R E S H overcrowned pvp private server. The key is to know you can level up with not a lot of energy. Sleep is not important at this phase.
---
 The best sound designers in the industry were working at Blizz during Vanilla. And you can really tell: all the sounds fit perfectly, nothing its too intrusive or tiresome or banging out loud and over produced as most of the sounds from recent games are. I really hope they will use the old sound data base.
---
were you jealous of players!?
---
The only time I’ve had beta invites is when I’ve been unsubbed (twice). But I have awful luck with closed beta codes in general!
---
&gt;  it makes sense from a software perspective to do that first and make sure it’s right.
---
You mean to tell me they didn't go into the basement, dust of 15 year old computers, and turn them back on`?
---
It may be the truth. In this case we'll be the king of a ghost realm. But i hope people will have a fighter spirit and some fraternity. And high level wont let the levelers feed our toxicity without doing anything.
---
It says nothing. Just wait patiently for the release date, you won't make it come faster. Go be busy with other things, and it will come faster that way, without talking and thinking about it every day.
---
We are not looking for respect as you say. We want to enter oggrimar and be spit on.
---
Agreed. It's a rest for sharding and hopefully how the zones once you get to where sharding stops
---
I feel so too. Thanks to say it.
---
I once got a ban during an arena match. The gm didn't event wait for it to end and fucked my mate's match too and instagave the win to the opposite team.
---
\+1 internet
---
But Pserver are mostly wrong about anything, respawn, mana healt regen, drop chances, pathfinding, aggro (ohh boy some Servers are so bad) and so on.
---
Playing the beta can be a good way to see how Vanilla really was back then (because blizz has the original data) and to not burn you out you could play Classes or races you never want to play when it releases.
---
OMFG I FORGOT ABOUT THIS
---
1st wipe in a dungeon:
---
"guys my gear is red"
---
&gt;Nice photoshop
---
this fakenews generation who dont even look up to the facts....
---
not public by any means, just a data mining clue
---
huuuuuuuuge........tracts of land ;)
---
If she doesn't have crazy eyes and a massive rack, count me out
---
Do you play EVE by any chance? Anyway, this sounds fun.. I wish I could join, but I just don't have the time to take of work in order to level to 60 ASAP :/
---
Dont think this is a problem for folk rolling on a PVP server. Its part of the game mechanics.  Good luck and Go Horde!!! :)
---
be teh change you wish to see in the world!
---
GIVE ME
---
Farm Righteous Orbs by chain running SM (you might need the [flameshield](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1168) for this as warrior to make the speed worth it).  
---
Farm [Eye of Shadow](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18665).
---
gud bot.
---
Thank you!  I had been looking for that first one for a while.
---
They have this at the library of Congress :) looked at it when they announced classic for nostalgia. (The book was in German I think)
---
You and your irl buddies are awfully triggered by this it seems. Yes daddyvison will absolutely ban someone for griefing (I’d reported by the griefees enough). Killing the same person 5+ times in a row is griefing and not in the spirit of the game. Good luck though
---
I possibly or it could be one of those scenarios where they add the chest at launch.
---
Prison is the "other" dungeon like the Stockades in the other tower. It's a full dungeon layout. I got ported there by a GM on a PS once when the world servers were down.
---
I believe it was originally going to be a higher level dungeon but got scrapped since it would be unfair for Alliance to have 2 dungeons in their "main" city.
---
you are like the evil twin version of my planned 26/25/0 pala haha.  all the spell damage+healing but with a big meaty 2h weapon that has some kind of proc that scales
---
i'll be able to stand there heal-turreting in pvp and then after being beat on by rogues and hunter pets i can turn and do a reck bomb for like 2-3k damage every now and then.  I cant wait
---
MVP! You found it, thank you!
---
I vaguely remember doing this in AQ20, and letting the tank max out rage before starting  Kurinnaxx. Despite being an obvious bug, I thought it made for fun gameplay.
---
blessing of protection on the tank 0:)
---
We need to talk more about guild policy. don’t know yet. we are maybe on discussion to join a HC raiding guild with some friends of private serv.. and being the leaders of the ganking team
---
Cuck is the siren call of people who have been hurt and have issues. You are super cool when you use that word lol.
---
*snaps*
---
Not sure what it will be yet. You’ll recognize us if you see us ingame.
---
Ah this must have been it. Bloodrage + 'no rage loss bug' to slowly build up to max.
---
I keep seeing this meme but have yet to see it in practise
---
Imagine getting butthurt about being ganked on a PvP server.  This game clearly isn’t for you buddy, I’d suggest you go play BFA where you can toggle war mode on and off for your delicate soul
---
You are presuming that there will be no time between the beta finishing and the game launch. July is more likely than June I think.
---
yeah im prettu sure they just coppied the vanilla files into the retail directory and said replace when windows asked
---
no real need to have a propper testing beta or anything its not like any bugs have ever effected the wow economy
---
I'm not playing on pservers either (anymore) for the same reason. 
---
But it's true, it would maybe be a good way to test a bit before launch to get a feel for what to expect. But I won't sub for it.
---
You’d be the king of nothing and hilariously would have nobody to gank if that were the case
---
If one person kill the same 5+ it may be. But we won’t do it. We’ll camp in group. Organizing our zone teams to rotate for not being bored. No worries. We know.
---
I agree its griefing but it will never be banned. BC portal was camped constantly on my server so sometimes you couldn't even progress to Hellfire and had to log off, and it was never punished. If you write blizzard their response will be "dont play on a pvp server if you dont like it"
---
These guys are truly the superior human species.
---
I love the Calling Countdown music. Gets me hyped
---
Troll Mage and Tauren Druid.
---
Makes no difference to me if he is a troll or not because I’m just trying to delay the inevitable of going to sleep and bs’ing on reddit
---
Really? Hunters? I was going to roll alliance hunter, but if I can be a wanted hunter on the horde side, I guess i can be an orc or troll
---
Where did I ever say I was upset about getting ganked? Right I didn’t lol
---
It will still be faster as you have more people who can tag mobs as they spawn.
---
Realm will be empty after naxx progression. They will be empty if pvpers find bg queue to long and reroll on another. There are tons of reason to see a realm die. Be prepared for some drama.
---
Sitting does not increase mana regen
---
Which will get you banned.
---
This reminds me of our private server raid yesterday. Priest died in BWL trash pack for some reason. He was ressed and he popped rune straight away to get mana back (we tend to go quite fast, money isnt the issue with him etc).
---
Ofc he died, again. Oh the laughs in discord.
---
So for 15 dollars I can either buy a large pizza and a big Coke or I can play a game I love. The choice is easy for me.
---
&gt;This is because you are a retailer
---
&gt;You will take you progression slowly and enjoy it
---
Pick one.
---
Where did I ever complain about being on the receiving end of games? Oh right I didn’t lol. Enjoy seal clubbing and stealthing to avoid people that are actually geared since they do more than PWNZ the NuubZors
---
They look too skinny to be a warrior 😼
---
You mean Gnomedragon.
---
Did you really just said that Will of the forsaken is meh in pvp? o_0
---
No use. You are a retailer who doesn’t have enjoyed leveling in vanilla yet. So you will in Classic. I won’t enjoy leveling slow reading all the quest for the 100 times. I will enjoy rush and gank.
---
You’re complaining about people ganking low levels on a PvP server. It’s not against the rules and I’m sure as hell gonna fight every single alliance I see.  If you don’t like it, go roll a PVE server or go play BFA
---
Aww, i wish they would have added housing to the original game. I remember them talking about it for a long time.
---
You mean the alliance noobs I wanted to pvp against whilst levelling? 😭
---
No. The early epic mounts without armor are bind on use.
---
&gt; Yeah no guild had naxx on farm. It was the absolute guild breaker. 
---
Guilds absolutely had Naxx on farm, what are you talking about?
---
Orgrimmar comfy and trolls cool 👹
---
Troll priest pve.  Love healing and having a utility toolkit.  Played undead priest in retail wotlk through to present and I always hated seeing my shoes, so troll it is.  I wanted to pvp,  but friends wanna do pve and realistically I doubt I'll have the time nor patience for pvp.
---
Most of ppl Wants fair stv pvp with people same level fighting while questing. I want unfair pvp. One shooting retailers without they even see what happens.. again and again..
---
Undead Rogue on a PvP server because I'm an edgy and sadistic 30-year-old man-child.
---
It can be if we are one the same realm. I’ll let you some if I’m sleeping or raiding.
---
Well... if dying is the objective, thats one less thing to worry about. :)
---
All dropped mounts are BoP IIRC.
---
Got charged DKP for "loot counciled"? What? Also loot council is for optimal distribution for progression guilds. It's not for fair distribution. And yeah it requires the guys running it to know pretty much everything about the game, how else are you gonna know what's optimal?
---
It’s one thing to stroll through a zone dismounting to kill every poor bastard you happen upon and even another to camp a low level zone for an hour or so every once in awhile but to make it a full time job is a bit sad
---
I don't think it would be a long beta if it is public. If blizzard can keep their blinders on for Authenticity and just fix what needs to work then it will be a good beta.
---
It's already been said Classic would release "Summer 2019", so depending on when 8.2 is expected, it could be.
---
Um? 😶
---
Hunter as the least played class? Is this a joke?
---
Least popular in raid slots relative to the total hunter population maybe, but there are tons of hunters both on pservers and in polls.
---
Especially DM, the quest line requires so much running around, its hardly worth it. For more quest oriented ppl, the blue item from the q is nice.
---
Will i get enough cloth to level up both first aid and tailoring?
---
That’s why the community should then rally together and have a massive PvP war to stop them. That’s how people get shit done in vanilla.  I’ve lead tonnes of raids on private servers when alliance guilds were greifing STV and camping everyone. We managed to completely clear them for a bit so all the low levels could get their quests handed in.  I actually lead the charge and it was glorious.  I held nothing against the alliance for doing what they did
---
Zeplin from thunderbluff to orgrimmar then zeplin from orgrimmar to undercity
---
You'll just have to run. Grab the FPs at Camp Mojache (if its in from the start), Ratchet, Crossroads and then go into Org to get then FP there before going out again to grab the Zeppelin.
---
There really is no easy way.
---
Yea dude, the amount of "celebrity" worship in the streaming/YouTube community is fucking weird. 
---
I guess alot of it comes to down lonely people feeling like they're a part of something and being accepted by community.... Kinda like a cult, yea your right about the cult thing lol.
---
I messed around on a private server yesterday. Made a human warrior and there were three other people farming wolves and vermin.  I am terrified for launch day.
---
I did...
---
this. I hope we will see addons really fast into the beta so I can set up everything before classic starts
---
Considering how garrisons ended up, I'm more than glad no form of this ever made it into Vanilla.
---
Hah! look at this peasant with only over 2k hours
---
15 bucks today is different from 15 bucks back in the day
---
I am pretty sure that he means for warriors. Which is kinda correct since they can already break fear with Berserker Rage.
---
However, I do not feel like it is such a big deal. You will be staring at your character for many hours to come. Rather enjoy it and learn to play with your limitations.
---
I played a alliance warlock and won verus most undead warlocks in 1v1s and I do not think that racials are that important in most situations if you play well.
---
Probably not but unless he starts his own guild then this is the closest. Plus other people reading this thread thinking "I like the idea but not the extremes you're taking it to" might prefer the Kor Kron Vanguard.
---
This is correct. I’m having an argument in another thread about how it’s greifing and bannable to kill members of the opposite faction over and over
---
They look great with some big axe and helmet, plus they're unusual in the Horde. WotF and Cannibalism are great assets for a warrior.
---
another thing I never understood about this scene is.. WHY THE FUCK DOES THE MAGE USE FIREBALLS...
---
That's the disappointing part. It worked for the most past (a dead, irrelevant world didn't become any "deader or irrelevanter", after all), but the sheer fact this solution was both needed and did its job is... sad. 
---
Retail is an amalgamation of seemingly good but damaging decisions piled on over the years, which needs even more messing up just to keep the whole house of cards upwards as expansions keep getting churned.
---
You dont WANT that, but its going to happen for sure. You have a token bought with real money that can be used for classic game time, the tokens WILL be sold for in game gold. If not by blizzard, then by 3rd party.
---
And tbh, people buying gold was SO vanilla like. We hosted gold selling MC runs and when T2 druid pants were sold for 2000g, do you really think the guy buying them was grinding that gold himself ?
---
TOPPEST OF KEKS TO YOU SIR
---
Lich king has a better dental plan.
---
Thats not classic, thats any MMORPG lol
---
The argument that you pay for 2 games is kinda weird. I have absolutely zero interest in BFA and this is also why I think I would've preferred a separate launcher for Classic, but hey, cant have everything.
---
Haha, this reminds me of flying behind someone when I was a kid, this memory has always stuck with me.
---
Me: Nice ass.
---
Her: thanks ;)
---
Me: I wasn’t talking about you.
---
Her: ???
---
Her: LOL
---

---
I'm guessing that they will either release in tandem or classic will come out first with 8.2 soon after. Activision obviously is sweating with BFA's state right now, but being able to include the people only playing classic in the sub numbers will look good.
---
Who down voted this? Anyways, HAPPY CAKE DAY!!
---
Ye, man, they are totally, definitely not in the bottom of the [polls](https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/).
---
Dude,  cannibalise is the ultimate insult post fight.  Plus it is a great quick heal between bandages.
---
Yes WoW no longer supports 32bit.
---
Jeesus this was annoying. When he goes from desolace to feralas, he DISAPPEARS on the phase change line for quite a while and you can miss him completely.
---
Funny thing. Since i played Warcraft 3 beforehand i decided to roll Horde, because i wanted to be the good guy :D.
---
not viable because all the xp will be shared with 4 others. There is a boosting method for some dungeons like Gnomeregan but i only want to go in Dungeons with a lot of quests are a item that will be bis for 10+ levels (or even bis till raid)
---
Orc Hunter, PvP server. I always pick PvP servers because I consider that the only valid way to play the game, world PvP being an important part of the game.
---
my guess is they invite all classic demo players because i still have the classic client installed
---
Aye, but if folk dont like it they can hearth and go else where to level. Thats the joy of classic wow, I felt you were never forced to stay in one place. 
---
when I stopped raiding and playing on my mains when Cat was released, i'd use my heirlooms and enchants to level a char to 13 and then play in WSG so I could either 1 shot folk with my hunter, or be unkillable as a pally, and with sprint/speed pots on a rogue, could run the flag back so quickly. 
---
It was totally unfair and over powered, but was great fun :D
---
Kinda sad you think like that
---
classic doesn't do patches, it does 1.12 with very specific exceptions that are explicitly mentioned
---
they said it will only be temporary to cope with server load at the start
---
yup, I cannot wait! I loved the level grind. You could go fast or slow, it was all down to the player. I used to burn through my rested XP on mobs, farming humanoids for Cash/cloth drops, then get back to questing or instancing. Questing was easier as you could just log out at the area Inn you were at and start again when you had time. 
---
I dont plan to raid, so getting a gaming laptop.....so I can even sit in work and max out my fishing / cooking while I'm supposed to be working :D
---
Trust me sir, you dont know what you're wishing for with the numbers to come with classic
---
&gt; like 5 seconds aft
---
I regret it until this day!
---
Shiiit, that lvl 19 twink server was the absolute best! I remember doing a couple of 10 man raids on SFK some BiS twink items. I would NOT mind if such servers were reintroduced :)
---
Its probably not really viable as you will need to get to the instance. Lower level instances tend to have LFG in the area the instance is in, so you cant be instantly ported to the start of the instance. This makes leveling via dungeons tougher.  You'd lose so much time standing around looking for a group.
---
There aint no TB Zepp in vanilla! Gotta run through the barrens like the peasant cow he'll be!
---
Well, let's say it's two weeks until we have a Beta out there. And then four weeks of testing. And lastly two weeks before release. That's about mid June 🙏
---
Can I play with you?
---
On one character...
---
This. I've played 1-60 so many times that I'm not worried about spoiling anything. I'd love to help out by looking for bugs and helping to make Classic as good as it deserves to be. That and maybe test macros, scripts and addons. We'll see!
---
I guess guilds differ based on comp because it went rogues, mages, locks, warriors in order of DMG in my KT farming guild. I suppose fury warriors with TF would do better but my guild didn't have any.
---
The most effective way to level is to do each dungeon once with all quests. Past that you're wasting time because not only would grinding mobs be more efficient, but you're also devaluing the experience you get from quests due to you leveling up. Green quests award much less exp than yellow/orange. There is no benefit at all to dungeon mob grinding in terms of leveling fast.
---
I have a question, is 1.13 the version they're going with  now or is that an internal beta thing?
---
It's beyond inefficient, it's crazy. It would take *so* much longer than normal leveling it's not even worth considering.
---
Of course. Why would you need to have BFA installed to play a different game?
---
Like 10-15 minutes per ghoul. It was *mostly* for the challenge, but they could drop some very nice gear.
---
Wotf also breaks seduction from warlock pet, wich saves you from a nasty soul fire, its not that bad. You can also get feared in battle stance.
---
Changing your mind would mean that I was somehow invested in really getting you to play the game. What I know about you so far is that you're too cheap to pay 15 bucks a month for arguably the best edition of an MMO ever made.
---
I'll be glad to see you go.
---
Doubt it lol
---
I'm frothing uncontrollably at the mouth rn
---
THANK THE GOD FOR ION AND HIS TITS
---
you can cancel ice block and i think you still have aggro ;)
---
I agree that it shouldn't be open at first at least. Maybe have a few open beta weekends to stress test though. However, I do think there should be a large amount of testers though. The wider you can cast your net, the better the chances of finding the important game breaking bugs.
---
Usually beta characters are deleted so release has a fresh start
---
Can't help but say it, if you want to PvP and the class you want to play can be an orc than you want to be an orc.
---
Who you calling average?!!
---
=O  
---
You play WoW at work?
---
If they did do this, I dont think they would boost. They would want people to go to as many places as possible to test as many quests, mobs, and dungeons as possible. If they did boosts, most people would just pvp or dungeon instead of exploring/ questing.
---
Lol this guy doesn't understand beta testing. BETA MALE!

Hunters Feign Death MC 2006 colorized
---
Yes bois, test the beta for us. Do it good
---
It's because Blizzget has the branches hardcoded. You need to add classic_wow_beta and fix up another small thing about the cdns in order to get it to work
---
I didn't even bought bfa
---
I feel tha same way, cuh. I dont wanna ruin it, neye mean?
---
Still, your death will soon follow.  
---
Only those who can feign their death or can vanish in thin air shall live.
---
Do you by any chance still have the command list for doing these things?  I run a private server and it's known that not all GM commands are known - such as clipping through walls.
---
Happy Birthday! :)
---
Yup, no problem at all. Classic is open to anyone with an active subscription.
---
to play hunter at the highest level its pretty insane, pet micromanagement, autoshot&gt;multishot&gt;autoshot&gt;raptorstrike, constantly living on the line of melee and ranged to get the most dps.
---
I had not even played the game for almost a year when I got BFA beta access so no it would be very strange if classic beta had a cost tied to it.
---
i actually hope the client is not too massive i dont want any of retail wow taking up my valuable disk bits
---
Thanks, pal!
---
It makes some sense if Acti Blizz decides to force you to download Classic and retail. Gives you one more reason to try out one or the other with a shared subscription.
---
Oh whoops my bad, that wasn’t introduced till wotlk right? Poor boy
---
Could probably download it through the terminal.
---
Please stop it. These treats are made daily.. several times...
---
First classic, the rest comes when its time.
---
Hopefully they do a test for launch, with everyone at Level 1. After that then insta 60s sure.
---
Ah ok i see what you mean
---
Ah darn I see thats too bad for hybrid classes, they will remain useless then
---
I makes sense ! But I actually think it's the exact opposite. It's not an Human going to Tirisfal, but an Undead going to Elwynn. Just look at the very green trees around, and at the rather clear sky. It's also the warlock who's attacking while the mage is standing his ground on the top of the tower.
---
Whoever gets a beta key please make videos/ streams ( if it is legally allowed)
---
If someone has trouble finding, just head to games tab and from there you scroll down and find beta settings
---
I was able to do that in vanilla back when i was 11 yeas old...
---
&gt; That and, there would just be endless bitching about it on the forums.
---
Just like in retail vanilla!
---
Bad logic.
---
Hmmm darn I see what you mean, that doesn't sound to good, almost a waste of time to pick it
---
I don’t think they will release the expansion, I think classic will stay at level 60! Only releasing of new content will be lvl 60 releases like ZG, AQ40, Naxx etc.
---
Anyone wanting the rest can roll on normal game servers.
---
What “might” happen is they open TBC classic servers but for those wanting to stay 60, I can’t see them going to all this trouble, listening to what folk want, then just increasing the level cap all over again in a couple years time. (Just my opinion) 😁👍
---
You can see most of it on flight paths, can't you? Or maybe I misremember
---
Have you followed activation in the news ? Being greedy assholes is their operating motto.
---

---
It could eventually be the ruins of Durnhold keep in Hillsbrad, as the zone is also very green, has a ruined castle, and has a lot of Human/Undead fighting in it :)
---
SPirit wolves I think are in lich kind expac, maybe burning crusade but definitely not classic :(
---
I suddenly remember doing Mara ages ago and having to stop in TB to catch a connecting flight to Shadowprey Village. Hated it. Good times.
---
According to the AMA yesterday it wasnt greifing in vanilla
---
You should binge now so you can join in with the masses in celebrating the last few episodes.

I fear you are right, evrything need to be monetize,

If there is one game I would absolutely not mind spending money on for beta access, it's defo WoW Classic.
---
Elemental was awesome in WotLK for sure, maybe even in TBC they were good, but in classic I think they would just be very quite bad.
---
Use search bar.
---
I hope they prioritize people who played during vanilla for some of their invites.
---
Ah shoot I see what you mean, if its one of the worst I wont waste too much time on it then
---
Limited vendor recipes, as well as enough gold to buy them.
---
“Outplayed” well yeah..he potted
---
But with no lava burst and stuff ele seems really gimped in classic :(
---
They were all present during Vanilla nothing strange here
---
Getting to STV before it's full of level?? players is all I'm aiming for.
---
Up to BWL there are 2-4 spots for hunters but at the end at naxx the spots slim down to 1-2. It’s a harsh truth. That being said, most people don’t play up to that point.
---
if you canceled bloodrage and instantly charged you could charge in combat.

I am wet with frames per second

knowing blizzard you will arbitrarily have to grind bfa reputations for two months before they allow you to play classic

There was a detailed comment on UD vs Troll PvP shadow priests made by a SPriest video maker from RetroWoW, Fleyz. I think he broke it down very well, so I'll just copy paste it here :
---
Quote :" ***I originally created the UD after I had finished everything on that, I decided to make a troll purely to mix it up. I now almost entirely play the troll and the UD is left offline.***
---
**Reasons:**
---
**1) WOTF vs Berserking** \- WOTF is only useful vs A) Classes which fear (Priests / Warriors / Warlocks) B) Those classes need to land a fear - I play an extremely cowardly play-style, very rarely getting feared. C) You can use Berserking vs EVERY CLASS. D) Berserking Mind blast is one of the hardest spells in the game to interrupt E) Berserking Mana Burn is the fastest stationary mana drain in vanilla F) Berserking Mind control is Savage.
---
**2) Hex of Weakness** is a 30 yd range curse which reduces healing by 20% for 2 mins. It also reduces the physical damage done by the target by a minor amount. My tactic with Hex is that I'm purely using it for the healing de-buff. Which means I can use Rank 1 Hex. Rank 1 Hex costs 35 mana and has NO COOL DOWN. It can only be dispelled by Mages and Druids. I've racked up some serious playtime with my priest and I can count on one hand the amount of time my curse has been dispelled. I use max rank Hex on melee who are training myself or someone on my team who is decent (for a bit more mitigation) Hex also affects POTS, Healthstones, Death coils and Whipper Root Tubers. On Retro-wow the food which everyone uses form the vendor restores 5% of you HP every second. This food counts as a "heal" so the Hex can further slow their regeneration.
---
**3) Shadowguard vs Touch of Weakness** \- Shadowguard is similar to touch of weakness except, it doesn't apply a curse debuff to the attacker reducing their melee damage (BAD) and cannot crit (Which isn't always bad as it will not proc enrage on warriors training you). However Shadowguard hurts melee and ranged attacks and can proc blackout and shadow weaving, has a low mana cost and gets an absurd % of spell damage and has a stack of 3. Meaning you need to re-apply it less (Touch of Weakness has 1 charge).
---
**4) Undead is still strong**, don't get me wrong. Undead can even be stronger than Troll in certain situations. You can't use Devouring plague in 100% of fights though and one simple cleanse from a paladin really does hard counter DP. Also Dwarves who have any idea know they can stoneform out of it.
---
So a combination of the three then. I guess there exists people of all intelligence levels across the world, should have come as no surprise I suppose.
---
I apologize.
---
Although that would be great for combating exploits, don't you imagine it could cause issues in the future? Such as breaking something due to a change in the engine
---
Disagree with your points re: combat. Vanilla pvp is fantastic and it’s only as slow as you make it. If you are thinking the game well and using the full toolkit of abilities, trinkets, strategies, etc available for you it requires a lot of skill. Watch good vanilla pvpers and they’ll be doing and thinking about so many things at once that you would have to slow the game down by 10x just to analyze everything. 
---
Combat in retail on the other hand is oversimplified. Some of the abilities feel smoother running on a modern engine but it’s definitely not much better as you say. It still have things that complicate it and it is more balanced between all classes and specs for sure though.
---
they dig their own grave for retail i they release classic at the same time as 8.2
---
no
---
That isn't at all what is going on here.
---
There is no zepp from TB to Org?
---
Which I think is a good thing.
---
If retail ends up being more old school, there will be less justification against those lobbying for quality of life changes in classic.
---
The group who crave QoL and fast epics need retail to get their fix, and we want to keep them away from classic.
---
I'm calling exalted in the Timewalkers event thing.
---
UD warrior is completely fine for pvp, their racials are fine.
---
You don't? Scrub.
---
Hunter population is way too big for two measly slots per raid.

---
We need people out in the world and cities, not hidden away in a housing instance, that lesson was learned from garrisons.
---
Since every other scene takes place in the world that feels unlikley.
---
The cool thing about going horde is how balanced all races are. Every race/class combo has something going for them.  I am dead set on playing alliance, but thats something I definitely feel sad about.
---
I hope they prioritize proven bug hunters rather than streamers or people that just want to play the game.  
---
Go play private servers if you want to get your fix, play the beta if you're serious about finding and fixing bugs.
---
How will you differentiate between retail players and those who have waited for Classic for years upon years but dont have the time anymore to no life the game like you? 
---
More importantly, with the right-click reporting function, you'll undoubtedly find yourself getting suspended for griefing. This idea is interesting, but not at all worth it imo.
---
Other people provided you the answer, but I just wanna point out the excitement I have is the fact that the terrain improvements in legion were INSANE. They optimized the socks off of terrain, so add that to 2006 view distance and boom, more performance than you can handle
---
No... I scrub =(
---
Yeah, as I said in the other reply, I meant ghost wolves. It's been over ten years since I've played, so all of the names of the abilities are not crisp in my mind.
---
You know there are private servers out there, right?
---
Meet me on the EU server and prepare to get rekted kid
---
Fingers crossed. 🤞
---
lol yes, I am the same. 
---
I know I'll have fun with most classes I'd pick but having this doubt in my head that maaaaybe another one is "better" messes with me.
---
Not anywhere near the same thing. Not anywhere near the same kind of communities we had back then. Go back to your private server and their elitist kids
---
Can’t tell if trolling or not
---
Whoops I meant [multi-thread optimizations](https://www.wowhead.com/news=287727/new-multithread-optimizations-coming-in-patch-8-1-tides-of-vengeance). I got a bit too excited
---
i hate the term "meme specs" ...
---
can u pls use some language that was around in vanilla?
---
Thunderbluff zeppelin was patch 3.2, only option is to run in classic.
---
Yes, after naxx.
---
Yes, it'll be a separate client. No point having to install 7 expansions you'll never use.
---
I played vanilla starting in the open beta...
---
I had a moment similar to yours.But I stepped from Tirisfal Glades to Plaguelands and got my ass handed to me by a ?? level rotten bear.
---
Best.Feeling.Ever.
---
I also learner why not to open Blood of Heroes or whatever these small rock wells filled with blood were called.
---
If they don't boost they will not get the content tested. There are very few (vocal) no lifers that would play enough to cap out those level caps in a week. I would imagine Blizzard would want all sorts of content types tested. Also dungeoning for gear on a character that is going to be lost? People would do all sorts and that would be good.
---
This beta is to stress test more than anything, the more people the better.
---
[Tri-spec priest](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrs0bZbAzzZVMgzcu). You're hard work to kill and really good support for your two friends. They'll be able to kill stuff as well as look after you while you keep them alive.
---
that is a terrible argument total hours are relevant, the entire point is that it is impossible to get HWL stuff playing regularly, so most peoples options for PVP gear was the blue pvp gear which is severely outclassed by AQ/Naxx gear. So if you were a primarily PVP player even though you might severely outskill someone it didn't matter because they did twice your damage.
---
I think a better solution would have been to first of all make it where it was reasonable to get HWL gear without quitting your job second would be to implement a stat cap on BG's where naxx gear would be on par with HWL gear, any serious PVPer will tell you that the game balance completely falls apart by the end of AQ start of Naxx, stamina doesn't keep pace with damage and it turns into a who can global the other first kind of game.
---
Their solution to that was resilience and for better or worse it solved the problem you put forth about pvp gear being better than pve gear for pve and made it where pvp wasn't people oneshotting each other.
---
"Roll with me, I'm on Keith EU"

Is there a bot somewhere starting these threads within a certain interval? It's really ***smart***.
---
But no, really, stop. It's ridiculous; you're ridiculous. We haven't even gotten a ***release date*** for Classic, and already people are talking about adding new content (????) What? Huh? My god, people are so incredibly ***s m a r t***.
---
It's not "exactly" what's going on. But I think his statement is closer to my perception of the truth than your statement :)
---
Actually, blizz has already mentioned that quality of testers is really important.   
---
  In one ptr (think it was mop or something like it?) they made it accessible to everyone that purchased a combo and resulted in so many reports that didn't really helped or said much that they couldn't find the quality, good reports they needed.
---
Yes, that would be fine. Still, my money is on the beta being pretty short. 2 months max.
---
Going from durotar to orgrimmar like wtf this city is amazing. 
---
Oh 2005.
---
Common.
---
I’m a bit of an audiophile, so if what you say is true, I sincerely hope they are looking at sorting it out.
---
Thanks! Settings just got updated.
---
you can buy game time with when classic launches, buy games or whatever else you can with Blizzard Balance
---
Got to stay true to your class.  
---
Excellent
---
anyone with an account can play in the beta?
---
What were  you doing that landed you there?
---
So true, like im sure i enjoy this and that, but whats the "best" for me.
---
I wonder how to get rid of that mindset
---
That's the main reason I play horde actually. I really like dwarves and humans and female nelfs, but gnomes (specially male) and the monkey armed nelf males disgust me so much that I must have the option to kill them
---
XP wasn't split 5 ways if that's what you're suggesting.
---
What was that?
---
What is the CDN?
---
But will we be able to rearrange characters on the select screen? That's one change I wouldn't mind to help out my OCD
---
As a former Paladin  in vanilla, I've been considering going Shaman lately. I really like the class flavor. What made you decide on it?
---
I have up and started pserver in Jan cos classic wow turned my head so much.
---
Can we get an F for march
---
Like, expect a game based on the fact that you have infinite amount of time to pour into it.
---
Even the most basic thing will take an anachronistic amount of time.
---
Between 1 and 150 days
---
Like... you know people have bills to pay right? Getting fired for most people is not an option. You don't take chances with stuff like this.
---
I immediately kick those people due to their dangerously low iq.
---
rrright
---
Dude, there's no hacking at all going on. This is all publically available.
---
No personal loot, it's the old system.
---
I love pulling on mage. Just use one wants hit and it's all fine.
---
Nice
---
#nO cHaNgEs
---
sounds really stressful, 2 Major Releases at the same time...       
---
more likely with 1 or 2 weeks diff.
---
Oh, I doubt it. Itd take away from the retail game's new content which I doubt they'd want to do.
---
But if they are up for that, then RELEASE THE GAME. LET ME INNNNNNNNNN.
---
Scholomance= School of necromancy. 
---
mind= blown
---
Now listen here you little...
---
Warlock less common than mages and you want both casters in raids. Resto druid pry least played class but also dont need many in the raid. Hunter pry most played class but 99% of them are clueless noobs so I'd say semi decent hunters are the rarest raiders. If we are including meme specs then I'll say boomkin dru is the real unicorn of vanilla.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
I've never actually played wow, so I'm excited. Weird, considering I was 13 when the game came out and 90% of my friends were obsessed. I just couldnt get in to grinders back in the day.
---
right click it off
---
No there are tests about this. They profit more from GoA.
---
Grats on 100 man, another great show as per
---
Yes, they do. The fact that Blizzard has the answer to all accuracy questions does not mean that all of them actually accurate in Classic. I can guarantee you that there will be areas that they overlooked simply because no developer thought to look into the area in the first place.
---
This was during Cata though, so it might be different from your time, but I had a weird bug that made me instantly disconnect whenever I entered the Ghostlands (Quite problematic since the ZG instance was located there, I had to be summoned inside). I also instantly DCed in Firelands.
---
Everytime this happened I needed a GM to teleport me out of the place, since the game would just instantly crash if I tried to log on, meaning that my character was just endlessly stuck. Whenever I wrote a ticket about this, it was generally fixed in less than 30 minutes (Often instantly!) while my good old game-play issue tickets took just as long as normal.
---
So they have some kind of priority system that seems to work wonders.
---
It could help with keeping the population down a bit in the beginning. Those that just want to check out Classic but are firm lovers of BfA will probably prioritize BfA.
---
8.2 Sounds like a content patch and not a second Release. Is is not?
---
But you need more mobs. Its a null sum game.
---
CDN is short for content delivery network.
---
It’s a manner of releasing and delivering digital content to people. Think of it like a technical platform blizzard use to get releases to us!
---
Stopped watching his videos because of this. Also he has bad info in some (he said troll hunters only need6% hit in endgame because of their bow racial, lawl)
---
do you think we will need to sub to both classic and bfa or will it be a single sub for both?
---
60s in the beta? What's the point?
---
Well, guessing the part of housing im mostly interested could just be added (like it was)... guild banks.
---
You’re in the vast majority with this opinion by the way.  And it’s going to be players rolling on the single piece of loot (no personal loot).
---
Of course it could happen, but the pros outweigh the cons a lot.
---
How? They are two different games, with a different DEV team. How and what gets taken away from Retail?
---
Now all that is needed is for thotbot (sp?) to roll back to 2005-2007 for a complete genuine experience :-)
---
I dunno - maybe I’ll go read one of the 100 threads a day posted here on this topic.
---
Blizzard can get data from those who simply play the game in beta testing, though. As long as they actually play, that is.
---
Not true green quest give the same xp
---
Why so salty?
---
where did i mention classic patches, i mentioned VANILLA patch and classic stages. Majordomo loot tables wasnt in launch, it was closer to DM than anything, so by that logic it should be added in stage II.
---
Agreed
---
but it could also destroy BfA completely.. The reactions to the new stuff that 8.2 brings were meh.  
---
Blizzard has to fight for every sub now. They are heading towards a dangerous path if they really think this would be a good idea.
---
Lol no
---
the shaman ... but i am really not sure for classic ....
---
Did they remove the textures entirely from the game files or did they remove them from what we as players can see when we're in the game? Those are two very different things.
---
More people can tag mobs = more amount of mobs tagged as you got less competiton.
---
The two games share a subscription though, from an investor standpoint it doesn't really matter what you're doing with your 15 dollars.
---
Mostly the pathing and timing, depending on how the pathing decides for you to move, you can literally still be “charging” after he stun has worn off and the guy has long fled
---
When you have chosen let me know, I'll reply that it was the best choice and you can enjoy WoW to its fullest.   :&gt;
---
"use hand of edward the odd" - so just farm for like 6 months to buy that and then farm some more? lol
---
Yeah just saying how it's going to be not how it should be...
---
only blizzard beta I got invited to was HotS and the very end of Legion beta (or the xpac before that - dont remember) so fingers crossed
---
nope but you got less the more were in your grp
---
B-b-b-but can't we just give paladins taunt?
---
its already confirmed,... it's gonna be a shared sub
---
This happens on pservers too, plus it has other problems
---
Elite mobs give bonus XP and groups get a bonus XP on top of that. Also a group of players is *more* than the sum of its parts because of buffs, cc, healing, rage, etc.
---
A good, well played group can efficiently grind dungeons for XP. But the issue is that you actually need a good, well played group, which is hard to come by while leveling.
---
I personally did this on one of my toons for a while. You do each dungeon about 3-4 times before moving to the next. It is efficient as long as you make good use of your waiting times while forming the group and as long as your group is experienced. But it is *very* inefficient for those runs where your group isn't quick. It is like night and day.
---
I won't rush again as i did many times before. I will do all quests and stalk all places.on a map, level a professions and than switch a zone. Thats what i want from classic. I wont lose anything by doing 60 in 4 monyhs instead of 2. I desire fun, guild, group raiding, trading.
---
8.2 is a Major event in the Blizzard WoW HQ. is the same as Classic
---
What's funny is the amount of people calling you a moron for thinking it would be anything other than 7.3.5 when it was obvious that 7.3.5 was the current patch at the time they started working on Classic and that it would be brought up to speed with retail at some point :)
---
But it wouldn't take away from retail. A WoW sub is a WoW sub, no matter if you play Classic or BfA.
---
Copyright 2004-2018. No copyright in 2019 PogChamp
---
There will be players that will want to play both or would have to pick one over another. Same day launch is not a good idea. Likely Classic will be just after initial 8.2 rush settles down.
---
Im gonna play balance druid
---
managing a pet well is a good distinction between a good class player and a bad one, but you are misunderstanding the significance of Literally not being able to use all of your skills at any given time.
---
Also pet management for hunters is way more important then lock, and sick warlocks can hit 4K shadowbolt a this was a bad example that you used.
---
Undead mage, PvP.... I also won’t have much time to play but damnit I can’t imagine this world without the constant fear of ganking
---
ooh i forgot about ww axe. excellent point
---
&gt;Entertainment media
---
ok, if Tips is an *entertainer* (which is fine), why should I listen to what he has to say when it comes to factual announcements or guides? is this a video that strikes you more as aiming for *entertainment value*, or for *news update*? i think the answer is obvious.
---
not sure what you're defending here. if you think every blue post warrants 14 minute video analysis, we just aren't going to agree.
---
Bad for the players, for sure, never said otherwise. 
---
However it's much more about server stability in the long run. Because how can they have stable servers, if EVERYONE is rushing in.
---
Shamans are by far the most desirable class to pop ratio.  You will want 6-8 on horde for a 40 man
---
Huh? You can enjoy the game without being a meta slave.
---
A green quest gives the same xp as it would if it was completed whilst yellow, orange or red.
---
My guess is that beta will likely take place on Blizzard's usual, boring old WoW beta realms. Sorry.  :(
---
I'm pretty sure you dreamt this.
---
As it is written in Kaplanicus chapter 18 verse 2
---
i know its not MC but in AQ 40 the hunters would run out of C'thuns room and FD but if you stood in the doorway you could chain his eye beam to them and kill them. also during priest call on Nef they would kill the hunters,  nobody likes hunters.  
---
for those that dont know Cthun has a eye beam that chains to targets within like 8 yards and does increased (i think 2x) damage each chain.  nef call for priests make their heals do damage instead of heals.
---
Okay, I have honestly no clue, how much work a content patch and a Release is.
---
1 Week would still have the same positive effect for the server stability.
---
yeah its derpy.  palas scale mostly off dmg+healing for goodness sake!
---
Fishing derby shouldn't be out until ZG patch if they are indeed following a Vanilla content release.
---
Why would I change your mind lmao. If it's not worth $15 per month, then stay away.
---
I had a rough night, went through about eight boxes of tissue paper, but I think I’ll be good now.  /s in case it’s needed.  ;)
---
The way I see it, Tanks are the hardest raid role as they have to know the boss mechanics inside out. Next its healers, as they need to know their spells and rotations / cooldowns to best preserve mana and also keep everyone up, especially in long fights. These two roles are the hardest as less folk play these roles. 
---
DPS are the most heavily played class as they have so many different classes to pick/choose. All bring something to the raid. But its tougher to find a raid guild as DPS (than say if you're a healer or tank).
---
Thanks man, great reminder!
---
I would argue enhance is probably worse than either ret or boomkin.  Everything it does an improved totem spec resto will just be more useful.  Enhance is also the worst nightfall swinger
---
thank you ;D
---
And 99% of people on the internet pull random numbers out of their ass.
---
what iggy said is right. Make sure you are on time, ready to raid. Have the max spells, have the BiS or as close to it as you can. know your class / role well and have all the right consumables ready to raid, and you'll be fine.
---
For me the problem is i never played vanilla, i only joined in late TBC. And i feel like i missed out a big time, so i am very happy they are bringing it back.
---
i'm doing something similar though i intend to be maybe 25/26/0 so i can heal raids, sort-of aoe farm and then have reckoning stacking up in pvp.  heal for a while -&gt; do a quick reck bomb -&gt; go back to healing :3
---
hey man sorry only check in here sometimes :D
---
It won't be that big based on what size it used to be in Vanilla, and you won't have to install retail either. You can play without even having BFA (or any of the other expansions afaik - not sure if they're all compendium'd now) as long as your account has an active subscription.
---
Even on horde Warlock is usually close to second last with priests.  Druids obviously the outlier usually between 5-8%
---
The place the Battlenet Client downloads from.
---
Hands down unarguable hunter is the best all around pvp class in vanilla. 2nd best is a distant 2nd. They are ranged... they burst as hard as anyone... they have cc almost as good as mage... they are tanky and have a pet. With equal gear hunter can just melee a war down ez.
---
...yes, I get that. You still wont be faster as you need twice the amount of mobs.
---
Sharding, multiple small realms... if they can't do launch then they won't be able to do like Silithus events on anything but small populations.
---
Well done.
---
One thing you have to know about hunters in vanilla WoW. Every gear is hunter gear.
---
Players. Most people won't play both MMOs simultaneously. Besides, might as well wait for the inevitable mid release subscription drops to introduce Classic and get another boost in the number of subs.
---
They need at least a week or two apart, if only just to make launch of both easier, as yes it's seperare teams, mostly, but if issues at launch of classic or 8.2 it nice to be able to call apon both teams if needed instead of.... Sorry can't help we have launch issue too.
---
Never said they can't do a launch. This is not what I'm talking about at all.
---
I think they will release 8.2 with a buy a year sub, get a classic beta invite combo. Maybe even throw in a low-res mount for your BFA account. Good way for them to cash in on the hype.
---
dont worry, only streamers who doesnt care about classic will get classic beta anyway :)
---
There’s no issue with rolling on gear that isn’t your highest tier armor type. You should take a look at the dps Warriors BIS list and see how much leather they use.
---
No! I have vacation in the middle of nowhere mid June!
---
Not at all. 
---
You've even got warriors running around in full leather and what not because some of it is Pre Raid Bis. Truestrike and Devil Saur for example, are leather and pre Bis for Warrior DPS
---
That is the point. You need to read.
---
Not at all. The polite thing to do is let people know you're going to roll on something but most people will expect players to roll on lower tier items.
---
I think this forcing nostalgia bit is going to backfire on all of you. The best reason to play classic is because mechanically it is a superior game.
---
It isn't everyone who has played understands that blizzard had no idea how to balance stats back then. All physical dps will be taking bis leather items including warriors. All casters and healers will roll on cloth. Just the way of vanilla. If people get upset it's because they are bad
---
Idk why someone downvoted you. You have different goals you wanna achieve in classic than other people - that's awesome. Don't let others bring you down, you do what you enjoy the most in Classic!
---
Can't speak for pservers as I never played them but rolling for leather agi gear was never heavily frowned upon in vanilla.
---
What *was* generally frowned upon was Hunters needing melee weapons (even if it was an agi weapon) if there were Rogues that needed it. Same in reverse for ranged weapons: it was frowned upon for melee classes to need on it if a Hunter needed on it.
---
Most of the time it's easily resolved in advance by agreeing what you plan to roll need on before hitting the instance.
---
No, it's not. Putting "exactly" in quotation marks doesn't make the impact any different. There's no rbeach of security here at all.
---
1 Week is fine. Doesn't  refute anything I have written, concerning the tourist problem and server stability.
---
Remembering it’s a marathon and not a sprint. You don’t need to accumulate 500g week one.
---
Splitting the playerbase won't do anything as 8.2 has very little to draw people attention from Classic. And it would be really low effort - drop a retail patch so that Classic launch will have less players in theory.
---
Yeah enhance is also bad in PvE, I couldn't really rank it with the two others as I only played Alliance back then.. ^ ^ ^'
---
lol I actually did that back in the day, as a tauren hunter with 2x ''of the monkey'' swords. I even bought 'em off the AH. And yes, I was always out of ammo.
---
Gonna turn off my home WiFi and download it via mobile data to accurately get the patch day feel.
---
You do realize that if you’re going to play Classic you’ll need a subscription, making you a «retailer» as well? Technically everyone will be a «retailer» so specifying «Retailer’s blood» is a bit redundant:)
---
Really? No one interested who play Retail in 8.2? Is Retail so bad?
---
It's published on the CDN aka the place that battle.net pulls the files for games from. Anything that gets posted to the CDN is public and essentially intended for download by the general public.
---
StormwindPrison and EmeraldDream were in Vanilla as far as I can tell.
---
[Heres a render of StormwindPrison.wmo from the Nost forums](http://i.imgur.com/aabQR7E.jpg)
---
[Can't verify if this is the legit Emerald Dream map from Vanilla, as its on a private server from 2008, but the map ID is consistent, so I'll have faith.](https://youtu.be/R0MlBEmM-io)
---
1 week would be OK, but there will be tourists, nothing we can do about that. I reckon 50% of the people who never played vanilla or pservers will struggle after a month. But that is another story for another thread.
---
Least played/most needed? Moonkin. I've only ever  seen about 3, and they are desperately needed for the moral boost they bring.
---
If the 15$ means there won't be any p2w in-game store shenanigans, my character won't just randomly dissapear due to server shutdown and there are no scummy backroom dealings behind the scenes, I am more than happy to pay 15$ a month.
---
I cant agree more, i definitely overlooked the WC3 remaster, and yes there financials were pretty nice.
---
I think that would be the best idea, exactly because of the initial surge of players who'll flock to classic if they release during a lull in retail.
---
I might underestimate how much the people stopped caring about Retail, if they don't care about 8.2. compared to classic.
---
It was just a thought, how to get rid of a good chunk of tourists and not to avoid them at all costs.
---
I just didn't think Retail was so bad, that it doesn't have a draw in their own playerbase. That is quite shocking.
---
this is  so wrong... its not even funny
---
My guess is it won't be open beta. People get invited at random + content creators are given keys to share in order to increase hype.
---
Huh wow did not know that blizzard games do not work anymore with mac, i mean Blizz one of the only always on Mac makers.
---
It will be faster if you're able to tag more mobs that would otherwise be taken by somebody else
---
I guess you won't be playing Classic ever since no one is willing to convince you, which is honestly a relief because you're the level 23 guy who sits in Orgrimmar and begs for money from random players.
---
"Give me 5 gold plz"
---
"uh why?"
---
"becuz lol cmooooooon"
---
We prefer the term handicapable
---
I think they have to do this, as they need to test areas, questing, levels, dung, raids at all levels really,
---
Kiting for 10-15 minutes ! You're much more patient than I am ! :o
---
There actually was a 1.13 client for a foreign language specifically
---
Yes, of course.
---
Resto Shamans are always in constant demand, as well as priests.
---
The only thing that matters is rolling for the current spec items, or if a player need an item for their offspec, it's polite to tell it in advance to see if anyone has objections. I still remember a feral druid rolling on a leather skirt with +healing stat I needed as a shaman healer ("why are you whining, maybe I'm going to be a healer!"). I checked their armory for a month, and they always were feral. (yep, it was later than vanilla)
---
There should be no problem, armor type is not something that has prio in vanilla.   
---
But if you want to be polite, ask in chat, or just tell, that you will be rolling this item is good for you.
---
Worst case you could boot up Linux on your machine and run WoW through that with WINE.
---
There’s plenty of room between even good and excellent warriors.
---
That's a whole level of optimization that was pretty much inconceivable at the time.
---
I mean, I leveled as prot paladin with a 1h.
---
I’ll definitely play the beta if I can. I’m so restless and anxious about playing Classic.
---
Do your thing man. Im gonna play a weird enhance battle mage. This games old as fuck don't let anyone tell you how to play. Make your own guild that takes hybrid specs if you want. That's what I am gonna do.
---
"You wont clear AQ like that" is something I hear a lot, to which I say "Lick my grundle from anus to ballhair" 
---
even if its true BWL gear is great, and dungeons are still plenty fun.
---
How is hunter the easiest class to be decent with. Seems like one of the hardest imo
---
Dwarf Priest, PVP or RP PVP if possible.
---
I REALLY wanted the cloth robe they could drop ~~though I never got it~~.  
---
Being in highschool with nothing else to do didn't hurt.
---
It doesn't even make sense. When I saw people talking about meme specs I though t they were talking about like Undead sub rogues. Since, there's actually been memes about undead rogues for years.
---
Yeah, ya know, the school o’ mancy
---
ALPHA &gt; BETA
---
I was always playing the german version and I never really thought about it..
---
In german we call it "sholo" or "sholomanns"
---
You forgot /s! People will down vote you now!
---
How close was being a GM to this video? 
---
https://youtu.be/uMIJO76gisI
---
Wasn't the classic demo 2 versions behind what they had internally anyway?
---
Yeah yeah we all know everybody's the best of the best here.
---
Show the videos were **you** roll on non AFK hunters.
---
The only way I see is to use free action potions, that's going to get costly (in time or gold) very fast.
---
You mean it's a chance to roll druid?
---
Nope. Trolls generally don't fly into Stornwind. :)
---
Might be, but that doesn't mean that ZG will be the first raid someone encounters. Back in vanilla a lot less people were participating in raiding (40 mans at least), compared to private servers were a lot more people are raiding.
---
Would ‘majority of users’ have been a better term sir? I meant no offense I swear, seeing the hype for classic has given me hope again 🙌
---
Always lovely to see a live karma suicide. Personally I'd pay $50 a month for classic... Glad it's only 15 though ofc.
---
"Hunter weapon"
---
Wat zijn de
---
&gt; but it could also destroy BfA completely
---
Could? You speak as if it's not dead now.
---
Same, those cliffs yell Azshara to me
---
as someone who never played a secound of wow this is going to be glorious
---
I never realized it either, I was just messing around!
---
Optimizing dps output as a hunter is not as easy as you make it out to be...
---
No, you are not tough enough to be worthy, you warrior pretending dress lover.
---
Nothing wrong with this idea if it’s what you want to do.  BfA is a completely different game than Classic, so there will be very little overlap.  Server doesn’t really matter as the concept of community (especially specific to a server) has been removed for quite a while on retail.
---
You and be both! Although I like dwarf paladin too.
---
How do you update PC specs on blizzard.com?
---
I did that played end of legion start of bfa. Honestly it’s not bad but the never ending gear treadmill gets old. Play the trial at least 1-20.
---
The raceway and Shimmering Flats 😍
---
Would not recommend leveling on retail. End game content is fun for a month or so.
---
For me the way I’m doing it is picking 2 classes that I wanted to play the most.  I’m picking mage as my main and rogue as my alt. I couldn’t decide whether to make rogue my main but if it turns out that I enjoy the rogue more then I will switch to that and have the mage as my alt char
---
What!?
---
- The copyrights on WoW content are still valid. What in the hell leads you to believe Blizzard let *any* of the copyrights on their Warcraft properties expire?
---
- They wouldn't change the dates like that, they'd list the range it's applied; from 2004 - 2019. They're not gonna list future copyright years
---
- Disney hasn't lost the copyrights on *anything*. They've literally shifted US law to hold onto the mouse forever.
---
Playing retail is like playing the first Fifa versus playing fifa 19. 
---
You really can not compare anything in those 2 games anymore. The battles got packed with way more action and fighting 2-4 mobs is mostly not a problem anymore. 
---
You also do not have to use you brain that much to choose what item is better because of the Ilvl (some Azerite traits are better then others but stats wise) and the level system is a joke. Getting a Talent every 15 Levels and none from 110 to 120 is stupid. 
---
Also leveling can be done on a weekend with no problems (i know that you can level in 3days PLAYED in Vanilla but most can not do this). 
---
I would not recommend Retail if you want to choose a Class/Race combo or gettinga feeling for WoW. Best is to try it because you can play for free till lvl 20 and if you buy a sub you can play anything until Legion.
---
No need for a so called “fresh” server more apt for a new player?
---
I’m going to random guess that the prison is the island Varian Wrynn was on until patch 1.9?
---
“Until patch 1.9.0, players could witness the king in his captivity in the sewer dungeons of Alcaz Island just north of Theramore, though he was not involved in any quests at the time. With patch 1.10, Varian was replaced with an elite level 62 myrmidon named Tidelord Rrurgaz and a sewer full of elite naga, and Alcaz Island became home to Doctor Weavil, a major part of the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj world event.”
---
Priest is your safest bet if you want to heal in raids, druids are not very popular for raids.
---
Hunter is your safest bet if you want to farm for your main.
---
He literally said it, for the rep, if a quest turns grey you get reduced rep, if he does it that way a good ammount in each zone will still be green and he'll get more rep, you need exalted with each of your factions' races to buy their mounts (except character race)
---
There was different exp calculator for instances. Something like (elite mob exp of same lvl) *2.5 / (number of party members). Probably my multiplier is wrong but you get idea behind it.
---
Yea I’m using henhouse as a test out for the classes in full potential PvP scenarios it’s fun lol
---
polls are not the same thing as population. historically, hunter has been one of the most played classes. top 3.
---
Tastes just like raisins
---
Yes, as soon as TBC dropped there was a large group of players that started the vanilla server movement.
---
Private servers came, the wall of no happened again and again. Then nost.
---
Well if you are picking a "Druid or priest main ".   
---
My suggestion would be to pick an ALT that can farm gold easy, and fun. Beeing a healer can be expensive, and it is nice to have an alt, that can do what you can not.  
---
From easy to hard goldfarm. Hunter &gt; Rogue &gt; Warlock.
---
It’s an adventure not a grind but I get it enjoy the experience. Be social make friends.
---
I have 4 hours on BFA since launch lmao
---
Healing at first would be good but want to get shadow gear for PvP cause shadows seems like it’s nuts
---
I've seen plenty of bugs reported by streamers.
---
I dig it.
---
There shouldnt be an issue unless the other people dont underatand classic gearing.  Hell, dps warriors at 60 wear some leather.
---
Think ill use that on my application for guilds "Used to have Thunderfury at lvl 33 but gm wouldnt restore it. 10/10 Mythic Molten Core"
---
I'M IN THE BETA BOYS!!! I have no idea which class to play now.
---
If you are still unsure what class you are going to roll, this may be a good opportunity to get a little more input to decide. That’s what I’m going to use the beta for, if I get invited (which I probably won’t be, because I play WoW since 2007 and never got an invite to any beta). 
---
What I’ll do to conserve some nostalgia is playing horde, which I never usually do. When it actually launches I play alliance and a lot of nostalgia comes from the zones, especially the early ones.
---
This is very true. I know hunter can fare well in PvP so the priest/hunter combo is becoming more appealing to me
---
RFC with 25%rest at lvl 16 got 50% of a bar. It’s really only worth it if you have quest.
---
Don’t jinx it please.
---
How is that server? I’m considering going on it
---
I always thought it was some Azshara tower with those cliffs and trees in the background.
---
Does this mean Classic will have modern graphics &amp; new character models?
---
Small pop that’s growing it’s really fun always able to find duels and random wsgs are happening more and more
---
Very
---
What do you mean by 2 versions behind? 
---
There are different types of versioning in software and it differs from the common use of the word patch or version gamers use. 
---
The format is always 3 numbers separated by dots like 2.0.4. 
---
The first number, the Major release version. This only changes with expansions for wow 
---
The second number, Minor releases ( we’d commonly refer to that as the patch, such as 1.12). These change for additional content releases. 
---
The third number, the patch version. This is for everything else, bug fixes, internal code changes and so on. 
---
Whatever build we had in the demo was running 1.13.0, this new beta will be 1.13.2.
---
The x.x.2 difference indicates that they’ve internally moved forward by 2 patch versions. They likely contain all the changes they mentioned after the demo and some more.
---
My point wasn’t about hunters, just that there’s more nuance to warrior play than what it might seem like. Even in PvE, the same players are always considerably higher on DPS than even good/somehwhat skilled players.
---
Good try Blizz, I'm not resubbing just yet!
---
Everthing done in the beta will be wiped and gone
---
No, the beta is for testing the game, not for playing.
---
Stonescale eel =&gt; stonescale oil =&gt; gold
---
No, the game will reset and you will have to level again from scratch, as other players not participating in the beta.
---
Thanks for the content man, makes commuting not so bad!
---
They told me i get to explore a new expansion after i die
---
if I was Blizzard, I would release 8.2 and Classic at the same time and not tell anyone about Classic and see how long it takes for someone to look in the realms list and see Classic realms up. and then drink the salty tears on the forums
---
"reeeeeee why didn't you let us know when it would be released now I'm late on my powerlevelling and won't be able to gank lowbies in Stranglethorn Vale as quickly"
---
I mean... you can literally play anytime you want. Private servers are out there
---
So much salty Alliance noobs in here.
---
Gnome Mage PvP server. I want the world to feel alive and dangerous.
---
yeah and on the +side, its easy to get the leaf quest from MC/Ony. When the other 2-3 main hunters in your guild has there items, its up to grab.  
---
SO you park your althunter outside of MC, when you raid on your main, when your raidleader tell you to log over after Majordomo is dead. they summon you in, you take your item. and leave the raid. Gratz on the free imba item :)
---
Mac got its own Wine, Wineskin, which has pretty good compatibility and performance but I'd still prefer a native solution. Good point though, if it comes down to that I'll definitely go the Wine way.
---
*Are you crazy? There are mobs out there! I'll just stay here and wait for the whole thing to blow ov-* \*spirit healer\*
---
lol, ok dude. I played vanilla starting in 2005. I have played on private servers. The two are not the same, as much as private servers try to emulate them, they get so very much wrong. You won't level to 60 in a week. You are in for a rude awakening.
---
They do work with Macs, but you need a recent mac (post 2012) because the older graphic cards did not support Metal which is a new graphic API (think about DirectX)
---
Not to be confused by Feign Death in Molten Core and use goblin jumpercables to prevent a raid runback. That's actually useful.
---
I saw a Goon Squad there, I messaged the player and asked if they were from SA, they replied back in Russian with lots of “?????”
---
One of my best memories in WoW was getting there with a few of my friends. (finding stuff like that was one on my passions)  
---
I was so sad when I tried to return there and found out that the game now teleported you out of the zone whenever you tried to step foot in the region :(
---
.....
---
I work in software development, I understand the terminology. If you go back and watch/read press releases on Classic Demo, the version of the game that was the demo wasn't their most up to date version. It was, iirc, two versions behind their internal build of the game.
---
I was honestly expecting a static client - at least somewhat, so it being 8.x infrastructure is a surprise to me, and shows what I know.  
---
    
---
I didn't jump down anyone's throat though :p
---
FAIL
---
Both of them are horde.
---
Yes. And if you get bored staying at 60, start playing the regular game.
---
In the very least it would be a slap in the face of the developers/game director of retail, it might even wake them up a bit. Doubt it though since they haven't been able to listen to what's basically been consensus of what makes retail terrible.
---
Duobox practicing.
---
If you're hyped for beta how come you're not just playing on a private server already?
---
Only problem would be if the healing shaman is picking up dps leather. It's generally considered poor form to step outside your role for gear in later levels since people are converging on their end game specs and working on their pre-raid. Enhance shaman or any spec of hunter? Those leather pieces are fair game.
---
Not at all! Just like how holy paladins and shaman will roll on cloth/leather
---
okay got that but do you think the old macs will run the game good enough..... i know it is Vanilla but i had less frames in the blizzcon demo then on pserver (still enough but it was noticeable)
---
what about "We Pee in Moonwells"? I've seen them recently on the PTR.
---
"Recently" means 6.2.5 :D
---
As a druid, you can do the HotW build and it will allow you to heal or tank, and farming isn't bad either. Thorns, regrowth/rejuv, then basically swipe down 5 mobs.
---
Shadow priests are reallllllly strong, pretty hard to kill too.
---
Idk much about shamans.
---
Not every quest item is like that in vanilla. On pserv maybe, but i remember quick looting quest items from back in a day before other party members could. Eg. Bandanas in stockade, mechano parts in gnomeg etc. Heads of quest "bosses" are however lootable by all. Or items starting quest.
---
An ele/resto hybrid spec is actually super viable in PvP, and farms at a decent pace.
---
During the first weeks, there will be so many people running around that everything will be killed the moment it spawns. As I said before, if you got more people you can cover a larger area.
---
Yep that was it and yes she was solo able once you killed off her children.
---
I didn’t even think of this. That’s dope. Yea priest may be a solid main with hunter alt for wpvp/farming
---
and I hope they enable that in Classic. Because you see... it's endangered, as on retail, you can't see others' say during flight
---
Me too. We're almost there friend. We're almost home.
---
in vanilla, as long as you are polite, it shouldnt matter. Rolling on Agi gear for a hunter is the norm. Agi / Stam/ Att power are the stats you need. 
---
Some of the pre raid BiS gear for hunters was leather gear  (although mainly crafted leather).  But up until level 60, I wouldnt worry about rolling on any agi /stam gear if it is better than what you are wearing. 
---
Dont be an ass about it through....Generally I roll need on a blue, and if I get it, I'd wait to roll need on another good item, unless nobody else rolled need.  Kinda like "1 good upgrade an instance". 
---
But lower than 60, most groups will be pugs, so be nice and say its an upgrade. Dont think anyone will have an issue with you rolling need. If they do, maybe they have an issue. 
---
Also, if you are in Pugs when 60, then again, as long as its an upgrade, roll need. Believe me, Warriors and Rogues will roll on stuff you want.
---
I wanna emphasise that "there is some speculation" refers to *some* people proposing it's necessary because popular pservers did it. 
---
I wanna repeat what I previously wrote: 
---
Ion said specifically that they do not want to apply today's problemsolving to Classic. That's it. The goal isn't to release a better, perfect Classic - the goal is to replicate it as close to the past as possible. Blizzard knows that this has certain consequences, but it's a necessary evil.
---
They cannot possibly make the value of gold in Vanilla match the value gold will have in Classic. Way more people are aware of gold making guides, the average age of players will presumably be tremendously higher (i.e. a better average understanding of finances), etc etc.
---
If they want to stand to their word, they will not touch ANY farming method. Players will just have to deal with the fact that gold will have slightly less value (in AH) in Classic. People playing the AH will be able to charge more gold for the same items, it's that simple. It also means that getting the epic mount will be a little easier in general, even for people who aren't hunters, as they willl get more revenue from selling stuff.
---
Doesn’t exist on retail.
---
Not *entirely* correct. Most (decent) guilds run with extremely active tanks, and they'll run with around 2-3 tanks and the rest will be Fury warriors who occasionally pick up an add. The only way to get in is to go Fury or hope one of the tanks gets booted. Those spots are very hard to come by.
---
Exactly. If it's a closed beta someone like me can likely get in and know what I'm doing, and do things as intended. They need people like my sister who does things no one could ever predict and casually glitch her way through closed off areas in darn near any game just because "I thought I had to go that way."
---
Eh you will have an easier time getting away as a druid. They're more handy in groups too. You can't vanish a dot. Most of the time if you get jumped as a rogue either you're gonna outplay the guy or you're gonna die. Most people will dot/bleed/faerie fire/etc to deny the restealth.
---
As a druid it doesn't matter, you can 100% get away.
---
And that's bad?
---
If 15 dollars a month is something you have to put any thought into what so ever don’t do it and save your money buddy lol
---
100% bad
---
Dunno why you're getting downvoted. This is correct.
---
Where is that gnomish smile?
---
Emerald Dream has been in the files since vanilla tho, and im pretty sure that blizzard is using a recovered core
---
How will you be able to download Beta from the Blizzard Launcher? Will it be an option under the Account/Region drop down menu OR will you have to select the BfA option and download that first?  I'm not a current sub but have been on and off for every expansion since vanilla so I'm hoping to get into Beta when it releases and want to be ready.  Can I get some guidance from you all based on previous Beta releases?  Thanks!!
---
Not sure. It's published by Brady Games 2005. My guess is that it's out of print. Maybe eBay?
---
No one knew what they were doing back then, even in the cinematics.
---
Spirit only helps out of combat and wont buff ur mp5 during fights. If you spec into ele tree without getting nature swiftness from resto tree you become a glass canon without the canon part. Obviously you should test these out yourself and do what you enjoy but if you wanted to be competitive the best option is resto build. Its arguably better than enh and ele specs pvp and the only real option pve. Windfurying people down in 1 button press never gets old but auto attacking without wf proc sure does. 1h enh spec owns melee but gimped vs.caster. ele is fun but easily countered with a counterspell or stunlock. If you get ironfoe your basically taking a bwl quality wep for a pvp spec ull rarely use, will definitely want to fill your own grp for that one ;) I wouldn't say any of your plan is stupid, but cost of respeccing... ele and enh being glass canon memes... and the battle mage ele enh spec being underpowered I think show it wont work as you hoped. Sham still awesome, dont get discouraged. Rsham is my favorite pvp class above op hunter, op mage, sneaky rog, full dots n ded warlock. Nothing beats purging shields and bursting dmg as a pvp healer. Again do what you enjoy, maybe you'll come across the next sham meta pvp build.
---
Everything is crossrealm nowadays anyway so the sense of community is gone entirely.
---
I play wow 40h a week 15$ is chump change when you get so much out of a game.
---
Another duplicate thread
---
Imo, you are not paying for Wow: Classic, you are paying for World of Warcraft in general, what part of it you play is up to you.
---
r/nocontext
---
Oh the days of nuking the AH with Baron Bombs on pets.
---
Thats probably the worst decision they can do as a company. Unecessarily stressfull and also increasing the competition between their own 2 titles.
---
Its NEVER going to happen.
---
Yeah I got into the BfA alpha when I was unsubbed.  Same with Legion if I recall. Been playing since 2004, I think they do it to try and pull you back in.
---
I can't wait for bears in Silverpine Forest to chase me from Tirisfal all the way to Hillsbrad again!
---
I thought it was around 4-5m at the end of vanilla and it grew up to like 7-9 during tbc and peaked at 12 or something during wotlk? I remember that graph floating around but maybe Im remembering wrong
---
Although I think the shit show would be fun, like honestly. I think for new players coming to classic spending 2 hours trying to get one quest done could really deter them. I think sharding in the 1-5 (northshire/valley of trails) and possibly 5-10 zones would not be a terrible idea, at least at launch. We want new players to have fun and want join the community, a bad first impression could seriously hurt the game. 
---
TL;DR yes sharding at launch imo
---
My wife didn't start playing until BC, so I'm looking forward to leveling with her in Classic.
---
I play in a duo we are killing even if it’s not for quest.
---
Whining about sharding is so last month...
---
Not soon enough
---
must be a dwarf, such hangover
---
Completely hung over. Must be dwarves.
---
I feel like the huge classic aspect, server specific society, will take severe hit with sharding. Also the "GATES ARE OPEN" -mass rush of people is part of the experience, part of the hype. It is like the beginning of festival, it will ease up pretty quickly after some time. Let the somewhat frustraiting, but cool beginning happen the way it will. Dont try to control it.
---
Can confirm, downvoted.
---
But competition against who? You have 1 Sub. If you play game A or game B is irrelevant for a company.
---
You can play 100 of games on Origin for 1 Sub.
---
They don't care if you play Sims or Battlefield as long as their get their subs.
---
And as far as I can tell from this Reddit, there are tons of people with no sub currently. Isn't that money they would want ASAP?
---
I played pserver for prepping for classic. I want to play retail to see for myself how different it is.
---
A lot of old players hadn't heard of private servers until the release announcement, myself included.  I'm waiting for the real thing
---
Why are PvPers always so cringy?
---
Even though it would remove me from the pool I like this idea.  I gave my first account away to a friend since I was “quitting”, so my original vanilla account is no longer in my hands.
---
Classic will use the same client (with appropriate changes for Classic) as current WoW is using. If it doesn't support your machine, Classic won't either.
---
They know about you and your machine (I mean people like you :). They have decided it's not worth supporting. Your options are either buying a new computer, using Windows or Wine.
---
My guild lost like half players after first tier not to mention people missing from Legion. Right now it's a dissaster. I played a bit after launch and first tier, a bit on the second tier and now I'm not. People say that WoD had no conent but BfA has content that you don't want to even touch. 8.2 has some interesting changes but IMHO it's 8.2 and not 8.0 - many people, including me don't really care, don't trust and see this patch through a prism "more and more grinds to keep you subbed while the game won't really change". Even JoshPriest from Method, the world first guild/raid group clearly says he hates the game and hates playing it and would gladly quit it... but they still make good raids ;) Many WoW streamers/content creators went ESO or just stopped with WoW. Retail WoW YT videos perform really poorly this expansion too while random Kargoz vanilla prep stream gets close to 1k viewers just like that ;)
---
When 8.2 launches there will be an intro quest chain, that at max 1-2h, then do +10 for weekly if it won't be capped at +6/7 like last time (also depends what ilvl inflation will happen making curretn 410-415 gear still top or already trash before raid). So patch 8.2 will have like 3h of gameplay and will want to bribe you into rep grinding (in new zones only) and alike by teasing new carrots for the neck - so that you spend time in game and you are subbed. After raid launch at around 3-4 reset progression will be done, as all high ilvl gear will be acquired and anything more will be completely pointless. Then wait for 8.3 will begin. Cool.
---
On the other hand I care about Classic daily, plus I still have a guild on a pserver and we want to finish some progression before Classic launch. For me as a retail player (started on Legion pre-patch) retail WoW will auto loose to Classic if I would have to choose what to play at given time.
---
Presumably, the token won't be a physical item in classic. So you could only trade it in BFA, or apply it for game time towards both games.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/zuWNUXB.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/zuWNUXB.jpg) 
---
Wasn't that the Saurfang scene from BfA prepatch or something?
---
The only characters carrying over will be those who rolled westfall lamps.
---
I got my entire guild killed from C'thun by stepping into the hallway while we were stacked. I blamed it on a cat (that I didn't actually have) jumping on my keyboard. Whoops.
---
No you keep your lvl 60 then when the game comes out ya go str8 to Redridge purging the Alliance filth.
---
It doesn't really matter what server you play on imo. Just pick whatever you want to, or just use the one, your characters are on. I would recommend to level to 120 (if you own bfa) and try some of the endgame content, as it is fun for a few weeks. I did the same and played a race / class that doesn't exist in classic to a) try something new and b) not let the experience (doesn't matter if good or bad) ruin my classic gameplay experience.
---
Interesting.  I always thought they released the demo with certain features intact to gauge response (dungeon finder tab) and to make it less shocking for the retail crowd who decided to give it a try (accelerated regeneration)
---
Haha I wish. I meant more on my off nights
---
LOL
---
Yes, I have. I am considering a female Tauren druid for classic, so I rolled one up on a pserver recently to check out the animations. I thought they looked good.
---
The worst thing about sharding is its so fucking aggressive on retail servers.
---
it feels like as soon as the 11th person enters a zone they go on a new shard.
---
blizzards sharding is pretty crap , not to mention vanilla is suppose to have several world events that all include pvp
---
general pvp, world dragons, aq event these th8ngs dont really work with sharding.
---
The other main thing i hate about sharding is if i see a dude i want to know he is 9n my fucking server. 
---
in retail wow wyen you do see a handfull of people in that zone you are farming what server are they even on
---
for that matter wtf shard or server am i even on.
---
Blizzard could have worked on sharding and improved it , say if sharding only kicked in when there was 500 or 1000 people in a signle small zone. but it always felt like blizz onlybever made the sharding tech more and more agressive . heaven forbid a few hundred people be in the same zone better whisp them away so they can play the mmo alone.
---
Right yea thanks of course it makes no sense for it to carry over and giving everyone on the beta a major advantage
---
Can you let us know which server you're going to be in when the list releases? Seems like it will be a good one to pick alliance on.
---
&gt; you can cancel ice block
---
Shhh. They don't need to know that
---
My apologies for the long winded explanation! 
---
It would make sense, IIRC looking as the scraped CDN from last night, “classic wow” got a new build after the demo, and this classic wow beta is two versions ahead of that.
---
I’m at work so can’t manually check to see if I’m right
---
Farch
---
Yikes, left-handed mouse user.
---
That's because of phasing and shards and crap though right?
---
I’ve got a second question to add to this: how do you know which item is better for your hunter in this case, given that you’ll have a significant drop in armor? I know that armor won’t be crucial for a hunter, but at some point there’s gotta he a trade off, right? If I roll on leather gloves to replace my mail ones, is it beneficial to get +2 agility at the cost of -120 armor?
---
I definitely hear you on that one. And I guess if you aren't ruining it for anyone else, it isn't so bad to roll on RP. IDK, I don't have any perfect solutions.
---
If there are gold sellers, I think they're gonna be on all realms though, so going RP won't get you away from them. I guess idiots in chat may be cracked down on harder on RP, which could make a difference.
---
The numbers extend beyond the subscription. They want as many as possible playing both so its way better to spread out the hype for each and not let them collide. When they pitch &amp; sell to investors they mention a lot more than the sub-numbers.
---
worst healer ever
---
explain please
---
I wouldn't call that "phasing" and "sharding" if I see them right behind my back, and they respond to /w, but not to /s
---
Two secrets lol well played
---
MC will be done in pugs no problem. Once there's a lot of 60s running around I bet there will some setting up to go every evening.
---
I will repost something like this with the name of the realm we’ll pick yes. But if they allow multi char on different realm we’ll go with Alts on other realms too.
---
Hunters, not a problem.
---
The shaman is an asshole though, since all he gets is a miniscule amount of crit dodge armor, remember shaman gain AP from strength in vanilla. 
---
If there's a rogue, Hunter or kitty in the party let them have it first. 
---
Strength weapons and jewerly though? Go nuts
---
What about World of Warcraft?
---
Warriors are easy to play imo
---
It's definitely not hacking I'll admit that! But people having such anticipation for the game that they're finding ways (security breach or not) to access the client before it's formally released (ie 90% of us don't know how to get to that screen, so while it's public it's not THAT public lol).
---
I dno, that sounds like his comment to me, without a bit of exaggeration.
---
Not at all = 0%, exactly = 100%, his is somewhere between the two numbers to me :)
---
Yeah, I remember reading lots of disappointed posts when people suddenly found out that WoW stopped working on their Macs.
---
Guess I'll download the trial version of latest WoW and see how it runs under Wine.
---
That is correct. There was even a difference between the patch being run on the physical Blizzcon test PCs and the patch that we digital ticket testers got to play.
---
And remember to group up with nearby people who may be on the same quest, if only for a few minutes! Way more efficient for 5 people to work on getting the 20 harvest watcher kills together.
---
Nah, they straight came out and said don't worry about anything you see that shouldn't be there, we're just not finished yet. ( to them, disabling a button on the UI is small compared to internal code changes required)
---
"SWORD IN MY HAND, AXE BY MY SIDE, VALHALLA AWAITS ME WHEN I DIE!"
---
Which is fine. The only reason I want to play is to have a base for comparison.
---
HOLY.SHIT
---
Prob doing something else with his right hand...
---
Ahahah glad people got my joke!
---
An Undead with magic bones rotating around gets creeped out by a normal-looking picture - the irony.
---
then do it, the first 20 levels are totally free and then you only need a Sub and can play until end of legion.
---
the idea of buying the expansion to just go do the crappy raids a couple of times does not interest me.
---
i purchased the last expansion and didnt play that i wont be buying this one
---
I will play some of my old characters a little for the memories, but they will be stuck at whatever the old level cap is forever 
---
i actually wish i didnt buy last expansion because i had really good gear the expansion before that , maybe ill do some twink shit on retail when classic is out
---
I don’t own BfA and don’t really want to pay for it. So I will be able to play up to Legion? Hopefully there is still some folks doing 5 man stuff for that.
---
Your mind is set, only a fool tries to change that mind of a man who wont
---
Mate, it's gonna be may...
---
Priest would be a solid cap on that group
---
I can confirm, I am already doing it with the current game I am playing, "reFRESHing reddit".
---
Hunters go nuts.
---
Shaman dont gain AP from agi, like warriors they get 2 AP from str. 
---
Keep off agi drops stick to str/pure AP leather and its fine, go wild on str weapons and jewerly
---
How would looting work in a PUG MC group? Everyone just rolls on what is BIS for them?
---
haha love it. I plan to fish when i'm at work....cant get away with questing, but could max level fish 15-20 mins here / there.....also its a good wee gold maker for me.
---
Just a daily reminder
---
Alliance &gt; Horde
---
He's not trying to be super optimized, he's saying he's not very good at PVP and wants something that can put out some numbers even if it's not played at a high skill level (assuming he wants to DPS). A huge amount of hunter's damage comes from autos and pet alone, you don't have to be optimized to put out decent damage. Especially if he's playing with the control of a mage and lock, he'll have a lot of freedom to just sit back and shoot. Even if solo though, hunters have a very basic strategy in PVP with pretty much every matchup, keep enemy at range and shoot.
---
Inb4 reddit rolls alliance on Ops server and makes him and his shitty guild uninstall.
---
If the stats work for you, why not - unless it's someone else's BiS, why not?
---
On the flip side, I've been in raids where I won leather gear over classes who could equip mail. But that wasn't my call.
---
Check out Kargiz on twitch/YouTube.  He does quite a bit of theory crafting on group leveling.  If you just want the numbers on how the so works I'm sure a quick google can provide that for ya.
---
Hey mate I recommend checking out Kargoz YouTube channel. He goes into depth on general levelling of each class as well as the exp co-efficient based upon party size etc. 👍
---
I hope not. Blizzard betas are not gaming industry standard betas.
---
They are there for find bugs/mistakes and test that it actually works. Not a demo.
---
There's a reason for the last 2 retail expansions they have prioritized beta invites for high end raiding guilds. For Legion and BfA beta, pretty much all of the top 100 guild raiders got invited in the first few waves of alpha/beta. 
---
They want people who can actually test stuff, not random sightseers in the beta at least initially.
---
It's the nature of the quest. If anyone not on the quest gets on the threat table of the demon the quest will reset. Which is why they made it against the rules to do so as it can effectively be used to grief anyone doing it with no recourse.
---
Obligatory "you think you do but you don't." Although I have to say I personally really don't.
---
My daughter did fine with a druid on pserv she was 9 and it was her first time playing wow... she was already used to WSAD movement though from other games... I think the amount of utility you gain from playing a druid and you can learn alot from that one class is worth it for a beginner....   
---
you can learn to melee/cast dps, heal and tank... plus you get some cc mechanics, sprint, stealth, other movement bonuses...
---
No. No they won't
---
Check out Perringaidens comment. He got it!
---
zero percent chance
---
That's just stupid
---
Yeah, start watching now.  There are a lot of episodes and since it's the last season, there are only 5 weeks until the finale.  You'd be able to watch it all in a month probably and be there for the finale with everyone else.
---
Not a chance
---
Yes with an active subscription you can play up to level 110 and do the legion content. I don't know how many people do that though, sorry.
---
First time I saw it got turned on, still do.
---
That sounds like a disaster. Holy shit.
---
Nope never happend at any Alpha/Beta from blizz and would not make much sense
---
I’ve only gotten it when I’ve been subbed. Not sure what their criteria is.
---
If mobility is the only consideration I would say druid. Bot nothing in vanilla is as mobile as a DH.
---
Everyone talking about getting ahead of the pack. I plan to get behind the pack and let the try hards rush out of the starting zones and start flooding the market with cheap items. :)
---
There was a hunter in my guild who would j not ever melee. I only ever healed them with bandages.
---
Your co-worker is wrong.
---
Hearthstone and HotS are not RPGs. It like comparing apples and coat-hangers.
---
Lol, you're acting like there's limited space or something.  This is straight up /r/gatekeeping.
---
There are enough quests, it's just that people don't know how to the level-up process works in vanilla. You don't complete a zone and then move to the next one. You go back and forth and don't try to do red or even some orange quests. You may need to come back to an area maybe 3 or even 4th time. Grinding mobs in certain stages of the leveling process is very adviseable as there are mobs that are easy to kill, there are a lot of them and they drop nice stuff.
---
There should be a system scanner somewhere in there. That’s how they’ve done it in the past.
---
i would say Hunter because speed buff and you can keep mobs away from you. Rogue is only fast if you skill sub.
---
You would look at people who have previously been involved with testing on WoW retail, or possibly other blizzard titles, and let them in.
---
Nothing comes even close to DH in terms of mobility 
---
Maybe rogues but only for like 30 seconds of sprint 
---
And Druids
---
Smart move. This is exactly what my wife and I did, with slight differences in class choice.
---
Public game betas and pre-release demos are almost always a couple months behind the internal builds regardless of the dev.
---
It has its own client? 
---
I thought it'd be part of the current wow client, with new servers on which Vanilla only would run.
---
That demo was literally just whoever paid to get in. That has no relation to their needs for actual testing.
---
Report forums bugs to show them your grit /s
---
They could just not release how many people are playing each.
---
this is going to sound like sacrilege but as a person who only cares about raiding i prefer leveling in some of the more recent wow versions (dont own this xpac)
---
a few expansions back they made leveling as a prot warrior super fun with aoe and stuff , forget what xpac it was about 4 back when prot leveling became super viable that was the most ive ever enjoyed leveling lol.
---
I think my favourite raids were BC
---
You can always heal as ele, same goes with ret/prot pala with int gear. You will have problems when you group is shit (no sheep, no sap, no cc in general) but even as a resto you would then have problems ;)
---
But this requires there to be enough mobs in supply to be quicker. If there aren't enough mobs for everyone then it is slower for the group questers.
---
when you upgrade to BFA, you pay the money and then you can play right away. no download time. you already have the data from installing WoW. when you install WoW, it installs EVERYTHING. but you have to pay extra for the latest expansion to be unlocked.
---
so when you sub to WoW to play Classic, realize that ALL the data for ALL expansions is going to be on your hard drive whether you like it or not. get a bigger hard drive. (or don't play)
---
They removed the option to manually submit your pc specs when they moved over to the battle.net app, which automatically checks your specs when you launch it.
---
The first picture is an error when trying to run it, the second is the working login screen meaning they fixed the error that he was getting at first... I think.
---
Thank you for not marking the Battle For Azeroth beta as "ongoing".
---
&gt;Tldr: what's in it for me?
---
Look kids, a twat.
---
Wow talk about nostalgic. I can remember me and my brother use to watch this video all the time!! Every time I hear We be burning by Sean Paul I think of this video!
---
Nah, they used to do some crazy stuff back in classic. Although you are right, it does sound very dream-like.
---
But beta isn't really the real thing is it
---
Did you ever encounter a problem or bug on your personal account and immediately solve it on your next shift, or did you have to create a ticket and wait in queue for days like everyone else?
---
Yeah i am totally fine with people like the new combat system, new raid mechanics and so on. 
---
I think the game just got totally diffrent after Cata (maybe Wotlk was the start) so if you would let a Classic only player play retail he would not like it and the other way around.
---
&gt;Start a Night Elf, take boat to Wetlands, swim to X spot and drown. Rez at the Dun Morogh graveyard to play with a friend playing Dwarf.
---
I am intrigued! I played vanilla and never knew you could die in Wetlands and spawn in Dun Morogh. Is there a certain area you need to perform this at?
---
It's still the biggest non-f2p mmo on the market. I don't get why people act like it's dead and gone, it's still very much alive.
---
Haha...lol...huhu...eww.../gently_sobs
---
I did this recently for a month just to farm gold so that when classic comes out i will have enough to buy 3 free months of time.
---
Try. Pleasure will be mine.
---
the healer had agro u moron.kek

---
Yeah I think there are multiple variables involved, almost seems random.
---
By the time DH was released in legion the game was already steeped in heavy mobility creep. In order to make DH feel like 'the' mobile class they had to go even farther above and beyond the normal already very high mobility classes.
---
Nothing in vanilla is even remotely in the same ballpark mobility wise as DH. Druid is probably the most mobile, but don't expect it to feel like a DH.
---
&gt;Vanilla Open Beta : 14 days

&gt;Vanilla Closed Beta : Roughly a year
---
I think it was like 3 months or something in Europe
---
I do prefer alliance as well, specifically human just because the armor looks the best on them and they naturally quest towards my favourite quest area: duskwood.
---
I'm no hardcore player so I don't care about min/max choices considering racials, but no human hunters :(
---
I mean, you can just use [this](https://classicdb.ch/?spells=11) to go profession by profession and check what it can make.
---
Hey! I once got perma banned when I traded my friend some gold on his new character. They thought I was selling gold or something. I wrote a support ticket and they unbanned me, but how could this happen with no actually evidence, a game masters first day at the job? Hah!
---
The publicity from streamers being in a beta is pretty huge, not to mention they get thousands of extra eyes on potential bugs they may encounter while they play *and* those bugs are automatically recorded by the streaming service.
---
What do you do now?
---
I randomly got a beta invite to Diablo 3, didn't even know it was in development.
---
Classic: 88 days
---
Beta: April 19th, 2019
---
Release date: July 16th, 2019
---
Now I hope I'm right
---
The only reason to do this would be to break new records of nerd-rage on the internet and completely alienate huge swaths of their intended player base. So I’m going with no fucking chance on this one.
---
Depends on what you mean by decent I guess. If you want to be a high level hunter, sure there's a lot to master, but hunters at a base skill level are a lot more effective than most other classes at a base skill level in PVP imo
---
Tell him that hes a fucking idiot.
---
Laugh 
---
Laugh loudly
---
Laugh loudly on their faces
---
&gt; TL;DR CLASSIC IS A REALM TYPE, NOT A SEPARATE GAME.
---
I sure hope that's not the case. It would imply the same launcher icon and login screen. Pretty sure its gonna have its own classic client that only connects to classic realms.
---
Hey..... we are people too... kind of.... :(
---
I hope you're a little off, like a month or so🙏
---
Good info. I doubt my wife will ever be raiding or even doing dungeons without me. It’s more of an activity we can do together for a couple months and have fun with. 
---
Thanks for your comment!
---
If you are going to have friends to play with (healers) or you want to participate in premades then go warrior. If you think you will be doing more solo pvp and you have no interest in premades then go rogue.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=290177/thottbot-visual-theme-now-live-on-classic-wowhead-site
---
no chance in hell of that ever happening
---
Elemental, just because your main level stats will then fit to both levelup dps AND healing in instances.  You dont need to gather 2 completely different sets.
---
Usuaully main-spec only rolls allowed with /roll and the Loot Master who is running the PUG (or assigned by the raid leader) will hand things out based on those rolls and knowing the classes of the people involved.
---
The original version is just a video with a still image while the other two seem to recorded from the client running. I wouldn't be surprised if the original version is a high quality rip from the [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQFOLOur1jM). Then there are other factors to consider when recording, editing and uploading a video like compression. It's really hard to tell the difference from a YouTube video. There's no reason why the 1.12 client used on private servers be any different than the "original" since the client itself is literally the original client.
---
yeah its just a different game now vanilla and retail are pretty much like vanilla and guild wars 2
---
Armor types are largely irrelevant in most cases, if it's got better stats for your class, roll away bud.  Seeing pallies in cloth wasn't that unusual.
---
However the one role where armor type definitely matters is if you're a tank.  Obviously
---
ummm...Warriors roll on leather dps gear as BIS so....
---
Yeah great remarks. 
---
I thinks it's more like gameplay wise. Like great mobility compared to other class and hit and run glass canon type.
---
I can summon tissues if others will help click the box
---
Damn I used to have that atlas. Not sure what happened to it.
---
Your co worker is low IQ. Show him this comment
---
&gt; Thoughts on sharding? 
---
Might want to do a search, theres like thousand posts about it.
---
Me as well. What are you going to roll when it drops?
---
Please do not open retail if you are pre-cata WoW player, that 6-8button end game pvp will ruin your experience and memories to how skillcap WoW used to be. Retail? No need to roll for items, everyone have healing, no mana management needed, such a casual kidnapped game it is lately, boooom smash the buttons without anything in relation to those abilities. And wtf are these talents? Suuuuure! 
---
No please do not open retail, I did it on free weekend and friend shown me the endgame pvp on his acc, such a shitshow it was.
---
That last number is more likely build version. Think about it that they recompiled the code somewhere around 2k times during development and testing.
---
That's not how that works... Why are people upvoting you?
---
Please use the What Should I Play (WSIP) Wednesdays posts (can find old ones on the right sidebar) for questions about what character you should play. Thank you!
---
Hunters, I'm all for #nochanges but for real blizz could pretend hunters never existed and I'd be fine with that. Paladins too.
---
Correct
---
What mike said.
---
Your older bro was a pally tank. But you were a shaman. Was he a druid? Are you ashamed of his bear farts?
---
Same here! I started a month before BC. I'm really excited to play Classic as well.
---
Level as enhance and just keep some INT gear in your bag for healing.
---
... are you trolling me?
---
Looks like Deviant Delight. That's what its called, right? Turns you into a pirate.
---
Especially once main raiding guilds are hitting AQ20/40 type raiding, with only BWL being a farm night (having dropped MC from the schedule entirely).
---
May see MT's or OT's from guilds who don't run MC anymore participating in MC runs just for more chances at bindings if they got unlucky on drops.
---
Lol, I'm a twat for not wanting to play a beta? Ok
---
Please use the What Should I Play (WSIP) Wednesday posts for this type of question. They're stickied every Wednesday and old ones can be found on the right sidebar. Thank you.
---
Warrior with a pocket healer and a bonus DPS will be a deadly combo in PVP. Instant dungeon groups as a bonus too.
---
The fourth longer one?
---
This is the news I came here looking for.  I probably won't be playing the beta for long, if at all.  WoW is a grind and I don't want to spend time in the beta when I'm going to spend so much time when it comes out.
---
I think the release date shouldn't be far off from the beta period though.  Maybe four months from now?  That'd put it around the end of August.
---
Nothing in vanilla is highly mobile outside of some hunter feign death icetrap tricks. Rogues have sprint but unless they get talents in combat it's like a 3 min CD. 
---
The closest to dh would be a rogue but that's only because swords and leather.
---
There is no sharing of drops. You realize that, do you?
---
\*has a low IQ.  
---
IQ is not a state of being.
---
Wouldn't it be cool if Blizzard let you pay for a "pet" of your current toon to run beside you in Classic? I'd have a BE Paladin with me.
---
Guilds break up for a myraid of reasons, and usually it is some sort of power struggle between the guild leadership and a handful of people who think they can do it  better.  Usually a  loot system that is clear, consistent and transparent makes it so loot distribution isn't one of those reasons. 
---
Keep in mind that there are different kinds of DKP systems and some may seem more "fair" than others.
---
I don't like bid type dkp systems because I don't think they are transparent. There is a lot of room for abuse and collusion of such a system. On surface it might make sense that items will cost more the first time they drop, but there is room for unrest where biases could pop up where people think officers get items cheaper or some other such thing, especially if bids are private whispers vs in the guild chat.
---
The truest most reasonable dkp system is zero sum. It takes the most work because every item that could possible drop in the raid is assigned a static dkp value prior to the raids starting. Obviously some thought needs to go into how items are "priced", but the rule we tried to follow back in 2005 was that set items cost less then rings/necklaces/trinkets and weapons cost the most. The DKP spent at the raid, was the dkp earned by the raid.  (so if 400 dkp was spent and there were 40 raiders then  everyone got 10 dkp for the night.
---
Another option may be a loot reel/suicide kings type method, where when you get an item you must spend all DKP (go to the bottom of the reel).
---
A good loot system rewards participation and some do these better than others. You want to gear up your raid quickly, and in a fair and organized manner.  However, all of the loot systems mentioned have their own set of problems that can cause any one to point at it and say it's "unfair". What matters is that you choose one, you stick with it, and you execute it with no exceptions.  When you do that, then people come to realize that the loot system is what it is, and despite whatever flaws it has, they know what to expect, how to plan, and that it is what it is. When some one new comes along or begins to question the system it is easy and valid to point out that the loot rules are clear within the guild and will not be changing so either deal with it or find a guild with loot rules you like better.
---
You’re right
---
No. - 10% chance.
---
I did this while healing SM Cathedral. I ate as fast as I could and when I finished everyone was still waiting for me lol
---
It will be a lot closer than P server.          
---

---
             
---
I like P. Servers because it's the best around at the moment but its fucking wonky as shit sometimes and feels a little off.
---
I duno, I'm torn on the issue. There's good arguments for both sides, but in the end as long as they don't ruin the experience it wont be a make or break issue for most. 
---
I feel like there is a reasonable balance Blizzard can hit that will make zones feel very populated while still allowing people to complete their quests. 
---
It's probably going to be a combination of *very light* sharding combined with some implementation of dynamic respawns. As long as they don't go overboard with it and they dash some smart dynamic respawns in there you can probably come up with a formula that allows zones to feel very populated while not making the game unplayable.
---
I think if you have any of this past the first week or 2 at max people wont be happy though.
---
Was GM island a real thing and were there any other secret spots? Particularly ones no one ever found?
---
This made me feel warm inside. Sounds like you had a really wholesome time there!
---
Dang same here
---
Of course I am. I'm also the coworker.
---
Just play the no sub version, level a toon 1-20 and you will see just from that how different it is. Entirely different game.
---
Or just, hit the button again.
---
Nothing comes close to DH, but the top 4 most mobile are probably these:  
---
1. Druid  
---
2. Mage/Hunter  
---
3. Rogue  
---
4. Enhancement Shaman with improved Ghost Wolf
---
Were you being serious about the beta carrying over?
---
Beta testing always has limited space when it comes to wow. And it’s meant for testing bugs. All I said is that, if you are only playing the beta to get early access, don’t bother. We all want a smooth game. 
---
So often when games do beta people treat it as early access and don’t actually test or report bugs. Then the game releases and it’s a buggy mess for everyone. I’m not gatekeeping at all. I’m asking those who have no intention to actually test for bugs to let those who will test do it.
---
Bet him as much money as he'll take on it. It's a guaranteed win.
---
Funny meme, 10/10 gatekeeping. Your gonna get bored first hour and be sitting in org staring at world chat like the rest of us buddy.
---
Porthmail new epic crafting set confirmed.
---
Nomi confirmed
---
aight, thanks
---
Can someone go into more detail about what happened with this “plague”?
---
Sell the Mac, build a PC. Budget rig if you are cheep. Don't plea with Blizzard and expect them to have this fixed by release because you are probably in for a disappointment. 
---
I get you are happy with your Mac, but the cold hard truth is there's a good reason why the vast majority of gamers prefer PC. There much more support for it and you get much more control over your system.
---
If you're looking for mobility in movement gameplay it is Hunter. 
---
Rogue only got Sprint every 3minute.
---
Mobility in class specilization, it is for sure druid in healing, dps and tanking.
---
Although none of the vanilla classes even comes close to DH mobility. For her it is going to feel like running all game instead of fly Mount.
---
Good day.
---
It's been a while but I may have used a trial account to create a character on the opposite faction and /who them to see if they were still online or in the same area. That's the worst thing I can think of. I didn't have any friends on the opposite faction nor did I direct contact with the victim. 
---
I checked through old e-mails and couldn't find anything aside from getting a warning for somehow killing players on my own faction with a fire nova totem bug of some sort lol.
---
The only true mobility skill that you have as a Rogue is a short sprint, with a couple of minutes CD
---
That is all. I mean it's better than nothing, but it's not like they are the Kings of mobility.
---
Why does the copyright in the middle say "2004 - 2018"?  Is this a total fake?
---
I was. It has happened in Blizzard's past, so there is precedent. Is it likely? Probably not, but I wasn't thinking about that while trying to convince my coworker that he should sign up for the beta, and stop whining/worrying about getting burnout before the actual release.
---
Much like your posting.
---
You under estimate the power of the wand my friend.
---
I feel this is a fair way of doing it still, who ever made the effort to contribute and pay for the demo should be ahead of the queue for the beta. (Incomming hate messages)
---
Absolutely 0 percent chance.
---
Ops, never mind folks, found some good threads already asking this question ;)
---
That's a pretty good idea.
---
I will probably try to figure out how many wands i could possibly need, then go for enchanting up to the second "tier" craftable wands (The lvl13 one) and stockpile up on them.
---
Then i ditch enchanting and go for whatever i originally wanted...so probably tailoring. :p
---
Happy birthday!!
---
Thing is: I'm not a gamer, I'm 32 and I don't have much time for them, so I just play a bit of Civ6, some Dota and vanilla WoW on a pserver and that's really it. No point in getting a PC, really. But your point is absolutely valid, if you're a gamer than a PC is definitely a better choice.
---
Also...
---
Tuesday's gone
---
Rolling on  Cadaverous Armor and some Shoulders.
---
Are Truestrike Shoulders dropped by Pyroguard Emberseer in Phase 1? sorry rogues really need that Hit
---
Other than that I don't even plan to roll on  **Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge** and  **Dal'Rend's Tribal Guardian**, even tho it's in every Bis List for Hunter
---
World of Warcraft Europe: about 5 months
---
Beta: September 2004
---
Release date: February 11, 2005
---
World of Warcraft Europe Final Beta: 34 days
---
Beta: January 8, 2005
---
Technically, it was basically European server test of already-released game - something close to Classic.
---
PVP server. Dwarf for sure. Torn between priest and paladin. 
---
I think I probably read pretty much everything there is to consider when picking between the two classes, in fact I probably overdid the research bit, but I just can't decide which sounds more my style. Going for full on healing either way. I probably won't even be one of the people brave enough to experiment with ret or shadow.
---
Yeah well there’s no way they would let some people have an advantage over others like that. Can you imagine if they let people carry level 60s over on to a fresh realm? The whole game would be a giant mess.
---
* Added 100% experience potions to shop.
---
*Added level 60 boost to shop.
---
I had no live sub, but re-upped jic they are basing the beta keys on active subs.
---
April 17 was my bday. You're welcome boys
---
Not going to happen
---
I dont give a shit about beta just give us release date ffs
---
Play Heal Pala and you will not get one shot by anyone ;)
---
Looks like Ninja Costume. But, judging from the mount, he actually was able to interact with some Wind Rider Master.
---
"Warlock why didnt you soulstone the healer?"
---
It's cool bro I got cables.
---
This mage knows what's up
---
I am pretty sure because the game was technically released and developed in 2018 with the demo. So they have some time to get the 2019 rights
---
You're gonna be real dissapointed when you get hit with that exact same sequence of events in classic, happened all the time in the vanilla. Live and die by the rng
---
\- Create your characters/alts in advance and park them so they can soak up rested xp. You're gonna need it.
---
\- Go for tailoring on some character, you will need bags.
---
Other than that, don't rush it, you will have (And need) more time as you think anyways.

---
Mark of the dragon lord. Very op shammie ring from last boss in lbrs. I had everything I could get from raids and this was the completion to my bis list. Linking it to my guild sham bros was a good feeling
---
For pve you can ignore that number entirely.  In pvp the tradeoff is more interesting, im sure people have mathed it out to some exchange rate.
---
I mean, April 25th is the official first day of summer in Iceland, and it's already official summer in Canarias.
---
And yet, there is no word about the release date. So, the beta will compensate that just fine.
---
Jokes aside, people who play games/browse the web/don't do what they are paid for in general should be instafired
---
Can you elaborate how it works?
---
What do you mean by that?  
---
You were given compromised accounts???
---
You’re good, homey! See ya in the Barrens!
---
Are there eyes in this pic?
---
Didn't pay for it, still agree. Take my upvote.
---
Yes, exactly. And that could be from changing single typo in code to even adjusting whole method functionality for some spell.
---
thanks guys, I appreciate it
---
Two words: Gaming Laptop
---
On Horde Priest has a favorable least played/most needed ratio.
---
But honestly... we can't tell. Things might be different than back in the real vanilla days... and different than current private servers. Got a feeling that there will be many, many Warriors this time around and few more Warlocks as they will not start out as gimped class but straight out competitive with 1.12 patch.
---
Blizz usually uses more closed Beta phases, so they always wipe Beta characters. Not happening.
---
I tried out both, and didnt pick horde because their cities are trash. Orc architecture is just so bad looking lol
---
Meta role-playing!
---
nah...haha....his pally farts were bad enough!!!  he was a pally healer in the raid guild, and would run tank for me.....clearing instances for upgrades while I levelled.  :)
---
Sorry, post was removed because we don't allow image posts that don't relate to WoW besides the post's title.
---
You're mega retarded how could you even possibly think this, even for one second, that it would be the case that your beta character would just trnafser over? I'm actually astounded at thinking what kind of simpleton you are.
---
We actually had 1 Boomkin in our raid! Spell crit aura support xD
---
Night Elves man.. people love Night Elf hunters. It's the same thing with Undead warlocks.
---
I'm in the OR refreshing new as we speak.
---
&gt; guys, I appreciate it
---
Anyway you need some items with hit/spirit/mp5?
---
It really stands out, even Alliance side. Top quality mount. Best of luck.
---
People who played back then will be more likely to spot inaccuracies.
---
These previous tests are irrelevant. They were all new content.
---
A Classic WoW beta would be just to make sure the servers don't implode and game systems are functional.
---
*Gets invited to beta*
---
*Spends all of beta on the character creation screen*
---
I dont want to spoil the main stuff, so if i do play the beta it'll probably be as a nelf (will be rolling Dwarf on live), but honestly i just want to see a bit of the old world again, look at talents, spells, etc.
---
Im also going to have to get used to that UI again.  its been...what...8 1/2 or 9? years since they went away from it on retail iirc.
---
Any commit that triggers their build service basically!
---
Those column names...did they write WoW in Wordpress?
---
I wouldn’t recommend leveling as elemental, you’ll be drinking constantly 
---
Put 14 points into resto for hit chance and wider totem range
---
Dump the rest into enhance and keep a heal set in the bank
---
👍
---
This person above is incorrect. Hunters are extremely popular while raids only need 2-3 at the most. It's not easy finding a raidspot.
---
Can't quite see if he's playing a Paladin or not...
---
afaik betas usually dont require a sub.  I think i remember people getting BfA invites that werent subbed anymore.
---
bonus points if you're tanking
---
Just ask yourself, does it make sense to give only a certain amount of people a head start on fresh servers let alone a 1-2 month head start.
---
yeah i wish i did some healing in vanilla but i didnt start till bc
---
in any organise group i would hope people will try and stop their healer from being burst down. like the dps should be between the enemy and the healer.
---
if you get surprise cc'ed you can get out of it and use whatever you have available to try and make some distance while your team helps you.
---
some classes have easier times with this but priests had a pretty good vanilla kit im sure they had at least one good stun or something?
---
everyone dies faster so positioning and trying to keep greens between you as a healer and the reds was important
---
DH are melee, so Id say Rogue is close to what shes looking for. Or Enhance Shammy. Feral druids can keep from being rooted by shape shifting, but their hybrid nature makes them less potent in general and simpler rotation than DH.
---
Most importantly, will the beta character persist until live? If so, this is launch.
---
Can do a hybrid if you're really wanting resto talents but I'd go into enhancement and maybe go shield and dagger for a bit slower but way more consistancy with flametounge over wind fury down till level 32 then go resto. Level 32 gets you all 3 points into elemental weapons.
---
We've known this for two years already.
---
Not entirely true on this day and age 
---
4 horseman has meen proved to be doable/cheese
---
With 4 tanks
---
Look with your eleven eyes my friend. They put beta game files up on the launcher,
---
This is correct. Hunters have a very hard time finding groups. There is a lot of them and raids dont bring more than 2-3.
---
&gt;finding their first friends on the server.  
---
I hate to break your heart but we arent 12 anymore.  Itll be mostly the same cold lack of interaction that any modern mmo has.
---
It's a null sum game. Assuming that everyone leaves as soon as they're done, it's equally fast in a group vs. solo.
---
I vaguely remember a disc shadow priest healing in battlegrounds with my guild that would spec to make his instant casts cost less mana, just enough into shadow to get mind flay, and would kite dps with rank 1 mind flay after fearing them.
---
soon(tm)
---
I did, on my Shaman. I didn't play Warrior until Cata.
---
I mean, you don't even have to put 'copyright' on something to have a copyright of it. It's an odd ritual everyone keeps doing, I guess out of tradition.
---
That's because you fucking misdirected to the healer, huntard.
---
Makes sense.. After all, Horde needs to have their hands held more than Alliance. :P
---
 If there is to be a beta, are you willing to try and play it? 
---
The idea of a Beta is to provide feedback on any potential issues &amp; bugs, prior to them releasing the live game. It will be interesting to see how many glaring problems (or minor bugs) there are. I hope they get everything ironed-out before the game goes live.
---
But if the drops aren't shared, it doesn't matter because you're competing for the same drops whether in a group or not. Unless you get into a group that continues to help you when everyone else is already done, but that's besides the point.
---
Considerably easier these days though since the problem of 4HM is already known and guilds can start farming Reels from ZG right away.
---
Ehhhh more like [Scholomance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholomance)

IMO getting camp t and tb would be better than xr and ratchet. You’ll get more exp for discovering the zones. Plus you normally quest and grind on your way to xr and ratchet. But running to tb there’s nothing to grind on the walk after leaving camp t.

Why would it make any sense to only give a select amount of people a head start on fresh servers?
---
Hey guys look, people who want vanilla to be left alone and just vanilla are "elitists".
---
Once again, you can cover a larger area, and thus be able to tag more mobs as they spawn.
---
I remember when they used these to slowly tease their new game. The would put one up at a time on their website and there was so much hype, for the time, as to what it was going to be. Warcraft 4? New Diablo? New Starcraft? New IP?
---
As far as websites go, there is a big misunderstanding in copyright claims on the website. 
---
From [this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2390230/do-copyright-dates-need-to-be-updated):
---
&gt; If the claim is based on common law copyright (not formally registered), then the date should be the date of first publication.
---
Not sure if it translates to WoW, but I reckon there is no real harm in having it be 2018.
---
Did your vent audio legit sound like that or was it just the video?
---
Sure, if the employee does not complete their job functions. But it is easy to meet those functions and play WoW when it comes to some of these jobs.
---
Battlenet most likely, but not BFA. I wonder if they will be sharing some of the same files &amp; directories, for people that are playing both.
---
Can someone just put me in a coma until this launches? And then Wake me up an hour before launch with a week's worth of coffee and sandwiches ready?

Depending on stats, the armor type is just incidental.  There are classes of all armor types wearing a mix because of stat prefs.
---
If they let streamers in, I would hope the streamers would be in "bug hunt" mode. Get their viewers in on it as well; viewers a lot of times notice way more of what's going on than the actual streamer. Crowd source it!
---
You wont be bored on mage. They are the most well rounded vanilla class, strong af pvp, strong af lvling farming. Yah raiding you spam frostbolt, you also hit your trinkets/ CDs, sheeps, aoes, detect magic, decurses I mean they as fun as any class I guess.

That is pretty damn awesome, no lie.  Talk about having to think on your feet.
---
Issue is that the main dangers are Rogues and Warriors. Both have a get out of fear (2 if they are UD) and that then leaves you with half a minute of trying to survive them. Kiting isn't something that looks viable for a priest because Renew is useless and your instants are PW:S or Dwarf/Human Racial.
---
&gt; Kinda like "1 good upgrade an instance".   
---
Thats some really good advice right here. I remember when I did run dungeons in TBC it was the norm to not be greedy with gear and try to make sure everyone gets something as far as the drops allowed that. This kinda loses value once you go into the 50+ area of dungeons and the first pre raid BIS items drop. It would be unreasonable to expect someone to pass on that only because they got some borderline okayish stuff from another boss.
---
He’s a warrior I believe.
---
Colour pallet of skills + what looks like MS on ‘1’ 
---
Also appears to have empty bar beneath hp suggesting rage.
---
Also stances lol
---
I’m not fun at parties :(
---
You just gave me ptsd
---
So they have blackout, which if it procs is a godsend. Other than that their fear is either fear or MC neither of which are overly reliable (on first use)
---
Yes I'll play to about 20-25 just to get a feel for it.
---
Misdirect was introduced in Burning Crusade.
---
But the leveling bro :((((
---
Xrealm bgs are needed to avoid HOURS of queue time
---
no chance, it'd give too much of a head start.
---
Don't assume every player will use their cds timely. My experience has always been the majority of people don't know when to use their cooldowns, in vanilla all the way to bfa. 
---
Given all the time if your team hasn't intercepted the rogue or war then you need to stand ontop of your heal target. Also from experience most people you're healing get brain damage when they find out they have a pocket healer.
---
That's completely wrong, you will not need retail installed for classic.
---
\*lock
---
Like someone else mentioned here, the guy is merely a WoW fan who is excited for classic, just like most on this subreddit. He probably dreams of WoW and blue posts, and he has an audience who he appeals to. Perhaps they feel he expresses their own excitement, or that he augments/complements it. Anyway, whether 5 minutes, 14, an hour or more, while I don’t watch his content, there’s nothing absurd about their being people who do.
---
2 July is my bet
---
hey I had the same problem. I wanted to get an idea if I could play it on my Mac by downloading retail and seeing how that ran. I have a 2011 13" MacBook Pro (i7 version) which runs private servers pretty well. I tried to run it and ran into same problem: no Metal support.
---
What I found out is that if you install Windows via Bootcamp (tons of tutorials online) you can still run it! Also, Windows is free to install (you can run it without activating) with a few caveats such as watermarks. Retail runs like total shit on my MacBook without dedicated graphics but technically works. I think your machine would do quite well with it though.
---
I imagine if you do the same as I did then you can use your Mac to play. this is better than Linux/WINE because it would be natively running on the machine (no emulation overhead etc.).
---
The other solution I found was the 2012 MacBooks are still supported and are the same form factor, so it's possible to replace the 2011 motherboard with a 2012 motherboard and it should work. There were a few tutorials of this I found online but that was much more expensive and more work than Bootcamp. I would imagine that there is a similar process for iMacs from that era.
---
Good luck!
---
Copyrights last waaaaaaay longer than that
---
&gt; I thinks what she wants is more like gameplay wise. Like great mobility compared to other class and hit and run glass canon type of class.
---
Mage is the answer.
---
I'm talking about the mage going full iceblock
---
lol found the guy who doesn't work
---
Was this some kind of level 60 guild that existed during BC? There were no paladins for horde in vanilla.
---
Burn out ? Pfff
---
You merely adopted Dun Morogh, I was born in it, modeled by it. I didn't see Elwyn Forest until I was a grown gnome !
---
As a Pala your are able so leveling solo and when in a group with a Warrio you will be unstopable
---
Whoever gets in need to race through the content and find all bugs the sooner we find them all the sooner its released.
---
The general consensus is that it's better to level enhancement at the start until around level 40. After that you can go elemental until 60.
---
You get added benefits by registering a copyright and providing public notice of that copyright
---
Level as enhance.
---
arround level 55 you will gather you BiS items, so pick those for the resto build.
---
Level 60 you respec to Resto
---
It was also affected by your level vs mob level (capped at 5 levels above your level) and the total number of levels in your group.  If you're healing an instance close to the lowest level you can zone in, you make excellent xp, way better than grinding &amp; questing in the  world.
---
I dont know why. I just feel like you do because I have a hard time believing one wouldnt understand this.
---
I tried this, it didn't really work with BNET launcher.
---
It’s been 12 years
---
Probably how they do the old warcrafts, it's just an exe
---
If you focus on the aspect of BG's as a healer and get one-shotted by 2 or more dps then yes you will be most likely one-shotted as any healer, except Paladin for bubble. 
---
The best class for PvP is Paladin, of the fact that you got bubble, but also blessing of freedom and a stun. Whats also a savior for Paladin and why the best premade teams are Alliance if you look on other talents thats not obvious for everyone is blessing of sacrifice. 
---
Priest is huge PvP healers for the cc part with fear and great heals and PW:s. Mind Vision is big in BG's, especially WSG.
---
No way the beta characters carry over.  Sorry bud.
---
I'd say go pally not Druid. Druid is much harder than Pally. 
---
Also if she is doing dungeons Druid doesn't have a res. If she is playing at a low level people are going to die, and then have to run back.
---
PVP: from top to bottom.
---
Hunter
---
Warrior
---
Rogue
---
Shaman
---
Mage/warlock
---
Paladin
---
Not even in PS that happen.
---
I'm sorry you have to work with such an idiot.
---
However it is an indicator of people interested and that segment of people would be more effective Beta testers IMO
---
This page makes me so anxious because to check what your prefs are you go to a page where you also can change the prefs. And every time I navigate away I wonder if by some weird mis-click I accidentally un-checked it.
---
And then I just have to check it again . . . ugh. Send help please.
---
This is absolutely keeping me from rolling a druid.  I played one in vanilla for a while and it was so fun to level, and just brutal at 60. The damage was bad, if you were feral and wanted better damage then you'd be at very low mana and took away from being a real hybrid. 0/30/21 was OK, but not great. Feral ended up being good tanking for 5s, resto ended up being pretty OK for PvP where flag carrying was the specialty, but healing 5s was ass.  I never understood why paladins couldn't have a taunt and druids couldn't have a rez...as if this was some game-breaking thing.  Funny enough, I parked my druid for the rest of vanilla and he was my main in TBC. Druid in TBC was 1000000000000000000% better than vanilla. Vanilla was brutal on druids
---
it depends what your looking for. If you have a pre set group already, then you can instance your ways through the levels.  Go Farm instances 3-4 or 5 times in a row, get the quests (normally outside the instances too), and re-run them. Good money too, and good drops to vendor. 
---
Also, you can quest together and farm mobs faster.  Even shared XP would be fine as you can find grinding spots and all pull / kill clearing the area quickly. Also you can do higher level quests, like orange, red &amp; elite quests in groups.
---
Not only is EXP split among the party but quest drops and pickups are not instanced like in retail.
---
Hardest to easiest imo:
---
1. Hunter
---
2. Warlock
---
3. Mage
---
4. Rogue
---
5. Warrior
---
6. Shaman
---
7. Druid
---
8. Priest
---
9. Paladin
---
i always thought it was redridge mountains. There are some ruins there that kinda match - but there are no demons there.
---
The one that stands out to me the most was going from my little tree island (teldrassil) to the wild and the gloominess of darkshore for the first time on my NE hunter. Just got my lil cat friend, a brand spanking shiny new green bow and second bag, ready to take on the world. Loads of small moments like that.
---
I remember taking a day to figure out how to reach westfall to go to something called 'The deadmines' my friend told me about and the first time clearing that. Also stumbling upon Stormwind in the process, absolutely epic. Poking my head into STV to have a look at level 23, but not coming back until being super excited around level 29. Making the run from Ratchet to Gadgetzan to do Tanaris and Zul'Farrak, going down into Ungoro, and then back up out to Silithus (which may as well have been Mars to me it felt so far away from civilisation). Going through that door you needed the key for for the second half of BRD, that was epic, best dungeon ever made in any MMO imo. I could go on for hours and hours really, so many of these moments.
---
I think i'm focused on the aspect of BG's because that is where I hope to spend alot of my time - Especially after AQ40. 
---
Paladins are insanely strong in PvP but I don't want to belive that Priests and just shark food when it comes to BG's. There isn't even a huge amount of healer PoV content for Priest Heales :(
---
rogue mage warlock hunter druid shaman warrior priest paladin
---
I'd really disagree with the placement of warrior. Warrior PvP feels like it comes down to how good your support is. You simply lack the tools of every other class for as many skill plays.
---
As a French : \*slow clap\*
---
Which would be awesome if i wasn't leveling a duo with an "unknown class as of yet" haha! I just wish i could get my head around Druids.
---
Won't ever happen.
---
I didn’t misunderstand anything. 
---
You wholly contradicted yourself. 
---
Take care.
---
Despite what it seems not everyone on this sub has a burning hatred for modern wow.  Go have fun with it and classic will be different and fresh later.
---
How the fuck is that elitist? Do you even know what that word means? He's not trying to gatekeep you, he's just being realistic. No reasonable raid group is gonna let you join the raid if you view important, powerful consumables as anything BUT mandatory. They are literally fucking essential. I hate to say it, but the fact that you're calling him an "elitist" because of this is so indicative that vanilla probably won't be for you my dude.
---
If you honestly think that retail and classic have completely different audiences you have no idea what you’re talking about. 
---
If you played retail you’ll see people hyped for classic constantly. You can straight up just ask any stranger what they’re going to play in classic and they’ll actually give you a class. People that aren’t at least going to check it out are very very rare.
---
8.2 is doing a lot to fix the huge problems with bfa and releasing classic at the same time would be a very stupid thing to do. 
---
I’m getting sick of people saying they have completely different audiences because that belief isn’t based in reality lol.
---
They were tricked by the Legion and Gul'dan's betrayal. It was the Legion killing and invading with new Corrupted Orc soldiers, the Orcs did not decide to start murdering and invading one day out of the blue. They were peaceful tribal people for the most part. They were not committing any genocides.
---
Later, the Orcs (all, Fel and uncorrupted) were attempting to retreat from the Alliance, who were actually going to commit genocide and kill all the Orcs, even the uncorrupted ones, and Ner'Zhul tried opening portals to other worlds to help them escape, but it backfired. It was really due to the Legion and the Alliance, not the Orcs themselves. The Orcs were caught in the middle.
---
You can't even begin to pretend that Gul'Dan and Thrall are the same morally or ideologically.
---
Hope you are getting WoD story mixed up with the actual history of Draenor. That was time travel, alternate timeline stuff.
---
&gt;Hunter horde
---
Why is this? Only one in the list to stick out for me.
---
From a business perspective, the best thing for them to do is release them just over a month apart.
---
That way they get 2 months of sub from everyone who wants to try both 8.2 and Classic.
---
Some of them would be, sure. Most of them would not be. Most people only want to get into a beta to play the game and will never report a single bug.
---
I too plan to be a resto shammy end game. 
---
My leveling plan: Enhancement until 40, keeping some int gear on hand if I want to heal a dungeon.  Respec to Ele at 40, heal dungeons in that gear.  Respec to Resto at 60, maybe a few levels earlier if I just want to grind dungeons.
---
bad idea, cartman already tried that with nintendo wii launch :D
---
The point of the project is to preserve 1.12, though. Adding a whole ton of effectively new content goes against that.
---
I'm logically 100% with you
---
But nostalgically, I still DISTINCTLY remember getting into the WoW beta as a 13 year old and the tremendous hype I experienced creating my Tauren hunter and levelling him to 7. I just gotta do it again. Almost zero chance I play past level 10 in a beta, but I still desperately want to do it!
---
Yeah we did it! It relesead yesterday yey!
---
That is every Beta. 
---
I have been in the last 4 and I can tell you most players I talked to use the hell out of the bug reports.
---
I've never managed a guild so forgive the noob quesiton, but why not have a DKP backup plan instead of sharding an item? Maybe let OS roll on the item or something?? Sharding it seems extreme, although I understand why...just why can't there be an alternative?  I don't trust loot councils because it's FACT that people are biased, but I get the reasons. Seems like there's a gray area here. Am I wrong? Why?
---
Forgot classic already? It happened at first launch.
---
Priest is very strong, but when jumped you need peels and/or assist heals.
---
In pugs it's very easy to fake heal and survive, but premade it's much harder, although in premade you should get assisted.
---
The fuck you think people on THIS sub are gonna say?  I hate threads like this, just lookin for attention.
---
every DPS is fine so i would not worry
---
Sure, but those are people that Blizzard picked, not ones that paid to get it because they just want to play the game.
---
EU too?
---
Ok but no
---
I'm not well versed with WoW betas, is it likely to test all content we would need to level from 1-60 or can we create high level characters to test that content right away?
---
The youtuber is called NekRage and the video you are thinking off is https://youtu.be/Z7pPakXxnIQ
---
I remember locks protesting the state of the class by repeatedly bombing auction houses this way.
---
Level 19 twinking man
---
There's going to be nightmare combos for anyone, vanilla is rock paper scissors. A paladin mitigates a lot of your concerns with rogue\war combos, but save for bubble mage\mage, mage\war, lots of other combos are gonna equally rock a paladin healer.
---
Rather than convince you that you'll beat everyone if you try enough, I'd offer this perspective, as a potential priest OR paladin:
---
BGs aren't 100% like arena. Dying is far, far, FAR less of a concern in WSG or AB. Even in a worst case scenario where you get 1\2 shot by rogue\warrior, in theory that gives your arms warrior that you're healbotting an equal amount of free time to gib the rogue, and then face a 1v1 with the warrior. Defending an AB flag? This is a "win". Assaulting an AB flag? This is probably a loss. 
---
Point is, though, it's not just about dying. Situational play is really important. If you wanna die less and feel amazing, paladin probably calms a lot of your fears and is dare I say "better", but as a priest you provide an amazing amount of utility and can still contribute.
---
Specifically for priest there's also specs like the tri-spec where you can get additional utility like blackout\silence. There's just so many trade offs in vanilla, that's the beauty of it in my opinion.
---
?? Watch some steezy he always plays disc or mage, wsg premades on henhouse
---
I can concede that point.
---
Imagine getting this vindictive over something so small.
---
Nostalrius is not censored here, only all the other ones.
---
the perfect revenge, beautiful!
---
Ho yeah right I forgot the initial use of druid in WSG. Now that you are talking about yeah.
---
I'd like to try out different classes at 60 if you can make max level classes, if not I'm not levelling a character who will get deleted
---
No zeppelin between Thunderbluff and Orgrimmar. Just the regular flight points. So gotta hoof it to Orgrimmar.
---
if its BG healing, and its pugs, there is very little you can do. You can tell folk you are a healer and will do all you can to keep them topped up, but they need to help you if you are being ganked.   Main point is make yourself tough to hit....back to the wall, so rogues cant get the jump on you. Not in line of sight for hunters.  If you are healing the flag carrier in WSG or tanks in AV, then back to walls at all times. But in general, out in the open, clothies are easy to jump on and you have to spam your heals to save yourself. Always try to see who's coming and move to keep your DPS between you and them.
---
Not sure on the down votes, Just trying to help everyone out since we will all have to buy game time may as well get a discount lol.
---
This is pretty true. If you want to survive without having to depend on a shit ton of help and viper sting cleanses from someone else, play a paladin and avoid a priest at all costs. Priest was AWESOME for PvE healing but probably THE WORST at PvP healing. Their dispells were fucking GREAT though, but you will get trained hard or constantly polyed with no way to get out (unlike blessing of sacrifice).
---
Low level rested XP is rather worthless. Given how fast you get the lower levels, the rested bonus \*might\* save you 5 minutes.
---
But I want to help the otters crush the skulls on their enemies on their bellies.
---
Well, in every guild I’ve ever been in, if you loot the item, you pay DKP.  This leads to fervent competition for BIS items and sharding of decent upgrades.
---
My guild is going to use a Loot Ladder system where eligible classes take turns getting loot.  If it’s your turn, congrats! Then you move to the bottom of the ladder.
---
Hi, /u/JHoneyBadgerS
---
It's really happening!!
---
&gt;  The school enrolled about ten students to become the [*Solomonari*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonari). 
---
hmm...

---
I know, I know. Depends on who reads my comment on who is going to tell me how I'm wrong and which class is the actual best WPVP class. Last time it was Druid, which are apparently all unstoppable killing machines that no one can defeat according to the other thread.
---
Nope, we kew they were using 7.x client, not a 8.x one
---
Swap stance &amp; weapon is a big thing.
---
DL boot camp and just run windows on a partition
---
IMO, leveling a shaman is much, much worse than leveling a paladin.  Everyone says it's bad, and I guess it's not a ton of stuff you do so it can get mundane, but priest was: bubble, blast, dot, wand, wand, wand, wand.....wand...wand, repeat. Pally isn't THAT bad.
---
Biomed here. Don't break anything - we busy F5n'
---
&gt; actually good hunters
---
What makes someone an 'actually good' hunter?
---
Spend all my money on BoE's that will sell for several times more in three months. Prolonging my mount until late 40s-50. As a shaman, its no big deal to me.
---
1 yes. The main raids are almost all 40 mans, later on there are a couple 20 mans. Technically, there are some lvl 60 dungeons you need 10/15 man raid parties for
---
2. No looking for raid/grp tool. You have to look in chat/guild and put your grps together. Also have to run to your dungeons (unless you have a warlock who can summon!)
---
Psh - a well geared and well played druid can be an absolute beast in almost any situation.  I’m strongly considering maining druid in classic, only problem is I’d be broke from respecs.
---
Sure, but you use the original date of copyright. You don't update the year only when you add to the copyright, that's just silly nonsense.
---
Enhancement without a doubt. Don't even think about it. Follow this pic for any class to level and then respec at 60. Shaman at 60, you should strongly consider 30/0/21
---
[https://imgur.com/a/aNm8V#5](https://imgur.com/a/aNm8V#5)
---
Will people level all the way to 60 in the beta? Or can you manually adjust your level to do different content?
---
I have never been involved in a beta
---
Just taking those numbers at face value, the average is 131 days. Things could be different for this beta a bit since it's doing something novel in reviving a lot of old content data and porting it all into a very different client and server code base. But, taking history as a guide, and assuming that the beta starts within three weeks, that suggests a launch in mid-September. I guess you can still sort of call that "summer," depending where you live.
---
Considering this doesn't require development of any "new" content, maybe the test could be shorter. But considering that the team is doing something they've never done before by porting "old" content into a new codebase that it never designed for, while also attempting to conform the behavior of the "new" client + "old" content to some semblance of how the game behaved more than a decade ago, in a time that is somewhat obscured now by distance and hazy memories, there may be more unanticipated issues to work out than we assume.
---
Is this official?
---
I know this is how it used to work, I'm wondering if this is staying the same.
---
So how do you deal with the murlocks?
---
I believe hearthstone keep their cards because they were purchased with real money. If they weren’t allowed to keep the cards they got packs instead for the money already spent.
---
Go feral druid for the most mobility in Vanilla. Putting 2/2 into Feline Swiftness will give you a 30% speed boost when in cat form, so your baseline movement rate will be faster than the other classes.
---
Man these are great. First one looks like perhaps the inspiration they drew on for Desolace? Can't really think of any other zones that use this color scheme / aesthetic. The third one, with the three Horde guys, was definitely my background for a long time. 
---
Hell, I'd love to use these again now, but for whatever reason Windows insists on using the same background across all of my computers... including my work computer, which I regularly give presentations with etc., and don't really want to have to explain my video game fixation to most of my clients..
---
Thank you, Just added 60$ to my blizz account for $40. It wont show the final $40 cost until you check out all the way.
---
On a PvP server, it's worth while to quest with a group. Other groups will ignore you, and if you're solo then you're an easy target for other groups. This WILL happen.
---
If it’s vanillalike it won’t be any worldchat.
---
They'll launch them 1 to 3 months apart, so they can chash in some resubs
---
I'm going to finally make use of my hour long lunch break that I haven't needed in years.
---
I know for regular items its shared, but what about quest items? If you're in party do we have one zhevra hoof each?
---
&gt; F2P
---
Yea, the cash shop isnt thought to have been the beginning of the end for WoW. Which is how those games make money.
---
&gt; cost of server
---
Blizzard has other overheads though. Like I can sysadmin a single WoW server as a hobby, for free. You want me to admin a whole set of them, for a full time job? Along with several other people because I cant be awake 24/7? And we need to ensure a very high uptime? What about refunds when the servers have downtime? You think a pserver is going to refund your donation, lol
---
Sure, there are people who are ALWAYS going to be there ready to gank, but I feel like the risk/reward payoff is much higher in PvP.  Like Hardcore characters in Diablo.
---
This sub is the worst about downvotes. Very weird. (I think its all the EU here, not joking)
---
Wow. The fact that in 2001, a company like Blizzard wasn't even bothering to provide a 1980x1080 resolution for wallpapers is so shocking to me! I mean I definitely remember what all those old monitors looked like, just easy to forget sometimes how far we've come with technology in the last 20 years...
---
Sure. You are considered a copyright holder when you create something. On almost everything, you'd place the year of the original copyright. If you update the product, you don't have to update the copyright year, because it's already protected by copyright. People update the year because it's expected by society for some reason, and it helps make things look recent/up-to-date/fresh.
---
No matter what, however, you still own the copyright from when the thing was first made. They *should* put 2003 or 2004, but they update it each year because that's what people expect, even though it's not required.
---
Do you know any GMs that are still GMs to this day?
---
Yeah no problem! I had to check out all the way and it updated on paypal a couple minutes later.
---
"I don't understand why I'm getting downvoted? Also, fuck that region in particular!"
---
Because EU only visits r/classicwow and isn't present on any other subreddit huh.
---
Shadow is worth experiencing and spending some gold on switching back and forth once in a while to enjoy a PvP weekend absolutely melting people. Trust me, do it at least a few times because the rest of the time as a priest you will end up polymorphed, viper stinged, counterspelled, big red cat zerged, fel puppy focused, and train wrecked hard in any BG other than AV.
---
Does anyone have any guide as to how to download the client?
---
Tried blizzget, but it seems to require some modifications towards the cdns url, which I don't know how to do. CASCExplorer downloads some files but starting the WoWB.exe does nothing... :/
---
here is hoping they do it by account age. keep all the raider.io reliant kiddies in retail!
---
which are easy macros to setup, the outplay ability is pretty low compared to hunters locks and rogues.
---
IIRC It's against the ToS, and if you're caught doing it, you'll be warned or punished.
---
It's official.
---
15 years ago.
---
totally. I 100% agree with you... thats my plan too... take over a meeting room for lunch and play away...hahaha
---
less than 0% chance. maybe -999,999,999% chance in fact. lol
---
Always turn these kind of questions around. Would you like it if a Warrior took your mail piece? The nice thing would be to pass but all is fair in war and pre raid BIS farming.
---
Yes, it's official. Classic will be classic. The raids will be 40, there will not be lfd or lfr.
---
Ya I remember at the end of vanilla there were regular pug groups going every week. Probably from 10 or so guilds then whatever it took to fill the raid from ironforge spam. I went on a few of them on my Alts. Cleared it just as well as any guild that had it on farm.
---
People are better at the game now
---
madman
---
As a warrior, it definitely is a good “impression” of how warriors played on live, but I definitely understand why the pserver crowd thinks warriors are gimped.
---
It also doesn’t help that frost bolt’s hit WAY harder on the pservers ‘then they ever did on live and there are therefore like twice as many frost mages.
---
Levelling unarmed as a warlock was a pita
---
You are all just mad us hunters don't have those beefy repair bills and we are better at farming then u is. Hunters in my guild whined loud and hard enough that getting us purposefully killed would get you raid kicked for the night. It was always the rogues. God I hate rogues.
---
The people I have an issue with the most are the EU redditors who hand out here on a US site.   
---
Very different worldviews/values. Very salty people.
---
Because Fallout 76
---
Yeah, things like assassin's blade may be worth blowing money on, then grind lvls 37-40 to get money for your mount instead of saving like normal. Long-term ROI on buying twink blues when everyone's poor and selling in 9 months should be rediculous.
---
Gonna feed my altoholic addiction.
---
First, attempt to grab a male undead warlock with the name "Richard". If successful, level him. If not successful, then role a full set of Alliance characters, being Male Night Elf Druid, Female Night Elf Hunter. Male Dwarf Rogue. Female Dwarf Priest. Male Gnome Mage. Female Gnome Warlock. Male Human Warrior. Female Human Paladin. Still undecided as to PvP or PvE servers. PvP is more realistic, but I hate being ganked and see no point in ganking.
---
just because you call something summer does not make it true.  Summer is the time between the summer solstice and the fall equinox.  In the northern hemisphere the summer solstice is June 21.  That is when summer begins.
---
nah a guy usto make like really long videos with like music talking about zones and areas i think a lot of them were just music and text because he was not english
---
need to find the videos some time
---
And when the invite comes: https://youtu.be/WhISJkK42vM
---
You'd probably have to get those alts to lvl 10+ for that rested xp to be meaningful. Being rested for 40 bars of XP isn't very impactful on a level 1.
---
Druid, so you can heal them or run away from PvP, your choice.
---
I haven't noticed anything off with sound, when comparing my 1.12.1 client connected to a private server in the background, and blizzcon demo.
---
What I have noticed, is that the 1.12.1 one looked more... archaic. You know, old, worn and dusty. A different vibe. The portal had a bit different, more reddish colors on the portal, and looked more post-apocalyptic. But, I had no idea what is causing the "new" vibe. Like comparing a game running on low and high. even though I couldn't find any difference in details.
---
Then I entered the character selection screen, and it was clear. It's the WOW logo itself! Not just the "CLASSIC" text, but they used the post-TBC recolor of vanilla logo!
---
And, it's that way, recolored, on the BlizzCon 2017 trailer too! I really hope they change it.
---
depends where I am fishing I guess haha.
---
Thank you! What are warlock recommended professions?
---
Wealth can have a snowball effect, though.
---
Exploits will likely be fixed, including this one. Cross faction communication is against the TOS just like getting the flag in WSG out of the map would be against the TOS. Any old methods for exploiting the system to circumvent the rules will be fixed even if they worked during vanilla, and rightly so.
---
Thunderbrew’s Boot Flask quest. It brought you all over the world and it was my first time seeing Tanaris and Feralas. It was magic.
---
Why would you want to be around 100 other people trying to do the same quest as you?
---
Druids 1stt and Hunters 2nd.
---
Both PvE and PvP
---
[Drowning off the coast of Dun Morogh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVjjLozBC2g) and rezing in the starting zone GY can save you a shitload of time running. Dying and using spirit healer rez as a free hearth / TP pre-level 10 (when there's no rez sickness yet) is a great hack to speed up your leveling in general.
---
everything is relative.  If you can only sell a wand for a couple of silver, that means you can buy other player delivered goods/services for cheap as well.  
---
Sure it's not helping with your mount as vendor prices aren't tied to the server economy, but the money will still help.
---
I wish more people understood what this meant. If a company is making software on some kind of release cycle that is say 6-8 weeks, the marketing/deploy/release strategy is not always ready to go as soon as that time is up. I mean ideally it would be and you could always release right away but it just doesn't always happen like that, sales and marketing want to time stuff, etc. It might be a few cycles behind. So the "brand new" patch that just dropped for you today is very possible that nobody has touched the code for it for 2-4 months, plus they have also already finished the next patch you will get a couple months after that, and they are currently working on the one after that next one.
---
Yeah you're right. I'm thinking the beta will last two weeks maximum
---
that sounds like a great plan. I'll prob do likewise.
---
Copyright in a big work like wow would extend to lots of different discrete elements. If I had to guess I would say that they registered copyright for new IP that wasn't in the original client
---
Out of curiosity, why do you place Warlock this high? Not saying I disagree, because my vanilla PVP experience is a) only to rank 11 and b) a very long time ago, but I always felt Warlocks were pretty easy to play compared to rogue / hunter / mage.
---
I don't care much for PvP, I usually ignored enemy players if they ignore me. Though I still like playing on pvp servers because it just feels like more people play on pvp servers.
---
really? when did this change?
---
hunters get 1/3% crit and 20 ap from 20 agi while warriors and shamans get 1% crit so it's likely more valuable to warriors and shamans.
---
Is it rude for shamans and hunters to roll on leather gear? Bro warriors are gonna be rolling on your leather gear lmao. If it's bis it's bis
---
Did you get to choose your GM 'character' name?
---
I don't play Retail.
---
#NO CHANGES YOU DOPEHEAD. ^/s
---
&gt; , it's just funny how people think that classic is harder, 
---
Dude, I have literally tried to come back to retail wow 3 times since I left in Wraft and leveling super faceroll easy compared to how it used to be. You cannot deny that.
---
Speaking of those macros: does anyone have those for classic by chance? I am asking for a friend...
---
I mean, even the developer said it was meant to be an easy class.
---
I see, not sure what I was thinking before. Thought you were saying I thought that because PServer or something. 
---
But yeah. So many people in this sub talking out their ass about the game when they are referring to how it works on a PServer. They think they know everything about it, but it's going to be different enough to have a learning curve. If anything, the people who have been on Pservers with all the bugs are going to be behind, trying to make things work on classic like they do on the Pserver.
---
I 100% remember solo warriors, with enough gear, being a big threat in PVP of all kinds, especially as a healer. These guys are overwriting their actual Vanilla memories with Pserver bugs.
---
Don't ever doubt people's talent to be crappy
---
Funny thing there was a post some hours ago but got deleted by the mods
---
Duo leveling is completely viable and depending on the class optimal. Some classes synergise well like warrior priest, while hunter probably levels faster by its self. Ive heard that grinding mobs is faster than exclusively questing but that a combination of both can be the best if you really know what your doing. Take all this with a grain of salt and focus on what you and your friend find most fun cuz thats what youl remember, not how fast you leveled or how well you min maxed.
---
Don't forget there was an actual WoW board game with xpacs and everything. I really wish I knew enough people IRL that would be interested. Might go to my local geek shop and scope some players out...
---

---
If I remember correctly there is a penalty because xp is split evenly (assuming all members are same level) but you get "Party bonus" for grouping, which goes up as more people join the party.
---
This does not matter one bit as with good friends everything is fun, even watching paint dry. My best experiences (and worst!) came from grouping up with ransoms for quests and dungeons. Social aspect trumps xp penalty any day,. In my opinion, besides, tackling quests with a party is a walk in the park. Consider getting your friends to spec into dungeon/party spec, such as protection for warriors, restoration for druids etc. 
---
Normally leveling solo as tank or healer is slower than as dps spec, but dungeon/group play is harder (healing as shadow priest past lvl 40ish is a real chore as the heals cost a ton of mana, making you drink after every pull and slowing down the dungeon clear significantly).
---
By staying as group and doing quests together with a prot warrior, holy priest and 3 dps you can pul entire mob armies, as normal, non-elite mobs do not do enough damage to make the tank-healer combo break a sweat, so your entire party can get that 15/15 mobs killed ion one pull.
---
The architecture screams Lordaeron. It's very similar to cathedrals and churches in WC3.
---
Druid is really fun in world pvp though. You can get away from anything, and the skill cap is REALLLLY high for things you can do.
---
Show her one of the [Finalflash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvb8MwvsD4) videos or a [Stormx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQwH0atQZ0Q) video to see what is possible at the HIGHEST tier. And here is a good video showing some [INSANE dueling rogue vs mage](https://youtu.be/NENsoOaM7xc?t=741) (the other two classes in question). There is some god tier prediction on the rogues part (pretty much only way he's keeping it a fair fight), and both are using engineering to the max. The rogue can only close the gap and really compete with engineering trinkets and rocket helm, even with insane plays. 
---
It just showcases the mobility of each class at the highest tier, rogue has anti mage talents and is still just locked down the whole time.
---
NOCHANGES
---
Macros worked differently in vanilla than they do in the current retail, so not sure which ones will work in classic. Once the game comes out though you will be able to find them easily online.
---
I always played PVE on retail and didn't know what I was missing until I tried PVP privates. Yes, there's definitely a factor of annoyance. But being on a F R E S H server where I can get to 60 quickly and have a main to switch to when I level alts will feel really good. 
---
Keeping Redridge safe, always.
---
Err, pretty sure 20 agi is 40 ap for hunters.
---
Reddit isn't a US site, it's an international site.  It's just a large population here is from the US.
---
Yeah I pay for 40 accounts actually lol
---
You are getting downvoted because if you have been following this subject even lightly you would already know that even posing this question is kindof absurd. Blizzard's stated intention from the get go is to recreate the most authentic vanilla experience they possibly can. 
---
This obviously means there will be no changes to things like raid size or the non-existence of group finder.
---
Many in the past have said there is no such thing as a stupid question. I can't think of a stupider statement. If you are completely clueless on a topic like this the best way for you to get answers is not to make reddit threads asking stupid questions. The answer is to go read the blue posts, read the dev watercoolers, and consume content from people talking about classic wow to inform yourself.
---
You have rogue as #3 and druid as #6?
---
As a rogue main in vanilla, I think you have these backwards. Rogues really aren't that hard, it just might seem like that because the skill floor is so low
---
Harder than warrior, but not less than druids who have many more decision-making possibilities
---
Expires on April 26?
---
My take on this is that it kind of takes away a key aspect of the game: worrying about getting ganked and how to defend yourself, etc. I feel like on a PVE server that sense of "urgency" would be lacking, although full transparency, I haven't ever played on a PVE server.
---
r/news is US news...     
---
Anyway, my point still stands. EU know it alls, elitists, and overall hard to get along with redditors. Very sad.
---
human not go home. human like horde. human stay with green man and fuzz bull.
---
It's funny because I'm actually an x-ray dude (no doctor tho, because they dont make the exams at all) and friends have been sending me this Pictures for a while now. :D and on my nightshifts I'm doing exactly that (while waiting for Something to do, fast Internet at Work haha)
---
First aid is def nice because for a lock it kind of acts as an evocation with life tap when you need it, but honestly as a lock I never felt like I have needed it much while leveling because you basically double dip from food/water and your downtime is already very low.
---
Silk was the only time I found myself having any trouble keeping it up to speed with both, but a lot of mobs that drop silk are good for grinding anyway, so I just focused on them more for that reason. You’re also a lock, so if you’re seeing good prices on silk (since jt’ll be a fresh server) you have more wiggle room then other classes to grab it since you don’t have to buy your mount.
---
&gt;if you have been following this subject even lightly you would already know
---
Yeah well obviously he hasn't been following Classic WoW at all.
---
Don't be toxic and drive people away from the community. Let them ask questions.
---
cancel the trip they just released the beta
---
What l’m doing while I wait for classic? F5 this subreddit as hard as possible!
---
I, without a doubt have been to almost every *secret* location during vanilla wow. 
---
Of course there are the basics like underneath the capitols, or below Karazhan. Some advanced stuff like flightpath locations, GM Island. And then the really crazy stuff like Developers Island that needed quite a lot of trickery to get to. I wouldn't call it hacks tho. More like exploiting loose game mechanics. ;-)
---
Make sure one of you is healer and one is a tank and you’re set. Make sure to do each dungeon a few times at least. If possibly try and work your group so that you and your friends end up with priority over loot (eg if you have a friend who is a caster dps who wants loot from a dungeon, find 2 melee dps)
---
Fish where murlocks aren't
---
Lack of mobility, fear is the most commonly removable control via pvp trinkets, wide variety of utility spells that you can use, pet micromanagement, locks have a lot going on. As far as their specs, they can do it all, but not at the same time. Soul Link gives you survivability, but you struggle to kill people. Deep destro gives insane burst, but your baseline lack of defensive skills is made worse by not having improved survivability.
---
Compare this to mage who has both blink and nova on a shortish cool down, and blink and nova are able to get you away from any number of enemies. The best a lock can do is death coil which is on a much longer cool down and only hits a single target.
---
I'm on the train!! /s
---
Tough crowd
---
Agi only gave 1 ap in vanilla for Rogue/Hunter
---
You know, you're kinda shooting yourself in the foot, calling an entire region "hard to get along with" while being nationalistic and claiming that the site belongs to your country. The irony.
---
Well it was meant for people who killed THE final boss of the game
---
I thought the tower in northern dark shore
---
I think its something that is going to be become more talked about 2-3 years from now.
---
Does classic remain pristine forever, do they roll out further expansions, do they make new specific changes to classic etc.
---
I Wouldn't be opposed to something like the OSRS community vote platform for certain changes. (Unreleased planned vanilla content at the start of that list)
---
Well, if we want the game to be optimized to the best possible version we really want as many people as possible giving constructive criticism. If a large number of beta players bring up a major issue, it is more than likely to be fixed. That’s the point of a beta test in the first place 🤗
---
Survival stats for PvP is more along the line of "Do you feel as if you need more stam/armor?"
---
As far as I remember this changed during vanilla, so that wouldn't really be a NoChanges issue.
---
That being said I can't imagine it was ever that serious a TOS issue, can't exactly see the harm with "n o k i l l" or ":(", I did it all the time and never thought of it as a bannable offense.
---
Couldn't you just log out?
---
Live to win !
---
If only... XD
---
I think you're thinking of Hayven Games?
---
Real good content that was.
---
DM is Deadmines.
---
DM:E, DM:N, DM:Tribute etc, is Dire Maul.

Van Cleefe is a boss not a dungeon.

Getting corpse camped has nothing on losing at monopoly
---
Redridge is never safe.
---
dude.. the average skill level is much higher, they will use their cd's decently lmao
---
this sounds perfect. I'm based in Scotland.
---
His question was answered already and I was giving him a hint as to why people are reacting to him negatively. I also gave him a better method for informing himself on classic topics that are going to be be much better than making reddit threads.
---
I did the opposite of drive him away, I pointed him in the right direction. What are you even talking about?
---
Im not even kidding this is EXACTLY what I do, I just have my student do all the work
---
Thank you for your insights. Very helpful. So basically a Warlock's skill is less flashy but demands more micromanagement? Especially the pet factor makes for a good point.
---
huh? as a german i say thank you, i guess. i just read here and gather information about the game. stop that black and white thining pls 😅
---
I'm older now too, and have less time to waste getting ganked when I'm just trying to quest. Yes, pvp servers can be frustrating. But to me, the danger that pvp servers bring is fundamental to the experience of World of Warcraft. I tried playing on a pve server once back in the day but it was mind numbingly dull feeling safe everywhere I went. The world just feels alive on a pvp server. I'll never roll pve again.
---
Tranq shot and pulling with increased range, you only need like 1-2 hunters in the raid though. I wouldn't say they are in demand though there are more than enough hunters to fill 1-2 slots.
---
Hes fighting the undead warlock's minion
---
Hmm... you just reminded me of what they said.
---
&gt;We'll do their best to keep Classic and Retail separate
---
maybe that relates to population too?
---
finally a progress towards the release !!!!
---
yeah shit he died?
---
man i made a new yt account a while back and forgot to sub
---
sad he wont get to see classic
---
Good tier 1, so so tier 2 and shit onwards, they get worse as the game progresses
---
To me World PVP is what made Classic such a memorable experience, the rivalries it brought made this more than a game.
---
Some people are at work in a closed office during hours where they are expected to only act if an alarm goes off. During the night for example things can be very slow.
---
If you do night shifts in the psychiatry field its not weird to watch a movie or something when you are only guarding the department during the night for example.
---
Druid needs to be much higher on that list. Changing between four different forms each with unique abilities while trying to conserve mana and outlast your opponent, all while healing allies if you can. Druid skill cap is quite high.
---
Oo get a macro to switch between shield/1h and your 2h. Surprise 3k!
---
I guess even paypal staff are hyped for Endgame.
---
I enjoyed this and upvoted you. Alas my vote was drowned out by the masses.
---
I’m the complete opposite. I only ever played a PVE server. I always regretted it, as I loved pvp and it was my main enjoyment in tbc (didn’t get to endgame until tbc launched) 
---
Decided I will switch faction, and roll on a pvp server this time round.
---
However I do have my doubts and can imagine it being very frustrating at times. On the plus side I’ve played dark souls 3 for the last 3 years so I’m used to being punished and pvp being 90% unfair. 
---
The idea of level 60s ganking and corpse camping low levels sounds annoying if you have a job/family/life.
---
I think I will stick to my decision though, and I suggest you do as well. It makes sense to do whatever you can to make the game feel fresh.
---
I agree but I also think the singular focus has a negative effect on your experience. Making money your way is always better than just mindless grinding for cash to try and be ahead of the curve
---
I didn't realise you needed to tame more pets for higher rank attacks until well into the 40's
---
I believe /s is unnecessary when it is completely over the top. And it's fun when you get comments where people don't realize it's sarcasm.
---
:D
---
Don't do it, you'll miss the entire beta by the time the game is done.
---
Niceeee dude perfect plan to do before spending months inside staring at some lights lol
---
That will 100% be worth it but try not to think about it too much. Sounds like 2 months of torture lol
---
They should add these but charge $100K each.
---
Partially joking but I'd be curious to who would buy them and it would support development.
---
Medical student returning to fight for the horde. No I don't play healer. I'm just hoping to hit 60 before phase 2.
---
Goons confirmed
---
Depends honestly.
---
I remember having a set premade group when it was time to go through all the Scarlet Monastery dungeons. We just ran armory over and over and it seemed by far faster than anything else. Especially on a pvp server as we didn't have to deal with ganking.
---
Leveling entirely through dungeons is not worth it though, even if you have a premade group at all times.
---
Happy 54th Birthday, my dude!
---
hunters get 2 ranged ap per agi
---
I just checked, it's 2 ap.
---
https://imgur.com/a/cy6YP9m
---
(Because I assume we are talking about ranged AP with hunter because why wouldn't we?)
---
Not true. Hunter got 2 ap rogue 1
---
It's a bit of a mix.
---
Usually they start with level through everything, and towards the mid/end they do raid testing where they give you max characters to test the raid content.
---
It takes my mind off the wait. Plus it's all for a good cause and I'll see a ton of a beautiful country. But yes, it's not without its tortorous moments/days.
---
Calm down NoChanges, no one is saying do this day one, or even on the Classic Servers that are releasing this year.
---
North shire abbey
---
Hi, /u/SubmersibleGoat
---
Excellent thank you
---
If I'm a cat, eh, you're competition, but that's life.
---
On the other hand, if you take my bear-tank gear -when I'm tanking-, I'm going to be a bit on the cranky side with your existence.  No offense.
---
Limited invulnerability potions, gnomish net + free action potion, grenades / rocket helm into a mind control, fear, mind flay + swiftness pot kiting, fear + linkens boomerang and pray for a disarm, and the absolute secret way of dealing with melees is using double freezing band on a healer.
---
Priests do have some options, but they require engineering and some knowledge of the pvp scene on private servers.
---
Yeah politics is pretty much a non starter for a meme template in a classic wow sub.
---
yes, leveling is easier, in retail the focus is on endgame, everything else is easier, but the actual content that blizz keeps developing is miles ahead of vanilla in terms of difficulty
---
I mean, unlike most people asking this question, you've experienced a PvP server. If you truly didn't like that experience, sure go PvE.
---
I just think PvP is generally a more complete way to experience the game, so I'll always recommend it for people who haven't tried it.
---
The leveling XP requirements complaints will be all over the 10-20 zones early on before people start giving up or sucking it up.
---
This sentence itself shows the issue:
---
- you call the eu elitist, know it all but you already decided the fate of all the Europeans by classifying all of us (and we are quite a few)  in know it alls, elitists...
---
- you’re saying “hard to get along with redditors”. You’re excluding Europeans from being redditors. A bit harsh...
---
Finally, we have knees from the US in every media because the US have a clear impact on the rest of the world. It does not make reddit a “US only” site... I hope!
---
Wow thank you for those video, I 'm surely going to show her this ! Maybe she will be interested yeah ! And she love WPvP, infact PvP in general and she always strive to be better at the game (competively and mechanicaly speaking). So high skill ceiling class will interest her surely :)
---
&gt; It wont show the final $40 cost until you check out all the way.
---
I did $70 for $50. Everything showed $70, even initial paypal pending statement. Didn't update and show the $50 until like 5 min later when I got the email receipt.
---
it depends what you are looking for. Hunter and warrior questing together will tear it up. easy mob kills, easy grinding, you can tag mobs and bring them to the warrior for dual exp bonus.  You're right with the druid being able to throw a few heals too. Can help with quests and elite quests.  Not sure you can solo instances (especially at or around your level), as all instance mobs were elites, so packs would be tough, but could work. 
---
So it all depends on what you both want to play once you are at 60. Most combos will work well as questing together is fun/easier.
---
It's ironic that this was downvoted to oblivion haha. I agree with you though
---
Mind control 1000 people into they’re deaths
---
Yep, Druid is definitely way too low... I’ll put it in 2 or 3
---
Also a tactic that resolves around not being countered because the enemy is incompetent doesnt sound very promising.
---
Around the pits in searing gorge.
---
Sweet. I'll definitely pick up some game time if possible tomorrow (Pay Day)
---
If you switch the buttons around left handed isn’t that hard to get used to. Broke my arm and did it, very easy adaptation.
---
Warrior + druid. A tank and healer will get you groups in no time. Farming stuff together is also pretty easy as feral + tank. Good buffs for eachother and an occasional heal helps out a lot.
---
I believe the client is now free to install. So you'll need to purchase a subscription.
---
I imagine you will just need to download the client and pay a sub
---
It was just the video. I uploaded it raw.
---
Great points. It's been 12 years since I've played so I'm really just parroting back research I've done. I'll take your word for it.
---
I got a kick out of it :) thanks for this.
---
Just the subscription.
---
To be fair though, I am not sure what they are going to do this time around. I played in WOTLK + Cata betas, and we did a ton of leveling through the zones to start, then they popped up pre-made character testing to focus on endgame part way along.
---
So I am sure they will do the same. While I am sure the leveling quests "should" work, I would hope they want to test the leveling flow, make sure everything works correctly. Then focus on premade characters for endgame testing.
---
Time will tell!
---
I've played on both, and there's nothing I liked more then being on a PvP server but playing peacefully, only messing with people when they mess with me first. 
---
That said, I'll be playing on a PvE server because I don't think it'll be like that anymore. I played on a private PvP server and the people trying to rank just take corpse-camping, flight master camping, and ganking people trying to reach 60 to new levels. It's absolutely miserable trying to travel anywhere or do anything. And there's enough action on PvE servers (during phase 2 there will be at least!) to suit my tastes.
---
Unknown information at this time, 50/50 whether you have to buy the current game or not.
---
I wouldn't actually mind Nomi randomly showing up on an April Fools style event in Molten Core or something.
---
On the subject of spamming heals. Getting kicked in vanilla means "You are Dead" and I would be like. Thats okay! If i knew that trying to fake cast also means that i am likely dead!
---
Nothing personal but I don't want political memes from another countries.
---
The objectively better machine is number 2 if you can afford it, but 1 would work fine. 
---
Honestly do you need a laptop? If you don't need mobility go build a desktop.
---
Thanks man!
---
That's an exception to the rule, but most jobs will be done worse/tasks will take longer if the employee is distracted.
---
After all the employer pays for you to spend time working not playing games
---
Will I need to UI my...unauthorized WoW that I use to play on  [redacted]?
---
hey at least you just need a sub....I've not gamed since 2012, and uptil that point my Desktop PC was new in 2008....so I need to upgrade and get a new gaming laptop (need it to be mobile cos of working away). 
---
So I need to reactivate my account, add game time, download wow again....and all once I buy a new gaming machine...haha :)
---
Yes, but do you realize there are players not in the group competing for those drops as well?
---
Wait wait wait. You mean Classic client or retail client?
---
Fuck off bitch. I play games all day at work
---
Every single class has a higher skill cap than 99.99% of the players are capable of reaching.
---
It was announced at last blizzcon that classic will be included in the wow subscription, [https://twitter.com/warcraft/status/1058430660266749952?lang=en](https://twitter.com/warcraft/status/1058430660266749952?lang=en)

i think you need to chill
---
If you go for it, cleave tanking scarlet monastery rocks
---
Skilling weapons in vanilla was a huge pain the ass too.
---
What? You mean hearthstone stuff?
---
- Solo: 100% mob xp
---
- Duo: 50% mob xp
---
- Threesome: 39% mob xp
---
- Fourgy: 33% mob xp
---
- Fifthwheel: 28% mob xp
---
Duo leveling is getting more attention lately. twice the kill speed, less resource use so less downtime, so even though you're getting half xp per kill, your kill rate is more than 2x so it's overall a win.
---
For 3 person, you've got to maintain 2.5x kill rate, which is still manageable, but start running into respawn issues and lack of mobs, slowing you down.
---
Maybe they will do 5/10 level character jumps so people are not having to do the very long levelling process from scratch.
---
Not everyone lives in their parents' basement tho.
---
they don't do system scan anymore, so setups doesn't matter
---
Are you sure? I'm positive they said some of the glitches were because of the translation from BlizzPC&lt;Server&lt;OurPCs. 
---
We could be talking about two different things though.
---
yeah, its gotta be a laptop if I wanna play.  I might be playing sparingly to begin with....but can "work late" sometimes and get on the laptop till 5-7pm.... I can play while at work (lunchtime), even if its just leveling fishing or something. 
---
Also, I'd need to be able to play from the sofa....or the wife Aggro would be huge!! ;)
---
It's not hacking at all.
---
Mortal Strike in a raid, I must protest at the waste of a perfectly good debuff slot!
---
Wait for classic. Completely different game

Why would you run the Bnet launcher with WINE? You only need to run the WoW binary with it.
---
The retail client is free. I would think you would download that and the classic "client" would be contained within it and you just select a different server for classic. But I don't think that's known yet. Either way, if the retail client is free I doubt you need to pay for classic outside of a subscription.
---
No. I suggest you watch the recreation of wow classic video that they showed at blizzcon.
---
phasing = being put into a different version of that area based on quest completion. eg if you did the quest to set sentinel hill on fire but your friend didn't, you can't see each other at sentinel hill.
---
sharding = being put into a different version of the zone based on population.
---
i really doubt it's anything to do with either those because when you get phased or sharded, you. can't see the other player. that's kind of the point. and they can still see your whispers, it's how me and friends would realize we were sharded, because we'd whisper each other for like 10 min trying to figure out why we couldn't see each other before realizing. 
---
i think it's just a bizarre change to hide /say on flight paths, for whatever reason.
---
You may also only ever listen to Disturbed, LCD Sound System, and Songs About Jane era Maroon 5.
---
Personally, I’d lean towards Druid. Mostly for the ability to heal and stealth.
---
Have you considered shaman though? Warrior + shaman is the bees knees.
---
I never really had a problem with it, it's something I actually enjoyed since it makes sense rpg wise for me lol.
---
That sucks :(
---
Thanks for trying though.
---
You are very immature and irresponsible even for a 12 year old. You don’t fucking play games at work.
---
Nah you're just wrong
---
If you play by the real monopoly rules, game should only take about 2 hours.
---
They've stated that all you have to do to play classic is have an active subscription.
---
decent chance you may need to pay for early access to the beta , other than that just sub
---
Running 5s with some friends at 60. I was instantly interested in the game, but didn't really love it until we were in strath and I realized the fact that we all had a role and were playing them very well and having fun chatting in ventrillo.
---
  / target anrende, cast deathgrip
---
yeah, it is a pain, but hopefully your team have your back, tougher in pugs but sometimes you get good pugs.
---
So on the subject of back against the wall, I have been trying work out how to move accross open ground without being jumped and one of the ways I have found is Holy Nova (Rank 1) spam which is doesn't cost much mana at all, and due to fights like a 2v1 being so short - well the loss in Mana rarely would matter. 
---
Equally I haven't seen any spec's that incorporate the Spirit of Redemption. I imagine that this is rather good in AB, where you can die and sustain someone REALLY well with no negative impacts to yourself. Especially in Blacksmith fights for example!
---
I have seen alot of this tri-spec but I feel like its more for dueling? or am i wrong about that? I can't imagine its overly effective as a healer!
---
&gt; just because you call something summer does not make it true. Summer is the time between the summer solstice and the fall equinox
---
So that's how you call it? Okej then, you'll play on a private server
---
&gt; Also, I'd need to be able to play from the sofa....or the wife Aggro would be huge!! ;) 
---
I bought a new laptop for this reason alone ;)
---
There are several people suggesting using bootcamp and windows, but most people probably have never used a Mac as a production tool, otherwise they'd know better than to suggest a dual boot solution. This is my main machine and the only way windows gets into it is into a completely isolated virtual machine.
---
So bootcamp is a huge no-no for me.
---
Ohh that's true indeed
---
I had a friend who played TBC at work. He worked as a security guard on night shifts. Literally his job would be to sit on his ass, walk around the building every hour and call the cops if any alarms went off due to breakins.
---
He said 40min out of every hour was spent drinking coffee and doing absolutely nothing, so he saw no reason not to play the game.
---
Also on that note, certain people don't want to "spoil" Classic for themselves by playing it in advance.
---
While I would love to play the beta, part of me also wants to stay away to keep the novelty of waiting until release.
---
I'll get the code cart in a minute, beta is coming. Gotta check my preferences.
---
&gt; error
---
&gt; Unfortunately you may not be eligible for this offer.
---
Well that's probably why.
---
Very true. My work in a way never ends. I dont mean that not as depressive as it soinds, but at my current job there is always something to do in a good way. I could always go to one of our clients and drink some coffee for example.
---
If i would start playing games im fucked, rightly so. Even if it is slow.
---
i forget what tcg was available during vanilla.
---
i would hope they dont allow any of the tcg released after vanilla
---
Well that is really good to know to be honest! 
---
Thanks.
---
Horde because friends. Alliance because after 4 horde male characters tauren and orc to max level, leveling as a night elf female in that awesome zone with all of the colors and vegetation vs. barrens was amazing
---
its a temporary fix for a temporary problem, even if it is throughout the world its not going to be for long.
---
At blizzcon, Ion said it would either be a short beta or no beta at all, so it's hard to apply this information to Classic.
---
hmm, they didn't scan my pc specs now like they used to in the old days??
---
NIN and Rammstein.
---
&gt; i really doubt it's anything to do with either those because when you get phased or sharded, you. can't see the other player.
---
that's probably to avoid DC or weird things during flights - flying players have some meta-phase, where they're visible from all phases.
---
Funnily enough, I hadn't even considered the fact that there might be another healer with me. \*Facepalm\*
---
I feel like the Beta will be like the "Open Beta" week they did originally near WoW launch.
---
Get enough people slamming the servers for a week to see how the sharding in early levels is liked/hated by the community (and servers).
---
If it helps, there's not really going to be a need for a invitation-style beta for Retail currently (batch-updates during a current expansion are usually free-to-enter with no codes/invitations) so the only notification you'll get is for Classic.
---
Yes, definitely. Would take too long to level to 60 just to test instances, etc. They will want this feedback for sure and I'm sure there will be raiders that want to test.
---
Nah, i've been invited and played numerous wow beta's with no active sub to live.
---
That's not how I define summer.  That's what the definition of summer is.  Refer to your closest dictionary.
---
Well I will have to say that my last experience with trying to level on a pvp private server was on the one that has like 8k players on it and is super overcrowded...so maybe that has caused this thinking for me.  On that server you will be fighting the opposite faction in every map you go to constantly after starter maps.
---
Personally I feel guilty about betraying my WoW spirit and thinking about going pve for the first time ever.
---
In the end I will probably not be able to do it and will roll PVP anyway.
---
You guys have definitely restored my faith in pvp over pve for server type too.
---
I'm thinking about rolling priest when classic drops. How hard will it be to gear a shadow priest? Can I heal and still be eligible for shadow priest gear in raids?
---
I think the case is pretty different for Classic. Theres just SO much game that it's hard for even a team of 100-200 people to wring out any bugs or inconsistencies. 
---
A beta should be monumentally helpful in making sure it's 100% set. Just a short one though.
---
huh, i didn't know that! interesting, ty
---
I'd go with the Acer. It's mostly cause of personal experience when it comes to laptops. 
---
However it's also 200£ cheaper and the most noticeable difference is the 1050ti over the 1060. 
---
While the 1060 is a better GPU both laptops are capable of running wow with no issues, and the Acer also has a larger screen. 
---
In my personal experience I think 15.6 is too small for gaming.
---
[Only 38% of Redditors are from the US.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/325144/reddit-global-active-user-distribution/) What are you even talking about? You deserve all the downvotes you get.
---
my friend had that game. it was a Royal pain for my young as self to set up. but it was hella fun.
---
The common response you're going to get here is that "PvP is part of the whole experience". Guys will say the world feels more alive with the constant threat of being attacked.
---
This is true in a perfect sense - you and an enemy cross paths questing in a neutral zone and duke it out, it develops into a small skirmish, and fun wPvP happens. This all happens with farming spots, nodes, black-rock mountain, world boss spawns, and it feels more organic because you can't opt out. One of the craziest moments in Classic for me was when we were getting our MT Thunderfury and an Ally guild caught wind we were doing the raid boss, and crashed us. They arrived just as we downed the boss and had a huge 40v40 battle.
---
However the imperfect happens too. Guys who rushed to level 60 solo now gets ganked repeatedly in max level zones by better players / guild group, so he takes it out on lowbies to teach them "what it feels like". 
---
You start one of the memorable skirmishes listed above, win, only for someone to "hop on their main" and corpse camp you for an hour because they're pissed off.
---
All popular quest zones hubs get crashed repeatedly, and turning in quests can become an hour+ task. Guys claim this isn't greifing because they're "baiting out level 60s for real wPvP", and have no problem using you as fodder.
---
Server balance is also important. If you end up on the low pop faction on a PvP server, getting anything done in a popular zone during prime time is not going to happen. 
---
So really its up to you. If you go with a PvP server, you have to take the good with the bad. PvP still happens on a PvE server as you can flag, but it'll be less organic.
---
Personally I'll be rolling on a PvE server as in my experience, ganking is far more prevalent. I'll roll with PvP toggle on but I want to be able to opt out if some jackass is just greifing everyone.
---
Here are some options you have:
---
1. Talk to the group before-hand.  "Rogue, is it okay if I roll on leather agi gear, since it's still BIS for me?"  If he says "yes", you're good.  If he says "no", you can choose whether to accept that, leave the group, debate the topic, or just say "ok" and then ninja loot.
---
2. Just join a group that doesn't have a rogue or druid.
---
3. Watch to see what the rogue does.  If he rolls greed, then roll need.  If he rolls need, then either let him have it, or say "do you mind if I roll on it, too?"  You can then use the same options as in #1, depending on his reply.
---
4. Ignore the implications and just roll need on anything that's an upgrade for you.
---
5. Just roll need on everything.
---
Thanks!
---
s h a r d i n g
---
Or, because a hunter has upgrade options not available to rogues.
---
Your scatterbrained conspiracy theories do not equal a "decent chance".
---
Yes, you need the client, the files are not the same.
---
It's possible, they might also stage things. For example, testing just the starting zones 1-10 for a week or so, then we can probably skip the 10-20 zones (as I think we had a demo of that for blizzcon so any bugs were worked out) then 20-30 etc.
---
Paladin has some pretty useful abilities if you hate eating and drinking all of the time, which you do with some classes. I'd rather kill a little slower and not eat and drink, but that's just me. So, what do you do on a paladin? Use your seals and judgements of light and wisdom, change your blessing to wisdom even. And you have the option of forgetting all of that and judge go ret and hit harder and take the downtime once in a while.  [https://imgur.com/a/aNm8V#5](https://imgur.com/a/aNm8V#5)

I think it's the last line of yours that rings most true.  What was frowned upon varies from server to server and from person to person.  Communication resolves those issues (either by the group coming to an agreement, or players finding different groups that fit their loot distribution).

There are literally dozens of YouTube videos about this, the first 3 versions of wow to reflect on, and private servers for someone to make the decision. Using a beta for that purpose is selfish and not the point of the exercise.
---
Outside of aq and naxx every class is beyond viable. Play the fantasy that grabs you—if you’re worried about not picking the “min/max” class decision...just focus on min maxing your own characters potential. Few people care that hunters do less than a mage by the end of bwl. They will notice who the top hunter and bottom hunter are, though.
---
As long as it's communicated first.  Even if the leather is BIS, it's better for a rogue to get a leather upgrade and a warrior to get a mail/plate upgrade, than for the warrior to get leather and the rogue to get nothing.
---
hahaha, I joined a guild in vanilla and they all worked at the same hospital, like RNAs, Doctors, Anastheiologist etc. and they asked what my 16 year old self did, I gquit on the spot hahaha
---
If all you want to do at engame is heal .. Paladin is god tier.  Leveling is slow, but you have so many tools to deal with any situation, that there is nothing you cannot handle. You will die a  lot less than the other healers and you get increased running and mount speed. 
---
You get a free level 40 mount, which means you can spend silver and gold on upgrades for gear. Many classes have to grind it out later or not buy stuff, like their spells. 
---
Pretty much no downside to a paladin who plans to heal in vanilla wow.
---
What is hard to understand that several people can cover a larger area? The mobs dont spawn on top of you.
---
you're right sorry. I was tired and cranky last night.
---
On the virtual ticket downloaded demo you could type /LFR and it would open the LFR window. This was not possible on the blizzcon clients, implying that they were running different versions of the client.
---
It kind of does have priority.  Which is better:  warrior gets mail/plate and rogue gets leather, or warrior gets leather and rogue has to vendor plate?

---
lol the look of disbelief/betrayal
---
The thing is, warriors have more options available.  So if a warrior and rogue both want leather, the rogue should get it (or should have the option whether to take it or leave it up to /roll), because if mail or plate drops later, the rogue can't get it.
---
Warriors are always going to have better synergy with healers due to no self-healing and the way rage works, PvE or PvP. There's just no contest. Even Feral off heals are better than nothing. A geared warrior can probably duo any dungeon with a healer, just go fury and facetank everything. 
---
Duo-ing dungeons or whatever with a hunter/warrior could still work, but the hunter would be doing like 80% of the heavy lifting. Warrior can tag along, DPS a bit, but can't contribute much without heals. It could be fun to take that challenge though, so I would pick whichever you enjoy more.
---
I'm going to have to disagree with you there mate. Low level crafted wands are absolutely broken and do insane damage. They're completely worth making since you don't even really have to go out of your way for them.
---
Those arent gameplay/balancing tests. Most imprtant thing is to find out if the transition of the old DB to the new engine worked. In classics case quantity over quality.
---
Thats a long walk. I hope you packed some good boots and extra socks!
---
Are you tenting or sleeping indoors?
---
Just roll a dwarf paladin. You are a walking tank who can heal. Your biggest problem will be being cced and mana bured by the other team. They wont waste their time trying to kill you .
---
This is correct.
---
Awesome! 
---
I think my plan is herb/skinning till 60 while saving cloth mats to level up tailoring at 60. Then drop skinning, level tailoring, make truefaith vestments then drop tailoring for alch. 
---
Thats my thinking anyways.
---
Yes it is.
---
For a dungeon, a mob is worth:
---
((basexp *2) *1.4) /5
---
- *2 for being elite
---
- *1.4 for group bonus
---
- /5 split among a group of five.
---
Level 31 for example, base XP is 200. So if you're level 31 killing a level 31 mob, you'll get 200xp.
---
Level 31 with 4 more level 31s, killing an elite 31 in a dungeon, everyone gets 112xp
---
Thing is, though, it still leans in favor of the hunter.
---
Leather blue drops - hunter and rogue roll need.  Hunter gets it.
---
Mail blue drops - rogue can't use it, so greeds.  Hunter sees he greeds and got it.
---
Now, there's no guarantee that the mail will drop if the leather dropped before, but it's situations like this that make it so that hunters should at least ask before rolling on leather armor.
---
So you don't want sharding so you can get the excitement from tagging a mob before someone? Even if it doesn't have the vanilla feel, its better than competing with 50+ other people for one kill quest.
---
When the game came out, my friends and I started on a PVP server. Once they quit, I stayed on a PVP server until Mists. I could not level once I got to Valley of the Four Winds. I was constantly killed by groups and groups of players. That was when I decided to switch to a PVE server. I never cared for PVP to begin with; I only stayed on a PVP server because it's where I originally rolled. I do not miss the frustrations of being on a PVP server. When I'm playing, it's to relax, upgrade my character, and have fun. For me, personally, PVP is no fun.
---
In modern WoW, you still have to pay for access to the latest expansion.  Everything else comes with the subscription.  In  Classic, you'll just have to pay for the subscription.
---
RIP moon walking :(
---
PvE, your pet's armor is what matters, and that doesn't come from gear.
---
PvP, armor does nothing against half the classes anyway.
---
Welp, guess it's time to quit the job, divorce the wife, sell the kid and jump out of a moderately high window so I can claim disability for the next year while I play WoW in my underpants. Man, launch prep is going to keep me busy!
---
It's exactly the opposite for me. World PvP takes away a key aspect of the game. The *game*. :D Others should never be able to interfere with my enjoyment. I've had enough PvP on private servers. PvE all the way.
---
I didn’t know that
---
&gt; If you're healing an instance close to the lowest level you can zone in, you make excellent xp, way better than grinding &amp; questing in the world.
---
way wrong. +4 level xp bonus caps at 20%. And with group xp split, and division among the levels of the other players, you're lucky to get 4-5% bonus of already shit low xp.

There was a video of a GM going nuts and killing anyone who entered a room by the ZAndalari trolls in STV during the release of ZG and I can’t find it anymore. Pretty sad because it was some anime shit.

I don’t have a question I just wanted to mention that. I thought GMs were godlike entities back then
---
"Redemption? What? What is class quest?"
---
I played private servers.
---
Its not that im worried about getting into the 'wrong' beta, im just worried about a lot of invites going out to people that arent interested in Classic.
---
If there was an option for just Classic it'd be narrowed down to far fewer people to start with, which would mean much better chances for the people that are excited to play.

I didn't even see that! My b

I seen alot of Sham content, I think that they well be quite popular. Thanks for the advice I'll defo take it on board!
---
Im rolling warrior
---
I hear Priest has alot of Downtime too?
---
I think Redridge is popular because it's a place that you're almost guaranteed to find a good density of victims. It's a relatively small well populated low level contested zone and you don't have to search very hard to find ganking opportunities.
---
&gt; I played nostalarius and boy let me tell you questing In the starting zone was ridiculous but worth it and fun 
---
Playing nostalarius on launch day was NOTHING like playing WoW on launch day in 2004. There was very little competition due to shitty servers and people bad internet / computers. 
---
Even though we haven't had a blue post confirming how they are going to use sharding a whole, having it in zones 1-10 wouldn't effect your community game play much. You're going to hand TONS of people around you and still have to fight for mobs like you did, it just wont be AS many. Youll still have to fight to tag mobs. 
---
Think of it this way. IF they didnt use sharding at all in the 1-10 zones, you would login and be surrounded by HUNDREDS of people more than likely. If each server holds 2500 people and there are 6 starting zones that is 420 people in northshire abby. Good luck getting ANYTHING done. It would take you a few hours to hit level 6 to move onto gold shire and probably 10+ hours to hit level 10 to move onto west fall. 
---
That to me is not fun. Spending 10+ hours doing something that could be done in 2 hoursish isn't my definition of fun. Now I know some people would like that, but a majority of people wouldn't like spending 10 hours to do something they know could be done in 2. 
---
Unpopular opinion #prosharding1-10 
---
I personally want to take a week off work and no life this shit and be able to enjoy it. Fighting against 420 people for the same damn vermins or pups for hours on end is not my definition of fun.
---
The hospital, like a PUG raid group, made the mistake of settling for “any healer it could get”
---
I played a priest throughout vanilla. I was able to get to r13 as well. I led many premage bgs, WSG AB, even some AV runs.  
---
The biggest thing to remember is this is a TEAM game. If your team leaves you alone, then you are going to get killed and contribute little to nothing. Now when you are dead, the rest of your team is dying because they are not getting heals. The environment I ran in, people figured out quickly that peeling for a healer was priority number 1, then focusing down their healers was priority 2. Best to try to play with people that understand this.  
---
Make a buddy with a solid Frost Mage. They will make your life so much easier. We used to run a frost mage protector. His sole purpose was to spy OUR healers and keep them from getting popped.  
---
If you are set on playing a priest, just remember PWS might be costly, but it is the difference getting one shot and having time to react. I tried to keep that up + renew. Pre healing or prepping for the inevitable rogue/druid/warrior is essential to priest survivability.
---
ALSO a huge thing to remember is positioning. There are low spots or Line of sight objects in all of the BGs that can give an advantage and keep you our of direct sight of the enemy. If you find these locations and use Line of Sight properly, it will also GREATLY increase your [survi](https://survibility.You)vability.
---
You will of COURSE die a lot, but there are many little things to help. When BigAxeBro warrior charges you and crits, your face is likely going to melt.  
---
Paladins are snooze mode in pvp as a healer IMO. Yes they are more tanky, but they lack a lot of support that the priest can supply. They are amazing for healbotting 1 target and are cancer for melee classes, but imo Priests were far stronger in pvp early in the game.
---
Just remember priests are incredibly dependent on group content and group participation. They can't just stand there like a pally and be successful. If a group works around a good priest healer though, they take a dump on a pally healer.  
---
Just my thoughts.
---
It's annoying as F because, only ilevel matters. Get a BIS trinket? nope it's useless because, it's not Titan forged so it's a downgrade.  Every week pray to RNGjesus. It sucks the fun out of the game.
---
I thought that was the Plaguelands' "Welcome Bear."
---
You say like that is a bad thing. Let me rephrase it for you - 
---
"Only Druids have battle rez in classic"
---
Now say it loud and proud!
---
Hey I actually work at a school so I'd love a June release date.
---
ED was always there and doesn't SWPrison refer to the stockades?
---
This is very true and hadn't even crossed my mind. One of the choices my Duo Partner is looking to level is Mage, would that be a strong combo to AOE farm with? Or would I be holding the mage back by not really providing much?
---
To my original paraphrasing of blizzard though that could be because they brought blizz hard drives and didn't use new. Going around the translation error. 
---
We're both making assumptions here. So, who the fuck knows lol
---
I'm not sure what your life situation is but under normal circumstances I'd go for an actual desktop over a laptop if possible. They're far superior and you get to get to play an a decent sized monitor, unless of course you're going to buy an external monitor to go with it whihc further defeats the point of a laptop. 
---
For your actual question though there's minimal performance difference between both of these laptops so unless you've got the extra cash to chuck about then I'd say it's not worth spending the extra money on the second one, especially considering you're using it to play WoW. (and the cheaper laptop has a slightly larger screen.)
---
Definitely back in the day that was case. I'd say people are a lot better at the game now, 14 years of practice helps.
---
dude... no. Just no. This cant be real
---
I'm chatting with a blizzard rep, and they said buying the 180-day game time (or any amount of time) will immediately start the subscription.
---
I'm rolling horde for the first time, specifically Orc. What is my levelling route likely to be like? I've never started on Kalimdor! Exciting.
---
Alot of people will tell you warrior + healer = win, it is true. Druids are super fun to level up aswell. 
---
I am here to tell you how good kiting is when you are doing elite quests. Hunters can kite most of anything and the warrior can slow them down and execute them. 
---
On top of that a good hunter can CC really well inside dungeons. And you can make life easy for your warrior freind. 
---
Pick Hunter if that is the class you feel for.
---
I'll have to dig deep to find someone who can help. Thanks for sharing the link though, I might get lucky.
---
The current understanding of the way classic is monetized is strictly the subscription. There is no upfront cost for the game.
---
Does any of the pots like FAP etc make you immune to being kicked? If so then I can see these being really useful for the issues that I am seeing!
---
I do feel as though having these potions in abundance weekly will be an issue though.
---
You can also be an asshole in another game. Try that.
---
I just did a quick search on eBay for "WoW Atlas" and found 13 of them for sale. Starting at 4.95!
---
The demo was a completely separate client, and considering the datamined Beta still has the Vanilla login screen, it would be incredibly surprising if it WASN'T a different client.
---
People who played back then didn't even remember that warlock pets were instantly dismissed when starting to summon another pet.
---
There is a lot of misinformation about true vanilla WoW, including people not remembering things as they actually were or private server clowning.
---
I wouldn't say quickly get bored, this shits gonna last at least a couple years. Just look at how long people have been playing private servers.
---
Or trolling us.
---
Mid BC I had a part of a guild bank go missing, I believe my account was compromised when moving to college, something like a week before my physical authenticator showed up.  
---
The guild bank was restored thankfully, but I ended up with a single instance of vanilla wow collectors edition pet item, at this point I don't recall which one I chose to unlock, but my account only has a single Vanilla collectors edition pet!
---
I understand exactly what you mean. If the setting comes later, perhaps with a Blue Post, all the better.
---
If not, then betas are always done in waves, so eventually I feel anyone interested in the Classic Beta will get a shot, and perhaps also clue in some retail users who are interested in trying it out. That can't hurt much either (even a retail-user can submit a bug report if Furbolgs are clipping from the ceiling or an escort quest being broken).
---
0.5 × 2 =1
---
Hey man, to each their own, right? 
---
I can get behind your logic, I guess I just have never personally experienced the game without open PVP, so I suppose I shouldn't be chiming in here.
---
Should say in the title it is only for NA...
---
Lol holy shit boomers are so toxic 😂
---
Good luck reading the TLS encrypted data.
---
I would if I could edit it, Although at the time I didn't know it was NA only i'm sorry
---
What, leveling a shaman is way easier than paladin lol.  Once you get frost shock, you can kill mobs without even getting hit if you want.
---
I'm looking forward to current WoW collapsing when new players try classic and decide that challenging, rewarding content was missing all these years. 
---
/S
---
I have heard the saying about PVE servers "If it's red it's dead".  I have a friend that has always played on a PVE server and he says that all of the time lol.
---
Honestly, i'd say *how* inefficient it is depends on a number of things... Do you know the people you run dungeons with? Are they good? Do you run it 3-4 times on repeat when you get there? Also, since there may not be dynamic respawns, is grinding/quests harder to do?
---
No matter what, it will be slower than open world questing/grinding. But it might not be *as* slow of an option in comparison, in the way Classic may work. Personally, I'm just gonna do each dungeon once, twice if a friend invites me, 3-4 times if i REALLY want some of that loot, like Ravager.
---
Thank you for the explanation!
---
Druid...so many possibilities.  Damage output of any spec is so bad, really hard to kill people that are skilled at the good dps classes.  You can do damage as feral but you really gotta work for it and be a shifting god.  
---
Best WSG flag runner hands down.  Had some epic runs on mine back in the day.  Basically were rated bgs, would get the same guys every game, super high skill level.
---
There are some really sad people who only want to disrupt others levelling on the big servers. 
---
I’m all for getting ganked by two horde around my level in their level appropriate zone, but when a 60 is farming shimmering flats just to piss off people levelling, it’s not fun.
---
Lower pop on classic compared to pservers should go a long way towards fixing this though.
---
Nice! Thanks for the repost, appreciate that!
---
Maybe [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8UzwM1Zt3M&amp;t=0s) will help you decide.
---
Thunderfury
---
Got it by the tbc prepatch but it was super useful all the way to black temple
---
No, thats faulty.   There are items where the leather is bis for the warrior.
---
Getting teabagged is part of monopoly.
---
You did have a little time to play around during your breaks should you choose to, but the novelty of a lot of it wore off pretty quickly during training.  By the time we hit the GM floor most of us were focused on helping players, but different GMs explored their powers differently, it's sort of what made us such a powerful group, we all had a unique experience.
---
For those of you planning on doing the 6 month sub.
---
```
---
6 months x $12.99 = $77.54 ($12.99 per month)
---
   $77.74 - $20 = $57.74 ($9.59 per month)
---
No Linkin Park or System of a Down? Do you even 2000’s teenager bro? Seriously though, cheesy as it is, I totally intend to quest to early 2000’s music at least once in a while. #nochanges
---
Me every day
---
I had a virtual ticket so I played the demo and tested the /LFR bit, while people who played it at blizzcon reported that it didnt work for them. I downloaded the demo a few days before blizzcon so it would seem that blizzard sqeezed in a new patch/build right before blizzcon that they choose to not push out to the battle.net clients but only included on the blizzcon physical PCs.
---
Thanks, man. I'll likely purchase this.
---
I didn't think there was any other way to download the game? either way didn't want to spend too much time messing with it
---
I said in my post to buy as a gift.
---
That site was fairly useful. Thanks :)
---
I had that as my wallpaper for a long time! Memories!
---
3 hours is way too long for a podcast unless you're stoned listening to joe rogan IMHO.
---
In retail wow (classic will have same rules) if you denied an important quest giver or npc (stoutmantle, Wiley in redridge etc) for anything more than one or two respawns it’s considered a bannable offence for griefing.
---
This is on pvp servers
---
If you are going to level exclusively with a Mage, then you can level as Holy/Prot which would be great for rounding up mobs and then let your mage AoE them down. Also you can provide mana return to the mage will will reduce his downtime. This would be a fantastic leveling combo.
---
If you are leveling alone, then you will be killing things very slowly, but still remain a walking tank.
---
buy an SSD and put Windows on that. 250gb ones are cheap as hell nowadays. otherwise you're SOL without buying a new computer it seems
---
No they still won't the game is too complex to have a skill cap. Using abilities is a small percentage of it, things like positioning and knowing your opponents next move can always be improved.
---
Most used commands were definitely teleport to player, teleport player to us and insta kill a bugged mob.  Most player requests involved those.
---
We generally wouldn't mess with other GMs in game, but out of game Oh yeah!.  Never leave your GM workstation unlocked, 100% you are getting your desktop background changed by another GM.  I Rick Roll'd everyone telling them new SC2 footage was released.  Lots of trash talk around Super Smash Bros and Foosball ;)
---
Better safe than sorry though.
---
I like trying to make money because it makes other parts of the game less stressful. It allows you to do fun things like put fiery weapon on a skinning knife to let any alt level to ~10 really quickly.
---
And one of their most famous prebis - edgemasters is mail
---
It all depends on servers, some go for 2k, some for 200g. We will see in classic I guess.
---
/* laughs in software engineer
---
Exactly.
---
I'll be the first one to defend ganking. It's perfectly acceptable on PvP servers. If you don't want the chance to be corpse camped whole day by some disgruntled no-lifer, don't roll on a PvP server.
---
It's just absolutely not something I'm interested in in the game. I play to relax, unwind and enjoy the sights. Or occasionally do a more focused dungeon. And when the time comes, raids. Never ever I'm interested in fighting other players only cooperating with them.
---
It's just annoying when people go on about how PvP is a "core aspect" of the gameplay or someone who rolls on a PvE server "misses half the game". No offense intended. ;) No, they are not.
---
Latest blizzcon said all you need is the full price subscription for wow. It covers both games
---
So if my pc CANNOT run bfa, it cannot run classic either?
---
Great deal, but expires 4/26.  Anyway to purchase time to active at a later stage?  Like a gift card or something?
---
If I'm remember correctly I don't think there were any specific quests for any one race.
---
MOST quests are faction specific, exemptions exist in neutral quest hubs, and all classes have specific quests for them only. Some classes have more than others (Druids have far more than Mages, for example)
---
How does world pvp work on PVE servers? I’ve always played on PVP, and also consider PVE server this time around
---
\&gt;Using a beta for that purpose is selfish and not the point of the exercise.   
---
In what way does testing out different classes hinder me from playing the game and giving valuable feedback though?
---
But not for the rogue?
---
Actually I don’t believe they used the word “all”. They did say that you need an active subscription to play though,
---
Today's $14.99 is 2004's $11.14
---
I think the life of a healer is way better in classic than retail.  Retail has every class with 3 gap closers and interupts and stuns and bullshit that just forced the healer design to devolve into running around spamming instant cast heals.
---
Classic healing was way more nuanced and rewarded positioning and initiating the fight.  
---
Eg, you get opened on by a stealth rogue as a preist.  You trinket the first stun, or maybe the second depending on gear, then you instant cast fear the rogue if you need to heal, or you dot them if you dont.  Dotting them prevents them from reseting and/or saping you with a blind.  
---
This is like worst case too, since priests had no poison removal and rogue poisons were devastating to casters when stacked.
---
I dunno, this never felt right to me. If your a rogue in a group with a hunter and the rest are cloth/plate guys, it always felts awful having that hunter get mail loot uncontested while still rolling on all the leather. Sure, BiS is BiS, but it's not fair that Blizzard's lack of balance gave characters with less armor options(cloth &amp; leather) so much more competition for loot while plate/Mail wearers had much less/none.
---
Out of the 4 armor types that could drop, wasn't it enough RNG just getting the type you wanted to actually drop? Things like a plate wearing paladin can roll on all healing gear all the way down to cloth still doesn't seem right to me. I feel like it should be treat like offspec gear, you can't need on it over a main spec, but if no one else really needs it, then it's fair game.
---
Agree 100% mate!
---
"I can definitely out DPS this enemy before he kills me."

Man that boot must taste good.

Thank u, this is a great help 😀
---
How do you sign up for beta?
---
A handful of people.  I had a sizable IRL crew I was already playing WoW with before I got the job, so they all knew, and one of the lead officers in my guild knew as well.  Most players in my guild had no idea though, I did a pretty good job of keeping it mostly separate.
---
Who expects to wear Tier 2 at level 40 ish? Great post.
---

---
That would be PvP servers - the mentality there is kill or be killed, and for good reason. You are far better off killing your opponent immediately and getting the jump, as that largely determines who wins the fight. You do not want to be the guy corpse running as you need to rez, buff, eat, etc. before fighting again, and the opponent is looking for you.
---
If you leave them alone and hope that they're nice and leave you alone, you're going to have a bad time. They will wait til the have the advantage then gank you anyways. It's not about fair fights, it's about smashing your opponents face in immediately and without warning.
---
Hayven Games, sadly dude passed because of cancer. He was very young, around 25 I guess.
---
I chose this one.
---
Not really an issue when levelling though. Warriors will roll on mail and leather when Leveling.
---
What?  It may be for the rogue as well.   I'm saying they have an equal right to the item.
---
Healer needs to use fade. (My shaman still has my crappy green fade trinket from BC hellfire in the bank because you never know when you could need it).
---
I'm hoping for a third server dichotomy in the future. A no BG no DHK's PvP server. Only "natural" pvp throughout an entire server life, instead of creating phases that cater to both "wants" they should just turn it into another server option. I believe an RP-PVP server of that nature could be the coolest Classic experience ever.
---
If the leather is bis for a rogue and not for hunter,  I'd pass as a hunter.
---
Did you get to visit GM island?
---
I meant it as general look of the character - a holy warrior of the light, instead of wearing a "slutmog" because it gives good offensive stats.
---
&gt; How about the **hundreds** of hours of entertainment you're going to get out of it?
---
Casual...
---
Hello Mikimao,
---
It definitely was possible. Do you know a GM named Vehldane? I did manage to kill a GM at level 1 but got banned after placing a ticket saying no hard feelings. I also noticed Vehldane standing in the exact same spot on several different realms. I assume the GM characters are duplicated between realms or something?
---

---
Maybe!  I think for when I got to the job it was perfect in time.  At the time I had no work experience other than working in Ice rinks and selling online game currency, not much of a resume, so I was thrilled to be making over minimum wage.
---
This is more a game industry thing and not Blizzard in any way, but the Game Industry does tend to be below market value.  Near the end of my stay at Blizzard my job description was typically associated with pay 25% higher had I not been in the game industry.  
---
Upon arrival though it was incredible, and really helped stabilize things for me.  I thought it was a great entry level job.
---
I believe they used the phrase "included with your subscription" which implies no other requirements
---
Id be alliance but I refuse to be grouped with gnomes or dwarfs.
---
Do you have to remap your entire keyboard or do you just shift the keyboard down the desk so you can hit that WSAS?
---
Wouldn’t that actually imply the opposite considering your subscription that it is included with is to the current game?
---
No it's PVE because on PVE everyone is yellow unless their pvp flag is on...which means attack on site if players have red names.
---
Whaaaaaaaaaat?!
---
Well apperantly GRRM reads this sub and got hyped, because he has locked himself away in a swcluded cabin retreat trying to finish Winds lol..
---
Priest health is 1337
---
This was always how I felt too, A plate guy should have just as many opportunities as a Leather guy for upgrades in a dungeon run. But if DPS Warr can roll on leather too, it gets unfair really quick for those Rogues. 
---
I see from the perspective that ask what gear can a rogue get for upgrades vs a Warrior. Rogues are limited to leather only, therefor they should always get first dibs on all leather. Otherwise a rogue would be a terrible choice to gear up because everyone thinks it's okay for any agi class to roll need on leather.
---
lol not sure how that was supposed to help
---
So warrior gets BIS piece and then gets another piece later that the rogue can't use.
---
Or rogue gets BIS piece and warrior gets an upgrade.
---
One is better overall than the other.
---
I would think the ones that were around back then would be in but there hasn't been an official stance on it as of yet.
---
Technically yeah, but uncommon.  It probably was more common from a higher tier GM than the tier I was on.  Had I had the idea to do this, I probably would have cleared it with someone else higher up before I attempted it.
---
Think someone linked it before in the comments, it was just during blizzcon.
---
AFAIK, there's no official information out on this yet. Ultimately, it's one of the things which will NEED to change, either making the TCG loot unavailable, or implementing a different way to obtain it.  The worst case scenario is that they implement them as microtransactions, in which case we might see Spectral Tiger become Sparklepony 2.0 (can't actually remember if Spectral Tiger was in Vanilla, or if it was added in TBC).
---
Personally, I'd love to see some kind of in-game raffle system for TCG loot. During the week, players could give gold to the original TCG turn-in NPC in Booty Bay, and then every Sunday or whatever, a random winner is then decided weighted by total entry fees (1 gold = 1 raffle ticket or such), and that winner receives a random piece of TCG loot.
---
It'd be a decent gold sink, but by keeping it random it's still possible for more casual players to occasionally rock up with these amazingly rare items. It'd kinda preserve the original wonder of the TCG items, along with the mystery of "were you lucky, or rich?" And there are all kinds of tricks they could implement if they want to dissuade people from farming thousands of gold to invest in these raffles.
---
I still only have DSL...
---
Mage/Hunter are both great, IMO. More micro with the hunter but mages are beast when geared in PvP/E, nimble and excellent flavors of CC between freezes, poly, CS.
---
Never for a hunter to 60 but I had several friends who were good with them and loved them.
---
Spirit of Redemption is a joke aside from when it was bugged and allowed you to cast resurrection.
---
He can also read the sidebar....
---
Im ok with both, i can can good look in glorious armor while killing evil or look sexy while killing evil
---
Does that work now without /cancelaura now?
---
It may not depend on the server type, guys said that all the time in my guild on a PvP server. Regardless, the point stands on PvP servers. 
---
Completely up to you what you want to play, just be prepared if you pick PvP.
---
Because there's multiple perspectives on this, the answer is not "roll" or "don't roll", but "communicate."
---
It's $15 monthly and you don't have to buy any games. This is the cheap option, don't act too entitled.
---
Nice find - I'll try later today.
---
...It's a World of Warcraft subscription. So you get access to Retail AND Classic.
---
I also wish this would happen. But I'm pretty sure it won't. All we have heard so far is that classic will be included in the retail subscription.
---
They specifically said classic would be free with your subscription. You don't have to buy any game to have a wow sub.
---
It's cool that you've said that because one of the things that drew me to a healer this time around as opposed to playing my usual War/Rogue was the fact that they actually have to cast but now that I'm trying things... It's actually a struggle because I can't live long enough to get one off!
---
No way!  As soon as I clocked off I was one of the players!  I was leading a raiding guild on the Horde side and we controlled the flow of Rank 14s on our server.  I personally got to rank 13 before I started valuing sleep above PvP points, lol.
---
Hope so, most of the bugs I want to look for are at lvl 60. 
---
Definitely want to make sure the In Dreams quest is working and not bugging out.
---
You going to want holy reach if you go that deep.
---
Generally, Acers are low quality. They generally don't last as long. They've always been geared toweards people with low budgets, so their quality isn't as good imo.
---
I always wanted to get this version of monopoly. I'm so jealous.
---
I hope they still sell it.
---
Weird how I haven't thought of that myself... I'll have to check how much cloth is needed in order to gain max level.
---
Your plan sounds great since you'll be able to vendor skins for your 40 mount and class skills. However the amount of cloth stacks needed might be an issue in terms of bag space (character and bank).
---
*cough* [Beastmaster's Tunic](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22060) *cough.*  
---
More seriously: armor ends up being not that important in the long run PvE-wise. Kiting means pet's armor is meaningless unless the mob has a cleave-like move. On the other hand resistances and stamina are important and they do come from gear (just check any tier set bonus, usually the 4-5 set one) for any AoEs mobs/bosses may use. 
---
The PvP statement is just right.
---
The beta client.
---
One of my personal favourite possessions. I own the boardgame and both expansions, and I even paid $100 for the Blizzcon-only cards (armour sets for each class).
---
Take 4 to 5 hours to play through, but man is it satisfying. It feels more like WoW than WoW feels, these days.
---
Nope. Your PC would wipe if inactivity was detected.
---
This is the exact situation where a hunter can get 2 upgrades vs a Rogue who only had potential for 1 upgrade but got none.
---
This is my perspective on the matter and why the Rogue should always get priority on leather, at least the 1st piece that drop in a dungeon. Else you leave it open to unfair situation like your example.
---
And if you have not baught the last xpack you also get them for free (up until Legion)
---
Funny thing is there was a doctor at the place I used to work at who actually used to do this 😂
---
There was lots of TCG in vanilla. Spectral Tiger being the most famous. There were a few mounts and pets and a bunch of toy like items.
---
u only get full access to retail if u also bought bfa tho
---
&gt;Druids have far more than Mages, for example
---
Bad example. Mages have a lot of class-specific quests. In fact, there is one every 5 levels or so.
---
I would give you some Reddit copper if I could figure out how
---
By default, yes.  But the hunter also has the right to ask if it's okay to roll, and the rogue can agree to that.
---
How would that even be possible? The current WoW client is on a completely different expansion.
---
See this I disagree with, warrior has less tools sure but if you know how to squeak extra miles out of them it can get really complex
---
Weird.  I had a couple of experiences like this (although not specifically arena, I was off the GM floor by then) and standard protocol is I would tell the person to finish up what they were doing, and find a safe place to log out.
---
On a real rare occasion whatever the offense is might warrant getting someone out quicker, but that's real case by case, hard to speculate.
---
That’s not exactly cheap in any way. Cheap option would be WoW doing a Runescape and only requiring a game purchase or a variable sub fee based on what you play.
---
$15 a month for a game with everything figured out and a similar experience has been free for the last couple years kind of sucks. I guess your simply paying for no China and shady admins.
---
Can confirm.

---
You can flag yourself manually for PvP by right clicking your portrait, or by attacking them in a faction controlled zone (like if horde invade stormwind, you can attack them, which will set your flag and they can attack you back then.)
---
If you're both in a contested zone like STV you both would need to set the flag and then you can fight basically. Some people run around with it all the time, some don't.
---
 I don't remember what you had to do to turn the flag off, but I think there was some short timer (like you couldn't turn it on, kill someone, and turn it off right away always).
---
No, they are shared in your group as well.
---
Lot of drinking if you cast a lot. Paladin feels smoother, shaman feels like more fun...but a lot of downtime when you’re not melee heavy IMO
---
And you know, a legit copy of the game where you can't lose all of your progress overnight.
---
Haha!  I have no idea where I will end up when classic comes out but I definitely plan on playing it!  I'm sure something can be worked out! ;)
---
 What is the name of the boardwalk property in this game?
---
Problem is the pool of players who do put in a lot of effort for PvP is rather low. Every class has a high skill cap, but 90% of BGs this won't even matter. Holy Paladin for example will seem braindead easy when not being rushed down by a coordinated deathball, then all of a sudden you need to learn positioning, consumables etc.
---
Yeah, priest doesn’t have downtime if you stack spirit and go spirit tap and wand spec. Absolutely. I just meant the rotation is pretty boring. I’d much rather level a priest than paladin...but I’d rather PvP on a paladin at 60 BY FAR as a healer.
---
Runescape has a $11 per month sub fee. You don't have to purchase anything but the sub for retail. Literally the same damn thing.
---
"Free" isn't the right word here, technically illegal is. This comes from someone who used private servers and supports using them if Classic has too many changes.
---
That's not true. You get all the expansions for free until Legion. You get all of that content...for free with your subscription.
---
Yeah but it’s getting FAR LESS for my money now when I don’t plan to touch retail and now 14 years later we know everything that is coming to classic. Back then I paid a sub not knowing about what the experience will entail.
---
We’re just getting buttfucked by blizzard when private servers did over 50% of the work for them. It also costs MUCH LESS to run classic compared to 14 years ago. 
---
There should be a smaller fee just to play classic for those reasons alone.
---
Dude, i just saw you own a fucking Rolex and bitch about a few dollars per month spent on a game you like? 
---
Really, this is the reason why we can‘t have nice things. Get outta here!
---
Their only downside really is they burn through mana fast so you drink a ton
---
I agree, communication is the key here. If I'm that DPS warrior who after that BiS leather item, I prefer to not run in a group with rogues who need it. If they do, I'll just find another group. Same with if I'm the rogue and the warrior wants to roll on a much needed leather, I'll just find another group. 
---
I just see it as inefficient otherwise, because my rolls can't ever be relied on.
---
Probably because the Nost people were actually pretty based and you could make an argument that they were the main catalyst in getting blizz to actually do this project by showing how much interest there is. Most other pservers are run by pretty scummy/shady folks.
---
I'm sure it's technically doable.
---
Thank you for posting these. If anyone from Blizzard is watching these threads, you should consider putting your old art sectiont back on the website. It was always nice to see the fan art or the official art, whether it was shots like this or pictures taken from the sons of the storm (RIP) and the TCG. If I recall too you can find these picture in the Stormwind Gallery.
---
you look stupid as fuck.  I would never invite you to my group
---
You paid 15 dollars a month for the original game when it came out too.. stop being entitled.
---
This will be the case against anything with any level skill.  With the vanilla pushback system, you have to play other games to get casted spells off.  
---
Some examples are Jump-Strafing when you expect to get stunned, and turning to prevent gouges.  This is why certain utility spells are so important, that were removed from retail.
---
The key to defeating rogues is to defeat their stealth, and the key to defeating warriors is to prevent them from getting rage.  Priests are really strong at both of these when played at a high level.  This is why we see the infamous Priest-Rogue-Mage and variants in TBC arenas, while paladins were largely relegated to Warrior+Paladin.
---
You'd have been paying $15 if you started in Vanilla, never mind actually buying the game itself.
---
There's a surprising amount of misinformation in this thread. 
---
The people saying "it's uncertain" or "unknown" are not correct.
---
Currently, if you have a subscription it lets you play all content from TBC, WoTLK, Cata, MoP, WoD, and Legion. 
---
Currently you need to buy BFA if you want to play BFA. 
---
During Blizzcon they said that you would only need one subscription for both Classic and Retail. 
---
Therefore we can deduce that since classic has nothing to do with BFA, and since the current subscription gives access to everything except BFA, then the subscription will give access to Classic once it's available.
---
There's really not any uncertainty there, in order to introduce uncertainty they would have to make an argument for Classic having something to do with the content of BFA, which would be a MASSIVE stretch, at best.
---
Explain to me how you are getting far less for your money now? I mean, seriously. Explain it to me. You make absolutely no sense.
---
Lol your a fucking joke. Get a job,  and do something with your life instead of sitting on Reddit or WoW?
---
It was a gift from my father. It’s 30 year old watch.
---
Next, do you think people make it in life pissing away money? No they play the game of real life and succeed but cutting they’re costs. Maybe learn that ASAP?
---
You will be delightfully surprised.
---
How many times can you do this?
---
Angwe was a rogue famous for camping Menethil harbor for months during the original phase 2 (honor system without bgs). People hated him for it and accused him of all sorts of things like being a "sad people", but it got him the top spot for honor many times because people would get their mains or guild mates in an attempt to chase him away. Terrorizing lowbies is a valid strategy and adds a wonderful role playing element to the game.
---
Maybe learn basic English first.
---
Paladin is the opposite of smooth.  You sit there autoattacking and that is it.  When you run into mobs that heal you can kill 1 mob every 60s...
---
it is true because just up to legion is not full access to retail
---
considering past content is largely irrelevant, it's a pretty big distinction to mislead about.  if u don't have the latest xpac u can't do any of the content that everybody and all your friends are playing right now.
---
Damn, a whole different gender too!

Being pedantic isn’t an argument. I’m sorry I don’t have time to punctuate while I’m at work on Reddit lol.

Instructions here, it's easy
---
Hahaha to be honest, I’ll probably have to buy a new unit too.. the only computer gaming I really care for is WoW. My 200$ dell runs private servers... decent? But I’m not sure if it’s gonna work for the real deal
---
Which is pretty sweet. I'll be getting WoD and Legion for free!
---
That’s what I’m doing right now. You can get BFA on sale if you look in the right places. It has its problems but I want to play an MMO and nothing else feels right
---
Dude you‘re sitting Next to me here on Reddit! 
---
If you really think about spending those few bucks or maybe safe 7$ a month, rethink if you even want to play The game. There are always private servers for cringy people like you.
---
As a priest main who has been playing vanilla recently I think you might be worrying a bit too much. As a priest you have a lot of survival tools available to you and because you're frequently not trying to get yourself into the frontline on a BG it's actually challenging for DPS to pin you down for long enough to burn through your defenses before your team jumps them in retaliation.
---
It's about sticking with your group, but (on alliance side at least as human/dwarf) you have Desparate Prayer as a fairly beefy instant heal to counter surprise burst coupled with shielding yourself. You got your trinket, you got your AoE fear, and your shadow word pain actually does a fair bit of work on its own even in healing spec.
---
Every time you pop a greater heal and get it off you're getting insane heals and you can drop a HoT on yourself as well to help out.
---
As a healer as well people care about you and are drawn to defending you presuming you're doing your job decently. People will prioritize saving you all things being equal over other DPS etc because they know that you can return the favour tenfold, you also get a pile of extra HP from your buff as a side note.
---
Ultimately if you want to better in pure survivability terms you're going to be better off on a Paladin, but as a priest I really would not be worried about getting rekt in BGs.
---
(Also later on when you are tired of getting rekt you can swap to shadow and out 1v1 pretty much any class in the game for vengeance, just don't forget your pots. ;) )
---
It's very worthwhile testing everything from a server load perspective.
---
If I'm online on my Druid, there *is* a tank online.
---
That's the beauty of Vanilla.
---
Sometimes I think about it. But than I realise.. farming for an hour without seeing people on a PvE realm feels boring. Farming for an hour without seeing people on a PvP realm feels lucky.
---
I just need a small portion of danger thats keeps me focused.
---
I forgot half of you people are not healthy individuals. Next time I won’t ask a simple question that may not be the status quo.
---
As someone who doesn't understand the difference, why isn't it hacking? What's actually going on here then?
---
You trinket poly like any sane person, then turn around and make fun of most bad mages who miss their counterspell...
---
There are lots of technical issues involved in porting the old stuff into the newer infrastructure. Anything from databases storing spells differently to textures not looking the way they are supposed to.
---
See [this panel from Blizzcon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM) for more information.
---
We wanted Classic and they will give it to us. Now we should pay for it.
---
No additional charges and not having to buy the latest expansion is more then fair. I'm actually surprised that they did that.
---
Making sure that the code ported over correctly, this is a massive software engineering project. There are a lot of things in Retail that aren't in Classic.
---
You're right, my memory must be rusty. Edited.
---
Welp you triggered them.
---
Just buy the credit. You can always apply the credit later.
---
If you walk 1200 miles you will end up with Hunter Druid or Shaman.
---
To test the game for bugs? I’m assuming there are difference between the old platform and the new one, that could potentially break things
---
Every piece of software has bugs. Best way to identify bugs to fix is get as many people as possible testing things.
---
I wish it was for NA (coming from Canada). It's US only.
---
I honestly hate PvP servers. I just want to collect my 10 bear asses in peace without being ganked by 1000 undead rogues/mages/warlocks every 5 minutes. World PvP is nice in concept, but in practice, it's just ganking. Nobody ever attacks you unless you're already fighting a mob, or low on health/mana, or some other disadvantaged state.

It's in the terms and conditions...
---
&gt; Blizzard Offer Terms &amp; Conditions:
---
Get $20 off when you purchase the World of Warcraft Complete Collection or any single purchase of $59.99 or more with PayPal at Blizzard . Valid from April 11th, 2019 until April 25th, 2019. Offer limited to one per user. This is a restricted offer that can’t be shared online or with others. The minimum spend for this offer is $59.99 USD.
---
I've had two, no issues bar the power lead developing a faulty connection in certain positions on one and that was after about 5 years of ownership.
---
Going by this on average, it looks like \~4 months.  Darn.  I'm guessing **late August**.
---
Unfortunately, the wife would go nuts if I sat at a desk top and played wow kinda being anti social...haha. However Sitting with it on the laptop I can grind away, chat and watch tv all at the same time. Also can take the laptop to work, play at lunchtime, play after work and pretend I’m working late.....haha
---
If the laptop can take running instances without an issue and pvp without lag....then it’s  gotta be a laptop for me. 😂👍
---
Clearly you have much more time to dig through someone’s post history lol
---
Betas tend to be good for marketing, yes, but keep in mind this is pretty much a 'rebuild' of Vanilla, not a re-release. A lot of the software that Vanilla was built on is out of date and would not run well at all on modern computers. Since a lot of mechanics have been rebuilt with newer software, it's worthwhile to test the mechanics on a beta.
---
Blood rage icon looks like an orc with moose antlers.
---
God bless you
---
Wasn’t it a one time purchase originally? If not maybe I just though it was.
---
In general, if it is a one of a kind drop from a named mob it is shared. Otherwise, it is not.
---
This guy pvp'd.
---
Anyone that says priests are bad in pvp is dense.
---
I worked in a shop repairing laptops for a few years. The amount of Acers that came in was staggering. I will not buy anything by acer because of that. Glad you’ve had good luck with them though.
---
Was like 30 seconds. When i see toxic comments like your‘s i first want to see if they always behave like this. 
---
You posted a thread and don‘t give people the opportunity to change your mind. I don‘t see the reason in that than just trolling
---
Hahaha guess we’re both in the same boat then 😂😂
---
You took something extremely political and controversial, and made it into a funny meme about classic. I am struggling to understand why anyone from anywhere would be offended or bothered by this meme. If there was collusion to kill Mankrik’s wife, we need to know. This is a unifying issue that goes beyond national borders.
---
I'll save you a trip there bud :)

The keyboard is a little shifted down but really not that much. It looks the same as a normal set up, just keyboard and mouse reversed. Honestly the most difficult part of left handed gaming is finding a good ambidextrous or left handed mouse.

Classic is a recreation of Vanilla. However was in Vanilla, so it will be in Classic.

(Yes, there will be *some* changes but they are not really important for your quiestions.)

---
Beta testing serves many purposes to ensure that when retail goes live, the general player base has a smooth experience and won't lose their shit with youtube videos that blizzard's image even further.
---
Haha make a post if you find a good deal!!
---
&gt;even taunt has a use in vanilla PvP.
---
Would this be applicable to pets, but not enemy players? I dont remember the exact taunt mechanics..it would force aggro for NPCs only?
---
What? Your mad because you couldn’t persuade me? On the other hand it’s completely OK to flame me for something unrelated. 
---
You sound like a good dude.
---
&gt; I feel like it should be treat like offspec gear, you can't need on it over a main spec, but if no one else really needs it, then it's fair game. 
---
That isn't vanilla. I will roll on Truestrike shoulders on my DPS Orc warrior because they are the Best in Slot pre-raid and probably the most reasonably acquired item for the slot.

You're abusing people in the comments. Not exactly the healthiest individual yourself.

Ah okay that makes sense. Thank you!
---
I must be missing something?  It looks like I can buy the Standard Edition "Save $20 on World of Warcraft®: Complete", which includes 30 days of game time.
---
**Is there anyway to purchase $60 worth of game time (i.e. 4 months) for $40 after the $20 off???**
---
Runescape membership has always been a monthly sub. Used to play in 2004 and I play it now. Though it was $5 back in the mid 2000's and went up to $11 sometime past 2010.
---
DO IT.  Make any MAJOR changes you can.
---
Only after someone was flaming me for owning something unrelated to my quwstion. It was disrespectful so I’m going to throw it right back.
---
Look at the demo, even with internal teams running the game constantly the players found hundreds if not thousands of bugs in a matter of days.. some major and some very minor. Beta means "test server" and that's exactly what the goal is, for people to test the game out and make sure stuff works as intended.
---
Just because classic is a re-release of an old game doesn't mean anything since the entire game was put on a modern engine which is the reason it got complicated to begin with for Blizzard. Watch the classic panel where they explained even the lightning in the game was off because the modern engine couldn't recognize the old code and whatever else was happening.
---
I've been told that Hunter has a high skill cap because of pet management. But to reach the skillcap you need every engeneering item and usefull trinked in the game. Combine that with alot of consumables.
---
Abilities alone is just the basic. Using every usefull item and gearpiece on the best moments is what diffrerates the average playerbase with the modern vanilla PvP gods.
---
"you are dead" is only for paladin healers.  All other healers have multiple spell schools, and those schools are powerful.
---
If you have the option of spell locking any healer, ALWAYS choose paladin first.  It will shut down 100% of their abilities.
---
If you spell lock a holy priest spell, you will just eat a Physic Scream in most cases unless you were training him so hard it didn't really matter if you interrupted them.
---
I just got an MRI scan like 3 hours ago. Took longer than expected, so this meme makes total sense. Lmao.
---
Gatekeeping much. Maybe stop being an asshat and you'll find your stay here more pleasurable.
---
Oof. /r/MurderedByWords
---
&gt; Ion said it would either be a short beta or no beta at all
---
Source? I don't remember them ever mentioning a beta at all.
---
They had to re-implement almost everything and it's using a new modern client that is internally built entirely differently from the old one so it makes sense to take it all for a test drive before releasing it to the masses just like any other new piece of software.
---
There probably is also a good marketing case for running a beta, but as a programmer I definitely think the primary reason is to ensure everything is actually working as intended given it being a new product despite the fact it might seem like an old one.
---
Good question, unfortunately I can't remember the commands at all.  The wall clipping was one huge too, I always left that on by default on my GM characters.
---
CT techs perform the actual CT scan. Not the radiologist, who is the one who interprets the scan.
---
I ain‘t mad because i didn‘t change your mind, but because a guy normally arguing is rejected from you with a passive aggressive tone in your words. 
---
Arguing can be fun, but not if it‘s with people like you.
---
In all seriousness, what does this mean for a release date?  How long do Betas normally last?  Can we actually expect the beta to be short and the game ready by July 16th?
---
If you're not interested in retail don't play retail, problem solved.  There's going to be just a WoW subscription, it will include access to retail and classic.
---
Have fun in Hyjal
---
My bet is 60 days.  It’s enough to go over major bug fixes and confirm if things are working properly. 
---
30 is too low, and 90 feels long enough that something was wrong.
---
Not that it would be incorrect to do so...
---
A few guidelines to help you:
---
Intel processors: 8xxx series processor is the newer generation than 7xxx processor. 8xxx is more efficient, less heat, more battery life, slightly faster than 7xxx series.
---
you definitely want a SSD for the OS and WOW.  Biggest performance increase over HDD.  This alone is way more important than a slightly faster video card or processor.
---
Here's some I'd recommend:
---
 £100 over your budget at ,  £1099 but this gives you a better display with 120hz and variable refresh rate as well as 8th gen i7 and gtx1060 6gb, 1tb storage plus 128gb ssd:  [https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASUS-Strix-GL703GE-GC053T-Gaming-Laptop/dp/B07C7V469F/](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASUS-Strix-GL703GE-GC053T-Gaming-Laptop/dp/B07C7V469F/) 
---
Here we have a cheaper option at  £910.  drops down to a 60hz display without variable refresh rate and a gtx1050ti 4gb, but you get the same 8th gen i7 processor, storage and ssd as the above model:  [https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-Pavilion-17-ab404na-Gaming-Laptop/dp/B07F2NHSRG/](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-Pavilion-17-ab404na-Gaming-Laptop/dp/B07F2NHSRG/) 
---
and here we have another option at  £915.  This drops down to the previous generation processor, still i7, but 7th gen.  In exchange for dropping a processor generation you get 16gb of ram instead of 8gb that the other two have.  you also get 256gb of SSD, but only 3gb of vram in the gtx1060 3gb model, you're also getting a 120hz variable refresh rate panel with this model:   [https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASUS-GL702VM-GC182T-Kabylake-i7-7700HQ-GTX1060/dp/B01N7R4J3Y/](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASUS-GL702VM-GC182T-Kabylake-i7-7700HQ-GTX1060/dp/B01N7R4J3Y/) 
---
If it was up to me, I would pick the third option because for me it's worth dropping a CPU generation in order to get double the RAM and double the SSD storage.
---
The 8750H specs can be found here:  [https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/134906/intel-core-i7-8750h-processor-9m-cache-up-to-4-10-ghz.html](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/134906/intel-core-i7-8750h-processor-9m-cache-up-to-4-10-ghz.html) 
---
And the 7700HQ specs can be found here:  [https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/97185/intel-core-i7-7700hq-processor-6m-cache-up-to-3-80-ghz.html](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/97185/intel-core-i7-7700hq-processor-6m-cache-up-to-3-80-ghz.html) 
---
You're getting 2 more physical cores and 4 more virtual cores with the 8750H, but for gaming (specifically wow) you won't notice the core drop.  I'd prefer the additional SSD space and system RAM (also, 1080p won't use more then 3gb of VRAM anyway, so dropping from the gtx1060 6gb to the gtx1060 3gb isn't an issue).
---
Oh I totally want to roll on shit "for transmog" in classic.
---
Hmm, that could be due to them being a widely distributed brand that doesn't have a long warranty unlike Dell/HP etc.

\*\*&lt;Knights Templar&gt; - Alliance |NA – PvE| Semi-Hardcore\*\*
---
\*\*Introduction:\*\*  
---
Knights Templar roots were established during World of Warcraft’s launch on the Zul’jin |US - PvE| server.  Our guilds mantra was “The causal guild that raids hardcore” and we will continue with that mantra during Classic WoW.  We accomplish this by having a very casual guild environment, but a very focused and dedicated raid environment.  We expect to progress through raid tiers in quick order.  
---
\*\*What we Expect of Members:\*\*  
---
We are looking for members who share the same mantra that was referenced above.  All members are expected to be respectful and polite when dealing with other members of the community.  It’s important to remember that when you join our guild, you represent us at all times.    
---
For raid members, you will be expected to show up to raids on time and prepared to pull by raid start time.  We also expect raid members to be well read in our raid strategies and able to follow the raid leaders instructions. 
---
\*\*Guild Culture:\*\*
---
We want this guild to feel like home, as it did for the members who were part of the original KT guild!  We are committed to building a guild environment that is friendly and helpful and is respected throughout our server.  
---
\*\*Raid Times:\*\*  
---
Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday 8:00 -10:30 PM EST.  Sundays will drop off when content is on farm.
---
\*\*Guild Website:\*\*
---
&lt;[https://www.ktguild.com/](https://www.ktguild.com/)\&gt;
---
\*\*Discord:\*\*
---
 [https://discord.gg/Se55Scg](https://discord.gg/Se55Scg)
---
\*\*Recruitment:\*\*  
---
Our raid roster is filling up, but we are still accepting all classes!  If you are interested in joining feel free to join our discord channel (invite above) or message Papacy#2992 or Drobu#2181 on discord with any questions.
---
Oh no, not racism and dickishness against an extra dimensional horde of savages that invaded your world, burned down your capitol, started two wars, and butchered thousands of your people in a demon fueled blood frenzy. The fact that orcs were just interned and not straight up exterminated speaks to the Alliance’s restraint, and I say this as a lifelong horde player.
---
Sure the orcs under Thrall had mostly reformed, but if I was an Alliance leader I wouldn’t be taking any chances, and neither should any leader that truly cares about their people after all of the shit that the orcs had started.
---
Still good to see. Some people were getting riled up they wouldn't do an alpha or beta. One more rumour addressed.
---
How do you stop a warrior getting rage? I understand the general principle but getting away from a warrior can be a tall feat. I tend to rely on rocket helm and position swapping them on charge.
---
This is a good representation of one of the Priests watching the group get absolutely slaughtered by Razorgore while he’s gotten a Divine Intervention.
---
For things like yup there's the upvote button not a one word comment come on man
---
A lot of answers already. It’s basically a free bug report. As well as a stress test and whatnot. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a long beta like for other retail expansions.
---
A gm investigating a bugged mob once turned himself hostile in front of me during tbc prepatch. I used the Opportunity to cast searing pain at him, it dealt damage and he was immediately healed to full after.
---
Doesn't that just buff the distance of Holy Fire and Smite? Do you cast these alot as a Priest healer?
---
Look up Joanas leveling guide for fun. You will see what he means by going back and forth between zones. I think he went 4 or 5 times to the Barrens alone.
---
What does that mean?
---
You literally came at me with an ad hominem logical fallacy (attacking me or my possessions and not my statements) and your talking about arguing. Get over yourself.
---
I’m 29. I don’t play games at work. Thanks.
---
Thanks dude!
---
I will play PVE. I have played on PVP servers exclusively since vanilla, but to be honest, I never attacked other players. I just dont think World PVP is fun for me.
---
I think it means we're still a little bit aways from a beta
---
Worked for me, thanks!
---
I do understand as I work in IT/tech support. Use a VPN and a separate pc with account info not linked to your real life credentials.
---
I interpret it as they're in the alpha phase and they're still prepping for a beta phase, but any beta announcement is still a ways away. Gotta internally test beta rollout options, etc.
---
I’d recommend making sure to have the client and everything downloaded early since it took a long time to download the 60GB game even with 150/150 internet and an SSD.
---
I‘ll better get over this conversation.
---
Oof
---
The entire game had to be rewritten from ground up for 64bit processors. 
---
If they tried to launch the old game on current equipment it would fail to run due to how different processors were back in vanilla. 
---
This means they need to make sure there arent any major bugs or glitches in fight sequences and quests and such.
---
So while the rogue is wearing greens with no upgrades the whole run, while you are getting slight upgrades as Mail &amp; Plate shoulders prior to killing Pyroguard Emberseer. Then when the Truestrike shoulders drop, do you still need on them because they're BiS?
---
My whole point is that your action may be affecting some one else, and at what point do you try to be fair to your other party members?
---
There are a few major quest lines that everyone gets, the Ony attunement comes to mind.  As for class quests some classes have it better than others, for example warlocks and paladins have nice quests at 60 for epic mounts.
---
Confirmed working for me. Got an email showing the -20 off. Thanks OP!
---
I so wish I did. No Bills, free food. When I was living in my parents basement (literally I was) after the army I was dating the hottest girl I ever dated. Wish I could go back, golden days.
---
In this case you had one of the issues that may get combed out of the queue.  If someone was stuck and a GM could fix it real quick without needing to contact you, we would do it.
---
The main thing is Seniors would always keep an eye on the queue for urgent issues, like a gold spammer going nuts in Orgimmar, and get those kinda issues resolved before it caused problems for to many.  If they happened to see a stuck that was 1 button click for a GM, you might get scooped out of the queue that way.
---
It wasn't a guaranteed way to skip the queue, but the main idea is we wanted the players playing, not waiting for us to answer them, while still maintaining the queue order for the most part.
---
I wish I had money to do this right now!
---
Which tends to be the case I have found that damage is so high that kicking isn't a huge deal and if they do one global for them rarely affects their damage but kicking me at the end of a cast usually is deviating for me!
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP
---
So I don’t play retail, so for the same money I paid in 2004... operational costs are less, no active development costs on code, more efficient ticketing and GM systems. It simply costs less to run classic than it did back then. 
---
But I didn’t factor in inflation, so maybe it’s not as big a loss in value than I thought.
---
I still think it should be a little less per month though.
---
I’d highly recommend hunter. You get aspect of the hunter at 20, and you can make it 36% move speed in the beast master talent tree. That’s some great movement speed for world travel, and hunter’s have all kinds of other abilities to be slippery and kite enemies. Plus the class is easy to level and very fun. There are other viable classes that people will mention but this is my recommendation :)
---
Found the rogue player.
---
I would say Hunter if she likes hit and run gameplay. Hunter always gets dumped on as the noob class, but a skilled hunter can keep 2 players CC'd while mana draining a healer in PVP. Requires a lot of micro to do properly, but is very rewarding when played properly. Low gear requirements make it a competitive class too.
---
Mage is also good for hit and run with high mobility, but is more of a glass cannon class. Expect to wreck many classes in pvp -- until your cooldowns are gone and you get 2 shotted by the MS warrior with hand of justice. Warlocks are also a tough kill for mages. Dots eat up the lifebar very quickly when you go up against an affliction lock. Felhunter is also your worst nightmare.
---
Rogue can be fun too, but the mobilty really isn't there as mentioned earlier in this thread.
---
Druid has shapeshifting and can get out of snares easily. Probably the most mobile class in the game. Expect to go feral or resto though, and raiding will only want you for the heals or AOE tanking in niche scenarios.
---
It will give you 20% range on Holy Nova, which is a pvp staple for instant healing, killing snakes, and de-cloaking rogues/druids.
---
Both.
---
“Like....” yes I understand very well. You’re not bestowing any new wisdom here. I’m looking at it from his circumstances, of being paid $10 to already be on the computer. Numerous ways to get around being caught. Sorry if my language deeply offended and made you feel like you had to educate me on bills/maintaining your job.
---
iirc the numbers for quests in classic are something like 1200-1500 for horde compared to 1000-1200 alliance as they started working on horde quests earlier and never got around to adding the remainder of alliance quests, not sure where I remember this from though so my source/memory may have been wrong
---
You sound stupid as fuck. I would never invite you to my group
---
They choose who to give a key generally. If you already participated in a beta and provided feedback, your chances rise
---
Fair point, but I think the less greedy option for Blizzard is to do like a variable sub (classic or retail+classic) because it costs far less for them to run and manage Classic now compared to back then.
---
Good god OP. Lol
---

Nobody ends up looking like the female unless the try.

If 15$ per month is going to break the bank you shouldn't be focusing on video games.

Yeah you can do really any mix of specs and still dps/heal depending on your situation.  This video explains it well:

Man Im so tempted, but committing to 6 months of WoW and paying upfront???  Thats a gamble.  Who knows what time folks will really have, and if the game will live up to the nostalgia hype etc. 
---
I've been fooled so many times by buying full priced xpacs and quitting 2 months later.  Hesitant.
---
Actually they're my 9th favorite class in the game.
---
It says new account required on the blizzard site after claiming the offer in paypal. 
---
Did you create a new blizzard account?
---
Pretty much that.  We had different data bases for everything and iirc we had a command line we could turn on/off at the top of the screen (could be remember this wrong) but the general concepts were there.
---
Mostly we used these commands,  Teleport to player, teleport player to us, instant kill to fix a quest and spawn items if you were a specialist.  We all had to set our levels to 60 with all our characters as well, but in general our actual in game running around was fairly limited.
---
Then you should probably enter the big leagues and play EVE.
---
Is notre dam in Paris? Yes? Then ...Paris
---
Think of it this way, due to inflation 15 dollars in 2004 rougly 20 dollars today.
---
Value of money has changed over the years, subscription fee however has stayed the same.
---
It’s just the principle of the matter that annoys me.. because IMO, it costs far less to run Classic now than it did then. I just see the $15 sub as a greedy solution compared to other game purchase options like variable sub fee or one time purchase.
---
It’s not that I can’t afford it, it’s that I don’t agree with the value I’m getting with the sub fee personally (since I don’t touch retail).
---
If there is no rolling over beta characters to live I don't see a huge amount of hype for the beta. The main things I can think of are figuring out the UI again, getting used to how things look and feel and maybe mapping out the first few questing/grinding paths. Personally I wouldn't spend a lot of time in the beta because I would just burn myself out and have less hype when I have to start 100% over again. I recently played on a private server just to do the above and only made it to level 15 before deciding that was enough for now. I am saving most of my hype for when I can actually get full access and not just a taste.
---
This problem is easily solved by not playing with hunters :D
---
You’re lucky that the Mac has lasted that long IMO. Back then You could even interchange parts on those machines - what a dream, right? Technology has advanced sooo much since your computer was made though. Instead of paying $3k for a brand new high tech MacBook Pro, what if you bought a refurbished Mac that’s a couple years old? You could save a ton of money, get very solid performance gains both for gaming and work, and run WoW.
---
Debating on either Orc or Undead warlock. 
---
Not sure if i want to dedicate my race to a 25% stun reduction or be an edge lord with WOTF
---
PvP server for sure, because momma ain’t raise no bitch. 
---
Going to be fun actually seeing my character go from “weaker” to “op” once the phases start releasing! 
---
Plus, who doesn’t want to sit at 100% health as a SL lock while everyone melts to your DoTs and Shadowbolt?
---
Medivh, the **HUMAN** GUARDIAN OF AZEROTH was part of the conspiracy to corrupt the orcs and open the portals. Humans are more susceptible to Fel Corruption than other races.   
---
So just to recap:
---
&gt;  extra dimensional horde of savages that invaded your world, burned down your capitol, started two wars, and butchered thousands of your people in a demon fueled blood frenzy. 
---
Was actually caused by the Humans. The Human race as a whole may not have known (just like real Orcs are not down for the Fel Corruption and whatnot), but it's just the first example of Humans fucking Orcs over, then blaming the Orcs.
---
Yea I mentioned this in another comment, that at least inflation is helping realize the value now.
---
I wish more people wanted to play monopoly, like noone really wants to play it that I know lol
---
I meant Pathfinder

Classic WoW 2004 - MPQ
---
Classic WoW 2019 - CASC
---
The tech behind getting this to work, and the manual editing of every table in the game to sync up to the modern client means the amount of bugs and unintended consequences of the changeover could be game breaking. They need people to test everything they can to make sure the port  and rebuild worked as intended.
---
Yeah, nostalgia is nice and all for some, but I started during tbc and I'm only looking forward to this because in my mind it's the closest to tbc as possible. Classic removes all the changes that made me "quit" wow time and time again.
---
I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more, just to play the class I want to play and not reroll 100 more.
---
lol I guess that's one way to look at it
---
I wouldn't go as far as to say 'nobody ever attacks you unless you're at a sever disadvantage', but a lot of the PVP does boil down to ganks. If you level 1-60 on a PVP server, just be aware the amount of one on one fighting you do with people at your level where they don't try to kill you while you're at low health or fighting a mob will be far far far lower than the level 60 rogues who gank the fuck out of you.
---
And you're flaming people for having an "opposing opinion". See the similarity? 
---
You were given answers, and moaned about it not being what you liked.
---
Nope, we weren't allowed to service our own accounts.
---
I remember once Petitioned in at night, and when I arrived at work the next day the GM who got my ticket (who was getting off their over night shift) teased me a bit about it =P
---
Yeah I was definitely aware, when listening to some podcasts and watching Youtube videos, that I'd missed out on a communal cultural event. It will be fun to be part of that for this last season. 
---
I wonder if there has ever been a show or film that inspired more hours of fan work per than GoT.
---
For one, they had to re-write the entire database to the new format.  There's bound to be bugs.
---
Thunderfury is bis for hunter tank btw so you better give the bindings to them.
---
The only person I flamed was the guy who came at me first with an ad hominem logical fallacy talking shit because I own a family heirloom.
---
Every other comment has been pretty civil unless they were disrespectful in the first place.
---
Why? What in my idea of more people being able to cover a larger area is incorrect?
---
*slow clap*
---
If it’s really still in alpha there’s absolute no way we’re getting a July release. Super disappointing
---
The original build that was put up contained issues where it was making requests from the wrong location. The second build fixed the issues.
---
I don't think that you fully understand that cost, you were not paying because "the infrastructure wasn't there", but rather for a few various things.
---
 15 you pay for 730 hours of customer support, technical support, and most importantly server upkeep and moderation. Your characters are safe, your data is safe. you service is good and reliable. and when you need support it is there.
---
50c a day for these features is fine when considering that fact that you can pause and resume whenever you please.
---
Wow cost 60$, now it's free. Paying for hardware and customer support has not changed. 15 dollers now is reasonable.
---
I would rather see the subs get divided and classic could probably go down in price, but i don't get to choose it.
---
And this is the kind of thing we did on Tuesdays during maintenance
---
No. You can have 1 tracking up at a time. So just ores, or just herbs, or just fish etc.
---
There was an actual Trading Card Game before hearthstone actually and it provided some loot (very rarely).
---
What server did you raid on?

They will be re including the old models and textures.
---
So, if he's tanking the dungeon because he wants true strike, he should just pass on them cuz the rogue in the group has bad shoulders? Lmao, that's a good one. 
---
This was never a mentality people had for randoms, maybe the occasional really nice individual. If I'm running a dungeon for a specific piece or two, I'm rolling on it.
---
That’s exactly the type of feedback they want from the beta.
---
Completely stripped them out of retail assets.
---
Codenames? I see you are a man of culture
---
I want to raid and do lots of BG and wPVP, I like being the high damage or high #kills player. Having trouble between mage, rogue, or hunter main (warrior alt). I was feral Druid post TBC but that’s not viable now, so I’m maybe leaning rogue, frostbolt x infinity seems boring but in BGs might be more useful? And hunter I know dps is lower in PvE, but with good gear do they own in PvP?
---
Ok, that is good to hear. Did they confirm this somewhere?
---
No idea. That's not something they've commented on.
---
Uhhh weve had inflation since 2004. If anything it costs more to run the servers now. Unless you mean development, which isn't part of running it. And dev will be on retail, untill we get something like OSR going.
---
Also if we account for inflation not only do servers cost more, but we should be paying 20.19 per month.
---
First, what is this BfA ad doing on classic sub?
---
"World of Warcraft Complete Collection" is basically Battle for Azeroth for new accounts.
---
Yes, but other hand they have to increase the subscription for the current players that just want to experience something new and that might push them back.
---
I think it's basically the same. We pay x $ and play whatever we want... Classic or retail.
---
You need to be realistic about how the early days of the game. Vanilla WoW is gonna be shoved in front of millions of players instantaneously thanks to the battle.net client. Most of these people are going to want to try the game out, 90% of them won't make it past level 10. I wish Blizz would sell it as a separate product so that we wouldn't be flooded with tourists, but that's not how they're doing it, so sharding is the best option we have of not having a 100 dead servers a month into the game's life.
---
Was it in 1.12 version of the game?
---
If not, it most likely won't be in classic
---
That's how it was until wotlk I believe.
---
Testing out server capabilities.
---
Making sure Classic is as close to Vanilla as possible.
---
He invested all his money in his dad's rolex.
---
&gt; Yeah but it’s getting FAR LESS for my money now when I don’t plan to touch retail and now 14 years later we know everything that is coming to classic. Back then I paid a sub not knowing about what the experience will entail.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; We’re just getting buttfucked by blizzard when private servers did over 50% of the work for them. It also costs MUCH LESS to run classic compared to 14 years ago.
---
&gt; There should be a smaller fee just to play classic for those reasons alone.
---
Wouldn't exactly say that's civil discourse.
---
What do you think is better for high kills and being valuable in BGs, rogue, hunter, or mage.
---
Time to buy a bunch of Mounts and Pets! :D
---
If you died three times to the point where only bandages could have saved you, then I question both the healer and the tank at that point.
---
Good to bail out.
---
All the salty rogues in here have made me realize, I'll just not invite random rogues. I mean, I'm willing to roll against you for my BiS leather pieces, but you aren't going to see them drop if I don't tank your group so....
---
Not sure. BFA has a lot higher textures etc.
---
However if your PC is 32-bit only...
---
A) yes it won't run
---
B) dude... Get a new PC
---
I just got a decent gaming laptop. Check out the Acer Nitro 5. Should run. Classic pretty well and it was only $650. If you can find a refurbed or used one, could be even cheaper. So far I’m loving it. :)
---
Yeah yeah, just worried cause I have not seen anyone mention this and it has a rather big effect on people's professions.
---
This one is hard to say, because you would have to know what else the GM found to come to that conclusion and whatever it was it was enough of a case that their Senior agreed with it.
---
Somewhere someone reported something, because a trade between 2 players isn't gonna flag anything since that is literally happening every moment WoW operates in some part of Azeroth.
---
There is an off chance it was a goof up too, but those were pretty uncommon, since there was a check and balance to it all, but it wasn't perfect.  I am glad your appeal made it through, cause that is definitely a strange one.
---
&gt; Okay, I have honestly no clue, how much work a content patch and a Release is.
---
8.2 is very likely the biggest patch of bfa. Ive seen many players call it the make or break point in bfa too.
---
Oof, this reads like someone who never leveled a paladin.
---
To 'use seal of wisdom', you give up 50% of your damage (iirc SoR was ~42-48%) and you have to judge it, AND THEN RESEAL.  
---
So you would not have full damage for 8-10s, and then you had to spend ~200mana judging SoW.  SoW lasted 10s and had a chance to get 50mana back on hit.  To even get 50 mana back in 10s you need to proc it 4 times in 10s, which was impossible, and thus SoW was never used for leveling.
---
No there use to be a raid portal in SW
---
Are we sure about that? Modern wow has had ways around it. Warlocks, Demon Hunters and Void Elves-Blood Elves can speak cross faction. They may leave it in.

No MC gear, dungeon BiS is like half leather for a fury warrior. There's going to be a lit of salty rogues this time around.
---
I played the US Closed Beta, EU Closed Beta, TBC Beta, WotLK Beta and BFA Alpha (o_0) 
---
...and I bet I won't get a Early Invite. I never get invited to Stuff I want.
---
beta is never announced, unless it's open beta. Otherwise, all you can see is the new beta category on the forums, assuming you have access to it...
---
Not to mention hunter tracking hunanoids/beasts/dragonkin etc... it would be a huge oversight if they allowed multiple tracking simultaneously.
---
As a side note, build 30113 just appeared. 
---
Seems like they're trying to get some bug reports during the holidays and long weekends?
---
How many time you were actually using wow client interface compared to the time you were staring at admin tools?
---
This will be a short Beta. Don't expect a  3 Month Beta! 
---
This is most likely just to Stress Test some Stuff that needs testing.
---
It 100% does not cost more to run the servers including inflation. With virtual computing and Moore’s Law, the cost of components has lowered year after year, but also the electrical efficiency of the components has increased massively.
---
The reason I include development costs is because part of the reason the sub was $15 back in the day was to also pay for continuing development and patches which will not be needed, at least nowhere near the scale back in 2004 with actual new raids coming etc.
---
So yes I agree with inflation, but nothing else in terms of running servers has remain constant.
---
Just wanted to say that I spotted my char. Nice.
---
So you are just a stupid douche then? K
---
&gt; 8.2 is doing a lot to fix the huge problems with bfa and releasing classic at the same time would be a very stupid thing to do.
---
not really. Despite him being wrong about the "completely different audiences" thing, the idea is very reasonable. I doubt they release within the same week, that would be unnecessarily stressful. But I can totally see both releases being within 2 weeks.
---
did the hunter ninja loot him? the boss really doesn't like him
---
I think our wives may be long lost sisters. LoL
---
In Vanilla you could only track 1 resource at a time. They aren't going to have multi tracking just like they arent going to have LFR/LFD
---
How to defend yourself as a warrior while leveling ... acceptance.  Skip right over all that denial, guilt, etc. and just accept you are by far the easiest target outside a random critter.
---
This must be the real reason azshara is unfinishes they shoot cinemtaics here! Jk i can see what you mean it does remind me a bit of those towers but, i think it has more of a lorderon style to it
---
Link for proof that it costs blizzard less? Because unless blizzard outright states its cheaper, you are talking out of your ass.
---
4:3 and 1600x1200 if it was really high resolution.
---
I don't think anyone is talking about warriors taking agi loaded leather. Lots of people saying rogues get priority on leather that's BiS for dps warriors tho, which is hilarious.
---
&gt;  in retail the focus is on endgame
---
Yes, that is exactly what I said! There is 1% of content in retail that is harder than Vanilla, but 99% of it is easier
---
&gt; but the actual content that blizz keeps developing is miles ahead of vanilla in terms of difficulty
---
So all of the new dungeons and zones are difficult, or is it just the raids -- and only when they are played at the hardest difficulty?
---
I'm wondering.
---
If 39 other people died, maybe the runback is faster than 39 resurrections. And the chance the cables fail.
---
Have you secretly played WOW as a normal player while you were off duty? If yes, have you ever told other players who you really are?
---
Nah. They did all the Alliance stuff first and that's why Horde questing is so lackluster in terms of storytelling and memorable quest chains. But Horde questing is more logistically sound because they were able to learn from the mistakes they made with Alliance questing.
---
Just finished medical school bout to do my residency
---
You fucking know I'm planning my life around classic wow
---
Yeah but after everything is released and everyone is in subbing they will add more content while preserving the feel of classic.
---
You really think they are just gonna reset and say problem solved?
---
The “get a new pc” comment is useless to me. Thanks for the response however. I cannot afford a new pc and my pc runs private servers up until legion fine. Runs hots, lol, csgo and classic games fine.
---
Your groups a bunch of shit players then anyways.
---
What? I didn’t attack the user? I provided my opinion? Can people not shit on Blizzard here?
---
Some unique quest item drops can be looted by everyone. All of the low level (anything before BRD) dungeon quest drops can be looted by everyone in the party. Some of the quests that start or require you to pickup an item ground spawn are also set up like that.
---
Its about whose money they dont already have. I learned that when i didnt get a hearthstone beta invite(after missing like 8 betas) and my friend got one within weeks of making his blizzard account. I tilted
---
Bastards! Well maybe they do replace things completely then but a lot is still in there, especially instanced based textures and sounds.
---
pop by our discord and introduce yourself! We are almost 50ppl now but we are still recruiting all classes
---
In a way I can see where you're coming from. There's a lot of bullshit on pvp servers. Watching a single rogue shut down all of Redridge while there's nothing that can be done thanks to bad level-based pvp mechanics is infuriating. 
---
But on the other hand, that persistent danger just elevates the game to a whole new level. It doesn't matter that I don't see a single member of the opposing faction while I'm out farming alligator tusks or whatever quest, that constant worry in the back of my head that I must always be thinking about getting ganked is worth all the annoyance and bullshit. Not to mention the feeling you get when you murder a member of the opposing faction who was picking a Black Lotus and then picking it yourself.
---

while tracking was slightly bugged in the demo to appear as an actual buff instead of on the minimap, during the classic demo you were only able to track one thing at a time.
---
making a dwarf priest you could not track both herbs and treasures.. so it should be addressed already.
---
&gt; Splitting the playerbase won't do anything as 8.2 has very little to draw people attention from Classic.
---
thats nonsense. Many people, very likely the majority, still prefer retail over classic. 8.2 will be the biggest content patch in bfa. There is no way that someone who is still playing bfa, even just occasionally, would ditch 8.2 to play classic. Unless they are allready hyped for classic but still can find enjoyment in bfa. Like me for example.
---
These hacking motherfucker are geniuses
---
That is literally every tactic ever devised. Every tactic requires your enemy to not know how to counter it, or to simply not counter it.
---
Because it doesn't exist anymore. The ones that do exist are infringing on a copyrighted game and brand. Since this is a sub for the official classic game it makes sense mods don't want people to advertise private servers.
---
Yes some very specific items can be but the vast majority of quest items IE get me 10 goat innards can not be.
---
I wouldn't really say secret, as players found their way there, but Hyjal was real special to me.  We got to see it in our training group before BWL was even released, it as the most amazing zone I had ever seen by far at that point.  More than a few of us spent a little time exploring there, with construction signs up and everything!
---
What were you paid? And were you able to play for free? What kind of perks were there, if any?
---
They used a program to contact the  blizzard servers that makes the PC look like it's a regular battle net client is my guess.
---
avatar/serennia has got to be the most deranged person to ever play wow
---
Your a whiney bitch cost us 15$ when we originally played cost the same now if you don’t like it stick to a subpar experience on a private server yah cheap fuck.
---
Spectral tiger wasn't available in vanilla, fires pf Outland released in 2007. as far as I know only tabard of flame and the riding turtle existed.
---
Yeah!  For the most part nothing but positive experiences!  Sure there was a little drama here and there like at any office, but for the most part I thought they did a good job harboring an environment most people could step into and feel comfortable and productive!
---
I would say timing wise everything lines up nicely.  
---
At this point assume an early-mid May beta.   
---
That gives them 2 months to iron out any wrinkles. 
---
Plus it would confirm the Osconty/July/Patchwerk kill easter egg theory.  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/?st=jumw2ng3&amp;sh=01d06089
---
Yeah mate just one at a time. However, it’s not uncommon for people to have herb and mining. To get around the single tracking function many macro Jump/space bar to swap between. Functioning similar to: if Track herb then Track ore etc.
---
Well yes, but bugger them. I'm going to try and fit five hours a day in. Delegation and having an office ftw!
---
I dread the levels people will go to in order to farm honor this time around, so I'm going PvE. I never considered being randomly murdered by (or randomly murder) the other faction very immersive, but I can also understand people who would. In my mindset (and lorewise afaik?) there is no real war in the classic era. PvP then just feels like murder hobos in my RPG "experience", an RPG that I personally feel benefits from not having murder hobos.
---
True, but you'll also be killing them way faster with more people. Goes both ways.
---
its not. People here will tell you that because - well, obviously they like Classic and Classic and retail are night and day. Despite both being WoW by name, they could hardly be more different. I prefer Classic too (I wouldnt be here otherwise) but everyone saying retail is unplayable dogshit (thats a quote) isnt capable of realizing that the approach is so different. Its like Counter Strike players saying how dumb COD is.
---
This is why I’d never be involved in an mmo beta.  Everything resets when goes live and you’ve just sucked all the fun out of it in testing.
---
This could also equally mean that alpha is ending soon.
---
Your a whiney bitch 15$ isn’t shit today just like it wasn’t in 2004. Also old school runescape required membership when it launched. Get over yourself you whiney bitch.
---
True. They never retextured the weapons or most of the armor from Vanilla except where it broke the new models.
---
Ehh people said that about 8.1.5
---
I just plan on waiting till I see my guild pick up in activity again.
---
And the rumors going around when it inevitably happens.
---
So they say something about "wow\_classic\_beta" on CDN but its named alpha in the client? Doesn't mean devs are treating it as an alpha, just means thats the client they uploaded to the app, may be named wrong. They obviously named SOMETHING wrong either way and if they put beta on CDN, I dont think they meant to put alpha in the client they uploaded. 
---
People that say we're not close are probably just trying to not get their hopes up. I think July is still very viable.
---
Oh no!  Not compromised.  Definitely not this, account ownership is taken very seriously.
---
Comp'd as in complimentary. They covered our subscription fees while I was en employee.
---
PVP was fun back when the game was new and everyone sucked. The skill gap was small and it was more of a fun adventure. Nowadays, the skill gap is huge with pro e-sports wannabes. YouTube/Twitch streamers want to produce content by any means necessary. And the general internet culture is a lot more toxic and griefy. I for one will not be subjecting myself to this. I would not roll on a PVP server unless you consider PVP the overwhelming primary purpose of the game, over questing, raiding, farming, social, etc.
---
That what I meant - people that want to play Classic will play it and 8.2 will be inferior. 
---
And I do "play" BfA and for 8.2 to be good they must lay out plans for 8.2.5, 8.3 and 8.3.5 so that there is continuation and some value of grinding out new neck stuff instead of just "waiting" for 9.0. The patch may seems big but it's quite limited if you aren't hyped for BfA :D
---
&gt;  You go back and forth and don't try to do red or even some orange quests.
---
Doing orange or red quests may not be the most time efficient way - but god damn there its satisfying.
---
Chances are you are just experiencing a gear gap that would be evident on all but a plate paladin due to the old armor DR curves.  
---
FWIW my main pvp class in original wow was a Holy Paladin hybrid spec teamed with a Mage.  The mage switched to Warrior in tbc.  This is going to sound very controversial, but imo Paladin+Mage is insane in classic, and miles better than paladin+warrior.  The notorious combo was always Shaman+Warrior, and I feel Paladin+Mage was the alliance version.
---
It is tough to give proper advice, since at low level gameplay, melee was pretty fucking bad in pvp.  The meme about mages styling on warriors is not wrong, and my hunter alt was frequently able to style on all kinds of bad melee players and healers alike.
---
Mages were feared in classic for many reasons, and I think people underestimate or forget their pvp dominance.
---
I played an ele shaman in high end raiding from TBC onwards. Even the BiS sets often looked funky and caused upset amognst your mages and locks.
---
Yeah its sad for sure. But that's because many vanilla vets were heavily burned by this (especially the younglings), including myself. I have to agree overall tho, a well run LC is THE best option for loot distribution. I just also believe LC has no place AT ALL in a casual or even semi-serious guilds... the potential for abuse is too damn high...
---
Ok, that's nice to hear! cheers
---
Well old WoW ran off a HP ProLiajt BL25p server blade that supported max  1 dual core 1.8ghz processors, 32gb max ram.
---
Nowadays we have servers with double or quadruple the ram, 4-8x the cpu performance for similar or cheaper prices.
---
I don’t know what they’re using for official classic but it will be much more robust in specs compared to 2004
---
disable the cape
---
turn around 
---
enjoy the view
---
Good point, they get their upgrade and I keep doing runs for the shoulders. The rogue GTG or the next day comes. This time there's another rogue wanting that item while I'm short of hitcap. Back to square one.
---
The drop chance is 10% afaik. When is my turn, and what makes that fair?
---
You have no clue what you are talking about. Positioning is less relevant than you think and only applies to certain classes. You act like 1.12‘s complexity is on the level of a moba like Dota 2, which it is clearly not.
---
If it’s red it’s dead is the answer to the question of why a level 60 would corpse camp a level 15 in redridge mountains. It’s the motto of the griefer on PVP servers. On PVE servers it’s kind of a given that if you are flagged it’s because you voluntarily want to PvP.
---
That isn't proof.
---
Name checks out.
---
Top three I would say are:
---
1. Druid (reasons: powershifting, understand the strengths and weaknesses of each of your forms and the abilities within each of those forms). 
---
2. Hunter (low skill floor but high skill ceiling due to weaving abilities between auto attacks, pet management, being mindful of the dead zone). 
---
3. Warlock (pet management mainly).
---
If your primary goal is to test for your own purposes to choose a desirable class, you necessarily are not testing for bugs, inconsistencies, and remaining hold overs from retail.
---
There can be crossover, but your own stated main purpose is to do the opposite of testing the game for developments sake, as there will be no iterations on class mechanics or balance save perfecting the vanilla experience.
---
Internal alpha testing
---
[Just for you &lt;3](https://i.imgur.com/CxHZk6R.png)
---
My best guess is that you got caught in the crossfire of using a known bug but unknowingly using it in a way other people had used to grief others.
---
This is kinda funny because as a player I can see how this accidentally happens, and as a GM I can see how you could be skeptical they weren't aware of the bug when so many players try to play off the fact they were exploiting the bug as you didn't know.
---
My only other guess would actually be that warning + other violation may have tipped you into suspension zone.
---
Fairly certain that was originally meant to be for player housing. Need to find the source on that though.
---
I'll address each of your points.
---
- If you are going to make the assertion that 15 dollars a month was more reasonable to pay for infrastructure costs then you need to provide some evidence that infrastructure is somehow cheaper now. Blizzard is not using servers from 2005 to run classic on. They have updated their infrastructure for good reason and that has costs to it. You have also entirely ignored the amount of inflation that has occurred in the last ~15 years. If you account for inflation the cost of an active subscription today is only 11.50. Your 15 dollars *right now* is worth considerably less than it was in 2005. Continuing to pay the same 15 dollars right now as you did back then means you are actually paying Blizzard considerably less money. $11.50. Also another side note, if you think Blizzard hasn't had to deal with the brunt of inflation on their infrastructure costs you are dead wrong. 
---
- Remember you are completely forgoing the initial 60 dollar buy in that covers initial development. They have been working on this project for a while now and they have had to pay developers that entire time to port the old client over to the new client. They are eating all of the upfront costs. Also your 15 dollars also covers your retail sub. You may or may not want it, but its part of it. It still impacts you because there is going to be a number of players that will crossover from BFA because of this where as if they had made classic its own special subscription they would not have even bothered. More players to play with is good for you and good for everyone playing the game.
---
- In the end the cost that they are going to charge you has nothing to do with how much it costs them to make it. This is a for profit business and the price of this product is exactly what people are willing to pay for it. The idea that Blizzard needs to break even on this is actually absurd. They are totally allowed to make a profit and without that profit there is no incentive to keep making good products. Is 15 a month worth it if you log in once a week? Maybe not. Is 15 a month worth it if you are logging multipule hours a night, yea probably, but it's still up to you. What other form of entertainment are you going to buy at 15 dollars that is going to give you 90 hours of content to consume? (3 hours per day). For many of us it's going to be way more than 90. 
---
- Paying for classic wow is showing Blizzard that products like this have an audience. If you enjoy classic wow and you want Blizzard to go back to their roots and start making games like they used to there is no better way to show it than with your wallet.
---
There's going to be a friends and family beta before open beta. Until there is some rumor of that I'm staying low on hype.
---
To be fair I edited the tanking part in
---
Thank you for the answer and for this AMA, one of the most interesting ones ever. :)
---
Yeah we had NO protocol for what to do and the devs were just as confused as we were.  It truly was a figure it out as we go situation.  We we're not prepared! ;)
---
&gt; If I'm running a dungeon for a specific piece or two, I'm rolling on it.
---
And this should be communiticated clearly from the start when the item in question is an outlayer, or not your usual armor type/spec type.
---
I shouldn't join a group as the healing shaman then roll need on cloth mage armor without stating so before hand, just because I wanna min/max my elemental spec.
---
Is there any degree of this that anyone here agree with?
---
Depends on where you are. If you're on a boss in the back of the dungeon than usually a couple people taking turns trying cables is worth it. People can go do Bio Breaks during rezzes too.
---
I support this. Very much actually. I think it would be a mistake not to have at least just one RP-PVP per region.
---
Mage is definitely the go-to for mobility *and* damage, but Hunter ranks up there as well.
---
The Hunter requires you to master some very specific skillsets like kiting (surprising amount of people don't get it, but kiting is what made hunters able to kill almost any mob of any level with enough space) and correct use of traps and snares etc.
---
All in all I'd say Mage, Hunter, or Druid.
---
Thing to remember about Vanilla is it's entirely different from anything WotLK and onwards. Each class has fairly narrowly defined things they can and cannot do and you need to accept the limitations of your choices.   
---
The thing about mobility is it makes the game seem more "fair", when you lose or win you have a feeling that you did so on the merits of your own efforts.   
---
This is just not true in vanilla, like for instance if you're a shaman and a decent rogue blows some cooldowns you are just plain dead. If a hunter knows how to kite the warrior, too bad for the warrior. Etc.
---
Vanilla is just not fair, it was designed not to be fair, with a decently large scoop of "yeah we're just winging this, we are RTS experts not MMO experts."
---
Funny I remember being banned as a kid and when the Gm told me to find a safe spot to log out i said "You'll never take me alive" and next thing I know he said "Sorry I had to do this" and I was disconnected.
---
This is Baron Geddon's bomb.
---
Those are all Pservers, which have known bugs with Warriors, Rogues, and Mages. 
---
Charge on Warriors doesn't work right.
---
Rogues can Front Stab.
---
Mages have a huge boost to Frostbolt Damage.
---
Take any advice on this sub with a full shaker of salt. It's either people who haven't played Vanilla since it was out and have foggy memories (me), or people who play on Pservers and think that Classic is going to work exactly like a Pserver (the guy posting those videos).
---
Or you could just play coup, the shining stallion of a board game that never quits. Nice call on that one!
---
This was fixed in 1.5 or something pretty early on.  It's in patch notes, if you have the time to find it.
---
And my AXE..
---
I have quite a few friends that still work there.  I don't think any GM anymore though, most have moved on to other areas of the company more in line with their talents.  One of my friends who was on my team went to Austin during the split and was a Lead for awhile, not sure if they still are or aren't at this point though!  I should find out!
---
Thanks! I surely do appreciate that!  :)
---
GryphonHeart Items would let you create a book you can write in, but last I checked it hasn't been officially updated since WoD and was problematic. The second option I know of would be to use TRP3 Extended's (Which is going to have a Classic version I believe)  item creation to create a book to write in, but I haven't made much use of the item creation in that addon myself to say how straightforward or not that is.
---
Because I am arguing for fair loot distribution, in favor of a class I don't play?
---
I don't see how that makes me "stupid" or a "douche", let alone both.
---
The files are on there, but who’s to say that’s not just blizz trying to build hype? Is there a blue post confirming that there will be a closed beta, because I’ve been looking around and haven’t seen one. So far as I’ve seen they just found files.
---
I already know this guy is going to end up in one of my dungeon groups. Probably as a hunter. Needing on everything.
---
you really cant say it like that imo. are you talking about duels? bgs? something else? also, i feel like most classes skill cap is way too close with the exception of paladin (easier). 
---
its also heavily specc depended. shadowpriest=low skillcap, trispec priest in premade bgs on the other hand really high skillcap
---
Dang it. I've been struggling with this. I literally go back and forth from one week to another. PvP or PvE?
---
PvP Pros: Fun, exhilarating, element of danger, the thrill of the fight, sweet victory, making war buddies, server cohesion against a common enemy, amazing impromptu wpvp situations, stealing nodes from other faction,
---
PvP Cons: Corpse camping, High level gankers, flight master camping, griefers, unable to play, unable to quest, can't progress, precious game time gets taken over by unwanted PvP, certain zones at certain times literally unplayable due to no fault of your own, raids and dungeon runs being more difficult to get to w/o pvp disturbance and even canceled, 
---
PvE Pros: Quest undisturbed, No escort quest interruptions, level/grind undisturbed, fight when you want to, don't fight when you don't want to, won't get ganked, won't get camped, pretty much do exactly what you want when you want to, when you afk less likely to come back to a [6 Minutes to Release], actually make gold for your mount and raids, raids and dungeon runs travel is safer, 
---
PvE Cons: Get called a care bear, less likely to have  huge wpvp stuff, don't have notoriety of being on a PvP server, less likely to have cool wpvp stories to reminisce about later, 
---
I guess I'm back in the PvE camp this week. It doesn't sound too bad honestly. I rolled a PvP server in vanilla bc I wanted to be "cool", but honestly, I'd rather play the game than get some praise from a random online dude for being on a PvP server and spend tons of time struggling through it all. At the end of the day, it's about what you want and what your willing to put up with.
---
I would invest.
---
Much more explanation and argument than you provided. You can look into it as well, I gave you the exact server blade model they used, go see what it costed and that you can literally build a better PC for the much less than the blade costed, not even talking about infrastructure sale agreements with a company that would drive down price like they do in corporate server procurement.
---
There is currently 0 addons for classic wow so no.
---
If I were buying a gaming laptop the warranty would be one of my top priorities. Every single laptop and desktop I've ever owned has required someone to open it up to fix something at least once, and often a few times.
---
Username checks out
---
It's not constructive is all. Encourages people to respond in a non-constructive way too.
---
Im sure this guy is much more experienced than me but i think he is undervaluing wotf. he also talks favorably about beserking which has a significant cool down while criticizing undead racial for having long cool downs. Idk i found wotf way too useful to ignore
---
Try cirk's notebook, I believe it had a vanilla version
---
Geez, here come the edgelords...
---
And I wondered how gamers got their bad reputation..
---
Your the one who made the claim, the burden of proof is on you.
---
Yes!  We had to choose a name that wasn't selected by any character on any Realm in the game!  Once a GM name is taken, it's off all other realms  so they encouraged us to spell them a little funny, as to not take names away from players! ;)
---
Still better advice than bitching about pricing model for a game you want to play legitimately.
---
this is great
---
They have an awesome healing animation imo. I just love the human swing too much.
---
I played PvE in vanilla and on retail but have been hopping across different private servers for a few years, always choosing PvP servers. I wanted to see what I had missed out on and test my ability to play on PvP servers. 
---
I enjoy it, but when WoW Classic drops, I’ll be going PvE again. I’m older now, I’ll be wanting to play WoW when I get home from work. I won’t want the grieving/camping and corpse running that can come with some sessions on PvP servers. It happens rarely but my time will be limited, so why waste it. That’s just my take on it.
---
Yeah it is really a great deal
---
I can't remember for sure, but if I recall correctly you couldn't log out in that room.
---
Yes, Notre-Dame des attacked by a gigantic demon and a mage lit it on fire by mistake while trying to defend it.
---
&gt; I just also believe LC has no place AT ALL in a casual or even semi-serious guilds..
---
I agree. From my experience:   
---
casual raid guild: Just roll for it. Maybe some restrictions who can roll for what, 2nd need, loot strikes, etc.   
---
decent raid guild: dkp or rolling with certain loot (legendaries, BIS) going to the core group first.   
---
good raid guild: Council.   
---
top raid guild: No real system needed. People know who needs what the most and accept that.
---
No problem with ganking on a pvp server, go for it.
---
I hope you are like minded irl and not a retard sitting in the corner alone at lunch times and running home on fridays to play video games where you can be "the big boy".
---
Yeah but you don't have to. You setup a proxy  that uses the genuine cert and then use a self signed cert for data to the proxy, then you can snoop the data all you want.
---
You’re not worth any more time though
---
Fish inside WC imo. I farmed so much gold there.
---
ye except the problem is there is virtually no good mail or plate healing items in the game excluding tier sets
---
Looks like you can do it once per Paypal account.  I was able to do it twice using two different paypal accounts. So now I have $120 blizzard balance that cost me $80. Woot.
---
I would imagine any tanks/healers would be the most fun to watch.
---
Don't know what the current situation is on private servers, but in vanilla if it was a pug you'd probably get major grief from whoever you won the roll against.  As a paladin the only thing I could roll on in a pug which did not get me yelled at was plate/shield with caster stats.  Any other plate, or anything with +armor or +defense on it, if there was a warrior around they'd claim they deserved it more cause paladins just healed in raids (even on runs I tanked and a warrior DPS'd).  Any trinkets/rings/weapons with +damage then warlocks/mages would claim priority.  Even healing cloth or leather would often result in priests or druids claiming priority because Paladins could also use plate or mail gear and they couldn't.  
---
Example that stands out the most in my mind was a Gnomeregon run.  I was the only healer on it, we clear the whole thing, last boss drops the radio dish cloth hat.  I greed it.  Everyone else greeds it as well.  I win the roll.  A mage who was along just explodes and spends like 10-15 minutes spamming me with whispers about how I'm a terrible person because Paladins can wear mail and soon plate so I had no business rolling on cloth.   I ask him why he didn't just need it if he wanted it so badly and he just keeps going on about how Paladins should not roll on cloth and I should feel bad and deserved to get blacklisted.
---
Thank you for info, got my 6 month sub code sent to my email to await the classic release.
---
*Yawn*
---
Probably can get a lot of time out of a rogue in world pvp.
---
You and the Rogue would make it a priority not to run in groups with other competing characters honestly.
---
We're here debating different armor wearing classes competing for the same items, but you phrase the priority as if you were both Rogues(or the same class). And much like my vanilla days, I wouldn't often run in groups with a player that competed for the 1 item I'm after, I would just find another group where that's not the case.
---
&gt; That what I meant - people that want to play Classic will play it and 8.2 will be inferior.
---
But without 8.2 people who dont care much about Classic will try it out. Thats the point. The people who want to play Classic will play it regardless, no matter what. The tourists wont.
---
There's no way it's still in alpha,they've been developing this game since Q4 or even Q3 2017 and it's not even a new game.
---
Its not the players fault that his best items are leather. You shouldnt get tge best item just cause you cant wear the shittier plate/mail options. For all of raiding, warrior tier sets are tanking pieces. Rogues get a full leather dps set at every raid tier. Get woke and stop feeling like its so unfair to you.
---
It's a 5 minute cooldown afaik
---
[For all the mobile users](https://us.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html)
---
i can confirm that it's only once per paypal account. so just switch to a new paypal account and you can do it multiple times.
---
Don't forget Usher. He dominated the Billboard charts in 2004.
---
Fuck! I'm looking so much forward to this. So tired of achievements etc. and all RPG elements being gone from my MMOs. I probably will have to wait until Autumn to get serious with Vanilla, since summer is to be enjoyed.
---
Haha oh man! I would love to see that to know the context.
---
My best guess is they had a lead there keeping an area clear for some reason, but I suppose it's possible that some GM decided to go rogue that day! ;)
---
For the most part we were.  Whatever we needed to be able to help a player we had.  The main thing I would say that was different than player perception is 99% of the time we were helping players and mostly didn't use any of that stuff unless necessary.
---
This reality has surpassed my mildest expectation. It's almost at "spicy"
---
I'm not even part of #nochanges (didn't actually start til TBC, so I have no real opinion either way), and I will be playing to early 2000's music. Can't forget the EDM though! Cascada, ATB, Benassi, Darude, etc.
---
The most pro warrior I ever met used to taunt hunter pets so they attack him and break freezing trap.
---
I have said this story many times on this forum but it’s probably the most pro move I have ever seen on warrior.
---
I just wish there was a version of wpvp where you got actually fair fights. Levelling on a pserv recently, I've only ever been attacked by people 8+ levels above me, if not 20 levels above me.
---
I don't really mind being attacked when I'm fighting a mob or low Mana/hp, but it's just not fun when it's some 50-60 rogue jumping around killing all the lowbies, and then just leaving whenever my factions 60s show up. I think I've probably been killed 50+ times by opposite faction members, and not a single one was within 4 levels. They're just running around zones way too low for them.
---
pre-PW:S the charge, so the white hit gets absorbed, early fears, put them in-combat before they charge with a dot, making sure to face them if you wear a shield so you can attempt to block snares, run through them to break swing timers.
---
map the 2 trackings to mousewheel up / down and flip between the two all the time. Win.
---
Wish I’d have been here when it was first posted - I’d have posted some meme with Justin Timberlake and “it’s gonna be May”
---
Missed opportunity
---
Hunters require agi.
---
There are some items that are clearly rogue drops, so it's a little nuanced. 
---
But, in general during a pick up group it's fair game to need Agi.
---
During an actual raid, if you've earned the DKP why not.
---
I guess hacking is more of a general term to me then. Not sure why that doesn't qualify. They're faking a client to trick blizzard into thinking it's real? Not sure why we can't call that hacking haha
---
why do some people claim its a alpha when the screenshot clearly says beta?
---
You really believe that Blizz put obscure data files on their CDN for someone to digg up and then hopefully blast out to whoever their audience is and then hope they also blast it out to their own respective influence networks are to build hype?? That's not how a company does business if the goal is to build hype. 
---
If that was the goal, they would put out a straight forward post that they can control from their own curated social platforms to build hype.
---
Thank you. Your service is greatly appreciated.
---
On another note. I LIKE SWORDS. SWORD-CHUCKS.
---
TL;DR: Play what you want, have fun. WoW isn't going anywhere.
---
Even though I'm older and have **significantly** less time to play, I will still be rolling on a PvP server because I love testing gear, skill, and wits in combat against members of the opposing faction.
---
As Horde, I felt charged to hunt down all the Alliance scum that had spawn camped me and slaughtered my quest givers for the first 59 levels. Did I grief a few people? Sure. Did I get griefed a few times? You bet. But in the end, do I think everyone had fun? I do. Because even though we know the risks, we accept that as the price of playing on a ruthless server where you may have to fight for your life at any moment. That's what really makes the game for me and I will continue to play on PvP servers.
---
If I get griefed, I'll hop onto an alt and level that, make some money, craft some stuff, go to a different zone, chat with my guild. Hell, maybe I'll incite a raid to counter the griefers. There are plenty of options to deal with it, you just need the right mindset and enjoying the game, knowingly accepting that some people will always be griefers.
---
“Overwriting their vanilla memories with pserver bugs” is a brilliant articulation of the concept.
---
it's not unfair to me, I don't even play rogue. This issue can occur in numerous similar scenario among many different classes. I'm here attempting to debate where unspoken priority should lie.
---
The best resolution is for everyone to communicate upfront what they're after and be sure there is no competition or find another group.
---
It feel really bad if our groups shaman healer rolled on some mage gear because he wanted to min/max his elemental spec without saying anything ahead of time, wouldn't you agree with that? Can we draw the line somewhere? Or is it fair that a paladin/hunter can just need everything?
---
Haha!  I am glad they were able to restore everything!  My best guess is that the item shows up in the logs as unselected, so when it got restored it didn't have the data of your selections.  There were definitely a couple quirky items like this in the database!
---
Daft Punk is playing at my house

my house
---
I can confirm that you can do this deal multiple times as long as you use a new paypal account for each transaction. I was able purchase $60 of Blizzard balance using one paypal account that had the offer linked. Then I removed that Paypal account from my Blizz settings. Then I added another Paypal account that had the offer linked, and was able to purchase it again. So I now have $120 Blizz balance that cost $80.
---
as hard as pos-sib-le
---
I agree. It seems very out of sorts that it would still be in alpha. Here’s to hoping
---
&gt;min maxing
---
&gt;not equipping what looks the best and using raw skill to compensate
---
Psh looks like some of you need to re read the light and how to swing it
---
Yeah. But the emphasis is on the "because the enemy is incompetent". Most of the time your strategy will give the enemy the opportunity to counter you. The difference between a good and a bad strategy is how likely that is, how likely you would be able to counter his counter etc. If your whole strategy resolves around an enemy not knowing how to use one of his most important abilities and you dont really have a backup plan... I would call that a shit strategy. Feel free to disgaree. But if you feel the need of telling me that you disagree, please try to address my point this time.
---
I guess that depend on which version, I had plenty of healing mail items for my shamy pre-raid
---
In terms of **solo** play:
---
  **High Skill Cap:** Rogues, Mages
---
  **Mid Skill Cap:** Warlocks, Hunters
---
  **Low Skill Cap:** Priests, Warriors, Druids, Paladins, Shamans
---
All 8.1.5 did was add Allied races that should of been at the start of BFA, no one was saying that 8.1.5 was a big patch.
---
8.2 on the other hand is adding two new zones, new raid, mega dungeon, changes to the azerite system, mount equipment, etc. Not saying it'll be good or bad, just saying it'll be a big patch. The biggest by far for BFA.
---
this is a really great idea - i think ill try it on my priest when classic comes out
---
Except on Kazzak, healing drake, or any other boss/ creeps with healing mechanics.
---
So I will likely be playing Alliance if I go priest at the end of all this, but it's good to know that in part at least, my worries are not to be worried about! - I hope that there is alot of PvP content coming out in classic and not just the  4 classes that we see from MonkeyNews, Perplexity and StormX and Ebn
---
Right click on the buff...
---
No no, much worse than that.
---
stuff like physical threats or sexual violence towards kids.
---
People literally were saying 8.1.5 was make or break, then it came up on the PTR and it changed to 8.2.
---
If you had a full understand of what it's like to be one of the many people that make 10 dollars an hour and are living paycheck to paycheck, you would understand how patently absurd the idea of risking your job for the sake of grinding some gold or xp in a video game is.
---
&gt; Numerous ways to get around being caught.
---
You are exactly the kind of person that would be in for a rude awakening if you lost your safety net, and is never going to progress in your career. Responsible adults realize that putting some effort into your job has long term benefits. Cheating the system will certainly eventually bite you in the ass. 
---
&gt; Sorry if my language deeply offended
---
Yea, I'm not offended in the slightest. 
---
&gt; and made you feel like you had to educate me on bills/maintaining your job.
---
It's obvious that you have a safety net to fall on when you inevitably fail. For many of us, failure means your family ends up on the street. So go ahead and screw off on your job all want. Judging by the amount of people that downvoted you it seems there are way more people that actually have something to lose and wouldn't risk their job for some extra farming time on wow.
---
I agree with you but I'm just trying to live like maybe it's the very end of summer.
---
They've had since at least 2004 to put Naga in the game and the Heavy Falcon rocket completed a mission this morning so anythings possible between those extremes of disappointment and amazing.
---
I think we'll get it before end of summer but I'm just prepping myself like we'll get it in the last week.
---
Im rolling pve. I used to like pvp and playing against other people, but now i have serious problems with stress (both easily stressed and getting very stressed instantly) to the point that I have to take a break when i get frustrated.
---
Also, i can play in peace and not have to worry about being corpsecamped.
---
Rolling on off spec gear against main specs like dps gear when you are healing is unacceptable. But that is completely different than rolling on your leather BiS as a warrior, or rolling on cloth BiS as paladin.
---
Nah. If theres a Rogue in the group, just ask.
---
problem solved
---
I can give you my job (if you have a master of law)  and my gf. I won’t need them till I’ll be ganking all day long.
---
Yes, waiting for your cooldowns so you stand a chance against half of the classes. Very engaging to watch.
---
Well Shadow is really fun but those 1v1 moments that get drawn out across the world kill me when I go Oom on mana! However it would be a nice side spec to play! - Saying that the Trispec that is thrown around is actually quite fun, and the imp scream means you can out trade a warriors z.rage
---
Yeah I agree with the melee animation, but dwarf healing looks better. Hard choice.
---
That's actually a pretty good idea
---
That's inaccurate, active pservers are censored here, old pservers that have since been shut down (like Nost) are not.
---
Fine with me I love the fury playstyle, throw me some tanking pieces when the MT/OT already have them and I'd be glad to sub in
---
Oh please. You're still on the server causing stress and interacting with others, enriching their gameplay and allowing the game as a whole to function. It doesn't really matter if you're actively trying to break the game or submitting bug reports.
---
The deal works on anything in the Blizz shop. So, you can just buy $60 Blizz credit, and it will apply the $20 off. And when classic releases, you can use it for the sub cost.
---
You would be surprised seeing me irl ;)
---
Medivh had nothing to do with corrupting the orcs, he merely opened the Dark Portal on the side of Azeroth. So yes, he was a traitor, and he was killed for being a traitor during the First War, what’s your point? The orcs were corrupted by Gul’dan and by their own lust for power leading them to drink the blood of Mannoroth. Gul’dan had already formed the horde and the Shadow Council by the time Medivh contacted him.
---
Granted most of the rank and file orcs were tricked into drinking the blood, but that doesn’t change how it looks from the human’s side, which is a bunch of demon crazed savages invading your world and butchering your people. Again, given the orcs’ history up to that point, the fact that the Alliance didn’t just kill them on sight as they do with actual demons says a lot.
---
I gave one example of how to counter being jumped, that is to go through a mental check list given your options.
---
Fear. Run. They broke it?
---
Shield. Mind control for kick. If kicked.
---
Heal through dps, walking towards friendly.
---
If nothing has worked till then, repeat with mind blast/control to eat kicks. (Kickbot is rampant on pservers, classic it wasn't a huge problem.)
---
One greater heal, with 70% cast through hits and damage reduction from crits (30%?) You should survive if you're geared towards more stamina for your braindead team to waddle yo you and get you out of it. 
---
This alone doesnt include major healing potion, limited inulneravility potion, or free action potion.
---
That's not what i was seeing, and those who were saying that were silly to begin with. Again, all it added was allied races, which should of been in the game 6 months ago. Other than that, there was no changes to anything. Just some more races to play in a shit state of a game.
---
Can’t unsee THAT now, thankyouverymuch
---
Goons are from EVE right?
---
I mean if your on a PvP server it's a given that you've accepted the risk. If a 60 ganks you just get help
---
The way my buddy would say it would bring me to tears.
---
There was so much angst and anxiety in his voice with a total off the handle screams for the caps.  
---
Good times! :)
---
To me retailers is the people who keep playing on official servers. I stopped at Cata.
---
You have to remember, people were still hoping for a full on Rework of some classes. It wasn't till Blizzard flat out stated that wasn't happening this expansion that I started hearing hype of 8.1.5 almost completely die off.
---
A REALLY good Druid would be fascinating but Sodapoppin already has that audience for twitch, just wait till he starts streaming classic 😂 (good duels soda m8 😉)
---
Mages are fantastic but everyone plays them, however if you know how to play one like no one else with special tricks and godly 1vX’s then it’s entertaining. OG_Haptix/Ohhgee takes the cake on that one imo. ohhgee PvP movie: https://youtu.be/mRWwcyx3m1k
---
Warlock is fascinating if someone’s really really good. 
---
Goth is a GODLY warlock his PvP movies are fascinating. 
---
One of Goth’s early PvP movies: https://youtu.be/VRS8dRDW7wg
---
That's why they said world PvP. There's more downtime in wpvp compared to instanced PvP.
---
Lots of streamers will probably do that and it'll still be pretty popular. It's unique gameplay
---
Wow and we never fucking saw it bs
---
I almost never get attacked when I'm just traveling around or not doing anything, unless it's someone 10+ levels higher than me.
---
World PvP only happens when one player has a clear advantage over the other. Fair fights are almost nonexistent.
---
You actually get more for your money now when you factor in inflation.  Quite a bit more, really.
---
15/month is worth substantially less now than it was in 2004.
---
Giant tits
---
Depends, 8.2 isn't going anywhere soon, while Classic will be in all WoW media. And even if they try a week after launch they will still be in a wave of players. IMHO forcing players to choose isn't the nicest thing to do.
---
Ooo thank you. What do you think about a priest?
---
Since you are unemployed living in your moms basement, you are technically correct
---
After leveling 2 characters per faction, I believe you probably will have seen most of the content available (short of niche class quests which are not plentiful).  You can get away with skipping certain zones,  but that may be at the expense of some grinding XP to make up for missing the quests.  
---
The zones you skip are the ones you'll want to hit on the next character - but honestly that's going to be about it as far as variety goes.  Of course there will always be quests you didn't do because you were ready to leave a zone, and couldnt find mankriks wife.  But by the time you hit 60 twice, you will have pretty much seen what's out there.  
---
There's a lot of max level content, but virtually none of it is class specific.
---
Yea they're just using specifically made programs to obtain files they aren't supposed to get yet in ways that trick the system into giving them files but it's totally not hacking in any way shape or form...

---
So in other words, people didn't know what 8.1.5 was adding/changing. That for the most part, isn't really the case with 8.2 though.
---
Nice, by buddy got that for me for my birthday like 5 or 6 years ago. It's my favorite version of monopoly with the exception of Pokemon monopoly. The rules in that one were legit.
---
I came to this conclusion as well. Just the fear of being attacked/ganked at any moment brings a lot of excitement to the game. 
---
Those times where you see an opposing faction guy doing the same quest and you have to decide if it's worth starting shit or risk being shit on. Taking the back paths instead of the main roads, avoiding encounters you know you'll lose, it makes things interesting.
---
Now that I'm older I don't have to be too emotionally invested in what happens to my character. If someone wants to gank/corpse camp me I can just logoff and do something else. Sometimes getting camped provides a healthy incentive to take a break.
---
Haha nothing special.  It looked very windows 3.1 ;)
---
It is actually, they're tricking a system into getting access to something that the system hasn't given anyone access to yet.
---
Game end
---
Friends and Family Alpha here I come!
---
Shadow priests are filthy 1v1.
---
And now that you mention it, that would be a smart move actually. You’d have to be good enough at priest to be the shadowPriest that is skilled enough to be the raids shadowPriest because a good raid only uses 1 sPriest and that’s it, all others end up healing. So a streamer perspective of a shadowPriest is fairly unique as a shadowPriest is rare-ish(respeccing rich kids)
---
still it says that I do not have the permission to use the offer.
---
And, that it is available only within XX states of America, and purchases must be in USD. European servers don't accept USD anyway.
---
So, in short, you're nothing more but spammer. You don't have gold yet, so you found something else to spam?
---
5 minutes with no pvp action will drop your flag. Mind you it needs to be toggled off for the timer to start.
---
Yes, but if it doesn't bring enough people back we will more than likely hear talk of 8.2.5 or 8.3 be make it or break it.
---
Hell Ive already seen people saying the next expansion will make or break WoW.
---
Lol I haven’t seen that guy in years.
---
Or the server side Beta product will be used as the initial alpha then rolled straight into a beta, just like BFA and Legion.
---
lmao can you fools relax? blizzard hasnt said anything about the beta yet. yall are just drawing conclusions from incomplete information
---
Not anymore.  I left to start my own business coaching Ice Skating and I still do that (among other things) I work out of several different rinks in my area and online too.
---
They still haven't sent my my \~\~beta\~\~ alpha invite.
---
Perfect, my finals end next Tuesday! If it launched today I would fail all my finals...
---
Yeah, seriously. Druid requires a million IQ to play to its full extent in PvP. Way more than hunter IMO.
---
Also yeah why is Warlock up so high? Warlock PvP is fairly simple and straight forward.
---
Thanks for the response. Can't wait for a release date!
---
D R U I D
---
Museums or mausoleums?  Active community is the lifeblood of a server. What use is there for a server where no one logs on?
---
Post Naxx is a riddle for which I'm not sure an answer exists. I commend you for trying though.
---
Back then they were exclusive spells.  They will be again.  You can only track one thing.
---
I’m expecting a release date and beta date/news this weekend or next weekend, 
---
Fingers crossed for tomorrow
---
what ? bis is bis, its not based on armor. if you have a hard time with this, i suggest you roll cloth dps. Because even paladin/shamans will take cloth gear.
---
Hell yeah! I remember Subx, rogue if I recall? Could be way wrong on that. 
---
I would *love* to see those videos.  I don't think I was there yet; I think I was still in my previous guild, Legion of Darkness (LoD) when FC downed Rag/Razor/Vael, as I joined FC when we were pushing Chromaggus.  I'd love to watch in any case just for nostalgia and the names. DM me!
---
Would love if FC re-made, but I'm also okay with a totally fresh experience this time around.  Who knows!
---
Yes.  Retail game time will be the only option.  $15 is cheap.
---
This will be me :)
---
reading further down in the comments, they actually scan your specs VIA battle.net :)
---
Are you stupid or something? Who needs words from employees when you have the factual info right there in front of you.
---
As BFA beta had two servers, it wouldn’t surprise me to see one server of each type for the beta (RPPVE, PVE, PVP). It would also be great if they surprised us with RPPVP :)
---
Well the fresh servers are where the majority of the players would be in this analogy.
---
Everquest runs a lot like this except it is expacs not patches.
---
Moving your character back to your home realm would encourage some to keep playing their old chars especially if they didn’t finish their objectives before the patch realm closes.
---
Every time I see full judgement
---
&gt;if u don't have the latest xpac u can't do any of the content that everybody and all your friends are playing right now.
---
And that's true whether you pay for Classic or not.
---
Anger without vengeance is fruitless. The fruit of vengeance is sweet. I welcome any who would spread the seeds of anger. I want to taste that fruit again.
---
If you are not able to properly cultivate your anger and let it act as the driving force for vengeance then you don't belong on a PvP server.
---
So if your leveling your little Paladin or Shaman and an opposing Warrior grief's the fuck out of you, are you the kind of person to get distressed or are you the kind of person who can turn fear I to excitement and anger into purpose?
---
It's okay if your not. It is pretty after all. Petri was is the only motivator I've found that keeps me from drowning in fear. If I wasn't trying to run my father's nose in it for example Imever would have had the courage to go throw the basic training.
---
omega a lmao what that guy said
---
I played hunter in retail vanilla on alliance and there was a high demand- the top guilds on my server were constantly recruiting hunters and warlocks, I imagine this is a different experience on private servers today.
---
Oceanic uses the US build...
---
Start with classic. The feeling of wonder, expanse and exploration is so much more epic than a free boost to 110.
---
Buy 1 month of game time from the Blizzard online Store and add it to your [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) account, install the [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) Installer, select World of Warcraft: Classic, click Install.
---
Thats a valid point. I only ever levelled a warrior in WotLK and I had a main feeding gold for constant gear upgrades, so it wasn’t quite as bad.
---
how do i see the results ?
---
That's a hard pass for me if that's the case, I'll never play on 200 ping again.
---
I didn't look at the minimap anyway. It's quite useless without flying.
---
Nothing. You'll just have to pay the subscription.
---
Bonus: you'll get all the expansions up to Legion for free by doing so.
---
Them wild growth spaulders
---
PVP server is just too much of a crapshoot. If you roll on a pvp server and get the low pop faction like you said you might as well reroll on a new server. And you might not even know how bad it is until you're days or weeks into leveling. There's also the fact that while the constant threat of attack is actually pretty damn cool while leveling, it's a pain the the fucking ass when all you want to do after work is farm some herbs for your raid but some rogue is ganking you. Basically both types of servers are great when they're great, and bad when they're bad. I played on a pve server and being able to just do my own thing whenever I wanted was awesome. However it kind of sucked playing a class/spec that was actually excellent at pvp but only being able to kill people in battlegrounds.
---
The AUS national past time is crying.
---
It's weird cause your level icon in your portrait changes to the swords like your in combat but your actually not, a leftover mechanic from the 1.10 change
---
And BiS might be BiS for the rogue as well.
---
So one player gets BiS and the other gets an upgrade, vs. one player gets BiS and the other gets vendor trash?  (Or, one player gets BiS and another upgrade, and the other player gets nothing).  Which is more fair?
---
I'm working on figuring that out immediately !
---
Shaman would be cool, but Shadowmeld for life.
---
&gt; have any of you seen any information about this?
---
Yes. On the demo, it was not possible to track by clicking the minimap button and ticking check marks. You had to use the spell in your spellbook like in vanilla. And, while there was nobody with both herbalism and mining, here is how did the spell description look like:
---
 [http://www.thottbot.com/spell=2383](http://www.thottbot.com/spell=2383)
---
Honestly at this point there are classes even more mobile than DH, I play rogue but I can't stick to mages or locks for some fucking reason (mages get like 5 fucking blinks) but if a DH tries to escape me I can keep up with them (until they jump into the fucking air and blast me for 80% of my hp ignoring LoS and stealth and with no way to hit them back). BFA sucks and I can't wait for Classic.
---
I don't think so to be honest, if 8.2 doesn't bring enough to the table, then i think people will lose interest all together with BFA and they'll either wait till the next expansion or move on to Classic/quit.
---
And until there's some big changes to class design and RNG loot system, people will continue to leave. You have warforging, titanforging, chance to proc sockets on gear, lack of vendors (especially for pvp) All these systems make the game feel less rewarding then it use to and make you feel the need to continue to play. 
---
Combo that with no tier sets, a downgraded artifact system and lack of abilities and you have yourself a shit expansion.
---
I have a feeling it'll take them multiple expansions to fix the hole they dug themselves into and that's being generous because they most likely won't.
---
Hunters and Mages own in PvP in classic. Hunter will probably be more fun though. Mage is very cookie cutter.
---
Sounds like something straight out of the Dresden Files.
---
Same. Always been PVP but I never grief low-level players so I don't want to be griefed.
---
Nothing I like better than indulging in PVE and farming/killing/looting.
---
Don't you americans cry if you get higher than 40 ping lmao
---
&gt; Maybe it's just because I'm much older now and just want to enjoy the game itself and not the world pvp aspect as much anymore.
---
Most of us are converts that are just older now. I would wager a great percentage of us were on PVP servers too at one point. These days I have a clear goal in mind that I want to achieve in game everytime I get a LITTLE free time to play. I don't have the disposable time to have that goal thwarted by skirmishing with ?? level hunters and rogues.
---
Maybe back in the day, but not now. So I do PVE, and I enjoy questing for the lore, afking to referee the kids in the front room and coming back to a very much **ALIVE** character even in the middle of STV, heh.
---
I'd love being on a PvP server **if** there was dishonor points with the criteria being different from what Blizzard had already tried. In a nutshell, initiating an attack on a grey level player (worth no honor points) will result in dishonor if the attack happens in a contested zone. This would allow people to engage in raiding enemy faction racial leaders without having to worry about lowbies flagging themselves for PvP and jumping into the AoE to give the raiders dishonor. But it would also discourage ganking lowbies out the world. The way I figure it, in your own territory, even on a PvP server, you have to explicitly flag yourself for PvP to be attacked. So if you are attacked and killed, that's on you. Additionally, you don't have a need to quest in enemy territory, so once again, if you're attacked and killed there, it's on you. But in the contested zones, you need to go there and quest/grind to level up. And if a skull level enemy players ganks you for no benefit to themselves and no ability for you to defend yourself, that's just annoying and bad design.
---
*Nice*
---
That actually sounds extremely strong—kiting mobs with hamstring and a fatty warrior smashing them down.  I think this is what I am leaning more towards.
---
&gt; How does world pvp work on PVE servers? I’ve always played on PVP, and also consider PVE server this time around
---
Everyone becomes a rogue. Everyone, Just one you can see and wonder if it's going to happen or not. Rogues become double-rogues. because now when they stealth you don't know if they'll hit you or not.
---
fresh servers instantly kill old servers
---
They cry over everything
---
Well no shit... it has beta servers.
---
&gt;there’s absolute no way we’re getting a July release. Super disappointing
---
GLOOM AND DOOM
---
Here you go!  
---
[https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-H783BZF3V/](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-H783BZF3V/)
---
I'm with you, man.
---
I level to 60 and get ganked all along the way while minding my own fucking business.
---
Then I get to 60 and don't waste any time ganking low-level players. So I'll definitely go PVE this time around.
---
PVP is essentially ganking. If I want to PVP, I'll go into battlegrounds where the fights are honorable and the rewards worthwhile.
---
I recommend darkshore if possible but I can see the run being annoying, I feel like most people trying out classic will head to Westfall as it's what they are used to in retail, but so much more exp is available in darkshore.
---
Well, maybe if you interchange Druids and Hunters that list would be pretty accurate. Hunters have so many PvP tools in Vanilla it's simply unfair. Ranged/Melee slows, trap CC, scatter, a passive mana drain, a ranged stun in BM, powerful roots in Survival, kitting ability, longer range than other classes ... You have so much room for error in PvP because of these it's uncredible, and makes the class quite easy. I have had my share of Vanilla Hunt PvP, and they're one of the easiest classes rather than one of the hardest. 
---
Outside of Mages and Melees Dead Zone isn't even an issue. It's way harder to deal with dead zone as a Warrior than as a Hunter. Kitting is hardly difficult against other classes than these two, and just consists in strafing, looking at Yaht to get some auto shots, and using Multishot when it's up (with some Serpent/arcane shots in the middle).
---
Druids are the opposite. Any mistake when polymorphing and you're dead if you don't have NS - else it's two mistakes. And mana management with Shapeshifting is just horrible Rogues without CDs too are super fragile. Warlocks are OP but legit hard in group PvP because of the ammount of stuff you can and should do, and so are mages. Paladins/Shamans/Priests are easier because they lack CC/CS/ Class specific abilities that would make their gameplay harder, even though I believe Totem management and using R1 frost shock / Earth shock would make Shamans go up significantly in the ranking though.
---
I wont wear that damn baron dress ,even if it has +10 healing over what I have. Nope.
---
Where I live 15$ a month
---
Minimum wage was 6$. 
---
It's now 15$ a month and minimum wage is 14$.
---
Looks to be discounted.
---
Locks also have a moderately high skill *floor.* That is to say, it's easy to get decent results just standing back dotting everything, but that's not taking advantage of all the other things they bring to the table.
---
Undead rogue.
---
Actually, SWPrison refers to a scrapped instance called the Stormwind Vault.
---
You can look it up on YouTube, it features many rooms sized for raid boss encounters and is quite a bit larger than the Stockades dungeon.
---
Such a great combo
---
World PVP is critical to the vanilla experience in my opinion. But to each their own.
---
Don't forget to get your [Light of Elune](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5816/light-of-elune) so you can NEVER USE IT EVER, just in case.
---
Warrior + balance druid.
---
Can we just get a megathread? Every third thread is about what happens after naxx
---
No. On a PvE server, everyone is NOT yellow. The yellow players are the ones that have flagged themselves for PvP. They're yellow since they can't attack you (even though they're flagged), but if you attack them, then you too will be flagged for PvP and become fair game for them to attack back in return. The PvP flagged players will turn red if you're also PvP flagged. If you're not PvP flagged, they'll be yellow.
---
Because the mods don't make sense
---
Wouldn't you?
---
&gt; Leather is main spec gear for Warriors sometimes.
---
As for the Truestrike Shoulders example, these are BiS for DPS warriors. So what if the warrior is tanking the instance but is still main spec DPS? See how this can sorta compare to the healing shaman taking the mage gear? 
---
So if either main spec is running the instance as there off-spec, where does the line fall? You could see how this may be confusing if not communicated upfront because others in the group may think those off-spec players are using their main spec in the instance but when the loot drops, their in for a surprise. 
---
And this doesn't mention the monopoly that both those off-spec guys will have on Tanking/Healing gear, since those roles are usually only filled by one person and that gear is still there off-spec gear. Can you see the huge disadvantage that the DPS classes would face in this scenario?
---
This is a misnomer.
---
Tips isn't actually reading the regions for the game, he's reading the game builds.
---
US is the build the Oceanic servers will use.  The realm list will be delivered, not packaged.
---
Well, maybe if you interchange Druids and Hunters that list would be pretty accurate. Hunters have so many PvP tools in Vanilla it's simply unfair. Ranged/Melee slows, trap CC, scatter, a passive mana drain, a ranged stun in BM, powerful roots in Survival, kitting ability, longer range than other classes ...

---
I wouldn't take alpha and beta categorizations too seriously, they're really nebulous terms that differ from studio to studio, and even project to project. For example, the WoD Alpha was public when in the past there had never been a WoW xpac alpha that didn't have an NDA.
---
Classic also doesn't suffer from the trappings of having to redesign whole gameplay concepts from the ground up, they already have the info they're just making sure it all lines up. The type of alpha that Classic could have and the length of it, could be dramatically different for those reasons.
---
It’s true. I logged in on the free to play weekend and was surprised that the barrens mobs were level 40. 
---
Also paladin spells don’t cost mana, at least they didn’t at level 40. I had a paladin I never really bothered to level so I was using that, and decided to tank a dungeon. I’ve never tabked before. But it’s so easy since there’s only like five buttons now anyways and you can just spam consecration endlessly since it doesn’t cost mana, and you pretty much can’t die. Eventually I was pulling every mob I could to see when it would be too many, but we literally never died. It was nuts and super boring.
---
There’s a quest in Thunderbluff, where the quest giver says he hates undead. Sure enough, Undead cannot do the quest. That’s the only race specific one I know of.
---
On
---
&gt;he merely opened the Dark Portal on the side of Azeroth
---
Yeah, *merely* let them straight in. The orcs were *merely* corrupted. Once they found out they were being enslaved, not empowered, they turned on the Legion.
---
&gt;  The orcs were corrupted by ~~Gul’dan~~ The Legion.
---
Mannoroth gave them the blood at the direction of Kil'Jaeden. Gul'dan was just another pawn. Same as Medivh, admittedly. The way you say it makes it seem like Gul'dan sought out the Legion, killed/enslaved Mannoroth, and took the blood, and the other Orcs were asking him to do it the whole time. 
---
&gt; their own lust for power leading them to drink the blood of Mannoroth
---
They only thought they needed power to protect themselves from the Draeni (invaders from another world from the Orc's perspective). 
---
All that aside, the Burning Legion only knew of Azeroth thanks to the Night Elves. Another member of the Alliance. The Night Elves caused the Sundering, which destroyed most of the land on Azeroth, and created the Maelstrom.
---
You've got a naive perception of how markets work. Corporate price determination is a largely amoral process, concerned 99% with value and mayyybe a tiny bit with customer perception. It also has little to do with how much the product cost *them* to produce.
---
They will charge what their customers think the product is worth. They've correctly deduced that we are willing to pay $15 a month.
---
oh right :O i dont know why but i thought GMs weren't allowed to play the game
---
I remember using 1024\*768 or something similar for a pretty long time. My first lcd monitor wasn't even 1080p it was 1650x1050.
---
Still no leeks ?
---
Actually, it's for the scrapped Stormwind Vault dungeon/raid.
---
(confused in PvE)
---
&gt;  I think the less greedy option for Blizzard is to do like a variable sub (classic or retail+classic)
---
...You do realize if they did something like that, it'd be something like $15 for retail, $10 for Classic or $20 Retail+Classic, right? They sure as hell aren't lowering the cost of retail itself just so a package deal of Retail+Classic would still be $15 like it is going to be now.
---
Except that raids require 40 people so unfinished content will remain unfinished unless the server is booming with activity. Smaller things like quests and rep grinds won't be useful other than for a completionist sake and the market for that is very small, especially in a version of wow that was before achievement lists.
---
I honestly prefer the fork of TBC or vanilla reset mostly because I enjoyed TBC a lot. But I concede that such a split may fracture the player base too much to keep a critical mass of players in either fork. It also puts blizzard in the uncomfortable position of where to stop nostalgia servers. Which leaves us with vanilla resets. Even that has the potential for diminishing returns over time. How many times do people want to grind to 60 and get attuned for raids?
---
I think my go to will be “what race can play paladin as Horde?”
---
You just have to pay the monthly subscription. No CD-keys or wathever needed.
---
Now imagine the same outfit on a male troll and you've got the shamans on horde.
---
Install the game first, THEN buy 1 month
---
Druid.. be a 1v1 Monster Carry that Flag in PVP and then do whatever i please Tank/dps/heal until i get stuck in resto on raids. (which is fine by me) i heal in retail as a druid
---
I don't think that would indicate a good vs a bad beta tester.
---
Well you rez the other classes that can rez first, so it’s not so bad.
---
Well we agree on 1 thing at least
---
Is this the same patch that added debris pools? Thx.
---
I have played on a few private servers and have good bouts from time to time with the enemy faction, but it is more often than not a shitfest.
---
Wrong
---
Couldnt have put it better myself. Newer players will typically end up in the first two categories and I'd just hate to see a new player get taken advantage of because of a lack of knowledge. But then again that is true vanilla lol
---
That's going to be my choice too. Druids are complex and fun - It's too bad they were regarded so poorly in Vanilla
---
Wait. I can play halo on PC right now? I’m an idiot
---
gross
---
This isn't modern wow.
---
If you see an orc and you figure out how to say 'ANAL' to him, Blizzard probably won't care. 
---
If you figure out a way to give them a discord invite via /say you are going to find yourself banned pretty quickly.
---
[https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5LMvrrHMgKicNE7S/giphy.gif](Everyone's a winner!)
---
:(
---
My point being that Im not sure they will give a shit. If the vanilla exploit is in or a new one shows up they may just leave it in.
---
You can open bnet without WINE, then as long as it is running you can launch the game itself directly with WINE.
---
I just can't decide! I'll probably do exactly what I did back in OG Vanilla and make 5+ different characters and get nowhere for a month before I finally make my decision. For now I'm set on Undead Warlock... or Troll Priest... or a Warrior... fuck...
---
Yes. You could go explore them on sandbox/private servers.
---
Law entails more hours for less pay so I'll pass. I'd need to see pictures of the gf to be sure, but probably not.
---
Not yet, but the Master Chief Collection is coming to Steam this year.
---
[speaking to college kids in weed legal state]
---
Drugs is all around you kids. Look at that MMO game login. What the hell you think that is, some kind of game? Log in, play it, and get high.
---
Hmm...This might be exactly what im looking for. Better write it down somewhere.
---
&gt; Hunters have so many PvP tools in Vanilla it's simply unfair.
---
It doesn't mean they don't have a huge skill cap tho. Being OP/Crappy and having high/low skill cap are not directly related.
---
Can either you or u/AvWoW explain what the premise of the gamplay is like in that board game?  are they still available? 
---
Reason I ask is because I play the [XCOM board game](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719wQVcHMYL._SL1000_.jpg) and want to know if it's vastly different or a little similar.
---
No, but the rogues are cutting onions.
---
Your welcome.
---
It was a SP + Crit item and I had a SP + mp5 item.  I aruged it was worse and they should just shard it, they argued it was better and master looted it to me.  I vendored it later.
---
About as gross as using your totem as a... Well, I'll just let you imagine &gt;:V
---
How about you finish Hyjal and the other zones which were never finished, ex: South of Stormwind, Badlands and one or 2 others.
---
Make these lands have farming spots for some very valuable mats where they will always be disputed and hell if possible make it possible for inter faction pvp in these zones.
---
You could finally finish Hyjal, slap a raid in it, a 40 MEN raid with gear 5-10% better than Naxx gear slightly better than Naxx and 2 15 men wings, one with Molten core gear quality and the other with ZG gear quality.
---
You can also add a World Boss or 2.
---
You could release these in tears
---
Tear one would be the world bosses and the PVP zones 
---
Tear 2 would be Hyjal with the 2 15 men raids
---
Tear 3 the 40 men raid in Hyjal
---
Literally just played this game 10 minutes ago lmao. Buying ashenvale was a good shout
---
IT's not Medivh, that's for sure.
---
What did the classic GM UI look like?
---
Well, sure optimisation.  But the question was what does he have to buy.
---
Pretty sure you  can see higher res buttocks in real life.
---
I heavily prefer questing in Eastern Kimgdoms up until STV, after that I switch to Kalimdor. There isnt much reason to that, I just like certain zones more than others.
---
Metal panties!!!!
---
Personally I find the classes I play to be the most interesting and it switches depending on which class I'm most into at the moment (I usually have alts). So as a healer I definitely find watching other healers interesting. It depends on the viewer, really.
---
I had a copy on my PC years and years ago. I wanna say it was just about the same as the Xbox release, maybe with some different weapons.
---
Is this a remaster sort of thing? I clearly remember playing it on my laptop between classes in college.
---
Cross faction communication is more relevant now than it ever was during vanilla. If you are able to clearly communicate with the opposite faction it's going to get fixed.
---
Before all you could do is say some silly shit to people. Basically just insults or greeting, but real communication wasn't really possible. Now if there is anyway at all to send a small line of text it is now very easy to just plug that into discord and you are now talking with that person within 30 seconds.
---
The OP didn't know that it was NA only. He made a mistake. He's not a spammer, and he's actually saved a lot of people in here a lot of money today.
---
its either that or shaman.. i want a class no ones going to play...Also i want an easy levelling class..seeing as it will take more than a few months.  i did a hunter when i first played in vanillia which was fun,  Then when i went to private servers i did a Rogue, (Which got easier at level like 30) then did pally(super boring ) 
---
So going to go druid on this.
---
I've been thinking about that. I don't get PvP is all it's cracked up to be. It mostly was just ganking, not epic battles, in my experience.
---
However, I'll be going RP-PvP. Ganking will still ensue but I feel like maybe I'll get a slightly more pleasant playerbase that way.
---
Yea, it seems likely that they'll be coming very close to each other. From a business perspective, it doesn't make much sense as you'd think Blizzard would want to prevent people from dropping their subs, but from a Classic players perspective, it's great news. It'll really cut down the tourists that level past 10 and help ensure a good understanding for server health earlier.
---
Hope so!
---
I will be tanking to get gear for my main spec but I won't be that guy who doesn't invite someone because  they need the same piece. Up to them if they want to come and have a chance at rolling it.
---
I still don't see why that's a guarantee that they will fix it.
---
Undead Priest, possibly a tauren shaman as well
---
&gt; 4. Enhancement Shaman with improved Ghost Wolf
---
Only in TBC where the talented ghost wolf was instant. In vanilla they are not mobile at all
---
Either way it is good news.  Framerate is just one of those things that does not back-scale like people think it will. Eg, Most people prefer to play SNES and other old emulators with high quality up-scaling.
---
I think with the open world nature of original wow, this will be fantastic.
---
No one cares about the multitude of rogues my dude. Roll at your hearts desire.
---
My girlfriend bought me this on our one year anniversary!
---
&gt;while you are getting slight upgrades as Mail &amp; Plate shoulders prior to killing Pyroguard Emberseer
---
Hello sir. Pyro is the first boss in UBRS.
---
To be fair, I’ve got no problem what so ever that a plate user would want leather—I think it’s kinda cool. 
---
What I’m not a big fan of was the lack of gear for hybrids to make them viable. 
---
Little to no leather/mail mp5 nature damage, for example. 
---
I don’t really care that spriest or moonkin do less damage than a mage/lock. They bring utility and buffs for the pures. However, them needing to bring full consumables just to not go oom in 10 casts sucks.
---
Bring in the tax, but they should have made items that make the spec plausible.
---
I played on a Dual 1.42GHz G4 MDD all through Vanilla and early TBC. 
---
If you'd like advice on putting together a super cheap budget gaming PC let me know. I'd bet that you could get a case, mobo, CPU, RAM, power supply, and graphics card capable of smooth play for $200-$350 depending on capability and new/used.
---
You got that mixed up. Classic will still be there in 2 years, 8.2 content will be irrelevant after a few months. Personally I dont care much about that, but if I were to value both somewhat equally 8.2 totally would get the edge in that regard
---
Not from the warriors perspective
---
Do you think the changes to how players perceive the GMs is as a result of:
---
* Players setting unreasonable expectations
---
* Changes in the quality of the GMs that are being hired
---
* Changes in the approach Blizzard takes to community relations
---
I remember when putting in a GM ticket, you'd usually get lots of in-character banter with the GM as they helped you resolve your request.  Today, you get an automated system or just a mail message saying "hey, we fixed it."
---
Would be cool if season servers mixed it up a bit. Playing a server with WotLK abilities/talents was pretty fun.
---
Yeah CE was released on PC many years back but I don't think there was online multiplayer unless you modded it or something like that if I remember correctly. The Master Chief Collection is a remastered set of the games from Halo CE through Halo Reach. They will be releasing the games incrementally on PC as they are ready (supposedly all of them by the end of the year).
---
All yo jealous people negging me. I've got my invite email!
---
Here's a weird idea:   Seasons.   
---
No new servers ate added. No servers wipes.   
---
Instead: server content is placed on  Phase1.    
---
Items obtained in Phase2-6 are "removed" from your stats. You can equip it, but it just gives blank stats.    
---
Battle grounds are closed. World PvP flourishes. People level new toons.   
---
People go back to MC.  
---
Phases are opened quicker than before, new player feel they can participate and not get ROFL stomped.
---
I think an alpha has already been happening within blizzard. 
---
Now take this with a grain of salt and I cant prove anything, and I even have my own doubts about it. But a guy that I work with that I've never questioned about integrity or anything like that says that his friend that works for blizzard in their hardware section has mentioned to him that they have had 12 classic servers up and running for some time.
---
Believe me I know how cheesey it is to say, let alone believe someone that says my a friend knows someone at blizzard and they told me blah blah blah. I dont believe 99% of those people either, but thats just my personal reasoning behind thinking we're still getting a Beta soon. 
---
May also just be high hopes that I dont want crushed.
---
Will this be where you sign up and hopefully get picked for the beta? Looking forward to this!
---
Major.Minor.Release.Build
---
God bless America
---
You are. Ignore that and continue. If you are not in the U.S., never mind.
---
Still more mobile than most classes.
---
I think we are talking past each other a bit. As I said, most of the orcs were tricked, I don’t assign them moral blame, but moral blame is irrelevant when there’s a horde killing thousands of people, you have to fight back, and kill them before they kill you. Again, *from the human point of view* orcs were just demonic savages and they have plenty of reason to believe this. They never saw the orcs in their shamanistic time. Oh, and the Draenei lived alongside the orcs, they didn’t attack them. Not sure where you got that from, but it’s just not supported by lore.
---
Also, I said “merely” as in, he had nothing to do with corrupting the orcs, which is what you originally said, and you were wrong. Obviously he had a lot to do with the invasion of Azeroth, and he was killed for it. Oh, and Gul’dan became a pawn, but he accepted Kil’jaeden’s pact willingly, he was not possessed (like Medivh was, actually). He is not a victim, which is what you seem to be implying, and neither were the rest of the Shadow Council.
---
Explain to me how all these assumptions by you are warranted. So far you’ve assumed I don’t know what it’s like to make $10 an hour, that I haven’t experience paycheck to paycheck lifestyle, that I’m not aware that putting in work grants longevity in a career, that I have a safety net, that I will never progress in my career, that I don’t have something to lose, AND you’ve equivocated everyone’s situation when there’s nothing to go off of aside from not wanting to lose your job, which is fairly universal if you have a job that you don’t hate. I understand my original comment was a bit troll, but this is hilarious.
---
Actually, its checking for spiders and snakes under the cricket bat in the shed.
---
Ohhhh, okay. I just spent five minutes thinking I lost my mind.
---
Reach, too? Reach was awesome! I went from insane to excited.
---
I do, still i want to see the beta
---
It works, I did it.  Shoulda made a psot about it on some forum back then and archived it so you all could cite it as proof  it works.
---
For racking up kills hunter is the best, mage is maybe a bit more useful though.
---
&gt;Basically both types of servers are great when they're great, and bad when they're bad.
---
I agree. Had this been 10-15 years ago, I would have rolled PvP no questions asked. However I'm more established in my life now and play time is far more limited. The downsides to PvP, in my case, make the game unplayable. I need all the advantages I can get to get to 60 in any sort of reasonable time, which is why I'll be rolling a leveling/solo friendly class on a PvE server.
---
Now if you have more free time, taking time off work to level, and/or rolling with a group of friends or guild that can support you, then I'd recommend a PvP server - a lot of these downsides are mitigated by having a fast leveling time or friends who'll come defend you.
---
In my case I'll be spending half my time begging in local defense for someone to come help me not get corpse camped.
---
Yeah the MCC was already available on XBox but didn't include Reach until recently. I am looking forward to this summer!
---
I agree. Up here in Canada, 15 dollars back in 2004 could get you a pretty descent meal. Nowadays, you are lucky if you can get a meal cost 25 or less in a restaurant. 
---
Overall, 15 bucks nowadays means much less. Save 5 Starbucks coffee monthly and you get your subscription.
---
Me and you both brother
---
My dad works at nintendo. 
---
just kidding! Hope he's right haha
---
You asked for opinions, now you have it. If you want guarantees go get on the phone with Blizzard. Nobody here is going to be able to guarantee you anything.
---
You made this under the pretense that you want to know what people think on this topic. Now it's starting to look like you want people to confirm your own belief or tell you that Blizzard is going to allow you to communicate cross faction.
---
I heard that the spiders were big enough to wield the cricket bat.
---
Removing of downranking (well, any meaning of it) for wrath was the reason I quit. I hardcore raided tbc :)
---
Almost all quests from 1-30 are faction specific. Then it starts becoming more and more neutral as you approach 60.
---
For profs, i think Blacksmiths have the most quests. Engis have a short chain. I dont think there are any quests for the others that actually require a specific amount of skill other than fishing/cooking/first aid.
---
All the classes have class quests. Warrior, Hunter, Priest, Rogue and Paladin dont have a whole lot. Mage and Warlock have tons. Druid and Shaman are kind of middling.
---
Lol yeah... Right? thats how I feel when I read something like that. Definitely isn't meant for people to take as a "THIS GUY LEAKED SOMETHING CREDIBLE" its just my reasoning as to why I believe what I do =).
---
Bad idea, company uses more resources and may split the player base.
---
Absolutely; is it weird that i'm so excited about performance in a game where I already run 60fps in the modern version and will limit it to 60 in this? Yes.
---
But thats what being a nerd is about
---
My favorite was:  Why are there no restaurants in Thunder Bluff?
---
Because the waiters are worried about being tipped!
---
While your friend's friend is likely correct, you're confusing categories.
---
Blizzard has internal alpha builds running constantly.  That's what the employees are using to do their work.  They probably have it staged so 12 servers would be 4 with Original 1.12, 4 with build X, and 4 with build Y (or some logical breakdown). That way they can see that 1.12 had one thing, X was different, and Y has something more similar to 1.12 than X was. Half their work over the last two years will have been three-way diffs to see that the changes they're making are getting them closer to 1.12.
---
A Friends and Family Alpha \*must\* be deployed through the Blizzard Agent. That's how it works these days, like BfA and Legion did.  The internal builds won't be using the CDN, but rather directly the build servers.  The build needs to be unencrypted (since we don't have Blizzards employee encryption keys) and it needs to downloaded off the CDN.
---
That's why this is such a big news item.  The first *publicly visible* content is being pushed to their content delivery network.  So likely a Friends and Family Alpha, or a short Beta \*is\* coming.  We just don't have enough information yet.
---
Maybe, but windfury is infinitely more fun to look at
---
If I did that, I'd never get any gear lol, since I never win rolls that matter. I' just prefer to find a group that works best for all involved.
---
I have played all of the healers, and the original vanilla dungeon design is very punishing for line of sight compared to modern retail designs.
---
This is extremely punishing on paladins who do not know the instance.  If you can compensate for this by tanking and knowing all the pulls and areas of line of sight, you can mitigate it.  In my experience, druid is by far the easist to heal most of the time.  Literally their only downside is no-rez, but that can be argued.  A low skill healer that lets someone die in a pull where it is not the tank's fault, and not the dps's fault, is probably not going to survive the encounter unless the tank is well geared.  In this case the rez skill is moot.
---
More than likely, someone will get distracted or miss comunicate, or just get a bad luck string of parry-hasted crushing blows, and the tank will die.  This can easily be saved by a quick battle rez, and you can build her a NatureSwiftness+BRez macro.
---
&gt; I have seen alot of this tri-spec but I feel like its more for dueling? or am i wrong about that? I can't imagine its overly effective as a healer!
---
Not to sound like a broken record, but trade-offs. If your goal is to "JUST" heal, then things like silence don't further that, no. But if you want reasons to be excited about the class compared to say, paladin, tools like silence or especially mana burn bring "non healing" utility that helps you win objectives.
---
Its kind of like your point on holy nova - de-stealthing rogues so they can't sap an ally of yours isn't really a "healing" thing, but its a very valuable part of your toolkit to help you win the fight\objective\battleground. 
---
The painful reality is that if you restrict your purpose to healing, you will likely find yourself outclassed in every theoretical and real way by a paladin. Vanilla is just tons of tradeoffs - maybe things like nova de-cloaking, mana burning, silencing, fearing, offensive dispelling are enough utility to make you feel like the priest is worth it. Or maybe it's not and you should look harder at paladin!
---
They don't even release how many people are playing BfA so I doubt they'll start now.
---
Where you at?  I'm down
---
Not relevant. But you just made me go back to leatherworking/skinning. I never got my finkle Skinner. Even though I ran for it dozens of times. Now I'm determined.
---
Only the mum.
---
I mean, Australia just banned a Peppa Pig episode that says spiders are harmless and you should pick them up and bring them home.
---
What? Your posts were progressively confusing me but I could kinda get your point, now I'm completely lost.
---
&gt; Now it's starting to look like you want people to confirm your own belief or tell you that Blizzard is going to allow you to communicate cross faction.
---
What? I'm just not sure they may care about it. Literally my posts on this thread have been me being unsure they will do anything. 
---
Did  you confuse me for OP?
---
Get tabletop simulator and play it on that.
---
350 ping in Western Australia 🇦🇺 
---
#nochanges haha please god nooooooo
---
I’d honestly expect classic first just for the fact people have to sub to get it. All the more new subs may want to try out 8.2 when it comes out after (doubtful but could be their logic of recapturing people into current wow).
---
Fair point, they will sell it whatever price people are willing to pay. And that majority have said $15 for both retail and classic.
---
Thanks for the heads up on the discount.
---
&gt;upgrade options
---
Oh really?
---
Let's see the pre-DM pre-raid BiS list:
---
* Mask of the unforgiven, leather
---
* Truestrike Shoulders, leather
---
* Cadaverous armor, leather
---
* Slashclaw Bracers, *mail*
---
* Devilsaur Gauntlets, leather
---
* T0 rogue or hunter belt, leather or mail
---
* Devilsaur Leggins, leather
---
* Windreaver greaves, *mail* 
---
Yeah man, there's a lot of non-leather options for hunters.
---
The player base will leave after the naxx patch ends anyway, Also they would have the choice to choose a server so they could just a static 1.18 server with a high population.
---
Or mage, so he can just teleport instead of walking.
---
Awesome man! Did you JOGLE or LEJOG? Also, what are brashers?
---
Keep it at lvl 60. 
---
Open Hyjal, kharazan, gilneas and such.
---
Better itemization for unused raiding specs: enh, ret, shadow, balance. This will change the meta after some years bringing more variety to group content.
---
The core systems of the game should remain intact. No lfr, no transmog, no barbershop, no convenience basically.
---
Classic has a lot of Lore left to be explored. Open some books and go for it w/o increasing the level cap. 
---
Make harder raids with harder mechanics. 
---
Imho. If retail removed all the quality of life added through the years the game would be brimming with life. And even though I understand the appeal od stagnant content, horizontal progression is key to keep the game alive.
---
I dont like getting ganked by higher levels just as much as the next guy but I mean the way i always saw vanilla is that I was doing PvE so i could PvP.  
---
What are you going to do when your character gets some good gear at 60? youre going to sit there in the city afk or youre going to be fighting over resources against people of your own faction and players from the other faction and you wont be able to do shit about it on a PvE server.
---
PvE always gives you something to do because there is always someone fucking with your factions noobs and you gotta protc tehm.
---
I spend more quite a few weekends on beer (without even going to the bar) than a month of wow costs.
---
Its quite literally one of my cheapest hobbies.  
---
I bought a kayak last year that cost more than 2 years of wow...and thats not including *any* of the other expenses i have for fishing.
---
I spend over twice as much on gas every week than i spend on a month of wow.
---
Original Halo was available on PC many many moons ago. It didn't seem as much fun as it was on the Xbox tho.
---
Then that's what you're lookin' for https://classicdb.ch/?item=15047
---
Not if the fresh servers turn over characters back to the old servers. Players would go back to play their characters, and would also have to choice to send it to a more popular 1.18 realm.
---
Honestly, nah. Wait for classic and save your energy. It’s going to be a marathon and a lot of people are gonna burn out before even hitting 60.
---
No, this is not what I’m talking about.
---
Awesome! At the end of that, you should be fairly confident on your class choice.
---
Splitting the player base after naxx won’t happen, because most people won’t be doing naxx.
---
Picking a class for classic was way harder than I expected since all the classes are capable of doing cool and unique things. My original choices were mage and druid since i've mained both for a considerable amount of time on retail but I think im going to change it up this time around and try out warlock. They bring some cool utilities to the table and I absolutely love their go go go pace when leveling, you almost never have to stop to drink or eat.
---
To be fair I've never looked at it in that sense. Guess I'll have to make a pro and con list of each and then compare that to what I want! 
---
Out of interest which of the healers Priest or Paladin have the better mana pool?
---
&gt;what is the right thing to do
---
Simple. Roll on BiS.
---
Maybe wait till the beta is actually out to start complaining?
---
Seeing this stuff still fills me with joy and warm nostalgia feelings. Sometimes I kinda wish the game was still a massive mystery to me the way it was for my first few years.
---
&gt; Explain to me how all these assumptions by you are warranted.
---
--------------------------------------
---
&gt; If you had a full understand of what it's like to be one of the many people that make 10 dollars an hour and are living paycheck to paycheck, you would understand how patently absurd the idea of risking your job for the sake of grinding some gold or xp in a video game is.
---
I've already told you exactly why all of these assumptions are warranted. You either have a safety net or you are stupid and don't care if you end up on the street. It's pretty simple. If you had something to lose you wouldn't have your attitude. 
---
&gt; my original comment was a bit troll
---
Nah, I don't think so. You don't get to back track objectively dumb comments retroactively and pretend you were trolling. Sorry. Nope. Own what you said, you aren't going to convince me or anyone else here that you were just joking. 
---
You're general attitude in the comments you made makes it quite clear you don't take your job seriously if you even have one at all. Most of us aren't looking to cheat our employers like you, which is why you saw a lot of resistance to your comments.
---
#NoAlphaClub
---
I'll have narrowed it down to warlock or warrior at least. Or maybe hunter. I mean you cant rule out mage... Shamans are fun too, also ive never levelled a priest... Oh god.
---
For sure. But at this point it costs so much to keep retail WoW going and profitable that Classic is just a way to perpetuate retail cash flow and being in more cash and potentially more retail players. It’s a value-added measure to get you to sub to retail and maybe buy the next expansion.
---
So in reality they prob will never split the sub because classic will not really cost them that much and if it turns like 10% into retail then it’s paid itself type of thing.
---
Just sucks for the people that want to only play classic and pay a reasonable fee for that select service compared to both retail and classic.
---
an upvote doesnt mean agreement
---
Much like  every body of water has a group of "Welcome Murlocs"!
---
That reminds me of the first time I died underwater, I couldn't figure out how to get my ghost down to res lol.
---
What is the Park Place of WoW monopoly? Molten Core? Or something more pretty like Stormwind?
---
&gt; who cares like there should not be any new models or animations they all either existed in retail or vanilla
---
Nah, its gonna be new models. This does not impact the gameplay and it alllows blizzard to attract pserver players back with better graphics and performance than the legacy client.
---
Don't think anyone will know what to do post naxx until we get closer to it.
---
Classic is part of WoW. Want to play WoW? You pay the subscription.
---
I know that in this subreddit people like to pretend that Classic is a completely separate game but in Blizzards eyes it's part of WoW. Basically a "freebie" for WoW subscribers.
---
This idea is pretty close to what I would personally enjoy.  I would like it if after 3 or so years "mirror" servers were set up for each classic server, where you could mirror your character through to TBC content.  Your original character would still remain intact on the classic server, but you could mirror through to TBC with that character too - basically 2 separate timelines for the same character that diverge at the expansion.  The mirror server's would be tethered permanently to the original classic server so you would keep the same population.
---
Of course this might end up having an unpredictable disastrous effect...it's so hard to know.  I guess the way to have the best chance at not screwing it up is #nochanges and #vanillaforever.  Anything else is toothpaste out of the tube.
---
sure it'll work... but it's still really slow.
---
Let's say a group of 18s go through Deadmines. Killing everything will result in ~11,600xp - if there's anyone above level 18, that goes down slightly, so 10-11,000 per run in the deadmines. And deadmines takes about an hour. so 10-11,000xph
---
killing only 2 mobs a minute grinding at 18 results in 16,200xph, 20,500 if you can sustain 2.5 kills a minute. Optimized leveling path is 18-20,000xph.
---
So yes, you CAN do it. It DOES work. But it's in no way excellent xp, or way better than grinding or questing, it's almost half.
---
The trend continues for all the other dungeons I've done math for, 40-60% slower than traditional methods.
---
Since we're almost certainly getting an updated API it's practically a given that somebody will port Gryphonheart Items over. You can make books/journals and other items with this addon and share with others who use this addon.
---
Yeah it’s the only way they can keep retail going is merge it under the same fee and hope 10% classic players buy the next retail expansion type of thing. It also just helps their shareholders having it all under one sub for cash flow. I understand why they do it, just sucks if you don’t care for retail.
---
It's BiS until Naxx lol
---
That's not right. It even says on the page where you found that that it's mostly speculation.
---
Wait... halo on PC?
---
As a healer positioning in BG PvP is basically your life.  For everyone else though ... yeah just murder whoever you can reach.
---
No, Gul'dan is for sure a piece of shit, but it still wouldn't have happened if not for the Legion, which would not have happened if not for the Draenei leading the Legion to Draenor, and the invasion of Azeroth would not have happened if not for the Night Elves. Not saying the Draenei are at fault for the Legion attacking/chasing them, but they still brought them down on the Orcs. The Night Elves are 100% at fault for bringing the Legion's attention to Azeroth though. 
---
&gt; Oh, and the Draenei lived alongside the orcs, they didn’t attack them. Not sure where you got that from, but it’s just not supported by lore.
---
Yeah, IDK either, my bad. 
---
But, with all that, you'd think the Alliance might try to walk things back a bit, but they kept going, and took it further, enslaving Orcs and all their other shit. Yes, both sides do fucked up shit throughout the story of WoW, but the Horde mostly fucks over the Alliance, the Alliance fucks over everyone. The first thing the Alliance did when Pandaria was discovered was attempt to enslave the Pandaren and use them as front line fodder. Although the Horde did kidnap a few kids as bargaining chips, they didn't hurt them or anything, and were going to give them back if the agreement was made. 
---
The biggest threats the Alliance, mostly the Humans, have faced, are due to other Humans. Medivh and the Portal and Arthas and the Scourge are all due to Humans being corrupted by the Legion in the end.
---
Are you really that cheap?? It's been the same price for years and now that we get more you ask for it to be reduced?
---
Search "Master Chief Collection" on steam :)
---
I plan on rolling a shaman or paladin. It depends on which faction my friends want to play and whether or not character creation is faction-locked. Historically most of them have gone alliance so most likely paladin, with a mage or hunter as a backup farmer.
---
Gotcha that makes a lot of sense. 
---
I was thinking maybe those servers were an internal alpha where they had things more under lock and key so things wouldn't get leaked, but it was still being tested constantly from QC and devs. Which I would still count as an alpha client like OP posted about.
---
I guess my main thing when reading this post is they obviously named SOMETHING wrong since there is an Alpha client on the app and beta files on the CDN, and I'd put more of my money to having something with an old name uploaded to the app rather than completely new content being uploaded to the CDN being named incorrectly.
---
That GM was a douche.
---
I think it makes more sense to release classic first for these reasons:
---
1) releasing classic first will bring back resubbers or new subbing, which brings more activity and hype back
---
2) with all of these resubs/new subs, people may be tempted to test out current wow even though they’re quite a bit different (mostly different audiences but still might have some curious overlapping ones)
---
Classic players have to sub, once classic has been out a week or month those people who came back maybe curious enough to see 8.2. Wouldn’t make much sense to me having classic after or the same time as they could miss out bringing people back. Can only play one wow at a time realistically in the beginning though so might as well stagger them.
---
a sub thats it.
---
You should ride them home.  You'll throw out your back if you try to lift one.
---
Items OK there’s a brief period around 50 where big bad pauldrons and uncommon red plate gear, and a princess theradras’ scepter look cool imo. I’ll cling to that thought while I equip my dress.
---
Raid slots will need filled and mail loot needs to go to someone. Ignore the elitists.
---
I think it all goes back to genuine care in the product and their willingness to bring in people who are passionate about the game.  If you had that, they were willing to work with you and train you to do a job that could help and from there you could give yourself a lot of opportunities because they came up, things were moving quickly!  I believe it's still like that today and the way they have handled Classic WoW so far gives me a lot of optimism that's still the case.
---
You are mixing skill floor and skill cap together. Druids have a high skill floor meaning it requires a lot of skill to succeed in PvP but have low skill cap meaning the amount of things that you can do as a druid is limited.
---
Now, if we were to talk about druid as flag carrier, then thats a different story.
---
You can track ores and herbs pretty close to the same time by just putting them both on a macro and spamming it to toggle between the two.
---
In all likelihood it will work as it did in vanilla.
---
It's been a while, but the boardgame is just the Eastern Kingdoms, not the whole of Azeroth (the BC expansion gives outlands I think). It's a competitive game with two teams, horde vs alliance. You can play 4 to 6 players (or fewer if you have one person control multiple characters).
---
Each player gets to pick a character (race/class is predetermined). If one team plays hunter, that means the other team can't, so team selection is pretty important. You draw quests from various difficulties and lay them around the board. Then you have to decide your quest path. Do you split up for more xp? Stay together for a safer clear? Try to pvp the enemy to slow them down?
---
You earn gold, items, and xp as you quest. You buy talents and spells and equipment and add them to your character card. Each character can build for different specs (ret, holy, tank, mix, etc.). The expansions introduce more cards and items.
---
The goal of the game is to be the first to kill the boss. KT, Nef, etc. You bring your entire team and hope you can beat the boss, but they're HARD. So while you're fighting against the enemy faction, mostly you're just racing to get enough xp and items to take down the boss.
---
I've played 4 or 5 times, and games take 4 to 6 hours depending on how well people know the game. It's an absolute blast because of all the randomness and decision making.
---
The rorqual bees are indeed from EVE
---
Just because it's not on the BiS list, doesn't mean it's not an upgrade.
---
And this post is level 40+, not end-game.
---
The warrior's not the only person in the group.
---
thats just not true at all
---
You really are losing your mind
---
Why does it have a cool down? Or is that tooltip incorrect?
---
Worry less about the highest skill cap and focus more on what class/spec you enjoy the most.
---
What you said about simply logging off if the ganking makes the game unplayable/unfun is very true. It's exactly what I have been doing when leveling through gank infested hell holes like redridge on pservers.
---
&gt; And the general internet culture is a lot more toxic and griefy.
---
This is exactly why I think I'm going PVE.  I can still do battlegrounds if I really wanted to, but gaming in general is so much more toxic now than it was when I was paying Vanilla that I have to imagine griefing will only be that much worse, and I don't really want to deal with dickheads when I only have a couple hours to do some questing the few days a week I'm playing.
---
Did you just assume the paladin to the lefts gender?
---
im not sure i found this poll to be effective, there is no way to see what class/race combos people picked :/
---
Damn, that sounds fun.  I'd play it with you if you were close!  Shame that time+markup has driven the price to close to 500 dollars for it online...
---
Rofl.
---
I came from the north side every time too but just because I was horde too and came in from Kargath. 
---
I pretty much never explored burning steppes except for a few times. Never quested there for sure.
---
what are you talking about ?
---
I'll be streaming it when my key comes
---
What a crazy time. Wow.
---
Incorrect
---
Just because a class requires a lot of skill to play does NOT mean that it has high skill cap.
---
What's the dumbest or funniest place you've seen someone get stuck? Where they really stuck or just not clever?
---
I'm in the same boat as you and I've decided to go PVE. 
---
I was a teenager when vanilla came out and the idea of being able to kill on sight enemy players was very appealing to me. 
---
Now that I'm 30 the appeal just isn't there.  I've been playing a little bit on a prominent private server and it just seems like a ton of griefing. Many lower level questing areas are basically uninhabitable due to high level characters camping towns and quest locations.
---
I don't think they had any choice but to allow it in some form.  I was very happy with the compromise they reached, because it was really clear that loot trading in 5 mans was not the experience the community wanted, but having seen so many tickets of people freaking out in raid loot situations I knew there was a need on the player level.
---
When I worked there one of the biggest problems we were facing was finding work stations to put GMs on.  We couldn't hire people fast enough to keep up with the queues and we out grew our building 3 times in 3 years.  Having lived through that I can understand why they approached this round differently.
---
The compromise gave me a lot of hope that they really cared about giving players the classic experience they want, and for that I am really excited!
---
I agree. What happens after Naxx is a problem that will at some point have to be addressed. All proposed solutions, including 'do nothing', seem to have flaws. I'm glad it's not my job to solve it.
---
Don’t play then, they still put a lot of work and resources to bring classic and will continue to work and fix any bugs or even add additional content to it later on.
---
I'd say even Warriors are more mobile tham Shamans.
---
Shamans aer only better than Paladins, Priests and Warlocks, and really not by much. If you are being hit, this 1 sec Ghost Wolf will take forever to be cast
---
No, druid skill cap is not high. Its skill floor is tho.
---
That’s kind of the point. I want to feel the disappointment first hand!
---
Great stuff man. Your videos are really well done. I look forward to more of them. Cheers.
---
Yes, it's a stupid question. A question so many people always ask for every beta in every game with an economy. And the answer is always the same, nothing will persist.
---
Any abuse of GM powers was a ticket to the unemployment office.
---
They definitely were keeping track.  How much when and where I am not sure.  The general policy was to not take tickets on a realm you had a personal character on.  It was way easier just to never mix the two and not think about it.
---
hes a retail boi and thinks that rogues in 1.12+ are still as broken as in previous patches, and we all know that this means the cleans only requires a single button press once every 15 minutes to kill everyone at all times
---
I know I want to go Horde/PvP server but I'm really torn on class  
---
Hunter - my original main in vanilla. I know my way around the tricks and it would be fun to kite again. I haven't played many other games with characters that felt like vanilla hunter. But - I've done this already?
---
Druid - played in BC BGS a lot and loved it, but never raided seriously on it. I love PvP as druid though.   
---
Priest - pvpd and raided a bit as a priest somewhere in WoTLK. They are powerful and sought after - I could save people's from certain death all over the battlefield with the disc spec. When I raided I felt a bit bored though like every raid was the same.   
---
Warlock - I've never played warlock past lvl 10. I've always heard I should try it since I love the other pet class so much. I know there's usually few warlocks available. This would be totally unknown playstyle for me.   
---
Decide my fate reddit?
---
That depends - did you just assume the paladin's directional orientation?
---
Pretty sure this happened to me. Hey I was 15 at the time. Lol.
---
Honestly as an armchair-dev, it seems entirely possibly that they might have just forgotten to change the string from "alpha" to "beta".
---
Like, it's listed as beta on the network, which they had to push themselves/is intentional. It's not like they just reused the "wow_classic_beta" servers from some other Classic beta. But they've been using an alpha client for some time now. It seems easy enough to just forget to change the build name.
---
Haha that is awesome!  
---
Yeah we had moments where a little creativity was needed!  On a game that size it's inevitable fixing one thing breaks something else so sometimes you just gotta ride it out until there is a fix!
---
An invite only beta doesn't make sense to me. It'll be a short, public stress test, or there won't be a beta at all
---
Goat of Fenris
---
And learning texts in LFR.
---
"_In 10 seconds, move (far) away from other people to avoid doing damage to yourself and others._"
---
"_In 10 seconds, stack with the other players to split the incoming missile damage._"
---
Examples of what would probably be something that could help people learn in LFR without having to use dungeon journal, which we all know _nobody_ does.
---
Your loot distribution isn't fair at all. Do you not understand how hard it would be for warriors to get their BIS if they can't roll on them most of the time? Just because they might get another upgrade that other classes can't roll on?
---
So what if someone can get multiple upgrades in a dungeon while someone else can only get one? If your BIS drop, you should roll on it unless agreed to beforehand that it's reserved to someone. Might be easier to find upgrades on a warrior but classes all have their advantages and disadvantages in classic. It take way longer to level a warrior to 60 for example.
---
Good to know, as a Pally ill roll need on all BiS gear for tanking, healing, and DPS
---
I take it you have personal experience of pushing the Druid skill floor as low as it can go?
---
Doesn't change the fact that there's very little mail upgrades in dungeons. I'm not going to pass on a big upgrade just because a rogue can also use it.
---
40+ includes endgame, especially in this thread where half the people are talking about endgame.
---
That's actually a very solid advice, thank you! I'll definitely scour eBay to see if something interesting comes up.
---
There's no clear cut winning with this.  
---
  There's a big problem with private servers, in that there's always a rotation, people don't stay put, after naxx servers are constantly  resetting and then comes other server and takes it's place and everyone migrates here, it's a never ending cycle. 
---
  Why?   
---
  Because you can only do so much stuff post naxx, blizz is never gonna restart servers and fresh servers would be a never ending ordeal that would get smaller and smaller populations each time.   
---
  The best and most possible route is simply classic+ content, stuff they never finished like dragon isles or even new stuff, all with classic game philosophy, while possibly keeping a couple or so realms on 1.18
---
4-6 hours pshh what a casual
---
I might try it but I'm a bit skeptical... Parallels work wonders on old games, but I'm afraid WoW is a bit too much. It doesn't hurt giving it a try, though.
---
That's a perfectly fine reason, questing in zones you enjoy makes it all the more fun
---
Then how do you zoom your camera in and out?
---
And you will quickly get blacklisted if you are taking dps gear from a rpgue or warrior while also taking healing or tanking gear. If you are holy and healing a dungeon and roll need on the main tank's BiS item, you will just get kicked. No big deal.
---
Well, I don't think I'm confusing these two. If your definition of skillcap is :
---
&gt; low skill cap meaning the amount of things that you can do as a druid is limited. 
---
Then it further goes in my direction, as Druid can do much more things in general than Hunters, no matter the skill level, and it's not even only about FLag Carrying.  
---
You're right that Druids probably have the highest skill floor too as you can't do much clicking only 4 keys as opposed to most other classes, but the skill cap is still probably the highest of all classes. I admit this is not necessarily what I was thinking of concerning the definition of skillcap. To me it was more about how much skill it takes to play the class flawlessly.
---
Thanks, I appreciate it, although another user here suggested I might upgrade my current setup by scooping a nice used Mac which could solve my problem and give me also a nice performance boost (which I really don't need atm, but it never hurts!)
---
This is hilarious considering how few classes actually use their sets, besides putting them on just to show them off in the city, then changing to completely different and non-set gear for raiding.
---
It's just as hard as it is for a rogue if the rogue is being challenged by warriors and hunters most of the time.
---
Plus, my distribution can be modified by communication.  If you're a warrior and you want that gear, you can ask if you can roll on it (about 50/50 the rogue will say "yes"), or you can do runs without a rogue.
---
It's not impossible.
---
Thank you!  No one is ever ready for that news when they first get to work! :(
---
As rough as it was as the time, the end result was really nice.  The fact they were willing to look past some struggles wasn't lost on me and I still appreciate it.
---
I actually remembered that. I knew it was wrongly handled on private servers. Only in TBC did that change, where pets were stunned instead.
---
You have to work hard to look good, that's the beauty of vanilla
---
Blue post in 15 mins
---
Whoever wins the roll on the BIS item get it is what's more fair. You can't compare BIS to an upgrade. What you're advocating for would make getting BIS items on a warrior way harder than a rogue which isn't fair.
---
You are missing all of the specializations' ( such as Elemental Leatherworking ) bonuses.
---
Could probably easily remake it in tabletop simulator and play it online.
---
I should've specified, rap is 40 per 20 agi, ap isn't.  The point is for agi hunters' get a fixed amount of dps and a small amount of crit (that scales) while shamans and warriors get no ap but the largest value that scales (and cat form druids get ap and also the largest scaling).
---
So you’re a radiologist, but can barely form a cognitive sentence? Also most radiologists have more schooling than an average doctor...
---
You dont understand - you must watch this 2 hour clip to fully grasp the cituation ^^^^^^/s
---
Thanks for doing this
---
They should expand the bank slots, just to collect all the Tier sets :D
---
Appears the discord link is broken
---
What does that even mean??
---
Whats your definition of skill cap and skill floor?
---
Yeah was just going to suggest that, I did this with a few mates years ago.
---
Warrior + healer = Win.
---
Druid or Shaman would be great.
---
Try this one for the current beta dump:

https://classic.wowhead.com/blacksmithing-spells?filter-any=112:112:113:113;28377:28211:28377:28211;0:0:0:0
---
Say a leather and a plate piece drop.  The leather piece is BiS for both the warrior and the rogue, and the plate is an upgrade for the warrior.
---
If the rogue gets the leather and the warrior gets the plate, both got upgrades.  If the warrior gets the leather and the plate, then the rogue gets nothing.
---
Because the warrior has more upgrade opportunities, the only fair **default** loot distribution system (i.e. system where no communication is required) is that the Warrior will watch to see if the Rogue needs or greeds before deciding to roll need on leather.
---
Now, if the warrior communicates "I would like to roll on that because it is BiS", then the rogue can be chill and say "sure", or the rogue can say, "I'm sorry, but it's leather".
---
But if you flip the situation, and it's a piece of plate, then the Rogue has no option.  He can't use it, so he has no claim to it at all.  Because of this situation, that's why rogues and druids should have first dibs on leather.  This isn't a huge issue for the warrior, because:
---
1. Many groups don't have a rogue or druid
---
2. Many groups have a rogue or druid who already has the piece the warrior wants
---
3. Many groups have a rogue or druid that is chill, and will let the warrior roll
---
Fixed, thank you.
---
same, same! i started in BC and i caaaan't wait to go back and level along with my husband :)
---
But what if I'm offspec healing or tanking but main spec DPS? Seems like an easy way to double dip
---
Mmmm bababa.
---
Have you tried the blizzard classic forums as well? Don't forget the EU version too! barrens.chat? /v/ threads? dont bother with /vg/ threads those are cancer. Oh, and there are active discord channels for everything you can think of too!
---
On second thought, maybe I'm not helping in the way you wanted.
---
Add bloodline set bonus for tailoring?
---
...but that is literally exactly what it means....like the definition of a high skill cap...
---
It's not a retail sub. It's a Classic WoW sub that lets you play on a retail server for free whenever you want.
---
You joke, but my buddy said this weekend that he is in the progress of recreating his old music playlist from 2005 as best he can to get the true experience.
---
Not frowned upon at all. For PvE, the stats on the items are far more important the its armor type.
---
Numpad - +
---
Don‘t do that to my heart.
---
I can‘t even take a look before 60 mins from now.
---
Theres a looking 4 Group Thread every week on monday
---
think that would be a better place to look for members
---
cheers
---
I remember Emerald Dream US, I'd play on a RPPVP solely for the world pvp
---
then don't play it? No one is twisting your arm.
---
I have the feeling that all questions like... what about after Naxx will disappear when  Classic launches.
---
We just have too much free time atm. :D
---
&gt; IT‘S LIKE THE D3 HYPE BUT WORSE SINCE THIS TIME WE KNOW IT‘LL BE A GOOD GAME    
---
 Lmao fuck
---
There are no wolves on Fenris.
---
Too true haha
---
Plenty of people in many professions don't type or "computer" very well at all. Almost every VP/CEO I've interacted with can barely manage to open outlook. 
---
Just as you're able to type and likely amount to nothing, those that amount to something are entirely capable of just being lazy.
---
well if you are talking leveling stage, then the healer might take your item aswell. if you are talking about endgame stage, then its the best rolls wins. Grinding gear is a grind, there is no shortcuts to get your bis. unless you reserve gear.
---
Ohh I'm sorry I may have misunderstood your first comment. Skill floor is minimum skill required to play competently. Skill celling is how effective you can be with maximum skill.
---
I thought you were staying the skill floor was low, but you were saying the floor was high. That's a more interesting statement, can you explain why you feel that way?
---
No?  
---
  A skill cap is what the class can do when its being played to its fullest potential.
---
People who say this had been playing wow for 10 years and peaked 1500 arena rating lmao
---
You can try to ask your group to roll on dps gear if you are healing or tanking and see what they say. If they really need a healer but I would try to find a holy pala first rather than have a ret pala. Tank is a bit different because a dps spec warrior can easily tank the dungeon and its often harder to find a tank than a healer. So its more common to have a dps warrior tanking runs and still going for dps gear. In the end, make the decision as a group.
---
Entertainment / hour cost calculation for me.  Wow / Netflix make sense.
---
This is dope. Can't stop doing the same.
---
I’m probably going to main a human warrior again. I plan on shooting for an OT/fury slot this around instead of full time tanking. It’s fun but I don’t think I’ll be playing as regularly as I did before. 
---
I may also try an orc rogue. I had a lot of fun with my dwarf rogue in vanilla but never leveled to 60 on horde.
---
I wasn't, I had moved on a year earlier but I just reread it and holy smokes what a ride!
---
I would love to know I really would, but it seems like the GM may have legitimately spawned it trying to spawn something else and accidentally sent it.  I am only speculating here, but if they weren't willing to give the account back, I can't imagine there wasn't a job lost over this.
---
Add a space after "http://gofguild.azurewebsites.net/" the Not that follows it ruins the URL.
---
I think today people generally know what items are priority for which classes, like the 2 one handed dagger and sword from ZG are BIS for hunters and no rogues will get that over a hunter.  Similarly strikers mark and blastershot from MC are both melee weapons and no hunter should even want those.  Ranged weapons are not automatically hunter prio
---
i am not a new player, but here to wish you good luck in finding a group of other newbies!!!! you're gonna have fun :)
---
i'm so excited for professions to mean something!
---
It's fair to everyone if everyone can roll on a BIS item. As a physical damage dealer, you are competing against other physical damage dealers for gear. Certain leather pieces are BIS for everyone and everyone should have the same opportunity to roll on them.
---
You keep bringing the "warrior can also get upgrades from plate gear" argument but it also goes both ways. There are good leather upgrades a rogue can get that a warrior won't roll on because it's not their BIS.
---
Finally, the communication part is on the rogue. It's accepted that a warrior DPS should roll on a leather piece if it's BIS for them. If you don't want that then communicate with your warriors or don't invite them. It's been that way in retail vanilla and it's still this way on private servers.
---
I'm completely expecting a blue post either today or tomorrow. Based Kaivax wouldn't possibly let us down, would he?!
---
&gt; What are you going to do when your character gets some good gear at 60?
---
I keep doing PvE and try to obtain even better gear in dungeons/raids? 
---
&gt;PvP always gives you something to do because there is always someone fucking with your factions noobs and you gotta protc tehm.
---
You realize that players on PvE realms can join BGs?
---
There are certainly subjective reasons for rolling on a PvP server, but yours are absolute garbage.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bde04x/looking_for_group_monday_april_15_2019/
---
Ah, cool. I just assumed since it was green like all other raid portals
---
Depends on what you want to do at 60
---
Maybe I have misunderstood the definition of skillcap ? To me, skillcap was "how much skill is needed to play your class to its maximum (or almost)". Correct me if I'm wrong. Though, taking my definition, I stand my ground on the fact hunters aren't specially hard. I really had to learn only 3 things in PvP compared to other classes ; micromanage my pet, rotate well viper/serpent/scorpid sting so it doesn't fuck up my traps or scatter, and have a good timing of scatter/concussive to kite people who are trying to enter my dead zone. 
---
Eventually Aspect dance too, but the only thing hard about it is having 3 free binds left. Someone jumps on you in melee ? Monkey. Wanna escape when not directly attacked ? Cheetah. Far enough ? Hawk. And having these up, outside of cheetah, won't make a substantial difference most of the time anyway.
---
The rest is pretty basic, wether it's use of traps or PvP DPS rotation. No CS, no instant ranged/castable CC which need reaction time to help your teamates (well maybe scatter, but it's situational depending on where you stand). No downranking. No healing, no dispelling, no buffing. Pretty straightforward. The rest, wether it's positionning or playing with LoS is common to all classes anyway.
---
My keyboard has a button that disables/re-enables it. It's pretty great.

I'VE BEEN KNOCKING AND KNOCKING AND KNOCKING AND KNOCKING
---
Get a butter knife and pop that sucker out, then lose it.
---
I see three paths for the game post naxx assuming the plan isn’t to let the servers stagnate and die.
---
1. Classic BC
---
2. Server restarts, completed servers get condensed 
---
3. New post naxx level 60 content
---
1. Pretty self explanatory, the natural progression is to take the classic, pre cataclysm world to its ICC conclusion. 
---
2. Similar to the model we see with knronos. K1 and 2 have naxx released and beaten they are now one merged server. New server pop up for a new progression.
---
3. A post naxx pre bc 20 man designed to bridge the gear gap between aq40 and naxx, as zig did with mc and bwl or aq20 did with bwl and aq40.
---
I see option 2 to be the easiest, 1 to make the most sense thematically and 3 to be unrealistic yet the potential best for the long term health of a then static server. A post naxx 20 man, maybe 6 months after naxx release, wouldn’t affect the race and could be full of items and off tier sets designed to open up and make ‘barely’ viable specs a bit more.
---
It wouldn’t affect any server progression beyond guilds struggling 6 months after the fact—which is what it’s designed for.
---
I’ll accept my downvoted from the #nochanges brigade
---
Yeah any abuse of powers was an automatic loss of employment.  
---
The tabs are likely kept on your GM account, but those details and what the extent are aren't shared.  When a GM plays the game it's on the normal game client exactly as any other player.
---
[there you go](https://m.youtube.com/results?search_query=rick+roll)
---
Haha so got damn true. Life has a holy paladin. You look like a fucking clown If you want to optimize
---
Get gud, only a key mashing nub has these issueZ
---
No it is how hard it is to play, a high skill cap means to maximize the POTENTIAL of your class or whatever..how much skill you need to do so.
---
It has NOTHING, absolutely nothing, to do with a classes actual potential damage, healing, tanking, etc.
---
It is only about how much skill you need to actually maximize that class.
---
No, because the genuinely most fun I've had playing this game is outside Mauradon and Sunken Temple running into groups of the other faction trying to kill the quest bosses/get in the dungeons and fighting them for it, as well as killing the end-of-chain mobs for the nessingwary quests while also fighting other groups. Without the conflict over resources the game becomes a huge snoozefest after the thousandth bear ass, then you also don't get to fight people for herbs/skins/mining nodes at 60 and you just sort of kill differently shaped bears for their differently shaped asses over and over again with 40 people to get loot for yet more simplistic bear fights.
---
You just made up that number, xp depends on your level, mob level and total levels in your party.
---
I mean...Warrior + Druid is a better combo. You have heals so you two will have instant instance groups for anything you want. Hunters just don't combo well with anybody since they're so effective solo.
---
That being said, it's not like Warrior + Hunter is exactly a bad combination. It's most important that you play the class that you're happiest playing, then once you decide that, find out how best to work together.
---
Thanks, I'm a bit of a reddit noob and appreciate you pointing that out.
---
You 'can' play retail too....&lt;snicker&gt;
---
interesting, so the charge should only stun once reaching the target? or is it just the pathing then? I cant remember what issues were there for macros, I use itemrack or outfitter addon to change gear with a keybind and then switch stances regularly
---
So it’s a retail sub with freebie classic access you mean?
---
What was your age when you started as a GM?
---
Don't be so sure!
---
apparently BRE is in its 1.12 state, from a dataminer
---
Good idea, just get so drunk you don't notice if you accidentally hit the Windows key!
---
thanks for the reminder I just checked my account settings didn't have Warcraft checked
---
We could look up where the logins were happening, but it wasn't something that would flag anything necessarily.
---
Hacked accounts were pretty common.  If someone messaged in and said they got hacked between X time frame and they went from being logged in from Ohio then suddenly in China, then all of their items and gold went missing, you have a pretty good idea of what happened.
---
Thats just the latest possible release date
---
I'll be volunteering and the prep starts next month gonna be fun and keep my mind busy hehe.
---
Hey  a warrior got a bandage heal just roatate targets and it will be fine.  /S
---
You mind telling me what this other fellow replied?
---
Yeah I think because classic is I guess kind of a port, alpha will be does it run and not crash kind of stuff.
---
Looks interesting :)
---
What do you mean by "level 1 min tradeskill"? That you can learn all primary professions at level 1?
---
**Guild Name:**
---
&lt;Get of Fenris&gt;           
---
**What’s it mean?:**
---
“Fenrir” or “Fenris” is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr’s hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse.  The word “get” in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus “Get of Fenris” translates roughly into “the children of the wolf god who brings about the end times”.
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general “gamer rudeness” and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world. So what about loot and stuff?:
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.
---
**What Gets us apart:**
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of “scalps” (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage). This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it’s cool. !&lt;
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we’re a good fit for you!
---
**A Brief History:**
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could. Region: North America - WestServer Type: PvPFaction: HordeRaid Times: TBD but likely evenings during the week, and early day during weekends (to allow for night activities IRL)Guild Priorities: Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days).

Below is a screenshot of our custom site in Beta. Here members will be able to see upcoming guild events, manage raiding schedules, track EPGP, see donation pricing (updated weekly), wishlist loot (which also streamlines raiding), create and fulfill bounties on GoF’s Most Wanted list, watch our members live-stream and of course there’s forums to talk privately in “members only land”.
---
Great!  Thank you for posting on the 'I was a Game Master during Vanilla WoW AMA!' have a wonderful day and enjoy the rest of your journey posting on reddit! ;)
---
the fact of the matter is if you play Alliance you will probably be on a server that has more horde. In which case you will get camped, you will get team killed, and the game will be harder for you. If you're horde it's the opposite.
---
On the contrary. It's actually old people like me who have these issues. Can't turn back that clock, my friend.
---
How rough are yall with your keyboard if that is an issue? I use all the keys surrounding the windows key and never have an issue and I am prone to failure.
---
Is this what RP servers are like?
---
I searched for them, but I was unable to find any except for the listed ones for Goblin, Gnome and Armor. Would you mind pointing me in the right direction, or giving me an example of an item I missed?
---
Eh. I guess it's time I bought a new keyboard anyway...
---
Druid and hunter are top. The amount of little tricks hunter has or the insane amount of keybinds they need for pvp etc. I have hunter off and on since halfway through vanilla and I still find stuff I didn't know about the class.
---
yank that bitch off.
---
Do NOT go anything higher than 15" in terms of screen size. You will regret it
---
The no changers don’t even want to consider that wow won’t have 8k pop servers forever.
---
Thanks! Hopefully I find some future newbs here, but I'm sure if not then in game!
---
I use keyboard profiles that auto switch when certain games are launched. It also sets the 1-6 keys to auto fire so I can just hold them down rather than spam pressing. It's nice.
---
I do have this one in there:
---
* Set bonus: Bloodvine Garb 3/3 - Effect (Tailoring 300)
---
Is there another one I missed?
---
Ull find Asus ROG with very good specs in ur budget, they have good reputation among gamers
---
It’s the principle of the matter that if you just want to play classic, you are basically paying for full retail access to just play classic that doesn’t cost anywhere near retail costs to keep it active. I’d like a different price point for only classic access because that’s all I will play. It’s the same value and better if you play retail already, but I haven’t played retail or payed for wow since TBC, and I’m not the only one.
---
I understand for retail players it’s an awesome extra bonus, but for people just coming for classic, what is the $15 really going to—it’s going to cash flow to keep retail alive. Classic really isn’t costing them anything, they don’t have to pay a Dev team constantly to put out new content like retail.
---
Fixed in 1.11 IIRC.
---
\*the Burning Lesion
---
Hunter is so freakin hard to master in pvp, you can perfect any class any time if you're great
---
It comes in handy when I'm doing work. I could always just click on the start button, but wow has taught me that clicking on things causes cancer...
---
UNTIL THEN THROW MORE DOTS MORE DOTS
---
....
---
CMON MORE DOTS
---
That is one very necessary /s you got there
---
Schould maybe hang around for a while in such situations. Could be interesting.
---
Blizzard is though. If I want to play, I gotta pay for retail and classic at the retail sub fee.
---
I wouldn't take a single naming case too seriously.
---
Nope, you're good, I must be going blind.
---
Why? Was thinking of getting a 17.3
---
I think frostadamus did a YouTube video about the LW specs, might be worth a watch
---
If you include salt shaker for leather working, you should include mooncloth for tailoring and arcanite for alchemy.
---
Blizz with classic is like wizards of LotR - never early, never late, just when it's meant to be.
---
You better believe active subs are getting selected first. Unfortunate, but I rather not burn myself out on a beta before the real deal anyways.
---
&gt; will I miss part of the danger?
---
You can always flag for PvP on a PvE server when questing! I think you'll probably end up in more fair/reasonable fights that way, too. 60s won't be hanging in lowbie zones looking for kills - but the opposite faction players around your level in the zone might choose to start a fight if they see you flagged.
---
I was so dissapointed that Halo 2 PC was such a botch. I had so much fun with Combat Evolved.
---
C L A S S I C
---
no no no you get so drunk you spill it on the Windows key and it stops working altogether
---
No, if you think it's too much, then don't pay for it. And, in fact, you have a free option in private servers.
---
That's how every other financial transaction in the world works. I'm not sure why you think it would suddenly be different here.
---
I think it's mentioning the fact that the salt shaker is an item that requires a specific LW level to be used, rather than mentioning the daily CDs.
---
what I mean is you're being cheap.
---
Quest exp is never affected correct?
---
Druids are VERY limited to what they can do in vanilla compared to other expansions though. You can't shapeshift from one form to another for starter, you need to go human form everytime. Their forms have very few abilities. There's only so much you can do as a druid in vanilla.
---
You were wrong
---
Trump for warchief 2020
---
I guess it was discouraged since he will be wasting time doing actual work.
---
&gt;You just made up that number, xp depends on your level, mob level and total levels in your party.
---
I know how it works, that's why I factored all that into my math for looking into dungeons as sources of XP.
---
Want to see my math?

Here's a table of mobs in the deadmines, their level, and how many of each are in the dungeon. Their levels along the top, 1 for nonelite, 2 for elites to factor in XP rates. Then a section for the base XP of that level mob at character level 18-21.
---
Then mathed out further for total XP from all of that mob in the dungeon, at given levels. Base xp x elite multiplier x xp at that character level x # of mobs.

So at level 18, killing all the mobs results in a total of 41,612 base xp.
---
Grouped with 4 others, you get a bonus of 1.4x so they're worth 58,257xp
---
Group xp is then divided by # of members in the group, so 11,651
---
______________
---
So yes... I totally made up the "deadmines is worth about 11,600xp at level 18" numbers. My numbers might be a bit off, but I'm pretty damn certain they're accurate enough.
---
Just stop slapping your keyboard and generally you never accidentally push it. Not enough for it to become an issue at least lmao
---
I've watched it, but I can't remember seeing anything made by Dragonscale, Elemental or Tribal that relied on LW or the specialization in any way. All the items they make seem to be BoE and not require any professional skill to use.
---
Maybe I will watch it again just to make sure.
---
No we couldn't see which add ons you had, but we could identify issues being caused by them most of the time.  Add Ons caused us a lot of problems for us actually, because players would use all kinds of weird ones that were out of date and half functioning and the whole deal.
---
The worst we would run into would be a player having an issue but refused to turn off their add on.  We would convince them to do so and it would fix the issue, but now they are mad they can't use the Add On.  Blizzard makes the game not the add on, we can't help you they ruin the game, we can only help you get it back to functioning the way we know it should.
---
for group? no, only if you outlevel the quest by &gt; 5 levels.
---
We can see the link...
---
There are plenty of companies that offer a service at different tiers of value. It’s extremely common...
---
And you are being closed minded. Goes both ways.
---
You work, game and browse the internet (read as porn) from the same computer?
---
First of all I never said it had anything to do with damage, healing, tanking or whatever.  
---
Second is, you are mixing stuff together. Your definition is more or less the same as mine but your understanding of it is not correct.  
---
To get a proper understanding of the concept I recommend that you read this: https://vanillamage.com/vanilla-skill-cap/
---
so let's see the formula.
---
The data was found amongst some of their old drives actually.
---
They then modified a legion client to accept the data so that it was encased in modern protections.
---
This data was filled with small errors because of the implant into the legion client so they are now smoothing everything out.
---
Just watch the BlizzCon panel. It would be a novel to explain, but in the simplest of terms: MPQ to CASC.
---
I would consider those CDs to be exclusive benefits to those professions, would you not?
---
Oh hell yeah. Thanks!!!
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM

Watch this
---
Thank you!!!!
---
New desktop achieved.
---
People complain about the cloth gear but there's loads of amazing leather/mail and even plate healing bits.
---
Tbh I'll sacrifice like 20 healing and 7 extra mp5 to look better
---
There were flying herbalists and underground miners hacking wow even up to cataclysm. Then the duping started. Much of this vulnerability of wow client has been fixed. So that is what taking the old drives of wow and making them combine with the new.
---
How about Mining being able to get Arcane Crystals from Rich Thorium? and Alchemy Transmutations too - Arcanite and Elemental Fire being two key examples.
---
No one watches wow streams for the dank gameplay. People watch for the personality
---
I do work and play games on it, yes.
---
Damn, that one is actually interesting to think about :)
---
I feel pretty certain about including Arcanite Skeleton Key and the rest of the keys, while excluding Steel Weapon Chain and such. But damn, Salt Shaker and Mooncloth is interesting to think about. Not entirely sure how to draw the line there :)
---
I started on Tichondrius, but my Horde guild was on Akama.
---
Hi, /u/OneBillBeer
---
So before they started leashing mobs, I would kite the green dragons from ashenvale into orgrimmar to kill people.  I did this like 3 times i a row, but on the 4th and later attempts, I kept getting ported back to the green dragons as I was kiting them and they would kill me.  I don't think it was a LOS issue, was it a GM?
---
There used to be a file you could download from the microsoft site that would hard disable it, but it was removed :(
---
My keyboard has a button for it anyway
---
great thanks for the info. Have seen some weird GMs in other F2P games that are not that strict
---
Lots of fishing will be had for me 🎣
---
I'm sure they wouldnt mention December 31st if it was slated internally for like june lmao
---
I think private servers might skew perception a bit as well because a lot of people there are serious try hards and you can guarantee after the first wave of levellers the next wave will be enchants and pots to chug.
---
 I levelled to 40 on one recently as a shadow priest. I remember levelling one in classic and I could more than hold my own. On this server basically if I saw anyone I was dead because they were so well geared with fiery or crusader or whatever. 
---
That just won’t happen for a long time on a classic server. I say when the fight is fare, bring it on
---
I can and I will.  And any guild I was in did, too.
---
I haven't watched a single episode and will not until he finishes the books.  I started reading that series over 10 years ago and 5 years in between books is ridiculous.  If it was writer's block or something I'd understand, but he's stalling on the books so he can soak in the glory of the series.  Screw that, waiting for the book.
---
Lol what? No. The only way they hold aggro is if group politely holds back dps.
---
Do you manually go into the registry to change it every time? Because you could just have a .reg file do it instead. Or write a small PowerShell script to check if it's off/on and switch it to the opposite.
---
If we go by my logic, you're communicating with your team and picking which groups to join, and you can get gear just fine.

Literally, what?
---
Well that and they said battle.net is just straight up incompatible with the old 1.12 code. Pretty sure at blizzcon they said "first thing we did was just plug it in"
---
I played vanilla a TON.  Mained a NE sword rogue, had aqr/Cts and the armor that went with it.  
---
Had some (4) RL friends who got hooked from the 2$ 3 day trial, and they ended up rolling horde on same server.  I grabbed a second account and leveled a warlock with them.  Once we hit 60 they started collecting he PvP gear which at this time was given away easily just by honor.  Once they had the r14 weapons they would not stop talking about how they could destroy my rogue and this and that.
---
One day I was on my lock is STV and I told them all to come down and help me kill this damn rogue.  What I did not tell them was, I was the rogue.   They came down and I killed all 4 of them over and over till they started spirit rezzing, then continued to kill them till they entered the safety of booty bay after few more Rez attempts.
---
I then told them via vent that it was me.  They got real quiet and never talked shit to me about a video game again hahah.
---
Other thing that stands out is our first vael kill came down to a pally bubble range executing the boss down.  
---
Won’t forget these moments ha
---
Vanilla was a complete sandpit SLOG compared to how the game is now. I don't mean it in a bad way, but nothing is snappy and mobile at all in vanilla. Classes with burst of speed cooldowns were crippled by long cooldown times on them making them more escape tools rather then get there quicker ones.
---
That said, some classes had advantages. 
---
Hunters had aspect of the cheetah which gave them and everyone in their party a movement speed boost as an aura. The downside was if you got hit while active, it would daze you so it took some juggling.
---
Shaman (horde only) at level 20 get ghost wolf. You shift into a wolf, similar to druids cheetah form, to move quicker.
---
Druids had cheetah form. Not sure on the level, 20?
---
The problem with all of the mobility things is you had to shift out of them to do anything. It made the slog from A to B quicker but not once you got there. There are some other things i'm not listing like engineering's rocket boots and stuff. Mage has blink which is a semi-short cooldown you could use to get around quicker. Was super helpful for jumping off anything if you got good at timing before hitting the ground too.
---
Face pulled Rag thanks to 2 am sleep deprivation after a night of wipes.   
---
MT asks me to park my Imp near him for the stam buff, the critical issue being that he didn't mean *right now*. I jump through the lava to the inner circle to place him, then realize why I'm suddenly in combat and the raid leader is screaming on Ventrilo. We somehow scrambled together and down him despite the previous 3-4 wipes, and the Eye drops.   
---
I got off with a reprimand that I either never face pull again, or must always guarantee a legendary drops when I do. I elected to just not face pull.
---
No.  Communication is on anyone rolling lower tier.  By default, the warrior should wait and see if the rogue needs the piece.  If the warrior wants to compete for it, it either needs to be said at the start of the run, or when the item drops.
---
It is not accepted that the warrior should just roll need on it, and any warrior who rolls need without either asking, or waiting to see if the rogue greeded, would be branded a ninja in ANY group I've ever been in.
---
Nah, they are doing it to "Draw out the lvl 60 PVP player for epic world pvp" ... which is strange as most level 60 would probably be in other zones, not a mid-level zone.
---
Well, you wrote 3 whole paragraphs of everything you had to do as a hunter, and you still think the skill cap ins't high?
---
And the fact that hunters have all these options just prove a point that it's indeed a high skill cap class.
---
Again, even if it's an OP class and sometimes you kills some clothies just by casting Multi Shot, it doesn't mean it's an easy to master class. You have lots of options in various situations.
---
You also forgot about some things, like weaving skills between your autoshot timer, using feign death to interrupt casts, kiting in general wich is in itself somewhat of a high skill cap to do properly, etc...
---
The sub is also growing more rapidly lately. We'll be over 70,000 subs by this time tomorrow and at 80,000 subs within 2 weeks at our current rate. If the game doesn't launch for at least 6-8 weeks, we'll definitely be at 100,000 subs minimum.
---
So, your F5 spam isn't alone. You're surrounded by almost 70,000 other refresh spamming nerds (myself included).
---
&gt;  In the end, make the decision as a group.
---
I like this idea the best.  BiS is BiS, even if it's sometimes leather for a warrior. It does suck that this can make it unfair for some class/specs since some will lots of competition for some items while other class/spec won't have any. So it's best that all in a party know what everyone else is there for and if it can potentially be rewarding for all involved. Just battle the RNG for it to drop is enough in my opinion, and would prefer a different party if there is too much competition for what I'm after.
---
You need "a" version.   You can buy retail vanilla.
---
[And this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYZ_cZRieRU)
---
Most the time beta server names are just random placeholders and have like 2-4 servers max
---
Haha I did have a job! 😂😂😂👍 weekends were different, easily 10-12 hrs! Was tough to go cold turkey! 😂👍
---
I played Vanilla from the get go, pretty sure I know what the fuck Im talking about kid
---
XP = (Char Level * 5) + 45, where Char Level = Mob Level
---
XP = (Base XP) * (1 + 0.05 * (Mob Level - Char Level) ), where Mob Level &gt; Char Level
---
XP = (Base XP) * (1 - (Char Level - Mob Level)/ZD )
---
   where Mob Level &lt; Char Level, and Mob Level &gt; Gray Level
---
For some reason I did think you were the OP, my bad.
---
I don't think my posts were that confusing though. I think they will go out of their way to disable cross faction talking.
---
I was getting the impression that you were hoping Blizz would allow it and you just wanted me to confirm that for you, but maybe I got the wrong impression.
---
You’re right, it’s time is a brutal thing
---
You won't need BFA to play classic. So you won't have to pay for those extra expansions if you don't have them/want them.
---
😂😂😂
---
Servers aren't free my guy. Neither are the devs who are working on classic. Don't act like every single dollar is going to retail.
---
FWIW, I played hunter vanilla - wotlk then played a warlock in BFA. If I recall correctly, you literally press one spell over and over again (chaos bolt) in raids in vanilla. It was different in BFA cause affliction is a viable spec so I had some unique rotations. But warlocks are generally well received, even though they dont quite put out the same damage as a mage, get free mounts at level 40, and having a pet by your side helps the leveling process. It's a familiar but also different feeling coming from a hunter background.
---
Correct, it used to be a bug, it was patched before 1.12 and will not work in classic.
---
For streaming? Probably warrior. You'll have 0 downtime for dungeons. Leveling can be a bit rough but if you have enough people watching your stream then i'm sure you can get pocket tanks. Not to mention, at max level if you get decently geared and mess in pvp, it's a joy to watch a warrior + healer combo duo the server.
---
It does affect wand speed. Think it technically affects thrown speed too lmao
---
It was a common issue when I played on Nostalrius as a Shaman Healer, Mages/Warlocks got upset over me rolling for cloth gear.
---
Well excuse me, I was tired of wearing a grey level 17 item in that slot while being level 28, besides I am keeping your ruddy ass alive.
---
I tried to aim for leather, but it was just impossible as the leather gear that I got was all wrong with the stats.
---
Just to add onto this, you won't want barmans shanker if you plan on raiding. It adds a dot that your raid will not want taking up a debuff slot.
---
Hunter and or priest.
---
Most blizz posts have been happening at 9 or 10 AM california time (some exceptions tho).  Most likely if it hasn't happened yet there won't be anything major today.  And I think it's a long weekend so maybe they'll wait until after?   I'm guessing we won't see anything until at least tuesday.  I'd be happy to be wrong though.
---
Technically classic IS free.  As long as you have an active sub to retail
---
Thanks so much for taking the time to reply, this is a huge help. 👍
---
Hi, /u/Gapehorner
---
I'm just sat in front of my computer, grinding MMR in dota. Btw Abaddon pos 5 is sick if anybody cares.
---
I completely forgot about PowerShell.
---
I have forgotten the face of my father.
---
Why are you on /r/wowclassic instead of /r/classicwow ?
---
Just remember to land on your feet/legs, and not on your hands/arms.
---
They have recruitment mondays on this thread where all the guilds comment their information. I think you can probably go through archived / old posts and find them .
---
Hi, /u/MrHiccuped
---
Being in nature so much I bet you come back maiming druid
---
Why would we? BfA sucks
---
&gt;Once they had the r14 weapons
---
r/thathappened
---
This is correct. Do this every raid until you are invited, and then once you are invited you will likely always be invited back.
---
You're welcome and Good luck!
---
wat
---
Wont this area be unreachable with wall climbing disabled?
---
No I just don’t see why they would bother to add a way to do so or patch one out. Like people said there was a time with it in vanilla and a time without and blizzards record shows more of a lack of caring lately to me.
---
nah you're just cheap
---
Oh yeah!  typically I would go back there as a neutral spot so if I logged in and was visible it would be there.
---
Pretty boring though!  It's just a buncha GM avatars standing around!
---
See 10-12 thats more like it lol
---
Most MC pugs I've run with either do gold bid where the gold profit is split among the whole raid at the end or they do main spec over offspec with a +1 and a reset at Rag
---
I’m just saying I’m not rushing to resub with the impending news of possible beta access
---
Why not Windows 7/10?
---
&gt;What more evidence do you need.
---
The existence of Activision.
---
I think Classic will be better than retail and it should actually cost more than retail. Because better product is worth more usually. This logic where you want to pay less for game you actually like doesn't make sense to me.
---
he meant it takes up a small part of your brain, not that standing in the fire didn't matter.
---
Just that there's probably going to be a beta sometime.
---
95% admin tools.
---
In terms of helping players that is where you want to be.  Going in game meant having to put everything else on hold for the most part.
---
Lots of incompatibilities, more importantly, is the amount of glitches and fuck ups someone can cause with old code.
---
Blizzard just win
---
It is a great idea, I bought a refurbished MB Pro 7 years ago and it hasn’t had an issue
---
Same.  I won't level any character that I'm not keeping permanently.  It's too easy to burn out...especially when you're running around The Barrens and Stonetalon Mountains on foot!  Time dilates during those runs, I swear.
---
First a cow dr00d, then an undead priest around January, then a BE pally when TBC drops in a few years, and maybe a cow shaman when WOTLK rolls around.
---
My keyboard has a button to disable it, but I don't really use it because I rarely have an issue accidentally hitting the windows button.
---
&gt; This is my main machine and the only way windows gets into it is into a completely isolated virtual machine.
---
Why is this? I used to have the same 2011 27" and I had 0 issues with dual booting OSX and Windows.
---
I agree here especially about people being broke. People forget in vanilla with the crazy crazy...CRAZY amount of running around almost everyone saves every cent for regular and epic mounts ASAP. Having played on a few private servers from day 1, I can say that almost nothing sells for a good 3 weeks - month. Wands do somewhat sell if fairly priced because casters want them bad. Most materials don't sell as people would rather get to 60 and then power level professions after via a guide as cheaply as possible.
---
Bags are in high demand as well of course but that's about it. In true vanilla before DM is released the best way to get wealth is farming mobs that drop lots of decent selling vendor trash honestly. You make money off selling to vendors not players for some time lol.
---
UBRS is a 15 man dungeon. Everyone hunting TS shoulders (every physical DPS class in the game) will be rolling against other DPS for them.
---
Yeah I’m not. Hence why I send **if** it’s in alpha. Hope we get some news soon!
---
Haha r14 weapons on players with 1/5th the game time experience. May as well of had white items when it came time to PvP against a real vanilla player.
---
What about TMBG up to The Spine?
---
Could you send an automatic request to the WoW client to grab a screenshot and potentially see issues? Or did you identify potential addon related issues by checking what API calls they were making?
---
Why?
---
The logic is I want to pay proportionally to what I will play. And a lot of the cost of the sub fee is to help cash flow for future retail. I just don’t believe we should have to pay for something we won’t use. Plenty of companies offer tiers of service, why not make everyone happy?
---
Alpha and Beta are really just nomenclature for the level of completeness for builds.
---
Beta is usually only one step from a Release Candidate, where as Alpha is anything incomplete.
---
Yup, that's some phase 2 shit
---
Oh yeah!  Most employees have personal accounts they play during off hours on the normal client just like normal players!  
---
In terms of revealing identity, not really.  My irl friends new of course, and I ran a guild and one of the high officers who played with us in previous games knew and that was about it.  My entire guild was obvious outside those few officers, lol.
---
I always liked horde, but my friends rolled ally in vanilla.  We’re going horde this time.  Lok’Tar
---
I have a question for you guys. "Goblin Rocket Boots" are listed as having no requirements on some sources, and to require Engineering 225 to use in others. I think it is more likely that the latter is true (in part because that is how "Gnomish Rocket Boots" are), but do you guys know?
---
168 Hours in a week
---
120 hours = 5 Days played time
---
48 Hours = Hours left in the week not leveling
---
56 Hours a week sleeping if you get 8 hours as you say is possible
---
hitting 60 in a week with 5 days played time is not possible if you want to sleep 8 hours a night and that doesn't account for having a job or stopping to eat.
---
One of my favorite first moment was getting to tank in Molten Core for first time, my first raid. My guild brought me in because they needed another off tank for Executus. I was a casual at the time. 
---
My gear was so incredibly shit that my healer ran out of mana trying to keep me up 😂 We ended up downing the boss for the first time.
---
That started the addiction.
---
Ok and you’re a sap.
---
So there I am, leveling cooking for the first time before we went to raid AQ40. I'm making dragonbreath chili because its orange for me. I discover that when I have the buff on I occasionally breathe fire. THIS IS AWESOME, i think to myself. And keep the buff on throughout our raid. 
---
Finally we get to the wall that has been cockblocking our progression: twin emperors. We had the switches between tanks down but we had difficulty figuring out why there were so many adds. So we began our attempt and I realized that my chili buff had fallen off. I reapplied it and went on doing deeps. Only on this pull, there seemed to be an assload of big adds that swarmed our healers early and wiped the raid. Our raid leader was trying to figure out why we pulled so many and I sheepishly admitted to having this buff on. Raid leader laughs, kicks me from the CTRaid channel (remember that?) and changes the channel name to holdthechiliplease. He says if I can guess the password I can get back in. So I whisper him bootaysucks and the mod lets me back in. He was not hard to figure out.
---
This just isn't how the game works in 2019. Items like Truestrike Shoulders are widely known as being BIS for 3 different classes. All 3 of those classes are allowed to roll on Truestrikes, it's completely kosher.
---
It depends on the game/company.
---
But my guess for WoW is that it'll be like a PTR and it won't carry over.
---
As an orc / human (maybe all races, not positive though) you're better off with gauntlets of annihilation from C'thun. You will be so rage capped from fat crits and high hit % that you'll be heroic striking a lot more, and heroic strike can not glance. At that point the increase in damage from your offhand hits by using edgemasters are going to be minuscule in comparison to the unreal fat static gainz from Gauntlets of Annihilation (*35* str, 1% crit, 1% hit)
---
I thought you said 2 handed dagger, and I was like "maybe for gnomes"
---
Thanks :)
---
The reason that those things have not been included is that you can get them through trading. You don't need Mining to get Arcane Crystals, it just makes it cheaper. If you don't have mining, you can always just buy it from a miner if you need it.
---
Don't argue with the playerbase, take it up to Blizzard who decided to make most Plate/Mail options rather unattractive for DPS classes.
---
If you forced Warriors to only wear plate, then you would be heavily gimping your Fury Warriors and their dps output.
---
Nah, Most services don't do that. Netflix for example don't count how many minutes you use it per month. Everyone pays the same. And that is all cool. If you aren't happy when you can play Classic for same fee i don't think you really waited the game. It is not your business to worry about where your money goes when you pay sub (and you really don't know where your pennies exactly goes).
---
I dunno, I try to keep those 3 things separate. 
---
I dont want any of the sensitive data i work with easilly exploitable by a hacker who got onto my gaming rig and would otherwise steal my wow acct info but--fuck it, now we have bank details to a large corporation.
---
And I dont want to open myself up on my gaming or work rigs to whatever I may be doing on the seedier places on the internet.
---
They arent airgapped systems and a malicious actor could breach them all, but I do what I can to limit exposure.
---
When before my sub ran out, getting the Defias Chestpiece to complete the set! I love it so much, had everything, mask included and I think the Rapier too (but I was much more interested in daggers).
---
I'm saying there's no way multiple of your friends got to rank 14 in vanilla.
---
I'm calling you a liar
---
Yeah, it's been out of print for a long time, and it's got a pretty strong fanbase. I paid $500 for my full set; hunting down the blizzcon card set was a LOT of work.
---
System integrity. I have all of my work (and life) on this machine and although I have backups, getting everything back to working status would cost me a lot of time. I've been using years back Bootcamp and one day I got something under windows (maybe a virus or something else) and it corrupted the partition table and I lost everything. Never again.
---
more than likely being either Albert Einstein or Mandela
---
[deleted]
---
I've never had an issue pressing the Windows key on accident while gaming, but if I did then this is what I'd do. Just have a .reg file and triggers in Task Scheduler that tell it when you want it to run (for example - when you open a certain program). You could always just manually press it too though. Maybe have it pop up and tell you if it's turning it on or off if you go the PowerShell route.
---
Yes, buggy tooltip, the CD shouldn't be there
---
Thank you.
---
If you can get them. By the time I grinded out the linen to make enough greens to get my enchanting up high enough to make the level 5 wand I could have just leveled 2-3 more times and just gotten a quest one. There is one in the barrens I believe from a ratchet quest that is easy to get.
---
If some are up sure, otherwise you'll cruise quicker just pushing forward which at the start is the most important. I've been messing on private servers (without buying it on AH to replicate what it'll be like) and it's never been worth it. This is speaking as a warlock though.
---
Did you read the post?  At the end of vanilla (tbc prepatch) all PvP gear/weap were acquirable with honor points only, no rank required. Literally everyone and their mom had r14 gear and thought they were hot shit.
---
first time we took down rag and raiding ZG. I LOVED ZG.
---
“Most services don’t do that”
---
Let’s just forget that every ISP offers tiers of service. And that’s just one service every person on Reddit has used...
---
"The following is after very limited testing. The formulas here are best guess."
---
probably 4 separate gathering profs to make gold. Ie Skinning, mining, herb and enchant
---
I started at $10 and worked my way up to $15 and benefits over time.  They gave us a few free subscriptions we could use on person/friend accounts.  Lots of swag!  We would get a free copy of all game releases and lots of cool stuff would pop up from time to time.  They also had awards periodically for customer service and I got a couple cool things through that as well!  The break room was legendary!  Highly competitive 4 player trash talking smash bros and foosball were my favs!
---
Well, the blizzard's betas never asked for an active sub
---
How can I download this?? I have a slow connection and would like a head start.
---
Cow. Druid. Moo.
---
/cast innervate
---
I have absolutely no doubt that they are preparing vanilla with the express intent of moving on to Future expansions
---
This is against the game rules but...
---
I was a noob, playing my mate in crossroads and a fellow wow player dueled me and told me what I did wrong. I ended up helping him get the buddy account with me renewing my subscription. 
---
He ended up helping me understand the game and my class. We switched accounts and logged on to each other’s not knowing who each person was (was pretty nervous about it) but he ended up making me macros and switching my keybinds around. 
---
Started to own has I got the hang of it! Ahhhh what a nice guy!
---
Judgment is still one of the best tier sets in the game. Whichever artist came up with it conceptually deserves a raise.
---
Leveling a mage with my friend who played a warlock. Some of the best times.
---
Use a VPN at work and lug in a seperate pc lol. Game Masters are in cubicles dude, can't just hide your laptop when people walk by every time.
---
Yeah, absolutely. I never leveled in Vanilla, only started in BC tho. So I expect to visit more zones I usually had to. Will be interesting.
---
okay? but since when did the needs of others affect the ideal outcome for an individual....
---
The warrior sees two pieces, one is better for him than the other. full stop.
---
The rogue sees two pieces, he can use one and not the other.
---
The warriors needs are not affected at all by what the rogue wants. The fact the rogue cant use the plate the warrior sees as his 2nd best option is immaterial.
---
In 99% of cases, this is a random 5 man. The level to which the rogue is geared has no impact on the warriors odds of success in MC/BWL, which is what he is getting the leather for in the first place. 
---
So again, the best outcome from the rogues perspective is to get the leather, from the warriors perspective its to get the leather. No one cares about the average dps of the 5 man dungeon group that will never form again after the specific run.
---
I might be confusing what changes they made in BC with Vanilla.  While there were things each type made exclusively, I'm struggling to find a BoP one.  I know in BC they expanded it and there were BoP versions of hammers or whatever.  But I can't immediately find a BoP for a Vanilla craft.
---
Agreed. Worry about what you do with the materials at level 60.
---
"Don't argue with the playerbase, take it up with Blizzard".  That's completely not the Classic mentality.
---
I'm not forcing warriors to only wear plate.  I'm asking them to be courteous to rogues and druids before rolling on leather.  I'm asking them to consider the fact that the rogue and druid has no options other than leather.
---
This was common courtesy in 2004, back when the game was about community.
---
For example:https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=10015/truesilver-champion  
---
It has Level 1 Blacksmithing required.  You get the recipie at 260 from the trainer, but then look at:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2674/heavy-sharpening-stone
---
Technically you can make a Truesilver champion before you can make that, if you can somehow learn the recipe.
---
These are just little examples of the trouble of mixing the old and the new datasets from different systems.
---
The level 1 skill thing is from a revamp sometime in the middle of wow's lifespan (Cata I think), where they changed how you level up professions.
---
Ah okay, I thought you were compiling a "Complete List" of exclusive benefits
---
Yup I will 100%. I was afraid like you that it's just nostalgia talking and rose colored glasses of days of yore. I caved and wanted to prep a little bit leveling wise to get ahead of the rush at the start so I started on a private server just to see.
---
I can say personally, the hype is real. I had to forcibly stop at level 30 (yesterday) and play something else or I would have kept going until launch. Not only am I not sick of it but I absolutely can't wait for launch day.
---
Try to take any software from 2005 and run it on Windows 10.
---
There's a good chance there will be issues.
---
Beyond upgrading software dependencies, they've also bringing in admin and anti hack from retail.
---
Ah didn’t know that. Thanks for the info.
---
Just grab duo Skinning and one goes Herbalism the other goes Mining. You'll have plenty of time to share skinning skill-ups and mining and herbalism.ahouldnt be too bad to keep up to date :)
---
And there is plenty or businesses that don't offer as we know. And if you think in business money what you pay will stay in the maintaining &amp; development of that specific service and not development of the company and other services you need to look again how stuff works.
---
Not sure if I'm too late to the party, but back in TBC we had a GM visit Goldshire on our server. He did silly stuff like make people really big or really small, turned people in to different mobs. Have you done something similar back then? Did Blizzard encourage GMs to do this every now and then?
---
This is the best on the web so far: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=looking%20for%20group%20monday&amp;restrict\_sr=1&amp;sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=looking%20for%20group%20monday&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new)
---
The other nice this about doing all the gathering profs is that if you want to craft a certain item before 60 just ask another play to do it for you to save you time from leveling up that prof and just tip them
---
Because they had to rebuild the entire game from the ground up.  The client, database structure, and the code that the entire game runs on.  The original 15-16 year old code was a antique by modern coding standards and it would never integrate with battle.net.
---
Getting through all of Scarlet Monastery with two of my friends.
---
We loved 3-manning dungeons. Druid, Paladin, and Priest. We pretty much specced for survivability, and our roles would constantly shift depending on what we were fighting. We really enjoyed slowly leveling up, preparing for dungeons, making potions and new gear beforehand, all that stuff.
---
Got through the first three sections pretty well. It was slow going, had the occasional death, but no wipes. Then we get to the Cathedral, a bit under leveled. It was absolute chaos. We were changing roles every two seconds, everybody was healing everybody, pretty sure the Priest was tanking at one point. Druid was sneaking around marking enemies, dual tanking with the Paladin at a few points.
---
My god. It was freaking nuts. Pretty sure we blacked out and literally turned into our characters at one point, but we did it.
---
Yeah, that is pretty interesting. I think that is bound to be changed.
---
If you did dungeons with associated quests you hadn't.
---
There is no such thing as a "random 5 man" in classic.  Every group is hand-picked.  The warrior in this case would be sacrificing his reputation to everyone in the rogue's friends and guild list in order to get that item.
---
i concur
---
Hi, /u/888Kraken888
---
Logitech G15 was baaaaaaaller
---
I mean it does matter. If everyone is logged into to "prep for launch" then no one is breaking the game and submitting reports...its a pretty simple concept.   
---
Further, a bug tester is also on the server causing stress and interacting with others. There is no situation in which someone logged into a beta for personal data gathering is preferable to someone there to test. You can make the argument its negligible to the entire exercise for a few people to do that--and i'd agree. But it is still a less than ideal use of the beta.
---
Oops ran out of arrows.
---
Does anyone have any meat? My pet is about to abandon me.
---
Brb gotta repair my bow.
---
Didnt mean to multishot the sheep.
---
I forgot that hunters cant use maces, sorry (lol vendor spec)
---
...doesnt use aspect of the pact to run back to boss w/ group
---
...doesnt feign death to re-trap
---
etc etc etc. I cant wait
---
You can get a sub for $12/month. With 32% dollar inflation since 2004, that's equivalent to paying $9/month in 2004.
---
If you can't afford that, then you are either poor (or cheap) and should  be spending your MMO time at a job.
---
You're welcome for the life advice.
---
How do you get invited?
---
30mg.. those are rookie numbers
---
No he wouldnt. It is beyond known that warriors go after leather in 5 mans. The rogue crying would be the more chastized figure in this case.
---
And most groups are "hand picked" by the first 4 people to whisper the group leader.
---
Pretty much the same thing as the normal one.  If I recall correctly it had a command prompt you could pull up for GM commands and otherwise was pretty much the same.  
---
The more interesting stuff was in how you could manipulate things.  Running super high speed and through stuff was kind of a trip, as was recovering players who were floating somewhere in the either.  Sometimes you would go mega fast speed and run straight up and never find anything and wonder how they even got there in the first place, lol.
---
This. If those players are anything to go by, I'll keep the Rogues out of our group.
---
Don't really want to deal with the Drama BS just because snowflakes don't understand how itemization works in Vanilla WoW.
---
Can't wait to see the "I can't find a group" posts if they continue with that kind of mentality.
---
Undead warlock on a pvp server.
---
Was obsessed with pvp when original vanilla came out up until Cata. Not as into it as I used to be but imo it wouldn't be the same now experiencing tarren mill and world pvp like it used to be. That crazy uneasiness of running into the opposite faction questing on your mobs and seeing if they would go for you, or act friendly until you screwed up / backup arrived heh.
---
Indeed I am :)
---
Being able to mine Arcane Crystals is definitely a benefit, but since you can also buy Arcane Crystals at the AH, I don't see it as exclusive. If you can get something by throwing gold at it, it isn't exclusive.
---
okej stop dots
---
Now hit it very hard.
---
And very fast.
---
Lee, run to the center!
---
didn't it change and become easy to get?
---
Idk really. I just feel it and it's a class I've really neglected ever since I've started playing this game as a kid in vanilla. I feel so hyped that I get to enjoy this game again and actually experience the end game and know what I'm doing. As a kid I didnt.
---
Wat
---
I did that hahaha. I was like 11 years old. Little level 25 rogue and I tried to say I dropped my Krol blade. I then went on to explain that I had cancer and the GM still didn't budge. God what a ridiculous thing. That GM had a lot of patience with me. Definitely did not get a free Krol blade though.
---
Why wouldn’t you want a crafting profession?
---
Mythologies are myths and stories.   
---
Eye witnesses make it history and fact.
---
Ok and you're a jew.
---
If you read any of this it’s not that I can’t afford it. It’s the principle of having to pay for services I won’t use.
---
Plenty of companies offer tiers of service, like an ISP for example—you can choose how good of a service you want to pay for.
---
Thanks for being another dick in the thread. Have a wonderful day.
---
If you do roll alliance, I strongly recommend Dwarf Priest. Stoneform is amazing as is fear ward. PLUS, they are smaller which makes using terrain to your advantage super easy. I am forced into rolling Horde this time around as the population appears to be about 70/30 Alliance players versus horde.
---
Horde are just so damn ugly... My wife is struggling to figure out what she wants to play because they are so ugly...
---
Please add nsfw tag ... triggered
---
Lechaim!
---
This is super old but whatever. There was a really good ele shaman named Sham who has a pvp vid you can look up, and he played 23/7/21 (pre 1.12 but still viable if you ask Focused on dagger melee with WF and instant casts and outmaneuvering, no hard casting any LB/CL was necessary with the build because you stayed mobile. A 1 sec ghost wolf made it easier to close distance or escape.
---

I'm leaning towards treating both those cooldowns and the Salt Shaker the same way I am treating the Steel Weapon Chain - which is to exclude them. What they produce can be traded for, so they aren't exclusive the way I see it, even if they nominally require a profession to use.
---
Haha I used to play dota everyday and Abba was one of my favourites (though pos 2 or 4). I'm using my 3 months away to quit dota permanently. That shit is like a drug. It's an unbelievable game, but it brings me more stress and anger than happiness, so I'm done with it.
---
&gt; Go into Enemy controlled territory.
---
Im fairly sure that also includes if you run too close to an enemy outpost (quest hub, flight master, etc) and the NPCs attack you (aka, if you get too close).  From what i remember theres also some random NPCs for the other faction out in the world that will do that, not just at major quest hubs.
---
Yeah patch before TBC launch they allowed everyone to get it basically
---
Right, so our understanding of the definition is the same.  
---
  Well, the thing about druids is that even though they have various of options in terms of shapeshifting, healing and whatnot, they have very limited options to actually control any pvp situation unlike other classes such as mages and rogues. Mages and rogues have very strong cooldowns (blind, prep and coldsnap) and lots slows, snares and CCs which allow them, regardless of how skilled they are, to have control over their fights. Now, as you know, when a class has high skill cap it means that "skillcapped" players can utilize these cooldowns etc. way further than the average-skilled players. - Ultimately allowing them to win 1vX fights, or completely outplay another player of the same class. So if we compare for example a Rogue and a Feral druid and we pretend that the players are skillcapped then, because the rogue has way stronger cooldowns and CC he is more likely to win for example in a 1v2 scenario than the feral druid. In this case the rogue has a higher skill cap than the feral druid.  
---
  If we were to look at something else like flag carrying in WSG, then druids clearly have a lot higher skill cap than any other class because of their high mobility and survivability.  
---
  Regarding skill floor then, again, druids have a really high skill floor in PvP because it's hard to really succeed (in solo play that is). But if we look at rogues and mages; they have low skill floor because even bad players can manage just fine with these classes in pvp solo play.

The beauty of vanilla was it wasn't about dps meters. It wasn't OMG i'm special snowflake enhance shaman I should be viable dps like pure dps! (sorry shaman just tossing something random out there). Every class and spec pretty much has uses that were unique and sought after.
---
Not all healers had a battle rez, that was druid only but druids weren't the best healers. They also had innervate which was so big.Enhance shaman had crappy dps, but were wanted for dps heavy groups to give them windfury etc. 
---
Basically play what you want and have fun. If you do your homework and be prepared then any raiding guild will take you. The only downside is I guess a class that's heavily played it'll be tougher. At launch something like 40% of people are going warriors. Of them probably less then 3% will make 60, and of that less then 1% will be decent to great.
---
No goons are people who are members of the SomethingAwful forums, so the goon guilds are in most games.
---
aside from fixing exploits and bugs.. the old client didn't mesh with their internal services.. like how authentication works.. how their customer support ticket systems work.. how their server structure is setup.. better supporting modern hardware and accessibility (like color blind mode).. some of the "side effects" are bnet chat and such but still a lot on the other side we don't see that would need to be redone so no real way to just load it up and go.

Hi, /u/hoboh1
---
Basic idea is that crafting profs are time/gold sinks, so it is more efficient to just gather while leveling and sell for gold, get your mounts, etc. also if you find a crafting prof leveling guide, they usually give you the total mats you’ll need of each, so you just keep what you need and sell the rest, then power level the crafting prof once you hit 60.
---
Personally, I’m a filthy casual, and alway pair a gathering and crafting prof and poke around at them along the way. Part of the fun for me is wearing the ugly green chainmail set that I made. Using bags I crafted on my tailor alt. But that’s a personal preference.
---
Honestly this just goes to show how important and significant engineering is for pretty much all parts of the game. So many uses for such little effort.

&gt;If you leave them alone and hope that they're nice and leave you alone, you're going to have a bad time. They will wait til the have the advantage then gank you anyways.
---
honestly, i don't remember how true this was in retail vanilla, but on private servers (with the huge pop, supposed shittier community and more hardcore players), 90% of the time when you run into an opposite faction player, both of you kinda just /wave or ignore each other and nothing happens. Very rare that I leave someone alone only for them to turn around later and gank me. It does happen certainly, but in my experience, rarely.
---
Indeed, this says absolutely nothing about oceanic servers. I thought everyone had realized by now that tips talks a lot about things he doesn't fully understand.
---
This is a tough one because I was still a pretty low tier GM all things considered.  Here is what I saw from my perspective.
---
From the moment I got there till the day I left the company one thing that was always an issue was space.  We could never, no matter what we did, seem to get enough work stations for how fast things grew.  My first month there I spent more than a few days waiting for people to leave a work station before I could even start.  Later CS split into their own building and it was filled to the brim within a month.  Later they splintered half of the CS to Austin, Irvine was still packed.  We moved to Campus and it was full immediately.
---
Without knowledge of what the higher ups saw I'm not surprised they tried out tactics other than throwing more people at the situation.  Then there were some situations, like harassment issues, where I can see how they might view an interaction as not necessary.  It wasn't uncommon for the person doing the reporting to more or less blow me off when I messaged them.  "Yeah whatever, just handle it."  Not everyone was like that but 95% of those (which also happened to be the most common ticket)  were just me saying.  'Hi, we'll handle it appropriately, anything else I can help you with?  ok, bye!'  
---
Some issues do require the human touch though and I hope that isn't lost.  I haven't played WoW since WOTLK, so I am not even sure I would recognize the game at this point.  I seems like they are trying to fix the issues that feel like an interruption quicker, and leave the CS more time to handle the issues that require a more human touch and if that is the case, it makes sense to me.
---
So original. Some may even say brendanoriginal.

This makes me so happy.

---
Yeah, if even 25% of engineering items are useful, that is still more than all the exclusives the other primary professions have put together.

My plan for Classic is to have a hunter main with engineering. It isn't just a great profession, but I think it fits the class as well.

---
ok but im interested in vanilla, what about the lowest settings?
---
Weather effects :(
---
No problem.
---
Crafting professions are generally money sinks without enough benefit to offset the cost when leveling.  Instead of using the materials you gather you can just sell them (either on the AH or to a vendor) and use that money to buy gear upgrades and consumables when needed.  That's not to mention the additional costs associated with crafting like paying for training and trade supplies like thread and vials.
---
My understanding of skill cap and skill floor is:  
---
  A skill cap is what a class can do when it is being played to its fullest potential.  
---
  A skill floor is the minimum skill required for a class to succeed.  
---
  I explained why I think druid skill cap is low in a comment above (same thread). But to make it short; druids can't control any pvp situation as good as other high skill cap classes such as mages and rogues. Say you have a rogue and feral druid who are both skill capped. In any 1vX scenario the druid are more likely to get shat on than the rogue because the rogue has better options to control the fight to their favor (they got stronger CDs, hard crowd controls and slows).
---
Stuff has been data mined.
---
so no, classic weather effects ? we get the new shitty ones ?
---
Yeah I had always been on PVP before but I don't have the time to be camped or camp others anymore.
---
Not offended in slightest. It’s been fun replying to all the hateful people that get their panties in a twist when someone wants to have discourse.
---
Dat moose knuckle tho...
---
Wait wrong sub.
---
In all seriousness though every t2 set is awesome imo.
---
Rogue in pve was a very easy and simple rotation. Then again most classes were I guess.
---
PVP all I played was rogue from original launch until the end of TBC. I never really considered it difficult, but then again back then there wasn't diminishing returns on stuns. I quickly found ways to 100&gt;0 stunlock a lot of classes if it was purely 1v1 situations and it was hella easy to do. If they trinketed you could blind and reset.
---
I guess we'll have to see if DR is in place or not. That certainly changed a lot for many classes. Even locks with their endless fear bombing.
---
just fuck me up now

how do you figure?

Is it a bigger upgrade for the rogue or the druid than for you?  If the answer is yes, then don't.

blizzard hasnt shared anything new
---
So why have caps at all--beyond server community things--if the server is more or less superficial, as we, on retail, appear to all play on the same server dispersed among different nodes or whatever. 
---
Why not just let all people who want to roll on Classic Server 17A play on 17A. If servers are built like todays retail for classic, it appears there is no limit, as you can shard people onto another server with their information routing through the former. 
---
I guess then, since classic is all about concurrent itd be 1 shard for all of 17A--which must have an approachable limit. 
---
Quite a difficult nut. I think the "best" solution is a queue. But that pisses users off. A queue makes it so the logged in experience never dips below a certain satisfaction level. 
---
Then there is the question of whether this tourism effect is even real. Blizzard saw 70-90% concurrency that first holiday season 2004. With as big as wow is now, if even just 5% of players of at least 100,000,000 who've played the game at some point showed up for classic thats--what 10 times?!--more than those who had purchased the game by 1/1/5. So if a similar scale to the launch, servers should be well filled up.
---
Right I forgot disagreeing and hateful are the same thing my b.
---
I’m under the impression GM’s work from home. Does Blizzard rent out office space for GM positions?
---
Agreed, I just love running around with the moose antlers. Nothing screams druid more than seeing the moose druid running around.
---
Yeah.
---
Now we can see why rule 5 is a thing.
---
Ohh you had to goto a physical location? Could you work from home?
---
The number of times I’ve seen it bug on private servers... so frustrating
---
I use two screens.  In some games I need to Alt-Tab to access the 2nd screen.  In some games Ive set it up in "windowed" mode or something like that.  I can then move the mouse to the other screen while in game, but I can see the window bar around the game, and the FPS is MUCH lower.  
---
The FPS drop is what sucks.  Anyone have a solution for this?  Thanks.
---

---
In any group I've ever been in, if the warrior rolled without asking first, he'd be asked to stop.  If he did it again, he'd be kicked.
---
And yes, they are picked that way.  But there is also that level of discretion of "I recognize that name and he's not going", or if the person can even see your advertisement because they're on ignore.
---
Um take this down.
---
To some extent you can't outlive their nukes unless you outgear them. All of the high burst specs like Arms Warrior, Destruction Warlock, Marksman Hunter, Ele/Resto Shaman or the Mage class are relied on for burst precisely because they're so effective.
---
The most you can do to help mitigate damage is use greater [school] absorption potions, wear various defensive items like arena master, or straight up prevent them from bursting/ccing you using rocket helm and skull of impending doom.
---
At the end of the day there will be times when you don't have enough defensive cooldowns to straight up tank something unless you're a druid in bear form with barkskin, or a paladin with divine shield.
---
This is a world of meat and bone, wood and stone. Magic belongs in the game.
---
&gt;  It’s the principle of having to pay for services I won’t use. 
---
Then don't pay! The only person being a dick is the person who thinks a corporation should set its prices according to their personal whims. The reality is that you CAN afford it and Blizzard knows this, so your complaint will go nowhere.
---
Make a cost/value determination. Then decide whether to purchase a product or not. If you choose not to, then move on to something that you can afford that will give you enjoyment. That's called voting with your wallet. It's an important life lesson to learn early on.
---

Notice the classic button on the bottom left next to recommended
---
Smart!
---
We are in alpha.
---
If your aim is just to level fast I'd probably just take double skinning for vendoring. Anything else will just slow you down.  
---
If you aren't too worried about speed and do want to take your time with levelling professions you'd probably go herb/alch and mining/BS. That would give you a fair bit of stuff that would help both of you as you level.
---
Just calm down and have a nice long watch of this:

I like autohotley too.  This is handy for Canadian keyboards with split shift keys and I also use it for a single fn hotkey that closes the current window on my Lenovo laptop.
---
Always on full blast, thus no slider needed. ^^^^hopefully
---
They need to balance on that tightrope all the way to the customers bank account.
---
Even in TBC. I remember being i shattrath (or however it's spelled) and a GM turned me into a Sheep and made huuuuuuge. He spent like 10-15 tranforming to weird things and teleporting me around. I saw GM's as some kind of god back then, good times.
---
Did ya see the “Classic” settings button?
---
&gt; Well, you wrote 3 whole paragraphs of everything you had to do as a hunter, and you still think the skill cap isn't high? 
---
I think it's lower than many other classes, let's say.
---
&gt; I aggree with you. You can fuck up a lot as a hunter and still win some fights. But again, it has nothing to do with skill cap, it has to do with balance and power. 
---
Yeah well, then I'm not sure what skillcap is. You're right, Hunters have more various optimizable spells than probably any other class in Vanilla. But in reality, switching between Hawk and Monkey aspects won't change much in a fight. As a Druid, I often couldn't even use Faerie Fire when playing against rogues/War in duels for a good chunk of the fight because I couldn't afford to waste a global cooldown or I would loose ! Having to optimize things like Global CD to even win a fight is imo way more skill requiring than having relatively unoticeable abilities.
---
Playing a healing priest / Druid / Warlock in BGs felt as way more punishing than playing a Hunter, because any mistake would mean my death.  Hunter was pretty easy. Then again, yeah, if you only mean skillcap as optimizing gameplay, then Hunters might aswell be the highest ranked, you're right ; but the hardest to make proper use of in PvP, definitely not.
---
I probably wont use that, but its awesome that they put it in!
---
im not so sure weather effect would be there, i think the "downgrade" settings would be there
---
Autohotkey - its brilliant
---
I remember thinking that I was just THAT good (didn't even know what patch notes were back then because I was too young to understand that games received updates) because I could buy r14 before TBC.
---
Then I saw everyone else with them and I realized I was , in fact, still shit at the game.
---
On retail theres a slider/option for 'max background fps'.  I think by default its set to 30.   You can either move the slider/put in a number, or ....i forget exactly...its either to turn it off or set it to 'max' or something like that.
---
Pretty sure its under 'Advanced'
---
Players used to get stuck under the world all the time for various reasons and generally you could see the ground from where they were stuck run up real quick and put them in a spot relatively close to where they started.  
---
Sometimes they are places that are so far from the map you can't find anything in any direct even at max speed.  Truly lost in the either.  Generally you had to have those ones logged out and move them to a major city.
---
We can only hope
---
racials, I've been a, dirty min maxer as long as I can remember
---
Can you change the refresh rate?
---
i agree, most of us want true night and classic weather :)
---
I assume this is only showing 2K as the max res because thats what the persons monitor is.  We'll have 4K support as well, right?
---
You know, I think that thought every other day in Dota. Late last week going into this week I was riding high off of a big win streak, and then on Tuesday everything seemingly went against me as I got unlucky and matched with leavers and griefers all day. That immediately brought me back down and made me almost depressed lol.
---
Dota is a truly a love/hate relationship. The amount of anguish, rage, stress and hatred I've felt while playing that game is only just barely outweighed by the highs of winning.
---
I've concluded that Dota isn't really worthwhile though. WoW was always my main game between 2005-2011 and it'll be my main game once more as soon as Classic comes out.
---

---
Is there a big demand for dark iron ore/bars early on from those Thorium recipes?
---
Haha all good.  The general attitude was always we hoped you guys would learn from it and not continue to do it!
---
That is surprising to me. I'd have thought summer would have summer solstice smack in the middle of it, not as it's 1st day. Do you have some sauce?
---
First off, it works on Pservers on 1.12, 
---
However, you will be able to tell on your weapon speed in your stats tab. 
---
So it should, but it might not in classic as apparently many things will differ and this might be one.
---
Ahh back when classic had blood elves
---
Yeah I’m a dick for hoping Blizzard would adopt a very common pricing scheme called tiered pricing. When every ISP in the US does this, it’s a valid pricing model I could expect Blizzard to employ. You act like this is a one-off in the economy... it’s not.
---
Even if it did work dont you lose a whole bag slot to equip a quiver? I dont think 10% faster wands is worth having over 10 extra bag slots.

For some reason I always thought of a crab claw
---
Still no weather intensity slider has me worried!
---
&gt; druids can't control any pvp situation as good as other high skill cap classes such as mages and rogues. 
---
Certainly, and funnily enough this is more of an arena setting reasonning, but they have a lot of mobility, timing for shapeshifting, mitigating damage taken by shapeshifting, mana management going on. They demand different a type of skill than Mages and Rogues, that's certain. Flag carying is a thing of its own, and so is playing balance/Feral hybrid. It's really a matter of perspective in the end I guess.
---
Because I want to play the beta and classic and you need to sub for both. Plus I can fill some time with a bit of the new content in BFA
---
Thanks for keeping us updated guys, that's sweet!

ok but now your post is implying that they have more than one screenshot
---
What? This is a real problem that people have?
---
Let’s hope not!
---
Roll PvE. It literally gets rid of all the frustrations from PvP, but keeps all the good things (unless you're a griefer). It's incredibly easy to instigate mass wpvp on a PvE server (unless you're going for Rank 14, but nobody going for rank 14 will participate in mass wpvp anyway). On top of that, YOU get to decide when you want to allow people to try and gank you. Not in the mood? Don't turn on the pvp toggle.
---
The dictionary, google, about to experience my 31st summer so I think I would know when it starts by now, lol.  
---
Yeah seasonal definitions are for sure a bit weird, but they always come after their named solar transitions. For example spring is the time between the spring equinox and the summer solstice.
---
 [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/summer](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/summer)   
---
Should be noted that a lot of people use summer colloquially as relating to the 'hot part of the year' which sometimes could include more of the actual springtime and less of the end of the actual summer.
---
Not entirely sure if having the NPC's attack you would cause flagging. Definitely if you then attack them, but as I mentioned, unsure if you simply run away.
---
^(Thank god. You guys play on potato setting if you like, Im riding ultra all the way to the bank.)
---
I need that heavy ass rain
---
I think it's possible, not 100% sure but I would say probably.
---
Players would definitely report kiting the World bosses around, but it sorta hit a gray area on how it violated policy, at least early on.  I am sure the policy developed over time.
---
Even if the GM wasn't gonna note your account with anything, they generally would have sent you a tell and asked you to stop.  Why they wouldn't do that is the only part that makes me question if a GM did it.
---
I'm an old school vanilla player and i've got to say despite you often mentioning that you lack a lot of the detailed knowledge of vanilla, I still very much prefer your style of interviews and questions. Instead of having someone else ask super super technical questions for a niche audience. 
---
I absolutely loved the interview, but I'm not sure how many people are interested to know about 'fire rogues' and if Kevin knew about stat changes to a set 18 years ago affecting mp5 for late game clothadins.
---
That's only a minor gripe. I love all the content you create and the work you put into this podcast. As well as your company hosts enthusiasm. It is infectious.
---
I think my hype for SC2 and D3 were higher. I also think that currently I'm more hyped for Cyberpunk 2077, though that one is still farther off so it keeps the hype down.
---
There is a Classic button in the options for just that.
---
In vanilla WoW, open world PvP happened on PvE servers too. Admittedly without the amazing exhilaration of having your important end game quests and profession gathering set back by months because of constant camping.
---
Not to preserve, to give us that experience again. Look 5-6 years into the future. They will need to do something to keep the player base.
---
New content that should have been in vanilla is a good starting point.
---
In any group I've ever been in, since pservers started, back with Scriptcraft (being the first i remember which wasnt god awful) its been known dps warriors would be rolling on the known few pieces of mail and leather--things like them shoulders in UBRS or the mail chest in BRD \*shrug\*.
---
That said, DPS warriors shouldnt even be a thing outside raids and UBRS (for group pve). If the DPS warrior specs tanking and runs the group--and especially if he is horde--he can engineer the group to be absolutely no loot competition for himself on dps or tanking gear.
---
It also gets more people tanking which breeds more groups, which breeds more loot. 
---
To that end, I never let dps warriors join my 5 man groups, whether Im the prot warrior putting it together or the mage/priest putting it together, it just doesn't make sense. The utility of a dps warrior is that he can tank...
---
I need classic wow in braille
---
I mean the og classic client from 2006 supports it. I've played on vanilla private servers with 4k resolution.
---
Yeah, World of Warcraft is a very unique product in that it's popularity allowed it to do things other games couldn't.  Being able to offer the players a great service they could rely on was important to Blizzard and they viewed the GM squad as a huge part of that I felt.
---
I think it really all goes back to the integrity of the game.  This was a huge deal to them and they wanted the players to feel that as well.  The GMs were the first level of Blizzard that most players were going to interact with, that interaction was important to them as a company and as an extension, us as GMs.
---
Click on the "Classic" button.
---
There's none that I can think of, the differences between top and bottom race/class comboes is not as big as you might think.
---
Class/specs combo? now thats another story. From what I know the least desirable specs (for PvE content) would be non-holy pally, oomkins, B(ad)M(anner) hunters, maybe arms warrior(not sure about this one). As far as PvP goes Im not an expert, others will comment on that(any on any mistakes I made on the PvE part :&gt; )
---
The exclusivity of benefits that specific professions helps make them valuable.  Players choose to get the specific advantages which makes their character unique and adds player agency.
---
That was a bug in nost, an a lot of pservers that have copied their code have had the same problem. It's from old iterations of MaNGOS, but newer versions have patched it. Just because it's on pservers does not mean it's classic or what worked in 1.12, and every time I've ever seen that brought up people have been calling it a bug and said it wasn't like that in 1.12.
---
It easily is for me. No hyperbole, Vanilla WoW is my favorite game of all time by far.
---
in short - yes :)  
---
I think my hype primarily is due to the memories that I have from playing Vanilla. I will enjoy the game (compared to retail) so much more due to the social aspect of it.
---
Alliance

Straw Man
---
&gt; A straw man is a form of argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent.
---
Half Life 3 if it ever comes out
---
It seems what you are refering to is the astronomical definition of summer. That's a pretty good definition, just I would be careful about claiming that no other definition could hold merrit.
---
My first ever character was a troll rogue. I was in the barrens finding my own business when some alliance chump comes outta nowhere and tries to gank me. I don't know how I didn't immediately die, but then my saving grace comes in. This decked out Orc Warrior riding on the Zulian tiger comes in, destroys the dude and to top it all off bandages me back up. It was the most awe-inspiring moment of my entire WoW career. I fell in love that day.
---
WCIII is super legit.
---
I'm more hype for Star Citizen honestly. I've always loved MMO's since I first played EQ, and Star Citizen seems like it has the potential to be the first true "Next Gen" mmo to me. Hopefully it comes together. 
---
I know there are others like Elite Dangerous that are similar to Star Citizen, but I don't think anything is anywhere near as ambitious as Star Citizen. I've been carrying that hype for years now.
---
That being said, I'm definitely in the "I want to know the release date to plan vacation time" camp. I'm ready to raid MC.
---
Whatever excuse they give, all they are doing is wasting everyone’s time
---
You'll notice.
---
Race: Female Dorf... and Tauren...but ONLY cus they are so large that it feels like they are running in slowmotion :( 
---
Class: Never gonna play a Hunter.... i can barely feed myself - not gonna keep a random owl fed as well :D
---
Server first vael, my buddy battlelight was the last one alive. Vael at 1%, pally bubble then hammer of wrath for the kill.
---
I was in Burning Steppes mining, and out of nowhere comes this Night Elf warrior to fight me. I'm pumped cause I love world PvP and I'm always ready for it. I notice his guild name is &lt;and Four Rogues&gt;, and without missing a beat 4 fucking rogues all cheapshot/ambush me all together and I go down like a sack of potatoes. At that point I had my hands off my keyboard just laughing.
---
Between that and my guild getting the server first Nefarian kill.
---
144Hz is noticed as soon as you move your mouse in desktop... 60Hz is trash even in WoW, it feels like 30 fps when you switch from 144 to 60.
---
Definitely worth it.
---
Yeah, too obvious...
---
So you think when people are referring to the season of summer they aren't referring to the astronomical definition?  Google 'start of summer' and it will say June 21st, which is the summer solstice.  That's how summer is defined.  Like I said people also use it to refer to the hot part of the year.
---
best news I've heard! love that classic login screen!
---
Hitting 315 shadow resistance on my warlock and taking on Vek'nilash(?) in Ahn’Qiraj. I even got to use Curse of Doom if I remember correctly.  
---
Good times indeed.
---
I really fucking hope the weather effects, day and night are the way they were.
---
Gnome anything.
---
/whoosh
---
So your hoping that they lower the price of the subscription from $15 to what? Currently people are paying $15 per month for retail servers, once Classic is out they will continue to pay the same fee and have access to additional servers.
---
What price would make you happy? $10 and only access to classic servers? So that the people that pay both have to pay a double subscription?
---
Nope! I never saw a players screen unless they sent a screen shot, and even then we didn't take screen shots as evidence, but we may use them to help us solve something like in the case of a bug report.
---
I don't recall exactly if our UI showed which Add Ons but I am 99% sure it didn't.  What I do remember is having to ask people if they were running any and generally asking them to disable them if we couldn't reach a solution with them on.
---
Add Ons were trouble makers.  At the same time I got it, I was using a bunch when I played at home too.  The main difference is I knew how to solve all the games problems, and when the Add On was the problem and just cut it loose.
---
Question will addons work on classic client?  I spent longer then I want to admit making ev ui look how I wanted?
---
Probably. The one that comes close though would be ESO. My friends and I were so hyped for that game from the time it was announced. We all played Beta, bought the Collectors Edition, played from launch, etc.. But it was so buggy in the early days it honestly spoiled it. I personally still think the solo play is slightly better in that game, but nothing beats WoW overall. Been consuming all the podcasts/videos/threads...
---
My first talent point; hooked. So many possibilities!
---
Tauren rogues 
---
Ever seen one?
---
Can you image your guilds MT as a Female Dwarf Warrior? 😂
---
Modern client does indeed support 4k. I use a 4k screen with no issues. Same on pservers for that matter
---
Very cool, but I noticed you don't include skills granted by quests such as druid bear form and warlock summons.
---
I know perfectly well why some people like it when professions have exclusive benefits. I just have a different preference, and a different idea of what professions should be.
---
with display-port cable ? any special one ?
---
Name checks out
---
Can’t wait to roam azeroth as a monk when classic comes out :) prob belf or human

This is awesome, thanks a lot!

Na, Oblivion! 20.03.2006 never forget!
---
I didn't do anything like that, as I believe those were typically Senior or Lead GMs.  Sometimes we would show off a bit to players but in general most GMs were battling the ticket queue, and we were trying to help as many players as we could.
---
Please tell me where tiered pricing is common in video games i'd love to know.

Private servers usually reset, allowing progression to cycle.

Female Troll Shadow Priest here.
---
God bless man, that’s awesome.

&gt; sorry rogues really need that Hit

You can get shoulders with +2% hit from a quest. TS give 24 Attack Power extra.
---
God I hate that dress so god damn much.
---
This and FF7 remake, I'm a sucker for nostalgia
---
Do you know a GM whos little bro played on burning blade-US? Dude was a euro wow GM
---
So... they are the very best rogues ever then?
---
It would to me. 100% normal damage * 1.25 damage from wand spec * 1.10 speed from quiver = 1.375 or rather: 37.5% DPS increase. That's pretty nifty. Can you imagine playing any other class and all you have to do to get a 37.5% DPS increase with your auto attacks is 5 talents points and 40 copper? (even though it won't work that way in Classic with no bonus from quiver for wand)
---
Not lower the subscription. Create a second, singular, sub that’s just for classic content. Yes $7-10 for classic (tier 1) or $15 for both (tier 2). All I’m asking for is a smaller sub fee for only classic, the original $15 for both still stays in tact.
---
As mentioned in OP and other comments, I don’t play retail and have no intention to ever. So the value for me is not $15 for both classic and retail, it’s $15 for classic as that’s the service I will use. Most everyone in this thread plays retail and doesn’t understand why I wouldn’t want to pay $15 for just classic. I understand it’s an amazing value if you already play retail or may play it. But for those that just want classic, it sucks to have to basically pay for retail when I won’t use it. Other companies offer tiered pricing models for different level of service. It would be cool if Blizzard did the same.
---
Sure, I mean I get what you are saying, but to me those things just mean that druids have a high skill floor, not a high skill cap.   Because even if you master those things to the point where you are literally a skillcapped druid player, an above-average skilled mage or rogue player would still be able to handle any pvp situation just as good as the skillcapped druid, if not better.
---
I just mentioned flag carrying because thats a part of the game where druid really shines and because druid skill cap in that case is totally different.
---
Don’t think it matters that much. The game doesn’t require you to have lightening reflexes. Playing on a 144 won’t make any difference
---
&gt;er versions have patched it. Just because it's on pservers does not mean it's classic or what worked in 1.12, and every time I've ever seen that brought up people have been calling it a bug and said it wasn't like that in 1.12.
---
Well maybe, I don't pretend to know the in depth source code that these pservers run off of but, i still would expect it to work for two reasons.
---
1)The wording of the quiver - ranged attack speed. Implies it should work with wands, a ranged weapon.
---
2)Status quo as again all the pservers I have tried work on 1.12 but maybe it fucked up as you say. 
---
Guess it doesn't really matter much, but hopefully it's intentional. That old kind of shit was what made wow cool.
---
My favorite thing was being a dwarf priest and dueling horde outside the summon stone for BRD, I'd mind control them off the edge into the lava. Good times lol
---
I’m starting my PGY-2 year in a couple months and blocked off some vacation time in August for Classic. Glad I’m not the only one planning around it lol
---
yeah i was thinking about this also, but what would be the diffrence ? i would see the death coil better to reflect it ?
---
Profession tools with no other use:
---
Enchanting rods are CBoP as well
---
*Runed Copper Rod CBoP (Enchanting 1)
---
*Runed Silver Rod CBoP (Enchanting 115 (?))
---
*Runed Golden Rod CBoP (Enchanting 160 (?))
---
*Runed Truesilver Rod CBoP (Enchanting 205 (?))
---
*Runed Arcanite Rod CBoP (Enchanting 290)
---
Hemo still isn't at 46.
---
I would be hyped for Bannerlord.
---
If I ever thought it would come out in my lifetime.
---
 It would to me. 100% normal damage \* 1.25 damage from wand spec \* 1.10 speed from quiver = 1.375 or rather: 37.5% DPS increase. That's pretty nifty. Can you imagine playing any other class and all you have to do to get a 37.5% DPS increase with your auto attacks is 5 talents points and 40 copper? (even though it won't work that way in Classic with no bonus from quiver for wand)
---
ESO. You can sub for $15, or buy each new expansion separately as one time fees, or get less content for free.
---
I agree it’s not that common in most games, due to the majority of games having a one-time fee and not monthly.
---
I gave up on hoping for Star Citizen
---
It sounds like the perfect mmo, but I just can't bring myself to think it'll ever get done.
---
Tinfoil hat.
---
It actually doesn't. Do you happen to use an Nvidia card? With the proper settings on the driver's it can allow it to go up to 4k, but as far as I'm aware, on release retail vanilla didn't have support above 1080p. I only know this because I was stuck at 1080 and had to switch driver settings around to get 4k.
---
You're talking about two different things there, the astrological definition, and how people talk in their day-to-day conversations. In my experience, the astronomical definition is rarely used in daily conversations, correct or not.
---
That’s an awesome story!
---
It makes the game look smoother.
---
Once you get used to 144hz, 60hz will look choppy.

Able to tranq and do more dmg than other hunters, I guess :D
---
Not Plate.
---
Haha!  If it makes you feel better the GM was probably having a good chuckle and wanted to see how far you would take it while helping some other people at the same time!
---
It was to a degree, policy to take what you say at face value.  Even if I thought you were an level year old lying, which I think pretty much any GM would have at that point, empathizing and moving on is the best way to diffuse the situation for everyone involved, including the people who may see the screen shot later.
---
Know the name of the pvp vid? Sounds interesting
---
Mauradon is confirmed on Phase 1.
---
|Content|Phases|

:--|:--|

|Molten Core|Phase 1|

|Maraudon|Phase 1|
---
Hasn't been my experience at all. Alliance are awesome at 1.12 AV and WSG with freedoms, Bops, and never ending mana on hpals.
---
Lopsided server populations are their own problem, which hopefully blizzard keeps and eye on.
---
i have a screen that supports it, got it yday, but i have only a HDMI cable and it wont support it, what cable am i looking for ?
---
I think The Burning Crusade was probably my most anticipated expansion of all time. When I started playing Vanilla WoW I was apprehensive at first, but quickly was won over. Classic is probably my second most anticipated game ever (Second to TBC).
---
It was possible to get there and see it during vanilla through winterspring if I remember correctly
---
I actually started in early TBC and for me it was something more simple. Taking the transporter from silvermoon to UC and then hitting the map key to get a sense of where I was now.
---
Since you’re looking to PvP, engineering is always good for that. Alchemy and herbalism are great for making gold. Tailors can make bags, which is great early on while people are leveling. Once ZG releases, tailors can make the bloodvine set, which is great for warlocks. Depends on your goals, I guess.
---
For example, I plan to play a paladin and have it start with mining and blacksmithing for some great bis items/gold making. Then, once blacksmithing is maxed out and I have what I want from it, I’ll see about dropping mining for engineering (hopefully after farming mats to level it) for PvP.
---
There’s really no wrong answer.
---
catty passive aggressive response, very brave and masculine.
---
not of all time, but for 2019 for sure. I think I was more hyped for MGS5 but that was a flop
---
&gt; This leads me to question whether Maraudon will be in at launch
---
Why? They said it will be available on the launch. They are still working out it.
---
yeah in Classic everyone pays for 12 piece nuggets and gets 4 piece nuggets...but at least it applies for everyone.
---
Race isn't really a big deal that way. Sure dwarf priests are extra desirable because of Fear Ward, but unless you are in a complete min-maxing guild, nobody is gonna put any weight in what race you play.
---
It's constantly being updated/added to. They just added a full city world, and there are dozens of ships. Space combat, and FPS ground combat. All kinds of stuff. Beta for the Single Player part is supposed to be a little over a year from now.
---
1) They already confirmed Maraudon to be at launch
---
2) They're datamining an alpha/beta build, not the final release.
---
You already have, xpacs are given for free to all accounts (even if inactive) when a new one comes out.
---
Burning Crusade
---
Phase 1 doesn't mean on launch.
---
Water walk/levitate over the open water
---
Couldn't you just use Notepad/Google Docs/pen and paper or something? It accomplishes the same thing, no add-on required. Also if something gets borked with the add-on you wouldn't lose everything and it'd be much easier to share (especially something cloud based) if you're into that.
---
If you still have to ask why after reading the post I don't think anything I say will make you understand.
---
I mean yea thats one game, but it doesn't really compare to blizzard rereleasing an older version of their current game. Sure tons of shit has changed but it's still wow so you're still going to pay the wow sub. Just like when runescape came out with osrs. Don't think they would really want to divide the subs as that would split the community even more. I can totally see why you want them separate but it's very unlikely to happen.
---
Its because it was tuesday
---
Phase 1 is launch.
---
&gt; I assume this is only showing 2K as the max res because thats what the persons monitor is. We'll have 4K support as well, right?
---
The retail game client will support whatever resolution you want to run the game at.  Through upscaling, I was able to run the game client in [a 16K resolution](https://i.imgur.com/V6LFPGb.png).
---
I'm starting in November! I took half of july and half of august off :)
---
Firetree represent! Usually don't see too many people from firetree
---
Back to the drawing board.
---
Content Patch 1 (AKA The Launch Patch) will contain Mauradon.
---
The Alpha build could be either limited in what is accessible.
---
Didn't know that the rank 3 also give you discount for skills. :O
---
Lol good sleuthing. I think it's unlikely but possible I guess. Stuff like Maraudon/Hinterlands Quests/Searing Gorge Quests are just really basic stuff added to flesh out the game that was released early under crunch. I dunno how you could argue they are not 'Vanilla'. Sure they changed the game a bit but the vast majority of people weren't high level then and it's literally just more content in the vanilla style, it's not like it messes with balance or gameplay at all - just means you have more stuff to do.  
---
I think locking it behind phases just means fast levellers won't get to experience it which seems a bit harsh. It's not like you're going to go back and do Mara once you're 60 when it launches, it's far more fun if you can do it at the right level.
---
it might be unavailable in the current build but the plan is for it to be available come classic release.
---
Haha, I knew that was how the thread had to start! ;)
---
Can do it under advanced settings if irrc
---
Your response is basically just saying "anything can happen"
---
Very good point my man. I'll try to remember that.
---
Not for customer service, no.  Probably if you were a salaried employee on some levels, but really they need people at the physical building because that is where all the tools and people you need to function are.
---
All of T2 is dank. A few classes have even better sets T3/4/5/6 But between these--imo, every class' best set is represented.
---
This. When 2nd generation servers reach the end of content progression, they could just dump the character DB onto the 1st gen server.
---
dude
---
It's probably in advanced just like it is on live
---
Rofl. some people.
---
+1 to Savagery
---
will absolutely be playing on classic settings
---
If you still think its not gonna be available at launch i dont think anything anyone says will make you understand that its going to be available at launch.
---
1st Rags kill was fkin awesome! We’d farmed FR mats for gear as a guild, was a brilliant feeing of all the beard work when we finally dropped him.
---
DisplayPort or DVI, DisplayPort is probably best though. 100% get one and make sure you change your control panel settings to 144hz too. If you already have a 144hz monitor there is no reason at all to be sticking on 60, would be a total waste.
---
I was in Winter Spring fighting random demons and the Eye of Shadow dropped.  I had no idea what the item was worth, but I knew it was rare, so I threw it on the AH with a low bid but no buyout.
---
The next morning I logged on to discover it had sold for well over 6,000 gold.  I was flabbergasted and ended up maxing out my professions, buying a few epics on the AH, buying epic mounts for myself and some friends and donating the rest of it to random low level players asking for donations for their mounts.
---
I took off 2 weeks for Vanilla.  Same for every patch until MoP.  WoD was the first one I didn't take time off for.
---
I will be taking time off for Classic.
---
Yes it is... this is a list of what is available to purchase from trainers. A new rank of hemo is available at 46 from your trainer.
---
I didn't get to meet any of the Euro-GMs that I can remember.  Whole different call center for that!
---
Is OP doing the data mining?
---
That's basically all the streamers trying to interpret this data right now.
---
Just get a display port cable. They’re very cheap nowadays.
---
thank you
---
And if still don't realize that the game won't be released in the next 5 minutes, I don't think anything I say will make you understand.
---
I stand corrected.
---
New versions will need to be released provably
---
I may have not read correctly but I think that classic is going to be running on a client build from legion, therefore only addons that can run on legion clients would work.
---
Yes. Wow is by far my favorite game of all time. The hype is way to real!! Im ready for it to ruin my life
---
Added them, even if I am not sure of exactly at what skill they are made. Couldn't find out superquick just now, anyway :P
---
Once you level 1-10 without a pet, and then finally tame one it actually becomes your best friend.  You'll realize how much you need him and when it dies you actually feel bad.  Well I do at least.
---
true; given this year at blizzard and the macro economics bell curve of supply and demand, How do you feel about the decline of WoW's difficulty settings after the vivendi universal acquisition  and Bobby Kotich n J allen?
---
My boy.
---
I didn’t build my own PC just to run ‘04 settings, hit me up with those rippling water graphics!
---
Yeah for sure and I totally agree on why they will keep them the same under one fee. It would probably drive down cash flow and financial markers like # of subs they use to estimate revenue for future retail endeavors.
---
What will be will be so we’ll see.
---
I respect your decision!
---
What's the issue? Why do you press a key you don't want to? Sounds like a very unhelpful habit.
---
There were a few bad days here and there, but nothing I wasn't used to.  Been gaming for as long as I have been making memories.
---
It feels like you're expecting to see a massive difference between 60hz and 144hz while in reality the difference is not that big. Yes, it will definitely be way smoother and everything (animations and just general movement) will look and feel much more crisp, but it won't give you a massive or I would even say a big advantage over 60hz. It is however a big difference if you've been playing on 144hz and then go back to 60hz.
---
This most likely is just an error waiting to be corrected. I wouldn't sweat it.
---
If it doesn’t rain in Goldshire I will EAT 😡 BLIZZARD’S 😡 ASS 😡
---
My comment is facetious.
---
Eso, Skyrim, bf3, mw2 
---
Classic wow probably tops them all for me
---
My reasoning for this is that most people already know that at Level X you get a quest to unlock Y ability. But virtually nobody has memorized every trainer learned ability, their costs and levels. It's just meant to be a handy (quick glance) guide to see when you need to return to town.
---
for 1080p hdmi 1.3 or better, for 1440p hdmi 2.0 or better.
---
Can you change the water quality to classic by itself?
---
It's ugly as.
---
is

Basically its just 1 slot. You can easily equip the bag when you are full and switch back to quiver when you are empty.

First time in MC, first rag kill...I was MT, first razergore kiting as warrior

---
That is interesting.  They didn't have that feature in the game when I worked there so I am not exactly sure, but I definitely would have fought a little harder on the point your friend got it and you earned the title fair and square.
---
I don't know enough about why the policy is like that and what it may be trying to prevent though, so I don't fully grasp the whole picture of the issue from their perspective.
---
This is perfect. Thank you so much for doing this! ;) I will definitely be referencing these every even level.

When I was big into ff, those were my biggest hype launches. But square killed that part of my soul.
---
$15 in 2006 is equivalent in purchasing power to about $18.91 in 2019. So your sub is actually cheaper.
---
????? 
---
   What you think they're gonna launch without fucking molten core dude?

Reading that brought [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dArUSu7wFxM) to mind.

That's the real shit. Putting people on a list, adding them to NPCscan, and getting revenge later on is some of my favorite content. They *always* know why you're coming for them, too. They know they deserve it.

99% sure you can do that.

I think in live if you change water quality to the lowest it's the vanilla texture.

Intro checks out and triggered my PTSD :D

I'm a father of 3 now. I don't have time to level on a pvp server because I'll be way behind the pack. I look forward to getting to 60 and doing stuff with friends, not getting frustrated by 60 rogues ganking me in stv.
---
Why would you ever go double mining? One of those should probably be swapped for herbalism if anything.
---
This is one of the worst, conjecture-filled comments I've seen to date.
---
Are you assuming the paladin to the right's gender?
---
got both dal rends on me rogue in one run
---
For some reason, through imgur the resolution is much lower than your individual posts. I can’t read the training costs on these :/
---
This has been since Nov 2017.
---
They will require tweaking to work but essentially yes.
---
A lot of the crafting professions can be rather expensive to level up. That and the equipment you gather from it doesn’t stay with you for very long and you level out of it.
---
Do I really have to repeat myself?
---
Fury Warriors are almost exclusively using Leather BECAUSE Most Plate items are for Tanks, they are not GOOD for DPS. That's NOT an option even if you try to make it out to be one. That's like saying "Bro, don't loot the +15 Agility piece because you could have that Plate piece...that has intelligence on it"
---
I think I would know what kind of mentality the players had back then as I was one of them, and I accepted the fact that the itemization was horrible and that people had to resort to other armor classes, ask any raider from back then and you will be told the same thing: Fury Warriors sometimes had priority over Rogues when it came to items because of how good they were.
---
And I am slowly beginning to believe that you and the other guy are one and the same person as you both spout that nonsense about DPS warriors having to pass on gear unless they get explicit permission to roll for it.
---
Fact is (and everyone that played back then can confirm it) : Hybrids often rolled for Cloth/Leather gear because Mail/Plate was horrendous.
---
Paladin healer were about 90% cloth most of the time.
---
Fury Warriors easily had half of their equipment as Leather, why? because they wanted it? Nah, it's because they had to in order to do their best.
---
It’s so nice to go 144 from 60 my friend
---
Do you want to roleplay walk around IF or do you want to GET LIT.
---
Sure most people do, like most mages will know they get evocate at 20 and most rogues know they get CS at 26. But that's kinda the point of the graphic isn't it, to show you what you get as you level up? So I think it really does make sense to have totem/forms/stances/summons on here (with a 'quest' tag) from that perspective (although I appreciate that may be a lot more work to do).
---
I legitimately have no idea where you think I said that. I even say in my post that the fact that MC is 100% confirmed on launch is part of the evidence for Mara not being on launch because MC isn't on the page with raids/dungeons that say they aren't available.
---
I feel like Rogue is not the answer, stealth can be so slow in classic.
---
its pretty impressive how delusional you are
---
I was a preteen NE huntard so basically the absolute worst. Somehow made it to level 60 and was accepted into a decent raiding guild that had cleared MC and BWL. God have mercy.
---
Anyway one night I started telling parroting random bs I had heard at school on Ventrilo. My friend at school had been yelling "Suuuper Asiannn Blaaaast!" in reference to kamehameha because DBZ was popular at the time. So I let out a super asian blast on Vent and I'll never forget the hunter class leader who happend to be asian found it hysterical. This dude was dying and so all night he would yell out "super asian blast" while laughing with a thick accent. Good times.
---
Logging onto your alt account doesn't make you correct lmao, at least make the usernames somewhat different.
---
Well now they've disabled weather effects.
---
Phase 1 is launch though...
---
"Sunshafts" makes me all warm and funny.
---
If the game isn't worth $15/mo to you then don't play I suppose.
---
I weigh the value of something next to the enjoyment it gives me.
---
I would happily pay double what they're asking for Classic if I had to. I spend lots of money on more temporary sources of enjoyment in comparison to a $15 subscription.
---
I've geared plenty of characters using this mentality.  Most groups WILL let you roll on the gear, IF you communicate about it first.  A lot players agree with you that warriors should have equal rights to the gear, or at the very least are okay with warriors rolling on it.
---
But, most groups also want you to speak up first and communicate with the group about it, instead of just bullying the rogue.
---
So you want to reward them?
---
That right there is easily the most legendary login screen of all time
---
I have a bad feeling about weather effects...or the lack thereof.
---
Making a salty reply doesn’t make your assumption correct either.
---
It’s an alpha client, and based on what we’ve heard already, Mara is planned for launch.
---
yeah display port cable will support 144 hz and some versions of hdmi do as well
---
That's interesting. So your WoW toon or avatar or whatever was like Neo in the matrix on crack, for real.
---
Blizz is not an ISP, Blizz has not done this with any of their games.
---
You just want to save a few bucks and are trying to rationalize why it makes sense for Blizz to do this.
---
Just because something is in phase 1 doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be available on the first day. As far as we know the only thing it means is that anything in phase 1 is going to happen before Phase 2 begins, and as outlined in the post it looks like MC and Ony are going to be available on launch and Mara will be available sometime after launch.
---
Man this has been great feedback.  So far everyone seems to be split between the two.  Good reasons for both.  It seems to be coming down to time commitment.  Most of the people who are advocating for PVE don't have alot of time per week to spend in game, so they want to make the most of it and don't want to waste any game time fighting PVP'rs.
---
Warrior by far. The leveling process, mkb interaction, and especially the dungeon experience will lead to a very interesting stream. You may hate it but the audience will probably just laugh at your misery.
---
Human Rogue
---
Sorry Horde but you will know my name and hate/admire me
---
I have to agree. Since my latest 60 character on Kronos 3,i have paid almost no attention to W-PVP, been there done that.
---
First run (of MC) with my guild that I formed with a lot of friends on Burning Legion. Both bindings dropped. Never saw something like that again.
---
Explain your insult please, what have I said that's "delusional".
---
So, I'm going to be leveling a mage in classic. Would I not want to take tailoring and enchanting? Hear me out: on a fresh server people are going to want /anything/ that will give them a little bit of an edge. So the early green cloth armor and wands would theoretically help you earn more money than it would take to level them, no? Or I'd the idea that many people would just be trying to blast through as much content as possible to get to 60 quickly?
---
I'll take the official word of Blizzard over your interpretation of the datamined alpha/beta.
---
It's my most hyped MMO of all time, but that's only because we've been in an MMO drought since 2011.
---
My most hyped game ever was probably Zelda: Twilight Princess. I remember playing that on release day on the gamecube! Still play it once a year.
---
Honestly as a tailor your best money maker will be the bags.
---
Not unless you have an IQ of 40 or are taking it in the LEAST charitable interpretation possible.
---
My point is you can do something that blizzard might deem "untasteful" and you could be punished for it, it was in response to the people saying "pvp = pvp hurrrr". They are repeating a lie, you can get banned for no reason at all if they want. They could ban a streamer for liking a Trump post on twitter if they wanted.
---
But you couldn't gather any of that from my post, but don't be curious and ask, instead be a snarky bitch.
---
My favorite is the warlock spell on the top right
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I don't think I can go back to 60. I've been spoiled by the 144 gods.
---
If that was the case, why even bother saying Mara is in Phase 1 anyway? Wouldn’t that be another phase then?
---
I hope we can have an addon that makes the menu look like Vanilla
---
Hi, /u/Ossuary_
---
I gonna play on PVE as well.. fed up with the experience on PVP servers
---
ti was already in the demo, didn't look at all like classic
---
Got any more examples of why we could get banned?
---
lol why is that even a question ...... what is more important for you - damage stats or armor ? Obviously DMG stats.   
---
Especially in classic where the itemazation is all around the map - classes will wear a mixed set of gear
---
I'm well aware that the general idea has been that Mara will be in on launch, that's exactly what I had thought until I saw what I wrote in the post. I'm not even assuming that it's not going to be in on launch, but the fact that it's on the same page as the other raids/dungeons that won't be in on launch makes me think there's a chance that it won't be, which has even more interesting ramifications for other areas of the game.
---
A lot of people are saying Druid, and that’s probably true if you want to be a Druid who can kill someone.  But I distinctly remember HATING druids because it was too easy for them to run away from a fight and be flat out oppressive.   They were most certainly the most OP flag runners in WSG as well, regardless of skill level.  Anyone could throw on a Hot and spam shapeshift.
---
I cannot play BFA at 60 FPS. It literally hurts my eyes and causes a headache. I capped them to 60 to see how it would affect stream performance and just can’t do it. Pick up anywhere from a 120-144 monitor and make sure your GPU can pump out that number of frames constantly. It’s like butter.
---
makes sense, thanks for taking the time to answer
---
It matters significantly.
---
All of your top end gear is made for elemental, 2.5 is among the best pvp gear for any class. And you play more like a healer whit insane burst if you start fight whit 2 shamans casting a lightning bolt then instant chan lightning then a frost shock you almost always win the fight
---
Also once you have the right cable, make sure you turn 144hz on in the windows advanced display settings. I know someone who hadn't turned it on for a couple years
---
Ocarina of Time for me. Rare example of a game with historical levels of hype delivered historical results.
---
Because it may be happening early on and before the things in phase 2? Phases might not mean that things are all released on the exact day of the new phase.
---
DVI-D supports 144hz as well. My ASUS monitor came with a DVI-D cable.
---
If you are guildies and you know the person is gonna play with you then yes. But if its a pug then why should he get it ? You both invested the same amount of work. This is not communism nobody cares if its a big upgrade or not this is meritocracy. It only makes sense in guild because it will help the raid....
---
People make all these big claims about how “60 is so choppy!” But in all honesty unless you’re that fast, performance wise, you won’t do any better, a subtle difference in frame rate won’t make much of a difference.
---
Read things here, especially the dev watercoolers: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
I base it entirely on how much I value the game and the enjoyment it brings me.
---
I would easily pay obscene amounts to play Classic since I love it so much, so in my eyes getting this game at $15/mo is a steal.
---
Use borderless windowed mode
---
Ahahahaha, no alt account. Thanks for trying. Some people.
---
Without a doubt. I've been wanting official Classic since they shut Nostalrius down, and my hype for it hasn't gone down since, only increased. Part of it for me I think is that theoretically I could play Classic by hopping on a private server, but I'm stopping myself from doing so for numerous reasons. But still, the temptation is always there.
---
Me and my "business class ultrabook" will be as well.
---
But if I turn around how am I going to see anything?
---
You clearly have no idea what you're talking about. Getting to 60 in a week is really easy if you play alot and don't sleep much. I feel like 3/4of this thread are people that actually never played Vanilla since tbc came out. Y
---
ou're all out of touch and you think you know everything it's really funny.
---
That would be a very confusing way to run things, not to mention contradictory to what we’ve heard from Blizzard so far. Really this seems like less of you asking a question and more of an assertion of what you feel is correct presented as a question.
---
This is legendary. Thanks!
---
I'm more hyped about the elder scrolls 6 but I'd say classic is my #2.
---
Depends on your raid schedule. Try and find a guild that doesn't have an annoyng schedule like Tuesday Thursday Saturday and something like Tuesday-Thursday. That way you can be PVE spec during raid week and w/e the hell you want on off nights. The less you have to respec the better. Honestly though, if your goal is farming gold in your spare time the cheaper option is an alt for support classes.
---
To be fair, that usually was with an agreement.
---
F.ex. when I looked for a tank, the warrior would whisper "hi, I can tank, but I want to roll DPS for X gear, that ok?" and 99% of the time it would be no problem.
---
But if a tank randomly rolled on a dps gear without a heads up, it would be kinda ninjaing.
---
As a nondenominational Baptist, Catholic, Episcopalian Jesuit of the third order, child of god. 
---
This triggers me.
---
Basically because they weren't authentic players who were violating a bunch of different policies.
---
If your only function in game is to farm monsters therefore taking them away from legitimate players it kind of hurts the game, and if it's left unchecked everyone it really hurts the game.
---
There were way worse offenders than those guys though.  The people with bots and hacks were more likely to be targeted than a person gold farming for a company who sells gold.
---
Does this just show when you get what skills or does it show the optimal skills to obtain while leveling?
---
So roughly 312 Gold to purchase all abilities and Riding
---
Yes it is.  The hunter needs something to fill his bags with so when he wins a need roll it doesn’t auto loot and then he AFKs and the mob despawns and no one gets it.  Did you even play vanilla?
---
Warrior by far. The leveling process, mob interaction, and especially the dungeon experience will lead to a very interesting stream. You may hate it but the audience will  just laugh at your misery and and check in to see what your doing wrong. Because twitch always knows what is the right and most optimal method of playing games.
---
didn’t they announce an open beta or something recently?
---
What about things like the phytoblade?
---
I wanted to play Druid, and I did not want to play a Night Elf. Therefore I was made to play Horde.
---
Ha!
---
If they don’t include weather effects, there’s gonna be a riot.
---
This. Nuff said.
---
male troll mage
---
I remember the cost went up and up if you did it too frequently, but did it go back down after a few weeks?
---
I figured as much but as I am sure you are aware, sarcasm doesn’t do well in written form unless you mark it as such
---
Starcraft Brood War. 
---
Made my mom drive me to the store to grab it then ripped open the box and sat in the car reading the instruction manual while she finished the rest of her errands.
---
Better than warrior priest?
---
I have a Discord bot that auto post Blue Post to Discord. PM if you want an invite and I can have it ping you when an update comes out.
---
Burning crusade balanced this bit better with healers :   
---
Resto druids and Priests wanted items with spirit where as resto shammies and holy pals wanted intelect / mp5. So paladin needing on healer cloth was stupid and retarded ;-)
---
No, respec decay was in TBC. It only went up in vanilla and capped at 50g.
---
I am curious about the Raid ui. Is it Vanilla Raid UI, or is there a setting for both?
---
It definitely is not a HUGE difference, but going from 144hz to 60hz does feel very choppy. If you're used to 144hz, anything lower you will notice. You can compare it with going from your 60 fps game to a 30 fps game.
---
I'm not sure why you'd think presenting evidence that something might be the case automatically means I'm saying that it's 100% going to be the case. And having some content release between phases doesn't contradict anything blizzard has said so far, only if you take the phases to mean one release of everything in that phase at one time, but blizzard hasn't said that.
---
Troll anything 🤣
---
God I hate trolls so much, every time I saw one I just hated that they never wore shoes.
---
It does, but not quickly. If you’re respecting twice a week (into pvp/farming spec for off nights then back to pve raid spec), it’ll get to 50g and won’t come down. I remember it taking ages to start to decrease
---
maining a druid in retail is what turned me off from the class for classic lol. I tried leveling one for a bit on a private server and was so bothered by little QOL things like not being able to talk to NPCs in shapeshift form, or having to manually shift out of form to cast rejuv rather than it being done automatically upon pressing the button
---
damn that is so dumb
---
Not really man, 137 guilds cleared naxx before BC. Of those guilds only 39 did them before November. Between November and the new year is 8 weeks minus the holidays so 6 weeks. 39 guilds were farming naxx before TBC came out if that’s what they even did between the days they cleared it and TBC. That’s a very small percentage.     
---
Take death and taxes. They had 12 weeks k thuzad kills. That’s 24 breastplates. Half the guild could possibly have 9/9.
---
If that’s true then reckoning leveling spec will lose a lot of its power. Prot aoe grinding may still be effective though
---
Maybe Nelf rogue? Your active racial is pretty mediocre since you can already stealth.
---
Human warlock isn't great, you can already get stealth detection with Felhunter and the spirit bonus helps you the least.
---
Troll mage and rogue, zerking isn't that great for squishy classes that can't heal, since these classes are all about avoiding damage, and zerking and full health is basically pointless.
---
Capped at 50g? Is that expensive for Vanilla? I can't remember pricing from back then
---
No it did not. Characters were not carried over from beta to Vanilla. Nor was there a head start.
---
Top quality meme,  keep 'em coming
---
I’ll never forget when I rolled 99 for fang of venoxis. I was on the ground screaming lol.
---
I got u bro
---
GMs weren't allowed to play while on the clock.  Personal account and GM account were totally separate and not meant to be operating at the same time.  During the early days of my employment there I was super hardcore into WoW.  I ran a raiding guild, had a PvP Rank 13 Priest during the time I wasn't clocked in.  Especially when I was trying to rank up, I would eat lunch at my desk off the clock and PvP for an hour at lunch on the normal game client.
---
That’s not Nostalrius.
---
Legion was the latest version of the client when they started the project but it doesn't make any sense to keep it there. They want both games to use the latest client framework as it is improved (DX12, bug fixes, security, and etc.).
---
Troll mage is better than undead for pve. Not sure about rogues, but I’d imagine troll would be as good as orc on some fights, and better on others that you don’t want to use bloodfury on
---
Get over it loser
---
Yeah that's the best. 2nd best is if you head down the shore in westfall you get to a spot that's stv but only one sea monster mob. You can fish up blackmouth and firefins.  I did that on an alt I was leveling when I had to alt tab out frequently.
---
Man, warlocks have a lot of talents they need to keep training.
---
It's very expensive if you're not farming on a regularly basis.
---
I enjoyed D3.
---
50g is about an hour of very **efficient** farming
---
Ahhh, so that is why warlock gets cheap mount... Cause he spent all his cash on skills.
---
I know everyone has their own opinions but I’m sure I’ve seen polls where judgement wins as best set by a monstrous amount over every other set (up to and inc legion I think)
---
True but the client will be 1.12
---
Greetings JonerPwner!  This is former Game Master Mikimao.  After review of your issue we have determined than the triage quest is currently working as intended.  We are always looking for suggestions on how to improve the game, so I recommend you drop us a suggestion on the WoW suggestion forums.  Is there anything else I can help you with?
---
I think I need to get over this idea that I can somewhat get ahead of the damage after surviving the burst and keep at a healthy level.
---
There is a difference, definitely. The question is really if the price markup (144 monitors are more pricey) is worth it, and how much that difference will matter to OP.
---
The level of jonesing in this sub is too relatable and worrying.
---
I have an Nvidia card yes. But I assure you I did nothing to get pservers to work in 4k. The slider in game just goes to 4k.
---
I didn't have 4k back in retail vanilla so I wouldn't know how it was then
---
It is *technically* the opposite situation for me. I would probably like a PvE server after only knowing my PvP server for many years; I was a pacifist so I never started any fights and even went so far as to spectate a 1v1 fight and make that one Horde player that lost angry at my lack of participation! Despite it sounding much more peaceful than a PvP server, I'm actually planning on starting fights with everyone I can because I never experienced it before. I could flag myself for PvP on a PvE server but the ride I'm getting on this time is one of ganking and bullying and rivalries.
---
Hunter maybe
---
So basically what you are looking for is.. paladin?
---
Sounds like you want to play a Paladin.
---
Tanking Nefarian for about 15 seconds on one of our kills. I think the MT died.
---
Oh yeah, I was a rogue :D.
---
Oof, you sure told me. 
---
What exactly am I getting over? You were the one downvoted here, not me
---
Death knights
---
It is for me.  I just wish my RL friends were open to it.  They are enjoying retail and I already talked to them about it, they have no interest in parting with the QoL stuff.
---
Same here :&lt;
---
&gt; I want good dps  
---
wait, nvm...
---
I think the dream scenario here is that Blizzard lets this happen... but doesn't tell anybody about it. You'll be getting several large guilds competing over world bosses for a long time, how long is it going to take before someone (or a group or whatever) decides to risk losing their loot to try dragging one through several zones all the way to a major city, not knowing whether or not it would even work? As far as anyone knows, there's a decent chance that after a while he'll just break combat, evade out and run back to his spawn, and they'll have sacrificed their pull for nothing.
---
After FF8 I was so hyped for the more traditional fantasy of FF9.
---
Vanilla WoW and Resident Evil 2
---
Two of the best games in the same year. :D
---
Gnome warlock, simply because I want to be a cute bag of death.
---
What is the bonus? Do you need to maintain tailoring to get it?
---
I think I had the change it cause I messed with the settings to get a different game to 4k :P
---
Depends on how much time and patience you have for farming. From what I remember, the **average** wow player was either really poor or living the frugal life in hopes of getting an epic mount some day. This means the **average** player basically choose 1 spec and kind of stuck with it until they got tired of it or their guild needed them to be something else. 
---
In fact, it wasn’t unheard of for people to roll identical class characters so they could have, for example, a tank warrior and dps warrior since the idea of respecing multiple times a day was not practical. Also, since the vast majority of guilds were not hard core min/maxing, people would frequently use a frankenstein or “off-meta” build that favored being a generalist, i.e. selecting talents that worked in pvp, dungeons, and raids without focusing on a AI gle aspect of the game. Also worth noting, since the majority of spells are baseline, you can play outside your talents more easily than modern wow. For example, a “shadow” priest can still heal virtually all the dungeons without respecing holy/disc, it will just be a little harder without the ideal talents. 
---
That said, if you really want to swap around, you can do that. Just make sure you have the time, patience, and professions to farm for gold (or be comfortable with your AH game). Some people even had a “farming” character which was usually a hunter. Gold isn’t as easy to acquire in vanilla as live, so unless you’re actively trying to farm gold you may find yourself barely scraping by with just enough gold for repairs, reagents, potions, crafting professions, spells, and occasional AH items.
---
Yup. My g510 has this
---
TBC or Wrath probably take the most hyped ever title for me. Difficult to choose between those, but it’s definitely the most hype in the last 9-10 years
---
I bet it triggers you so hard.
---
Nice! I'm personally maxing everything out except the water. Like, don't get me wrong, the ripple effects are pretty. But there's something weird about having that shiny, unmoving lake surface on all the oceans and rivers.
---
4k is nothing special tbh. I would say go for 144hz because of how smooth it is. Unless you can get a monitor that supports both for that price
---
Alot of slot for warrior don't have any plate/mail that come close to the bis leather item.
---
Sounds about right lmao
---
Is it just me or is there one of these surveys every week?
---
Was he a good healer?
---
To be fair literally everybody expected D3 to be a good game, Blizzard never did a bad game before it.
---
Oh yea: most likely. Boo. We’ll find a way
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.11.0    
---
The cost to unlearn talents will now decay over time. This cost will be reduced by a rate of 5 gold per month to a minimum of 10 gold.    
---
Eh those things don't really bother me.. i play druid in retail because of resto its SOOO OP atm in PVP/PVE and since i main a War in retail getting a caster class is really nice.
---
The problem is that you are rendering a 3D application in a window - your GPU really prefers you using full screen exclusively to render images so it doesn't have to bother with the regular OS environment at the same time. Obviously, borderless window will work just fine, but it's not *quite* the same as running a game full screen.
---
Pretty much everything in this thread. Everyone is telling you that you're wrong and you are taking it as a personal insult and refusing to budge at all. Is it so hard to admit that you were wrong?
---
What is your current monitor?
---
What is your current graphics card?
---
Pretty much this. I use the Dell S2716DG and it's nice. 144hz/1440p. A good middle ground between 1080/4k but the 144hz and Gsync are amazing.
---

\#brave #classic #proudofblizzard #livelaughlove
---
Got any more? ffs
---
Yeah just wondering about the DKP since there is not DKP in loot council :P
---
Thank you! The 4K was really just to play my ps4 on one day was the thought behind that but it’ll be a long time after classic drops that I’ll even turn on my ps4 for gaming
---
Possibly a mirrored image.
---
Smoothest way to level a Paladin is to use Wisdom + bandages to keep yourself afloat. The biggest limiting factor in a Paladin's leveling speed is how much downtime they have since they basically just seal, judge, seal, auto attack and top themselves off.
---
Looks like you want everything, but you can't have everything. If you're good at one thing chances are you'll be lacking in another area. You just have to live with it but that's what's so great about classes, they specialize in their own areas unlike in retail where everyone can do everything. Just prioritize what you want the most and commit to it and try to be the best at it. That's how you'll have the most fun. Being indecisive won't get you anywhere. If you think something else looks cool down the road you can always make another character.. the game won't be going anywhere :)
---
Yup 1440p 144hz widescreen is the way i go
---
I love stories of lowbies having good experience with end game players.
---
So good. And then followed by 10 which I still love. But then came x-2. I should have known.  I remember being about an hour into that game and just thinking, what the shit is this.
---
I personally use an acer 27inch 1080p 144hz monitor and love it. Price 200-600 depending on other stuff. Mine were 250 each a few years ago. I would say if you can run it try for 1080 144hz
---
I'll never understand why someone would want uglier textures and shadows but hey to each their own I guess? I'm going to play this in 4k, ultra settings, fuck this 2004 ass looking mode.
---
One if my favorite moments was early morning on the 4th of July in either 2005 or 2006. I woke up around 5 a.m. to play on my human fury warrior in Westfall. Equipped with one of those Mt. Dew energy drinks, I was killing gnolls and another character who was on the same quest. We teamed up for hours just questing, but she logged off later that morning to go buy fireworks with her kids. 
---
It wasn't much special like a raid or anything, but I'm very fond of that day.
---
Been data mined but no and you'll know when you can because this sub will blow up
---
Hm was there even a change in TBC then? Maybe it's just because gold was way easier to come by it felt like a change.
---
Good question
---
Wut
---
I used to run my dailies in class. Got straight A's.
---
Thank you!! This sub has become my new addiction I check it all the time lol
---
Shaman, pally, druid
---
Every raid wipe is Easter.
---
Just dragging a file browser window across the screen between 144 and 60 is shocking.
---
No joke. Once you see 120+ there's no going back. None. Even for the most basic stuff.
---
Warrior will roll on the best dps gear wether it's leather/mail/plate and there is nothing you can do about it. Actually most will reserve all the dps item they want (or make sure to not invite a rogue for example if they want a certain leather piece) if they tank and since tank are so rare people will still join.
---
If you are salty about it, don't roll a rogue. Tanks are the one to choose the rules about the gear and there is nothing you can do about it.
---
Just for the nostalgic value really. Adds to the feel of the game if you play it similarly to how you originally played it.
---
Yeah it's honestly terrifying every minute I don't look at it and might miss somethjng
---
ok now the free warlock mount makes sense
---
wut
---
Because 17.3 is BIG. Too big for a laptop. 15" is the sweet spot for an affordable, decent performance and mobile laptop
---
She was a keyboard turner but doesn't matter had sex
---
Do you remember that one hack I forget the name of it but people used it undetected for a longgg time. It would let people teleport, climb walls, speed hack, no stun, move through terrain. Crazy hack. Also wowglider? I know some people who leveled a 60 of every class using glider. Just curious if at the time yall were aware of the cheating going on and how it was unpunished for quite a bit.
---
Never played dark souls but ive been hyped for many games and wow classic is turning out to be my Hype Raid boss, new desk, new coffee machine, beast comp, buckets of kitty toys so i can distract my keyboard saboteur only thing left is the announcement so i cn quit my job xD
---
Your friends must have been pretty bad.  4 level 60s with the rank 14 weapons and (I’m assuming) the epic pvp set should have been able to handle one rogue regardless.  When they made the pvp set welfare they still had to have some pvp experience getting the honor.  That is unless they had the rank 14 weapons and green armor.
---
How will we know if the beta is actually how it was back then? The Classic demo had all kinds of things wrong, like rogue energy regen for example.
---
where's this from?
---
Thank you for doing this AMA! I'm reading all your answers and I find it very interesting. 
---
What was the pay like as a GM?
---
Whatever man, I'm pumping everything to ultra, if there's one thing I'm not looking for in classic is the shitty 2004 graphics but hey to each their own I guess :P
---
Uh, tough sell. Every class that has a strength you want also has a weakness you don't. 
---
Warriors do good damage and wear plate mostly. But are a pain to level.
---
Paladins are mainly used for healing which requires wearing cloth usually and their DPS isn't the best.
---
I think Hunter or Shaman are probably your best bet.
---
They should seriously take out the retail water texture,it's just not fair. With vanilla water textures you can't see shit what's underwater,a lot of PvPers used to hide and sneak in the water and no you can't people if you have nameplates on.
---
There are ways to to make it not a reward my ugly young friend 😏
---
'What should i gem in the blue socket as a fire mage??'
---
I heard you can re-enable them in BFA.
---
Warlock right next to warrior was pretty crazy. They have like 4 times the amount of abilities.
---
I'll provide the opposite opinion here, but as always people will have different needs based on what they are doing. For a slower paced game like WoW I'd prefer a 4k monitor vs a faster refresh rate. If we were talking fast paced fps things might be different.
---
 Remember 1080p is the same amount of pixels as 1600x1200... which is what I was playing classic WoW at in 2004. On a screen that's 32''+ you really start to notice the difference. You can't beat having a 42'' 4k monitor, it's like having a window into Azeroth. I had a 42'' but it was a little too big for productivity use, I'm currently on a 32'' 4k and find it the best balance for pretty much everything I do, pixel density &gt; then anything else IMO.
---
Might as well install netzero and play dial up, technical limitations dont mean nostalgia to me but hey to each their own.
---
Render scale is pretty awesome! Is that a settings from retails? I havn't touched retails in years.
---
god I hope so too. I miss the nights SO FUCKING MUCH and the rain. Goddamnit why did they ever fuck it up.
---
No. Pantheon Rise of the Fallen is for me. But i'll be playing Classic until it releases
---
you are the man
---
another thing to consider is PvE community servers have a much higher average age than PvP servers. you even said it yourself - "Maybe it's just because I'm much older now and just want to enjoy the game itself and not the world pvp aspect as much anymore."
---
i started on a PvE private server a few years back when i was i believe 18 years old and i felt like i was the youngest person on the server by a landslide. at least half the people i interacted with were 30+ talking about their wives + kids + fulltime jobs etc and that they all picked PvE servers for generally the same reason - they don't have time for griefing nonsense. so the rate of maturity i feel is much higher on PvE servers, the community of that PvE private server i played on has not been rivaled since by any PvP server. i admit that the thrill of killing a person that tried jumping you on PvP servers feels glorious, but i'll be going PvE when classic comes out directly because of the community almost certainly being better to play in - and it's nice that i can drop my guard when i just want to chill out with some farming.
---
Have you seen his dental plan?
---
That's two today. I'm curious what other opinions you hold that are based in fiction.
---
I banned quite a few accounts who were perpetually in Dire Maul using that hack.  It seemed like the majority were linked to Gold Farming.
---
No idea how that wasn't flagging something, but it was real obvious when you teleported to someone and they were floating 50 feet above a boss shooting it unharmed.
---
Predator gaming? Amazing monitor I have the same one.
---
Thank you!! I am really glad you are enjoying it!
---
Started as a Temp at $10/hr.  Got $12 at full time and worked my way up to $15.
---
Awesome list man! Didnt not know that there were specific bonuses to armor sets that you needed a profession to male it active. Is there a list of what those set bonuses do?

Do addons have their own dedicated user interface like they do now?
---
Do you think you're getting in? Think again everyone. Unless you're a streamer you aren't getting jack shit except blue balls waiting on the release. Blizz is going to use the beta as an advertisement and not as a means of finding all the bugs that might be in the build. There will be zero advertisements outside of free advertising with streamers and the like. You're not going to be in the beta.
---
That’s because it wasn’t done...
---
Assuming you will farm your pre raid BiS then your options on mail are limited. I am a rogue player and I understand what it is to fight for gear. I have no problem losing a leather item over to a hunter or whatever, everything will drop again. What I used to do back in the day was just to communicate and ask. Sometimes I was rejected but most of the times people were cool, especially if you are in a good group, you can always rerun the instance.
---
My advice is try to make friends early on for running dungeons later and just try to negotiate with other leather wearers. 
---
Do note that sometimes you will have to give way for other people, you really don’t have much of a choice unless you want to act as a douche.
---
When you join a group just say you need X item and see what happens, if they are difficult, you can always just need on it and hope for the best.
---
Why three way? Is that to make for certain it is like a code issue rather than a specific input? I know nothing about code but am curious why you specifically jumped to three-way diffs.

If no tester plays the game "normally", then which one is going to be able to say if they have issues without actively trying to break the game?
---
I get the point you are trying to make, but a huge portion of a beta test is to see what happens when people just play the game as is.
---
Prefer a G13 for gaming myself. :)
---
They were indeed terrible.  Keyboard turning clicking and all.  That’s why I had to put an end to the talk ha
---
It is 
---
But only because Star Wars 1313 got cancelled..
---
Professions next? =)
---
Also, to be fair, they did a pretty good job of fixing it. It's no D2 but it's no longer a bad game either.
---
That’s how i felt about The Order 1886... 
---
So disappointing
---
I think they provide an exclusive benefit of value to the player using them, that is, the cooldown itself is worth passive gold. This would factor in to the ultimate decision of which profession to choose.
---
Are you a streamer? No? Then you won't be invited. It's that simple.
---
They ported their engine and server infrastructure. No different than when porting a game to a new engine.
---
Some data is easy to translate and bring to newer or different engines, some isn't.
---
I imagine outside of porting they performed some type of optimization and reconstruction. Like perhaps they remade all quests using the new quest development tools instead of just making them work in the new engine. I don't know far they took they port. I imagine they could probably write a library to translate in bulk, then rewrite what needs to be rewritten for compatibility. If everything is kept in a database like quest ID, title. Texts, regards, etc - the translation should be fairly smooth, with the usual hiccups.
---
There's a lot they would probably have to fix during porting and translating old data for the new infrastructure but outside of art, models, etc, there's a lot kept in tables in a database I'm assuming, which can be straight forward when writing tools to translate or port. The basic structure would be Table A in OG needs to go to table C.3 in new hotness.
---
I've ported a few times between engines and sometimes it's not bad and other times it can be a headache, mostly due to incompatibility between scripts and programming languages.
---
We did deadmines with a ragtag guild group ^^ good vibes and a memorable day xD
---
Sidenote : Young me was pretty asocial so i grinded solo to 55, found a great guild with lowbies who couldnt believe i never done an instance, they made me go, best decision ever xD
---
Awesome! Definitely a handy guide to have for Classic and a good way to plan for maximizing leveling.
---
The sub count is almost as tumescent as I am.
---
Hire a competent data scientist to do the NLP / train a deep neural net to sort the good reports from the bad reports.
---
It'll look and feel nicer, I really notice when games run at 60 fps now. But it won't affect how well you play.
---
Ya, give it to corrupt reddit mods so they can hand them all out to their friends or sell them on ebay.
---
same. i think my excitement for both were about equal
---
*Looks at OSRS* 
---
Maybe because that just looks better to them?  I prefer the original look myself because it just feels better.
---
So what your saying is we should ~~bug~~ PAY the mods.
---
I’m sure the majority were gold farmers, but did you ever ban anyone who was using like just the no stun hack in pvp? I feel like it was a much harder thing to report / notice and a lot of people just thought an item was used etc. I actually remember reporting someone because they accidentally had it on outside org in a duel and they weren’t stunned at all by kidney or cheap shot but Idk if they were ever actually banned. So you were aware of the hack but at the time there was no surefire way to ban everyone using it basically? Like it had to be witnessed by a GM the anticheat wouldn’t pick it up? Thanks for answering btw. 
---
Also if you can say what server(s) did you GM for? I played on Illidan and Stonemaul.
---
fucking Heroes 🤘
---
The more you think about class picking, it’s more likely to be a hunter in the End. Trust me.
---
That still sounds awesome from someone who can't go. To see this exclusive location no one really gets to see. Thanks for sharing your experience with us!

Hi, /u/fows_cs

2% crit, I dont know if you need to maintain it or not.  I'm going to guess the answer is yes.

RETAIL NORMIES GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY SUB. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
He was a Shaman anyway.
---
Play on Mac
---
Probably by people like you who can't seem to separate fictional and real world events and attribute what people do in fantasy games as 100% accurate indicators of personality traits. Maybe you should consider relaxing for a bit and just enjoy your hobby, rather than complaining about everyone who doesn't meet your morals in an online game.
---
Go for a real challenge mode, and play on a PvE server while constantly flagged for /pvp.
---
all skills.
---
My first thought was No, but I can't think of many that would have been bigger. Halo 2/3? MW2? TBC? WotLK was super hype even though we quit at the 3.0 patch for Warhammer Online, which was also pretty hype. I think Classic WoW might be, yeah. WC3R is up there too haha.
---
I dislike the changes they made to oldschool runescape, just play runescape 3 or retail wow if you want new content.
---
The worst thing is, these days you can't even be 100% certain this was a satire/joke.
---
I hope you like doing stretching exercises. All the time. Every spellcast. Up and down.
---
I’m on the fence about this myself for similar reasons.  What might tip me over the edge is that I suspect that fewer pirate server elitists will be on PVE
---
Doesn't matter.
---
You’re a wow classic legend
---
Man, those frankenbuilds really made the game for me. If anything, I'm sad that gold farming techniques ended up being strong enough for hardcore players to afford regular respecs, as it normalised single-purpose minmaxing, which in turn edged out other sub-optimal (but viable) builds.
---
It's probably my least popular opinion relating to WoW, but if anything I actually wish that Vanilla had done MORE to limit frequent spec changes. Make a system that allows people to experiment early on and make small, one-off changes, but prevents players from running multiple builds on the same character. It'd be interesting to see a world where even the hardcore crowd favoured generalist builds that could do reasonable well in all fields of play, rather than excelling in one and sucking at all the others.
---
As an overnight dispatcher who prob spends 80% of his shift gaming ( I take my tower to work ) this is 100% me.
---
Jesuits don't joke.
---
Wasn't asking you, but explain what there is to budge on. Because nowhere did I claim what I was saying was going to happen, only that it could potentially be the case and is something to look into more. Is it so hard to admit you were wrong?
---
A closed beta for multiplayer.
---
It was announced as a possibility.
---
They also had said they'd get the game in the hands of players at some point by 2016 and, well...
---
I’d disagree with that assessment - attention is fleeting.
---
We don't know the answer to this yet.
---
Might even just serve as an opportunity to stress test classic specific tech and get a little mainstream hype going.
---
Just pop the key out
---
I’ll be respecting twice leveling once to arms and once to prot around 58ish. I plan to tank an assload and farm herbs in my spare time. Get raiding ready and start MC grinds weekly.
---
Opening cut scene did it for me.
---
When in doubt, paladin, druid or shaman. Decide as you level
---
Ya not sure if it's because I'm on mobile but even when I download the image it's only 640x320. Could OP provide higher resolution uploads somewhere? Would be great to have this printed out while leveling!
---
I think most of the stuff that is changed [shaped shadows, water, etc] looks worse than the classic stuff.
---
I'm doing this exact thing as we speak. lol. I bought BfA about a week ago and I'm enjoying my time with it. Like you, I stopped playing retail awhile ago - stopped when I capped WoTLK.
---
This is outdated, DirectX 12 does away with exclusive full screen completely and the performance detriment doing this in DX11 was within margin of error of being “none at all”
---
Can’t say I’m not poppin member berries like tic taks.
---
It's not an actual taunt, it's just ability that generates "high" threat (415 threat at 60). Waste of focus for the pet but it should not be pulling any aggro from tank.
---
It's a habit I was taught when making these sorts of changes.
---
1. Reference View - What you're aiming for.
---
2. Prior build - The build where you found the problem in.
---
3. Adjusted build - The build where you think you fixed it.
---
It allows you to check that what you changed is \*closer\* to the reference than what it was previously.  Especially things like lighting and texture mapping.  Its primarily a technique for reverse engineering or recreating visual effects.  When you're trying to fix things, its often easy to drift *away* from the reference without realising it.  If you do, you can roll back to the earlier build and try again.
---
My most hyped game was actually vanilla wow. I remember the burning sensasation of wanting wow to come out for a year before launch. I'm glad I get to experience that again with classic!
---
It isn't just you, but when you're a dehydrated man crawling through the desert you'll take any drops of water you can get.
---
I’m strongly considering getting a vent server instead of using discord for somewhat nostalgic reasons. But also I feel like discord’s voice quality is kinda poopy. May be a struggle to get some people to use any apps other than discord nowadays though
---
Alliance for life, but, i go where Shamanism takes me even if it's on team red.
---
Sorry this post is kind of a mind fuck if you’re on a phone and night mode :)
---
That's a lot of SUCC
---
Thanks for the insight!
---
&gt;  but explain what there is to budge on. 
---
That there is any chance that Mara will not be in at launch.
---
&gt;Because nowhere did I claim what I was saying was going to happen
---
Maybe not 100% explicitly, but you argued with everyone when they said no, it's going to be in. Which seems to really indicate that you do think it was, or had any chance at all for that matter, going to happen. 
---
&gt; only that it could potentially be the case and is something to look into more 
---
Which you said to everyone who said that it was for sure going to be in.
---
Actaually kind of makes me look forward to when leather mail and plate healers an have the option of throwing cloth gear on again, just for aesthetics if nothing else.
---
I agree with you for the most part, but logically speaking there would be at least some items that only someone skilled in that craft would be able to use.
---
1. Druid - shifting in and out of form, managing mana, energy and rage is like playing 3 classes at once
---
2. Holy Paladin - positioning is absolutely vital if you don’t want to be destroyed, you will have anticipate and plan way ahead, good paladins are unkillable
---
3. Enhancement Shaman - forget those videos that show you how you can 1 hit a player, chances are not everyone will have BiS Raid gear. You need to master the totems, dispell, positioning and survivability
---
4. Arms Warrior - assuming you will have no pocket heal and not the best gear to begin with, managing rage and stance dancing is what separates the gods from peasants, also good positioning, good warrior will never allow you in his dead zone
---
From here on I believe these are the classes:
---
5. Priest - any spec really, shadow takes no skill, but healing will be the same as the paladin but a little bit easier because you can mix with disc and actually do some good damage
---
6. Hunter - all you need to be aware of is weaving auto shots and firing between the timer with stutter stepping, pretty easy once you get the hang of it.
---
7. Mage - it does not take much to be a good mage in vanilla, but definitely much much easier to learn to be effective with than the Druid
---
8. Warlock - Many possible specs, not hard to get used to, high damage, high sustainability, high on health but very gear dependent 
---
9. Rogue - not much to say here, cold blood with prep takes 1 hour of practicing and you will delete 90% of the players in seconds
---
Puts into perspective the amount of trained abilities for Rogues and Warriors vs. all other classes.
---
Read the post before you start calling people a liar, cmon man.
---
You'll need displayport for resolutions over 1080p most likely, but HDMI, DVI-D, and DP all support 1080p 144hz

Hah have a good time dude! Fk cancer

I'll admit are the risk of getting hate that I've always hated that"expected" set
---
me and a few friends on mal’ganis made a &lt;Goon Squad Bronze&gt; (making fun of the  gold/platinum/etc names) and pretended to be real goon squad guys, making the SA guys really salty. good times. it was made by that gezora guy if any mal’ganis people on here remember him.
---
As the other person said, there should be no issue with the original vanilla game client supporting whatever resolution you want to throw at it, and here it is in 8K:
---
https://abload.de/img/untitledwxkrp.jpg
---
&gt;C'Thun
---
You realize most people aren't going to kill C'thun right? I mean only like 5% of raiding guilds actually made it that far in vanilla to begin with and sure this is modern day internet where we have more resources available, but many people aren't going to get that far for more reasons than just a lack of info.
---
TLDR: these gloves are still going to be BIS and highly valued for the majority of people that don't make go to Cthun/naxx
---
A classic CSGO copypasta
---
&gt;Holy shit. When people said that the difference was "pretty noticeable" I was like "meh, probably a waste of money" Until I saw how fucking insane this shit is. 60hz feels like absolute shit now and I don't think I can ever go back. It's like playing a whole new game. If you're considering getting a 144hz, do it right now, you will not be upset.
---
I'm not sure why that's happening for some people. They all show up full-size on my PC and laptop. Is there some other site I can upload them to? If so, let me know, and I'll put them up there too.
---
Dammit! I thought I had my mind made up on rolling a female dwarf priest with spinning pigtails, but now you have me thinking human again.
---
Cata was when I started seeing the treadmill
---
Incredible. Thank you for your hard work!
---
How is a mage with long brown hair fighting on Karazhan not Medivh again?
---
Shows you when.
---
If you have PVP and PVE specs, its really 100g since you'd have to go back to your previous spec for raids or whatever.
---
So did dad just never play catch with you?
---
Warlock hands down! no question about it
---
Deathcoil gives me nightmares
---
You're correct, the ultimate purpose of a queue is to establish a worst case scenario for the server to handle, and to lower the chances of many players being in over area across the board. This is the technical reason anyway.
---
From a game design perspective, a server with a cap of 3k people and a server with a cap of 10k people requires very different considerations. Theres an interview done with one of the original game devs on ClassiCast where he mentions that the ~3K server population limit was the intended cap for design reasons, not technical ones. It effects server community and spawn rates, and whether or not u need a dynamic respawn system. On top of the technical reasons, sharding in the starting zones is intended to help with mob spawn rates in the beginning, to prevent players being totally pushed out of questing areas by groups and questing being devolved into a toxic mess of tagging.
---
And in my experience the tourism effect is absolutely real. The launch of  every multiplayer game in my experience starts with a large peak on the first few days of launch which declines (usually logarithmically) until the population stabilizes to the normal concurrency. These effects are accentuated by the availability of the internet and everyone receiving games at the same time with digital releases. The unknowns in this case are what the final concurrency will end up for an individual realm, and how quickly it takes to stabilize. The fact that it will happen is known though, and I can say for certain that it will happen. 
---
Blizzard knows this and thats why they're suggesting sharding only the starting zones for a limited time. If they were to shard until lvl 20, that, in my opinion, will likely cover less than 3 days of time before the bulk of average players are running around the lvl 20 zones. Thats a reasonable timeframe to stabilize to me, but I'm not sure for the situation at the scale of WoW. I really do think that they want to minimize the time spent in sharded zones for classic though, otherwise they would have just said they were going to shard everything for a week, would have started a riot in that case.
---
If you think there's absolutely no chance that mara won't be on launch you're the one that's delusional. Just because a few dumbass redditors can't entertain the idea that things might come out differently than they've been thinking doesn't mean they're correct. The fact that you can't understand the difference between saying there's a chance and that it's 100% going to be the case just shows what a dumbass you are.
---
Dwarf rogue... just looks ridiculous
---
Was Muhammad a HWL?
---
A lot of people grew up and moved away from video games as a whole. College, work, family etc
---
There is no perfect class in wow. You have to find the one with the flaws you can live with. The reason I’m playing a warrior is I like the ease of getting in 5 man groups. Shamans are great support class that can heal and aren’t terrible solo. But if you group with a warrior as a shaman and quest you unlock the magic of windfury synergy. You and your warrior will slaughter. But shamans can’t keep pace with a pure dps class in vanilla that’s their biggest flaw. A warriors biggest flaw is they cost a lot to gear up and use consumables but they are competitive in all their roles.
---
as long as view distance is limited to classic levels, IDGAF about all the other classic levels, let me crank that shit as high as possible.
---
Damn. An optimal version would be great. I’m trying to save some money
---
I remember glitching through the world and falling into nothingness forever, but I still had my forward momentum.  Enough forward momentum to discover a zone I hadn't been to yet and DING off that delicous discovery XP.   Probably the best level I ever gained.
---
Cata is when I got into a serious relationship. Needless to say, that ended my WoW days. lol.
---
My current girlfriend is a little more forgiving... so with that said -- Classic, here I come!!
---
I like it
---
I would've said no, when i heard of the sequel to Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines which got announced. But then i remember how white wolf went full tumblrina SJW with the tabletop.
---
discord really has cornered the market but making it good, free, and accessible
---
True, but that falls back on the hunter as well because if he has his pet attacking a target that the tank has already taunted but isn’t focusing on, the pet could draw the mob away, and, in the case of a warrior or Druid tank, take away some rage generation as well.
---
Lemme get them key bindings menus boi.
---
It is a blood elf though
---
Without a doubt
---
In my case it was pure burnout. Became irritable every time I logged in - like going to a job you hate. I remember when they had a free weekend sometime during MoP. I lasted less than 10 minutes. Didn’t come back until Legion.
---
It probably is that first Ragnarok defeat, took my guild a good while to do and was just such an epic counter won with many hours of hard work and dedicated team effort. It also got me my trusted and cherished perditions blade.  
---
A close contender is the many times me and my guilds raiding rogues went on a rampage in ironforge. Just felt special, spending so many hours talking in the guilds rogue chat, getting our awesome tier sets and then rampaging. We would jump some guy near the auction house, then jump down below. Usually 1-2 would follow, thinking they'd be heroes. What they didn't bargain for was that there were 3 more rogues, ready to ambush insta kill anyone foolish enough to do so.   
---
It wasn't about skill or anything, nor griefing. In todays retail i am 2k-2.5k arena xp with every class but druid, but events like the above just dont happen on todays retail. We imagined ourselves a bunch of ninjas terrorizing the server, all the while feeling like giddy schoolgirls laughing our asses off.
---
After leveling to 60 on a private server as the faction with a considerably smaller population than the other- I'm definitely going PVE. I work 40 hours a week, have a toddler and a family, and other shit to do. 
---
I really do not want my experience in whatever limited time I have to be decided by some random no lifer who wants to one shot/camp/grief me. Ive played on both types and have experienced WPvP on both and I really dont feel like I will be missing out on much. Definitely wont miss losing world buffs in BRS as I'm zoning in.
---
Imagine playing Super Mario Bros, and on the third zone an invincible Bowser shows up and kills you, and continues to do so for 30 min. You have zero chance of beating him or this level. Is that fun? I get that playing on a PvP server this is expected. But that doesn't mean that it isnt shitty being on the opposite side of it.
---
I want to play WoW and enjoy myself and not let any one else (at least during the leveling process) have a chance to make my day worse because they feel like it. PVE all day baby- maybe even RP
---
This is weird because it brought to mind an idea I had completely forgotten about. 
---
Being broke enough you had to decide which skills to train right away and which could wait.
---
We don't know what kind of addons will work. They haven't said but they did say they were looking into things that would be too powerful to allow and disallowing them.
---
I should add the caveat that I’m focusing more on dungeons and groups while leveling and not necessarily at raiding levels
---
People don't really want to watch the same thing over and over. Variety will do more for you than class selection. Play a class that is hard to kill in the open world like paladin/hunter/druid and take herbalism, mining or both.
---
Did you ever give bans or warnings to people doing false reports to try and get others in trouble?
---
The only game I’d say I was more hyped for was Star Wars the old republic. And for like 4 months or so it actually met my hype and I’d say I enjoyed that time as much as I loved vanilla. Now I’m super hyped for classic but I have to temper that expectation because I don’t have nearly the same free time as before and I’m unsure how different it will be socially. 
---
The internet is a way different place than it was 15 years ago, meme and troll culture are far more rampant and people will be going extra ridiculous trying to be “nostalgic” except it will feel anything BUT nostalgic when straight away trade chat is an unreadable wall of anal thunderfuries and barrens chat is getting more norris jokes in 5 minutes than it used to get in a day.
---
So I’m excited and hopeful, but prepared for it not having the magic that it could. Here’s hoping that we don’t end up ruining that which we so much desire, lol.
---
Warlock T3 is like a raid boss. Takes coordination to kill.
---
Did you have any interaction with the well known Blizzard guys?(Morhaime, Metzen, Pardo, Didier, etc.)
---
How about the lesser known people, like Tseric or Coreiel?
---
Depends on spec. But generally Warlock perhaps.
---
The demo didn't have a view distance slider, looks like this build doesn't either. I was worried about this as well but I think we're good

Tauren hunter is the worst choice on horde for minmaxy stuff, however aesthetically I really like it. 
---
Undead warrior isn’t great compared to orc or tauren or troll either.

Oh, I also HATED the underwater zone with the hot fire of a thousand suns.

They did tests on pilots, maybe during WW2? They were able to identify photos of specific planes and models with the photo flashing at as high as 1 in 1000 frames IIRC. (perceiving a flash isn't exactly the same as detecting motion but yeah)
---
Cata is actually the expansion that I went hardest on at the start. Made the level cap within the first day or so, not long after the first Shaman on the server to get it. Maxed professions, farmed all Heroic/Craftable Epics, fully geared for raiding. Guild didn't want me for main/core raid group, and didn't have a second one set up. So I gquit and started puging with one of the better guilds on the server at the time, but never got a guild invite, and they stopped bringing me after a few more of their people caught up. Stopped playing not long after that. Did get to kill the first 2 or 3 bosses in the first raid.
---
Tried WoD, similar but not as hardcore on the leveling. Got removed from my raid because I was the lowest HPS. I mean, someone has to be the lowest, and Shamans were not the best healers, never really were in terms of HPS, always been healing + utility, not full on HPS like a paladin or something. I think the rest of them more or less knew each other IRL and were looking for someone to blame that they wiped a few times on the second boss in the first raid on their first attempt at the raid. It was like, 4 wipes on a brand new boss that none of us had ever done. That was the last time I played wow. I honestly barely remember anything about leveling up or any of that for WoD. I remember the first boss in the arena, and we were wiping to an earth elemental of some kind I think?
---
I bind the camera to shift + mouse wheels. I use the camera in different positions quite often so I feel it's worth making it still easy to access.

Yah, dont tell blizzard though, cause I might get banned for playing catch with my dad. Fuck food you are really opening up my eyes here. Basically dont do anything in game, dont let blizzard know you exist. Dont let anyone know you exist and dont even get a blizzard account.

I'm going to fake my own death here shortly. Actually what's the point. I may as well just kill myself knowing what I know now.

Been a long time since vanilla. If you have any more, bring 'em.
---
Not quite. Vanilla World of Warcraft is my most hyped/anticipated game of all time. I spent the entire year of 2004 obsessing over it. As soon as the Alpha client leaked and the first sandbox servers were online, I was there. I even became a GM on one of those servers, Vibe, and spent endless hours researching and spawning mobs in starting areas trying to create a semi-playable experience. Made my own guild, and ended up borrowing a WoW beta account and getting to level 59 before release. I was a Blizzard fanboy and saw the game for the greatness it was and couldn't have been more right. 
---
Here I am again, for it's re-release, absorbing every possible resource for the game, practicing speedruns, etc. There's just nothing else like it.
---
For 5 mans anything works, you don't even need an actual tank if your group is decent.
---
For raids warriors is your only real choice.
---
There are some valid arguments for bears, but most people will just stick with warriors.
---
Thanks man! :D
---
I remember steamrolling Wrath dungeons. I remember entenring the first Cata heroics and wiping gloriously over and over.  
---
Then I remember they nerfed tf out of those dungeons and there was I, steamrolling them again. I also remember not being able to have a raiding schedule.  
---
The game got boring and I stopped.
---
Rogues could evasion tank gruul in tbc if I’m not mistaken
---
You can watch me :D going to be the main tank for the guild &lt;Participation Totems&gt;
---
The guy you replied to is talking about world pvp.
---
SOMETHINGS HAPPENING!

This whole sub-reddit is going to try to tell me that a powerful mage, duel wielding fireballs and fighting off the legion on top of Karazhan is not Medivh?!
---
You're very welcome!

Graphics and visuals are part of the experience as Art. Dial up and Net Zero were barriers between experiencing the game, not a way of experiencing. The graphics as they were was not in the way of experiencing the game as it was meant to be experienced.
---
&gt;Just because a few dumbass redditors can't entertain the idea that things might come out differently than they've been thinking doesn't mean they're correct.
---
It's not what we have been thinking, it's what has been confirmed by Blizz. 
---
&gt;  The fact that you can't understand the difference between saying there's a chance and that it's 100%  
---
I understand the difference, but there is no chance. That's what everyone has been trying to tell you.

&gt; just shows what a dumbass you are

Just shows how pathetic you are.

**Recruiting easy going Alliance players for mainly PvE on a PvP server.**  
---
We're just a dozen players so far, but we're creating a fun loving guild with the main goal of clearing Naxx in a very civilized time frame.
---
We want to explore every facet of Classic World of Warcraft, without feeling like it's become a 2nd job.
---
One of Platinum Wow's [recent videos about his plans for Vanilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRmITed6rjk) is exactly the spirit of players we're trying to bring together.
---
All members right now are in the EDT Timezone (UTC -4) and speak primarily english but we are accepting players from all timezones and will ideally coordinate raiding for anyone and everyone across the globe.
---
The most important quality we're looking for is a relaxed attitude to Warcraft. Our guild motto is "Have fun and wipe often". We expect to fail many many boss encounters, and failure in this guild is not just tolerated, but enjoyed and appreciated as a reminder of how amazing and difficult this game really is.
---
If you're interested, please message me with the following information and if we think you'll enjoy your time in the guild, you will be added to our discord channel where we plan and congregate before release.
---
Planned Main Race/Class/Spec:Planned Alts (if any):

I don’t remember now which goes to show how insignificant it was. I remember I rolled a new character to play the changed Azeroth and then an old char maybe made it to 85 questing and a few 5 mans.
---
Good tip! Thanks.
---
Looks good but one thing I think is being overlooked is that with only pictures of skills and no names, people who haven't played a class before will have no idea what the skills actually are and no easy way to look them up.
---
Right on. At least I’m not alone in this!
---
Not a fair comparison. 
---
Warlocks wear plate (it feels like it at least) and mages wear twill gear.
---
time to dust off my 17'inch monitor and go 720p
---
I would stay in the guild. I'm sure it must be fun and who knows, maybe they would influence you to become a doctor, a nurse or something else!
---
That's pretty smart.
---
Apparently you get 4% hit if you're a Tailor in addition to the 2% Crit everyone receives from the set. It's the 4% extra hit bonus that makes this set so OP.

9 is the last great FF. It felt like a mix of all the stuff I loved about previous titles. My all time fav being FF6 by a long shot.

It was likely based off concept art for a place that never made it into game.   
---
Trailers lie.  All the time.

&gt; For raids, warriors is your only real choice.

I'd say that druids are more than [viable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alH2QXm8MM8).
---
It was after cata, which was the first sign of blizz making bad products.
---
At 16, you should stayed in and asked relevent medical questions, like will jerking off make you go blind, does jerking off make your hands hairy, does jerking off reduce your sperm count.....you know all the important medical questions for a 16 year old.

Lol you sound like you’re salty because you missed out on some other betas. There aren’t enough streamers to populate the beta, even if there were calm your ass down it’s just a beta.

You can also probably buy wow tokens off retail and add the subscription time to your account, which would give you access to both classic and BfA.
---
No it did not. On release day everyone started at 1

Mage sounds pretty good for survivabillity, but if you don't want to be cloth, then meh
---
This video compares bears and warriors from a guy who has tanked Naxx with both:
---
https://youtu.be/mNGo5SMeqgo
---
Warriors are certainly more complex. His other videos can explain.
---
Bartending student? I didn't know there was a program...
---
That’s ok, it’s not for everyone.
---
Yep, and warriors pay more for repairs. That’s the trade-off of fewer skills to buy
---
Rofl, okay. Have fun being a chode.
---
Wait wait wait wait... are they giving put beta codes rn or something?
---
If we went by that definition, pretty much everything a primary profession makes could be put onto the list. Maybe I should specify what I mean by benefit. I mean those things that directly make your character more powerful or versatile. As great as getting more gold is, gold does nothing outside of its ability to be exchanged for other things. It is an indirect benefit.
---
You are right that stuff like the Mooncloth cooldown and Salt Shaker cooldown would go into an evaluation of what profession to pick. This list is not about a total evaluation of all the things that make professions valuable, but only those items and effects you absolutely can't get without having a specific profession skill.
---
He was, and forever will be, the Guardian of the Horde to me.
---
Warlock. So much stam and CC that they can keep damaging through. Felhunter can really fuck a caster too. Warlock generally takes more skill to pull off too though, like using your pet effectively.
---
It was partially done, just not final
---
They are manually remaking the lightings and stuff so it can't be 100% the same there will always be differences
---
You mean we won't see thunderfurry rogues :)
---
the thinking is wanting to play vanilla not vanilla remastered
---
at least as far as tye character models i prefered them before they got reworked.
---
https://youtu.be/ODO8SPvv4Uk

tbh ill prob use both the classic and modern settings , maybe leveling ill go non classic then back to classic at max

I can confirm desktop is fine, so it’s just mobile doing that. No worries I’ll download at home! :)

yo this is dope! ill definitely use this when classic comes out
---
Forget trading cards.  I want the Blizzcon loot.  Gimme my Murky!!!
---
&gt; Not to preserve
---
except they literally stated that it's a preservation project
---
"cloth-gay"? i didnt realize this game was going to literally take us back to 2004
---
We need RPPVP or it isn't WoW.
---
Sure. For example, some of the engineering things may realistically be so complex that most of the people in Azeroth would not be able to use them. From a realism point of view, having Engineering skill requirements on some of those things would make sense.
---
I know everyone is saying warlock but just judging by classic wow PvP videos I feel like mages are more fearsome.
---
Sure warlocks are harder to kill but mages just delete you. Even deep frost T3 PvP is lethal as hell. Cone of cold hits for like 1100
---
The players on RPPVP realms can type in complete sentences.   
---
The players on RPPVP realms aren't afraid to fight.

the female dwarf animations are so bad i refuse to play one

No refesh rate option? Honestly I can't go back to 60hz..

As an older gamer there hasnt been many games that has got my hype up as much as Classic. The first time was when I got my brand new snes with SF2 bundled with it. The main one though was ocarina of Time on the N64 after reading all the hype of the game for about a year on the official nintendo magazine I had to get the game on release and so I did. My parents took me very early in the morning to the store and I was in a queue of fellow gamers waiting for it to open :p OoT certainly didnt disappoint. But after that there wasnt much for me to get hyped up about. I did play vanilla WoW at release but I wouldnt say I was hyped for it at the time since i was playing semi serious counter strike and I'd never played an MMO and it was only when clanmates started playing and telling me how good it was did I join in and 1400 days played on my main later WoW is not feeling great anymore - I want to go back to its former greatness which is why im super hyped for classic now.
---
Oh I also had hype for D3 but we all know how that turned out.
---
Yep.  We were there, and we remember.
---
We all remember ED.
---
I actually listened to the whole episode and it was great.  Nice work!
---
Am I pushing the friendship if I asked you to rank them all from most expensive to least? 
---
I have some low IQ friends who think their rogues have a tough life compared to my shaman.
---
Farming Essence of Water in Felwood as a 51 rogue, a 60 rogue (same faction) with a Chinese name shows up and starts outfarming me while spamming duel requests. I decline like 10 times then suddenly get an idea. I leave the next duel request open and let him tag like 5 elementals while at half health. I then hit accept, blow every fucking cooldown I have and rip into him. 
---
I win the "duel", he falls to his knees in the begging pose, and the elementals kill him outright.
---
I then finish the elementals off, get my final essence of the night, /point &amp; /laugh for a few minutes and hearth.
---
It's as close as you can get to murdering someone in your own faction.
---
I don't think you should be worried about sperm count at 16
---
Lol or you just discovered reddit yet have opinions on Classic WoW which would be equally hilarious
---
Something's not quite right...
---
Watching my wife (hunter) solo and kite Prince Malchezaar on top of Kharazan.  The other 9 were dead including me...what I'm sure was less than a minute seemed like an eternity of stress and hearts racing....but she got him.  We almost broke vent with all the cheers.

Skarm has said multiple times Druid tanks only fit specific bosses and are the inferior tank by a wide margin in comparison to warriors. Druids are viable but there isn’t a reason to choose one over a warrior other than armor value

Gnomish vs goblin?

and wasnt there 2 blacksmith options?

Windfury + frost shock makes for happy warriors
---
Every time a new fresh vanilla server came out that I was going to play on, I would always take the day off from work and start playing the minute the server comes online and play with some of my siblings. It's always a great time
---
In this case you actually have someone asking a legitimate (if unanswerable) question in, perhaps, a clumsy way and everybody treating him like he's retarded. 
---
There's no reason to assume with 100% certainty that Blizzard's phases will have every piece of content released immediately.
---
Crushim got feared into the whelps...
---
Ah yes, a man who truly understands.
---
Enjoy classic and may your empty window’s key slot never be filled with hair and chip crumbs.
---
Graphics are going to be as good as retail? And with new models?
---
I still think that funniest thing is that druids have only BR and dont have simple resurrect

Winterspring saber is alliance only. No horde equal
---
I used to just death grip it out of their lol. 
---
You can usually get enough torque on it if you start on the top side of the key.
---
hmmmmm i dunno i was VERY hyped for Age of Conan release.  me and my 2 MMO buddies were pretty bored of WoW at the time and AoC looked so damn good  
---
it mostly lived up to my hype.  Epic setting, beautiful visuals, fun abilities/classes, such great areas, a lot of the gear looked really epic.  Hands down the best lvl 1-20 in any MMO by an extremely long way.  some of the dungeons were incredible.  the talent trees had nice variety, and there were also super-class trees (e.g. bear shamans, tempests of set and priests of mitra had a grouped talent tree that they all shared which they had in addition to their individual class trees)
---
unfortunately they just didn't seem to have the time to finish it.  the last 8-10 levels were pure grind cos no there wasn't really any content, there was a massive lack of certain types of gear (i wore a brown leather kilt for about 50 levels, the stats just changed occasionally), talents and certain stats seemed like they weren't thought out or tested very much.  for a while a certain barbarian (think arms warrior in leather) talent gave them a ranged attack that stunned the target for like 5 seconds and did preposterous amounts of damage.   I made good use of it haha
---
Ooh look at mr. Fancy Pants that's not stuck on dial-up
---
I remember rogues being broken-good in the TBC pre-patch. I don't know the exact mechanics of what was going on, but they could just annihilate you if they got the drop on you and you were wearing cloth. 
---
I remember one AV where one rogue got the drop on my priest when I was guarding a tower and I lived. I posted about it in zone chat: "lol worst rogue ever they got the opener on me and I lived" and everyone agreed that this was indeed lol-worthy and they must indeed have been the worst rogue ever.
---
So this might say more about pre-patch rogues than anything else.
---
&gt;attention is fleeting.
---
I think this forum is proof of the falsity of that statement.
---
Entirely depends on the person. Played a shaman on a pserver and got yelled at pretty badly for rolling and winning Herod's Helm. Like why else would I be in Arms? XP? HA. You think I level with my resto gear? 26ap, mail AND 1% crit? No way I'm not rolling. 
---
Other than that, if it looks like someone in the group needs a piece of gear more than I do (and it has a silly drop rate, Robes of Arugal I'm looking at you) then I'll usually pass on it so it's one less person fighting for it.
---
Although I would get a bit mad if a warrior rolled on say, leggings of the fang because so many classes roll on that pants (rogues, druids, hunters, shamans). Don't need no mail users at 20 rolling on them as well. Which is why you try to optimize your group as best as you can, making it diverse so if that low % item does drop, easier time ya know?
---
Well, the “ultra” water looks like shit based on the last beta. It’s too shiny and reflective, it looks like mercury. Also more foliage density doesn’t necessarily look good as it can make everything look cluttered with crap. That said, I wouldn’t mind sharper textures and better shadows and lighting as long as they don’t change any of the models.
---
Wasn't sure on this one was hoping there was a way for horde to obtain that's disappointing, I'll edit it thank you.
---
d3 was good enough for me to make my money back and then some on the rmah lol
---
lol you were able to just buy items off the gold ah and flip them for reald world money it was a fun experience being paid to game
---
&gt; We’ll launch Classic with content from original WoW through patch 1.2.x 
---
&gt; Our first phase primarily focuses on launching Classic with Onyxia and Molten Core, but we’ve decided to hold off on Dire Maul for a while. Maraudon is still in the first phase, because it was originally released on December 18, 2004, just two weeks after the first player hit level 60, 
---
&gt;**Phase 1 (Classic** ***Launch*****)**  
---
&gt;Molten Core  
---
&gt;Onyxia  
---
&gt;Maraudon
---
Yeah, super ambiguous. Just as bad as OP.
---
I'd say wc3 reforged or star Citizen :3
---
There are sections within Engineering for Gnomish and Goblin specs. Blacksmithing has several specializations - armor vs weapon, and weapon further specializes into axe, hammer or sword. However, the only profession exclusive item I found within the BS specs was the Dark Iron Plate for armorsmithing.
---
As far as I know, none of the other specs have anything only they can use. If you know of any, please let me know!
---
Yeah, I'm having a hard time deciding. The server population will make a big difference though, I'm used to the mega pop of private servers where you can't go anywhere without running into the enemy faction, at blizzlike numbers like 3k it wouldn't really be an issue.
---
Better support 120Hz or I'll be real sad.

This dumb ass lol

This is a nice sentiment, but nostalgia and hype will only keep you invested when classic launched for so long until it runs out. Loving the game is why I will stay invested, and most certainly would jump on the chance to beta test the classic wow servers.
---
I get angry just thinking about how bad DKs were.
---
I cant wait to get a cheap 500 dollar laptop and play classic at work. 
---
Down side. I work EMS so I'll probabbly just make million alts and never get anything real done
---
Warlock T3 is a different story
---
They scale a lot with gear.
---
So definitely warlock.
---
Holy shit that’s the video!!! Lmao you just gave me one of my white whales
---
Man I gotta watch it again and see if it’s how I remember it
---
Thanks for the reply! Another commenter posted the video I was referring to btw :)
---
Those cooldown are quite unique in their ability to generate *passive* gold, but you're right that it's not a special ability that alters your gameplay or character's abilities.
---
Is the software for this specific to your keyboard or a generally downloadable application?
---
Yes this is true was answered at blizzcon, aoe is most likely best xp/h but you need level 35/40 and a shield spike. This is however only the cases if you can find a aoe grinding spot. At launch I think deep ret and questing will be the fastest to level 60
---
This gets lost a lot nowadays. The d3 salvage was incredible.
---
I rocked these wallpapers forever, they're so good.
---
Is this even a serious question
---
I think it'd work better if Gallywix was bored looking at BFA, and an ordinary goblin (what with there not being a Gallywix in classic) smiling at classic.
---
It's synapse 3 for Razer keyboards. But I'm sure there's other applications out there that aren't brand dependent.
---
Worth adding since it was removed later.  
---
Glad I still wear mine.

Getting Ashjre'thul off Chromag after months of waiting.

Everyone was so excited for me and our RL slow-rolled me SO HARD when it did finally drop. I was so freaking happy! I made good use of that weapon. It was such a gamechanger in PvP and PvE. Melted mages in PvP and my raiding DPS in Naxx stayed respectable thanks to that wep! Crushed all my noob hunter buddies on the meters... that is for sure!
---
I have never seen a more beautifully crafted sentence in my life
---
Skyrim. Played the fuck out of Morrowind and Oblivion. They rolled out those live actions ads with a dragon attacking Whiterun and I was all about it.
---
Nelf priest. Animations are horrendous
---
I think he had goblin engineering as one of his professions.
---
People still thinking the nights were much different than BfA. FeelsWeirdMan.
---
Nothing is kept from the beta.
---
No just like the original beta all toons will be wiped.
---
second time it's been asked in a couple hours.  If your progress would carry over, it would be called early access.  Every bit of anything you do will be absolutely wiped out.
---
Your face is facetious.
---
I'm not quite sure if the image is a female human, or blood elf. She does have the annoying hip-shot stance that the blood elf females tend to have when idle, but the ears are missing. But the ears might be hidden by the helmet. Also, she seems a bit thin for the human female.
---
As an alliance you can go and buyout frost oil recipe from the merchant on the walls of the alterac ruins. You need frost oil later for a quest in badlands and you can make a money from it.
---
This bullshit claim has already been disproved many times.
---
People do [this](https://blog.wooting.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Soft-landing-pad-installen.jpg) to silence their keycaps ([article](https://blog.wooting.nl/sound-dampen-your-mechanical-keyboard-noises/)). Why not expand on the technique and make it difficult to fully press? 
---
So that's a foam or rubber bit cut and inserted into the keycap or around the stem of the keyboard switch.
---
Either Classic or Warhammer Online.

Being a lazy rank10 Tauren Warrior in AB. My premade would usually steamroll the other team unless it was also a premade, so 90% of the time I'd just sit at lumberbill and 'guard' it.
---
If it got hairy I'd parachute off(noggenfogger? I forget) into the middle.
---
I believe it is the other way around. The 3/3 set bonus gives you +2% spell crit, and requires you to maintain Tailoring 300.
---
This thread is pointless, as pointed out in the comments, but they sure are hilarious to read. Thanks for the laughs everyone.
---
We dont actually know until blizzard announces the beta
---
They have not told us much about the beta but its unlikley progression would be retained
---
Its in the realm of possibility they could let you keep up to level 20 just so every player does not login in the same zone but very unlikely
---
Nah, GTA: San Andreas was. I was literally jumping up and down as I was putting that disc in the first time.
---
This was my favorite and most played game though, and will be again. :)
---
Damn that sucks. Why are people so excited then? 
---
People really wanna level twice over. I dont know how you guys stay sane
---
Maybe if your talking about doing solo DM tribute or mara runs as a hunter lol
---
For a lot of players back in the day it was a lot. The most expensive item I ever bought in Vanilla wow was the Pattern for Robes of the Void for my sisters birthday present. I think I spend 150g? Maybe I am wrong it was a long time ago. But that pattern is right I could be wrong about the cost. 
---
Like a lot of people, I was kinda bad at the game back then.
---
SWTOR for me but we all know how that turned out.
---
No, the hit is on the pieces, the set bonus is the crit for tailors only
---
Noggenfogger is 35s for 5, not each.
---
Great thing about the better knowledge is MC wont take forever anymore. Id venture to say a Prebis group could easily clear MC in 2-3 hours. Assuming everyone knew what to do. And from what I have learned as gear becomes better and better MC can be brought down to about an hour in AQ+ gear
---
That makes more sense to level to 20.
---
That is what I will be excited for
---
Sorry I checked last 5 pages and even searched and didnt see any posts
---
Ahh my bad. I'll delete my comment so as to not spread misinformation.
---
Being able to Mine up Arcane Crystals is an exclusive benefit of Mining
---
Reasons to be excited for Beta not related to leveling: seeing how the game runs on your rig, dicking around with character creator, reconvening with friends and getting the feel for the game again, trying out classes/races you haven't played before committing to one on release, legitimately interested in improving the game by scoping out bugs/glitches...
---
Nice! Any chance I could persuade you to make a version of this without including rank upgrades? :)
---
 I mean my hearts beating! MY HEARTS BEATING! My hands are shaking! MY HANDS ARE SHAKING! BUT I'M STILL TANKING! I'M STILL GETTING SHIELD BLOCKS! It's like BOOM SHIELD BLOCK! BOOM SHIELD BLOCK!
---
Aaaaand another bookmark. I have more info saved to my bookmark bar than I think even existed in all of Vanilla wow at this point.
---
ok but do you know if our levels from the beta will carry over to real game?
---
They might like that
---
Entering Ashenvale for the first time as a level 20 Night Elf Druid and coming across the first Horde I’ve ever seen, an Orc Warrior! A real enemy player! I had just gotten cat form, and jumped into stealth. I stalked him until the right moment when I pounced! He didn’t even know what hit him. And that’s when I got hooked - my first gank.
---
Dude I love you and think your awesome!!
---
Do you know what a beta is??
---
We've even been able to detect change blindness and perform tests swapping text without the viewer noticing during these moments. Crazy!
---
But yeah - the eye technically doesn't have a set limit. Some folks can't see a difference but when you can, even slower paced games look nicer at higher framerates.
---
Priests are enlightened.
---
Source: Me, mained priest in vanilla.
---
I just deleted five level 55s to make more levelling practise space
---
Yea that makes sense. Forgot people still dont know what they wanna play lmfao
---
I disagree. Would really appreciate a version with these added some day. I play rogue and never know what levels to check for new class quests.
---
Bunch of hauty, opinionated keyboard abusers up in this bitch.
---
They've probably been removed.
---
Absolutely not.  Again,  Every bit of anything you do will be absolutely wiped out.  You will start all over when the game is released.
---
You do not use SoW for leveling, and if you think you do and will, you are in for a supprise.
---
I'm not 100% sure those accounts were only being banned by us, but Warden worked in mysterious ways.  There were a lot of instances where we did catch them and took them out of the game ourselves.  Warden did catch things because I had gotten tickets that lead me to accounts with Warden notations on them, but how why and when I have no idea.
---
Hard to say on this one, if a player is caught visibly hacking and the GM sees it is probably the most clear cut case.  If they have reason to believe you are hacking but can't prove it, there is a lot more gray area.
---
All of the GMs took tickets across all servers!  The exception being it was considered frowned upon to take a ticket on a server you played for, so that very rarely happened, although sometimes out of necessity.
---
Oof, so much alliance only stuff with no horde equivalent.
---
it's hard to say because i can remember how hyped I was for burning crusade. flying mounts just was crazy to think about at the time
---
Being able to mine up Copper Ore is also an exclusive benefit of Mining, but that isn't what the thread is about.
---
I thought troll was the min max choice for pve rogues? Or is orc better cause blood rage?
---
Yea man the discord I'm in thats the only question they ask
---
As much as everyone hates it, I am still hyped for every WoW expansion. Those first few weeks of FRESH content and experiencing it with everyone is always fun. I get hyped, but am very picky with other MMO launches and the last amazing launch experience was BDO. That game was fucking AMAZING for about 6 months. It was just different enough from WoW to provide an epic sense of discovery I hadn't had in a long time. Everyone was so lost for the first weeks and it was amazing. Albion Online launch is an honorable mention but that game burned out pretty quick.
---
This is all talking about a benefit for a couple dozen quests and less than a week worth of play.  A VAST majority of the time the druid will be superior in every way
---
It's human isn't it? Don't belfs, mile long eye brows stick out of helmets anyway? On my male belf they do.
---
Yea it was all kinds of bad ahaha.  Shame since the raid leader guy was decent and used to be part of my pick up group raids.
---
Fixed
---
Added
---
Warlock in T3.
---
It was a joke back then that if you managed to assemble a raid to beat one you beat the game.
---
Exactly, I used to casual raid AQ40 and early Naxx as 31/8/12 on my Rogue. Wasn't ideal but wasn't really practical to respec like it is now.
---
I'm jealous!!  that's a lot of beautiful country to see. 
---
If you want more to think about after you choose a class dream up what macros you want to make.
---
People are just excited the beta is coming out, half the people won't even play much of it it is just the mile stone. People have wanted this for year, the fact that its happening and coming this close to release is a big deal.
---
If progress would have been kept from a beta most people would likely considered it damn near game ruining for how badly it would impact launch
---
its very unlikley but its one of the options i was thinking about to reduce loggin day quest bottlenecks
---
no one knows how the beta will work till they tell us
---
mgs5 was not a flop lmao
---
I hope you mean male. Female nelf priests have one of the best animations.
---
These two trailers are so magical.
---
https://youtu.be/ByFhCalvSns
---
lmao
---
That is a pretty memorable level!  And you were definitely finding some undiscovered territory!
---
If was actually kind of funny because every now and again you would get a ticket like 'I fell through the world in Ironforge' and you would see their location and it would say Winterspring or something and you just wondered 'how on earth...'
---
This is correct. Technically, but very misleading.
---
You’re not informing the OP of the right information.
---
“It is the best DPS weapon in the game” applicable through end of naxx. Hands down. Full stop. Like you said, “only with the charges”. So a dedicated kitty Druid would have 15-20 of these farmed for a week of raiding.
---
It beats the AQ40 Druid mace w/ offhand. It’s the best, it just sucks to farm it all day on non-raiding days.
---
TLDR: CDP is the best feral weapon in vanilla. Even after all content cleared
---
I haven't been following this much lately, but is there any indication that this is actually going to release...ever?
---
I've missed running to the trainer to see what was available now, and not being able to afford it yet and having to work for skills.
---
Did they include pet abilities? Could explain it.
---
How days have changed
---
Lol what are the chances haha good stuff
---
Surprised that Warlocks are the ones hitting the books the hardest. Isn't the whole point you get to be OP without studying like those nerdy mages?
---
SWG (pre-nge is still the best MMO ever) then TBC.  I'm not sure what number 3 would be, maybe Fallout NV.  I'm excited about Classic WoW, and hopeful, but I'm also a bit cautious, we'll see how it goes.
---
Super high skill level in bgs then is not what it is now. I did this too, the same team day in, day out. I honestly think the high level BGs will be a different beast now.
---
Getting our first Nefarion kill and being server first on Horde to do it was an awesome feeling. Getting full Tier 2 was awesome as well.
---
Nice effort! As a fellow "complete list" maker I had to upvote ^^
---
Under the "~Player Made Pets~" heading, you may be missing some, or either one of us may have some bad spellings. Let me give you my list of engineering pets, so we can compare.
---
* Mechanical Squirrel
---
* Lil' Smoky
---
* Pet Bombling
---
* Lifelike Mechanical Toad
---
* Tranquil Mechanical Yeti
---
This subreddit sometimes lol
---
I don't know if downranking spells is a healthy way for WoW to be played for the long run, but it was a big change after people were used to it.
---
It's a different fucking game.  The industry standard for a monthly sub is 15 dollars.   You would be paying 15 dollars whether its attached to retail or not.  Stop being cheap.
---
As I said, I'm not sure. And that hip-shot stance is one of the things I really hate about blood elves. My memory may be faulty, but I don't recall that stance for human females. And I don't know what that helm hides. When I play, I usually hide the helmet because I think most of 'em are hideous.
---
*smiles in 1024x768*
---
The only time you might do a ban for a false report is if they incriminated themselves as a part of the report.
---
It happened a few times I can remember where the person who reported another player was in fact the person who said what was reported, typically being called a name or something.
---
we definitely discouraged false reports and if we for any reason had reason to believe people were trying to trick us we would warn them.  Every now and again you will find someone telling their guild they are about to petition in and try and trick us... and then you are read the  ticket and see what they told to their guild... That is taking time away from real players problems, not cool.
---
Looks like they went with this idea and you were wrong all salong.
---
9.5/10. If you included total gold cost for each class it would be God tier. But I know you're making this for free so I still upvoted!
---
I’m not sure what you’re trying to ask/say. You’ve described how it will work as near as we can tell, which I don’t think is controversial.
---
Like what? Alliance has one more mount.
---
Unfortunately that would be... d3.
---
Well that's fucking sexy.
---
Definitely! Most hyped ever!
---
Been waiting for this game since 2013 when I realized eventually it would have to happen. Just a matter of time 😊
---
So change nothing about this going forward. Gotcha.
---
Nice catch! I accidentally used the npc names instead of the item names for some of those pets.
---
Just out of curiosity what other lists do you have if you would mind sharing that would be great!
---
Why wouldn't it be? This sub sometimes
---
[Elvui for classic](https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4282)

This is absolutely false.  I was able to hit 60 during the first quest in WPL by completing all of the dungeon quests available pre BRD.
---
And this was during patch 1.2
