Good thing you can't do Night Elf Mage...or we would be calling it Portable Moonwell. :V

---
It's not elitism if it is true.
---
Classic has the social element that everything front Cata afterwards did not.
---
Hobbs? 
---

---
Now that‚Äôs a name I haven‚Äôt heard in quite some time.
---
It would have to be up to Blizzard to handle the logistics of it, whether thats more realms or whatever, but other games seem to be able to manage it.
---
Private servers are tuned-up, it's not that Classic is tuned-down.
---
Funnily enough, the Dark Iron allied race in BfA has a stealth animation closer to Vanilla.
---
That‚Äôs the one.  Had a twilight moment there for a few.  Thought I was losing my mind.
---
They attacked in cata as well. I used to kite ?? Alliance elites in Ashenvale to ogrimmar and make whoever was the leader at the time tank the nelf while everyone around died from her aoe
---
I'm happy to see that. I originally made that comment when the top comment was just someone saying "/rclassicwow" and it seemed like the post would die in new. Glad to see those guys turned out to be the minority
---
I love when a Hobbs clip shows up in a Trolden reel. Usually Cho is involved lol.
---
Didn't know he played wow
---
I understand they were testing, and Blizzard is fully aware of the bugs, but many people in the sub are under the false impression that layering is something completely new.
---
Now don't get me wrong, the way they are used is very different, but it's still the same tech. Being on a different shard is equivalent to being on a different layer from the server's perspective. They are two names for the same thing, a virtual server. The way in which players interact with them is where the difference lies.
---
I got math to do, and leveling routes to perfect.
---
Yes. Yes I would.
---
Looks like a horoscope. Just vague enough for everyone to say "OMG that's me!".

**Risen | NA-PvP | Alliance**
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
First team: Tues/Sun, 8pm CST ‚Äì 11pm
---
Second team: Wed/Mon, 7:30pm CST ‚Äì 10:30pm
---
**Loot System:**
---
Loot Council with Wishlist
---
**Introduction**:
---
Shard, founder and GM of Risen, has been playing WoW since February, 2005. In retail Vanilla he led one of the only 23 US guilds that were able to clear Naxx prior to TBC launch (Validus of Mal‚Äôganis). During TBC and WotLK he raided in &lt;vodka&gt;, one of the most prominent US raid guilds that has ever existed. For the past 3-4 years Risen has been based on a private server where we quickly took over as the top NA guild in raid progression for AQ40 and Naxx, and built a reputation for world pvp dominance. Perhaps you‚Äôve seen us in one of Pronker‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuff Watch‚Äù series of videos! If not, go check those out on youtube!
---
We have some pretty lofty goals for Risen in Classic! Not only do we want to be the dominant guild on our server but we also want to create the ultimate Classic community‚Äîa guild with 2-3 separate raid teams within it! Picture a guild where there‚Äôs always plenty of people online to do stuff with‚Äîthat‚Äôs what we want to build!
---
**What you can expect from us:**
---
‚Ä¢    High-end leadership with a long track record of success
---
‚Ä¢    The most well-organized guild you‚Äôll ever be part of‚Äîask any of our veteran members what they think
---
‚Ä¢    A fun, competitive atmosphere embracing the hardcore mentality without most of the silly no-lifer requirements
---
‚Ä¢    Dedication to server dominance in all aspects
---
‚Ä¢    2-3 raid teams within the guild, which means there will never be a shortage of activity!
---
**Currently recruiting:**
---
Team 1 High-performing healers, and one feral druid tank
---
Team 2 All classes except tanks
---
Check out www.risencc.com for more info about us!
---
Can't even get half way through the video without wanting the game so much more.  Classic really was/is such an amazing experience.  Super jealous of everyone that got into beta and very disappointed invites have basically stopped, but August 26 will get here soon enough and just thankful we have the opportunity to re-play this amazing game we all love
---
God Quinn‚Äôs so bad hope to Christ he‚Äôs not on my server if he even plays at all don‚Äôt think he can handle the vanilla experience üòÇüòÇ
---
Wait people actually are asking for a timer on wsg already? LOL
---
Strong in pvp. Raids often bring one for their shadow debuff but that's pretty much it.
---
No
---
Someone just watched punkrat‚Äôs latest video
---
Lmao the hunters are butthurt and classic hasn't even released yet
---
I needed on stuff from WC because I needed it for enchanting. I was a mage needing on everything. Sorry if that was you, I was just bad and new.
---
Hot damn I've always loved Shaman. Rolling one immediately and going for that two hand mace spec fuck yeah

---
c'mon guys those streamers have fun because they play with 100+ people. you will be alone when game released.
---
Strong in pvp is good enough for me ! How‚Äôs the leveling process with them you think?
---
Favorite druid, least favorite pally.
---
Unlike in 1.12, spell coefficients are public in the 1.13 client.  
---
Just look for your spell [here](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spelleffect.db2&amp;bc=3f61afa3a1f8955900f0c09c61a17bd4#search=&amp;page=1).  
---
Coefficient is the Field_1_13_2_30073_008 column.
---
Worst PvE DPS in the game. Makes the best use of Innervate of any DPS caster. Incredible in PvP.
---
Some people (guild warlocks) will argue thE shadow debuff is worth it, but a healer can apply that. Supposing you have enough warlocks to make it viable in the first place.
---
Because they want a successful playable launch without dead servers later and minimal queues early on.
---
They've talked about how the systems can only handle a certain number of people in a zone (and maybe larger?) due to spell triggers, abilities, etc going off all the time. This apparently isn't just a players per server hardware limitation, but also involves things like nearby players casting spells, mob population, etc.
---
Easy math time, pulling numbers out of my ass just to make the example.  
---
* Let's say a server can handle 1000 people until its population capped or sucks.  
---
* Expect 50,000 players to jump onto the game at launch; this includes people who want to play and will stick around, people who think they want to play and end up hating it, and people who just want to see what is is like. That makes 50 full servers.  
---
* Expect 25% of those players will stick around long term, and of those players, roughly 15-20% of them will be online at any given time due to work &amp; life schedules after the initial few launch weeks, etc. That means on average you now have 50 servers with about 180-250 players on them at any given time, which sucks. They feel empty.
---
Option 1: You then start merging servers to bring them back to 80% capacity, which introduces various problems (duplicate names, guild transfers, partial quest completion not transferring properly, etc, just like when you server transfer)
---
Option 2: Load balance on the fly. You use some sort of dynamic scaling (layering) to split each server into multiple copies of itself. Names and guild names are unique per server (instead of layer), it can automatically add and remove layers as needed to keep under 1000 players per layer, quest completion sticks around (because that is server based too), and over time as the population stabilizes, you consolidate it down to one layer per server at the intended population.
---
That's roughly how I understand it.
---
no
---
Except the servers can hold way more people now...
---
Layering means there are servers dedicated to merge after phase 1 is over and the population has likely halved on every server. This assures that everyone gets to play without impossible queues in the first weeks and everyone gets to have full servers after those weeks. It¬¥s perfect. The only other solution would have been separate subs to filter the tourists before they even arrive and we are long past that point.
---
Jesus... you're autistic.
---
There is nothing I wouldnt play for pay. But thr pay does matter. The most expensive would prob be aomething like $50 an hr and Id play anything.
---
NO CHANGES!!!
---
I‚Äôm not sure I follow. What do you mean? Are you just saying that the recreation won‚Äôt be as good as vanilla? Because if so, I would probably agree with that; they can‚Äôt FULLY recreate the experience but I am excited for them to do their best.
---
Monkeynews has a mechanical dragonling. You might be able to ask him if you catch his stream
---
Leveling is good just keep drinks on hand
---
I played one back in the day.  I enjoyed it.  Weren‚Äôt that many in my guild.  Got quite a lot of support and was brought to a few raids.   I wasn‚Äôt a hardcore raider by any means.
---
You can try and find someone and then get them into wow. It's a win win.
---
They (The streamers and a few people here) are at least trying to make it one.
---
I remember doing the same with that Night Elf boss and kiting her on my frost mage back in the day to org with some friends. The moonfire spam just 1 shots so many lowbies in the AH area, it's hilarious.
---
Forgot her name, but I know she was in TBC 100%, thus 99.9% sure she was there in classic so can't wait to do it again.
---
I see a lot of people don't like this zone but I have special feelings towards it since it was the first zone I ever encountered PvP against the other faction...this and Ashenvale. I have those memories from 13 years ago. I love it.
---
Mop was the best expansion from a PvP perspective
---
[removed]
---
At that point, do you even need to check its mouth?
---
Dev team stated it will only be in for 1-2 weeks depending on the turnout, so no worries man.
---
It's not a joke.  I am sick of these shit warriors showing up unprepared.   Getting to run a dungeon is a privilege for everyone except tanks, so there's no excuse for them to show up completely unprepared, and then waste an hour to two of people's time.
---
Horde runing the fun since the 1st war
---
I guess so, it's ok, it's not the end of the world you wanabee moderator.
---
Yikes wtf. That's the joy of WSG. What next, complaining that someone is camping them several times while leveling?
---
If you do all the quests in Elwynn. It takes you to Westfall. Which then takes you to Deadmines. So yes. It does *lead* you into Deadmines.
---
Why's that, if you don't mind me asking?
---
Really? I kinda thought using it in general was perma ban worthy. I mean, reading twitch chat looks like a bunch of people having seizures.
---
A typical chat:
---
PEPEGA
---
LULW
---
3HEAD
---
POG
---
HYPER CLAP
---
3HEADCLAP
---
 And any other retarded thing u can think of
---
Nah m8 that out of combat crit against a dude at 20% was a death sentence. Sometimes I would wait for them to leave combat and start eating to royally fuck them with that 100% crit and 50% damage. Guaranteed death.
---
Its still annoying
---
Strong in PVP? Yea, they freakin' melt faces....
---
Quinn is the man you &amp;$@!@$? Spergggggg!
---
They are extremely strong levelers. Probably second tier behind druids, locks, and hunters.
---
They can always open a new server and unload a layer there.
---
And im taking a shit. Whats your point?
---
I doubt that, I would have seen it before. Like I said the last post I saw was from 2 years ago. Wanabee moderator loser.
---
um i moused over the health bar in the clip to check how much health he has.
---
so there's that.
---
Oh man I can't wait for the week long AVs again
---
Whole $5?  WOW
---
It was 1.8 actually.
---
I can‚Äôt imagine that would go over well with the people in that layer; let  alone the community as a whole.
---
Not in vanilla, I think it was a 3.0 talent.
---
If talking world pvp phase 1/2 levelling. Obviously hunter and rogue are obnoxious af. However, ya spriest/Warlock do well in duels etc. although, the wonderful thing of Classic is that every class can offset pitfalls through predictive play, consumes and special items.
---
More important question is, is thai green curry worthy to eat?
---
You do if you are a self entitled shit dick.
---
Rogues are for pussy ass bitches that wont fight like a fucking man.
---
Yeah, I know, I was kinda doing it myself
---
I was in a guild that level alt to level 60 and only raided old content. That was before they introduced xp-lock. So you can imagine the moment when you hit level 61. Back to levelling another one:D that was some true classic shit
---
Jeez, you haven't truly done Warsong Gulch until you meta has shifted to where prot warriors are flag carriers, mages all respec for maximum burst to break through that and every flag capture is an hour long stand off.
---
This is actually legit
---
Not really. You can get a lesser and greater wand following Kargoz‚Äô guide pretty easily. A greater wand absolutely thrashes anything before the BFD wand. A lesser wand is usable until most of those lvl 15ish quests, and you can get it super quickly.
---
Well I've had plenty of 1.12 warlock experience too ! :\]
---
Like I said I didn't want to go too indepth here but, Voidwalker sac can be purged or denied depending on the tools used, some classes can straight up murder you sub 30 even with voidwalker.
---
Enh shaman for example just giggles at locks , purge VW sac,tremor/grounding and interrupts , and tbh he just needs 1 WF proc with a 2H to just global you ( that's if you're playing alliance).
---
BM hunters will destroy you mega hard , not to mention viper sting alone will force u to kill yourself or sit there until you die.
---
Warriors can shred you, all they have to do is fear your pet once your hit around 50% hp and you won't even be able to shield.
---
You really need to get around the 40s area to get some power spike in as a lock to get some leverage in , not to mention similar gear while leveling impacts classes differently , since a good lvl 30 weapon for a warrior is a substantial damage increase compared to a lvl 30 staff for lock basically being a bit more hp/mana and not affecting your damage at all.
---
You don't start getting good shadow damage gear until upper 30s and mid 40s , that's when you get to up your damage.
---
Not to mention voidwalker shield can be purged and prevented by CCing the VW , this includes grenades-  stuns /fears/banishes/silences.
---
I'm not saying you're utterly helpless as a lock, but let's say you need to put it more work than some classes at earlier levels when it comes to wpvp, this is by definition what it means to be below the powerspike.
---
I'd also like to mention that reliance on voidwalker in all situations and not utilizing more utility based pets for pvp at 60 is bit of a taboo subject that most lock veterans frown upon.
---
Don't get me wrong... it can make for some frustrating moments... but god damn it does make some pretty nuts BG's.
---
True, but these events are the ones we look back on fondly.
---
I really want to say that's working as intended. I remember something like this being the case just prior to BC.
---
I thought that the tombs in ZF were chests and proceeded to open them all and wiped my group.
---
4 other druids
---
I‚Äôll have to keep that in mind, kinda want to do one with my character in it lol.
---
You.... you okay buddy?
---
How long did it take for thottbot to come into the scene? I rememeber using it pretty early on.
---
Yes, but that's not my point. They both serve as a means of transportation through the medium of flight. They are both aircraft. At their most basic level, they serve the same purpose.
---
If u knew what was the point of the post?
---
Because Asmongold alone makes his stream fine to watch. When you add people talking over Asmongold the person I came to watch I can't enjoy the stream. When they were talking over Asmon they were literally shouting to talk. Also, they never have anything interesting to say.
---
lol cringe
---
look at the other guy who replied to you
---
When is "phase 2" tho? They can say "phase 2 is when we released Naxx" it's not OK. The extent and vagueness is murky. Minor sharding on starting zones would be not as bad, but they're going full blown sharding.
---
I've heard the argument that classic isn't hard, just time consuming.
---
For raiding, to an extent for sure. BFA mythic is mechanically very hard.
---
But the world itself is different. The world, lvling, is actually difficukt. You can die if you fuck up. That doesn't happen in BFA. It's a playground instead. Every difficult part of the game is in an instance.
---
If you need to drink often as a shadow priest you are doing it wrong.
---
Yes there is evidence all over the place if common sense isn't ones strong suit. But hey, it's easier for people to stick their heads in the sand and just downvote anything they don't agree with. You wouldn't want truth and facts to get in the way of emotions.
---
Longer link of this?
---
I had no idea if it was the case either. I figured I'd never heard about it as doing it at 60 would be kinda stupid. Turns out to be pretty hilarious when you're stuck at 30 though.
---
Added Dungeon Guide
---
Heal-tanking is an idea that's never entered my head. I guess with shocks on cooldown it might improve shaman tankability.
---
Reported. game of throne spoilers
---
retail is a containment game
---
Omg definitely
---
Yes!
---
He's not upset you dense fuck. Serious debate about the purpose of need. Need has always been you can ans will use it
---
Play FF14 ShadowBringers for to 2 months next month... But I don't know how I will survive for the next month with both hypes.
---
A few good shits and I'll be a newborn again.
---
everyone on this sub hates him, but there doesn't seem to be a legit reason for it, at least I haven't figured it out yet
---
They're done sending out invites to the beta. They have enough people. They don't need anymore, so your idea of adding more realms to let more people play the game is not based in reality.
---
Please go back to WoW retail General chat you weirdo.
---
I dont want you playing
---
This is the alex brigade aka one brain cell at a time.
---
Are there zone ratings?
---
I laughed way too hard at this
---
I‚Äôd prefer if they were available in the game, along with the armoured mounts. No limited availability, just permanent. That way they‚Äôre not so special, nobody is under pressure to get them as soon as possible, and people can just purchase whichever mount they actually want.
---
&gt; Worst PvE DPS in the game
---
Hey now, not in a world where retribution paladins exist.
---
How is MoP a good expansion? I checked out like maybe a few weeks into Cata, and as soon as I saw Kung-fu Pandas, I knew I was right to quit playing.
---
It just looked so unbelievable stupid, and no longer resembled the game I used to play
---
Oh okay, that would make sense considering I started in WOTLK
---
That might be the auto-attack that finished off the priest shield I had. He was hitting for 30-60 most of the time.
---
Welcome home preacher. Welcome home.
---
I always question when I see low level alliance here, like you have better questing areas why are you here??
---
I‚Äôm Horde and even I don‚Äôt want to be in Stonehell.
---
Next time only list one or two at a time to create a further sense of limited supply.
---
Found the Beast mastery hunter or warlock.
---
This is a great learning experience for those new to classic
---
Asmondgold's mom seem cool. She should stream.
---
Wooa come on. Nobody who is austistic is that silly. Hes all on his own.
---
There was a hotfix at some point to make A'dal not engage in combat. I can't really remember what the context was, but it was indeed because people kited stuff to him. I think he didn't actually hit very hard so he was prone to actually dying from this. Not really any more problematic than various other NPC's dying though, so it's a bit odd they changed him specifically. I think they just didn't want him to die because Naaru are akin to deities (also their whole lifecycle and stuff).
---
Wouldn't hesitate.
---
&gt; Incredible in PvP.
---
That's a bit of a stretch. They have an attrition/drain style that's very strong in duelling (like SL locks) but not great in BGs or group pvp.
---
I actually find them to be one of the fastest leveling classes. I‚Äôm going holy/disc at 60, but I‚Äôm gonna level shadow/disc.
---
My wife probably can't wait for classic to come out, because she hates seeing me just stare at my PC screen for 2 hours and then go to bed when I used to be a pretty hardcore gamer. She isn't a gamer though
---
You clearly mean Esfand, Asmongold is a tool. Asmongold is a lot like Donald Trump except Donald is strangely a lot smarter.
---
check out classic twinking discord in wow wiki i believe
---
I used Ironfoe on my combat rogue in Highmaul in WoD. I got a #1 DPS parse on Tectus IIRC, and Ironfoe/Thrash Blade were nerfed the next week to just proc a static damage hit instead of a melee swing. It had some weird interaction with Main Gauche that caused it to proc like crazy and the procs hit really hard. Fun times.
---
Well, I guess and needed a bit more than my own commitment. It wasn't really a formal "cry for vanilla" since we didn't really proclaim anything. It was just fun in the face of inevitable progress..
---
Make stupid statements and u get treated like you‚Äôre stupid my dude
---
Honestly the best thing to do would get the first 10 levels in their starting zones, which takes maybe a few hours, then meet up in westfall. Then you can get figuratively geared up for deadlines.
---
It won't be for everyone, not every game is for everyone. Those people will quit, and Blizzard is expecting that. Its partially why layering is a thing for Phase 1
---
Honestly, I love all of them. Hybrids are fun! It's nice being able to occasionally switch roles to help out the group, or even yourself if you're out soloing. It keeps things from getting too monotonous. (Note: I am not a hardcore raider.)
---
Quick question though. Priest? If they're hybrids, shouldn't warriors be hybrids, too? They can both take on two roles.
---
I love Shaman, which you could probably tell by my flair. And I think pally is probably the most tedious class in the game
---
No, I got down voted for speaking the truth!
---
It *is* iconic, it's not a joke!
---
Finding Mankirk's Wife is the quintessential Vanilla experience. You were given no help, no direction, no quest objective marker, no gear requirements, no minimum item level. Just an adventurer and a dream of righting this man's broken life. Where's the joke in that?
---
Magic Dust
---
Really Sticky Glue
---
What bug?
---
new map for Axis and Allies
---
"Dartol's Rod of Transformation" that transforms you into a Furbolg.
---
I agree, I don‚Äôt even want to play classic anymore. All these people will have such a huge advantage over regular players. It‚Äôs not even like the beta was 7 days but fucking months. I also hate this streamer, what ever his name is (assgold or something) Dude, complains non fucking stop.
---
Oh the irony. You're clearly the asshole in this scenario
---
Hes just got the warmest friendliest vibe, havent watched him in years guess it's time to amend that!
---
Well it has been something blizzard has always hated so I‚Äôm not surprised they fixed it so that it won‚Äôt happen.
---
I‚Äôm so tired of people complaining about layering... I don‚Äôt know if they can‚Äôt read or have poor reading comprehension but blizzard has already said it‚Äôs just to get people through startup.
---
&gt; 30-60
---
That's low as fuck even if you're wearing mail. I hate this soy classic server
---
Unrealistic af.  Auto-pilot isn't engaged and you're playing a paladin.
---
Why do people like the OP in that thread even have an interest in Classic?   
---
Please tell me he's trolling...
---
Need help!
---
LOL you are free to quit vanilla once naxx ends dude, just like every psrvr has demonstrated
---
I wouldn't count Priest as a Hybrid class.  I've never heard anyone refer to Priest as a Hybrid class. Everyone has at least three things to be a hybrid class. 
---
Druids: DPS, Tanking, Healing
---
Shaman: DPS, Ranged DPS, Healing
---
Paladin: DPS, Tanking, Healing.
---
Priest just do damage and healing, but every class needs to be able to damage to level. If you're going to consider Priest a hybrid class, you'd have to consider Warrior a hybrid class because they can DPS and tank. But like I said, every class needs to be able to DPS to level.
---
To answer your question though. My favorite is Druid, my least favorite is Paladin. Paladin is boring, mostly just auto-attacks.
---
what the...
---
A god has many faces.
---
I don't think there is a class that humans excel at over other race options for Pvp.
---
Night Elf would be Hunter or Druid.
---
Dwarf: Hunter, Rogue
---
For alliance, my picks would be:
---
* Druid - Nelf (only option)
---
* Hunter - Dwarf or Nelf (SF is great so is Shadowmeld)
---
* Paladin - Dwarf (SF &gt; Perception imo)
---
* Priest - Dwarf (FW is just too good and you get SF)
---
* Mage - Gnome (EA &amp; 5% int &gt; perception)
---
* Rogue - Gnome or Dwarf (situational, SF vanish is nice)
---
* Warlock - Gnome (EA &amp; 5% int &gt; perception) 
---
* Warrior - Gnome (EA can be a lifesaver)
---
thanks carlos
---
I didn't know Airforceproud95 was a Classic supporter!
---
Warrior 5-6days exactly what the boosters said :)
---
That was a *reel*y good joke.
---
Skull of Impending Doom, Carrot on a Stick
---
no shit, but its funny everyone thinks i actually do this lol. played a hunter all thru vanilla and never had this happen.
---
My point, yes
---
Like in the Weak spec for pvp is Arms, Fury Warrior &amp; Combat Rogue, all lower than the balance druid which is in good??????  
---
Are they just trolling or is the standards of articles these days?
---
I'd be willing to bet my left nut that he despawned because it got pulled away from both raids and the few people with aggro died.
---
You should be on a private server practicing raids and pvp like my guild does every Friday, Saturday &amp; Sunday.
---
RemindMe! 4 Months
---
Yes, I noticed that website being full of errors and false info as well.
---
Someone kind of brought it up: dps uptime and timing your CDs right can lead to better dps. Don‚Äôt stand in things, if you are dead, you don‚Äôt do damage. Decurse, because if the raid wipes you don‚Äôt do damage either. Same goes for sheep. 
---
Regarding cds: most mages will be arcane/frost while one will be deeper in frost to stack a debuff. You want to use your CDs together and early so you might be able to reuse them. Don‚Äôt use them too early, before the tank has enough threat and before the boss has the important rebuffs that multiply the extra damage you do thanks to your CDs. If the fight is long enough will depend on the boss and your raid.
---
Also, don‚Äôt afk the trash mobs. Show dedication, show up on time with consumables and water/food and repaired gear. Don‚Äôt be the person holding everyone else up
---
So from could we look at various leveling zones and also account for quest numbers to get a crude idea for the 1-60? (I guess there‚Äôs already leveling guides but oh well)
---
I‚Äôm hoping to get my warrior to 60 in 2 weeks.
---
We don‚Äôt know.
---
IDK what you are seeing but arms warrior is in the top tier for pvp on this site, only prot warrior is in the bottom tier

---
No one knows. The developers have talked about doing more content if it's popular, but be one knows if that means tbc or all new vanilla content. I'd much prefer the latter.
---
Oooh Laphroig, a man of taste

I'm not exaggerating my preference.

That one was a bit fishy...
---
Yeah then ur either extremely lucky, or don't read Reddit much. It's almost on every classic post on WoW.
---
The bit at 11mins is EXACTLY what happens to me in classic wow
---
This guy literally made me not want to play wow. So much complaining in such little time.
---
This was always the case. I recall using these on a paladin in the original wow open beta. Since i was nigh immortal, i could solo crossroads guards with a baited up pole and high fishing skill at level 23.
---
Classic Twinking Discord invite here:

---
Engineering had grenades that stun.
---
I always loved messing around in major cities with these unique shapeshifts. Good find!
---
Sorry I ment pve not PvP
---
Discombobulator ray, Skull of Impending Doom, engi boots, nifty stopwatch
---
I'd go further and say almost every class has the EXACT SAME amount of CDs, the same stun times, near same damage, same EVERYTHING. They even gave DPS classes all some sort of heal to be even with the hybrids. It's absolute shit compared to classic.
---
Yeah let's judge people for wanting to play the most anticipated game of the year earlier.
---
I am planning to wait these 3 months
---
I do vaguely remember something like this before Blizzard changed it.
---
Jesus christ it's asmogold..
---
Having to go to the charred vale to kill those chimeras fir the warrior class quest at level 20-30 was truly an experience as a human...
---
My good friend plays league and his girlfriend is always in discord and league. I dont think I could have a girlfriend be in my holy land that is WoW. Video games are my sacred place
---
they're all just healers in pve past a certain point (that point being the first raid tier).  The caster dps specs of the hybrids are a nightmare to play because you will run out of mana in 2 minutes.  People throw around "literally unplayable" a lot, but vanilla balance druids were \*literally unplayable\* in raids.
---
They both should be considered hybrids.
---
Lol that sounds depressing :(
---
Ret actually can dps. They bring unique buffs as well. It's the shamans that are useless dps.
---
The part where he talked about getting whispers or talking to people the next day or next week that you previously grouped with for a quest, happened to be and everybody else too. Go away, troll.
---
I mean, no. They're pretty average.
---
Serious question - does leeway =lag?
---
Are you playing 80 hours a week because in classic unless you do that it's not possible. Joana has a warrior 60 time of like 6 days played time
---
\&gt;  Meanwhile horde gets a large protected settlement in the middle of the map with roads leading to every section quickly. 
---
Which gets camped constantly by 60's. The guards are so low level they don't even aggro max level players, making it essentially unguarded.
---
For honor.
---
It's so hard not to say "told you so". I guess I'm just jaded now.
---
Yeah funny. So not only are you an asshole, but you also lie for attention?
---
It is entertaining to roll through as Horde and wipe out the low-levels for the hell you take in Stonetalon.
---
Going through a bottle of that right now myself. So good!
---
goblin rocket helm
---
&gt;  Blizzard isn't new to massive launches. Why are you saying Blizzard is underestimating anything at all?
---
BFA launch could not handle the server traffic, and WoW broke for at least a week.
---
WoD Launch could not handle the server traffic, and WoW broke for 2 weeks.
---
MoP Launch could not handle the server traffic, and WoW broke for a few days.
---
It's not uncommon for Blizzard to be unprepared for the server load created by the number of players for WoW at launch. It's why the stress tests they've been running lately are such a good sign, but even then they could end up unprepared.
---
I want with all my heart and soul for this to be true and instead of the Guribashi Arena tournament becoming a bloodbath people just head straight on to the Stranglethorn fishing extravaganza.
---
I guess... But there are a few combos that you can say are overall better than othets. Orc &gt; Troll Warrior for example.
---
if you want to pvp yes
---
if you want to pve no (you asking this question means you probably won't get in a guild that will let you play it in raids)
---
I won‚Äôt be working or will be working 1-2 days a week. I played during vanilla. First I made a rogue and then much much later made a warlock. Warlock was significantly faster seeing as how I knew the game better at that point. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be able to crush my way to 60. Also playing with friends and able to run dungeons without looking for groups.
---
Yup, :( can't remember the last game I actually enjoyed where I would lose sleep for work
---
What if the other player has high ping as well?
---
warlock and rogue
---
Don't feed trolls
---
Actually this precise issue is what caused me to stop raiding in Legion, now I just have to find a semi-casual raid guild with a Saturday-Sunday raid schedule or raids 11pm+ EST Weekdays.             
---
          
---
That alternating days shit is for the fucking birds, after a month I was basically told to go PUG because I was unreliable.
---
nah, i lied to make a point not to generalize every hunter as a bad one just because a few people had bad experiences
---
Honestly I think the die hard Nochange crowd would freak if any bugs that we're initially in Vanilla were removed.
---
damn that was funny lol bros ofc ofc
---
Isn't she just down the way under a bridge? If memory serves me right.
---
But, I agree it's an iconic quest. The constant bombardment is "Where's Mankirks wife?" (Yes spelled wrong) and the hilarious answers that followed, to the Chuck Norris jokes after what made Barrens chat, Barrens' chat.
---
Well said. The only thing I like about retail is the raids. BoD one of the best raids they‚Äôve ever released, stuck in one of the worst expansions they‚Äôve ever released.
---
With modern theroycrafting theres not really any specs that are totally trash.  Feral druids being an example.  If youre willing to blow your life savings on consumables almost anything is atleast viable.
---
As Trivi said, it‚Äôs sixteen.
---
The devs actually said it use to exist due to capability of the servers, however, to keep it as natural to classic as possible, they will be keeping that limit, even though it really is no longer a limit. 
---
They don‚Äôt want to accidentally cause classes to change in balance from vanilla all the sudden Incase their dots made them a lot better.
---
Sadly, it means certain specs will remain unviable.  Some people don‚Äôt like that, some do. But at the end of the day, if we want ‚Äúreal‚Äù classic back, then it is something that existed so.
---
It‚Äôs definitely one I‚Äôm gonna have to suck up, I really hate that limit.
---
Corpse runs are awful and everyone is forced down one narrow central path, which makes ganking common. If you're Horde and die at the peak (and yes, some level 40 will kill you there), it's like a 15 minute run.
---
‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt you just let my kited mob wipe you and your whole group like I wanted to?‚Äù 
---
Lol, so funny watching the defeated streamers and their fans cry about it live... guess you‚Äôre bringing it here.
---
TipsOut "lost" his job and cried to community begging for money.
---
Someone commented "lmao" on a TipsOut meme video, TipsOut proceeded to call the police.
---
Streamed on Twitch claiming he had "leaks" when in reality he had nothing but a cynical trick he knew would work to get him viewers. At this point, the community here really turned on him and started seeing him for what he is.
---
He's inexperienced at the game, which is fine, but he claims that he is good at the game and makes half-assed shitty guides that inexperienced players eat up. 
---
He got rekt by a boss because he's stupid, he proceeded to report the boss as bugged.
---
Claims to be "one of the best, if not the best" dueler in North America, no kappa, no troll, and then proceeds to get fucking shit on. We then get a  laundry list of excuses that wouldn't have changed the outcome anyway, because surprise, TipsOut is actually terrible at the game.
---
Quest items will disappear and require a few minutes to respawn. Starter zones will be a peach during launch!
---
They arent totally bad in pve.  You wont be competing with mages/warriors but honestly with 40 raid spots you can do everything up to late AQ40 with like 20 people that are actually doing anything.
---
[Huh](http://gph.is/1ILjfVc)
---
It's not retail where you gotta choose to go Shadow or Holy. If you're Shadow spec, you have all the same spells as Holy except Holy Nova, Spirit of Redemption, and Lightwell.
---
It's rather do-able to heal dungeons as a dps spec while you're leveling up. Then Respec to heals after you hit 60
---
That's what I feared lol
---
Locks, hunters, and druids are the best levelers. They are all pretty decent in pve, with warlocks scaling the best. Druids are decent healers, tanks or off tanks if raiding, and ok dps. Hunters are good in pvp and every raid needs at least 3. Their dps doesn't scale as well as other dps classes.
---
Love it.
---
This is working as intended imo.
---
They disappear and respawn. Also note that escort quests; once someone takes the quest the npc becomes unavailable during that time and shortly after.
---
100% 2004 WoW. This isn't remotely going to be the same experience, but it'll be more enjoyable than retail at least. Nobody knew wtf they were doing, there was no min maxing, everyone played the class that looked coolest to them, not did the most DPS. Christ, we even have most people picking racials based on min/max. Back then that seriously wasn't a thing, even by hardcore gamers for the most part.
---
It was more social, a lot less toxic than gaming is now. Less guides, so chances are if you PvPed someone, you both didn't know shit about your class. Now, nearly everyone has the most optimal spec and a written guide how to play it.
---
Twinking was very diverse, and not too common. Now, there's step by step guides how to go about everything, and there will be a ton of twinks. 
---
There will be far less hybrids in PvP and just in general. Other classes perform better, and 2019 is all about optimal optimal optimal. Also doesn't help that the servers will be stagnant, so w.e is OP now is going to be OP indefinitely. Easy decisions.
---
But it should be fun either way
---
No serious raiders will bring one until the debuff cap is raised to 16 though. Unless people start stomping raid content quickly.
---
Water boy would like it more. I call Bobby up now.
---
Imagine if they cancel retail, and make a new expansion after classic, starting right from there, giving up on Wod, abandoning terrible additions, and just making new lore from there
---
I think it was TBC.  there was a raid drop spellpower weapon hunters could dual wield to gain tons of spellpower since it was not unique and not a main hand
---
add them and make them limited like they were
---
i get the feeling a lot of people that don't want them in are the same people that wouldn't be able to get them anyway lol
---
Ah gotcha, makes sense.
---
Free drinks for Friends and Foes alike.
---
Good to see him back!
---
It's dumbf*&amp;#$ that can't get their acronyms straight. DM has always been Dire Maul, VC has always been deadmines, since the beginning days of WoW. Nobody knows what anybody is talking about since re7ards use DM for deadmines.
---
üôÇ
---
1 week and classic has so little content that asmon has to just explore. 
---
actual classic isnt gonna be much better. dead after 2 months of phase 6
---
Hey, that's *our* batshit.
---
I told myself I wouldnt do a pvp server again but fuck I don't want to miss out on some of the insanity
---
 Fury warrior ranked under balance druid 
---
OMEGALUL worst dps above best dps
---
nope I played boomie in MoP
---
I did the same thing. I named my character Deigo (I always tried to go with 'real' names) and it wasn't until I was in my first Ony run that someone said my name in Vent for some reason. 
---
They said "Day-go".
---
I laughed and said something along the lines of, "it's pronounced Dee-ay-go" and they said, "oh, well you spelled it wrong". 60 levels. Weeks /played. No idea.
---
You‚Äôre high if you think this is ping related
---
which means its good it was tested and now they can fix it
---
Hey guys, Hobbs here....
---
16 from the start.
---
Maybe I'm giving to much credit, but pretty sure you guys just got hella whooshed
---
All of that pretty much points to mages. They‚Äôre the best AoE farmers, they‚Äôre easy to level and have better dps than most other classes. Other classes that can make gold easily while filling those roles would be warlock and hunter (though hunters are pretty average in PvE, they can solo content for decent gold). I‚Äôd avoid rogues, paladins, warriors, shamans and priests if you want all of that together in one class. Priests and warriors can level together though and do very well, and they can also 2-man some dungeons for gold, but that requires two people to want to do that at the same time so.
---
If something this trivial makes you not want to play classic anymore then you never wanted to in the first place
---
üëç
---
Agreed, that's part of the joy in a fucked up way, or even part of the charm
---
i make $36/hr
---
This is 100% bait. That is literally retain and the people getting mad in here are idiots.
---
At some point when I was a druid, Nat pagle's extreme angler whatever the Epic fishing pole is kept me going for a long time.
---
This is not ping related
---
Fuckin relax pal
---
No. Not it doesn‚Äôt
---
I get wanting to play, but paying for access to a beta that in the long run doesn't matter?
---
4D chess right there.
---
How are they different?
---
No it‚Äôs not
---
Meanwhile when they run into one of the patrolling npc, he charges at the dragon, if you look earlier in the stream, you see the guards attacking the dragon.
---
Gorduk Ogre Suit
---
Ok.
---
This isn't private servers, things like the pickup items in gnome dwarf starter zone have like a 10second respawn on beta
---
They're not actually that long of respawns on beta fyi
---
Does anybody know if I will be able to use Bartender 4 addon for classic? I just started using it not long ago and have fallen in love with it over the stock bars.
---
broke your comment chain get owned
---
That's some good news! I feel like I'm gonna be stuck in Shadowglen for 5 hours
---
Boooo
---
Oh boy
---
Preach is more of wow youtuber than streamer, more known for his videos than streams. Check your facts before blindly hating maybe ?
---
I already paid $15 for a shot at it :P
---
Haven‚Äôt logged into BFA once. I just want Classic.
---
&gt;Loose gaggle formation.
---
Best answer
---
Yeah, definitely the best for leveling. Lock is a solid option. I've heard a lot of people say that druids aren't "viable" in raiding though. Hunter is good, but I'm thinking that everyone is going to flock to that class in droves. Idk, maybe I'm wrong
---
He didn‚Äôt do it because he‚Äôs self entitled. It was a mistake; he thought Hunter‚Äôs could use maces
---
I've had upwards of ~200+ ms on pservers and never seen it that bad.
---
Priest feels so clean to play, you have an answer for everything.  And at the end of the day, controlling someones mind and making them jump off a fucking cliff is just the coolest thing in the entire game.  I‚Äôm going rogue for the cutting edge pvp playstyle though.
---
This was especially great for low-level BGs. 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49 were all a lot of fun. So much twinking, engineering items, and high end enchants. It was ruined by heirlooms + RDF rewards basically ensuring you were almost always at the best ilvl for your level (or close). 
---
No one gave a shit about 50-59 really lol.
---
16 was at 1.7...did a blue say they're changing it?
---
leeway is the "bonus" melee range a player gets when pursing a target, otherwise you'd have to be in front of your target you're chasing for the server to recognize you're in range from what you're client is telling you.
---
Player lag from being in EU (i.e. where is actually is server side is probably 3-5 yards behind where his client is showing him) combined with the rogue having most likely very low ping makes the leeway do this.
---
Now, while the leeway may be too lenient, this is working as intended.
---
The only achievements in WoW are server/region/world first PvE kills and reaching Gladiator/Rank 1. Anything else in the game is pitifully easy.
---
This is vanilla-like isn't it?
---
Druid are arguably the best off tanks, but raids only need 1 or 2. Resto is also definitely viable. More druids mean more innervates and battle resses. Feral dps is middling but not as bad as classes like shamans or oomkin.
---
Yeah I'm definitely leaning towards mage. They're a really solid class. Also, I thought rogues were good gold grinders because of that pickpocket ability
---
Yeah, I feel like you have a much more positive opinion of people than I do, because I'm taking that comment at face value.
---
Yeah with that schedule you can definitely make it happen.
---
Should have just posted some stupid clip of Asmon like everyone else
---
BFA is being able to steamroll mobs till around 116 where scaling starts to fuck your ass.
---
Vanilla is hoping to god you get a crit or your spell isn't resisted so you kill the mob instead of dying, at level 2.
---
True but rogues are one of the overpopulated classes. You‚Äôll have a lot of competition
---
Paying for business class on a flight doesn't matter in the long run either. People still buy all those seats.
---
Hm, in my guild this was the "airplane set" seing how the shoulders were basically airplan wings with the blinking lights and shit.
---
Night Elf boss? Night Elves only had two (three?) bosses--Tyrande, Fandral (or something), and Shandris. I have to assume you mean Tyrande?
---
Retail matters?
---
&lt;One Percent Wipe&gt; Oceanic PvP Horde Semi-Hardcore 
---
OVERVIEW 
---
One Percent is a guild for people who love WoW, are serious about raiding without forgetting to have fun playing. We have a wide variety of members from 15 year veterans to brand new players. This is a guild for those for are looking to smash through content and have a laugh doing it. Were not going to be waking up at 2:00am to compete for server first, but we will be committing to never miss a weeks worth of boss loot due to slow progression or have to skip doing certain raids because of slow farm clears. Raiding is our focus but WoW to us isn't all about the raids, it‚Äôs about making a community where people feel welcome to hangout, find some friends and get the best gear available to crush the alliance! 
---
Raid times - On release will be Wed / Sun 6:30pm - 10:30 AEST (GMT+10) 
---
Requirements - Everyone puts in effort to prepare properly for raids with correct gear/consumables/specs.
---
Loot -We are a BiS priority DKP raid guild, for info on loot check our guild policies link on discord. 
---
Currently Recruiting all classes, and some class leader positions available.

For emphasis
---
&gt;"Not Easy to Deal High DPS as Paladin"
---
Ah, yeah you're right. Thanks for your input
---
MOP introduced pandas , who literally killed wow
---
Not to mention the level of add ons we‚Äôll have. If they have something to direct you towards quest objectives... ez pz.
---
You'd think so. But if news gets around about what you do, people all over the server know.
---
It's best just to do it rather than be on the blacklist to join a pug dungeon run by the whole server.
---
Yea, you kinda seem like a loser for making this and then willingly sharing it with people for attention
---
Hey I remember you, you miserable individual you.
---
You're the guy who followed me for 8 posts after I called you out on being a goof.
---
As a kid and first time MMO player in vanilla, whenever I opened the map and clicked on different zones I thought that the zones with the more mountains meant the zone was more dangerous and high level
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I avoided going to stonetalon for the longest time because when I click it on the map, obviously the entire map is basically mountains.  so I was scared to go there lol.
---
Are you confusing him for mean Swifty? Tipsout was not the best Vanilla Warrior. I don‚Äôt even remember him playing classic or ever saying he did play originally in 2004-2006
---
Clearly the vast majority hated those changes because the game went from 10 million subs to "we're no longer reporting them lol"
---
So it's not just Illidan. I bought sub time like a pleb hoping to get into the beta and I figured since I played for it, I may as well explore and see what's changed since Wrath. When I finally got to Org all I saw was what I assume was gold spam in Chinese characters, guilds selling runs, and the occasional person selling a mount or something.
---
I‚Äôm in the minority in this post apparently - id happily pay for it. I‚Äôd still report bugs and actually hunt for them as well. For me it‚Äôs an equation of ‚Äúhow much entertainment will I get out of this money?‚Äù And for me, the beta would be a lot. In terms of dollars, if I could have beta access tonight through release I‚Äôd pretty happily pay around 150-200. Shame on me, I suppose üòÑ
---
Depends who they are going against and what the situation is. You can't reasonably make such a blanket statement. It's like saying Priests are trash because Rogues counter them.
---
C'mon man, just let people enjoy things.
---
Eh.  Thanks, but no thanks.
---
I'll spend my 3 months watching WoW porn.
---
Windshear Crag used to be brutal... Anyone remember going up through all that scaffolding way up above the lake? Bloody Goblins...
---
Yes if you think you'll be 60 within 2 weeks - good luck:)
---
Are you 12? Who gives a shit what he looks like.
---
Warlock u have to farm soul shards, just to warn u
---
Lol all 3 rogue specs are bad for pve. Ecksdee
---
which one introduced the auction house you can buy Stratholme mount at
---
I'm glad the damage scales this way
---
Just cut out a ball notch in the seat and go naked
---
I can't remember exactly what it is.  But as part of the dungeon two quest chain, there was something you used to summon extra bosses.   Some of these bosses had seperate loot tables with items you can only get from them.
---
I use to sell runs to druids that wanted the idol from the druid boss in brd.
---
Yes, it is. In vanilla, PVP bosses were capable of engaging in PVE. It's only in modern wow that this was disabled.
---
God I should hope not
---
His ping is probably lower though.  From US to servers in france (where most pservers are located), I was normally at 80ms.. 90ms at some high times.
---
Funny thing.. I just subbed hoping to get into the beta.. jumped on retail.. mind you, it's all cloud based now - servers all over the country.. and my ping is 70ms to a local server..  that's almost the same as a connection to france using the 1.12 client.  WTF?
---
I also noticed, everything in retail has a 1 second lag to it.  Looting something, talking in any channel.. everything, 1 second delay.  The client and this cloud based stuff is shit.
---
no one runs all of dire maul, itd be DM:E or something like that
---
They won't be as overpopulated as mages. Right now, it looks like warriors and, if horde, shamans will be the most populated, followed by mages. Rogues are below those.
---
We can't be really have enough warriors in any case. They are the best tanks and dps. Guilds often bring upwards of ten or more to a raid.
---
They don't have a choice but to get rid of layering before phase 2. It simply cannot be allowed to exist at the same time as world bosses. It would be so toxic to the gameplay experience it's difficult to fathom.
---
Classic starts at 1.12. Blizzard has said the game will start w/ 16 debuff slots.
---
Imagine being affected this much by someone you can choose not to interact with
---
Yes, but chasing, the other player should be 100ms behind the other.. he cannot be ahead of his own movements...
---
Hunter
---
Wat
---
woah steady on tiger
---
BM Hunter. It is so imbalance
---
Can I just say, what the hell is going on there with the case?
---
nice try mom
---
As weird as it sounds, I can't wait for the adventure RP elements. Having to eat food, First Aid having a real purpose. Not being a literal god that can wipe out entire armies in a half cocked *"I'm only swinging at 5% of my power hahaha"* anime character.
---
Idk, makes sense if - like me - all you want to play is Vanilla, even if your progress gets erased in 2 months

Eeeeh I‚Äôve always seen more rogues than mages. I agree about shamans but they‚Äôre too good not to have in raids
---
I don't care what anyone says.. I'm US and played on a ton of vanilla and tbc servers... even when playing with aussies.. never seen anything like that.  
---
I can tell you, playing retail as of the beta, and this client is shit.  There is a 1 second lag to all actions and even chat.

I would love to be helping you test. WTB beta. :(

There was some server that tried to kill A'dal by kiting Fel Reaver to Shattrath. I *think* they succeeded, but it's been a long time. I remember seeing a screenshot of A'dal at low HP, at least.
---
My friend levels prot or healspecced, he is the definition of a masochist though.
---
Lock out
---
Do you need help?
---
Resto at least, though not as good as priests. Enhance is a lol spec and ele is a pvp spec.
---
Last time I did it was for Bloodborne. Originally though back when I was raiding Molten Core, man I lost DAYS of sleep on that shit.

Another one to bring to the arena was tidal charm or the Rez trinket
---
"If your first character is not a hunter or mage you are just fucking around"
---
I wouldn‚Äôt stress it man. People who want classic are gonna love and play classic regardless. I think the only people complaining are the ones actively looking for reasons to hate classic (mostly salty retail players I would assume)
---
Imagine if Esfand and MadSeason were brothers, Hobbs would be the dad that raised them. Just a happy, kind, good dude. He was famous for doing "the Hobbs way of pulling." He's the OG farmer and powerleveler. He'd bring lowbies into SM dungeons and pull basically the whole dungeon into one big mob pack and melt them down. He is the proof-of-concept for massive pulls and showed that paladins with certain talents and gear can essentially live forever. Absolute legend in the true sense of the word.
---
He transitioned over to hearthstone and other games I'm not interested in a while back so I stopped following him, but if he starts doing WoW again in earnest I will 100% be back!
---
dungeon set 2 summon.
---
I'll never understand why anyone would want to play Feral DPS, Rogue is far more enjoyable anyway and far superior.
---
Nope theres a clip of him talking about how he's one of the best and ask anyone from back in the day and they'll say the same...when he got called out he backed off the claim
---
Oh cool

Yep. Just make sure you stack up on Mana pots.
---
Man I remember Preach being so negative towards
---
the idea of bringing back classic WoW.
---
times.change.
---
Oh yeah, I'd play from the time I came home from school til bed time. In the 15 years since, I haven't met many online friends. During WoW, I met many life-long friends. Very different game.
---
A god should be all knowing, Asmongold is certainly not all knowing all he would not spend two days trying to get to hyjal without knowing it‚Äôs impossible to do it as a warrior.
---
Me? I'mma bad bitch.
---
I play priest.
---
Yeah, looks pretty accurate to me sadly. This is exactly why I never played a melee class seriously, it was just too bullshit fighting with the netcode. Having ping under 200ms was something you boasted about in guild chat.
---
Only death can pay for life.
---
Hoes mad
---
Thanks for this man. I have baron rivendare facing the four horsemen. My screen saver is paladin tier 2 (idk if thats you) itd be sweet if the paladin was animated too
---
I watched the video. He didnt even look at it. Confirmed shit dick.
---
rip
---
Is that you DemoD?
---
Can you elaborate?
---
Didn't say that. Paying for access to a beta in which progress will be wiped at launch is what i meant.
---
will multishot actually break cc when there are other non-cc'ed targets available?  I know they put dumb-downs in late tbc? to keep multi-target ranged abilities (avenging shield, multi-shot) from breaking cc'ed mobs.
---
We haven't had a good set in basically 13 years :(
---
nice man! i hope you enjoy the game! üôÇ
---
Hooray, she wasn't the one!
---
From watching Soniis stream. The orc that Teremus was aggroed on jumped off a bridge and that made Teremua bug out and despawn. 
---
Which is what the Horde wanted.
---
/r/MGTOW
---
I like the idea of straddling raid lockout timers in order to raid every other week during phase one.
---
Couple questions:
---
1.  I thought raids reset Tuesday at 3am EST.  Am I misremembering?
---
2.  When you increase your raid schedule after phase one, will raid days remain tuesday/wed, or will you expand to 3+ days/week?
---
There's also that night elf in undercity, Sylvanas.
---
I literally came here for that
---
Fuck off with that shit hole
---
I figure this is bait, but what kind of advantage will they have when classic releases? They'll have experience getting to 30 and running 30 content which means approximately fuckall in the long run.
---
Imagine inflation L O L

CLASSIC RUINED BECAUSE OF THOSE STUPID STREAMERS BabyRage

Shamans could still 1 shot people in the early days of tbc using a 2h weapon, so yes, that will be a thing all throughout classic.

**&lt;No Offense&gt; Alliance | NA-PVE | Late-Night Raiding Guild**
---
* No Offense is a group of old school raiders that just want an enjoyable gaming experience. We are currently running Heroic Raids and obtain AOTC on every content tier in retail, and we plan to do the equivalent in Classic WoW.
---
**Late-Night Pacific Time (PST PDT PT):**
---
* The guild tends to log on after the kids go to bed and log off around midnight.
---
**PvE:**
---
* Because we have kids and jobs and we enjoy raiding, not corpse camping streamers and being called terrible names by kids younger than our children.
---
**Alliance:**
---
* We currently raid as Horde.  So we're mixing it up!  Plus - Paladins!
---
**What we are looking for in members:**
---
* Mature players interested in raiding and playing to support end game content.
---
* Social members that want to hang out and have fun playing later into the evening with a friendly group.
---
* It would be great to get several farm groups going, so even if you just want to goof off and get carried by the main raid team through BWL while we're farming our 12th Ashkandi for a hunter... come on by!
---
* We will also be pushing AoTC and Mythic+10 content Horde side on retail WoW, so that option will also be available.
---
* Anyone that is also looking to participate in both retail and classic, this will be a great fit for you (though it's certainly not required).
---
**General Gaming Schedule:**
---
* 8:30 - 11:30 PT Weeknights and Weekends
---
**Raid Scheduled:**
---
* TBD, though our current Retail raid schedule is Wednesday/Thursday

You seem hip. What is lulw, omegalul, pog, etc?
---
You forgot Diablo 3.
---
The closer we get the more I'm thinking I will take a week off work and not sleep for 3 days after launch
---
Bro, I‚Äôm sorry, it just seemed really, really apt based on what you posted.
---
I'm not trust me, they're twitch emotes
---
Back in classic on my dwarf hunter my buddy who was also a hunter and I would hike up above SunRock and use Eagle Eye to scout horde landing and leaving, then we‚Äôd go and ambush them. I had a ton of fun and lots of memories in this zone.
---
Then you‚Äôre blind. He looked at the item at the 7 second mark.
---
Cool
---
Sorry to hear that. Always tough when something like that happens in life. But it does open you up to other stuff.
---
Doesn't make any difference. You see the enemy character as they exist on the server. It goes a bit whacky when there's packet loss on a poor connection and they start rubber-banding and teleporting but that's clearly not happening here, so the only factor is perplex's ping (which we know is quite normal at 110ms).
---
yah blind obviously
---
His guild, his style.
---
Low level dungeons healers aren't in heal spec?
---
I walked into BWL as feral..... Was a great time still!
---
That place is one of the worst of the worst subs. I got dumped, doesn't mean I hate women.
---
WoD launch was the worst because of a massive DDOS attack. MoP had some quest bottlenecks but as far as I can recall the servers did just fine.
---
OP is right. We need a containment server for these people.
---
I do believe we'll get TBC servers, but I think it'll be several years out. I do not think your "current" classic WoW characters will be able to be migrated over, it will be a fresh start.
---
This is of course all speculation, but I think classic WoW will do well.
---
Tear of elune i think its called. Ashenvale quest reward that makes you god mode for 10 seconds
---
I dont want to dilute the innocence that ks *WoW Classic*
---
It's a BOE, everyone should have needed it to stop it from being "ninja'ed"
---
Didnt expect to see hunter so low as well. I think rogue and hunter will be higher than the poll shows tbh
---
I want tbc reworked with no flying
---
It is sharding though, just limited between your own realm and doesn't change your instance as often. I don't know if you're in the beta or played the stress test, but phasing between layers on the stress test was not a good vanilla experience at all. It felt just like the social disconnect retail has. People love vanilla because it felt like an actual world, when you saw people, you would continue to see them days and weeks later. When there's multiple layers you never know who you are and aren't seeing, maybe you won't randomly run into an acquaintance you made in stormwind again, you never know who you are missing out on connecting with, because your experience is at the mercy of an algorithm. Its exactly this kind of thing that killed the feel of modern wow, so why would I want it in classic? I'd rather have queues and lag for a week than layering to be honest.

&lt; **Booty Bay Beach Boys** \&gt; **NA-PVP, Horde**
---
**About Us:** We are a group of friends that have been playing together off and on since wrath. We have a relaxed, social atmosphere that enjoys PvP and have dived into PvE content throughout the game‚Äôs lifespan. Without any public recruitment, we have acquired 10 members that I personally know. We are all located in The U.S. ranging from Hawaii to Florida, but mainly play around the Central/Mountain time zone. Most of us are in our early to mid-20‚Äôs, but definitely welcome all ages.
---
**What are we looking for?:** We are looking for all classes that are interested in a social guild that enjoys world pvp and casual raiding.
---
**Goals:** One big goal is to have a positive social environment in the guild. We want to have a fun and enjoyable atmosphere that all members can be apart of. Another goal is to create epic world pvp! Our group has enjoy pvp throughout every xpac and expect it in classic. Last but not least, we expect to progress through all the classic raid content. We do not expect to be world first, though we do want to experience all the PvE that classic has to offer.
---
**How to apply:** Contact me on discord @Hayden#1101
---
It's possible, but statistically you only need a couple hundred for something to be statistically significant. This poll has tens of thousands.
---
I've got to get 2 more reps for 100 on my toon since classic. Then I can at least feel good logging her out for a bit.
---
If you have fun why wouldn't you?
---
&gt; MoP had some quest bottlenecks but as far as I can recall the servers did just fine.
---
There were a few things that broke under load that caused "[quest bottlenecks](https://i.imgur.com/Vod3QYc.jpg)", yeah.
---
I already know theres gonna be a shortage of tanks but warriors are so slow to level.
---
oof maybe I'M misremembering. I could have sworn they reset Wednesday morning. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I anticipate  moving to a two day a week schedule when additional raid content opens up, because continuing an every other week schedule will necessitate a four day raid week.
---
&gt;And no you are not Joana.
---
Hahaha
---
Yes AND at least WOTLK.
---
PM sent
---
This is so cool
---
!remindme 17 hours
---
The demographic is wayyy bigger though. It's not gonna be all private server junkies who "likely"? did the poll(im not sure). I think it'll be mostly people who haven't played in years or never even played classic
---
Good point, but I don't think it's possible to kite her to org, and she didn't use Moonfire :D
---
Oh hunters on top of DPS, that brings back Classic WoW memories.
---
I wonder how many people would stop playing Classic to switch to TBC...
---
I know I wouldn‚Äôt.
---
I've had it up to the gills with these puns
---
Lol ur absolutely clueless
---
Sounds great for me just putting a comment to find you after work.
---
I don't want to turn this into a bashing thread for streamers. If you are interested in my reasoning my DM's are open.
---
I mean i would and i wouldnt. Guess it depends on how long im waiting for TBC
---
Yah it's always a good idea to forget about a system that's always been in place. The reason for needing or greeding seem to get lost when you add someone like nixxiom or esfand in the mix.
---
I mean yeh you clearly are
---
I would play both depending on my mood... mostly tbc tho

---
oh my gosh lol that was so epic
---
For me thrombosis is something I struggle with so I invested in a stand/sit desk from Ikea. It can move from stand to sit in less that 15 seconds so your not sitting the whole time.
---
It really was. I served with a friend i met on woW, who unfortunately didn't end up making it back with us. Best damn healer we ever had. It's shame we were young and dumb. I've decided to make my character based off his, as a tribute. If you ever see an Orc Shaman named SgtDylanMC give him a wave.  Alliance or Horde, I'll give you a salute.
---
His videos were in BC.  His first video was him at level 63.  Still doesn't change the fact that he was THE paladin most other paladins I knew looked up to at the time.
---
What about wind fury? Would this just absolutely destroy?
---
Blizzard is sticking ot their guns with 1.12.   All I'm really saying is 1.12 is the tail end of Vanilla.  Vanilla - when everyone who wasn't raiding Naxx was waiting for TBC.  It's not really about better or whatever.  A person who starts in 1.12 will have a different experience than that of 1.1.  
---
But 1.12 isn't indicative of what Vanilla was.  Not even close.  And we have seen what it has become.  I stopped leveling any characters around 1.6.  I don't know what is accurate and what isn't during this patch, save Naxx.
---
But what I do know is what I'm seeing on stream is comedy gold.  It's brain dead.
---
Not only 10 million subs, but complete market control. 10 million playerbase from 2006 is easily comparable to the 100 million today we see in games like LoL.
---
While classic is great i dont think blizzard intended on people being able to farm end game content indefinitely
---
He has a shield? And you're complaining?
---
Wow his voice brings me back instantly like 10 years. God damn this is exciting.
---
2 week MC clear is hardcore. no argument here.
---
4th week MC clear is probably the average heroic/mythic raider.
---
6th week MC clear for friend and family.
---
after 6 week... well, that's why we have LFR on retail.
---
if new content isn't pushed out fast enough, people will get bored and might not come back for the next one, especially if there's a new raid/expac comming out on retail at th same time.
---
ehhh... what? MoP was... ok..
---
Of course he will, and it's the healer's fault.
---
1st hit, what is the healing doing? 2nd hit, dead. ??????
---
Fine pasta
---
Yeah vanilla isn't that hard man
---
I can read fine, no need for the hostility.
---
Asmond did plenty. He was taking quite a bit of the damage from the mobs. They can't be expected to kite everything. We saw that a few times where the hunters got hit and went a bit low (and who saved them? Esfand...).
---
Hopefully he sits down while taking damage as well, for that sweet rage generation.
---
minimum 2-3 years
---
And they've been hemorrhaging players ever since they started to go all in with that new philosophy. WotLK was the beginning of the end and was carried almost entirely due to people being invested in this decade-in-the-making story of Arthas.
---
Once that wore off and we were just left with all the shitty parts of WotLK without the famous bad guy and setting, it kind of took a cliff dive.
---
They even (and bless them for trying) reigned back in the ezmode shit that was rampant in WotLK, but by that point the cat was out of the bag. You can't make a game east as fuck and walk it back without immense tears...which is what happened. The 5 man content at the start of Cata was some of the most fun I've had in WoW though before they nerfed it to hell.
---
You trolling? Or legit you think looking at an item for 2 seconds. Not comparing it to what you currently have. Not seeing that the mace text is red.
---
Anyways I'm done this back and forth with you. Obviously you are a fan of nixxiom for some reason.
---
Yes please, I would love a way to filter out complaint posts and other negativity.
---
cata was good until they catered to the cry babies, dungeons were a lot more challenging at the start and the initial raids were great. Then it just went down hill..
---
This just makes me sad that I‚Äôm bald - that hair!
---
the best advice i can give you
---
nip drama in the bud or it can ruin your guild
---
Shh, let him keep going. Next he's going to demand everyone to be 3 levels above the actual content or they don't get an invite.
---
Hell, I was a resto druid while raiding but feral otherwise (lots of gold spent on respecs) and with my healing gear I pulled off healing 5 man dungeons as feral many times.

This place is gank city for horde lowbies

&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website, just message me for the discord link. We also have candy.
---
Solid advice. I'm sure in-fighting is one of the key reasons a lot of guilds collapse. Social management must be a huge factor.
---
I'll do what i do every summer. Sweat my ass off and pray that autumn will arive soon. 
---
Kinda glad that Classic releases at the end of summer. This drastically reduces the amount of days that i have swamp ass while playing.
---
what did he say? did he call you an incel?
---
Aw that's cute, the owner sees himself reflected in the dog's eyes.
---
Lmao when that dragon just came. True GoT style...
---
He can't say that with any more certainty than what he's trying to disprove.
---
The sub numbers clearly do show that the majority of players dislike the direction the game has taken. You don't go from 12 million subscribers to no longer even publicly reporting sub numbers by making a game that the majority of your players love.
---
I have to say I agree that they spent too much time listening to a vocal minority, and with the best of intentions ruined a really great game that most people loved and weren't complaining about.
---
the miner johnson shield. so good, so good.
---
yeah, recruitment and drama are probably the hardest things about managing a guild
---
managing attendance and loot and all that fun stuff is work but not difficult work just tedious
---
Ahh yes and I bet you are a multi rank 1 glad with multiple world first kills! I envy how skilled you are at the game, truely awe inspiring!
---
She earned it. That's what made vanilla so great.
---
The "worst" I could see them doing is extending phase 1 and layering longer than anticipated. I don't think there's any chance they'd go into phase 2 with layering.
---
Does Rogue get a lot easier cos I‚Äôve leveled everything to 20 on PS and Rogue was by far the slowest class.
---
I don‚Äôt think they should revert and make real change in retail. I think retail is a different game, and that‚Äôs okay. 
---
I fucking loved Legion, i loved spamming world quests tryna get a Legendary, I loved raiding in a nightmare, followed by raiding in a beautiful elvish city and finally defeating the greatest enemy in wow, the Legion. I loved pushing my limits in Mythic + and getting a random Titanforge BiS. I also very much liked that a lot of Specs that were not good before became very viable, and that other ones became a lot harder. I didn‚Äôt get to really put time into BfA, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that much different.
---
But at the same time, I remember fondly taking 3 weeks of constant gameplay to get level 20 on my warlock because I kept dying and getting lost enjoying the atmosphere, I also remember when a random level 70 showed up and gave me 1 gold and how ecstatic i was to be part of the rich boys, I remember getting a full group and finishing Deadmines the first time and how truly epic it felt to kill a dungeon boss. I remember finally getting max level and feeling like so much hardwork payed off.
---
The point is that, the classic community won, and they are finally releasing Vanilla, so just let Retail and Classic be two different games, at least that‚Äôs my opinion
---
We complained about one alliance guild hogging all the world bosses, and this was their response.
---
https://youtu.be/j7CkeyIksww
---
1 week and he has nothing else to do. raids arent hard. pvp is going to be account sharing at high levels. 
---
cant wait for tbc and wrath.
---
Would 10 hunters with 10 of these trinkets be op in WSG?
---
Who knows what Blizzard is doing over there ....
---
You're expecting an MMO with a monthly sub fee to maintain 12 million subs over the course of a 15 year run. Just not possible no game has done what WoW is still currently doing.
---
Shandris Feathermoon is the name, sorry I just said "Boss" as in a ?? Elite Boss was her tag in-game (not into lore so I don't know much else, sorry!)
---
Idk if they can cancel the  retail 
---
I feel it might not be to bad tho retail can keep away everyone who wants the QoL 
---
Classic route we can get "previously revealed content" but in a different route (that too would keep people away)
---
Shandris Feathermoon is the boss I'm remembering.
---
No, but if i got beta access, I'd sell mine after all the hilarity I've seen on stream.  1.12 .....
---
Who do you expect to know here?
---
I prefer the old animations and models.
---
One streamer I certainly wouldn‚Äôt mind on my server &lt;3
---
Leveling a priest was dreadful
---
Hey dont make this about hunters in general. Keeping your pet from pulling when you dont want it to is good hunter 101.
---
Spoken like someone who never played classic.
---
Why's that?
---
INTP-T gang
---
I would. As a teacher I‚Äôd be able to play it a hell of a lot more than I will when the game launches.
---
Question: Do they already have addons for the beta builds?? How did Asmon get his action bars like that in the beta?
---
The streamers are not even 30 years old.  They have 0 clue what Vanilla was about.  "Back in the day".   lol.
---
Back in the day, they may not have passed puberty yet.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs fine with just the occasional McConnel or Esfand. But when you have both of them plus Mechanic and whoever else in chat talking over Asmon when he‚Äôs doing the stream it can get annoying
---
Nostalgia, the models aren't as cartoony as the current ones. Mostly nostalgia.
---
I think you're kidding but I'm not sure.
---
This was way more fulfilling, though.
---
Yeah, the post is being received pretty well. The top 4-5 comments are praising the sentiment and reiterating what Preach said.
---
How can you be so stupid?
---
&gt; Someone commented "lmao" on a TipsOut meme video, TipsOut proceeded to call the police.
---
Source?
---
You a word.
---
Also A'dal doesn't have a death animation, so he would just look like an unanimated Naaru if he died
---
Not 12 million, but yeah man I'd expect with proper leadership and vision they wouldn't have so many subs that they've stopped even reporting numbers.
---
Your level doesn't really make a difference when kiting mobs with no ranged abilities.
---

He link me to /r/MGTOW. Checked his history and he posts there and some other shit hole subs
---
I didn't had the chance to quest on this map before Cata. And its the first time I'm seeing it. Such a beauty
---
Okay take your upvote
---
Go pull two defias at level 2 in the human area and tell me how you go.
---
Man you had too much banana yoghurt for breakfast today.
---
Im likely going to wait a week or two after launch before I jump back into it. Gives some time for the kinks to work out and server populations to stabilize. Im a little split on whether or not being a week or two behind will be a good idea or not for questing. You dont have to deal with the mass rush of players trying to do the same quests you are, but then of course youre lagging behind for dungeon groups and world PvP.
---
&gt;	I watched the video. He didnt even look at it. 
---
One comment later
---
&gt;	 you think looking at an item for 2 seconds
---
I don‚Äôt know what it is about streamer threads that brings out this level of stupidity
---
I think they'll have both, fresh TBC servers and then TBC servers with a character copy from a Vanilla Classic realm (with normal restrictions like xxx gold cap etc).
---
Welcome to high ping mr euro, we've been dealing with that for the last 3 years

...didn't know the portal thingy to Rut'theran Village existed, so carefully fell off Teldrassil all the way to the ocean. Then proceeded to swim clockwise around the island about 340 degrees; yes, if I had just turned left I would've saved myself a very long swim.
---
...didn't know the Deeprun Tram existed and tried to run to Stormwind as a level 12 (or whatever) Gnome.
---
Getting drunk, playing video-games and taking pictures of your dog doing human things. Looks like a nice night in!
---
I quit because of MoP, came back after for WoD for about 2 months and finally just said to hell with this game.  I couldn't agree more with your comment.
---
this was a bug
---
No. He's the last boss
---
Nothing wrong with a good ole fashioned 'QQ'
---
lol, right?  Fuck those people too.
---
Um, ya Adal did. I kited the Fel reaver to Shattrath in BC and Adal 1 shot it.
---
The 729,980th time this question has been asked.
---
I used kick as part of my dps rotation because come on...kicking something would do damage, right?
---
Waah
---
Indeed. Looking at an item for 2 seconds rolling need. Is indeed. Not looking at a item at all. But infact a ninja. I see you just a troll. Ignoring you. Waste of everyone's time.
---
All game mechanics and itemisation is 1.12. Content and drops are gated behind equivalent phases.
---
For the pvpers that will pass
---
Just wait until AQ is out, dmg will go through the roof and the strategy that Ventuki, soda, esfan speak so highly of will be dead. 
---
You can literally win just by pressing buttons
---
I guess it depends on exactly what data from those things you want. Most of that is going to be stored on the server and only sends the info you need when you need it. Hence why private servers have accuracy issues. They have to plug everything in based on information pulled as needed and uploaded to the various sites like wowhead using special clients.
---
Sorry with surge of F2P during MOP that logic is unrealistic. All good though.
---
I love the website. I don't have beta but I keep checking this website to see what kind of addons have been updated for when classic launches.
---
I'd like to make a suggestion though.
---
Could you add a "Wish List" feature or something similar? So that users can save a list of the addons they'd like to keep an eye on for the future.
---
Maybe mark them as favorite and have a favorites list available in your profile. I think the wish list could be better though if you cpuld create multiple wishlists and share them with friends. I could send a friend a link to my "Leveling helper addons" or "Money Making addons"
---
Just some ideas. Keep up the great work! Hope you can implement something along these lines.
---
yes!
---
I joined wow during wrath and could've swore I was able to shadowmeld during combat for another ambush. Or a command allowed me to leave combat to meld then ambush. Was this a thing? Everything I read says this isn't in classic.
---
&gt; you miserable individual you

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection
---
**Psychological projection**
---
Psychological projection is a defence mechanism in which the human ego defends itself against unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually rude may constantly accuse other people of being rude. It incorporates blame shifting.

Read the player base. My guild lost all the players who were good. Cuz casuals members, whom while they did care alot were preventing the guild from progressing. As a result the top end raiders left 
---
They guils went on happily ever after doing normal mode. Until the guild leader and raid leader broke up and the raid leader went and joined everyone else who left.

&lt;Ghouls Gone Wild&gt; | OCE-PvP | Horde | Semi-Hardcore
---
Greetings! We from &lt;Ghouls Gone Wild&gt; truly hope that you are as excited as we are for the release of Classic World of Warcraft! To that end, we humbly invite you to join our newly formed guild in anticipation for the 27th of August release.
---
We strive to offer organised progression, whilst enabling those with busy schedules a chance to experience end game material. Our philosophy is; to meet likeminded people for social interaction, progress through raids and dominate battlegrounds/world PvP. 
---
Requirements: We are currently recruiting ALL classes and specs with a strong emphasis on your enjoyment (play what YOU want to play). We do ask that mature, honest and dedicated individuals need apply.
---
Raid Times: Thursday - 19.00 to 23.00 AEST 
---
                        Saturday - 09.00 to 13.00 AEST
---
We will start progression of MC on the 6th week following release, being Tuesday the 8th of October. Loot Council will be our method of distributing loot.
---
Aside from raiding, we wish to emphasise that you are more than welcome to join for a myriad of reasons. Levelling is one of the most rewarding aspects of Classic World of Warcraft, so we wish to enjoy and explore that together. Running dungeons on a nightly basis will be one of our top priorities throughout the life of Classic. 
---
PvP will also be on the forefront of our agenda. Battlegrounds are a great way to unwind after a busy day of work, especially when coupled with a beer and great bants. These will also be scheduled as to not leave anyone out who wishes to participate.
---
We inspire you to join our newly formed community, with the intention of building something amazing. If you have any questions regarding our guild, then please don't hesitate to contact myself or Moo on discord. Crazy#2348 or Daspectrum#1716

nO oNE RuNS aLl oF diRE MauL
---
As an undead warlock, what is food?
---
Drama like what?
---
All those gnomes and dwarves are part of a guild doing the Amish Challenge. They can only used crafted gear and are organizing a guild.  Crendor and Rubberross are two of these gnome/dwarves. Smeckle and Spy respectively.
---
telling someone they are projecting is a non argument
---
i thought this was an a post showcasing your feelings but its just an advertisement by a """journalist"""
---
sorry dude I'm going to have to give you a freaking downvote.
---
L o l whoever wrote that guide has never played vanilla wow past level 20.
---
Same, atleast twice a day :P
---
Well yeah this is the ultimate problem. If they were optimizing the group you'd just drop the paladin for another hunter. The buffs were never strong enough to justify the raid spot.
---
All done!
---
infighting, loot drama, relationship drama, corruption, etc
---
&gt;never played wow  
---
  
---
&gt;good guild
---
Shaman and Paladin are my favorite. Between those I'm not sure, I haven't played Paladin much because I always main Horde.
---
Priest is ok.
---
I'd probably never play a Druid because I feel like Shamans and Paladins kind of just do what they do better. I know Druids have unique stuff, but Shaman/Paladin just feel better to me.
---
Glad to see someone agrees. I was at -6 last night (on that comment). 
---
It is true gamers have changed. However its the average gamer that has changed the most. 
---
Good on you for working your way through naxx. I got banned shortly after Naxx was released (First big WoWGlider ban wave), alongside my entire guild leadership. I pretty much saw Anub'Rekhan and that was it.
---
Got realm first naxx in WOTLK though, which is nice.
---
memorial day so :)
---
You're definitely right. Considering each layer is supposedly going to hold the population of a single server, it's going to accomplish absolutely nothing in terms of keeping the starter area population down. But it definitely gives Blizzard a justification for saying "See, told you! We need even more sharding!"
---
This is exactly what happened in my guild progressing mythic antorus.
---
About 6 raiders were actually competent enough for mythic, so eventually 6 of us (3 top dps 2 best healers and main tank) just went and started our own guild.
---
holy hell, the huge horde group with a massive dragon right behind them.. fuckin' amazing!!
---
kind of agree...
---
but there's so much more to do at endgame in BFA than classic.
---
if you aren't a raider in classic... you have BRS, strat, scholo, and maybe a piece in BRD... if you are a raider, add about 3 ours of raid on reset day (until naxx atleast).
---
on live, there's literally no end to M+ pushing and the toughest raid take a month to clear for the top 100 guild.
---
*pvE only.
---
Jesus Christ you‚Äôre a fucking moron
---
Raid spot priority, loot priority, calling when to end raids, setting raid times, consumable requirements etc.
---
No enemy cast bar?
---
Take my damn up vote.
---
Arms isnt a pve spec,
---
Definitely Hunter. Early on they‚Äôre busted. Just the pet can solo a clothy.
---
That‚Äôs actually incredible.
---
It also sounds exhausting. Maybe that‚Äôs just me, though.
---
Labeled as Holy till 40 on my priest because I was psyched to help my friends who wanted a healer in bgs... Mostly solo grinding :(
---
Right, so now that you‚Äôre indisputably wrong regarding whether or not he looked at the item (he clearly did), you‚Äôve now moved the goalpost to that he didn‚Äôt look at it *enough*. Which sure, that‚Äôs fine. But that wasn‚Äôt your claim. Your claim was that rolled need because he‚Äôs an entitled shit head. 
---
He‚Äôs familiar with the item and he‚Äôs familiar with what he has equipped. He saw that it was good and rolled need. What he didn‚Äôt realize was that Hunter‚Äôs couldn‚Äôt use maces. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs so hard for you to understand.
---
I‚Äôve never even heard of this steamer, but you have your head so far up your ass that you have to attack me personally as a ‚ÄúNoxxiom fanboy‚Äù or w/e to rationalize someone disagreeing with you.
---
That‚Äôs the thing with Mages, unless you wanna Tank or Heal, it‚Äôs hard to argue against them, because they are so good at everything
---
If you start to boil classes down to what they are good at, then it‚Äôs hard to argue against Mages
---
&gt;We should adjust our approach to the game and our mindsets accordingly.
---
This is never going to happen. People stacked Warrior, Rogue, Mages in Vanilla and there will be even more this time around. You're not gonna collectively alter the community perception of how to play the game. Guarantee the first addon most players will install is a dps meter.
---
lol these guys are lame
---
Idk i have been in many guilds and as high ranking officer i was privy to most guild leaders plans. The best guild i had the guild leader simply said we are to not interfere with certain drama. Typically relationships and infighting 
---
Gear was always roll for need. Ik in vanilla that wont be the case so this might be the only thing 
---
Who might be corrupt?
---
EYYY THATS RIGHT STRESS PT2! Im eager to try n get to 10
---
Live, damnit!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cTkTEpEYfk
---
Hopefully they fix that then. This is one reason why streamers having the beta is super beneficial. No normal people could have found that bug :D
---
Except what they praise about the game isn‚Äôt the frantic rotation-heavy endgame. It‚Äôs the way the game is designed, not as an epeen scoreboard, but as a game. There‚Äôs not even arena, so of course it‚Äôs not going to entice people who solely want to play to boost their score. That‚Äôs still why most of the pvpers are playing live wow, but many say they do that as a job more or less, whereas they‚Äôd rather play the *game* of Classic.
---
Is this methods room for vanilla raiding üòÇ
---
That's why I'm playing mage this time and not rogue. Dal Rends set is the only real viable pre raid weapon so you gotta have it. And fight other rogues, warriors, and sometimed even hunters for it.
---
Shunned on your cake day.  What a shame.  Begone
---
- No because we dont want random people zoning in and out out of nowhere
---
- We get layering, when working propper should have no people zoning in and out and not to many fighting for the same mobs
---
- The wait for mobs does increase your precense in the world by being the guy who cleared an area
---
- That would reduce player interaction since there is no competition
---
These are my reasons.
---
This sub is now recycled asmongold reacts content.
---
Why did the gnome run? It looked like he could have killed him.
---
Retail is for on rails type gamers. Who dont like danger, and dont eant to be assed to make their own story, or to investigate for story. Im a lore nerd, but goddamn does vanilla do story right, and the world obliges with random little books of lore sitting around.
---
Ohhh I see what you‚Äôre saying, yeah, it will be different. But, imo, still better than the last half dozen expansions (/pray).
---
I really liked the Ruthless Gladiator set from season 10. Otherwise I cant say Ive ever been a fan of any hunter set. I will miss transmogging a little bit I have to admit.
---
I had no problem whatsoever at BFA launch, and I'm on bleeding hollow ( top 10 or 12th most populated US realm?).
---
that being said, classic pop will drop by half, at least, a month in when the tourist leave.
---
Agreed. WotLK Classic would fully and unresponsibly take my life.
---
Crendor will kill us all.
---
If I have to wait for a item spawb I just kill nearby mobs to stay efficient.
---
My initial intention was to put no coastline between Teldrassil and mainland Kalimdor but then I decided on a narrow pathway to reflect the relatively narrow pathway that the ferry takes. Seems like a lot of people agree with ya though, so I have added it to my list of new, potential changes for the next update! Thanks :D
---
He's just trying to *bait* you.
---
For me personally, it was when I first heard of the Emerald Dream pserver and realized that I actually vastly preferred Vanilla, TBC, and the first half of WotLK instead of what WoW had become by MoP.  
---
Before then I never considered that being able to play vanilla WoW would ever again be possible, so I never gave it much thought.
---
\^ he knows. I consider myself an expert and I've only put in 360 hours.
---
Amen. I wouldn't dare.
---
Maybe we should first enjoy Classic when it gets released before thinking about future. :P
---
No honestly man. I'm not rationalizing anything. Least of my worries are spending this much time on reddit doing the old back and foreth arguing over something I have my own opinion about. You seem very dedicated in proving me wrong though lol. And infact you spend an enormous amount of time in these subs it seems from your history. I can see I am beat by your karma and arguing experience here. Must lead a very fulfilling life I think. Have an awesome time my friend. Making me lol now
---
its just cause its different than what we have now
---
For a decade wow players have cried about their characters being just nameless peons and the narrative being far away from the player, blizzard then turned wow more into a singleplayer experience, even going to the extent of making us into warlords and high priests and ofc everyone hates and wants to be nameless again
---
They do! There are a handful of popular WoW race mods out there, all of which ought to be compatible with BetterAzeroth. Ultimately, I have every intention of making my own races (or, \*BetterRaces\*) to fit with the mod as well. I want a full experience!
---
Thank you!!!! :-)
---
I'm excited you're excited!
---
Giant Stalker would be great if it wasnt for the massive shoulders. Always looked super silly on dwarves.
---
Not even. Roll a mage. Get to 15/16. Try to kill one of those lvl 15 worgen near sepulcher..one resist..two resist..and now youre running. Same with defias pillagers. Oh shit, a judgement resisted? Dodged two of your white attacks? Welp, eat these 47 damage fireballs lol. Its stuff your own level that kills you, doesnt have to be something 3 lvls above.
---
Brings me back to the start of my raiding career in ice crown. Taunting off the tanks when I thought they were sure to die. 
---
Even funnier the times I‚Äôd lay on hands and if they went straight back down low I‚Äôd bubble them lmao.  Some times I‚Äôd even bubble myself and taunt. Only for the boss to smack a healer. 
---
There was actually a few times it saved the boss kill. Miss my paladin schenanigins
---
Lol i lost officer cuz i called a raid once after 12  wipes and not increasingly better attempts. 
---
My brother was also an officer and plead that it was a good call (raid leader and guild leader didn't make the raid and i was main tank)
---
In the end the rest of the guild was just to salty and didn't understand
---
I jumped down into the lava pit in Ironforge with my level 20 gnome mage, I died and then jumped down with my spirit to revive but I couldn't figure out how to get out so I deleted my character and started over.
---
&gt;Esfand literally saved the whole run with his emergency heals to let gachi (the priest) recover mp5, and his clutch lay on hands when they were about to wipe His blessings helped asmon keep threat and mitigate damage, the healer regain mana, and the hunters deal dps
---
I mean while I'm not going to get into the argument about playing for fun vs min max. The whole point of why its more efficient to just bring another hunter is because a hunter does 10x the damage of a prot paladin at this level. Its the same reason top level guilds will drop healers for DPS on live in mythic raids. The fast you kill something the less damage you take, the less healer mana you use.
---
Yeah buffs are nice and clearly you can still finish the dungeon, but it would be "better" to have a hunter instead.
---
i don't think it's as alienating to their viewers as you think it is.
---
Hey, if you happen to find it, I'd love to take a look! There are so many different interpretations of Azeroth (let alone just classic Azeroth). This was my first time making a mod, let alone a map mod for Civ 5, so I would love to see someone else's perspective of things!
---
if you dont like it, dont watch it you fucking ni99er
---
Someone made this same post a couple weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bo3xcj/survey_personality_type_class_role_and_faction_is/
---
Don't know if they ever posted the results.
---
I'd give it worse than a 0/10 if I could. Hate the layout, and that valley with the fire elementals and harpies is the worst.
---
Gotcha, so now it has nothing to do with the clip but about me personally.
---
&gt;	Least of my worries are spending this much time on reddit doing the old back and foreth arguing
---
And yet here you are, and after claiming you ignored me.
---
Take care buddy
---
ISTP Virtuoso... Priest Main, going to try shaman now
---
I‚Äôve been busting my ass on home renovations / landscaping and have gotten into really good shape for the past several months and plan to keep doing that until the end of August.  That way I won‚Äôt feel bad and my wife won‚Äôt be able to say a damn thing when I sit on my ass and play WoW with all my free time instead for the next couple of years.

Glad someone understands. Misses/Resists/Crits can be real harsh in Vanilla. Sure the game isn't "Hard", but it can fuck you up if you're not paying attention or if you get unlucky.
---
That quest was fucking cancer
---
Saying retard isn't exactly new, and it's not limited to big streamers, it's been a part of peoples vocabulary for YEARS
---
Username does not check out.
---
This is a pretty retarded post.
---
It was the top few that completely broke. Illidan was down until 3 AM, and then the auction house didn't work for a week, which was *great*.
---
Lol  yah. Conversations are fluid I guess. But here let me follow you and read your posts from now on. You seem like you really like to get into it with people. Could be mildly entertaining when I'm bored at work.
---
I‚Äôm so pissed off I threw mine out 2 years ago
---
loot corruption, it has to do with loot council, people giving their friends/girlfriends etc priority on gear
---
if you aren't in a guild with loot council you probably won't have to deal with it other than stuff like thunderfury which usually goes to tanks anyway
---
I put rogue using guides at 50 hours per week and it gave me 1.1 month. Basically a month after release exactly. Not bad. Not bad. I can actually see that being about accurate.
---
We as a community must keep blizzard to their word. Phasing/Layering must end 1 month after launch,
---

You're correct. Was more saying I was trying to recall if frost started to swing in its power before or after icelance. Ice lane was definitely a game changer, as between running a rank 1 for the chill proc, and running a max rank for an instant 1k+ crit, you could do some damage.
---
&gt;Blizzard isn't new to massive launches
---
That hasnt stopped them from fucking up every launch previously, summer child.
---
Arcanite reaper isn't really worth making after phase 2 I think, and even during phase 1 it's questionable whether you will make money. 
---
Lionheart Helm is worth making and fetches a high price but the plans are very rare, and it will set you back just buying them I think.
---
I would.
---
But are they really? I find no reason to sub right now because they said no more beta invites are going out. Unless I missed something?
---
Good catch but he isn't exactly rare so it might have been a bug
---
I was a casual. It took me forever to get to 60, but when I reach 60 I felt so accomplished. I only logged on a few hours a day, but I enjoyed every second I was on that game. 
---
I eventually found a guild and did some raiding. NOBODY wants an easy experience that's not rewarding. You think you do, but you don't.
---
This is tremendous. I wonder if you could use the Pontoon Bridge UI from the Civil War scenario as a stand-in for the Thandol Span?
---
The damage values are exactly the same, it's been confirmed by a blue.
---
Hunter man, hunter can literally kill anything by kiting if they dont have an epic mount
---
Also enhancement shaman, they could 1 shot you if you dont have gear
---
Civ V is my favorite and I've put in somewhere around 1,000 hours and my roommate probably has more. Long live Sid Meier!
---
Anybody perhaps know a source for the later edition of the strategy guide? Apparently the first edition that everyone has contained many errors due to it being written for a beta version of the game. The later edition was made with the release version of WoW. I probably wouldn't have much use for it because, well, the internet... but it'd be nice to have.
---
by stopping a discussion regarding toxic behavior propagated by large audience streamers?
---
does that make it ok?
---
Never a GM or primary raid lead, but a founder, officer, manager and off-raid leader. Once youre established, it becomes much easier, its certainly still a bit of a time sink, but its manageable. The biggest key to managing a guild is to delegating. Ive been in guilds where the GM tries to do everything himself and its doomed to failure as soon as he has to leave for 1 week. 
---
Assuming youre trying to do this yourself, the hardest thing to do will be to get started. Youll have to just spam recruit randoms, do lots of dungeons with people and start connecting with peolpe that want to be build a raid guild. Get vent/TS/Discord or whatever to get people to talk to eachother. Once you find a small dedicated group of officers, you can recruit for raid content. Do lots of dungeons and push your numbers to 40, be organized, ensure you delegate to move things along quickly. Up to this youll want to be burning 4 hour days to ensure people are getting along and to keep people getting geared in 5 mans for gear and to gel. Once raiding is well established, its smoother sailing as long as your progression is decent.
---
I feel really dumb and dont know how to set these as desktop wallpapers, could you explain this to me like im 5?
---
&gt; bears (unless you skin them, of course)
---
It makes sense.
---
You still won‚Äôt get the massive population of people who won‚Äôt sub until love release
---
Sounds like you were gonna quit after 2 days anyways so hey, you saved some money.
---
The Fish Terminator if you're talking about the ZG one
---
Maybe not now, but they definitely encouraged more people to sub than they could potentially invite into the beta when they put the post of originally.
---
No, but it makes you a fucking retard for trying to have this discussion here of all places.
---
Alexensual told me my hamster is a blizzard shill and I believe him.
---
There comes a certain point where the word loses the negative connotation because of how commonly used it is, so yeah, kinda
---
Yes. I would be willing to sub to get in, so in that way I would be willing to pay
---
When you think about how many hours you can spend in it, then I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong in paying for it. Money for entertainment is a common thing, even if progress gets deleted
---
I just can't imagine them putting out expansion servers because where do they stop. It would look bad to only release the first 3, unless they could market it as some kind of "classic trilogy", but even then it's potentially admitting your game was ruined over time
---
where else would you have it? why would you call me that?
---
2004. No contest.
---
"As they exist on the server"? That doesn't make sense to me as a counterargument. I can move my character around freely in my client, regardless of any lag spikes or latency. That means that the server MUST be constantly getting my position from *my* PC. And what that means is that the server's updates of information on players' locations is going to be affected by latency. The only practical way around this I can think of would be to do some weird motion prediction thing, which I'm not sure if they have ever implemented.
---
But anyway, I also think that you're wrong just based on my personal experience in Vanilla, because I remember having to position myself closer or farther away to be considered in "melee range" for different players, even though my ping stayed constant.
---
Its the internet and i can say whatever i want, retard.
---
Sorry. I edited my post and explained further as to why I think you are a fucking retard.
---
Another great example would be pictures of 2 bare butts: one at Classic launch and another 2 weeks later.
---
At launch - clean.  After launch - dingleberries, roids, rushed wipe jobs and covered with red blemishes &amp; sores from sitting to long.
---
Don't get lured in by the "GF" thing.
---
And with that I mean don't let a woman get cozy with you or one of your officers as this usually leads to Preferential treatment. This shit only leads to drama especially if loot is being funneled to her "For reasons" and I have seen too many guilds crumble because of it.
---
If one of your Officers does start to fall for that then either remind him to stay neutral when it comes to decisions or demote him to a normal member/raider.
---
Lol get your pc shit off here and turn off the internet. Fucking pussy. People like you are so pathetic. Offended over some fucking WORDS. Retard
---
Not exactly 15 years of content, Blizzard really enjoys removing content to rehash it, but worse
---
Ironic...?
---
Sounds like a good weekend.
---
Isnt this known?
---
Like i think even g4 did had this in an episode, as well as the only ranged wepon for pallies in decolace.
---
there are a ton of examples of communities coming together to not tolerate hate speech, and that is exactly what using the word is. it's hate speech
---
Pure too. Very nice.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs really fascinating watching how some people unravel at the slightest disagreement. Take yourself for example- I pinned you into ad hominems within 4 comments and made you incapable of forming complete sentences within 5.
---
Go away please.  Why not just play BfA if you want WoW with a ton of QoL / instant gratification features added?
---
nice dude, you're a real shining beacon of light from the community.
---
if someone uses the word problematic i can almost guarantee i won't like them
---
Ok, go cry about it on twitch boards, this isn't the place to discuss peoples vocabulary. This is a board for World of Warcraft
---
Yeah, that was super early into Wrath. Like Ulduar.
---
This saying is a lot more intuitive if it's said, "Don't look inside the mouth of a gifted horse".
---
 Never liker this zone, even as Horde, but discovering the "hidden" path from the Barrens to it was so awesome, made me feel as if i was into some hidden secret. Same with the path to Hinterlands.
---
Can I have a link to them saying no more invites?
---
yeah I spoke with the guy who made that post about the results. He has to pay 50 dollars just to see the results. I'm running into a similar problem, because I want the results to be filtered by how many people made the same responses. Seems like I have to pay for that feature as well.

Oh shit, that would be amazing! Since BetterAzeroth's inception, I have toyed around with the idea of including infrastructure like that. Depending on how the Beta is received, I think it would be great to have an alternate version of BetterAzeroth, or a separate scenario, that includes bridges like that as well as perhaps roads, accurate City States (which was part of the initial build), accurate starting points, and ultimately custom races too since - there are already a handful of mods that attempt to do that.

yeah im not NA but suddenly a wild NA alt is on the cards

i hope some guild carries him to some good t2 or whatever, he mentioned not being sure if he will raid

random af comment i love it

&gt; it‚Äôs really fascinating watching how some people unravel at the slightest disagreement.
---
We all need hobbies lol
---
The sexy HR girls.
---
Yeah almost to a fault. vanilla, for some new comers during the early levels, might be discouraging with leveling your weapon skill while missing constantly or the enemy dodging / parrying ...
---
Or as a caster a mob resists 3/5 of your spells and between that and the spell push back you die just to autos at level 6 lmao it's fucking brutal
---
YES! Civ V is a legendary game, and if not the best of its 4X genre. Having a roommate who plays too probably makes it even better. My roommate is my cat, Dillon. All he does is occasionally sit on my keyboard.
---
Stop trying to police what other people are saying. If they are acting like idiots don't watch thier stream. Vote with your wallet so to speak.
---
Classic had some pretty big solo grinds too. Rep grinds were harsh.
---
Even just getting enough gold for an epic mount was a serious grind.
---
&gt;gnome rogue is better than dwarf
---
you don't know shit about what you're talking about man
---
They know it‚Äôs coming, but they also know the population will fall off after a couple weeks regardless, so they would never go out and invest in a ton of infrastructure to fix that

**#1 I noticed that the Stormwind Keep's background scenery is missing from the game.**

Different experiences. 
---
MoP was like, the best expansion for the modern WoW game design. A lot of Classic enthusiasts might not like that because its so different than Classic's design.
---
Maybe its because the level cap is 30 and all of the content is not available in  beta.
---
https://willitclassic.com/
---
Here's one of the addon sites people are starting to compile for stuff to use in classic
---
you might not have seen my post so i'm replying to you directly
---
do not listen to that guy he doesn't know wtf he's talking about, gnome is trash for pvp as rogue, you already have like 3 ways to remove roots as rogue, dwarf is way better because you can remove blinds and bleeds
---
Looks like a bug to me.
---
Holding the flag fills a 'buff' slot so maybe some spell is cast/removed when you drop it? And therefore putting it in the spell batch window?
---
I don't recall this ever happening in retail vanilla, though.
---
You miss 30% outdoor speed in cat as a druid if you dont go feral, which cuts down a LOT of travel time from 21-29
---
It takes so much longer to get to end game in classic though and there is so much to do a long the way. You can't compare the pacing at all. In retail you can spam dungeons to your hearts content with ease. Being able to spam run dungeons was less of a thing in classic.  There was meaningful progression in all forms of content be it doing dungeons, professions, or working on reputations.
---
I may be a bit biased here though because I don't considering doing the same content over and over but just on a higher difficulty a meaningful, rewarding progression experience.
---
You can effectively tank lower dungeons with a 2h. Full leather could be on the riskier side though.
---
&gt; There will be SO many players who believe worth is defined by a damage meter, and then wonder why they fail. 
---
I mean lets make this clear, would the group have been more efficient with 3 hunters instead of 2 hunters and a paladin? Keeping in mind that the hunters were doing over 10x the damage of the paladin. Like people can play whatever they want to have fun but saying "the group would be better off with another hunter" is not at all wrong. They would have cleared the dungeon easier.
---
&gt; Vanilla had hybrids and support classes. The 'Holy Trinity' was nowhere near as clear cut and defined as it is on modern wow now.
---
This is absolutely a rose tinted glasses version of vanilla. There was a holy trinity, hybrids were by and large utter dogshit. Paladins were not support classes they were healers, shamans were not support classes they were healers, druids were not support they were healers.
---
The ultimate reason why modern WoW dropped the idea of support classes was because in Vanilla it didn't work. Raid groups quickly learned that bringing a hybrid class that does 50% the damage of a warrior but can buff the warriors damage was almost never worth it over just bringing another warrior.
---
Do I think the concept is cool from a gameplay perspective? Sure, but the reality of vanilla is that support classes do not have a purpose, almost all of them were just healers who brought some buff, no different then a priest.
---
Because most of the viewing audience are uneducated dickwads so they can relate to the steamer.
---
Downvote as you see fit.
---
Nah they‚Äôre really good.

You‚Äôre in the clear minority if you think they‚Äôre bad.

I‚Äôm just trying to find your highlights so I can compare you but I couldn‚Äôt see any....
---
As someone who works with the handicapped in a group home, I can assure you that they call each other retards all the time. I don't think they're as hung up on the word like most "normal" people are.
---
There's been releases and moments where the sub numbers shoot back up to millions, they just no longer have a game that keeps people engaged anymore though. There's only so long you can be interested in raising your ilvl, after that it's the social aspect that keeps you in.
---
The solution to that is utilizing cloud hosting. Pay Microsoft or Amazon to host server instances for a few days to handle the load through Azure or AWS. It would be silly to buy physical hardware for it, I agree, but cloud hosting lets you rent as many as you need.
---
She's technically a high elf (though she does use the Nelf model).
---
and streamers using the word retard are tacitly promoting a community that is intolerant of people with disabilities. its not a good look for the devs, for the community, and for this subreddit.
---
I could be mistaken here as i didnt play a warrior in vanilla, but im pretty sure Arms was used in PvE up untill naxx when Fury became more viable?
---
Hes now the three eyed raven.
---
My hobby is WoW -- people that meltdown publicly is just a perk
---
Thought the best way to level as a rogue was to gouge, then backstab. "Swords are for warriors" was said unironically.
---
Stonetalon was my first pvp zone back in the day. I was a huge noob and played a Tauren Hunter. I still remember the adrenaline rush as my pvp flag went up, then obsessively checking my tracking for enemy players while I killed Grimtotems. Hype.
---
Shadow priest and hunter
---
I played night elf when I first started playing, and I wanted to get to Stormwind so bad that I tried to kill myself on eastern shore of kalimdor then proceed to try to cross the great sea as a ghost spirit wisp. I didn‚Äôt realize you had to take a boat like right at the harbor outside darnassus lol

I played vanilla, and I played some modern through legion and quit. I was always casual and always behind the curve. I'm bad at video games. Im a smart person, but I just never really grasped WOW on the level of my friends and family. Everyone was so good, that eventually I felt like I was slowing them down and bowed out. They were always cool about it, but didnt change my feelings. I would level alone to not bother them. In other words, some folks are just uncomfortable playing casually with people who play more than casually. It can be hard to "chill out" if you feel stupid or under prepared. That's my reasoning, not necessarily OPs. As you said, I agree. People should just chill and enjoy this game, as it is fucking dope. It can be more complicated sometimes though, especially for those of us that dont want to hamper other people's fun, or success in dungeons.
---
I remember this as well. Everyone was gearing themselves to the teeth before TBC, just to replace their BIS on either a random drop, or a quest reward as soon as they entered the Dark Portal.
---
Not gonna lie, my stupid ass resubbed for a month to try my luck at getting into the Classic beta.
---
So far, nothing. Not even a stress test. I tried BfA again but gave up after 3 days.
---
It could be a bug there was definitely pve mobs that spawned from a quest in the keep near him during vanilla 
---
forget the names of the mobs but they are like the dragon men things that spawned in the room to the left from the ony quest i think
---
Im not saying i know for a fact he did not attack mobs , but there certainly was mobs that spawned near him so they may have turned him off. 
---
i have video but it cuts off before i can see if he engages them duing the pre tbc patch
---
I feel classic needs loot council. 40 players 3 drops per boss... wont be able to gear up players at a reasonable pace
---
In that situation, you are having to predict where the hitboxes are going to be by the time your position update gets to the blizzard server (aka after a delay time which is equal to your latency). In the situation presented here, Stabbers does not have to compensate (we think). On his screen, it most likely appears as though Perplexity is in melee range, so he doesn't have to compensate at all, when in reality, the position information is probably greater than 5 yards when it meets up at the server.
---
I believe in Vanilla WoW you had to compensate much more. That's just what I remember though.
---
fuckin zoomer
---
No thank you.
---
Hunter because hunters have less weaknesses + different types of playstyle
---
My preferred playstyle:  Always have aspect of cheetah on, see someone to kill, send pet run opposite way. They either try and chase you, in which you keep running and youll always be faster so they cant. They will try to attack pet or run opposite way. At that point, you engage them at max range and theyll try to chase you again. If they are chasing you on mount, its easier because they cant attack pet so you just have to keep running and let pet knock most of their health down. Once they get in max range, turn around while jumping and throw a concussion shot to slow them down. Or use pet to cast intimidation to stun them.  Keep running away till you win. If they are attacking pet and pet is dying, (put pet on stay so they arnt back pedaling towards you while killing pet), just run out of range and pet will disappear and you can call it up again and heal it before sending it in again.
---
Hunter is so stupid broken, it's hilarious how easy it is to kill literally any other class by pure technique and tactics. Even when they severly out gear you, you can still stand a chance against them just because you play cheap.  It's not until they get their epic mounts that they might be able to stand a chance vs your cheap playstyle. 
---
Rogues are by far the easiest class for hunters to kill. I purposely let them attack me first and bring me down to 20% so i can laugh in their face, because that is how confident my ability in killing them is. Basically at that point I will feign death + frost trap macro. Run to max range, hunters mark, cast aimed shot, and serpent sting right after. At this point, they will either vanish or use sprint to chase you. Both dont work, because serpent sting gets them out of their vanish, and sprinting towards you they cant catch if you are in cheetah and running away, which you should be. You should have your pet on them the whole time and cast intimidation to keep them stunned. 
---
Warriors are second easiest, followed by pally. Only real trouble would be warlocks and druids, but even then, if they are not good or outgear you significantly, they are easy targets. Especially warlocks because they are squishy. But balance druids can moonfire your aspect of cheetah so its harder to kite them.
---
Rogues.. rogues are kinda only fun with gear. And you are slow in stealth, so you wont have as much fun as you could with a hunter.
---
I thought they fixed that?
---
Melt down?  You got it all wrong. I was feeling pretty good about our whole conversation. Like I definitely won this thing. You basically just quoting shit out of context makes you look like a desperate loser. Do it again lol
---
It's the euphemism treadmill. Insults have expirey dates. Retarded was for several decades just a means of calling someone impared. Now it is mostly used as a non-committal insult, and we have a host of words that serve it's old function.
---
Retard.
---
Hey man that's pretty retarded
---
Shaman is the most rewarding
---
and druid is probably the most handicapped class in the game.
---
&gt;Well, this is the way vanilla was, and we loved it even with its flaws.
---
And we cried our eyes out in the forums in the hopes blizz will fix this shitshow of balance\*  
---
Might add that as well, when you are at it. Because that was the reality off many class sub forums way back when. I didn't love Vanilla for it's flaws, but rather despite it's flaws. Doesn't mean I don't want a "flawless" product.
---
Or a hunter pet
---
U mean Adderall, supplements, coffee, and protein bars :D
---
yup, just like real vanilla
---
https://youtu.be/olHCy4QEc58?t=593

Just pause it at 9:53. It's not possible to make out Bolvar among the guys underneath Teremus, but at 9:53 you can clearly see that he is not present (which is to say he is currently engaging Teremus.)
---
What a troll
---
I guess you are just ignorant. Some launches went pretty well.
---
You think there will be more gold farming (think Chinese) in classic than there was in vanilla?
---
People were very good at making gold in classic, particularly the Chinese farmers that made up the RMT.
---
More than likely out of Blizz's office in California
---
I nutted even faster the second time I watched it. Thanks for the repost, mods!

*-Ohhhh he might have went on living, but he made one fatal slip -When he tried to match the dwarf with the big iron on his hip*

Would this mean that I would use it in raids even with the limits in classic?

Retard

This is actually still in the credits page of the current beta client.
---
Plain old balance. In all directions, raid and dungeon difficulty, class balance come to mind. I'm not saying homogenize everything, for most classes it's just a numbers game. Reducing mana costs for caster hybrids, giving shadows crit scaling, giving elemental shamans something unique compared to resto would probably help a ton as well. Curse of elements for nature damage ? A way to buff arcane damage. Small stuff like that.
---
You better reel your humor in!
---
Lol they were Testing it because it was a throw away match.

i mean this supports my topic? the show is using it as irony to show how problematic it is?

Ok

\&gt; I see you just a troll. Ignoring you
---
Five comments ago btw
---
You have be experimenting with parody at this point right?
---
Are you actually listening to yourself?
---
You are Morty in this clip, you know that, right?
---
You do have a point. It's like people who use racial slurs and defend it by saying they weren't using in a racist way. It still has the same end effect, normalising derogatory language. Another thing is that kids are impressionable. If they watch streamers who use this language constantly, there's a greater chance they will think it's normal and incorporate it into their own lives, repeating the cycle over and over. Just like someone who is exposed racist beliefs from an early age has a much higher likelihood of mirroring those beliefs later in life. Just because someone has the right to say hurtful things doesn't mean they should. I'm not saying changing word choice is easy, I'm definitely guilty of throwing the odd insult around without thinking about the implications. But people should make the effort to word things more appropriately, instead of blurting out the first word that comes to mind.
---
you really cant be this dense. the show is making fun of people like you

Difference is not all of us are assholes now.
---
Thanks, I am hoping that rogue works out. I tested Fury Warrior on a vanilla repack recently and decided against them. Originally I was going to go mage, but I decided that having to change specs whenever I want to go into Molten Core or Blackwing Lair wasn't exactly an enjoyable concept.
---
Who commented before this comment is shadowbanned.
---
What did they do?
---
It's specifically making virtue signallers like you.
---
You have to be shitposting at this point.
---
It would be cool if after nax is cleared they did a fresh server with  level caps at phases.
---
A group of my mates also re-subbed for a chance to get into beta. No one got in but they're not mad as they knew it be a long shot.
---
They also bought Blizzcon tixs last year to try the alpha.
---
Classic WOW just means alot to some people
---
i agree , year checks out , he is not present , id say yeah its a bug then he should have agro'ed
---
it does make sense i just thought of those mobs and though well i guess possibly they didnt want him to agro the quest mobs
---
It‚Äôs a meme but also it is technically a world first if you look at Classic as a new game, which it kind of is. It‚Äôs cool because they obviously didn‚Äôt have streaming in 2004 so you couldn‚Äôt have reliable ‚Äúworld firsts‚Äù
---
They removed the both of them and redid them as dungeons, but worse
---
if you truly want to be educated, use people first language when referring to a disability. its not hard to say "person with a disability" instead of "retarded"
---
Np man, I was wondering the same thing a couple days ago. Good luck
---
A lot of people just want to play the game - and that‚Äôs fair. But there‚Äôs is a reason for a beta. I‚Äôve cringed a lot seeing ‚Äúpro‚Äù streamers playin the beta -clearly a lot of the streamers haven‚Äôt played vanilla or is just not suitable for a game with more spells than their amount of brain cells. That said -the streamers is the absolute best advertisement for blizzard since they ain‚Äôt the best to marketing their already known World of Warcraft. Beta should be for public ‚Äútesters‚Äù who cares about the game and would report every little thing they find off. Not People who can‚Äôt wait, want to make leveling strats or just have money to share.
---
Was preach a skeptic? I haven't been following him since WoD when I still played and I was a big fan of his videos. Even back then he was talking about how things like flying or transmog were a mistake so it's surprising to hear he was a skeptic
---
You think you do but you don't ....
---
The only beta I‚Äôve ever gotten access to was MoP, which I got into by paying for a year sub. I see myself playing classic in a year, no doubt, so I‚Äôd totally be willing to buy a year sub to get beta access.
---
Find someone in wow. that's what i did and we've lived together for 2 years
---
Honestly i dont know how this isnt a bigger issue. Thhe whole game literally lags, whether its waiting for a mob to have its loot available to be picked up after it dies. To buying / selling gear to a vendor. To accepting a quest from an npc. To literally anything there is a noticeable delay and it feels awful to play with. This was NOT present on the demo and ive played both the demo and the stress test. What they did to simulate spell batching was to literally have the entirety of the server on a huge delay. This makes it annoying to try and kite mobs as a melee because the mob will be in a different place than what the client shows and the mobs reaction time to moving when your character moves is also delayed. I wish they can limit spell batching to only spells since thats the purpose of bring it back. Things like double sheeping or fearing interactions etc.
---
We play online together sometimes, with a few people.
---
It's not about nixxiom and I never cared about winning that. If there even was something to win. I won in my first statement. This is more now just entertaining. You must have a lot of time on your hands to be able to do something so meaningful.
---
Are you at work? Whar do you do for work?
---
Not hate speech bro. Pretty sure they gave that one back. Its dated as a medical term and no one would use the word to identify themselves. No teacher has a flock of retards, or gaggle of retards or even a murder of retards. Its just not used anymore so how can it be hate speech if it doesn't identify a type of person any more.
---
As i've mentioned in other threads, getting gear for Druid PvP can actually be extremely easy depending on how proficient your raid group is. There are quite a few pieces of gear in MC/BWL that no one will want (Wristguards of Stability, Aged Core Leather Gloves, Draconic Maul, Taut Dragonhide Shoulderpads, Malfuion's Blessed Bulwark, etc) and then once you can pick up some ZG gear and finally AQ 20 gear, you're basically 80% of the way to being fully feral geared if you're so inclined.
---
I raided a lot so I had a lot of extra DKP but I didnt even use it most of the time. As for ranking in PVP, if you have a pre-made and act as a pocket healer, it really isnt that bad. Getting to rank 8 is super easy with a reasonable play schedule and gives you 4/6 of the set. Getting to rank 9 is also not bad and rank 10 represents a bigger jump but is still doable if you focus for a week or two to make sure you get it.
---
Making your own stories with people on your server is the best part of MMOs to me. I'll never understand the appeal of the FFxiv style of stories in MMOs
---
not sure bro but i think you should pay $15 for a chance to play a beta that will have all its progress wiped bro
---
I could have sworn that you could not use special attacks with a fishing pole. Perhaps that doesn't matter if you're just looking for auto attacks against higher level targets though?
---
Stacked str on my hunter thinking it would make him pull his bow back harder.
---
That would remove the whole point of calling you a fucking retard.
---
Because if I called you a "person with a disability" that means i'm actually an asshole who is actually trying to disparage disabled people.
---
I choose to call you a fucking retard because it is vacuous, holds little meaning, and gets my points across effectively, retard.
---
do you really have no context? dan harmon is pretty far left and uses his platform for issues like this. i know the epic burping science man is your spirit animal but the show is using that as a metaphor for mental illness
---
Youre fine. Just dont be a jackass and try to improve at the game when you see youre "falling behind" skill or knowledge wise.
---
holy fucking shit this guy is so fucking good at pvp bros gonna subscribe to him RIGHT now!!!!!!!!!
---
Youll be completely fine, game will be there for you as well as majority of other players.
---
It's funny because this is obviously a troll post.  but there are people who unironically make these type of posts on the forums
---
FWIW Happyminti didn't play that warlock very much, I know because I was in his guild Seraphin on Zuluhed and I'm the warrior he crit in that video. Not hard to get a big crit when the warrior pops recklessness and you use a bunch of trinkets.
---
Not much to take away from that video other than Minti really liked rogue.
---
People here don't remember that originally warlock death coil didn't have a horror effect and that Warlock was slowly buffed over time (including the warlock patch). They were fairly mediocre for the first 6 months - 1 year of vanilla.
---
Cringe.
---
To be fair, my buddy was a raider on Madoran in our 8th grade year on Madoran. They cleared up to AQ40. So he def is ‚Äúback in the day‚Äù.
---
&gt;Six comments ago
---
It worked for me.  I was going to let my sub run out until classic but I saw you had to be subscribed to get in.
---
I was lucky though and got in 2 days after all the streamers.
---
Blizzard needs to open up the beta a lot more.  The PvE server at least feels like a ghost town once you get out of the starter area.
---
you have to be kidding if you think people dont use it to make fun of people with disabilities
---
Mate the dragon isn't even in this pic???
---
Wow is this the correct blizzlike behavior? If so that's amazing. I've never heard of that.
---
the experience is better than the result bro.
---
I'm asking a question that you are not sure about the answer, why reply and being toxic?
---
I'm playing on a private server and the amount of noobs we see every day is simply astounding. You'd think that people who know how to get on a private server would know the basics of the game but no, they don't know anything about the game. Even after 200+ hours they don't know. 
---
So you'll find lots of people who are new to the game.
---
check out my edit in the main post. it's pretty easy to change your way of thinking to not offend people even if you dont mean to
---
Common bro. You just getting lazy. I'm afraid you are on your last post here. Dont tell me I'm gonna lose you.
---
Seriously though. What do you do for work?
---
Oh Jesus,you virtue signaling pansy. I never referred to any handicapped person as retarded, that's what they call each other. 
---
what worldview is that? to dehumanize people with disabilities?
---
you'll be fine buddy, just have fun and enjoy 1-60, you'll learn the content as you play
---
most people on this sub are new to the game or from retail too despite what it seems like
---
I leveled to 45 as a disc priest, it was pretty slow but I was able to do dungeons anytime I wanted. I hit 60 after TBC released.
---
It's not fast but I don't remember it being absurdly difficult. Bubble and renew goes a long way.
---
Context isn't necessary. The show had an instance of poignant social commentary and you fall smack dab into the center of it and you don't like it.
---
I actually hate the direction the show went and despise Harmon but a clock is always right at least once a day.
---
There are other options to do so...
---
I still do this. Been playing since vanilla off and on. Maybe that‚Äôs why I suck at wow. I‚Äôm now 24.
---
Dont let this minmaxer bitches fool you. Wow classic was created with casual and noob mmo players in mind. You will enjoy wow classic much more than any one else
---
Your chances of getting now are drastically reduced. Blizzard said last week they pretty much have everyone they need for beta population.
---
"virtue signaling" nice epic meme post. come back when you have something to say of substance
---
Close to none. They made a blue post recently saying they have the amount of testers they were looking for and will be tapering down the invites. Stress tests will still be going on every few weeks.
---
im not being toxic bro im just sayin bro, they already said they are heavily reducing the invites so its not worth it unless you wanna follow streamers around with some EPIC world pvp
---
To bad people on the wow forum hate it and want him banned for it
---
Well it certainly involves dehumanizing and distancing yourself from trying to have any semblance of objectivity in respecting another groups perspective.
---
Would love to seeee the results

I think this is kind of a fun thing to think about 
---
Like if molten core was difficulty 7/10 when WoW was released, then when the talents got stronger the difficulty went down to 5/10
---
So scaling it up to be 7/10 with new talents could be an option. They won‚Äôt do it, but it‚Äôs a fun thing to consider
---
They recently stated that invites for closed beta have rapidly decreased, they have met their pool right now. They will reevaluate and send out more invites when they deem necessary.
---
So you probably won‚Äôt get an invite within the week but maybe in a month or so... who knows.
---
I‚Äôll be starting a guild in Classic that raids ‚Äúofficially‚Äù once a week for 3-4 hours. Me and most of the guys joining me have raided retail at a high level. I don‚Äôt like having to commit more than one night a week to raiding, and I think we will be just fine since Vanilla raiding is quite a bit more laidback until Naxx. Feel free to message me if you‚Äôre interested.
---
I think you're looking for maturity in the wrong place.
---
Thanks for the answer good sir!
---
Thanks for answering!
---
I was in fairly casual guild that used a loot council but the GM could override it if a player had  perfect raid attendance for like 3 weeks. Every once in a while he would just drop a gold star on someone with an attaboy loot. I hated it at first but as I saw super stars pick up their shit and leave for greener pastures I really appreciated all that loot that got spread to the sub-par but hard working and showing up bros.
---
Yes ofcourse my beta is just about to arrive Im 100% sure hahahhaa &lt;crying&gt;
---
I don't know why, but I ALWAYS hated STM. Through my first character all the way to my five-thousandth, STM has been my least-favorite zone to level through.
---
Even though the vanilla WoW community can appear a bit elitistic, players do actually help and encourages beginners.
---
Constructive criticism, small gold donations and general hints is a common sight.
---
A guy gave me 100g near gold shire when I was begging for gold and I spent it on a crimson dragonkin pet.
---
Whatz your weight at? How old are you?
---
its not like he "forgot" his beliefs in this scene, but you are so committed to this line of thinking that you actually think the point was "muh sjws!!!" in a show that routinely makes fun of people with your beliefs
---
there were atleast 20 lvl 60s against our 10man raid group. couldnt push up that tower, so they just sat there and waited for GMs to do something. Alliance server, Alliance GMs.
---
The problem is that it isn‚Äôt 15 years of content in BFA.
---
You either do what the latest patch forces you to do or you do transmog runs.
---
Even the content that launched with BFA is completely pointless to do now.
---
This made me think of the level in Golden Eye 64 where you go into a room like this..
---
Represent
---
That wasn't even a toxic reply. It would probably be in most peoples best interest to skip the beta and wait a couple months.
---
I'm just trying to figure out who I'm arguing with here. CUse I have this picture in my head. Its lol
---
Yeah, i really like some advices and learning new things to improve, thats nice :D
---
The only true hard fights I‚Äôve seen in Classic so far (on p servers) are C‚ÄôThun and Four Horsemen. And they are genuinely. Just beat 4HM for the first time last night and it felt so good.
---
 [https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/34465](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/34465) They have said.  
---
Also check all the topics by blizzard in classic section, it will give you more insight. If you don't know phases then I will assume you don't know much.  
---
Sharding is happening across all of the realms which means tens thousands of people.  
---
Layering will be happening only in 1 realm and the whole population in layer will be pretty much the same as in single full realm without layers, they have said that, layers will not be switched automatically so you will always play with same people unless you relog or invited into group. And after phase 1 is done layering will be taken out and 1 realm will become a single community of thousands people instead of being 1 community of ten thousands random people.   
---
So now could please explain how it full blown sharding?
---
I'm rolling a tank, it's definitely the healer's fault. He could have healed me between the 1st and 2nd hit, but he didn't time it right.
---
Sure I'm wearing cloth because I like the way it makes me look, but the healer had his chance.
---
warden staff dropped and I equipped it on my warlock.
---
Where did they say that?  I remember reading they‚Äôll slowly increase the number in the beta before July to enable different testing.  I‚Äôll see if I can find the source.
---
Of course they can. But will they?
---
What a nice guy! He is very humble about his following. Watched the entire vid and was looking at his stream just now. I can definitely see why people tune in. üòÑ
---
its just that we're not children any more and can grow up. i want to love this game and the community and engage but if this behavior is normalized i'll have a hard time.
---
for me, it's asmongold, i'm on a 17 month sub streak (heck yeah!!!) and every so often (every few hours) i donate the minimum required amount of money so he says my name on stream, it feels like i have a real friend, you know?
---
Which is funny because I don‚Äôt like tanking, but I do because it saves like 2 hours from waiting for a 1.5 hour dungeon.
---
I'm not saying he forgot his beliefs.
---
I'm implying people who disagree on certain subjects can agree on others.
---
You seem to imply because he is a leftist that he is promoting a different narrative, which is indicative of your ignorance, not mine.
---
It\`s a Relief to read this responses. I think ill be doing ok and find some buddies on the way  hahahaha
---
Nope, been using the same addons (might have changed the provider) since cata and played vanilla to wotlk with no addons. Not much of an addon person I guess.
---
It probably felt like 1k because undergeared level 10s in Warsong Gulch had like 200hp. Pretty sure you definitely one shot a few of them, but never for 1k.
---
&gt; and find some buddies on the way 
---
You sure will, that one of the reasons why people love classic, people are frinedly and its a community driven game.
---
Okay well I don't. What does that mean?
---
Except that it doesn't, at all. You're confusing layering - which is basically the exact same as spinning up Azuremyst(1) and Azuremyst(2) for people to roll on and merging them later - with sharding, which splits up every zone into a bunch of dead instances.
---
I remember getting lost in stone talon while exploring on my first character. I got fucked up by ?? harpies.
---
Nope
---
Was rainbow generator cata or nilla... can‚Äôt remember
---
god i love having a best friend.
---
No it wouldn't. Stick to retail.
---
This post is retarded
---
Frostadamus creates solid videos. Mainly youtube and he is also streaming.
---
I think people who paid for a Virtual Blizzcon ticket to play the 10 day alpha should also be extended to a beta invite
---
In sharding you're always jumping between shards when you enter different zone, while with layering you switch only by reloging to your character or joining the group. Also layering will last from 2 week to 2 months - Until phase 2, so in 2 months it will become single community. They also might be turning off it layer by layer so you will be more and more likely to interact with same people. There also won't be so many layers so please don't exaggerate, comping several layers to hundreds or thousands of shards is pretty ridiculous. Tens thousands users versus &lt;10k users are not the same. Several layers versus hunders or thousand shards are not the same either.
---
I wonder if it works on spell casts!
---
Dang, so no mega rip of all the data it seems. I wish I could get my hands on everything. NPC's + Coordinates + Quests + Spell text + Talent text + all the items, professions, simply everything. A little surprised there isn't something like that for any of the WoW versions.
---
I picked Warlock as my first character because I liked the clothes it had in character reation, and thought a caster that used a knife was badass.
---
me too bro, sometimes he even says thanks for the money, can you believe that?
---
Alexensual obviously.
---
The problem with that attitude is where do you stop? Sure add a timer on WSG, and hey while we're at it, lets add reinforcements to AV, or nerf some bosses in raids, so on, and hey look it's not classic any more.
---
TBC was great for the talents and viable builds, but God did I hate that continent. It had no soul put into its design, every region was extremely boring and barren, it felt like a polar opposite to vanilla. I enjoyed going to new regions in vanilla, there was always an atmosphere to absorb but in TBC I couldn't get through it fast enough.
---
i feel sorry for you
---
$60 to get in the beta and have that count towards game time? Yes in a heart beat. Now if it was strictly $60 for just the beta with no added benefits then probably not.
---
This is epic and makes me so sad I am not in beta.
---
Thank you Asmongold!  And special thanks to Catdanny for stealing your content so I can watch it on youtube.
---
Yeah its great when he gets all butthurt b/c of Monkeynews
---
Thank you mods for nuking this. Based.
---
lol granted i found out who he was like 2 days ago. I'm sorry you feel sorry :(
---
they didnt?
---
Oh, thats really really nice to read. 
---
I think it'll be a fun experience after all. Thanks \\o/
---
&gt;I'm just trying to figure out who I'm arguing with here. CUse I have this picture in my head. Its lol  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Common bro. You just getting lazy. I'm afraid you are on your last post here. Dont tell me I'm gonna lose you.  
---
&gt;Seriously though. What do you do for work?  
---
&gt;Whatz your weight at? How old are you?
---
Holy shit I've never done this to someone. This is so amazing
---
Can‚Äôt believe the poison in this thread.
---
they've done this before with pandaria. if you payed subscription for a year you get a [guaranteed beta access and diablo 3 for free](https://www.anandtech.com/show/5003/get-diablo-iii-free-with-annual-wow-subscription).
---
worse beta i've been into :P
---
but yeah, most of the things you want to do in beta you can do on a private server
---
I absolutely would need on it. Everyone on here can pretend that they wouldn‚Äôt but it‚Äôs not like he camped the last roll on it and saw everyone was guessing. He needed and players still chose to roll greed.
---
this made me lol but its so on point
---
Lol ok guess I'm wrong but still probably not as wrong as this article
---
Interested. Druid player.
---
I'm having a good time 2 lol
---
Asmondgold is god tier, Esfand and StaySafe are A tier, as a Priest main i enjoy Kala
---
If you are looking for guides are things like that I have no clue, but if you are looking tobearch some fun idiots play I'd say the obvious sodapoppin, asmongold, esfandtv, staysafetv, mizkif, pokelawls.
---
i mean i didnt imagine the turnout like this but i really hope it's not representative of the community after launch.
---
WoW vanilla is *the* best game that ever was, it exploded onto the scene and defined the mmo genre.
---
You need to download Wallpaper Engine from Steam
---
Yea. It‚Äôs the shock value kiddies. Hopefully less than 1%
---
I went down the same path, my dude. If you‚Äôre into PvP, leveling by battlegrounds has been pretty fun!
---
‚ÄúWell met‚Äù
---
There are people that love you. 
---
They are not us.

Look at me rogue, I'm just fishing over here.  Jebaited.

---
It seems like I have the most fun social experiences with "sticks and raccoons" as you put it. My best friends now came from WoD. We met BECAUSE there was so little to do. I've always found that interesting. Friends came and went over the years, but the ones patient enough to last in WoD are patient enough to stick with me
---

---
He ain't bad, but the amount of backtracking he does on his stance of things is astounding
---
&gt;How is it selfish to be happy they aren‚Äôt wasting their time?
---
Again, WTF.
---
Where do you get off deciding what is and is not a waste of other peoples free time?  It's absolutely self centered to think you have any influence over how people spend their time, and to act like you're doing the world a favor, even more so.
---
Very weird my dude.
---
You'll have a hard time. I was never so brutal to people than when I was in vanilla. It's just too easy with people like you honestly. Don't take life to seriously. If you don't like hate speech, get off the internet? I dunno what to tell you.
---
Yes they did.
---
They removed the post to be visible to the public. Only people with the link or who have posted can see it.
---
It makes you retarded :P
---
What?  We want Classic, not fan fiction.
---
That really depends on the raid makeup and encounter, but usually no.
---
shit
---
I'd resub immediately if I knew I'd get beta access
---
I've mainly been watching Esfand and pretending I'm in the beta
---
Nice edit. 
---
You're being negative on a gaming forum. I made a random thread before it got attacked by a bunch of losers like you for no reason. Like this forum has such high quality content a random post might make it look bad! I'm not being miserable, I find it funny how seriously you weirdos take this place and was poking you with a stick.

Locking and removing this thread. This turned into an absolute shit show.

Classic winds is pretty good. Madseasonshow too.

Overall with any game there will be douchebags but I believe if you stick with it and don't quit within the first couple of months you'll have such a great experience.
---
Don't forget to chat either, ask any question while in game whether you are in a group or not.
---
Make sure you don't get disheartened when you see people blitzing through content or having some crazy gear before you even hit 40.
---
Taking it slow is an understatement, getting a feel for the zones and their levels / flight points / graveyards will help a ton.

MadSeasonShow is my favorite WoW content creator BY FAR
---
Madseasonshow is really chill . Asmongold, Sodapoppin, Esfand, Staysafe, Kargoz, TipsOut, PunkRat....I don‚Äôt like any of them much but you might have a different opinion!
---
Alexensual ofc he knows more about vanilla than anyone I've ever known. We should all be bending the knee
---
Yep this is my dream as well, being able to go into a raid as a shadow priest or ret pally etc and not do 30% of a fury warriors dps.
---
Yeah, looks like he took the flag with him. Rofl
---
&gt;You're being negative on a gaming forum

How did you actually enjoy titanforging and legendaries?! It‚Äôs nothing more than a slot machine that rewards players luck rather than skill.

Leveling as holy priest (albeit with 5/5 wand spec, 5/5 spirit tap and 2/2 improved shadow word pain taken first) is actually optimal before level 45, and only slightly suboptimal after that. Check out my [priest leveilng guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7iieiw/priest_leveling_guide/).

VANILLA BRAIN ACTIVATED
---
It's a rare picture showing the inside of the brain of a classic raider.
---
Druids are just really hard tp play. Whether as resto or feral they are the hardest class to play and require the most consumables.
---
Platinum WoW on YouTube
---
"Just find a friend who..." is the "just stop being poor" of video games.
---
Honestly that‚Äôs just terrible game design. Vanilla was simply like that because blizzard hadn‚Äôt learnt how to balance classes properly yet, not because it was the pinnacle of gameplay design.
---
This seems normal to me. Mobs don't have scaling damage based on the level of who they are fighting, they deal a flat amount that can be mitigated through armor. The armor values between a level 30 and a level 40 are negligible unless you are moving up an armor tier. The biggest difference for survivability between 30-40 is the player's health-pool, the damage they receive is mostly the same.
---
Mop was the worst expansion ever..
---
MadSeasonShow. One of, if not the best, Classic/WoW content creators on the platform. Dude puts a lot of effort into his videos and never disappoints.
---
I didn't mean to say anything, what I said was what I said. They said summer, tons of us thought that meant DURING the actual summer not at the tail end of it. Didn't need some nerd pushing his glasses up onto the bridge of his nose to chime in and go "well actshhhualllly...."  I'll still play the shit out of it, just wish they wouldnt be so ambiguous. Tons of companies give timeframes like early summer/late summer etc for literally anything under the sun, fashion, tv, any sort of consumer product you could imagine. Not that big of a stretch to understand with that big brain of yours my dude.
---
Either a bug or an addon.
---
Make sure you're someone capable of leading. The truth is that not everyone is cut out for it no matter how hard they try. 
---
Have a vision that includes goals and culture. This affects your recruitment, raider requirements, loot rules. Be consistent here and more importantly set realistic goals based on your own ability.
---
Earn your players trust by being honest, transparent, and always putting the guild above yourself or any other individual. I've let great players go that didn't fit with my guilds culture. 
---
If you raid lead, understand it's more work preparing for encounters. This probably won't be hard at all in classic but you still want healing CD orders, kill orders, positioning etc. planned before you get to the boss.
---
The biggest timesink is recruitment if you're anything above a family and friends guild. You need to review logs, spam recruitment macros, browse forums for people LFG. This will eat up hours each week until you're established enough for people to apply to join you directly. 
---

I can‚Äôt speak for anyone but myself, but i was against every single one of those except xrealm bgs and flying.
---
And I became anti flying, despite the noted convenience and exclusive flying only areas, when wpvp died in those first weeks as people started just flying high af between quest giver and object, making the world barren except for people dive bombing for nodes, the elemental farming and people too low a level to have flying. 
---
These things aren‚Äôt hard to predict, and seeing them as negatives is a matter of perspective. My vision of what I want out of the game has been pretty consistent since I Started playing. From that lens it‚Äôs easy to see which features add or detract from your gameplay. 
---
Since it‚Äôs an mmo, my gameplay is directly affected by how others use and utilize the game, so I can‚Äôt just choose to not use LFD. And because lfd exists, the skill floor for 5 mans has to be lower‚Äîsee the difference in bc vs wrath 5 mans (further see the ‚Äúvocal backlash‚Äù in cata when harder 5 mans were attempted again‚Äîmeanwhile everyone I ever played with in cata loved those early cata dungeons). So yeah sure I don‚Äôt sit in trade looking for a tank, but the trade off is easier dungeons.
---
i love the gameplay of rogue throughout cata-wod, but im very concern of gearing up my rogue.. specially as there will be competition in gear. Do you know any gold farming spot like how hunter have mara, to get me started as fresh lv 60 rogue who wants to level up engi and poison/thistle tea.
---
Thanks for the input my man. Really appreciate intelligent responses like this, I‚Äôm a BC baby so I have no vanilla input. Loved my Druid in BC but I know it‚Äôs a whole different world. Thanks again.
---
If they add new content and new gear they are going to have to turn classes. Hunters will be that far behind  fury warriors they will be unusable in raids, same goes for any of the low scaling classes. 
---
All they need is some number tweaks, it wouldn‚Äôt be a hard exercise. I‚Äôm not suggesting they go and give hunters kill shot and a 10 button rotation, just let them scale better with gear. Same with reducing mana cost of some damage spells for hybrids, making less bosses immune to fire damage so those specs are playable etc.
---
Maybe you can take that to a stand up show, that joke is great
---
Weeks :p
---
Ashenvale was too big, too much running around IMO.
---
payo
---
Slumber sand.
---
‚Äúit's going to accomplish absolutely nothing in terms of keeping the starter area population down. ‚Äú what. A realm with 1000 in start area - with unlimited amount of layers.. can easily be turned to 1 person per start zone.. same realm. Ofc it makes a difference.
---
Would love to see what it looked like from the opponents perspective he‚Äôs probably on his asshole.
---
 INFP Mediator, Priest main
---
That was the old sharding. The layering solution has been clearly stated to possibly be in for the entirety of phase 1 if needed.
---
August is later summer. I'd wager to fucking guess that most Americans(sorry its an american game and company idgaf)understand that summer for us lies most squarely in Late may to late august. They should have clarified like so many other companies do for literally any sort of product/media under the sun "expect a release tentatively early summer 2019 or late summer, etc)
---
Thanks for the critic!
---
This is the right answer imo
---
the dude is talking about hacking, not realizing it's a bug while PLAYING A BETA and then not reporting it? really glad the streamers got in
---
Such a cesspool over there.
---
Anyone sees Asmon do anything and they make a big old rant and hate thread 
---
Nobody cares if you hate asmon people, we don‚Äôt need it posted everytime he does something
---
If you're going to publicly say "I just don't like what streamers bring to the table for games like this"
---
At least tell us all what you mean instead of not posting because you don't want the backlash of people who disagree.
---
Don't want your comments to be public? Don't comment.
---
I was guild leader for 2 years in wotlk and I would say not to do it. We were a smaller guild so we ran only 10 mans, but the planning, farming, helping gear up was so tedious. 
---
 If you aren't legit ready to sink in HOURS of wasted time, then it's not for you.
---
I think the best option is just to be a really good guild member, especially in classic wow. GMs notice these things. This will help solidify raid slots or gear. 
---
Being that one guy who is already on time, with extra food and extra pots, who farms devilsaur leather in spare time, always a win in my book.
---
too bad the dragon reset :(
---
There's always twinking anyway, which was better in Vanilla/TBC.
---
that guy that is playing undead mage, don't know his name, but he is more entertaining imho.  he also posts yt clips where he gets destroyed in pvp and is a good sport about it.   titles are  a bit clickbaity, but the content is ok.  
---
edit: Venruki   , found his name elsewhere in this topic
---
Mate don‚Äôt be worried at all. I‚Äôll let you in on a little secret - your experience will likely be more authentic then someone who has played for years. 
---
Reason being, it‚Äôs all new every step in the game world will likely have you guessing at what‚Äôs next, you‚Äôll often find yourself faced with vistas that take your breath away, at the same time they will make you feel insignificant in this massive world. 
---
You‚Äôll make friends that will last a lifetime - I have several friends from classic wow I talk to daily -You‚Äôll form rivalries with other players that ad a sense of competition and if you‚Äôre on a pvp server, a sense of danger. 
---
Most importantly you‚Äôll have just as much if not a little more fun then veterans. 
---
You‚Äôre in for a treat my friend. 
---
Ps you will still encounter jerks, but that‚Äôs true for anything really.
---
And salty p server players too
---
Not worth the chance imo, it's going to be pretty small.
---
Nope. You have to start from the beginning again.
---
Blizzard has removed more content from retail than will ever be in the game again
---

How stupid are you on a scale of 1-10?
---
PogU
---
Shitty dungeons
---
Read my comment again. It's not 1000 per server, it's 1000 per layer (well, probably more like 3000, but same point).
---
Lol do you use them to lean? That's why I got mine.
---
He was of the opinion: "let others have it, but I don't want it for myself. "
---
Paladins have special melee attacks that require weapons?
---
You have to start completely over to change.
---
You know they have the dates the beta is open on their site right? So you don't have to check and give yourself disappointment. 
---
Me? I'm currently forgetting what month it is so I don't have to count days.
---
I was in the same situation working shift work during legion but at least with that expac I had success pugging raids and mythics. Didn't feel that bad to be a solo person in that expansion.
---
even TBC was nerfed in many places. bosses are soloable now instead of group content. quests streamlined.
---

Lf raid spot as Unholy Priest

Raid nights preferably during the week

Previously raided as main tank from Cata through to Wod including mythic content

New to vanilla raid content

Will be very active as I plan on pvping, raiding and gold farming

nah im going to play classic, and it will be easy, and it will be dead within 2 months of phase 6 being released. and mindless exploration of a game we already explored. 10/10.
---
it is capped at level 30 and it took them 1 week to exhaust everything. you cata babies have no idea how rose-tinted your glasses are.
---
I dont wanna break off from the point, as I DESPERATELY want them to change their mind on AV in Classic. But, on Retail I recently had a game a week ago that had both Lokholar and Ivus summoned, it was glorious.
---
Awesome! Didn't have a reason to buy the wallpaper engine until now. Thanks for all the effort!
---
Are you really asking this on Reddit?
---
Pretty sure I saw a dead body in the back ground of an r/aww pic the other day /s
---
If the blizzard salary rumors are true, I'm sure the money they put into classic already got paid off by the subscription baiting classic beta invites. Thanks to those streamers that will probably make some servers unplayable. I like some of the streaming content but I'm making absolutely sure I'm not on the same server as one of the big ones. Fuck that. Also,  15$ isn't that much now compared to when the game first came out but I think it's ridiculous they want people to pay 15$/month for a game that came out more than a decade ago and doesn't have any new content updates.  I don't know how they would do it but it should be cheaper, 5$-10$ to play classic and then you upgrade the subscription to BFA.  If they unfucked the current game I would upgrade and play, but they haven't, so I wouldn't upgrade.  There's like some pretty cool content with the current game I haven't seen or done but the fundamentals of the game are so whacked right now.
---
Played a melee Hunter without a Pet. I couldn't be bothered with finding food to feed it. Not to mention I was around level 45 when I realized they had skills you could train them in.
---
It was fixed in Vanilla too.
---
Drop the manual on the table "Are you aware of Elune's light?"
---
This statement is so wrong it hurts. The best ret pally in the world won‚Äôt come close to a fury warrior watching pornhub while he kills the boss. The best shadow priest is almost impossible to get near a mage because he‚Äôs going to be using his wand for half the fight. 
---
End game in vanilla is actually such a big step down from retail people are going to be shocked how monotonous it is. Play a mage? Cast only frostbolt the entire fight. Thinking that the fun in classic wow comes from how balanced the end game is is just plain wrong. The only reason it didn‚Äôt get changed in vanilla is because they ran out of time.
---
This isn't my Dark Souls Lite private server! REEEEE
---
This is such a good idea too. Real bummer about the paywall
---
I'm starting to feel like OP just made this super inaccurate on purpose and is correcting it as people send him more info.
---
Anyone who subs only for a chance at beta is just fooling themselves.
---
The odds are really, really small.
---
Ok, so it's been a long time, but back in 2005, my then girlfriend (now wife) and I were (and still are) playing as two Nelf druids. We had just ventured into Stonetalon for the first time, and we were in the area where the logging operation is going on. We see these two horde come running right towards us, and we freak out...go cat form and try to get out of there as fast as we can.
---
The two hordies are also both druids and go travel form (I don't think we even knew what travel form was yet) and they run in front of us, /sit, and /dance. (Did travel form have a dance yet in classic?? They may have switched back to cat form). We /danced too.
---
After a minute or so of that, they /waved and ran off. It was one of those totally random and totally human moments that make an MMO worth playing.
---
That was the moment we really fell in love with wow.
---
Barber Shop is interesting. On the stress test I accidentally gave my preplanned toon earrings I did not want, didn't notice until hours later. That would suck if this was real launch. But obviously a barber shop is SUPER not Classic. Maybe we will get the 15$ option so I can remove earrings I accidentally leave on
---
Oh my god I read it as "hours per day" I am so fucking stupid
---
I got rig 500‚Äôs they are cheap, around 100 Australian Rubles, very light and have decent sound. There are likely better ones out there but rig 500s work for me.
---
Underrated comment.
---
You're blaming streamers here when Blizzard has already stated that they are putting all of their current efforts into fixing gameplay bugs and things that are purely a very minor aesthetic such as this bug are far from a priority.
---
Once the important stuff is fixed they may or may not look into this kind of stuff. Honestly though, even on the list of minor aesthetic bugs in the Classic Beta this one is probably at the bottom of the list.
---
Speak for yourself, I already know I'm a vending machine. That is my destiny , to hydrate my homies.
---
i remember my last gm ninjad hand of justice but i had to roll with it because it seemed like nobody else cared but me, i won the roll though so i was more invested i guess. took me ages to get it after that.
---
Check out r/headphoneadvice they have a topics about headphone and headsets for gaming.
---
Check out classicwow.live. lots of good content for learning more about Vanilla WoW.
---
I played a hunter until wrath and lost interest in the game all together. Can't wait for classic!
---
Right, I meant from the get go
---
They said summer and probably hoped early, but saying ‚Äúcoming early summer‚Äù and then delaying it would be a bigger clusterfuck than what is happening now. I‚Äôm an American and have zero problem with how they did it and how they did it was plenty sensible and in line with common corporate practices. The outrage over this issue wouldn‚Äôt have happened 5+ years ago, internet outrage is just so trendy :\
---

---
Those are good if you aren't looking for a headset/mic combo
---
Tons of the data is stored server side, that's why private servers have never really been able to 100% replicate classic WoW.
---
Shaman fav. Leveled as enhancement, then around 55 respeced resto/elem. Healed dungeons and was a top dps in raids.
---
Never got Palys. Except for their bubble and mount they seemed really unappealing
---
He's so cute! I love labradors
---
Just don‚Äôt play on their server. People going for the world firsts back in the day were pretty much as prepared as some of these streamers are, and if you yourself aren‚Äôt going for world firsts you probably won‚Äôt notice unless your trying to notice
---
Preach is a hardcore raider. Hardcore raiding Is the one aspect of the game that you can look at in 2004/05 and in 2019 and say ‚Äúyeah 100% it‚Äôs better now‚Äù.
---
Vanilla is a step in the right direction for every other aspect of the game. 
---
But if your daily experience with wow is mythic raiding, you look at classic and ask...why?
---
Mythic raiders have guilds with communities already. They‚Äôre the only people on retail not missing the community aspect. They don‚Äôt have to pre raid farm on retail and the content is much more mechanically engrossing on live.
---
All that said, that‚Äôs probably why he said he will raid log retail and play classic otherwise. 
---
Classic with modern raid difficulty is possibly the best mmo ever (not) made.
---
Take my money and use it to make WoW 2 please :)
---
My vanilla guild didn't do RMT but we held a weekly competition during Naxx prog where the person that donated the most consumables won a carry through BWL and got all gear they could equip. 
---
Top end guilds will do this to flask/pot up their raiders so they can raid instead of all farming.
---
No beta code, huh?
---
Sorry to hear that man. Will do
---
Expected atleast one paladin Wallpaper, FeelsBadMan :(
---
Some of the quest items respawn in 10-20 seconds. It's not too bad.
---
Plus, they'll be using layering to have multiple versions of the world. So hopefully starter zones won't be overloaded.
---
Fun fact for those who dont know. If you die on a boat, dont release, you'll be rezzed when the boat teleports. I should of tested that during the stress test though to see if that's true for Classic...
---
\*generic comment about blizzard being bad\* upvotes to the left, plx
---
Mop cata wrath sc2 bc hearthstone overwatch 
---
D3 isn‚Äôt an mmo, there‚Äôs nothing mmo about it beyond being online. That‚Äôs akin to calling csgo an mmo fps.
---
I have been building my own PC since I was like 13 (over 16 years now), I am not new to PCs at all. I just couldn't remember if WoW had gamepad support or not, as I do not have anything USB to plug in and test it. Obviously there are tons of third party apps that work, not what I was asking though.
---
I am familiar with joy2key, thank you for the info regardless though.
---
I was watching StaySafe almost exclusively but then one night someone said he's a well known misogynist and its been bothering me ever since. I don't know if it was a joke or not but I can't shake it. Anyone have insight in that?
---
Now I've been watching Esfand instead because he's always genuinely nice.
---
As far as YouTube goes, madseasonshow videos were my nighttime ritual before the  beta started. Love his top 10 Vanilla videos.
---
They still have unlimited layers.. they can adapt.. 2000-3000 per layer - 6 start zones evenly divided- 500 per start zone.. still adaptable.. what
---
A broken leg is more expensive to repair than a new horse, why they get put down
---
I'm only in favor of this if we remove the automod's text limit. Sometimes I just want to ask a simple question that doesn't require a full paragraph of explanation
---
I bet you wish they‚Äôd put dungeon finder into classic
---
Thx for the hint!
---
I‚Äôm not sure about that, but just bringing it up since it would be useless for other melee classes.
---
You are married to a 2-year old??!
---
That doesn't sound legal where I'm from ;)
---
Druid is my main, and would probably say Priest is my least favorite.
---
Amazing list, though a ton of this wont be achievable in a single day realistically, this is still fantastic
---
I agree on a game-play perspective. When they killed skill-trees I was out.
---
But from a graphics-standpoint? I'm sure I'll enjoy the nostalgia at first, but I wouldnt mind them introducing the retail models eventually.
---
Agreed.
---
Spells scale with spell power.
---
Attacks scale with attack power.
---
Paladins don't have attacks.
---
We have spells.
---
So paladins scale with Spell Power.
---
Cause we cast spells.
---
Paladins in Spell gear = Big D Deeps.
---
Taking the payment off your subscription completely nullifies your question.
---
Mention it when you join a dungeon, you are new to classic, you don‚Äòt know all the stuff. Majority won‚Äòt hate you for it üôÉ
---
more than
---
meaning 
---
they scale with SP
---
and don't scale at all with AP
---
Can't bug report when you gotta make content!
---
Jesus we couldn't wait until launch week for all the "Eat carrots and drink kale juice instead of monster, dont forget to sleep sweety" posts like every other damn release?
---
And I can‚Äôt fucking wait
---
Cata was only ok cause it was the biggest drop off in wow history lmao. Wotlk was barely passable. Hearthstone, overwatch and SC2 OMEGALUL. D3 is much more mmo like than these games, you could join anybody at any time and it had a global auction house. It was pretty mmo-like lol. MOP is the only successful launch blizzard has ever done tbh.
---
PROPER headphone recommendations require lots of proper research.
---
Don't ask here though. And don't get a headset.
---
The popular answer for your range is maybe the ATH m50x's though. Good entry level cans that are relatively "flat" for someone who doesn't have much experience in that way of headphones.
---
For that budget you can buy better and more specialized cans, but those are always the safe bet for all types. They ARE overhyped though.
---
Dumb short sighted people applauded those changes.  Anyone with a shred of foresight immediately saw how LFD destroyed WoW.
---
My friends got me a bottle for my 30th birthday, so good!
---
Oh man, such a bummer, seems like another way out is to roll a bank alt to spec into goblin engineering to craft all those bombs
---
Every week I watch this beta my memory is completely fucked with. My brain can't comprehend watching level 30s hit and kill a 62, I just don't remember it working like that.
---
Implying beta testing is before alpha, implying world first wasnt in original classic, implying world first is achieved on a beta...wtf is this shit.
---
how many more times will this be posted before the launch in 3 months?
---
If you're starting off fresh, as in you don't have a core group of capable raiders, you need to manage the guilds expectations and yours. Don't expect to attract a lot of experienced people right away, as they tend to pick established guilds or people with a comparable amount of experience, or jump into raiding by one shoting bosses. Social/casual will be easier to start up. Keeping the guild lively with activity like 5 man's and PvP will help develop a community. And as a casual guild, get rid of bad apples as it will sap morale. Judge how the guild is progressing and then you can jump into raiding when you're ready. It's temping to go in right away but you don't want to start if you have no chance because that stops being fun. Also expect a lot of turnover at the start. 
---
It's a lot of work to guild lead and raid lead so be sure to delegate duties to members who have the right attitude for the environment you're going for. Co-leads, Officers, and class leads, will make raiding more enjoyable for everyone, especially yourself.
---
Well if the target is a certain level, never hurting your target is worse than just white his from this pole so depending on your target this is BiS for any class that can weird it.

I use Corsair's VOID Pro's and really like them.
---
https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Gaming-Headsets/Wireless-Headsets/void-pro-wireless-config-na/p/CA-9011152-NA
---
Wireless (charge cable, no batteries) is nice as long as you're okay with a *very* tiny amount of audio lag.  Less than what matters in a game like WoW, IMO.  Aside from that they are super comfortable, the charge last hours for massive binge sessions, and the range on them is pretty great.  I can walk to the other side of my house without breaking the connection.
---
"Take him to church"
---
Fucking died laughing
---
This 100x. I could never really place the real reason why I keep coming back to classic after so many years, but it is truly as Preach says: we create new stories ourselves, and that is a timeless experience.
---
I suppose that‚Äôs true, I guess I was more focused on its practical use in the actual game than in the beta with the current level cap, haha.
---
Idk if virgin if valky was his gal
---
Looks like hunter it is!
---
Well.. How can i avoid university tho?
---
Lol look at all the butthurt fanboys who got triggered by that comment.
---
Oh, well the original post only states the accuracy scaled- not the damage. So outside of low level range it's a absolute shit weapon hah
---
Thank you so much for the Darkshire one! I absolutely love Duskwood, throwing the music in was a great touch.
---
Way to go gettin the name Pete
---
It's not really surprising that people who make money by playing games are playing a popular game.
---
Preach has done a complete 180 on classic. I did as well when I played Nostalrius. I quit WoW after cata because I just didn't find it fun anymore. I though maybe it's game or maybe it's me. Maybe what I find fun in an mmorpg has changed. Nostalrius was the best mmorpg experience I had in years, probably since burning crusade. That server confirmed that I didn't change but WoW changed ever so slowly over the years. Retail is hot garbage for an mmorpg. It's a good video game but not a good mmo.
---
Good little elemental fire farming spot there in the charred vale, helped pay for my mount.
---
I've been running these on my ultrawide for a while now (thanks for sending me some of the source files a bit ago btw!) and while they are a little zoomed in, they don't look bad at all!
---
Druid all the way. My actual excitement lies with the dream of a TBC "classic server" when feral tank was relevant for all content.
---
I feel like there are two aspects to being new...
---
 1) new when it comes to mechanics. After a few days played time, this evolves pretty quickly. You start with such few skills and level relatively slow so that when you level you‚Äôll learn the benefits of new skills progressively. You‚Äôll make mistakes in groups, but the learning curve is pretty quick.
---
2) new when it comes to content. There will be A LOT of people in this boat. People won‚Äôt know where to go for quests and people won‚Äôt know boss mechanics. You‚Äôll certainly not be alone here so I wouldn‚Äôt be concerned about this.
---
As a warrior I didn't put 5 talents points into cruelty (5% crit increase) because I only had a 5% crit chance by base and by my calculations increasing that by 5% would only give me an additional 0.25% crit chance.
---
Omg I forgot about crendor... deadlyslob... ryutauro.., crazy thinking back to the wow Youtubers I used to watch
---
Shit I did not know that. ZG was a masterpiece. 
---
I understand why they had to nerf leveling one the majority of the game started to take place past 60. But why did they have to go out of their way to rip apart so many awesome dungeons and raids. They gave everyone in-game dungeon maps and boss guides anyway, who cares if some Vanilla dungeons are a bit of a maze.
---
You have a 0.0000001% chance to get in if you sub. They have said they are practically done with invites. Use the search bar next time. This question is asked every 10 minutes.
---
i've played druid alot in mop, i fuckin love shape shifting but i very much enjoyed being in feral form and just deal dmg.. i've watch alot of druid dmg spec videos and from what i gather, they just use feral as opener and never go back..
---
open with feral &gt; bear to cc &gt; casterform to dmg.. 
---
sad part is, i think their only using 1-2 for skill dmg lol..
---
with ur build, does that make it optimal to be a dedicated feral dmg dealer spec? while ofc changing forms such as bear for tanking some dmg and cc, caster form for cc and heal?
---
Everything pre-Cata &gt; Everything post-Cata
---
Hopefully this will get a blue post
---
The first 30 or so levels on a rogue is also kinda rough. Rogues have decent gold gains with pickpocket strat, or just farming elites in Tut's Hand. 
---
Hunters are by far more forgiving and easy to get into - but they also have a very high skillcap. There's a lot of interesting beast macro you can do, same as traps. 
---
There's a lot of hunters, not a lot of great ones. But the meh ones still perform well due to pet.
---
Well fuck me, sorry I took ten seconds out of your day
---
I remember this monstrosity.. My very first day on wow, that dragon split my cheeks. He was kited to sw somehow and it took ages to kill him because of the noobs.
---
The f2p mmos are garbage.  People didn't quit WoW to go play the free version of Lotro or whatever other crap MMO was out.  
---
Blizzard got greedy and tried to expand their playerbase by appealing to people who played candy crush on their phone.  I don't blame them in a sense, its a massive untapped market for them.  Problem is those players arent MMORPG players, theyre fotm players.  Blizzard attempted to appease  the "true gamers" by keeping difficult raid modes, but ultimately they just reached too far and tried to appeal to too many different type of players and ended up making a game that appeals to no one.
---
&gt; Prep your PC.
---
I'm just going to go out there and say it, back up all your data such as music, movies, and documents to a USB hard drive. Then back up very important documents to the cloud somewhere, maybe a Google Drive.
---
From there, it doesn't hurt to just do a fresh install of Windows. Most computers I fix are in bad shape and honestly the easiest way to fix them of all of the bloatware they've installed is to start fresh. Keep your data on the USB drive and installed programs only on the main drive. It makes this process so much easier.
---
Definitely not. I can get my classic fix on a pserver while I wait!
---
The danger is part of it but more broadly, it's "scarcity". Scarcity of info, XP, damage, health, oh shits, consumables,  gear,  bag space, etc, etc, etc, etc. Scarcity creates suffering and enduring through periods of suffering creates happiness.
---
How do we humans successfully endure suffering? We do it together. 
---
P.S. You finally get it. Welcome to the family.
---
I LOVE world PvP here. The sloped, tight terrain makes for a really good battleground.
---
Jeeze, the amount of people who glorify the person are as bad as pewdiepie fans.  I watch various content creators as well, but never have to have multiple posts everytime the person so much as farts on stream.
---
I lol'ed
---
Will definitely consider. Thank you fr taking the time to type this up
---
You got me good on that one man. Hook, line, and sinker
---
I... enjoyed them. They were fucking rough when they came out. Like no they weren't as good as their original raid forms, but for cata dungeons they were pretty good and hard.
---

Yeah. As a Paladin I could almost always run away from several mobs and survive. I hate losing more than I love winning.
---
I expect nothing less than from a Jizzbo.
---
Hey! Im a long time mmo player, but never quite got into the wow scene. I am on Us servers, and will be rolling Alliance as a rogue. I want to do PvE, and raiding, but may try out PvP to test it. Looking for a group og mature people who just like to game, but have goals they want to achieve in the process. Pm me please!
---
he never said they‚Äôre bad dude. read the comment again. why are you trying so hard to defend those guys, you think they‚Äôll give you an invite to their guild or something? relax with the streamer popularity cults.
---
I use the hyperx cloud II on amazon for like $90, seem great for the price, durable, lightweight, mic sounds really good.
---
I love vanilla wow but
---
man Why the fuck does the debuff duration on the target NOT COUNT DOWN?? Hammer of Justice icon just stays there...you have no way of knowing how long it is till it ends.
---
also... no cast times on target???
---
The game is impossible if you play without some third party UI.
---
I *loved* that area, maybe not for the enemies but it was just so different from any other area that it really stood out. Another area I enjoyed for the same reason was the Searing Gorge.
---
Read the last part of your sentence and see how that can be applied to the opposite side of the spectrum, "we don't need it posted everytime he does something." I don't need to see 3+ posts about this person every time he so much as breathes.
---
You know those annoying people who won't shut up about how great their baby/kid is and go on and on about them. That's how you people are with him. Who cares! Plent of bosses have been dragged to cities in the games life. I was more impressed with the carnage the Baron bomb or Hazzak corrupted blood did back in the day.
---
Is there anything consumable that you need Gnomish engineering to produce or anything that requires specifically Gnomish engineering to keep using, or could you just make all of the gnomish stuff and then respec for bombs?
---
Can‚Äôt blame people for asking for what they want. Doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll get it. Was vanilla my favorite point in WoW? No. Is it more fun than retail? Yes. So will I play classic while being annoyed by no guild banks or dual spec option? Yep. Is classic for me? Most definitely.
---
This seems too good to be true. What‚Äôs the catch?
---
He was, he said in this exact video that he was skeptical about classic being a game for him
---
Yeah that seems about right given your inputs.
---
I'm leveling a priest at normal speed (some things will go fast for me but overall thought I should go for normal) at an average of 40hrs a week and I should hit 60 near the end of October. Possible I hit it early - mid October. Minimum 5 weeks of real time though for sure, for me anyway.
---
Yeah but if you make items that only goblin engineers can use, you're still in the same situation.
---
I doubt they will, it was quite common for people to kite a specific mob from blasted lands to bolvar, at 1% they would become invulnerable, which was great for leveling weaponskills but would prevent quests involving him to function (mainly the onyxia chain)
---
Imagine unironically using the imagine meme
---
I don't care about backlash from reddit posters. My post got down voted as is and I haven't deleted it. I stand by what I said. If you have a problem with it, move along then.
---
Look at how mad his fanboys get when your not ecstatic over every little thing he does and summon their friends to down vote you. Bad as pewdiepie cult.
---
##**&lt;TRADE CHAT&gt; - Horde - NA EST - PvP**
---
#Intro
---
We are &lt;TRADE CHAT&gt;. Our mission is to outnumber, overwhelm, and dominate our opponents in PvP content. Our soul purpose is to be feared by the opposing faction. As a guild master from Wrath of the Lich King I have personally lead a 230+ man raid of guildmates on Eastern Kingdom on my Discipline Priest. Join The Dark Army as we plan our march again!
---
#Goals
---
We will complete PvE content weekly in order to achieve BiS gear. Teams will be created with schedules to practice battleground content with a heavy focus on Warsong Gulch. Events will be held weekly to participate in massive world PvP warfare.
---
#Rules
---
There are no rules in love and war(craft)... Although when doing PvP events, players will be expected to follow orders from higher ranking members to maintain order. Players will be expected to show up on raid night 15 minutes early and maintain 85% attendance. Other than that, just be mature and have fun.
---
#Raid Times
---
As of right now there are no set raid times. When we have more core members, we will all discuss and agree on raid times. Ideally we will have at least 2 nights per week for raiding.
---
#Recruitment
---
* Officers
---
* PvP leaders
---
* Raid leaders
---
* Raiders
---
* Members
---
* Recruits
---
***We need raid leaders and people that love to PvP. Or people that have no experience PvPing but are interested in doing a lot of it when Classic WoW releases. If you have experience leading raids in world PvP/PvE or want to give it a serious shot, let us know. All members will be expected to maintain a certain level of maturity but age is not necessarily a restriction.***
---
#About Me
---
*I am 29 years old and I started playing shortly before the launch of The Burning Crusade. By the time I reached 60 TBC had launched so I missed all of the vanilla raiding content. I played casually up until Wrath of the Lich King where I started to play a little more seriously after finally acheving max level while max level content was still current. I lead a guild on my server which casually peaked at around 50 players online per day. This time around, I'd like to lead a more focused group of people to accomplish end game content.*
---
#GUILD EVENTS
---
1. Marathon March Madness
---
    * One giant army will zerg from one side of EK to the other side, killing everything in sight.
---
    * Kill on sight.
---
2. Eastern Kingdom Takeover
---
    * Teams will be strategically placed around Ally major cities.
---
    * On the raid leader's command, all major cities will be hit at the same time.
---
    * Kill on command.
---
3. All Aboard 
---
    * Teams will camp zeppelin's and boats preventing all continental travel.
---
    * Kill on sight, but DO NOT leave group.
---
4. Lowbie Annihilation Day
---
    * High level players will escort lowbies in large groups to engage in world PvP.
---
*If you want to join and have any idea for guild events please let us know!*
---
#How to join
---
**Feel free to jump in be the Discord server and leave a message in the recruit channel, https://discord.gg/k7Y4k6Z**
---
No problem. The game is slow enough that you should be able to figure out how to play your class over time. Try to spend time doing things that aren't just leveling, like PVP and dueling, as this will help round out your skill set and understanding of your class.
---
Luckily, nothing in Vanilla is hard enough that you should be completely blocked by lack of knowledge. A few youtube videos make any encounter doable. You will make mistakes here and there but if you do your best there's no reason you'll get left behind.
---
ENTJ-A - what does this mean?
---
I'd pay. Wouldn't care what people thought or said either. See, randoms don't pay my Bill's, or work my shifts, or feed and clothe my daughter, so it's a pretty safe bet that I can spend my money how I want.
---
That‚Äôs true
---
Man, thats so encouraging, I think i needed to \*hear\* this, i\`m even more excited to explore this massive world, thanks a lot, appreciate the help!
---
Schhhhh
---
Let the Ret dream die, it's a literal dog tier DPS spec
---
Preach is my favourite, i see a lot of love for madseason and ehhhh idk his videos about "the top 10 x in classic compared to retail" are a bit too clickbait for my liking and im not a fan of the way he talks but ive been told hes aware of it so its w/e
---
All the people o3b allcast and classic cast sans the guests are just a big old bag of yikes from me
---
Same. Blizzard collecting a cool 45 plus tax from me till it launches.
---
Idk why, I like everything else on max EXCEPT for the water.  Looks like a pool of liquid metal or something.  It's very glossy and needs some kind of waves or something.  It's like the wind never blows.
---
Eh, I can‚Äôt really argue against *feels*. But you won‚Äôt really need to be full on tank while leveling, and the faster your group nukes, the more efficient you become. No need to really go sword and board.
---
This made me think of a new system that allows people with good marks to roll against someone that the loot council designated as the reciever
---
So go play retail
---
Running dungeons is my absolute favorite thing Todo even above raiding.  I'd love to heal raids and bear tank dungeons for guildies.
---
Pfftt... could always use another couple of monitors and a gamer throne.
---
A legend? What has the guy done that hasn't been done countless times before? People used to kite Kazarak and the Green Dragon's to Stormwind back in the day. Bringing the Baron bomb from MC and Hazzak cursed blood back to cities and having people die for hours was legend back in the day. This is just rereading old ground.
---
I appreciate this
---
It just goes to show you that the players don't always know what they want. It's been a thing for a while, and the result is the retail WoW that we currently have.
---
I don't watch streams at all but everything I heard about asmongold was very negative.
---
In reality he seems like a really pleasant and fun guy from what I've seen of the clips posted here. Kinda funny how you unknowingly get a distorted image of someone and treat it as truth.
---
Oooh, awesome. How do we find out which spell is which ID though?
---
You're not getting in just because you sub
---
That's no issue mate, but these subs get flooded with the same question everyday. It's common courtesy to try and solve a question first before asking others to solve it. But we're all hyped for Classic here so it's all fine.
---
Buffs always generated threat in real vanilla. If your priest cast fort after the pull the mobs immediately switched to them. If they cast renew on you and it didn't heal at all, just the application of the Buff caused the mobs to switch.
---
So you'd use battle shout to get them to come back to you while they were en route.
---
DONT CENDOR YOUR WHELP PETS IF THEY DROP!
---
That's actually a pretty interesting point. These people are living the dream of community in beta.
---
Cause it sucked
---
I did the same thing lol
---
I hope we see more beast mastery hunters.  Beastial wrath rocks!
---
So you're telling me theres a chance?
---
Wow, really? Im a legionbaby and even i got stress test. Tho i got baited into buying 6 months sub with boat, maybe that's why.
---
I stopped playing with Cata. Have a wife and toddler since. Classic will run smoother than butter on a 2 year old laptop. I‚Äôm looking forward to the integration too! Cheers!
---
Rhakzor is a boss, not just an elite. I am not saying the numbers don't sound off to me but comparing a 19 elite boss to a 26 elite non boss isn't fair math, no? Maybe I am wrong here
---
Your right, but it is also great advice for real life
---
The only way anyone can beat this guy in a 1v1.
---
Go wireless. 
---
SteelSeries Arctis 7. 
---
Logitech g933
---
probably still will. when classic is dead 2 months after phase 6 you will be too.
---
Only brought for the shadow rebuff if they have enough destruction locks
---
Yes, there's a chance :)
---
I have a day off requested for the following monday so I have a long weekend to play
---
Just watched his whole Vanilla Flavors videos about classes tonight. Holy shit were they entertaining, short, and well informed. Definitely subbing and watching all his stuff.
---
I‚Äôve always leveled my hpally as heals. It‚Äôs always the first character to get leveled every expansion so whenever I go through on my other characters I don‚Äôt find it as tedious/annoying. At least hpallys have more spells to actually level with these days.
---
A small chance at Classic is better than definitely playing BFA
---
I think this is actually something that is a bigger problem in people‚Äôs heads than it will be in reality. I keep seeing a ton of threads about people who started past Lich King so they‚Äôre all in the same boat as you. Honestly it won‚Äôt be a problem. Just have fun and explore at your own pace.. enjoy the journey and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
That's some extremely helpful info my friend I really appreciate it. Hunters seem to have allot more outplay potential if played well. Which wont be me for a long time but I can practice.lol what talents would you suggest taking?
---
Shoot the mobs, bloodrage while they run to you (rage generation gives threat), battle shout (also gives threat, though apparently only on initial application in beta) then that should be enough for them to stick on you through the first heal/wave  of their attacks which should give you a revenge proc and enough to start doing whatever.
---
At 60 yes you don't use heroic strike a lot and if you have shield slam you don't really use it at all except to avoid rage cap.
---
While leveling its really good though. Since the mob will most likely be dead by the time you get to 3 sunders it's more time efficient to just do more damage for your group while still holding aggro.
---
Its not as rage inefficient as you think since a lot of your white attacks miss anyways in dungeons where the mobs are higher than you, so that white attack you think you're missing out on to generate more rage actually had a pretty low chance to even happen with miss chance/dodge/parry/etc. Most of your rage is gonna come from the damage you take in low level dungeons, not the damage you deal.
---
Mate, I‚Äôm not blindly supporting people because they are streaming. 
---
Many people, including this guy (read his comment history if you wish) are just negative about everyone and their abilities, regardless. 
---
It‚Äôs horrible and toxic and im sick of this bullshit.
---
If you want to judge someone, judge them on the merits of their play, not your insecurities as a player or human.
---
Dank. Ty
---
I'm subbed to Classic and a flight Sim sub. This was extremely confusing.
---
WoW classic is such a massive time sink, I can see it breaking up small guilds because of that one person that wants to play the old game again.
---
Definitely not vanilla. No one would give you 100g in vanilla begging
---
the problem wasn't that the changes were unpopular. It's that they had unintended consequences that were very unpopular.
---
Ditto ^
---
Yeah they need to start a phase tbc for after all the classic content.
---
Reaper of souls was the smoothest launch of any blizzi game. BFA wasn't as bad as wod and legion was smooth.
---
Nice, 53.
---
yea, up until about half way through BC pallies were pulling threat based on spellpower making the Shockwave truncheon one of the best 1h maces for pally tanks. It was also a top item for priests and mages and shamans I believe which from a single boss drop at the end of a heroic dungeon meant that your odds of getting one as a pally tank were slim to none. I finally got mine about 2 weeks before the change to normalizing tank threat off of str.

Skipping Desolace? :O Such a good leveling spot!
---
Don't worry, I started playing vanilla wow 15 years ago, I haven't played it for so many years and I'm like a newbie right now, there will be a lot of players like me and a lot of new comers like you, the hardcore players are maybe 3-5% of the player base. I'm not gonna rush to level 60, I want to enjoy and re-experience it.

I remember legion launch being pretty rough but I agree with everything else. Diablo 3 had already significantly declined before reaper of souls.
---
ENFP-A, Mage, PVP, Horde
---
I'd say despite the 19 being a boss, the higher level elites are not properly scaling their damage up and I'd say at best are doing ~half their supposed damage.
---
On the last example of the mob in decolace... if I remember right I thought there were groups of mobs in descolace that were super easy but moved in packs perhaps you found one of those off by themself? Not sure I don‚Äôt have the beta to check myself but yes from the streams I‚Äôve watched dmg does seem low... if this continues dw tanking will for sure be a thing lol

Bar women from your guild, they will destroy it with drama.

How do you get it through the elevator or did you took the long way?

How did you get Dpsmate to work? I kept getting error messages.

There are also people having more fun in BFA than they are on/with the beta. Don't use a fallacy like this to farm karma.
---
yikes

cause pallies with reckoning could infinity proc these as well. They didn't call it the Reckbomb for nothing.
---
What do you mean?
---
Don't gatekeep, everyone can learn
---
Hey guys this is a video that my raid leader from a certain server that shall not be named put together.  As a day 1 retail vanilla wow player myself I can confirm that some of the damage values on the beta feel very low.
---
I would say the 19 is doing correct damage, as lower level elites just don't hit very hard.
---
But elites quickly start to ramp up their damage FAST, especially come the mid 20's and into SM.
---
Let me try to dig up a video from vanilla era of someone doing an SM run... there is surely one around on the interwebz.
---
I see, thanks for the informative reply :)
---
Can we not have 5 posts every time he streams?
---
I subbed a day after the Beta dropped and was lucky enough to get into the Stress test but as excited I am as you, it's not worth it the stress test. Not missing out much.
---
They do, but not until level 40. Beta is capped at 30 so no one has them.
---
"use strategy" spam auto attack
---
The thing that has everyone‚Äôs attention is that the max level being 30 creates a whole new kind of meta that hasn‚Äôt been deeply explored before.
---
All, or most, of the people playing the beta have played vanilla before or have a general idea of what goes on at level 60. But capping it at 30 and seeing just how far you can push it with BIS gear, elixirs, potions, spells ect seems to have people more excited than anything Blizzard has released in wow in quite a few years.
---
Wrath of the Lich King was the last great time I had. I played through Cata which had its good points and some decent gameplay improvements.
---
But they changed so much at Cata that we crave our old world again.
---
Oh man, I know it seems like everybody will know everything, and certainly there will be more general and specific knowledge this time around than before, but as with anything, the hardcore audience is never the entirety of the audience. There will be plenty of new players interested in trying Classic just like you and tons of people who think they remember things from over a decade ago far better than they actually do.
---
As others have said, you will always have a chance to encounter those who would try to put you down for messing something up or not knowing something they think is obvious, but there's going to be so many people who will be happy to help you if you're happy to ask. 
---
Some of us still remember being that noob once!
---
My statement was not something I came up with, it is a common consensus that hunters have the highest skill ceiling. You very obviously are butthurt about this for some reason, I don't understand why because no matter what, WoW is a very casual game. The FACT that hunters have the highest skill cap also does not necessarily correlate with hunters being the best players, which is how you seem to be interpreting it (even though these are two completely different things) and this is causing you to become flustered.
---
&gt;Hunters only offer a single role
---
What? You really don't seem to know much about the game actually.
---
Just stop replying to me.
---
You should throw a point into CoE!
---
fun is still fun. i‚Äôd pay
---
What is max level gonna be in full retail classic wow?
---
On the road from deathknell to Brill, before undercity. There is a tailoring trainer and an enchanting trainer. I'm totally hitting them up after level 6 when I'm done in deathknell, or potentially earlier than level 6 if deathknell is packed because of launch
---
Hi, /u/Bonkers2544
---
&gt;actually complaining about getting banned due to griefing
---
LOL
---
You cant on some illegitimate servers. Good to see this is back.
---
Armor has an effective cap against mobs I thought?
---
So for example if you had infinite armor you still would take the same amount as a level 30 for example was my thought. Maybe not to that extreme but along those lines.
---
Also got kicked from my first dungeon run for ninja-ing a chest. It was in the Deadmines.

---
I'm in the same boat. I stopped a few months after TBC came out and haven't played since. I remember the names of dungeons and a boss or two but almost nothing else as far as strategies go. I'm excited to relearn the game and explore Azeroth again at my own pace, take in the sights and sounds, get lost in forest, wander around IF, meet other players and if I'm lucky get back to Rag and kick his firey ass again.
---
We got a depressed mage here
---
I used to play on American servers as an Aussie, 350-450 ms. This kind of stuff happened all the time at that ping at least.
---
I still think it's bullshit that they *removed* the raid versions. There was no good reason they couldn't have kept both versions in the game. 
---
At least they seem to have learned their lesson in Legion with Return to Karazhan.
---
60
---
60.
---
Rogue better overall endgame. I‚Äôm rolling one and very stoked about it.
---
So what? This is not a game meant to compete with retail, nor is it a game meant to be hardcore and push out content for that type. There is no reason in the world for them to go faster than the original in putting out content, if anything they have reason to go slower. 
---
Original timeline MC/Ony was the only raid for 9 months, then BWL for 2 months before ZG, another 4 months between that and AQ and 5 months of AQ before Naxx. No need for MC to be quite that long this time, but there is no reason to rush the others out. 
---
It will be months before most are at 60 anyway, then some time to enjoy phase 1 6 months or so for that phase seems right. A month for phase 2, then we are at phase 3. Thats 7 months of MC/ONY before BWL. At that point wait a few months for ZG, and another few after that so 6 months of BWL before AQ. Follow that with 6-8 months between AQ and Naxx and you have a good timeline. Why are you looking to rush to the end before giving people adequate time to play?
---
whys that?
---
Do you own any bose over ear headphones?
---
would appreciate if u give me some of your 2cents on why.
---
What you should *really* do is go play on a private server and see what kind of class you like, and get familiar with the basics of the game if it's new to you.
---
OP's post was useless.
---
though i know gear dont  scale with hunter compared to rogue, the reason i didnt include this is because, i feel like how much fun ill have in PvP.. it wouldnt matter to me.
---
Exactly! I may cry when I enter Iron Forge and Stormwind city... the scene and the music are just epic.
---
Hunter pros / cons outweigh rogue - and if you haven't tasted Vanilla Hunter will be easier to push through when you get frustrated.
---
How do I get this item?
---
Are you talking about for future retail expansions, or if they added on to Classic content?
---
DOA
---
I think I'll bring a white shield and white one-handed weapon with me at all times to trade to said warriors. :&gt;
---
Intentional or not it seems as though a number of things have been made easier on the classic beta. 
---
This makes me worried for classic. I hope they look into this, and a number of other things that have been noticed, or it will just be to easy. What scares me the most is that this is could have all been done intentionally to make the game more accommodating to a more casual player-base. One can only wonder what raiding will be like at this rate. 
---
I know pserver values are not accurate, as someone who has religiously played both retail vanilla and pservers. However, there is no way what I have seen thus far in the beta is. People are blowing through content MUCH easier than they should be able to. Elite mobs are looking like a joke, same with a lot of the regular mobs. In the stress test I was able to chain pull mobs 4-5 levels higher than me. 
---
Something just isn't right and I hope it is addressed.
---
Not realistic. Tanks don‚Äôt need to see the raids health bars.
---
Pugging?
---
Downvoted cuz hord scum
---
At some point you probably need some sort of reset on gear and items. Imagine getting into a game where people have 5 years of better gear than you-super scary and uninviting. An expac allows for some ‚Äúresets‚Äù within an otherwise endless game.
---
it's not even gatekeeping
---
shadow priest is for people in circlejerks, no one else gets to do it
---
No no, they don‚Äôt need to see the raid health bars as a tank.
---
Exactly. You can easily heal/tank lower dungeons out of spec as long as you have some decent gear. I feel like people who actually played vanilla should know this...
---
Prolly brush up on classic stuff, plan out my pre-raid bis blah blah.
---
The issue isn't raising the level cap.
---
The issue is raising the power of items for higher levels.
---
Yeah, right. Or maybe I've been there for every launch and legion+BFA finally wasn't a shitshow.
---
BoD is better than Uldir, yes. But have you forgotten Nighthold? That tjing had so many interesting bosses its unreal. Top it off with mythic guldan and you got an instance that is imho the best in the game so far.
---
agreed- that was criminal and a big part of why i abandoned retail
---
This isnt FFXI, I think level caps are part of the design and appeal of the expansion.
---
not this shit again. BLIZZARD HAS EXACT VALUES. it's only private server noobs that are complaining about this stuff.
---
no it wasn't.
---
That's cool to hear. I'll have to give it a watch when I'm off work and resub to see more of his classic stuff. He was my favorite wow youtuber back when I played
---
not too many, i'd wager
---
most servers are ghost towns - you just think its busy due to xrealm
---
back in wrath you'd see that many just from your own server
---
Only sold my unused armor to vendors that sold that type of gear, leather pieces to leather armor merchants and so on, because o figured they would pay more for the gear than other merchants
---
I reported it in game and took the time to show it to everyone so it is a known issue...
---
When new tires or expansions release they should just squish the previous tier and equalize it with other old content. So in retail you could lvl to 60 or 120 or whatever the cap will be, raid MC for epics that would be comparable to 5man heroic or mythic loot. Make people work for their transmogs. The only problem would be the huge itemization mess.. all would have to be reworked. And things like trinkets and thunder fury would have to be heavily reworked or removed.
---
Yup. Playing warrior
---
Come on man, use your head. Certain invites aren't random, the rest are
---
Something about the look in staysafe's eyes is just unsettling. He seemed like a funny guy but he genuinely made me feel uncomfortable lol. Idk about the misogyny or whatever but he seems like a weirdo
---
Can‚Äôt you just get the data without filter?
---
I had 200k gold on my BFA account. Figured what the hell signed up, and got in.  Account from release day, subbed until MoP. Didnt play MoP. then Played the first 2 months of WoD, Legion, BFA before stopping. So it was definitely possible, but I cant even imagine the odds ha.
---
Oh look this again.
---
They invite Select streamers (not Random) to promote
---
They randomly invite everyday players.
---
Because it‚Äôs free marketing. Yeah, it was pretty much known from the beginning for them. It makes perfect sense from a Blizzard perspective. We‚Äôll all get to play in August though!
---
So I found it hilarious that she uses her arrow keys to move as my friends mom also does that and she clicks on her abilities to cast them. You would think in those 50 days she might have considered a more sensible way to play the game.
---
Random is random. If they got specifically invited that's fine, but don't preach how its 100% random.
---
So say they stopped increasing the level cap in Wrath... 80 was it. A fresh 80 is nowhere near to even as an 80 that has grinded through all the later xpacs... Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion, and now BfA. It's all about balance. Obviously a fresh 80 would not be able to go straight to BfA as they would be severely underpowered.
---
Any class can solo instances for gold. The question is how high up can different classes get
---
Because they are not all 100% random...
---
You're right, I don't give a damn about Blizzard's competitive scene.
---
It caps at 75% damage reduction I believe in TBC/Vanilla.
---
Assuming he is at that cap, mos should be hitting for ~120 damage unmitigated.
---
A big con with increased lvl cap is also that it invalidates old content. I've always found that kind of counter productive - why not build on the game you have instead of basically remaking it to a certain extent. Tbh i think this is a big reason that many expansions has had trouble. It's probably just too much work to do that short amount of time between expansions.
---
Who preached that?
---
Add Warlock to that list. But imo Hunter is really good.
---
There is no way you're going to pull 5+ elites in Vanilla without some form of coordination/strategy/CCs, blowing everything (cooldowns, pots etc.), kiting, and what not lmao.
---
Not gonna happen
---
Its really  possible  since  they  went  to SW  1st. I used to this  and  the  max  I could  do  the  dragon  in  caverns  of time  up to OG. I cant fin the info but  there was a  guy who  kited a elite  worm  from EPL to  Booty Bay.
---
They could be using incorrect values for the specific mobs -- but still have all the original tables.
---
Far out man... We're getting classic because people bitched and moaned about the game developers fucking game.
---
It is random.
---
Except for the marketing invites. 
---
You cant be this obtuse.
---
Fuck streamers
---
he aint called fordragon cause he likes killing dragons
---
I didn‚Äôt spend any talent points until lvl 35 because my friend said it was ‚Äúreally expensive‚Äù and not to worry about it until 60. He was talking about re-specing.
---
Good place to level as Horde, you won't get ganked by anyone. But kind of a dangerous area, the harpies in vanilla are ridiculous.
---
seems not we will not have so many spriests on azeroth.
---
The problem people have with it is that you switch phases seemingly at random. In the demo, I was killing Sarkoth and suddenly he vanishes, players dissapear around me and a new Sarkoth spawns, I didn't get to see any of the players that were around me again. This happened two more times while in the Burning Blade cave. Hopefully this is unintended, seeing people and mobs dissapear and others appearing is so immersion breaking.
---
no I mean at higher levels your damage reduction should become standardized
---
oh no....the forbidden knowledge i thought forgotten i have always wanted to do this even if its just for funsies just the entire arcane archer vibe just sounds like a blast
---
Yeah but Barrens is the size of like three entire Alliance early game zones...
---
Always let the dungeon group know that you are a new player when you get invited to the group, 90% of the people are happy to teach you for sure. You will also encounter some toxic veterans who don't want to play with newbies and just want to speed run the dungeons/quests, leave the group and find a new one, no biggie! The best way is to find a group of new players and experience the content together, or find people like me who need to relearn everything even though I played it 15 years ago. :)
---
I think you're putting too much time into focusing on what other people do rather than yourself.
---
Best option for you, ignore that the streamer exists and be happy when they do something like this dragon pull as it creates a bit of conflict and change to the formula. They leave? Not many people will outright leave the game to follow a streamer, most will stick around if they enjoy the game.
---
As for streamers like Asmon, I highly doubt he would leave classic at any point unless it goes the route of bfa yet he still plays bfa, so he would still play classic as well.
---
What is griefing to you? Griefing to me is ninja looting or corpse camping for no gains but then, if you're playing classic wow the way it was meant to be played, you'll tell all your guildies and friends you're being corpse camped and ninja looters would be blacklisted/reported to the gm's.
---
You're putting too much thought into this. Streamers bring people in, of course eventually people will leave but some will stay.
---
Let's say there's 1k players. Streamer brings in like 100 people, maybe 200. Streamer leaves, 40 people stay.
---
1040 is better than 1000.

Yes. On a new server wands are in great demand. If you make greater and lesser magic wands quick enough, they will sell. to Mages priests etc. That's the only profitable early game I know about enchanting though.
---
You can do the same with bags with tailoring.
---
Just curious, for what reason?
---
Tyty see you in classic;)
---
Hunter hunter and hunter!
---
Madseason is all you need. Although Esfand is also really entertaining.

Loot whoring it up, weren't you?
---
Leveled my hunter as a blacksmith because I thought that was the only way I could make myself armor past level 40.
---
i saw streamer‚Äôs reaction videos and it is embarassing hypefest.. things like talking to other players , meeting other fellow streamers and having made friends on beta tests are hyped beyond shameless..
---
i think streamers done WoW classic a good exposure but their style of play are not what average people will do IRL.
---
im pumped and will resubscribe WoW due to Classic WoW , but i also played WOW since 2005 and i knew to temper my enthusiasm , especially knowing classic WoW have no chain quest story past lv30 and the high level zone feels incomplete..

Cant wait to visit old dungeons and get smacked by trash mobs

[OCE][A][PvP/PvE] Looking For Guild
---
‚Ä¢3 IRL friends that played back in Vanilla clearing up to K'T in Naxx (one who still playes on pservers) looking for a semi-hardcore Oceanic raiding guild to join for Classic. 
---
‚Ä¢Looking for a guild that is going to be primarily raiding on the weekends as IRL gets in the way during the weekdays.
---
‚Ä¢We will be maining Mage, Rogue and Warrior (tank or dps depending on what the guild needs) on launch.
---
Cheers!
---
I could never do my boy mad like that though
---
It's odd everyone thinks of him for vanilla content even though his videos are from TBC.
---
I know everything about classic. As do many others like me. And like me, many others are not going to try to scarf down all the content as quickly as possible. Because meeting people, making friends, and doing things with people is a part of the game experience.
---
Take your time and find the people who mess with you. With your play style. Take time to explore what your playstyle even is.
---
Friendship is Magic or some s***.
---
It's still going to be outdated as hell 12 big patches later!  I've seen the same comments but wouldn't worry about the difference too much.  You will definitely not be getting reliable information from either version when it comes to skill trees, spells, etc.
---
Very fun read though.
---
Not sure what the problem is... When the game actually releases don't play on the US realm. I dealt with this issue a lot on quite a few pservers allllll the time. Those servers are located in EU and I am in US. 
---
One of the reasons I am so looooking forward to classic. The demo and stress test was just pure magic.
---
can warlock solo farm ? i mean which talent tree ? demonology ?
---
This
---
I feel naxx level gear should be replaced maybe in heroic dungeons (if it was TBC for example)
---
Tbh tho TBC was the best they did maybe. Now adays legendaries are replaced by greens
---
Blizzard doesn't even know at this point
---
The big servers still have thousands of people on them. You‚Äôre also preaching to the choir with your whole ‚ÄúVANILLA THIS VANILLA THAT‚Äù rant.
---
Same here - I guess it depends on where people are in life, what else they have interest in playing, etc.
---
Hunter is one of the few classes that actually makes good use of spirit since they can easily keep fighting mobs without using mana
---
I've been thinking on this very topic quite a bit lately, because you're absolutely right in that so much of the end game content is relevant for such a wide amount of players, instead of every raid invalidating the previous one, which is fantastic. If you start to add more things after Naxx, they need to have items worth obtaining without having too many items worth obtaining otherwise you run the risk of over saturating the end game content or invalidating the need to run other raids. Not only that, but you need to be smart about which item slots for which classes are valuable upgrades.
---
Even if they nail this aspect, like you said, oversaturation is a potential problem. If there's eventually like 8 raids at endgame, it just becomes too taxing on even the hardcore raiders to clear it all every week.
---
I'm not sure how people would feel about a level 60 Karazhan, tuned for Classic. Personally I think it would be cool to have Deadwind Pass have real purpose in the game and Kara is a great raid, but there's work to be done in making it appropriate for Classic instead of TBC. Also makes Atiesh's portal a bit more relevant for guilds who are clearing Naxx consistently and want to add Kara to their schedule.
---
Seeing Hyjal fleshed out as a zone would be neat, designed for Classic instead of Cataclysm. Not even for any raids, although a dungeon would be cool, but just as a completed zone.
---
Overall I generally like the idea of fleshing out any parts of the original world that never got finished in Vanilla, but there's a lot to be considered there.
---
which class can farm instances solo at 5 levels higher ? which class can farm maraudon at lv 50
---
That is evil and hilarious
---
Name an appealing xpac after wrath..
---
good in 1v1, ran out of mana super fast, mana drains kill you, dispels kill you
---
It stands to reason that any new players would find the greatest capacity for fun in any version of the game.
---
Did he discover this?
---
That philosophy has been at the games core. WoW has always been an easier alternative to other mmos. It was part of its design. No the issue has been lackluster expansions. If it wasn‚Äôt we wouldn‚Äôt have seen the huge surges in legion and WoD, even though WoDs surge quickly left. Really Blizzards issue is that it‚Äôs bound to the factions and that they keep throwing shit out immediately after making it finally work. WoD had potential story wise but they just gave up before it even got off the ground. And don‚Äôt even get me started on it being a downgrade for pretty much every class.

Staysafe seemed cool on classiccast, but on his stream he is a dbag who quotes memes and talks like he's on 4chan. "Women are awful... jk" type of humor. He's playing to an audience of edgy teenagers instead of doing his own thing. Shame because he seemed cool but his solo content is unwatchable.
---
Hell I have no desire to do that LOL
---
no you lied to be controversial n quirky n funny. clearly didnt work out for you.

Look at his user name, of course he‚Äôs a tool.

It was like that for a lot of us.

asmongold released low quality content and stream , seem like he overpromote his stuff in youtube too..

I think its personal preference really. I prefer wotf because warlocks and priests are the most annoying for a mage.
---
It was ambiguous and it's blizzard so why would you assume summer ment mid summer? That's on you mate, you read to much into it.
---
If we have learned anything lately, it's that you should take Blizzards announcements with a grain of salt and patience.
---
If they found a way somehow to add new content  without either invalidating old gear or old content, that would be the perfect way to do it because then you could play both the new and the old. In most other games that works but in a game like WoW there kind of has to be constant linear progression so i think it's kind of doomed to have these sorts of content updates :p
---
__There is no god, it‚Äôs a superstition made up by stupid people, the nearest thing to a god is a set of rules that we can‚Äôt fully comprehend yet.__
---
I dont think the level cap changing is the problem 
---
Its the hard reset essentially (all new skills and talents) as well as location changes
---
All good no use arguing in here.
---
Can't the same be said about every zone for each faction in classic?
---
It just doesnt come across your mind. I played for a few months before my gf at the time that played WAY more than me saw how I played and roflstomped all over the apartment.
---
It's very likely at least a portion of the servers will move to burning Crusade content.
---
The exact amount they had as a cap in Classic.
---
Nobody said it was 100% random.
---
It's "marketing plus random"
---
haha "no pixels were harmed in the making of this game"
---
What? Your comparing a different genre and FTP to a monthly sub MMO. WoW is still the biggest MMO. FF14 sub has been saying that even with it being so hyped for Shadowbringers that it can‚Äôt hit retail WoWs numbers.
---
You bet I'm gonna have one big love release on August 27th (26th).
---
I think he was saying that they should open later stress tests to non-subs.
---
Vinvest
---
Copying who's on pole. Good move.
---
It's also gear dependent and how fast do you want to be able to solo it.
---
While rogues stealth is great solo, in groups or large world pvp its kinda useless.  Rogues don't scale well in large pvp while that is that Hunters excel at.
---
Both can farm gold easily at around the same pace.  But hunters have the advantage of higher mobility, range and a pet. The dead zone isn't as big of a deal as people make it out to be.
---
quire: *Big iron on his hip*
---
yes
---
I hope they do and they use something else (like afk detection, bot detection) for honor bots
---
Where did you hear they might keep it for the entirety of the first phase?
---
Ion recently stated that their new layering technology will only be in for the first few weeks:
---
&gt; we'll have multiple layered copies of that world, each of which has a capacity similar to what the original servers did at launch.  Over those first few weeks, as players spread out more, we can actually increase the number of people that we put in one version of the world, while also decreasing the number of worlds required to host the whole server.  We're going to continue that process over the first few weeks, until eventually we collapse down, and we promise we will do this a few weeks in, to a single world per realm.
---
You realize I quit my old job and got a new one where I only work 3 times a week, just for WoW, right? You cannot comprehend the time I'm about to sink into this game.
---
That is one washed out looking monitor.
---
level 40, 100g. good luck man
---
follow works fine in wpvp in classic beta so far
---
I‚Äôm just assuming from watching the beta videos that wow classic beta has less lag issues than retail does right now. Recently resubbed in excitement for classic, leveling my character from 110 to 120 since I haven‚Äôt played since legion, and with like perfect home and world latency having 1-2 second delay on all my actions is making this game unplayable. I just sit here sad wishing i was on the beta. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Moist towelette.
---
We missed a lot but most of the dmg was dots. And hunters not sure why hunters are able to hit higher lvl mobs.
---
I'd pay 60
---
&gt; blizzlike
---
I mean
---
Simply put, because their "expansions" aren't.
---
There is only BFA content, and BFA content compared to even level 30 capped vanilla content is not a fair comparison. Vanilla has far more interesting things to offer.  There is a reason people play retail for 2 weeks, get bored and quit while in Vanilla/Classic, people actually have to peel themselves away from the game to keep their life together.
---
I actually think most of the t3 sets look really boring
---
Yea, I agree. Had this same convo today with some friends on Discord. Instead of building upon what works and adding new ideas on top, they try to start fresh every expansion. Throwing away proven successful features and content. It really is somewhat illogical. 
---
There's an argument to be had about keeping things fresh, but I think you could still do that. It'd just be smaller in scope and thus more polished. The rest of the time you'd spend tweaking the systems that worked. Scaling them for the new cap or tweaking some minor aspect.
---
yup ! 1 level 5 without heals can't compete with 2 level 3s with heals
---
Oh come on this dude has 100 followers no way he got an invite for being a streamer. While what he thinks is pretty stupid your pettiness about streamers in this case is just as dumb.
---
heyo
---
I wonder if Blizzard allows this in the since that they dont consider it griefing. I would hope so, I really like all the shit you can do with Mind Control
---
You can't be this dumb
---
you got suckered by hype , spread by influencers aka streamers , some of whom get special invite to play classic and some of them get special invite to beta specially for spreading hype and promote the game. 
---
The words of these streamers are embarassing , they keep repeating how classic made them have friends and how they saw other streamers in game and that made them hyped ... it is like a clown show of hyper salesman trying to sell a product.
---
let face it , without these streamers , i would still resubscribe to WoW and replay it as originally designed for.. Its been far too long since 2005 and i only played alliance even back then. I will reroll horde on clasic and it will be a totally new game for me , totally new zones , in  classic environment..
---
so my advice ? stop watching streamers and instead prepare which class you want to play and learn the class‚Äôs classic skills..
---
or maybe watching lv1 night elf trying to go from darnassus to ironforge
---
Cmon dude....put yourself in the shoes of a developer. Would you honestly skip the couple hundred biggest streamers in favor of true randomness?

you were not there for any launch except for the Overwatch launch where you cosplayed as D.va
---
Engineering is a must, but you can save It for 60.  I like skinning as well because it's easy to farm while leveling.
---
Only issue is that, on a fresh server like classic, I'd imagine a lot of people going the skinning route so you'll most likely just be vendoring the reagents you get.

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmNP6j5IaRw) is a video from 2006 (vanilla WoW) showing level 37 elites hitting a level 44 gnome warrior in berserker stance without a shield for less damage (almost half as much) than Rhahk'zor hits.
---
that's how it worked in vanilla. [here](http://progression-annexe.blogspot.com/2016/02/videos-of-retail-sources-for-vanilla.html) is a whole treasure trove of vanilla videos full of damage values you can look at for future reference.
---
The little payo and defcamp ofc
---
True story
---
Hearthglenn, and Scarlet Monestary LOL
---
Oh it will be a clown show on release. I would be absolutely surprised if the servers won't melt the first 3 days.
---
I hope you run into good people. This Reddit can look toxic at times but we all love the same game. It's better with more people so most of them are willing to work with you.
---
It's a shame they aren't doing a stress test after the name reservation time happens. That seems like the biggest spike subs will see before launch.
---
its probobly a fix against the abuse of bloodrage use then declicking it to remove combat and get a charge in (see swifty warrior tricks)
---
By 5lvl's IMO. Throw anyone who recommends drastic changes out of the building....preferably from the top floor...onto a bullseye labeled bad ideas.
---
For voice coms, mostly during raids, I use Logitech 820e. Ultra lightweight, long wireless range(perfect for keeping an ear on raid status during breaks), call center style business headset.
---
For music only, Audio Technica M50s. But really just for whatever you like at that point. Nice to not have to compromise for voice when choosing a separate set for music.
---
Just my experience.
---
No.
---
You don't need to go LW as a rogue unless you really want to.
---
Id go double gathering and then drop one after 60 so you can pick up Engineering.  Skinning is great and my preference, but you can pick up Herb or Mining if you want (more $$$).  Skinning is just easier because you don't have to scour for nodes.
---
I remember that one time Asmongold made a train of all the people on the server (his viewers) in Dalaran
---
This looks to be way too easy.
---
any hunter who doesn't die with the group gets kicked and blacklisted
---
Then you get that first wand...
---
Skinning coupled with either Mining or Herbing. Change to a crafting profession only after you have reached level 60. 
---
Due to lack of gold in the economy at the Start, vendor the Mats if you need the money. However, if you can, save the Mats for later when the economy stabilizes and then you can sell them for good profits.
---
This is not offensive. Especially if you were the one to accidentally auto attack boss.
---
Not offensive at all. If anything, your party would probably question why you don't feign death to save yourself a repair bill.
---
If you play it as a DPS role, then maybe.
---
Honestly, you can't watch Esfand and still argue Ret is trash.
---
I was also thinking that they could deploy the built 7.3.5 client and backport security and usability features, after all the new client is it's own beast now.
---
Should I do mining or herbing? What would you recommend for a rogue?
---
Haha I really doubt you played retail vanilla with that assessment üòÑ. 
---
I think you forgot about profession, farming, rep grinding, preparing raid consumables, attunements etc. On top of that I‚Äôve never heard about a guild who only raid a single raid a week.
---
The questing in Cataclysm was pretty fun. Too bad they broke all the character builds with it also.
---
It‚Äôs only offensive if you don‚Äôt wipe.
---
Echo chamber at its finest.
---
I am excited for WoW Classic.  But lets not make statements like this until we have the cold hard numbers.  
---
BfA is something that has been out for awhile.  Classic is a game that technically is not even out yet.   
---
Classic is also something that is that has not really happened before in retail.  A successful series, being rebooted to square 1.   
---
The difference in hype and attention should be expected.
---
LMAO this is awesome
---
Thanks brotha!
---
But there are elements of classic that would be so good in retail. I would much prefer layering in retail where your layer is mostly populated by your own realm (if you're on a high pop one) and only splits when overloaded. That doesn't revert any QoL changes in retail.
---
MSI 34" is enough refresh rate. Dont go into 1ms response time. that just bogus to spend more $$ scheme.
---
I have 3 Monitor before (Triple Display Setup) and each of them have different response time from 5-8-20ms. But you would not notice anything at all. even if ur playing mmo. you can see your character walking at the same time on 2 screen (if u put ur char between the 2 screen).
---
Id consider warriors a hybrid. In fact I would call them the only true hybrid class in vanilla. they are the only class that can actually perform two different roles well in raids.
---
That‚Äôs a false equivalence.
---
And I was going to type out a full essay on why I think it‚Äôs just time and how Classic and Modern WoW can only offer specific but separate things to stay alive but never being able to capture and stay at its previous level, Simply due to FTP nature and the existence of FTPs doing the aspects WoW modern and Classic can‚Äôt exceed at, better. But it just made me sad. :l
---
When we reach the post naxx phase, players will be split so much, that you can‚Äôt make something that fits everybody. Some people might want a raid after naxx, while others don‚Äôt even raid
---
TBC kinda works the same for all lvl 60, since it‚Äôs kind of a reset. If they go TBC, I just hope they don‚Äôt force everybody into it, so we end up with no vanilla servers again
---
&gt; Jesus christ just drop it already.
---
You're in the wrong fuckin' thread, buddy.
---
ENFJ-T Mage main, priest alt possibly too.
---
Shame its not going to be out for a year an a half past launch.
---
Do you lead dungeons?
---
BUY AN INSTANT POT. Seriously. As a lazy guy who loves cooking, you can make a shit load of rice. Takes 5 minutes with no effort. Put it in a container. Then make a shit load of chicken and veggies. Also no effort. Boom. Food for like 3-4 days. And also really cheap. Its really like set and forget. Start cooking before a BG or dungeon run and by the time youre done, foods done.
---
Besides all the people telling you otherwise it is indeed possible to change Leatherworking/engineering specs with ['Evil Soothsaying for Dummies'] (https://vanillawowdb.com/?object=177226) which was added 1.11 and so should exist in Classic.
---
Thank you!
---
As this thread is about low caps, I assume he means a fresh server with phases for low caps. Like a month for each 10 levels or something. Interesting for casuals to not fall so far behind, but also for people to explore content at that level more and occassionally shift the meta even during leveling.
---
"Started playing in cata"
---
Your opinion is invalid.
---
I sometimes swapped to a fishing pole to beat low levels to death. So, I think so too.
---
Isnt there one from the quest just outside stratholme?
---
I think there is some examples in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs7ks2/melee_leeway_retail_mechanic_in_classic/
---
INFJ-T. Played Druid my whole life even though I kinda disliked it because I had so much history in that character. Rolling Warlock in classic.
---
I wasn‚Äôt anti flying and never will be for 1 huge reason. 
---
WPVP was already dead on my server and had permanently become a gank fest. All flying did to WPVP was make everyone be able to do rogue BS.
---
Even now the only real interactions in BFA are the same in flying areas or are forced interaction thanks to incursions.
---
Most expensive lottery ticket I've ever bought.

---
Hey man, make sure you look into the roles that both Rogue and Hunter fill in BG's if your serious about PvP.  If you plan on doing your own thing then fuck it, but if you want to find a group of like minded players to queue with then you will be expected to play your appropriate role in a fight.  
---
This doesn't extend to WPvP but it's something to keep in mind.
---
Personally I'll be Hunter -- less gear dependant and I enjoy locking down flags in AB.
---
This has already been addressed here: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/elite-npc-damage-is-way-off-plausible-evidence/178518/77

I hope we will be okay, I‚Äôd hate to be benched all the time lol
---
What I think he means is a new server would open where the level cap would be 40 or something.
---
Tich was down for several days at launch, I actually started on a new server because of it.
---
I think it‚Äôs because even at level 70 he was doing big pulls in vanilla dungeons pretty much exclusively for a very long time.
---
My point which I failed to state I guess in general was you don‚Äôt need to comment if you hate him 
---
Ignore it, literally no reason to go into a thread and be like ‚Äúhurr durr I hate this guy, what a neck beard‚Äù
---
The name reserve thing a couple weeks before release will give them a good indication of players interested.
---
I low key gasped when I saw he had played a video about classic wow, so many memories came flooding back instantly
---
No. In fact I wouldn't play it for more than a couple hours a week if I got in for free. Sure it's very fun obviously, but its spoiled by losing the progress and being limited.
---
Sure, there‚Äôs more to do. But dungeon running ever since WoTLK was ‚Äúhey do you have 15 minutes? Let‚Äôs go run a heroic dungeon!‚Äù
---
In TBC you would at least run all three dungeons in a zone because they were grouped, so why not, and it‚Äôll take less than an hour to clear all three anyway.
---
In Vanilla... ‚Äúhey do you have 2/3 hrs? I‚Äôd like to... form a group, get some pots, then take 15 minutes to get there, fight off some faction opponents, and finally run, oh, maybe just the first half of BRD!‚Äù
---
So even if there wasn‚Äôt as much to do, getting it done was far more meaningful! You didn‚Äôt just join a dungeon finder, or even say ‚ÄúLFG BRD full clear‚Äù and then 20 minutes later you‚Äôre on to the next thing... no, you had to plan out each run. Especially if you weren‚Äôt max level.
---
Yeah, this is a new age for basement dwelling scrubs like him i guess
---
If you're just doing it for gathering, it doesn't really matter which one you pick. You'll be selling everything anyways.
---
Mining is a little more annoying because you have to mine each node a few times, but herbing you can just pick the flowers once.
---
Hard to say right now, but one might be worth more than the other
---
Are you not comparing a boss mob to trash mobs here?
---
Nice screencap
---
Interesting. I recently leveled 5 110s to 120 and didnt run into much of that. Worked up a hunter recently from 40, currently 116 and no recent probs in BFA zones.
---
Wonder if specific clusters are having issues. I'm on Doomhammer/Baelgun and whatever cluster that belongs to. You may want to also do a repair on your game, make sure the game updates you had to do upon resubbibg didnt screw anything up.
---
DON‚ÄôT EVER TALK TO ME OR MY VENDING MACHINE EVER AGAIN!
---
Rehydration is important.
---
Gonna FD on a wipe, better have something to Rez a healer like goblin jumper cables. To justify avoiding the repair bills, since 9/10 times it‚Äôs usually the hunter that A pulled extra trash or B auto attacked boss while tab targeting.
---
What addon is he using for the changed text of his player frames and combat text?
---
No but people who played with friends went to follow them to things like League of Legends. 
---
People wanting competitive PvP went to League and Dota.
---
You have to remember TBC-WOTLK WoW WAS the Fortnite of the era. And when other games came in and did stuff better than what WoW was doing they lost players. 
---
IMO that‚Äôs why they tried to focus on Raiding and dipped their feet into immersive story telling in legion. And why Raiding is so good right now but a lot else is just kinda ehhh or bad. 
---
With the culture and FTP market I just don‚Äôt think WoW I‚Äôd released now could ever hit and maintain those numbers.
---
You think you do, but you... do???
---
Oooooooo maybe it should be harder to level actually.
---
I think they're going to disable some stuff, but largely works like the modern client. Would be hard to test without Beta access, though
---
Lmao the fact that you didn't even type the bug in your post is the funniest part. Fucking flight path animation, what a joke

I tried once and i fell out of the chair. It doesnt make sense
---
Good recommendations, but I wouldn't ever say that a profession is a "must". Engineering is nice for rogues, though.
---
We have no idea because there are conflicting statements from Blizzard.
---
Personally, I'm out of they progress into BC.  For me Vanilla is the best part of the games cycle and stands leagues above what followed.
---
I would love them to go the OSRS route and add custom content and community voting.
---
[I mean...](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/012/132/thatsthejoke.jpg)
---
Oh look, more rat-man.
---
Ok, so just get dual gathering and vendor the mats until the economy is stable?
---
I dont have a source but I thinkbit was due to the bew modelsvnot looking good with old armor
---
I‚Äôd still hold off. For preach I imagine for him to fully convert Raiding would have to keep him entertained for a long time. Because he‚Äôs been praising modern raids for a while.
---
Some of the best rogue pvp trinkets are obscure  
---
\-The engi frost deflect one for example is very good vs mages / hunters, letting you reflect frost traps and frost nova.   
---
\-Drakefang Talisman is an amazing stat stick and the dodge is important.  
---
\-Renataki's is very good but will be added in later (phase 4)  
---
\- Both Heroism and Maelstrom are good decks for rogue  
---
\- Hand of Justice is one of the best trinkets for pure damage, giving you the chance to proc an extra attack.   
---
There are quite a few options.
---
I heard that preach is a homosexual, so I can no longer be a part of his community.   My religious beliefs forbid such interactions.   I will have to report this at my next reading.

If retail fails and there isnt a classic WotLK I would just leave the game permanently. Not because I dislike classic or bfa, but because I love being a feral cat and if I cant successfully do that I wouldn't want to play.
---
ya
---
Not impossible at all, just different
---
People in Vanilla didn't worry so much about min/max. Just played the game and chilled.
---
its not a normal beta, its just purely for advertising purposes

And the last stress test was not EU friendly time wise aswell. It started at 1am where I live, so I was already sleeping at that point, like many others.

People are saying that the game in general is laggy/delayed. Clicking on vendors is delayed, hotkeys are delayed, looting is delayed, etc. Joana himself even commented on this. This is something I'm actually worried about, especially after hearing people complain about retail having lag in the exact same way.

wait, wtf is that background scenery? That's real?

I watched people run SM cathedral on lvl 30. This is just insane. First lvl 38 elite was doing sub 60 dmg CRUSHING BLOWS.
---
I have hard time finding any video of people doing it on live vanilla @ level 40, oldest videos I see (uploaded 12 years ago) are lvl 60 farming guides.
---
Anything close to being relevant on youtub is from private server, and same mob dealt 120dmg hits there. This is in no way proof, but would they really be 400% dmg off?

Yeah one thing thats going to hurt in classic is we are going to have to deal with the bleed of players in casual guilds and systems like the one I mentioned and the one you are describing I think will start popping up.

Did Preach really see the light, or did he see the dollar signs?    LOL!   Let's be real here kids.

They fixed it later on. I kited it before.

For all of the shortcomings of retail WoW, pushing mythic+ and learning how to optimize my uptime during some of the more complex raid mechanics has made me a much better player. Of course being older and more experienced in everything helps this greatly, too.

Also, a funny side effect of the current game being so easy and leaning towards instant gratification is that it's given me the opportunity to learn different roles and classes in a reasonable amount of time. 14 year old me wasn't going to spend another 3 months leveling a healer just to see if I'd enjoy it. While I may not be pushing truly difficult content on all my characters, I've experienced some of the common issues and annoyances in group content that comes native to playing certain roles, and that has made me so much more aware of not only my own actions but of everything that's going on in an encounter.
---
Also learning to squeeze efficiency out of addons like WeakAuras for instance.
---
So many things that are universal to the game regardless of the mechanics in that encounter or class you're playing have been learned too. Many things are quite basic too and I'm sure good players knew back then but I didn't, like resource pooling if you're on a rogue for example and how to make the most of that, instead of just using abilities the very instant you could.

Linken's Boomerang

---
When your party is slaughtered? Sure.
---
When there's a fighting chance but you don't want to die? Well...
---
Fuck outta here.
---
I agree something feels off. They really need to make 200% sure that the numbers aren't scuffed. 
---
Rogues and Warriors that always had a kind of "hard" time leveling (at least compared to other classes) are breezing through quests/mobs on the beta. Something seems off.
---
its never 20%, more like 14% besides as I said healing it is not a problem.
---
Why would i make it inaccurate on purpose? That doesn‚Äôt make sense at all. 
---
I made the original calculations as best/realistically i could and now making small changes to optimalise realistic calculations.
---
find yourself someone who loves the same stuff you do! my wife has never played classic wow, but we play games together all the time, and she is excited to play wow with me!
---
All this shit of people who are married to someone who wouldent even try something as significant to them as classic wow is downright depressing and it makes me sad that some people live that way
---
Most games launch with tons of tiny, little bugs. They won't get everything, but 3 months (not 2) is a lot of time to fix a majority of what is being pointed out.
---
Used Sinister Strike as my main skill on dagger rogue.
---
Everyone forgets about Manual Crowd Pummeler :(
---
If I were to go back 15 years, the simple /common mistakes some new hunters would make off the top of my head:
---
1) make sure your pet isn‚Äôt enabled to pull threat off the tank. Un-managed pets in dungeons is the easiest way to build a bad reputation in a group as a hunter.
---
2) always try to pull mobs and CC (crowd control) monsters to help your team better manage fights. 
---
3) you might be tempted to wear fancy mail armor with Strength on it. Stay away, stick to Agility (agility = ranged dps). Melee hunters are not viable in classic wow. 
---
4) Good hunters learn how to kite, and are always guarding their dead-zones (the melee range zone where you can‚Äôt  used weapons. Your enemies will try to trap you here to easy kill you).  Kiting includes running away, jumping, turning mid-jump to shoot arrows and skills, then back continue running in circles.
---
5) make sure you have enough arrow. Classic WoW requires you to manage your arrow count and quiver. Quiver takes up 1 bag slot, so as a hunter you need to manage your storage a bit better
---
6) your pet has happiness and needs to be fed. Make sure you take good care of pet!
---
Have fun!
---
how did the dragon end up at stormwind
---
WotLK spready jad dungeon finder so this was 1st step. It was still good due to no LFR.
---
Gee its almost like they are hopping on a band wagon of some sort to cash in on the higher viewer numbers for money...... im so surprised they changed their minds about classic, it sure was lucky that so many streamers "enjoy" the game AND get more viewers at the same time, WOW
---
The scarlet casters in the UD starting zone are brutal as a warrior. If you miss once, they'll probably kill you because of frost armor slowing your attacks. The spiders in the cave will fuck you up, too. Most starting areas have something really, really tough at level. The trolls guarding Felix's shit and in the cave are also great examples.
---
I always had the problem of running as a tank but dps taking all the tank loot.
---
MC in EoTS in BC was my jam.
---
Whiners are attacked and mocked on the official forums, as they RIGHTFULLY should be, because it's because of those wankers WOW is in the state it is today.
---
Oo good note on the pet happiness. I need to look up a guide on that and which pets to get!
---
That would get you the most money, for sure. I would only vendor right at the beginning because once people start to get a little bit of money, you'll be able to sell most materials for more than vendor prices easily
---
I haven't watched the guy in years, but he was chill in the Diablo days. It seems like such a huge character flip if he is just acting. We do have people like Mcconnel who are always in character, and sometimes Esfand and Soda act dumb as fuck and/or rage for clips, so it's possible Quinn is too, but it really feels like Quinn is just getting mad as fuck because he sucks and keeps getting shit on. Diablo skill doesn't translate well to WoW apparently and it's gonna take him a while to get good. Hopefully sooner than later so we don't have to keep hearing him screech.
---
Remember retail wow and classic wow are completely different hunter play guides.
---
:}}}}}
---
You‚Äôre the worst kind of person
---
Thank you
---
Whattttuuuuppppp
---
Bag space is super important.  Get all the bags.
---
Double up on gathering professions while you level (you can drop one or both at 60 if you want to craft for grab Engineering).
---
Behave yourself -- act like the community you want to be surrounded by.
---
ALWAYS.  HAVE.  AMMO.
---
ALWAYS.  HAVE.  PETFOOD.
---
Basic stuff for you.
---
1. I wasn't wrong
---
2. nobody was correcting me
---
3. you're braindead af
---
4. get a life then mr negative comments less than three ecks and dee
---
You still have to develop wand skills and it can miss/they resist
---
Albeit, wands are a great item as casters .
---
I‚Äôd say classic with Modern Raid Mechanics, Story, and Difficulty. 
---
But also MoP class design but without the new talent trees. Just they way those classes were felt so good and fun. Especially warlock.
---
That would be about 6.49$ today. Still not a lot of money
---
Mods please do this. Please please please! Amazing, yet simple, suggestion.
---
So did I. Fortunately I unlockes zandalari trolls and am currently leveling a druid. That's actually way more fun than doing the content in BFA .
---
He‚Äôs such a shill that Blizzard banned him ingame and irl.
---
14% from leather to plate? You are way off.
---
I have spent 3 years researching, testing, and theory crafting. I've played all the weird shit people think is good, spirit war, agi war, etc. And it's a funny to watch them get shredded to bits on pvp servers.
---
And yeah you can just have a rogue tank, not doing your job and getting carried doesn't mean what you are doing is viable. If your strat involves other players having to work hard you are not playing your role right...
---
Twink peaks &gt; any other map ;)
---
and yes i do plan to compete in rated bg's and look for premade team.. also yea, i know both class has their own roles,  but i already expect this in a competitive scene for bg.
---
this is great man thanks
---
Esfand disagrees
---
That‚Äôs one of those things not many people would be willing to admit on a public platform.
---
These beta testers think outside the box. We need more of these.
---
Is there a normal speed version?
---
If your highest priority is to keep people subbed, why actively work against every community "MMO" aspect of the game?  I never understood this.  I mean look at WOW today, people phase in and out of existence, there are no individual realms, hell you can ding from 1 to 120 without saying a word, it's all so contradictory.
---
If it makes you feel better, the guy was a total dbag, and wasted tens of thousands on mobile games.
---
Filtering out most of this subreddit, complaining about the game or complaining about complaining is the norm.
---
This was already posted like three times earlier today
---
Layering is still a whole servers population. There will be nearly 3,000 players on every layer
---
Bets are good when a shield does drop someone else will need on it.
---
Got it fixed, thank you so much! Thank you for the time you put into this, I'm enjoying it tremendously!
---
Honestly, I would just play and enjoy the game without having to do all this research and reading. Just play, you'll make "mistakes" but you'll learn
---
Who cares? It's more valuable to get the Beta in front of thousands of people with a single invite than in front of one person. Imagine how many fewer bugs would be found. Don't be salty because you can't "get early access".
---
Doesn't seem to be the case in beta. Maybe you remember wrong.
---
the music in this video in sync with the frames per second just makes me happy
---
Why? The game started at 1, not 60.
---
While you are 110% correctI don‚Äôt look for logic in anything Blizz does anymore. 
---
This is the same company that laid off Ythisens and kept Lore.
---
It can be frowned upon especially in raids, usually fd won't save you from dying and will only cost the raid extra time
---
no why would it be?
---
as long as you do it in the right spot and don't pull aggro when you end the ability
---
rogues vanish too and it's normal
---
I'm exercising to try and drop 10 lbs or so. And finishing retail toons 120 leveling. Possibly going to bust out the PS3 and play an old Final Fantasy fav in the 6-9 range if I have time. Whatever one has the cards minigame probably :)
---
Fun fact. A Hunter who is also an engineer can Gnomish Mind Control Cap and then Eyes of the Beast and achieve the same thing. You would have to dismiss your pet first.
---
I feel your pain, fellow educator. But hey, I put off my studies when I played WoW as a student... Looks like it's time for my classes to watch movies!
---
Getting mail is easy and you don't have to go there as soon as you hit 17
---
So you never played it.
---
Warri will keep all aggro and do a fair amount of dmg without a problem. Healer barely has to work more aswell.
---
And yes, its about 14%.
---
You do also realize spirit warrior is not weird shit but one of the best before lv 40? Especially for solo leveling.
---
For profession, Leatherworking and Skinning seem to be the most popular (craft armor and quivers).  Alchemy and Herbalism (potions), in addition to Engineering/Mining are popular 2nd options.  Engineering is useful in pvp, but most engineers are poor as it‚Äôs a huge money-sink. 
---
I don‚Äôt think any specific profession will make or break your in game experience for you. Feel free to do what you want. You just might not find any (if much) benefits to Tailoring.  
---
For Secondary professions, cooking, first aid, and fishing are all really great for hunters. Hunters do not have many heals, first aid is almost mandatory for PvP.  Cooking and fishing are great buffs and useful resources for also feeding your pet if the diet allows.
---
Good point, it'll still be tough at the very beginning, but not apocalyptic
---
Classic retail wow was horrible for days and weeks at the start, lol
---
Possibly.
---
Private server.
---
Here, let me explain why blizzard is wrong because my 15 year old memory makes  me 'feeeeel' they're wrong even though blizzard, being the only ones with the real numbers, has already proven mob damage is correct.
---
Skinning is a good way to make mony pre 60, if you are trying to level a bit faster don't skin corpses if they don't give a skill point until you hit heavy leathers. When it comes to your second profession in the long run herbalism tends to win out on the money making side over mining however if you are going engineering for pvp it is nice to be able to farm your own mats. As a side note if you are dropping skinning it might be worth to get the devilosaur leather you need and a Pristine hide of the beast before dropping it and lastly if you ever intend on going the enchanting profession do it from the start low level mats costs a pretty penny and just disenchanting quest and previously used gear vill give you level 75 and a lot of mats. Another side note you only need level 1 enchanting to disenchant any gear in the game. Making it a decent mony maker when running dungeons/levelling if you are willing to save the mats for later in the server life
---
The missing information is that it's not complete tech yet. It's very much still a WIP and probably a focus of the stress tests. Esfand was saying on stream that at the Summit they said it was still incomplete/WIP.
---
I wouldn't sweat it, I trust them to get it right after everything we've seen so far with the classic team I think they've earned that.
---
Actually that is wrong behavior, the mob should turn around and move but since classic is based on the cucked legion client it will never work like it did originally.
---
 Intentional or not it seems as though a number of things have been made easier on the classic beta.
---
This makes me worried for classic. I hope they look into this, and a number of other things that have been noticed, or it will just be to easy. What scares me the most is that this is could have all been done intentionally to make the game more accommodating to a more casual player-base. One can only wonder what raiding will be like at this rate.
---
I know pserver values are not accurate, as someone who has religiously played both retail vanilla and pservers. However, there is no way what I have seen thus far in the beta is. People are blowing through content MUCH easier than they should be able to. Elite mobs are looking like a joke, same with a lot of the regular mobs. In the stress test I was able to chain pull mobs 4-5 levels higher than me.
---
They removed.
---
Everything.
---
They arbitrarily leave some shit in and remove others, it‚Äôs bullshit.
---
I think a vast majority of players would be opposed to any re-balancing, at least at first. Strictly because they want the classic experience to be re-created faithfully. It would be a really slippery slope for Blizzard to start adjusting balance.
---
Eh, idk man.. raiding is going to be a lot easier, without dial up most of the raid content is like very easy to do... 3 man onyxia, 10-15 man MC runs, Rags going to die in like 2 weeks, so the fact you won't be grinding out hours of raid content per week opens up a lot of additional time.
---
Will prollly be quite crowded even after 2 weeks :)
---
Wait where tf is that portal in the instance?
---
I've never seen this, this is AMAZING
---
Man, you be damn proud if you hit level 60 and reach end game before you get sick and tired of the grind. 
---
Sit back, get camped on by murlocs, and enjoy the epic, classic ride that it is.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt care too much about balance, everyone one-shots everyone :)
---
I said it‚Äôs one of the all time greats, Nighthold is really good too. 
---
The dungeon and raid design has been stellar; and I think that stems from Ion‚Äôs past as primarily someone who worked on raids when he was first employed by Blizzard. 
---
Now if they could only fix the rest of the game...
---
As of now, the mounts are not in the game. Assumptions are that it will stay that way.
---
I remember sin scaling better but combat swords was far easier to play and roughly equal in MC.
---
Oh right, that thing :D gonna keep it in mind. Just didn't want to roll yet another mage since they seem to be somewhat comfortable and the goto choice.
---
Yeah it's not a bug bit a dragon.
---
Seriously: I think the bug is that some NPC's aren't attacking, which should.
---
Nothing on private servers is hard.
---
S o M a N y E x P l O i T s A v A i L a B l E
---
Right on.  TP is a great BG and I actually prefer it over wsg.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for the grind :)
---
I think most people who miss classic wow, miss it for the RPG aspects that made the entire brand of WoW. Class balancing puts all class uniqueness at risk and is a dangerous thought that will be heavily frowned upon immediately. 
---
I played a priest, I still had fun as Shadow in classic WoW. Less opportunities, but the game wasn‚Äôt any less fun.
---
if they changed the game it wouldn't be the same game
---
As a hunter, at least, close to 50% of your damage was auto attacks.
---
Looking forward to it.
---
You should remake this thread 6months after all the classic content is out. I"m not saying you're right or wrong, however i am saying were few weeks into the beta and it's too early.
---
staysafe is a misogynist lol, if you ever played with him on a private server you would know this
---
him and esfand (esfand isn't a misogynist) only got popular because they spammed private server chats with their streams for like 2 years
---
This zone fucking sucks and is only fun to pvp in if you're a geared alt or a stealth class tbh.
---
I should specify that it's a must **if you want to PvP**
---
Let your kid pick his dinner every night and he will choose ice cream. Once he gets to high school and is an onset type B diabetic with fat rolls under his ears that no girls will look at he will feel that you failed him as a parent, despite your every concession to his desires.
---
Yeah I guess the question is how far can I go with one proper raid a week. That I can do consistently, it becomes hard when I need to do 2x 3.5 hours over a period of time.
---
i mean i played flanker roles in other mmorpg , so that shouldnt be an issue for me..
---
&gt;He's playing to an audience of edgy teenagers instead of doing his own thing.
---
nah he actually means most of the stuff he says, he hates women for example
---
I got invited to the stress test, but that is separate than beta waves.
---
Asking questions means your ahead of the noob curve. Asking is good. Level slow and absorb the info. I liked large levelving guilds, they are very supportive but will not feel bad when you leave either. Then bring your alt in to leveling guild.
---
If you're a warlock that has summoned the boss for the mount quest you can summon it for other warlock. The items cost a few hundred gold
---
This is awesome! Can‚Äôt wait to actually use these myself either when the game comes out or if I ever get into beta.
---
Yea you might be right. And I know I dont have the will power to wait a month. I am a little worried about picking the right server though. I started vanilla in ¬¥05 and everything was already pretty established.
---
Riding an epic mount in vanilla wow makes you a god
---
Me. I'm not watching this. I'd rather wait for the "Asmongold reacts to Preach talking about Classic" video.
---
Whirlwind axe is a viable weapon until well after 40, so I would choose the weapon based on what is optimal after 40 rather than for the few levels prior to that.
---
Overpower, like MS, does more damage with a slower weapon. According to what people in the current beta have found, if you sweeping strike/whirlwind/cleave a secondary mob, and they dodge, you can tab over to them and overpower them. This means if you take 2 mobs at a time there will be lots of opportunities to use this skill.
---
If you're human you can get the whirlwind mace but the mace spec talent (small chance to stun) is awful compared to axe spec +5% crit.
---
I see, that's a fair suggestion. Especially considering most of my friends don't play at all anymore (my partner in crime just got his baby). I'll need to find some new internet friends to play with.
---
This was the first I had heard of this particular claim too. So I did some light googling and sure enough it seems about as factual as anything reported online can claim to be. I'm not going to disrespect you or anyone else curious about this claim by posting any links.
---
probably not, layering will solve that, they aren't making many realms even though they should
---
if a server truly dies they will probably offer free transfers
---
I stated I've played it. And you immediately reply so you've never played it? Are you incompetent or illiterate?
---
Also it's 14% for early mail gear, maybe. For 40-59 plate it's going to be like 25-30% more mitigation, minimum. 
---
Lastly, leveling spirit is going to get you fucking plowed on a pvp server over and over until it's like throwing a hot dog down a hallway. And it's only useful if private server coefficients are accurate which they are already shown to be wrong. Another problem is that the moment you add in anything like bandages spirit warrior becomes drastically slower than a regular dps based warrior with bandages over the course of an area. 
---
All these theories are popular solely because of pserver mistakes and lack of application of one or more mechanics of the game. Losing 2-3 seconds on a mob to gain 4-5 seconds of regeneration is good. Unless you have bandages, and then it's lose 2-3 seconds to gain 1-2.... which is a negative value...
---
These things are only viable if you play very lazy and don't ever run into pvp situations. If you lose 1 1v1 that you would have won if you were wearing bear mail armor. You save 5-10 minutes on a run back. That single run back saves you way more time than spirit ever did...
---
&gt;ts been a bit of a surprise hearing so many WoW personalities kind of do a 180 on Classic.
---
Really?  
---
MONEY $$$$$ MONEY $$$$$$$ MONEEEY $$$$$$
---
&gt;  but that makes me worry the hype for Classic will be *way* higher than Blizzard thinks, 
---
No one has a clue, that's why blizz is doing the character creation thing.  
---
Personally, I suspect over a million people create characters.   But the number that actively play them will be a small fraction of that.  If it's even 10%, I would be surprised.
---
Yeah, but not very forceful about it and I let others do it if they think they know what to do. I‚Äôm introverted but still pretty ok at interacting with people. Can‚Äùturn it in‚Äù pretty well so to speak :)
---
It Depends, because warrior may need to offtank sometimes and a tf is a really great weapon for threat generation... but I guess rewarding a really good rogue with a tf is a good thing!
---
After thinking about the whole situation I woke up with the realization that I can't do more than one day a week *consistently*. Mfw I read your post. This sounds very reasonable. I'll drop you a message, who knows maybe we don't live worlds / regions across irl.
---
No. I won‚Äôt even watch streams. I don‚Äôt want to see any gameplay until I can fully get immersed into the actual game. I‚Äôm only on here to get some questions answered.
---
YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR DPS PRIVLEGE BOY
---
The WoW community is literally the only gaming community I know that thinks of unfinished, unpolished content as "having charm".
---
Everyone else would flame the devs.
---
Wyvern sting is terrible, should put that point into scatter but keep the surv build somewhat the same, counter attack and lightning reflexes are amazing, and really add a nice crit / damage boost as well as some much needed melee utility.
---
Did they come out with an official statement saying they won‚Äôt be releasing many realms? 
---
I imagine realms will have long waiting queues due to streamers so I sure hope they have more realms / and-or a bigger bandwidth to get players in.
---
To the right of the exit from flagroom and Gy on both sides. I see you have not seen the vanilla wsg map my friend
---
so wrong it hurts. Spirit warrior was a thing 15 years ago &amp; websites from back then still have it.
---
And no, its going to be about 14%.
---
Were there even any quests apart from the Zentaur clan quests?
---
I agree that this isn't right. I mean look at these guys soloing SM Armory and Cath at level 30. The damage is broken. I played as a healer in vanilla and did all of these dungeons, and this isn't even close to right. I'm also in beta playing a warlock and have pulled 5 elites on me while casting hellfire and survived with minimal healing... it's a joke. Hopefully they thoroughly test this and find the issue soon, as it's inhibiting our ability to properly test the content.
---
Sorry, but flying and LFD basically destroyed the traditional mmo elements of the game. Nobody has to actually participate in or interact with the actual world outside of a capitol city. Watering down character builds and class niches was the finishing move. It's why I stopped playing very early into Mists. At that point I was only hanging around due to nostalgia. I realized the game could never be what it once was. Realize that this is coming from someone who was in a high end raiding guild and still enjoyed that part of the game.
---
layering solves the problem of having many realms without the worry of them dying
---
blizzard won't even make rp servers lmao they are scared as fuck to make realms
---
I would blind someone and then not know what to do.
---
Sigh
---
That item doesn't let you attack, it was just noteworthy for being the only item Paladins (and I think Druids and Shamans too?) could equip in their ranged slot before relics were added.
---
Fake and gay
---
I too am a masochist.
---
Also: play the original RTS games. They drive the story into classic and not to mention they're insane fun.
---
Rofl
---
bro you just posted cringe! you are going to lose subscriber!
---
I had quests that lead me into a dungeon as a level 20. I tried to do it by myself and only got so far by corpse dragging and tried to get out of said dungeon the same way. Until my friend showed me the hearthstone.
---
Shaman is prolly the favorite, my least favorite is druid because outside of resto its absolute garbage till BC prepatch unless you have tons of gold to try and make other builds competitive off consumables.
---
Lol, damn repeating what you said without actually providing any evidence. What a strong argument.
---
Hey now you should say something like, back on my server a full spirit warrior 1shot thrall so it's clearly best. Or some other dumb shit to prove you are a fucking idiot
---
Holy shit.. what a blast from the past. I was on this guy‚Äôs server, he carried me through SM a couple times back in the wotlk days. I never knew he was a youtuber as well, small world!
---
I'm fairly sure they patched this being actually effective - since crit/hit/glancing chance was a function of weapon skill / level cap weapon skill. There was a hilarious interaction with this and fishing pole feral druids running around in the 35-40 level range with 70%+ crit chance (I myself had one) by having a 400+ weapon skill / 200 weapon skill cap
---
updated my post, added a few question if u dont mind taking a look!
---
So the ultra zero monsters instead of the regular ones, got it.
---
Says the idiot here.
---
Go be dumb somewhere else, besides the burden of proof is on your aide, you are the first one that spew numbers, especially absurd ones.
---
I dont disagree. I just pointed out that when these changes happened the majority wanted them.
---
more of these less xqc and moxys
---
the whole mechanic with trap is surely fun if u land, this extra skill floor is what making it harder for me to pick between the two, since i do love high skill ceiling classes were u can tell an avg player to the guy who knows his shit.
---
also i updated my post, added a few question if u dont mind taking a look!
---
WoD was crazy, people were so hyped and they had like 2 million additional new and returning players and blizz had no idea and just shit the bed.
---
Are you trying to insult me, or do you just not believe that I am playing since Vanilla?
---
Obviously I do not mean just "human life". I mean the fact that if there is a cap of 3k people there will be 500-600 in Deathknell. There will literally be no mob alive, and spawn camping is not fun for me, but maybe it is for you.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
everything till AQ 40 is going to be easy, to do content past that its just a time sink most casuals won't bother with.
---
This is leeway, not prediction. Both players running in a straight line is the best case scenario for prediction (which means that for the lagging player the predicted client-side and server-side positions will agree most of the time). There is no reason for the melee range to be so large.
---
I think Quin is the most annoying one. Loud and swears like a sailor about trivial stuff.
---
Needs a Horde and Alliance banner logo
---
It also previous worked with skinning knife : skinning skill and mining pick : mining skill - but I can't for the life of me find the patch where they took this out so I may be going crazy
---
I'd dm you some IRL gold if you made one of a male undead rogue in full bloodfang, two perds blades and theyre the only thing animated.
---
A solo hunter is better off with a owl, bat or carrion bird
---
Depends upon context
---
If we're dodging pats yes it's in bad taste to just sit there. Although you can certainly feign and move back to the gruop. If some retard pulls and we're clearing shit with four because you wanted to feign you're gonna get my ire. 
---
If it's just a straight run back to your death there is no BM in feigning.
---
Most pve mages mostly ended up as frost around MC and BWL, and only did the respec dance when farming BWL and pushing AQ (and some guilds didn't bother with AQ).  After some point, you can mostly just stay fire.  
---
Rogues, like most classes, end up respecing if they love both pve and pvp.  
---
But rogue will definitely work out.  It's a fun and good class.
---
Not only that, but he doesn't even know what DPS is. Yes, Rhahk'zor hits harder, he also swings slower.
---
Warrior leveling is fine.
---
In what reality do you get a Warrior to 60 on 4 days played? (7 hours a day \* 2 weeks - 98 hours). You're deluded man.
---
Lol says the guy repeating 14% over and over again as if it's a fact. I said numbers as estimates, which are estimates... you say 14 like it's a blue post.
---
Also no burden of proof is on the guy trying to upset convention, or go against the normal mentality. Leather agi/spirit gear is not the normal mentality, a select vocal minority preach it and that's it. It hasn't been thoroughly proven to be better, and drastically varies in use depending on the server it's on.
---
So again, you have no clue what you are talking about.
---
You would be surprised if 100k people play classic? Considering over 100k people play LH, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre terrible at estimations.
---
Not for alliance it isnt! Probably one of the worst zones, imo
---
Exactly this. People asked for qol stuff, Blizz gave it to them, then they got bored
---
also the boar boss has a faster attack speed so you can't solely compare the damage of each strike individually.  Not that this info makes a huge difference, but worth noting.
---
The biggest problems of the subpar specs is the prejudice. Shadow priest has good damage, but lacks sustain, which they got in TBC and became instant gods. There's room for 1 shitty offspec in any raid, if the people there won't be salty you get to be the specialboi. They all bring some kind of buff to the group they're in.
---
 - Shadow Priest has shadow weaving
---
 - Oomkin has spellcrit aura
---
 - Ele has mana spring / tranquil
---
 - Enha has imp WF and can twist to either grace or tranquils.
---
While whatever they bring doesn't always make up for their lesser dps, it's all gucci and you can clear basically anything if you've raided anything from cata to bfa.
---
And yeah, class balancing would not be cool. Maybe something they can look at after the world gets to relive classic.
---
I know that class balance is crap in vanilla. But changeling is a massive undertaking. First of alot of the talent trees need to be tweaked, second there needs to be new gear added to level 60 dungeons and all the raids, thirdly the alot of the of specs add debuffs to the targets this has to be reworked some how, fourthly the pvp balance in vanilla vas kinda like a rock, paper, scissor kinda thing any changes eaven small ones can and will have impacts on pvp some of them will be unforseen. Given all that I really don't se how it us eaven posible to change it. We will just have to wait for TBC.
---
Oh god are you dumb.
---
I didn't even manage to hit 120 with any of my accounts :/
---
It's gonna be another WoD. Blizzard is going to not be expecting there to be nearly as many players as there will actually be, servers will shit the bed, and the playerbase dies off in a few weeks, not from a lack of interest but because people will be fed up with having to wait for the servers not to be trash to play.
---
So, you want an empty subreddit?
---
xD
---
Retail is too far gone. There is no coming back from that steaming pile of shit. Of others happen to enjoy the taste of said steaming shit, then more power to them and to each their own.
---
They haven't proven anything. They've claimed they're correct. They haven't released evidence of anything.
---
If I remember right they mostly hated it for the stress on the server or impossible to kill bosses because they healed faster then NPCs and lowbies could take them down. 
---
First one shouldn't be an issue anymore.
---
Can we get a streamer subreddit for all streamer posts?
---
On the to do list :-).
---
92 hours could get you a bit further probably.
---
What an epic game golden eye was!  
---
Both solo and multiplayer modes were amazing
---
Such a strong counter point. I am blessed with your wisdom
---
Melee shaman are going to put up shit dps numbers compared to the rogue and warrior. But they need your wind fury totem, and the mage can‚Äôt self Rez to prevent s runback. Classes were balanced because they provided different skill sets and benefits to a group. No a shaman will not do amazing dps in Raids, but with every knowing what content we get, if you play your class competently there is no reason you shouldn‚Äôt be able to raid as an enchance shaman. You don‚Äôt need 25 top tier dps In a 40 man to clear content
---
I‚Äôll do you one better. Name an appealing expansion that doesn‚Äôt raise the level cap
---
Thanks to copyright restrictions, nope PepeLaugh
---
100k accounts maybe, but not active players.  That's also free vs $15 a mo, which is an outrageous $ for a remake.
---
What's the weapon called? Never heard of this and now I'm curious.
---
Rogue may have more abilities to use but at the end of the day your mission is to lock them down. Hunter is more friendly but rogue will take you farther if you stick around for more than a couple of months.
---
Actually it wont even work, in Vanilla the monsters will mob and kill you once your team is gone. They wont unaggro.
---
Yes it's very exaggerated. I have leveled 5 warriors to 60 and never felt it was hard or painful
---
The only zone i hate in the game
---
Sun Rock Retreat has always been my favorite place in wow. Not because the content was really cool or because I got some uber rare item to drop near there. Nope, it's just a chill ass place.
---
Region - NA
---
Server - PvP
---
Faction - Either (Prefer Alliance, but it‚Äôs not solidified)
---
Playtimes - MST, mornings (9 AM - 1 PM local on weekdays)
---
Looking for a guild with a morning activity. I‚Äôd like to be able to do raid content in the morning and do that type of progression, but I have a second shift schedule, so I‚Äôm not able to do so at night. I‚Äôll also PvP during the day too. My main focus will be PvP, but I do enjoy doing raid content for the gear.
---
PM me here if there‚Äôs anybody with morning activity guilds, preferably MST or PST times.
---
I did the same, but I'm just using the time to make a ton of gold for wow tokens so I dont have to pay once classic comes out
---
Yeah definitly not the Warrior with instense aggro shouting everywhere right? Blame the hunter &gt;&gt; Classic WoW is Classic.
---
In 2004, it would be 2004 WoW, in 2019, 2019 classic WoW is what we have and 2004 is 15 years in the past. So given the choices of 2019 Classic or nothing at all, I‚Äôll take Classic.
---
I can say that with certaintity because there was an overwhelmingly positive reaction for these things. Show me one comment from back then that complained about flying before it happened and Ill show you 100 that wanted it.   
---
This sub is filled with Captain Hindsights.
---
Engineering is considered the best all around for rogues, due to QoL additions it can provide for PvE and how strong it is for PvP, mining of course would be a good secondary.  
---
Herb / Alc is also very good for crafting your poisons / gathering fade leaf for blinding powder  
---
Cooking is a must for thistle tea
---
I feel like I'm the only one(probably not), who will avoid streamers servers like plague. Most content is great to watch but I dont get kicks out of following someone and hoping they mention my name on stream. Also someone with massive influence can affect the server in many ways, good and bad.
---
Cata did some things way better than wrath. Particularly in five man content, and making mana actually matter.
---
Post your name here so I can preemptively black list you.
---
Feral cat in vanilla should be ok without any issues, you might have to jump out and decurse and maybe offtank once in a while but it's viable.
---
6 priests in a raid and almost every priest wants to go shadow and you only take 1 shadow. So good luck getting the spot.
---
It should be reposted every day until it's addressed by Blizzard.
---
Retail beckons.
---
That is exactly my point though
---
Played my dwarf hunter until lvl 15-20 as full melee class
---
**[LFG][NA-Horde][PVP Server]**
---
**Availability:** Weekday evenings, PST-friendly hours. I have a full-time job and I have social obligations on the weekends which limit my hours. I'm open to a 2-3 nights a week schedule but I can raid extra days including weekends in progression situations where we're close to getting a clear.
---
**Classes**: Hunter but I'm open to playing Warlock as well. Realistically, I'm probably going to have at least one serious alt for farming or for raid/party flexibility.
---
**Goals:** Long-term friends to do content with, clearing Naxx, and reaching Rank 11 in PVP. Listed in order of importance.
---
**WoW Experience**: Played a Resto/Feral Druid fourteen years ago and made it to the Twin Emperors in AQ40. Continued playing a Druid through TBC and eventually switched to Death Knight in WotLK. Quit playing after Ulduar but came back during Legion briefly.
---
**About me**: I'm a 31 year old office worker that has been playing MMOs ever since I got a PC when I was twelve. While WoW used to be my main MMO, I've mostly been active on FFXIV where I raided at a Hardcore level [clearing content within two weeks of it's release](https://twitter.com/Leuk0s/status/1045582839914225666) and [participating in Speedruns](https://www.fflogs.com/character/id/57684?mode=detailed&amp;zone=21#metric=dps). I got hit hard by burnout and left my raid team and I don't think I can maintain that level of intensity any more.
---
**What to expect from me**: I plan on getting to level 60 within 2-4 weeks depending on whether or not I can take some time off work. I plan to be self-sufficient in regards to consumables, have fights researched ahead of time, and to show up early before each raid. While Warcraftlogs are not that big of a factor for me, I hope to show improvement from week to week and to finish strong by the end of each raid tier. I don't mind sitting on the bench and farming for consumables if a particular fight doesn't require more of my class/role with the understanding that when it comes to farm content that I'll be considered.
---
**What I expect from your guild**: A willingness to improve and to adapt. I don't mind helping out mechanically weaker players so long as they show growth and the ability to self-reflect on mistakes. I don't want to be put in a situation where we're wiping on Baron Geddon because an officer's Significant Other just can't handle Living Bomb and they are unwilling to replace them.
---
On the flip side, I expect Guild Leadership to talk to each member one-on-one when they are struggling to help them out rather than being cold and heartless.
---
I'm open to most loot rules so long as there is a means of addressing concerns about cliquey Loot Councils. Ultimately, the more transparency there is behind your loot system, the better.
---
And *most importantly*, I expect your guild to be **FUN**. If we're going to be spending a significant amount of time together, I'd like to at least be friends with a lot of you guys. I'd hope that you guys can take a politically incorrect joke while we get corpse-camped all night between the Thorium Brotherhood flight path and Blackrock Mountain. I want in for the long haul - especially if a TBC server is eventually added.
---
**Contact me**: Either DM me here on Reddit or message me on Discord@ Leukos#7410
---
Unique buffs like increased holy damage when nobody in the raid deals holy damage except for the paladin himself?
---
I think most players know what they want, it's just that a unhappy minority will always have more to say than the people who are satisfied and Blizzard can only listen to the people who say anything. Therefore, everything looks like it needs changing and that's how, 15 years later, you have retail.
---
Your 5 year inactive reddit account that becomes active the same week that I reject your offer to purchase exclusive publishing rights to my leveling guide. Seems a bit of a coincidence. You feel spurned and have a deep personal obsession with me for some reason. It's kind of disturbing. You have to move on.
---
I remember my flame orb bugging and pulling through floors. Poison boss was a pug killer
---
Absolutely man, it felt really unique! I remember being frustrated with it at the time because I kept dying there (was the worst player of all time). But now wit's one of the areas I look back on most fondly. Searing Gorge has to be one of my favourite zones, anything around Blackrock Mountain just felt so damn epic. Three months mate... Just three more months!
---
Can technically use any spec - they aren't all in striking distance of each other in classic like they are in current games.
---
Will just have to get used to the stereotype of a "bad" spec and prove it's not trash by playing the hell out of it.
---
All comes down to personal preference, if you are someone who HAS to roll undead because other horde races don't have wotf...  that's your prerogative, min max until you stop having fun :)
---
This happened back in the day. I remember seeing the screenshots on WoWHead in 2007. After that he got buffed to just immediately one-shot anything.
---
Egan's Blaster
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13289
---
It's retail behavior.
---
Ohhhhhhh
---
People still won't want it then. By then most likely you'll have TBC Classic servers and you can play an Enhancement Shaman then. I can't imagine if this is successful they won't continue forward.
---
Oh yeah the classic get good by a random internet guy. You had to eat a lot as a rogue during vanilla leveling. Especially during tanaris phase, where grinding mob to xp was necessary. Fact.
---
Can't play on classic without an access
---
It's based on the BfA client
---
Make the addon now with retail &gt; test in the stress test coming up.
---
I showed my classic GM this and she said "sports?? what the heck?? UNACCEPTABLE!"
---
So esoteric and sophisticated. What a badass.
---
Sounds awesome. Can‚Äôt wait to play enhancement shaman now! Thank you!
---
If necessary, yes. 
---
But you shouldn‚Äôt worry about this before the realm list is even released. Worry about enjoying the game.
---
They've flat out said subscription history, account age, and other factors are taken into account. 
---
Being a streamer is clearly one of the "other factors".
---
LOL I can imagine some classic devs sitting around in the office:
---
"Hey Bill, server is getting pretty congested whats going on?"
---
G933 is what I use pretty good pair of wireless headphones
---
My ass is gonna grind so hard for the ZG tiger to make up for never getting it before Cata.
---
No true classic is the tank blames the healer&gt; healer blames dps&gt; group disbands.
---
I imagine you can just type e.g. "Healing Touch (Rank 4)" into the box, if the drag-and-drop doesn't work.  I can't test that until the next stress test, though.
---
4gig, half decent computer from the last 7 years.
---
Rogue:  
---
Pros: Very strong PvP class, easy to play well, awesome armor sets, stealth can make some questing easy.  
---
Cons: Lots of competition for gear, lots of people will be playing rogue, profession dependent, sub-par PvE dps, lots of work involved to make optimal  
---
Hunter:   
---
Pros: strong soloer, important to have in raids for some mechanical reasons (tranq shot), strong PvP options (surv / marks hybrid), less profession dependent, Easy quest epics from MC.  
---
Cons: Probably the worst ranged dps, lots of gear competition, having to use ammo, has a deadzone, did I mention lots of gear competition because you'll prolly clear BWL and still be using blue melee weapons.
---
And they should remove more. The MMO/expansion paradigm is flawed at its core. 
---
The only way to preserve the original design of 1-60, by far the deepest leveling in the game, is to make 60-70 rotate every expansion. 
---
TBC 60-70, then delete Outland and replace with Northrend 60-70, then delete Northrend and replace with Cata end zones 60-70, and vice-versa. 
---
Stacking expasions, one on top of the other like pancakes, is why catch-up mechanics and boosts and LFD are obligatory, not optional or removable. 
---
Piling on expansion content in an MMO (seriously, who the hell thought this would be sustainable?) is what led to the bloated, power creep-riddled experience we have today.
---
Is that the HP omen 32?
---
Just make sure you build a heal set too. Sometimes will be easier to pick up groups healing until you get your face melting loots and enjoy those juicy windfury pvp melt crits
---
Probably about 3-5gb and it could most likely be run on an iPad if they let it.
---
There's technically a 'dungeon' there with elites and some quests within but it's such a pain in the ass to get people for, you're better off skipping.
---
That's the equivalent of saying you should have an opinion on retail WoW 6 months after the last bit of content from the last expansion ever is released.
---
Hmmm so wouldn't skinning knives be BIS for rouges?
---
&gt;We will be using a transparent Loot Council system.
---
dafuq is that
---
Find a guild that suits you. You grow tired of a schedule you cant deal with.
---
I'm sure there will be plenty :)
---
That's just not true there's so many more factors than them just being elite. What level you are compared to them makes a tremendous difference. Leveling dungeons were for the most part really easy. The damage steps up a bit in maraudon and beyond. And elites of the same level depending on their class can hit for widely different numbers.
---
 [http://progression-annexe.blogspot.com/2016/02/videos-of-retail-sources-for-vanilla.html](http://progression-annexe.blogspot.com/2016/02/videos-of-retail-sources-for-vanilla.html)   
---
Look at the damage in those old videos and their upload dates.
---
I'm pretty certain that I'll enjoy my balls off with the game. Just wondering ;P
---
Are you actually mad that people are happy with something that many have been looking forward to?
---
How would that guaranteed translate into more viewers for the streamers if Classic wasn't actually popular? 
---
If you legitimately think that streamers are being stealth sponsored by blizzard to pretend to enjoy classic then you should report it to the FCC, because that's definitely illegal.
---
It was. They checked their values against the reference clients and they were correct.
---
Stop beating the dead horse.
---
Nobody said it‚Äôs random. Blizzard has stated that big streamers will get beta access and that they can also invite their friends/viewers.
---
&gt;Varian Wyrnn
---
this guy, is not there \^\^
---
What do they have to gain by lying about that? Do you really think it‚Äôs some grand conspiracy over damage numbers?
---
Level, PvP and Dungeon with your friends - for sure.
---
But raid on a schedule that's good for you. Maybe your friends could bring an alt along to the weekend raid?
---
So you're saying I think I do, but I don't?
---
I got a beta invite and I'm not subbed :D
---
He unironically enjoyed Legion, I don't think there's a lot going on up there.
---
does plate gear make any difference? It would be a huge power spike for warriors at that level right?
---
For the most part I agree. But the questing was certainly a strong point.
---
I personally think they should have just added all the content without ever raising the level cap from 60
---
Holy shit 
---
That's what they need to do with vanilla now, rotate xpacs up to TBC and reset levels 60-70
---
Like how PoE manages 'season' content. Except here it could maybe be a 6 month rotation instead of 3 - depending on player engagement.
---
Images of little kids shitting into a bowl provided by the fat ones mother are invading my mind...
---
I‚Äôll play what I want to play regardless, I‚Äôd just hate to have an overload of people hating on me for my spec, or having a hard time finding groups, so we can break some stereotypes for sure! 
---
I plan to roll either Tauren or Troll
---
&gt; Bonus question: new raids (also in classic) invalidates most of the gear earned previously (T2 better than T1 etc). Is is that different? 
---
Not a difference at all. This is a point I think a lot of people miss. A level increase is just another arbitrary number increase as a gear piece drop. The random thing that worked well in vanilla was the spread of items and the fact it wasn't a linear path for the gear, BiS is scattered all over the show. BC on-wards they had a more linear gear progression path.
---
Also the gear jump in BC was a little naff they got better at it in later xpacs but replacing some of that epic gear in mid level BC was weird.
---
But that's just my opinion man.
---
None of these take into account monster abilities, attack speed and if they are dual wield (attack with both hands) or two hand.
---
You would need to compare their average dps over a period of at least 30 - 60 seconds to provide any kind of real data.
---
Mid 2000s was a different time. Back then it was very immersive with an ambitious theme.
---
Because it's not an extra swing proc...
---
&gt;I was watching StaySafe almost exclusively but then one night someone said he's a well known misogynist and its been bothering me ever since.
---
??? You're the one who watches his streams. Did he ever say anything "misogynistic"? Maybe trust your own experience more than randos on the Internet.
---
&gt;(seriously, who the hell thought this would be sustainable?)
---
The developers of the most successful MMO ever?
---
Maybe this, but with the option to go to those old places instead for people who want to. It's quite an extreme solution though.
---
If he isn't a friend IRL then don't let it impact your schedule. Life is too short.
---
They wouldve needed some reason for people to play the new content though. If youre already stacked in t3, why would you ever touch a tbc 5-man?
---
In was recently remembering watching a Paladin that would do full clear runs and I couldn't remember who it was.. this was about a day or so ago! Crazy how shit like that works out, missed his videos!
---
It was in the time when MMOs were the big genre, now it's battle royals. It's not completely un-comparable.
---
I'll be travelling to Australia at end of the year, and I too would like to know if transfers will be possible so I can play here in NA and then transfer to Oceanic later... dealing with ping on either end without a transfer will be a disappointment.
---
We can talk about balancing after they produce Classic.
---
I tried that. After digging deep into old forums I found I have to create a mouse over macro and use the macro in VuhDo
---
Order 1 for me
---
One enemy lol
---
Coward
---
I'd like the ability to duplicate a character (once) to a TBC server, that way I could enjoy my gear on a classic server, and enjoy arena in TBC.
---
It was addressed in a blue post. Did you see that?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs definitely a flawed concept. Maybe in some kind of perfect world they could have balanced it in a way that all the content is at least somewhat relevant
---
I didn't say that. I said they haven't proven anything. Not sure how that confused you.
---
Just introduce him to the warlock
---
This is great to hear from preach considering that he was quite negative to the idea of classic servers a few years ago and held the think you do but you don‚Äôt attitude towards them.
---
&gt;  what's the point in playing the original game when I'm the only one doing so?
---
Because you want to ? You keep claiming that OTHERS should not use addons so you dont have to. This is ALL on you.
---
Sure
---
No new model's. Pritty much turned me off playing it, I can understand the systems but having those fugly looking models just seems like a petty thing to keep. I didn't spend 2 grand in a gaming pc to see that orcs face..... Ewwww.
---
Easier alternative, yes. Braindead easy though? It was never like that. WotLK was the death of difficulty. I still vividly remember feeling like I was stupidly OP while leveling my Hunter the day that expansion launched...for the first time in WoW history I was questing and pulling 3, 4, 5, 6 mobs and having no real issues. 
---
Then we hit the Heroics and on day one of dinging 80, we'd cleared pretty much every single dungeon on Heroic mode.
---
Then we walked into Naxxramas, and on the first week we almost finished the entire zone on 10 man difficulty.
---
Difficulty helps create social bonds in MMOs. The game has to be hard enough to push people together and give you a strong incentive in finding other good players who you can count on and enjoy playing with. Once that trap gets sprung on you...you're hooked into the game. You've got a network of players who know you and will be sending you msgs on Battle.net asking you to get online and play some WoW.
---
Shiny new loot, cool new zones, class overhauls, it's all cool stuff. But it all wears off after a while, leading you to unsub. It's the people who keep you coming back online night after night. No matter what the content is, you'll all find ways to enjoy it together.
---
Boredom is a hell of a drug. Folks will find things to do.
---
You'll see shenanigans all the time; Kiting named elites, crossroads/southshore PvP, IF/Org gate duels, erp ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) , etc
---
And that's separate from the *core* gameplay - Leveling alts, leveling professions, playing the Auction House, doing dungeons, raids on alts, helping guildies, farming gold, etc etc. 
---
Once the content phases are completed - and folks feel like they have beaten the game - Bliz will likely announce their future plans. My guess is 'Classic Season 2' (fresh servers) and a tease for Burning Crusade servers.
---
Ion has talked all along that they expect a large drop of players after a little while, so they are keeping a smaller amount of servers and then using the "layering" tech to expand the population of those servers to a usable amount. So yeah, they're trying to avoid dead servers and servers being abandoned by keeping a small list
---
I want WOW, not Diablo damn it.
---
&gt;Loot:  
---
&gt; Loot council rewarding those who preform. If you are at the top of the meters you will be rewarded.
---
That's kind of circular reasoning.   You have better gear, so you win the dmg meter, so you  get better gear, thus winning by even more.  
---
This also disregards the fact that some classes can't compete with others.  Vanilla's class balance is a bad joke.
---
Someone call Stratholme, she's crying.
---
I don't remember this being a thing, honestly.
---
Don't stress it. If you are amazing at a bad build you will still be better than 90% of players no matter their build.
---
This is the big plus for me going back into Classic. It's been so long since I've played through the old zones that I think it will feel new, not to mention all the old quests that were wiped.
---
It's fun for me to have hundreds of other people running around the same zone dicking around and having a good time, yes. **That's why it's called an MMO.** You should go play Ass Creed or something to get your gaming fix if the presence of other people annoys you so much.
---
It still boggles my mind that Blizzard made their game anti-social af to appease people like you. **And they are going to make the same mistake again is what kills me.**
---
For End Game, if you plan to Raid with your Rogue, then Herbalism with Alchemy is a good combination as you can supply your own Flasks and Potions.
---
Elitism is hard to exist in classic I would imagine.
---
Raids are not hard. Anybody who gives a good effort will clear all of them and get geared. Pvp is not a skill test - it's a time test. The game will be strictly community driven by late nights at goldshire, world pvp, city raids etc with raid nights and pvp to fill the void. 
---
Toxicity always exists, people make a name out of it. I'm not too worried about it though.
---
Quit your job as every sane guy would.
---
The server is always the authority in determining whether things happen or not. So for in this example, whether or not Stabbers can hit Perp is ultimately up to what the server sees. The reason why Stabber's latency doesn't matter is because it can only make it worse for him (Stabbers), but not Perp. The bigger latency he has, then the longer it takes to update his position to the server. 
---
If you've ever played with high ping, then you might have run into the scenario where you're right behind the target on your screen but it keeps saying you're out of range. This is because it doesn't matter what you see on your screen at all. On the server, that person is 5 yards ahead of you and all you're seeing is his position x latency in the past.
---
So back to this example. The higher latency Perp has then the farther back he is on the server -- meaning the closer he is to Stabbers who is trailing him. How Perp sees (Perp's client perspective) his Stabbers is exactly how the server is interpreting Stabber's movement. Again, Stabbers could have 500ms and be literally right on top of him on his screen. It wouldn't matter though since the server is seeing where Stabbers is 500ms in the past. Wherever the server sees Stabbers is what is ultimately sent to Perp as well. Perp will always see 110ms (or w/e his latency is) in the past, but he will always see what the server just calculated.
---
[I made this image to help visualize with my pro paint skills.](https://i.imgur.com/HPZPpqy.jpg) Everything in red is what the server sees and what ultimately matters. Perp's perspective (blue) and Stabbers perspective (green) don't ultimately matter.
---
Sorry if that doesn't make sense. I'm pretty tired right now. TLDR is that clients are giant fucking liars and the server is ultimately what determines whether something is in range.
---
Nah we remember right.   A good smooth run even at 60 you'd want two CC per group or you'd get wrecked because of the damage they did.
---
Specs will be a little more than original vanilla I'm assuming (based on it being modern client &amp; engine, but with downscaled options). But yeah, basically any half decent computer from the last many years will do plenty fine.
---
Spells are not delayed tho
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted. At the moment, UnitCastingInfo and UnitChannelInfo don't exist, and their respective Classic versions take no arguments and only return values for the player. In addition, even though there is CLEU, there is no event fired when a player (or mob) cancels a cast themselves.
---
The only way I can think of to effectively go sideways would be if we were adventuring in I dunno "The Elemental Plains" or some such where resistance was the target, moving from fire to wind to water to earth etc. you could conceivably have the core gear stats relatively the same but the resistances on the gear is what you needed to get to advance in a new area?   
---
Something like that. But otherwise side progression is usually just look at my new pretty colours. Bam Green sword, Bam pink Sword, Bam orangutan hat.

will demand for leather be very high? seems like lots of people will take up skinning but not many take up leatherworking
---
Well, that's interesting.  I wonder if that's a limitation of the API or just the addon.  I only started using a healing addon in TBC (Healbot) and it worked like I mentioned above.
---
think you tripping bro, never remember anything like that happening
---
Everything in Classic as a feral druid is a clusterfuck IMO. I main feral since the end of WotLK, and all the little QoL they integrated to the spec over the years make me hate feral in vanilla. It‚Äôs a shame that I feel that way, because the community aspect of Classic is what I miss from WoW. Not the old clunky mechanics.
---
But don't you need lv35 at least to learn the high level recipies?
---
So not really a lv1 bank alt...
---
At this point it seems obvious that the problem is somewhere between crit damage, glancing strikes, attack speed or mitigation being wrong. Especially the scaling on higher level mobs.
---
Hands down my favorite classic content creator so far.
---
Or just a paladin or warlock with friends :)
---
To be fair there are things you can do in Classic that have rules or infact have been made unfun on Retail. For Example, They can graveyard camp for 40+ minutes in WSG on Live there's a 20 minute timer on the battle.
---
prolly thinking of hollows end
---
Modern raid design with a vanilla game design philosophy would be TIGHT. Hopefully the interest in classic will make Blizzard reassess some decisions they made in the past. Maybe implement non-sharded, non-lfg, realms for retail?

Cool, wiping the group is definitely a good thing to do.
---
What is wrong with you. I am in a guild, I group up for world quests, I raid, I do dungeons, I do wpvp, I like having competition for mobs. 
---
What I don't like is waiting 5 minutes at a mobspawn over and over.
---
Btw, you do know that the first server launches weren't that crowded, that is only a 'new servers being added' and private server thing. So where is your purism here?

‚ÄúThe most successful species ever?‚Äù
---
Snarkiness aside, it‚Äôs so seductive to follow that easy route of just letting expansions hang off the game like a rotting tumor, that no other MMOs have tried to solve expansion content a different way. 
---
Except for sandbox MMOs, which are a different breed from theme park MMOs. So, for example, EVE Online doesn‚Äôt have this problem. But it‚Äôs a sandbox. Its expansions don‚Äôt ‚Äúadd levels‚Äù or expand the universe in a divergent way. 
---
Other MMOs, like Realm of the Mad God, add expansion content *horizontally.* Because RotMG is a perma-death MMO with a ‚ÄúPrestige‚Äù system, they can add all sorts of extra content with little fear of power creep and content-deprication. 
---
But theme park MMOs? None have figured it out. Even FF XIV finally introduced quest-skipping items and XP-boosters. 
---
*Just fucking replace the content, or put it on a seasonal cycle.* Even if each season is a couple years long.
---
they can not solo farm any instance (even at 60) with mob levels &gt; 50

you will struggle with mob levels &gt;45

---
It is yes :)
---
I think 5 levels increments were fine. It's kinda ironic that they used to give just 5 levels/expansion for some time. Then they changed it back to 10 levels/expansion. And at same time they are talking about possible level squish because max level is too high..
---
choir (sorry)
---
Yea this is an interesting point.  I met people farming Ashran for Warlord of Draenor when we were still allowed to queue as raids.  We'd sort the raid into groups for what race people needed to kill.  It was a real community feeling, same 35-40 people together for 6+ hours working towards a goal together, made me realize how much I missed that.
---
Halloween when the headless horseman comes around. Don't remember if that was vanilla or not though. I never did the events beyond food
---
What's bad about Civ6? Me and my brother have played the Civ games since Civ 1. I quit after Civ 5 (rip) but my brother plays Civ 6 and loves it.
---
A friend of mine suggested crafting alterations. Essentially instead of replacing T2/T3 in an expansion, a player would run content to deconstruct new gear into mats to eventually re-forge the T2/T3 into BiS pre-raid gear for the following expansion.
---
&gt; Dungeon Finder? It‚Äôs the only way to enter a dungeon from three expansions ago while leveling
---
It is certainly not. You can walk into any dungeon, or get summoned on a summoning stone. The other issues is that no one actually does it, since there's LFG that rewards you *extra* for using it.
---
I‚Äôm completely opposite on this
---
You'll need to download the client for wow classic. 
---
You can reserve up to three names, two weeks before release, assuming you have an active subscription. 
---
You don't need to buy anything - Just be subscribed to wow and you can play Classic.
---
DK style taking :P
---
Most of your questions are answered here: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
Make sure you have a Battle.Net account and the B.Net launcher installed.  You should be able to download the client in advance sometime around Aug. 13th.
---
1. Just have the Battle.NET client installed and logged in
---
2. The servers go online UTC 10PM August 26, that's 3PM Pacific or Midnight (Aug 27th) in Europe.
---
3. You'll be able to make 3 characters on August 12th.
---
4. You need to pay the monthly subscription to play (and to pre-make your 3 characters).
---
That's probably the aspect it'll impact the least as your pet and kiting skills allow for great control over your enemy's position.
---
It'll be weird in pvp but more melee range can also be a good thing I reckon?
---
Are you confusing TukUI with ElvUI? They share the same website and discord and such, but TukUI is (as you already know) very usable, I haven't played beta without it. ElvUI has a repo where the only thing publicly visible is a vague outline of changes necessary for Classic lol.
---
I disagree with your post so strongly but it's midnight and I'm on mobile so I don't want to go into detail why atm.
---
Wow lost over 3 million subs when cata launched... Your argument is null. No game loses millions of players in the span of a few months because of "time". They done fucked up wow and made it a shitty game...just accept it:. Modern wow is Haute Garb√†ge.
---
Maybe they think it's correct but there's some unknown error somewhere. Best people keep digging just in case. This is what the beta is for.
---
&gt;I will feign death + frost trap macro.
---
And the rogue uses his Skull with chicken noises and /laugh at you for even trying that.
---
Install the Battlenet client, you'll be able to download the game on release there. There might even be a pre download before release.
---
Scroll down here for release info.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
You can pre-create your character on the 13th of August. This, will likely also include a download of the game, and when the server names will be released.
---
You'll just need your battlenet account with your wow account linked and pay the 15$ subscription,this will give you access to wow classic and retail.
---
I loved this add-on. Used it for all of vanilla. Still have the add-on saved on an external harddrive
---
It would be a real missed opportunity if they didn't, it would definitely build the hype going into release. 30 is fun but is getting a bit old now, it won't last another 2 months. 40 would be awesome to see with STV levelling, buying mounts fuelling the economy and people unlocking 31pt talents.
---
__Deadmines is a level 20 dungeon. Dire Maul, the one OP was reffering to isn't.__
---
Did you watch the video?
---
Uhhh feign removes you from the agro table
---
So depending on when you release you should be fine
---
If you feign and get back up then get healed or ur dot tics....No
---
But how it will pan out after layering is removed?
---
This is something ive been shouting since late wrath when lfd dropped in. 
---
I feel so goddamn vindicated right now. This is the best feeling ever :')
---
Stay in school
---
&gt; BfA is something that has been out for awhile.
---
While classic has been out, in one form for another on private servers for what... 15 years? lol
---
No, there should also be these flight points: LH Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands, 1 common both Alliance and Horde in Searing Gorge and 2 in Burning Steppes. That should be it I think.
---
After over a decade I would love to see someone revive it for classic. You should share the old addon folders if possible, I haven‚Äôt been able to find them anywhere. Might be that someone out there can get it working!
---
Raiding is just a smart part of the game, do it on a schedue that fits. Every other aspect of the game can be done with friends.
---
I bought my 6 month sub at release. Then they announced the boat, carefully timing it so that anyone who did so at launch would have to buy another 6 months. I said fuck that. :D
---
 Grocery? A REAL MAN buys his grocerys @ lunch to not miss any game time after work.  Gym is important for your health and wellbeing though, so keep that up. But do 1 month of 15-20 min shorter  workouts.
---
Priest here
---
It‚Äôs not hard to understand why they thought this would be fine. When they first created this game, they weren‚Äôt thinking 7 expansion packs down the line. They probably realized that this model was doomed to fail eventually, which is why they tried to revamp pre-60 content with Cata, but the players weren‚Äôt interested at all. All the players cared about at this point is endgame content, and there was a ton of backlash about Cata. After that, they decided to just go back to their old philosophy and just ride it out.
---
WoW has been out for almost 15 years as a subscription based MMO, and has set a ton of subscription method. No other MMO (and rarely and video games) have that kind of longevity; it is easy to see why Blizzard wasn‚Äôt thinking over a decade ahead when WoW was in production.
---
Depending on the class it doesn't really work, since the fishing pole doesn't count as a weapon, so you can't use weapon skills with it.
---
Google used to have a free survey thing, maybe check if that's still around...
---
I remembered that in the "old days", the actual Leveling Experience is the main content for Casuals and it can taken them 1-2 years to reach level 60. Quite often, once they reached 60, they just start another new character to experience it all over again from another perspective. 
---
Once a Guild good a Raid on Farm, they usually PUG a few Casuals in to experience the raid and even get them a few epic upgrades if none of the Raiders needed the gear. 
---
The Vanilla Experience offers something for everyone and let's not forget, this is the original game that launched the success of WOW and is still the benchmark for MMOs. I think it was a mistake by Blizzard to obsolete this Content and funneled everyone into end-game raiding.
---
We got this question here everyday. Everyday the awnser is no.
---
But in 3 years... who knows.
---
No my argument isn‚Äôt null. Because I never said it didn‚Äôt have bad expansions. And the fact you said that makes me think you barely read what I said or don‚Äôt understand. A bad expansion doesn‚Äôt automatically make the game end forever, it can rebound. But if interest dies down due to time, it can never rebound.
---
Which well it did. FTPs do everything but community and Raiding better than Classic and WoW. Which is why Modern WoW is the way it is. They have to make Raiding the best thing possible. Because they can‚Äôt compete on any other front. They are trying to add more stuff like M+ but with how Blizzard acts, I can see DFO or Warframe stepping up to the plate and destroying Blizzard in the M+ department.
---
You‚Äôre not understanding. In WotLK, when Dungeon Finder was introduced, it was not because people were too lazy to fly to a dungeon. 
---
It‚Äôs because 1-80 finally split the leveling population so thinly on every server, across multiple, disconnected continents, that the chances of you getting four other people to run Sethekk Halls because they were in the same place at around the same level was *nigh impossible.*
---
Everyone was off in Northrend, doing the endgame content or if they were leveling, now they were diluted across too much content. 
---
Dungeon Finder was essentially cross-realm queue. Key word being *cross-realm.*
---
The story was less "You are the amazing champion" and more "You are the helpful adventurer" which I prefer.
---
No mention of ma boi Hogger?
---
Please don't defragment your SSD.
---
No, especially for early leather. Rugged ans thick can be used to make green so there will be but it won't be worth it on a fresh server. The thing is, you can just vendor your leather, it's steady income that makes getting your mount at 40 a formality if you're not stupid with your gold management.
---
And if you are an engeneer and use jumper cables. You might be able to ress a guy who can ress the rest.
---
Its good. We get it. You want to save buffs and repairs.
---
You think you do, and you do.
---
What the fuck are you talking about.  He has always supported classic wow, he just thought it wasn't for him
---
Hunter.
---
But you will miss 90% of the fun if you treat this game as a solo game.
---
This is not retail.
---
If its only for pve i would suggest alch/herb.
---
This just isn't true especially for enhancement. You will not be allowed to use storm strike for ones same goes for frost shock. You have to wait longer to dps sins unlucky wf procs early in encounters will wipe the raid. As an enhancement you will not do top 25 damage you will do raid worst damage. If you are lucky you will do 50% of tank damage. But sure you can bring an enhancement to raids you can also raid as 39 ppl and clear content. Any other class and spec will have it easier to get a raid spot and they will probably outperform enhancement by miles aswell
---
He went on to make a point that it's impossible to cater to everyone. Person A want x feature, person B wants y feature, Person C wants z feature, but none of them agree with each other. So what the best solution? No changes
---
I tought it was a real add at first. I was even considering buying one.
---
I think they should save the level 60 content for the internal Alpha testing honestly.
---
Release, quickly leveling to 60, completing the first Strat dead, UBRS attunement, Ony, Molten Core, etc. That hype train is going to be insane.
---
They should save that hype for release, I think.
---
That being said -- Bliz should absolutely test the lv60 content in the alpha.
---
 **ENFP-T** , played Warlock in the past (and at that time probably would have filled out many things differently, to get very different personality type!). Now main will be Hunter, with Priest alt possible.
---
Blizzard has never said they were random. They specifically said they use a number of factors to determine who gets an invite.
---
FYI, the server max pop was 'dynamic' they would tweak it the default starting value was 2/2.5K but late Vanilla/BC period it was usually around the 3.5K mark.
---
im taking to an idiot
---
Hey man, I'll use whatever I get for my first pair of shoulder armor, and if its leather, then so be it.
---
Not him, but he never mentioned anything about stealth sponsoring. Also side note, the game is clearly going to boom in the initial period and everyone knows this. Even if the bandwagon deters, you've already cashed in from the boom. Plus, it's only natural you do this as an entertainer, regardless of whether you enjoy or not enjoy it. Your job is supposed to be where the money is at. Why would you be making content for retail wow when you can make content for classic wow in it's initial boom?
---
I subbed for a chance to play beta and it worked, I'd rather win an actual lottery though tbh
---
"Limited rotation"
---
Rogue has as limited of a rotation, dont you worry. If thats such a big deal to you, skip classic.
---
Would be a cool idea. I don‚Äôt think they would remove LFR though. It‚Äôs slightly better than watching the raid on YouTube, and with them forcibly shoving titanforging down our throats and catch up I think if they leave anything it will be LFR.
---
Flip side though I would be all for those being removed if you can make a group like you do for M+ and just que up for LFR with the group like in Arenas. Or walk to the LFR person like you do to farm MoP raids.
---
Same with me but there is not a working version of healbot for the beta atm
---
Hunter and Lock
---
Dwarfs are in no way in no universe the suprior choice when it cools to visuals.
---
It seems blizzard wants to remove all the bugs but most don't have a problem with that. I'm all for as orginal as possible because vanilla was always my favorite version of the game but just because people prefer small changes doesn't mean they want to ruin it for other people.
---
The Paladin and Warlock epic mount quests required materials that were more expensive than just buying a regular Epic Mount.
---
Project 30 incoming.
---
It's fine as long as they aren't drawing the fight on minutes longer after every wipe.
---
First 10? You realize the first 10 points are huge for a warrior tank right? reduce rage cost of heroic strike by 3 points, 2% more parry chance, and tactical mastery so you can stance dance effectively from level 17
---
it is a real ad - it appeared on my Facebook feed
---
That sounds like it. And most the seasonal events didn't come out until darkmoon was becoming a thing. from what I can remember. Might be off on somethin tho.
---
I absolutely agree. And the funny part is, the devs tell us this *all the time!*
---
There are plenty of presentations and Q&amp;As where some dev jokingly says something along the lines of: ‚Äúand how will [current expansion mechanic] work after [current expansion]? That‚Äôs a future-us problem!‚Äù
---
Of course they didn‚Äôt realize that all these band-aids for bloat, like LFG and Boosts and XP-buffs would end up ruining the core experience. But now we know. There must be another way. 
---
Allowing us to completely skip entire chunks of leveling content was another band-aid. My radical solution is to stop these half-asses methods and *cut them out completely* and return the 1-60 pacing and world as the primarly leveling experience
---
Realm, faction, and name changes will almost certainly be a thing. Blizzard wants that money.
---
I ment directed at me. Since every add is 'personalized'.  If they have it in Horde edition I'll buy one.
---
I never thought about that
---
This is a big one for me. I will be very disappointed if they don't have this server option at launch.
---
Shit, I used to gloat when I survived like that.
---
I think were all adults at this point...
---
What happened to the dragon.
---
Hunter is already one of the most hated classes by the community soo.. why not keep fulfilling that expectation?
---
It's true, though.
---
You're actually right that in particular the idea of just stacking levels on top of each other is unsustainable. It absolutely is, and doing a level reset each expansion does that very well really.
---
There's not a particular reason though to delete previous expansion's content. I typically would recommend downscaling expansion content as a new option to level through in the 1-60 experience. Where specifically depends on the tone of the individual expansion. It should be an option, but it also shouldn't be obvious its an option on first playthrough to keep most players on the evergreen content.
---
Sustainability has absolutely been the bane of WoW's existence from the beginning. It's why talent trees were removed too. It's why abilities were pruned. It's why number crunches have had to exist. WoW should've had a serious sustainability plan for going forward made by 2010, but they didn't catch it and so much of the game is crumbling, broken, or pointless.
---
Why is that?
---
Harder on pservers that‚Äôs why it has that rep
---
Start with gnomish engenering and craft every item. These are all items that don't break. Later on swao to Goblin so you cab still make the Sappers.
---
You will keep all crafted items since they are Bind of Pickup, but don't recuire Gnomish to wear.
---
I know it‚Äôs not exactly the same, but I just started playing on a private server instead. I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs that much different to justify the effort to try to get into beta.
---
Can you still run Nax?
---
Pilav
---
This.
---
As far as Kara goes, im 100% against a copy pasted TBC Kara with Vanilla damage/hp values. It would feel like when they took Naxx out of Plaguelands and plopped it into Northrend. It feels cheap, the mechanics aren't really intended for Vanilla class/spec capabilities, etcetera. 
---
HOWEVER, I would 100% *love* a raid or 5-man based off the old assets. Whether thats the Alpha version of Kara that never saw the light of day, or actually making use of the Crypts, I think those are much less awkward solutions than just plopping TBC Kara in.
---
Tidal charm I don't remember ever using (only trying out Linken's Boomerang) but the rez trinket was fun, that I can confirm.
---
For difficulty we still have PvP, Raiding and M+. The only difficulty we really lost was open world. 
---
Also WOTLK was the highest playerbase numbers and it tanked in a subpar expansion after and then kept dropping because of ‚ÄúLoL Pandas‚Äù. We saw WoD hit WOTLK numbers for a bit before everyone went ‚ÄúWait this expansion is shit‚Äù. Though I doubt they woulda all stayed due to Battleroyals and MOBAs being the WoW of today. 
---
And legion got a boost, no idea how much though because WoD was bad enough that they stopped announcing numbers.
---
Also Most people hate Class overhauls. The only time people want them is when their class was destroyed from the previous overhaul. Warlocks still are pissed about losing MoP warlock.
---
In fact most will be happy to explain the mechanics to you and likely wont get mad if you fuck it up a bit as long as you make an effort to get better. In retail with no communication if you end up in a dungeon you havent done before some people are quick to kick you rather than wipe once and explain what you did wrong. I don't think it will be like that in classic. The very nature of the game makes you slow it down some, you cant just reque and replace someone in 2 minutes.
---
IMO, I think your plan would have some similar problems to retail.
---
If each expansion was only lvl 60-70, there would be a congregation of players at lvl 60. This would kill the 1-60 leveling experience, requiring things like LFD, RAF, etc. to help new players' experiences.
---
Not sure if never getting getting to use my 2 best damage abilities because of debuffs. Using all my mana on twisting and probably using the same weapon for the entirety of the game (nightfall) counts as bringing something special. And the ap buff on windfury is not that grate it is only on the actually proc so it will not change the dps of the warrior by much.
---
It was kind of a half zone really, lots of running for a few levels with hordies all around. Still worth it if you wanted to quest in Desolace. I never liked to skip content anyway.
---
Im pretty sure I had to go up the ramp near darkcloud pinnacle, along the little bridges, that eventually leads to the Razorfen Downs pre-instance area, and then I just go through there and hook into Barrens.
---
Big if true.
---
&gt; The ghost walk is horrid.  
---
Just don't die
---
I mean they have broached the subject of a level squish, allowing return to a 1-60 experience without killing the option to experience the majority of wow history
---
Also catch-up mechanics &amp; power creep are intentional for the skinner box that is retail. Regardless of expansions they want to make sure people feel 1) they can hop in any season, &amp; 2) they can get meaningful upgrades in *this* tier. Right or wrong, those design choices are independent of their expansions paradigm
---
I completely agree. Blizzard will see this soon enough if vanilla becomes successful.
---
I'm not strictly opposed to balancing, but I feel like there's not really a good consensus on what balance is. Different classes and specs are good at very different things, and are often kinda incomparable.
---
The best example is Hunters vs. Warriors. Hunters are optimised for solo play, they can solo kill mobs that nobody else can even touch, they're not super dependent on gear, they're amazing at 1v1 PvP and ganking, and they're easy to level. Warriors are kinda the opposite, they suck by themselves but with top level gear and a supporting raid they become the best in the game, they're basically optimised for raiding and premade PvP.
---
This is a kind of balance, and I think it's valuable to have different classes and specs be good at different areas of the game like this (though I don't think the game is perfectly balanced even with that taken into account.) However, if a player only really cares about one or two game areas (e.g. raiding and organised PvP) then the game is going to appear incredibly unbalanced, because they place a high value on the Warrior's strengths, but a low value on the Hunter's.
---
This isn't to say the game is perfectly balanced, it isn't, but maintaining class/spec niches and mechanical differentiation is really hard. This is why modern WoW originally went the way of homogenisation, and thus why so many people are afraid of balance patches.
---
I mean sure it will have less tools than what it has on mop.. but that doesnt mean i wont find fun out of the game.. hell  league is fun for me even though it only has 4 skills. Its about skill ceiling.. high skill floor high reward that makes it fun
---
Dude, looking at your history and you seem to be triggered far more than actual Asmon fanboys. It's like you're dedicated to hating on Asmon, it's ironic and hillarious.
---
You think you don't, but you do.
---
I am still amazed how many dumb customers there are, who throw money on these shady business models. Guess how many gonna prepaid their account in August, just to reserve a name, subscribing to a service they are not using.
---
Uhm, i find that the amount of fun is quite subjective. Your statement is volatile and fanboyed.
---
Also Asmongold wanted to take ransom from people to kite it away
---
They changed ZG 1 week before my Tiger would drop. Im still salty.
---
Alch / herb is really good for making money. Engineering is really good for pvp. One of my favorite ways of farming money is to do rfd runs, where i pickpocket the majority of the mobs and pick all the grave moss. It‚Äôs a really solid gold per hour to get your epic mount as soon as possible.
---
You can also camp lotus spawns quite easily as a rogue with your stealth.
---
I'm pretty sure blizzard have started that current values are correct.
---
Small correction. All players care about, or have ever cared about, is playing whatever the majority of other people are playing. Today it's endgame content because leveling is so incredibly fast that nobody with more than a couple hours of gametime per week is still below the level cap.
---
The Cataclysm revamp failed because it misdiagnosed the problem. New players weren't abandoning WoW because the pre-60 leveling content was bad (though it arguably was inferior to what followed), but because nobody else was playing it. The vast majority of the active playerbase was playing the latest expansion. Revamping low level questing content, while appreciated, treated the symptoms rather than the problem.
---
Vanilla and BC didn't have nearly as big of a problem because new players were still constantly piling into the game, so there was always a sufficient population in the low level zones to get that living MMO feel.
---
So ultimately the best thing Blizzard did wasn't cutting old content, it was providing the free level boosts with expansion purchases so that new/returning players could be where the majority of players were, experiencing that living MMO.
---
I know what you mean but I can see classic servers dying or going relatively dead if tbc opens. Personally I love tbc and that‚Äôs when I started playing but I‚Äôm wary of classic tbc being released without a decent plan to keep vanilla servers alive
---
what QoL stuff does it add for pve?
---
I agree, but thoses informations aren't available natively from the game which mean it's how it should have been played during Vanilla = taking care the whole fight about threat = lower damage the whole fight and take care about the few mechanics during the boss fight.
---
I'm not asking #NoAddons just wondering if in the end it's not gonna be Classic + retail QoL througt addons.
---
Logician...
---
Yep, sounds about right.^^
---
This trinket is OP PvP PvE until AQ 40 extreme TC about SV Agi Arp Spec..
---
Agree - I hope we don‚Äôt seem streamers play 60 content in our faces for a month before release
---
Really looking for the Atlas would love that
---
Apparently someone extremely boring.
---
Yeah that would be interesting. It would keep the wsg and Arathi more full too
---
Or Closed Beta under NDA (so they can get more eyes on it, but streaming or sharing info/screenshots from it is legally actionable.)
---
$360 I plan to play for at least 2 years.
---
Yes a lot of people don't realize this but this could be the only chance to play wow at such a unique angle.
---
People though cata was only an half expansion because it only increased max lvl by 5.
---
After the WoD failure i can't blame them for increasing the lvl by 10, it helped into making legion launch a success
---
I like how he just assumes you didn't report a obvious bug from a 15 second clip of the bug that you posted here yourself to showcase the bug.
---
The dungeons were some of the best 5man content we've ever had. I have so many great memories of pugging Ozruk. It also proved that the lack of dungeon difficulty was a bigger problem than rdf. People started communicating again and would stick around after several wipes. I quit after they nerfed the dungeons.
---
I had an add on that I used in Vanilla when playing on my hunter. Every time my aimed shot had a crit, it screamed out that quote ‚ÄùBoom headshot!!‚Äù
---
It's happened in other mmorpgs and has always been more popular than whatever the most recent expansion/version the main game is running.
---
But isn't that what people complain about dungeons now? It's all just massive aoe pulls. 
---
We heard it here first people hobbs killed wow.
---
I actually think it would be awesome if Blizzard did this type of thing for years. Just keep opening servers with odd restrictions, leave it open for exactly one month, and then start a new one with something different.
---
And it doesn't have to based around the level cap. Maybe on one server you buff the mob damage to 200%, another server is a free for all, a third server has mobs chase you indefinitely until one of you dies. I don't know, but I think it would super fun and keep the game fresh for a very long time.
---
ESTP-A? Does that just mean im an asshole?
---
Yeah it would be good to have choice. I‚Äôm worried about population split causing classic servers to stagnate. And if they release tbc what‚Äôs stopping them from wrath and then cata etc? Then the populations would split even more. That‚Äôs why I hope he level is capped at 60 and new content is released that fits the vanilla wow meta. 
---
It‚Äôs a complex issue with so many possibilities and no real best choice
---
You get more xp per mob/quest at higher levels though
---
Theres actually a version of vanilla that has balanced hybrids but enchacement shammys still suck. Its called BFA 4headdddddddddddddd
---
That does really annoy me.  Calling modern WoW "retail" implies that it is the real, legitimate, purchased version and we're playing some bootleg, unauthorized version.  There is Modern and there is Classic.
---
Nah he just fishes a lot
---
I mean, you‚Äôre not wrong, and in my past comments I‚Äôm even more extreme, just like you‚Äôve indicated!
---
I‚Äôve ranted on this sub plenty about how obscene it is to have an MMO where the endgame is *disconnected* from leveling. 
---
1-60 is a holistic, cohesive experience precisely because level 60s inhabit the same areas as levels 10s. 
---
TBC was a *huge* step back in that regard. 
---
I don‚Äôt believe you could ever add an expansion to an MMO world that was not designed with that future content in mind. This is why I‚Äôm against adding more content to Vanilla, even if its in the world. It would throw off the purposeful design of the original game. 
---
My actual, extreme solution? Every ‚Äúexpansion‚Äù must be its own, integral, separate game, with its own complete, cohesive, holistic, 1-60 experience.
---
Same and same, I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll be rolling though.
---
Hobbs is the OG vanilla legend, smh
---
Because of its cast animation my favorite use for this is to bait out a counterspell / interrupt in PvP!    
---
Wont work in higher ranks &amp; high premades but for casual BG's and world PvP it served me very well.    
---
Nothing was as satisfying as eating a counterspell on Furbolg Form then free casting heals haha.
---
I quit shortly after LFR was introduced. It ruined the raiding experience for me :(
---
I think they should be in for the first phase, or the first two if blizz are that concerned about hurting our feelings. We don't need to be told how to play the game and the mounts aren't going to stop people from rushing anyway.
---
Since we're getting progressive content the mounts should be available.
---
I read your post in full. Ik what you're trying to say but the data just doesn't agree with you. There is an exact moment you can pin point that wow began its descent... Year after year, each expansion making the game shittier and shittier and it continues to lose millions of players. That doesn't happen because of "lack of interest" are you kidding?
---
WoW is the most commercially successful mmo to have ever existed, even after all these years like you said it still has one of the highest populations. It's brand equity is off the charts (people are literally refuse to quit because they are so loyal to it. Other brands wish they could achieve that.)
---
And YET... They somehow managed to fuck it all up. They deviated so far from what the game was supposed to be in the span of a few weeks with the release of cata that gave the player base whiplash and millions left soon after. They doubled down on the design philosophies that drove people away because it's what the whiny players wanted, they catered to the casuals to gain maximum profit.... Their mistake? They had no back up plan.
---
This has happened to countless games, so often it should have its own term or something. The game starts off as a deep, engaging and immersive experience with challenges and interesting gameplay but then the company wants more money so they try to reahh the biggest audience they can and so they have to sacrifice depth/challenge in favour of ease/simplicity. The only problem is that casual players move on and then the company is left with a bleeding game and no long term plan.
---
And I agree with you; raiding is all modern wow has. It literally cannot do anything else because if it tries to, the player base will whine and whine about having to actually play the game to get rewards. That's the risk you take when you pander to the largest market any game can reach. You can't start making it actually engaging again oh no no no, it's gonna spiral until it's literally as easy as a mobile game. Look at what theyve done to classes in the last 3 expansions; pruned to hell and back to the point where none of the classes are interesting or have any flavour... that's the goal.
---
So I agree with parts of your argument, but I do not agree that the reason wow has been declining is due to "time" and lack of "interest". WoW has been on a steady decline ever since they made those sweeping changes in cataclysm, killing off what little of the original game was left and so the players left in turn. Making a game as easy as possible is, as it turns out, not a good idea for the long term.
---
It's the same as it ever was, as above mentioned blizzard have confirmed the numbers. This is just another difference in classic wow than vanilla, you're not noobs anymore. You interrupt, pop defensives, wear your actual armour rather than mix and match for different stats.
---
Vanilla really wasnt as hard as people think, we just didn't know what we were doing back in the day in comparison.
---
Very neat, I like the sound of a mini conversion mod where you have the Azeroth races in there, and 'true start' locations for the laughs. Now how do we mod the game to make that mountain in Teldrassil a giant ass tree.
---
Absolutely! It‚Äôs crazy to think that there‚Äôs a whole meta, pages and pages of information about best items to have at this level and in a few months it will be completely irrelevant and most likely never explored again. Enjoy this while you can lads!!
---
You misspelled amphetamine
---
Oh the irony
---
How did you measure the fun people have playing BFA and how did you measure it for the beta?
---
Can you show us your results?
---
At least you will be appreciated.
---
Like, a vending machine that works, those you don‚Äôt need to kick to get the item out of.
---
Agreed, imo the most beautiful zone in the game.
---
&gt; I would much prefer layering in retail
---
According to developers, part of the problem with this is that over the years they've baked in many systems level changes to the game in accordance with the constraints sharding creates.
---
For example, player abilities are (purportedly) more demanding of netcode than in vanilla. Even if they weren't, classes in vanilla perform actions far more infrequently. Spell-batching as a system violates the experience of many casuals, who will interpret a variety of actions as less tactile or laggier.
---
Layering takes advantage of the lower demand of classic inherently because higher player density is less of a concern. The technology is not bijectively portable to retail.
---
&gt; But there are elements of classic that would be so good in retail.
---
As in the above example, there are many design decisions that the developers cannot undo, or that they would have to find a way to slowly undo over the course of 2-3 expansions. If classes suddenly performed half as many actions it would violate the experience that many retail players (myself not included) value. As much as I dislike the design of retail, it's also not reasonable to give a middle finger to a huge portion of your audience who you've built over the course of a decade.
---
If it makes you feel any more confident, I'm in the same boat as you are. I missed the WoW hype train when it released, and didn't get a chance to hop in, and soon lost interest. Never found the retail WoW to be exciting either.  
---
Now with classic releasing, I'm excited to try it out, especially with all the people praising its meaningful progress regarding levels and gear. So if there are even more like-minded people like us, we probably won't feel too ashamed to be the noobs learning the ropes\~
---
I remember doing trying to do Ony attune in a day or 2 and I stayed up so long doing it that i actually fell asleep in the middle of one of the dungeons
---
Shut up retard. We are the ones actually testing the game and trying to make a faithful authentic recreation. You bootlickers would eat up anything so go back to BFA.
---
Hope you get caught and banned. You're the reason we have to endure gold spammers
---
Its as it was, only warriors dont equip cloth these days
---
About four months in. Personally I think thats a pretty reasonable time limit for everyone but the most casual of casuals who wouldn't be able to get the mount anyway so they might as well not rush.
---
Your solution would be worse for a single reason: wtf do they do with all those level 70 characters? The first time they reset everyone's level back down to 60 and take away all their awesome gear they would lose most of their players.
---
&gt;Revamping low level questing content, while appreciated, treated the symptoms rather than the problem.
---
I agree, and that's kind of what I was saying. They realized that this "layer new expansions on top" wasn't going to work forever, so they tried to slow down the end game content, and revamp old content to incentive people to use it. But people had already adjusted to the "end-game only" mindset they got from WotLK and (partly) BC, so they didn't adjust their playstyle at all, they just blew through the limited end game content.
---
&gt;So ultimately the best thing Blizzard did wasn't cutting old content, it was providing the free level boosts with expansion purchases so that new/returning players could be where the majority of players were, experiencing that living MMO.
---
I think people in this content are referring to level boosts as skipping content. If you buy a lvl 110 boost, you are essentially skipping 6 continents and 6 expansions worth of content.
---
TBF Vanilla is 1-60 whereas BfA (and every other expansion for the most part) is just max level content.
---
The beta could very well end on July 19th.
---
Sorry but that's such a lame thing to complain about lol
---
Boss damage vs non boss damage 
---
Slow attack speed vs faster attack speed
---
There, saved you 13 mins.
---
He did not, he held an attitude of "i don't think i do, so i won't". He wanted classic servers for classiv players.
---
Fuck yeah, there‚Äôs no other game I want to play.
---
Play Old School RuneScape
---
It would fail immediately. Every character that got though the first xpac content would be at level 70. Then what happens?
---
Ow, the edge
---
WeakAuras
---
I got in trouble for needing a green Cloak of fire damage (or some random useless enchant) in deadmines.    
---
I was a rogue and didnt really understand stats or anything, i thought it might make me deal fire damage or something and i my current cloak was white...  
---
Also, i used one of those swamp ooze pets when it dropped off a mob for me before thinking of selling it.
---
That's from patch 1.9.2, as the guy above stated using Thottbot, it might have been changed somewhere between 1.11 and 1.12...
---
I do not think Blizzard "screw up all elites data and just put some portrait on them". That is some next level delusion.
---
ISTJ-A, Ret Paladin for PVP
---
This is a problem on your end.
---
If you can find one that does that does more than 5 dps.
---
Big iron pole is like a level 25 white for damage which is why it's kinda useful.
---
**\[H\]\[NA\]\[PST\]\[PVP\] FATE**
---
**Fate** *is a vision of mine:* To create a Classic World of Warcraft PvP Community that values its people first, and progression second. One that gets the job done, but doesn‚Äôt use buzzwords, or treat people like meat to fill a raid group. An organized group with a sensible structure that puts our community and friendships first. More than a band of brothers and sisters, this will be a group that will become the masters of our own fate. 
---
**You may be wondering how will I do this?** And honestly, *I'm not sure yet.* I'm still in the process of building out the structure and *I need help.* Arthur didn't build Camelot alone, and I sure can't either. I'm looking for **community oriented** people with a **serious mindset** that want to get in on the ground level of something that's just a little bit different. There are no cliques here, no previous guilds, and no group of real life friends that have been gaming together since 1992 - It's just me, trying to reinvent the hammer and build Camelot.
---
**Raid Information**
---
I'm anticipating raids for the single team starting start in November/December. Raids will have a 10-15min Break partway through. A third day is reserved for World PvP and Premades. Friday will be eliminated as much as taurenly possible and converted into a voluntary PvP night. The days may be shuffled around depending on future preferences, but the start time will never be earlier.
---
**PvE:** Thursday, 6:00PM-10:00PM PST   
---
**PvE:** Friday, 6:00PM-10:00PM PST   
---
**PvP:** Saturday, TBD PST
---
**Contact Information**
---
I'm looking for a core of people that want to have a hand in building their own home from the ground up. If you wish to express interest, please contact me directly through Discord at Polarus#3461 - Let's talk :)
---
**Determination**   
---
**Community**  
---
**Connection**
---
I think people bitched that it was annoying so they changed it.
---
They aren‚Äôt independant because 1-60 *is* Vanilla. To render that irrelevant is to kill the entire game. 
---
Once you no longer fear killing Vanilla (because its been replaced by Outland/Northrend/Pandaria/Draenor) then you can absolutely (and necessarily) add catch-ups and power creep. 
---
Those things are intimately tied to the expansion paradigm.
---
Nice one. When was that?
---
I was actually a big fan of the world leveling up with you. I feel that if they squished the levels down i.e. 1-60. Still included the expansion content from most of the expansions, save for some of the key issues like flying
---
..ect and had the entire world open as potential end gamr content would be great. It would allow players to enjoy and follow any quest line and any zones they enjoyed and receive rewards relative to their level without monstrous gaps.
---
I'd love to explore the content of many of the expansions, but I have no reason to do so since the rewards are garbage and I'd get zero XP relative to what I could do in the current expansion. Would make LFG still required, and sharding from my incomplete understanding. But the "end game" would be the entire world.
---
I can but it doesn't help categorize class by personality type
---
"Need help?" Made me chuckle
---
Also INFP mediator and a priest main
---
Im not saying bad expansions didn‚Äôt hurt WoW, what im saying is that WoW could have bounced back but they failed to countless times. Even the good expansions after wrath couldn‚Äôt hit those numbers. Why are good expansions not able to? IMO because the times have changed. Legion and MoP were actually really good. Great raids, great story, MoP had the best class design, Legiondaries were fun but a bit annoying to acquire. Still couldn‚Äôt hit the old numbers. Even though we have people arguing Legion is better than TBC.
---
Also the stuff they double Down on is what players whine about. They only ever double down on stuff that pisses off the Main Sub and the forums. Like shitty Island Expeditions, Making M+ Worse than legion, Resetting classes every fucking expansion.
---
Also I have an issue with your statement about having to play the game for loot. The only true end game gear you can get is from high end PvP, Mythic Plus 10+, and Mythic Raids. And for some classes a combo of all 3. Those aren‚Äôt exactly easy, and I‚Äôd say they are harder than ever.
---
Especially with these bull shit mechanics that Blizzard doubles down on and the glitches they refuse to deal with till it‚Äôs in the Mythic invitational. But hey if something reduces the grind or is fun FUCKING REMOVE IT ASAP.
---
&gt; Rogue:  sub-par PvE dps 
---
lol ?
---
&gt;Hunter:  They both have very very very boring rotations in PvE, hunter is literally 1 button 
---
Seriously you don't know what you're speaking of : rogues are in the top 3 DPS with warriors and mages, hunter rotation is at least aimed shot and multi shot, sometimes tranq shot.
---
Same here. I'm also a spiteful bitch so idk how accurate these results are lmao
---
juste compare classic beta streams/videos with the new nazjatar questzone streams/videos.   
---
the first is a very well made computer game, a real mmorpg. the other one is Diablo 4, PC version.
---
I need someone to test if you can keep the stick you use to beat lazy peons. I would like to keep that motivation stick.
---
Wow great logic! So Rhahk'Zor in deadmines should do more damage than a Naxxramas trash mob then?
---
Did you quit "because pandas"? Because MoP was actually a really good expansion imo.
---
nah man the post is heavily upvoted on r/wow. don't do this us/them, people agree with him over there too
---
When the next expansion comes out, the characters are reset to lvl 60 and able to play through the next expansion at lvls 60-70.
---
And it wasn't my idea, I was responding to it.
---
All I can tell you is that in general, just be a team player. Buff randoms, toss useless gear and pots to friendlies. Try and follow the unspoken rules of respect in the game. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help either, vanilla veterans are generally eager to tell you how much they know about the game, myself included. Sure it‚Äôs not 1:1 from private to retail classic, but the knowledge is still valid. Enjoy the ride!!!!!
---
Its a save leveling class. What I mean is you stay close to full hp and mana almost always. And strong 1v1.
---
Yea you‚Äôre really testing the game by making quality videos like these based on gut feelings and anecdotal evidence. And when someone proves you guys wrong with actual numbers you still refute it. It‚Äôs very telling of this subreddit that a garbage, uneducated video like this has any upvotes at all.
---
only steamers get beta access. sorry
---
Interesting, also INFP-A but always main rogue. I have a feeling personality types are too broad to tie to class choice. I bet it's mixture more specific aspects like competitiveness that make us lean towards a specific class.
---
Not disagreeing that he wanted people to be able to play whatever version they enjoy but I specially remember watching his stream around the time nostalrius was shut down but he was very big on the vanilla wouldn‚Äôt be enjoyable for most people including himself which is why it‚Äôs great to see that he‚Äôs having so much fun playing the beta.
---
No I have, it's just been so long I forgot they had portals inside. I just never really went to that part of the map
---
It's got nothing to do with this video, and I'm not trying to create a flame war, but I have to ask this:
---
Why the hell is Asmongold so damn popular?
---
He seems like a genuine miserable asshole. He's not charming, he's not particularly funny, he's argumentative, he's kind of elitist, and I just don't see the appeal of his streams. To me, he brings nothing positive to the table. 
---
His streaming of Classic will surely bring more people to the game, which is great. As someone who played in Vanilla, I would love nothing more than full, flourishing realms. But what exactly is the appeal of this guy?
---
Does he make people feel like they're in some kind of secret club? If you understand what he's talking about and parrot his opinions, does it make you feel really good at the game or something? I dunno man, someone please explain it to me. 
---
Again, I'm asking this genuinely, and I'm not trying to spark an argument or piss people off. I just don't get it. But maybe I'm missing something!
---
Why not make it so that you must beat level 60 content dungeons/raids to get a key that then unlocks the content to get to level 70, etc with each expansion. Ensuring that the old progression doesnt just dissapear.
---
Weird how you came to that conclusion when he‚Äôs comparing things in the same level range. Stay delusional.
---
I hadnt really checked what version this would be. Yeah warlocks would have been buffed in 2006. They were pretty shit in pvp before then. Makes sense  they're going alright if they're running the drums of war patch.
---
PepeLaugh he doesnt know
---
i am sitting in the same boat as you. i didnt play classic but i always was an enhancer main. there are many problems with enhacement shamans as they will not be welcome in any raid. you will 99% hear pls play heal or dont come to raids and the 1% you are allowed to raid with enhanc you wont get items as they will more likely give items to usefull specs. thats the sad truth my friend so dont be too excited.
---
Haha no, the way Hobbs did it out required careful gear planning and a whole host of other details. Nowadays it's just pull everything and spam your cleave ability.
---
I got the uigeadail, i prefer the laphroaig 10 though! 
---
But nice setup, I am working on getting my setup with whisky and gaming done!
---
Eh... every bug on Classic makes the game more boring. All these bugs are just leftovers from the changes existing in Legion. At this point I'm worried Blizzard will never fully get rid of them. They should have never based Classic on Legion client. We will keep finding these changes long after Naxxramas release.
---
INFP Warlock. But I used to play mistweaver
---
Hi, /u/bloodbeardthepirate
---
also /party "Loot so I can skin please"
---
They watched GoT, they know it's futile.
---
I'll be playing BfA
---
&gt;Prot warriors as flag carriers
---
Why not use a druid?
---
Will be able to find groups pretty easily for the first few months- people will just want to get in and go :)
---
Only issue you'd have is if you trying to be in a 1% guild or pushing raid content the second it releases!
---
Never understood this. Classic is not a race. Me and my buds will have an absolute blast. Will most likely reach lvl 60 in 3-4 months, running all dungeons, doing all kinds of goofy shit.
---
The ones who play for 16h a day, weeks on end just power leveling is gonna miss out on so much.
---
Hurry slowly, we have a ton of time to play.
---
Soon *‚Ñ¢*  was already a meme in 2006 lol
---
The worst worst thing they can do is keep layering permanent and making world bosses phased to those that haven't killed it and grouped with others that haven't killed it.
---
That's true yea. They don't make any actual meaningful content anymore, it's just grind after grind after grind with little to no thought behind it.
---
Also my point I was trying to make is that there have been no good expansions after wotlk; I've been playing WoW nearly my entire life and even as a kid I could feel the tonal shift in cata and future expansions. I was no longer having fun, not because I played alot (if I a game is good and I like it I can play forever). In the moment I kind of enjoyed cata, MOP etc but now as I reflect, I realize I actually wasn't having fun and I was playing because it wow.
---
I know that's a super grouchy position to take but that'd my opinion of the game. I truly feel that the wow we all feel in love with died with wotlk and it became a brainless cheesefest from that point on.
---
Like, of mythic+ raiding is the only actual engaging, challenging and interesting gameplay wow has to offer now.... Ya game is bad. Periodt. That's on that. Tea. Mic drop.
---
I'm getting rid of as much other entertainment back log as possible. Anime, TV shows, and RPGs will be caught up by then.
---
Projects around the house that are major repairs have due dates before classic is released. 
---
I'll still have to work and do chores. My wife will probably be frustrated with the time I intend to sink in... But it'll help to not have to worry about these side projects
---
Thanks
---
What about a tool that could save you the hassle of finding a group in a major city? It could even teleport you straight to the dungeon. That'd be hella sweet.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MnKAMbZkGgw?t=430
---
7:10 it wasnt always like that, but it surely did happen
---
Going to be hilarious when they talk about increased Q2 revenue to their investors.
---
&gt;I was actually a big fan of the world leveling up with you.
---
I actually liked that a lot too. But the issue is that the game would have had to be designed with this in mind. Right now, there is no linearity with questlines at all; TBH, it feels like Blizzard just realized the old world is pretty much a lost cause and just let people keep rushing through it. Like, I understand it was a HUGE undertaking to do this for the entire old world, but it seems like there are a lot of gamebreaking things that would present themselves. Like mobs dropping loot (cloth) based on their loot table, not based on what level they are. So a lvl 20 could farm Runecloth easily, while a lvl 60 might struggle farming Wool.
---
yeah it'#s pretty obvious what's wrong at this point but fuck me if they'd ever listen, lost cause, let's just enjoy classic.
---
Lock? You sure?
---
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates..
---
The typical spriest you met in wsg was called F√¶√ßem√´ltor
---
Always something with the fishing rods
---
I love Elemental Shaman.
---
I mained an Elemental shaman only from TBC till BFA. No alts, no offspecs.
---
But I want to raid on a serieus level so I had to choise between the class+spec I fell in love with or the Progress Im also in love with.
---
I'll be maining a mage and will level a shaman somewhere in the future.
---
I dont understand how they can hit the mob enough times to kill it, even with 60 people. And how the dragon doesn‚Äôt one shot everything it hits.
---
I spent a solid month from 20-30 on my gnome rogue causing hell here. Some of my best vanilla memories are from this hellscape.
---
Dude, I love your stuff! Keep it coming! I really enjoy content from guys like you, MadSeasonShow, and Joana. Y'all are so chill and detail oriented :)
---
How bad is Sm/Ruin for pvp? What‚Äôs the playstyle like
---
You seem genuinely upset, if you watched the video you'd see he compared level 30 and higher mobs to a level 19 boss. You ok?
---
He was just describing it as something sinister and I guess I just wouldn't know what he meant past some sort of stealth sponsorship, something actually wrong. But yeah, as you said it's a logical move that is weird to describe in the way that he did.
---
Are you one of his shills?
---
So What if I went with rogue or warlock? I‚Äôll be able to raid atleast once per week as long as the raid days are separated, sometimes I‚Äôll be able to make them all just not every week
---
Not at all... Dont listen to the opinion of trolls on yhe internet... I hated him because of all the reaction videos on youtube, but since ive started watching him playing wow beta ive been starting to like him. He is a good streamer
---
So they could remove it in the third phase and be perfectly fine or extend it and remove it in the 4th phase and give people a bit more time
---
I watched one video of him with his SM run... He was quite an ass... Is this normal or should I give him a second try? It seems people like him
---
"I haven't played vanilla, but here is how blizzard should change it". And people wonder why Reddit is toxic...
---
Typically Power Word: Shield, Shadow Word: Pain and a Mind Flay and then just wanding will give 100% uptime on mana. With enough spirit you can probably squeeze a Mind Blast in, too.
---
I thought I was third haha. I read they get it for two weeks then its returned?
---
Hmm I know that Grave Moss is quite valuable at 60 - not sure about anything else...
---
Maybe Thistle for the thistletea that Rouges use
---
Nope!  
---
I'm not particularly interested in doing the grind again once it releases and i (unfortunately) don't have the time to commit to doing all the stupid shit that the streamers are doing. I've been watching streams and getting just as much fun out of it! My fave atm is EsfandTV, he's a really cool/nice guy and not a jerk at all like some streamers can be/come across as.
---
You could use skinning knife for consistent white dmg and swap weapons for backstabs
---
Best thing you can do for yourself, DONT READ REDDIT or FORUMS after launch. Just play the game. Trust me, the community seems a lot better.
---
Idk man I played MoP because the classes and Siege of Org were fun. 
---
I played Legion because it‚Äôs everything I wanted from TBC. Good guy Illidan, Maiev, Demon Hunters, Fight the Legion, actually being invaded .etc.
---
Also Runnas the shamed and Khadgar HNGG.
---
The only way they coulda made it better is to make the legiondary shop available out the gate, bring back the old talent tree and bring back MoP Warlock. 
---
Though TBF TBC is the Aliens 3 of of WoW. There‚Äôs worse in the series, and ignoring the plot it‚Äôs not that bad.
---
But boy does the plot make me salty.
---
My favorite is when people crying about BfA but talk about how they loved Legion. Same fucking game, same systems, same Titanforging garbage, same endless AP grind, same Mythic+ grind. But somehow it was totally fine last time.
---
He said he had 100 Ms when I was watching yesterday.
---
No, even worse, they're making a bunch of strawman arguments that aren't even factually possible. Not only did barely anyone ever complain about narrative being detached from the player, but in fact, we've been called champions and greatest heroes of Azeroth since WOTLK (before a decade of WoW even passed).
---
Thanks a lot !
---
The true convert would be crendor... that guy was so adamant about his stance before, that I didn't think he'd even do the beta.  But holy crap... even he has nothing but good to say (so far).
---
A true legend, I remember watching his SM farm runs and it was really chill to watch and almost made me roll a Paladin. :)
---
I'd just started dating a girl in year 11. I was ditching school on Friday with my friend to go have an all nighter on WoW. As were leaving new Gf sees me and is like "oh you're ditching school, let's hang out". Without a second thought I reply "sorry I have plans with Chris, cya later".
---
My mate had never had a girlfriend and couldn't believe that I thought WoW was more important. I ended up clearing Sunken Temple for the first time that night. It took about 8 hours but I enjoyed every minute of it. Monday back at school, gf asks to hang out again, but I *have plans*. She broke up with me the same day üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ no regrets
---
I mean, you can watch the video and judge for yourself I guess.  Seems genuine to me.  He even said he still loves raiding in retail, but everything else about classic he feels is better.
---
I'm looking forward to classic however I did like MOP more, it was the last really good expansion.
---
It reset and flew back to Blasted Lands after the alliance were all killed
---
WoD was the first expansion that made me realize the Art/Cinematic teams are the carry of World of Warcraft.
---
Classic isnt 1.12.1 but rather patch 7.1.5 trying to imitate 1.12.1 as closely as possible so ofc there will be mistakes like that and even on release theres a high risk for bugs or such from later expansions to exist i just hope the bugs wont turn out to be something overpowering :D
---
No reason to go to 60 on beta. Thinking logically it‚Äôd be hard to expect a level cap to 40 this week. They‚Äôre doing another stress test Wednesday, so if it were to happen it would be Friday which just seems weird for them. 
---
All we can hope is that it does happen sometime and that they do a beta wave when it does.
---
They are not. Layering is actualy even worse than the sharding they initialy had planned.
---
Stregen. Won't play hunter, but blacklist me anyway. Kinda don't wanna be anywhere near you.
---
I was thinking that you just make it so some unique realms just don't have some QoL features on them, not get rid of LFG or LFR entirely.
---
Blizz knew that people would try this.  So it was free money for them.
---
Guilds could challenge themselves by re-rolling different classes and doing it all again from scratch.
---
Is it last week again?
---
yo im NA-West Coast PST. im down to duo level with you as double rogue team. you can reach me on discord 007#1267
---
It just procced damage, not an actual extra weapon swing.
---
I've paid for way worst Betas lol
---
How much would i pay? Well i resubed just to have a chance to get in and gonna stay subbed till its released, which will cost me 45$ so for a guaranteed chance, probably 50-100$.
---
To be fair Vanilla Wow was buggy as hell and pretty broken with most issues being fixed in TBC. It remains to be seen if it stays as close to the original as people are hoping, I‚Äôd wager whiners will cause Blizzard to respond like they always do and ‚Äòfix‚Äô it :(
---
True. But for me leveling is PvE is also more furfilling because now Im capable of playing effective. Wich is somehing I love.
---
If he has a shield, then you did good.
---
Try and do all the content you can while you level, it may not be efficient to run dungeons etc but some of the best times I had in Vanilla were running dungeons with my buddies. Same goes with quests, some are not time efficient or just boring but try and do as many as you can in as many zones as you can. 
---
The best feeling is being 60 and knowing you explored as much as possible and played the "leveling game" to its full potential.
---
OMEGALUL MEGALUL
---
You're wrong, Blizzard knows you're wrong, your nostalgia goggles for your 12 year old self sucking at games are wrong and your broken private server was wrong. That's all there is to it
---
See i can see why you enjoyed MoP, but it was just so antithetical to what an mmorgp is supposed to be. MoP was when I truly realized wow had become a theme park mmo; just being taken from lil area to lil area to do a cpuple quests and move onto endgame. I levelled so quickly that I ended up missing dungeons and huge chunks of the zones which was weird.
---
I just truly find everything after wotlk being shallow shit.
---
(I did enjoy vale of eternal blossoms, mogushan palace and some of the raids. But other than that.... Meh... Boring and generic.)
---
This idea is just bizarre lol
---
&gt;It's rather do-able to heal dungeons as a dps spec while you're leveling up.
---
Understatement of ... well lets say month. No sub L54 instance group \~ever had a healer that wasnt dps spec. And their tanks werent tank spec either.
---
Does the sword proc have a chance to crit? Or be dodged? Etc?
---
5k imo.
---
Lvl 30~ = an end game lvl 60 raid mob? Ok, good to know.
---
&gt; We are the ones actually testing the game and trying to make a faithful authentic recreation.
---
No you're not, you're trying to create a fantasy alternative based on your shoddy ass memory and broken private servers.
---
Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have been so conservative in my post, because my actual solution is even more radical. 
---
You see, 1-60 Vanilla was designed as its own holistic, cohesive experience, right? Everything from mobs, to gear, to resources, to geography all work in conjunction to maximize *one world vision.*
---
TBC, as much as I love its aesthetic and mechanics, was a huge step back for the MMO genre because it violated the *one world vision,* with incompatible resources, divorced profession and experience levels, disconnected geography, non-retroactive mechanics, etc. 
---
You simply cannot add content to a preexisting MMO world that was not designed with that content in mind. 
---
That‚Äôs why every ‚Äúexpansion‚Äù must be its own, integral, separate game, with its own complete, cohesive, holistic, 1-60 experience in order for them to maintain the integrity of their individual experiences and worlds. 
---
Players will have to eventually learn that the mechanic of infinite progression is actually *anti*-MMO design. 
---
Some other MMOs get around this terrible idea via Prestige, or Ancestor, systems, but it‚Äôs insane that MMO-players have been taught to expect their character to *only ever get stronger* in a *meaningful,* consistent way. 
---
It‚Äôs like wanting to play a perma-death bullet-hell and getting furious that you don‚Äôt have infinite continues or that you can‚Äôt respawn right where you left off. 
---
But somehow two generations of players were convinced that this not only made sense, but made for a better MMO.
---
Addons are downloadable customization options. More options is always good imo.
---
I think you might have to buy the riding skill for 10g?
---
INFJ 'Advocate' Warlock... hmmmm.
---
i have been bored for the past 2 months not wanting to play anything and waiting for classic. 
---
Now i decided to play some old school rpgs and same rpgs i did not get the chance to play yet to pass the time. got gothic 1,2,3. risen 1.
---
Then Dragon's dogma, Elex.
---
If i still have time (about 2 weeks left) before classic launch i will try outward.
---
Work on a playlist!
---
I've been in two guilds that died because of loot council. They demanded that people would farm pre-bis posthaste, any mysteriously after a month in BWL the only people who had any BWL pieces were the officers.
---
Not about WOW, but this test is the only test i have done by the past which is really meaningfull.
---
not the typical 20 question test =  you are introvert submissive man.
---
a really good test you should all do without thinking to wow and share :)
---
I've used a Logitech G13 for years and can't imagine playing without it. But they don't make it anymore so if it stops working i'm screwed.
---
What's the stick like on the orbweaver? It doesn't look like a conventional analogue stick.
---
It was sarcasm because of how absurd your statement was about the video. How's BFA m8?
---
Ex and I were hardcore Vanilla to WOTLK player and she just called 2 weeks ago as i'm single. Looks like fate, gotta do my duty.
---
Same. Maybe getting out of WoD just made them so happy, enough to write off the whole of Legion as decent.
---
This guy‚Äôs excitement for fighting Alliance and screaming ‚ÄúFor the Horde‚Äù makes me hyped. I love how into it he is.
---
Meanwhile on retail all the fun is banned
---
Doubt it
---
Well, everything in classic is a clusterfuck overall ^^,
---
Why did I watch this? Who **cares** about some manchild's reaction to a video? I thought there'd be something particularly interesting, but it's not, he' just watching a video and reacting. Why post this dumb thing?
---
Not this again...
---
Some other MMOs have been experimenting with seasonal, rotating endgames, simply because *expansion-stacking* is actually an anti-MMO paradigm. 
---
It dilutes the population, renders most of the game‚Äôs content trivial and irrelevant, and creates power progression that eventually feels perfunctory and meaningless. 
---
My actual radical solution is that all expansions should have just been their own, independant, integral, cohesive, holistic 1-60 experiences.
---
same here!
---
Leveled a resto druid. Thought that meant I shouldn't use feral forms. Distinctly remember the barrens and later in STV: entangling roots + wrath + moonfire. Ran away and died a lot. Was ganked by countless gnome rogues.
---
I may not have figured it out entirely until later after my second character, a mage.
---
I wondered if they would keep the old gun sound for classic, so that question is answered for me. As to why they changed it. It baffles me as well. No real reason why they would do that imo.
---
I want optional servers with staggered level caps for the actual release. Two weeks at level 30, 40, and 50.
---
Someone took it personal real quick topkek
---
Play more indies, there's gems, key is to discover new styles that you love. People changes and after wow you're scarred about gaming, It's normal. I played massive survivals and rogue likes, was good.
---
Can we get a fucking warning for assmongold links? Jesus.
---
Did you play this game circa 2004-2006? You could not pull 5 elites like the video demonstrates.
---
A+++
---
Agree on all this.
---
Hi, /u/Cupcakeboss
---
Play City of Heroes. This was my first proper MMO, I can't believe I'm able to play it again and also wow classic in the same year. 2019 has been the revival year of my two favourite games and I couldn't be happier.
---
It's literally everywhere. Google 'wow classic phases' and you'll see all planned  releaseds for raids/BGs.
---
This man knows what he's talking about
---
You can read up on the 6 stages off content that Blizz has decided upon
---
Blizzard said that it wasnt a bug, they just have larger than normal hitboxes, times that x2 because it was tauren v tauren and you got the situation you saw
---
/r/waternagas
---
Over 1k hours to hit lvl 60.  How?  I've heard of people taking up to 600~ or so because they read every scrap of dialogue available and ran dungeons a lot, but 1200ish hours?
---
The amounts of whispers of people thinking you had nothing better to do than cast a hundred water (4 a cast before it was buffed, 20% of your mana) and bread (at least stacks of 20 iirc) or leave your group and make portals for randoms is too damn high. It's not like I never want to help anyone but damn. 
---
And portal Runes cost like what? 20s? Doesn't sound like much? If you were not actively farming money in some way, Gold was pretty scarce and spending 1 or 2 gold on portals for strangers an evening (+ portals for your own parties) could slow down your savings progress a lot...
---
the little payo ofc
---
Well stacking spirit while you lvl up is quite good, one of the best stats.
---
Not the same eyes colour though
---
I mean, level 5 on the stress test was more fun than anything I do in BfA these days. Level 30, that's not even a discussion.
---
Level 29 twinks will probably make good use of the new info. It is rather niche, though, I agree.
---
What effort have you made, to lookup the info you want ?
---
The INFO is everywhere......
---
There are different servers in wow, and they are categorized under German French English etc, Drak thul for example is populated by 80% czech and slovak players, people chose where they play and you cant do it for them, no one can, i think there will be a few different servers with different language priorities but like i sayd people chose where they play i am from slovakia living in austria vienna and playing on ravencrest. if i would have been tols i can only play on german servers i wouldnt play the game.
---
It will be like it is in private servers, but to a bit of a lesser degree.  It will be similar to how it is in the city of heroes private servers currently that are so popular.  It will be quite like OSRS was when it first hit. 
---
A new player wont be an outcast, but you will feel more alone and confused when everyone around you already knows where to go, how to best get there, and may be thinking you already know as well.
---
That's a really unique one. I like that
---
It's gonna be way way waaaaay worst IMHO
---
The number of people comming from retail that are not aware of what you just said... 
---
Prepare to reroll üòÇ
---
Stop making these threads please :'(
---
Not really. As a company, if you use a beta to catch bugs like this, you're doing it wrong.
---
Never tell me the odds.
---
Funny story happened today. Well maybe it's not funny. But anyway...
---
I don't have beta, so I've been wasting time on trial starter characters. I noticed that Hunter growl is auto disabled in dungeons on my first run. Or so I thought. I run another dungeon, but growl turned on. I don't know if it's really supposed to disable, or how it turned on. Anyway I never noticed, and got kicked from the group. Only the second time in all my WoW life that I've been kicked.
---
I apologise to the others for not noticing.
---
my smile and optimism: gone.
---
You need Jesus.
---
Most likely you were watching an online match from an undisclosed PVP server, which are hosted quite often these days. Try Classic PVP discord
---
I am sure Zac is already on it.
---
I have killed Heroic 10 Lich King with a buddy who clicked his spells.
---
Blasphemy
---
I think pallys are going to be extremely rare this time around.  Anyone who knows what you do during raids will know how boring/tedious is it to be a single heal spammer and buff spam bot.
---
&gt; 15 years of content.
---
I don't think so. A lot of content has been redone and removed (as good as the entire Vanilla experience, remember?), and outside of max level content, the entirety of content is for the purposes of collecting it. So if you're not into collectathons, about 95% of WoW's content is irrelevant to you. 
---
Even if you are partially into it (e.g. because you like collecting transmog sets), there's no challenge to most of it, so all you do is burn time while mindlessly clearing old raids, hoping for those drops.
---
It's a necessary side effect from the way WoW does progression (strictly linear): Everything but what's at the top is obsolete.
---
Yeah that's what I'm doing. This 1.12 Teldrassil scouting won't be done by itself.
---
That makes sense of course but I'm more concerned if you're allowed to speak your language in chat? I just remember most Pservers I played on wouldn't let you speak your native language in anything other than guild chat.
---
Does the same principle apply to live servers? Sorry if this is stupid question. I have my characters on Ragnaros in live but I can't seem to recall anyone speaking so I don't know what the rules are for that.
---
I think you either love him or hate him. I don‚Äôt like him either :) but if you see the kind of retards people enjoy to watch (e.g. IcePoseidon) then really anyone that is loud and fakes reactions can get a following.
---
That's it!
---
Layering/sharding.  It is the only thing keeping most of my friends from playing the game atm, and I can't say I blame them.
---
You just want rp servers so you can do that weird shit in goldshire inn.
---
For the record, this is not maintainable. 
---
In 2-3 weeks, classic content - with still lvl 30 cap - will run out
---
How about Elder Scrolls Online? The highest level is 50 and has been since forever. And then there are champion levels (CP) that are expanded a bit for each expansion, but overall doesn't greatly imbalance the game. Content is adjusted for CP level 160 anyways (easy to reach in a few days after reaching level 50), but newer content can be more challenging due to mechanics. Then there might be new classes added, new dungeons, new areas, etc‚Ä¶
---
Frost mage makes a stupidly high amount of money from aoe farming elites in hearthglen, or abusing the DM exploit by resetting the instance after clearing the plant groups.  
---
Honestly, if money is the goal, then mage is so far above the rest in vanilla, it feels unfair.
---
I'm rolling balance anyway
---
Instructions unclear, queued for AV...
---
Dont forget the charge in a group of 5 mobs into berserker stance into "heal?"...
---
To be fair, it also isn't out of the realm of possibility that Blizzard doesn't have every number correct, hence the 3 month beta outside of simply stress testing things.
---
yeah that leeway seems a bit much
---
There aren‚Äôt really any rules for the public chat channels, certainly none about what language you‚Äôre allowed to speak.
---
Venruki - Massively skilled and wholesome guy too its a pleasure watching him. No Homo ?????
---
Most underrated comment
---
15 years and people still can't spell Rogue correctly.
---
that cage fights!
---
You cannot play the game with "everyone". Don't think about it that way.
---
Play the game, find friendly players be they new or veterans.
---
I'm new to the game too. I really don't like an elitist, rushing attitude, it's not my play style. So I created a guild. ;)
---
We are basically already full. There will be many people who'll be a great fit for you too, I'm sure, just look for them.
---
https://classicdb.ch/
---
Earthshatter and Sulfuras.
---
You get it, man.
---
Assuming he's referring to the fact that these pets have the ability screech, which is great for leveling. I wouldn't use them for soloing dungeons though as screech does very little AP-reduction and it won't help against bosses. I'd rather have a pet with higher armor value as it's by far the most important stat for pets survivability against regular hits, like a turtle or a crab. The damage of a solo-pet is irrelevant.
---
I was following this stream until my connection timed out. 
---
Can anyone tell me what happened? Last thing I saw is them wanting to bring it to Undercity, they kited it up until the border of Wetlands and Arathi Highlands.
---
Got to level 40 on my first character before I found talents
---
Druid tanking in the end game is way more gear dependent than warriors in vanilla, so keep that in mind.  
---
For 5 mans along the way to 60?  Really don't feel there is too much of a difference between the two apart from warriors having better single target aggro with sunder. 
---
But yea... give up your dreams of being a main tank in a raid as a druid.  That doesn't happen till TBC, but if they do release that expansion, then you become an absolute legend.
---
My guess is Blizzard will release TBC in ~24 months and open a few new fresh servers that are Vanilla only. All the current servers will get TBC and those refusing to play TBC will have to start over on a new server.
---
Back when gaming was a niche thing for social outcast nerds, devs were much more likely to take creative risks and do shit that they wanted to do, which is always the best way to approach art (do what you want to do).
---
Since some moneybags realized there is money to be made there, gaming became just another pop-culture medium with statisticians figuring out the most streamlined shit a game has to do to appeal to as many people as possible.
---
Sadly, as we know with all other media, the most common denominator is also the most boring. Look at the shit on TV, what became of Star Wars, pop music... and yes, I do have guilty pleasures myself. Doesn't mean that shit is objectively good in any fashion. 
---
Dilbert kinda had an episode about this, where Dilbert mocks art and says it's easy to be a successful artist. You just need to figure out what people like and give it to them. He knows that people like ducks and the colour blue, so he paints a blue duck and it becomes super famous... it totally misses the point of what art is, though. 
---
A way for an artist to express themselves, something personal. Giving people what they want is the opposite of that.
---
Games are art. In many ways, the most involved art we have, because it covers almost all senses (need cybersniff2000) and gives a more wholistic experience than strict story telling, strict music composition or uninteractive audiovisual media. 
---
Selling out to the most common denominator like live WoW has removes all soul from a piece of art.
---
you guys are mistaking free action potion with living action potion. Free action potion is quite cheap and obtainable, making you imunne to 30s. However it does not delete current movement impairing effects. You are talking about living action potion, obtained in ZG and with expensive mats
---
Well that sucks. That does worry me a lot. It makes sense I suppose but then again I imagined that they'd have some servers specifically for people that want to only speak the largest languages like French/German/Russian and such. 
---
Oh well, guess I'll just roll the dice and hope for the best. 
---
Thanks for the clarifications guys!
---
Not specifically a guild, but if it feels good then sure! 
---
Im very busy with work etc so Ive not thought about joining a guild yet.
---
My old RP guild was loyal to Rend and considered him the true warchief, used to have guild meetings out in nowhere hidden away from the Horde. Having to do UBRS felt bad.
---
I guess we will be seeing you in game.  You are being pulled back, and I highly doubt you will be able to resist it considering you felt the need to make this post. 
---
Also, a 28 year old telling all the 'kids' out there to have a good time.  Most people who played WoW back then were 18+.
---
he built his audience on youtube before starting twitch fulltime 2 years ago.  he used to be a pretty good dps warrior in a decent progression guild, who had all kinds of content on pushing dps, obscure achievements, etc.  generally just a guy who loved wow
---
since starting twitch, his guild died and his content was never the same tbh.  it does help he's a major player in the wow section nowadays, it's a lot more fun to watch him interact with others (mcconnell, esfand, soda etc) then it is to watch him by himself (imo)
---
lol the personality description they gave me is so wrong for who I am
---
Pserver though
---
The semiotics of the word retail in relation to Wow has changed to mean "modern version" for most people, myself included.
---
It's not a big deal really imo, as people know what you're talking about.
---
If it was really that, then time and time again I am frustrated how a vocal minority ruins the fun for everyone else.
---
I don‚Äôt recall what it was but I know we got R1 in S3 with our holy paladin running a level 60 trinket or libram.
---
what the actual fuck are you on about?
---
I want a new mmo
---
Idk about the shaman being as slow as Rogue tbh. Shaman is definitely in the top and not the bottom.
---
I've never heard of an 'ironfoe run'.
---
Also yeah, I don't remember ever having to get a full group just to smelt dark iron, so I don't know why you'd even call it something.
---
But if I ever wanted to call it something, 'lava run' would be my last option.
---
Not really. 
---
After a while, people realized hunters needed to constantly buy ammo and deal with pet happiness, so saving on the repair bill wasn't frowned upon at all.
---
Kalimdor and EK scaling up with you while also having minimum level requirements for higher level zones was the best addition to 7.3.5 that they did absolutely nothing of value with. The world scaling is awesome, as it keeps older content relevant for longer, and it's engaging, because (until you hit the scaling cap) nothing you fight is ever trivial. 
---
Then they said "have fun, keep racing to level cap," and the old world immediately became irrelevant again. They went through so much effort to get everything scaling comfortably, then didn't do the followthrough to make it relevant to higher level characters. I'd LOVE to have a reason to go back to 1-60 zones on my 120, and fight enemies that can put a dent in my health bar. (I suppose the Warfront-updated Darkshore and Arathi world zones are an attempt at doing this, but they only matter for like two days out of the Warfront cycle.)
---
They developed a similar tech to GW2's, but didn't turn it on for max level characters, so old zones still have the same problem where you one-hit everything, and the loot enemies drop doesn't matter.
---
Making friends seemed almost effortless during Vanilla. I played for 6 years before logging off for 9 years... I resubbed 3 months ago, and the friendship part is not the same. So w/ that said, dive right into Classic because you‚Äôll be fine (and likely pleasantly surprised).
---
you could always try full hybrid with [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2243/hand-of-edward-the-odd](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2243/hand-of-edward-the-odd) \+ a shield.  
---
or you could be everyone's fav enh shaman get nightfall ;)
---
Or possibly they will release tbc servers and give people free transfer options..... that way vanilla players can stay lvl capped and gear capped without having to re-gear etc and the ppl wanting to move on wont need to start at lvl 1 either.
---
Humans will do a lot more dmg in PvE. For PvP you should go dwarf/UD/orc
---
Latecomers face the problem of having to find 40 people to clear all the level 60 raids, while the majority of the playerbase is level 70. This would be circumvented by level 70's boosting the level 60's through the level 60 content.
---
Nothing against russians but I hope they get their own server. Most don't speak English and it gets quite frustrating to not be able to communicate.
---
They *do* have specific servers for most languages, but that doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs any enforcement of what language you speak on those servers.
---
hi, i have watched your video, and found another video from 2006 where 2 guys fighting the elite boar in razorfen kraul. [https://youtu.be/djh82dLmovs?t=166](https://youtu.be/djh82dLmovs?t=166)
---
it looks like the dmg he takes is the same dmg your druid takes. He is level 34; no shield; 2 hand sword;
---
This is not a bug though, the elite damage numbers are correct
---
If I was guaranteed a chance on day 1 of the beta. This lvl 30 cap seems like a once in a lifetime event/Meta I wish I was apart of.  I feel like a little brother watching streamers play.
---
Did his words upset you?
---
sure. AddOn creaters use the Beta to test/adapt their AddOns for Classic already.
---
His HS stuff is really entertaining, he plays some unique decks, waaay off the power curve, but with ridiculous win conditions.
---
Peak vanilla
---
Hopefully, they don't increase it at all IMO.
---
50 hours a week?  Might be possible, but it would be cutting it very close.  Speaking from a non power leveling point of view.
---
Not sure how much faster it would be if you just stuck your nose to the grindstone with the right knowledge, but 200 hours for the month is going to be rough either way.
---
After 2-3 years, I doubt the majority will want to stay frozen in time. Blizzard will go with whatever‚Äôs easier for themselves and then the majority. I just want WotLK back.
---
If they do add new content they could go for a multi-functional approach. Things like the Dire Maul tribute run or the Stratholme timed run allow higher tier players to still be challenged by and benefit from lower tier content.
---
I've thought about making it even lower, maybe 1 level per expansion. Lvl 61 dungeon gear would be = ZG gear, 10 man  Kara = MC gear, 25 man kara = BWL gear, etc. with only BT / TK / Sunwell providing better gear than Naxx.
---
Rush b blyat
---
What more do you need?
---
Hi, /u/Cr0wL0ck
---
Quality content. Bug hunting and booty shaking.
---
this did not work in vanilla. you have to get naked and die to get back to the beginning.
---
considerable? no, think like singular percentage points of differencE
---
It shows that challenging content can be a lot of fun, and it doesn't have to be advanced raid mechanics like in retail. Unfortunately though, there will be no reason to do something like this on release and same-level content will be fairly easy for today's average player.
---
It seriously was compared to the stuff we have today. Take off your rose tinted glasses.
---
Yay, wand the target for the pally buff to regen your mana
---
That sword is still good.  People like to play the min max card, but in a time where you are missing so many hits, having a bit of extra attack speed isn't 'that' big a deal.
---
Not denying that the axe is better, but the sword is still a fine weapon.
---
I recently took a journeyman riding lesson irl and it cost less than that in USD.
---
you are correct, this is what used to happen.
---
He's doing good testing but all mobs had specific dmg, a lvl 30 elite could do 3x more dmg and have 3x more health than a lvl 31 elite. Because they're all different.
---
I trust blizzard is testing with their 1.12 vanilla client to make sure everything is correct.
---
The reason people think DM is so much harder is because when WoW came out, every class was worse than in 1.12 and you tried DM at lvl 15-16. They did it as lvl 18-20 in 1.12 on beta.
---
DM was always easy if your entire party was around lvl 20. The game it self i quite easy.
---
Molten Core was easy, ZG was easy, BWL was easy. Always has been and will be again. AQ40 was harder, Naxx was quite hard. But with the knowledge we have about everything now, AQ40 and Naxx won't really be hard either.
---
this does not sound at all right from my own experience.  BWL was not possible in an hour
---
Agree with you. Let's bump this up.
---
Are those servers specifically named with the languages in mind so I don't accidentally pick them? Like Ravencrest - France or something?
---
I'm fine with no enforcement, I imagine people that want to speak their language would mainly roll there then.
---
Oooh, for cooking. Of course. Makes sense.
---
Why did I think about "MOOOM, BATHROOOM!!" for a second?
---
is this "The Drama" people talk about? I am all day on Payo's madness, so am lagging behind. Would you summarise it for me, please?
---
Well we‚Äôve already failed in that regard to an extent. We should‚Äôve held them to ‚Äújust the starting zones‚Äù like they originally said and we unfortunately didn‚Äôt.
---
I sound like a broken record because I keep talking about RotMG, but I love how it exemplifies many of the solutions. 
---
RotMG is a bullet-hell, perma-death MMO. The whole point of running dungeons is to unlock harder dungeons and get as much endgame gear that you can then use to empower (to a certain degree) your descendant. 
---
Descendants are the future characters you‚Äôre going to have to level from scratch  because *you will eventually die.*
---
Now, this premise could never work in WoW, but its a great example of how it solves the problem of adding expansion content (all expansions are *horizontal*, not vertical). 
---
It also solves the problem of leveling becoming rare after the initial surge. You‚Äôre essentially *always* leveling, in a way. But your ancestor‚Äôs achievements aren‚Äôt entirely in vain, since the Prestige system is so important for the descendant‚Äôs power progression. 
---
Anyway, just game design food for thought :)
---
dawai bomb, spasiva
---
Ur welcome
---
I had so much fun with open world pvp there back then :D
---
I spent many days there just fighting instead of leveling. Highlight was a sun rock raid with guild.
---
Subbed as soon as beta was announced got in the next day, and no I'm not a streamer/youtuber. Yes I consider my self very very lucky. None of my friends got invites sadly....
---
well you can do this by playing 16h/day as well?
---
What do you intent to do with the information gathered from the survey?
---
Agreed :( and now there‚Äôs even more new classic fans defending layering... Looking to be the biggest issue for me for classic.
---
I was ahead of my time :D
---
i only stress tested but it felt pretty easy to me. my only input is that i was 100% a shitlord in vanilla. The type of warlock who bought vendor whites for the armour upgrade and melee attacked mobs. i think its probably right and 15 years of playing the video game has made content that was once hard seem very trivial because it was hard at the time for my peasant child brain.
---
What happens when 95% of the playerbase is five expansions down the road for raid "attunement" and basically nobody needs to do the 60 raids? It worked in Vanilla because there were only so many raids you needed to gear up through before you caught up to the majority of raiders. A latecomer to the game could be stuck at the beginning of the attunement chain because everyone and their grandma is already cleared up to the modern raids they actually want to do. Can you imagine trying to convince your guild to run you through 26 raids just to catch you up to where they are?
---
Literally  unplayable.
---
Hur durr you dislike my idol, better down vote him that will show him.
---
enhancement? we don't do that in classic.
---
Have you never played retail? On EU there are servers for each major language... German, French, Spanish, Italian, and English of course.
---
Resto
---
Mage is king for raw gold making. 
---
Hunter is the fastest/easiest to level, with warlock being not too far off.  
---
Every class does fine in 5 man, and even moonkin/ret pallys do well in them (just not in raids).  
---
Warriors validate us all; pick a warrior and prove yourself a true man.  Only a real man can endure the torture that is the leveling process.
---
ZULOL
---
I'd wager 99% or rogues won't have the skull equipped in wpvp.
---
Yes, the realms can be sorted by region, time zone, and language.
---
Dragon got reset
---
No evidence other than the original 1.12 build they have showing numbers exactly the same as the beta.
---
Best part about this zone is that it takes you to Desolace. I hate STM.
---
Looks like I triggered his followers. Say anything bad about "dear leader" and have to down vote to appease him. Lol
---
I do agree that some if the current problems were already present during Legion, but Something about that expansion just *felt* better.  I don't know whether it was the Artifact Weapon upgrade trees being more compelling than Azerite gear RNG, the smoother class gameplay, the Legendary being cool items, or something else entirely.  But for whatever reason, the daily grind of BFA just isn't nearly as tolerable as it was in Legion.
---
Oh man, you can do that? I need to get in on that.
---
People going "Classic was never hard" need to be put in a bag and beaten with a stick. It's so fucking tiresome.
---
Yes, MC wasn't hard and current high end mythic raids are certainly more complicated than anything we had in calssic. Dungeon bosses often lacked any interesting mechanics.
---
But the trash was very demanding in terms of playing it properly. Mobs running in fear on low health, aggroing others. Interrupts being a requirement for many pulls. Pulling more than 1 group (with CC) meaning all your CDs and/or death. Having to watch your aggro (so you cannot just blow up shit) or just dying if you overaggro. Everything did SO MUCH DAMAGE to non tanks, and some mobs even to tanks. You had to actually watch your mana. AND you didn't outscale them with the very gear you find in them. Nowadays the difference between a freshly leveled heroic dungeon and a "heroic dungeon gear" heroic dungeon is comparable to the difference of doing Stratholme in leveling gear and doing Stratholme in BWL gear. The span of ilvls in classic over the entire expansion was about as big as a single raid tier nowadays. M+ is a good attempt at remedying the situation but ilvl inflation is still a huge issue in my book.
---
People who think classic wow wasn't hard think the only kind of difficulty is mechanical overload. A 3 page essay of boss abilities and interactions as well as a 30 button rotation. Yes that is one way to scale difficulty. Having mobs that hit very hard and need to be properly approached is another one, even if the correct approach makes them very bearable.
---
Dark Souls is regarded as one of the hardest games by many (obviously there is harder stuff out there) but you can boil it down to dodge enemy swings until you get an opening and then get in a hit or two. Rinse repeat. Super simple. And yet extremely punishing if you fuck up. Like if Guitar Hero game over'ed you for missing like 10 notes.
---
I'd love it if those communities could announce somehow the servers they're gathering to.
---
I can understand people wanting to speak their own language but it would suck for me if I ended up on a server where most of the people speak a language I can't understand.
---
&gt; Piling on expansion content in an MMO (seriously, who the hell thought this would be sustainable?) is what led to the bloated, power creep-riddled experience we have today.
---
What exactly does this mean?
---
OG vanilla developers cracked the code. They really got it right in that sense.
---
I have, I just don't remember choosing a server in years. I made my characters on Ragnaros many years ago and never really looked at what other servers there were. And since no one ever spoke that I could remember I just dont know the chat rules at all.
---
Sorry if this was a stupid question I was just wondering if they had said anything about this in interviews since I don't watch them.
---
The thing is, the difference it makes is so big to not rolling the human? I'm not planning to be ThE bEsTz MaGe on the server, but I wanna do if I do some PvP, my "disadvantage" won't allow me to not kill people.
---
Staysafe gets 60 ping from Oregon, so most likely central, and definitely not California
---
As far as I know, no.
---
It's just something that you get to know while playing. Like "Server x is mostly for y players".
---
And no enforcement. And if you ended up in the "wrong" server I'm sure people wouldn't bash you or anything if you ended up speaking in English by mistake.
---
A server where if you die your character is deleted and you're locked out from the server. Those who make it past certain goals are rewarded (like get a certain achievement, or pass a certain level).
---
"rogues are in the top 3 DPS with warriors and mages" um... no? they are basically white damage, Debuff is 16 stack so... 
---
"hunter rotation is at least aimed shot and multi shot, sometimes tranq shot."
---
Tranq is only for a few fights but the best dps rotation for hunters unless something drastic changes is just auto &gt; aimshot &gt; auto &gt; repeat.
---
Looking at good ol' Vanilla naxx clear videos, almost everyone did and keyboard turned.
---
WASD movement may have been standard for several games, but WoW was the first MMORPG for many people, and their first game they jammed a ton of time into in the first place.
---
Oooh, good counterpoint.
---
Okay thanks a lot! Ugh, I feel so stupid for asking, might delete the thread later before people make too much fun of me. 
---
Thank you for clearing everything up. Much appreciated!
---
You mean what weapons have the highest heal stats?
---
He has an interesting persona but I think it's understandable people who just watch the clips might not get the appeal. It's kind of an acquired taste. Personally I tend to just put his stream in the background while I'm working, I find it pretty entertaining especially when McConnell chimes in. I think what first grabbed me were the competitions though, the spec DPS showdowns and transmog comps with Asmongold as sole judge and jury are definitely top tier content.
---
Sorry if I don't want to see front page of reddit flooded with constant reposts about some streamer.
---
How about Blizzard use the level scaling that was used in BfA for each expansion, set max level to 60 and make it so if you want to complete dungeons or content for an expansion you have to complete so far into the quest chains for that expansion. For example if I started playing in BfA I could start from level 1 and level to 60 at the Vanilla pace to then complete the current Vanilla content, however if I wanted to complete the WotLK content I need to complete the WotLK quest lines but that can either be my choice to do at 60 or starting from level 1. 
---
I know there are some issues with gating the content from earlier expansions but it keeps the game integrated instead of being separate each time, allows players to play the new content without starting from scratch and abandoning the characters they have grown to love and keeps old content relevant.
---
In Tanaris there are these weird bugs south of Zulfarak. When they die, they spawn like 6 tiny bugs. The tiny bugs actually have a decent amount of health (Fnova CoC Shatter doesn't kill them) and it's impossible to cast anything non instant with 6 bugs pushing your cast bar back. It was doable but extremely hard and dangerous, oftentimes frustrating. This shit really taught me to use everything I have in WoW. Nowadays unless you raid heroic+/do mythic+ you can literally let your cat walk on your keyboard and be successful.
---
Took me about a year (irl time, didn't check /played) on my first 1-60. I wasted a lot of time exploring high level zones when I was low level because they were cool and dangerous. I probably had a higher /played time than her when I dinged :D
---
+1 on this, the vocal minority will be loud after launch. It could even be some pathetic gamers who don't even play WoW that just spam trash about how bad things are.
---
Ignore that, ignore forums, join a guild or play with friends. Focus on having fun with them and not letting forums destroy your view on WoW.
---
Spider Belt  [http://classicdb.ch/?item=4328#created-by](http://classicdb.ch/?item=4328#created-by)
---
Did i say it was bad? No
---
No, the mobs should turn on a dime and hit you in the back after you pass through them.
---
Wait so when it launches they aren't gonna share a subscription?
---
Server are categorized into languages. There's no way you will pick a sever for a language you don't speak.
---
That was pretty fun, when can we see the results?
---
I hope it stays at 30. It seems with BiS gear and enough Hunters you can take on dungeons of with enemies up to 13 levels higher than you. So this would mean we'd have pretty much all the dungeon content being streamed if they increased the level cap to 40.
---
I'd personally prefer if they just saved that content for release.
---
But you could have just control clicked them! Omg this one is so bad lol
---
That's the issue right. I really want to get into a semi hardcore raiding guild and so far I thought I'd do the authentic thing and just find a guild naturally but then I thought about the language barrier and now I'm considering finding a premade guild. Though that wouldn't be as fun. :( 
---
Might deal with the ping and weird timezone and roll US since I got a friend playing there. Not sure yet I guess I'll know in August.
---
So then when WotLk  comes out, you can also level 60-70 in outland rather than northrend? And with BFA you can choose between all expansions on where to level?
---
Or you don't level in outland and only in the newest expansion?
---
I don't understand how that could work.
---
Thank you! In three months, Classic will be as much of a 'retail' product as BfA, so it makes more sense to differentiate them as Modern and Classic.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a stupid question. The 100 threads per hour asking about beta access chances are stupid questions.
---
I don‚Äôt know if they did any adjustments going into/during TBC but I used to solo SM armory (since more melee mobs) on my level 40 prot Paladin. That indicates to me that people are overestimating.
---
I dont think faction change will be a thing simply because you cant faction change a Shaman/Paladin without forcing the player to pick a new class.
---
Odd, since can't you transmog the old models currently in retail?
---
Probably not though as there are already loads of 29 twink guides for every class/spec.  The 30 thing has to simply be enjoyed for now then it'll fade away forever.  To be honest it won't be fun for too much longer anyway.
---
I remember seeing him for the first time several months ago. I had unsubbed from BFA because the game felt so foreign to me after playing hardcore through wrath, then off and on until BFA (mostly off). I turned on his stream because he was the most popular, but nothing really held me for more than a few minutes. The gameplay was boring and totally unfamiliar to me, and asmon was boring and unremarkable.
---
With the beta, I've been watching asmon because I can't wait for classic and I like the content.  SM runs, wsg, kiting a dragon to the city, world pvp in arathi highlands, etc. He's a bit elitist but it makes it that much funnier when 60 horde try to fuck up his axe quest (I had a fucking blast swapping between streams that day) or when he fails at anything really ("NO, REDUEL" like when he used intimidating shout and his rend ticked, popping the enemy out of fear immediately and asmon was so pissed that he couldn't remember it was probably rend. That was funny to me). I've watched a few hours worth of his streams lately and he doesn't seem like an asshole to me. He's a passionate gamer. To me, an example of an asshole streamer is xqc. Also, there's a lot of legitimate discussion about the game on his streams too. I'm not saying I agree with all of his opinions but he answers a lot of engaging questions from chat.
---
Finally, like a lot of the other beta streamers, there's something really amusing about watching all of these popular streamers legitimately enjoying the game, almost fanboying over it while they're playing. They're actually having a shit load of fun, and I've been enjoying watching that.
---
All that being said, if I tune into his stream it's because I wanna see if he's up to anything interesting. If he isn't, I'll usually watch some horde streams instead like venruki or payo. I'm new to watching twitch frequently so I'm still feeling it out. My feelings on asmon are pretty middle of the road though. Dont hate him, dont love him, sometimes the stuff is funny. But it definitely wasn't notable to be during his bfa streams. Idk how he gained his following before the beta.
---
And I'd argue that your question ironically has everything to do with this video. Here he is doing something notable and fun, but you're asking why people watch him? This kind of material is one of the reasons people watch him.
---
Really it just depends on what point in wow we are talking about, rogues scale extremely well with gear, so while they are low tier for MC / Early BWL pushes, they start to shine a bit more as time progresses and push top charts with relative ease by Naxx.
---
Yeah I am off from the Tuesday and will be playing with my mate who also booked the week off. A warrior and a priest leveling together nearly 16 hours a day and enjoying every minute of it.
---
Are you saying.... ‚ÄúThey think they do but they don‚Äôt?‚Äù
---
They said the same about getting Invincible and look where that got me!
---
Can you still talk to the other faction through mind control?
---
I think you mean Retail &lt; Test with stress  
---
because in the test you're accessing the same client the beta testers are using, which is the same client used for launch.
---
Youre not gonna make any gold with herbalism tbh. Grind beasts and humanoids and you'll have alm the gold youll ever need
---
yeah nobody plays bfa dude haHAA
---
Why's he monitoring gcd abilities on such a large scale
---
I'll see what I can do later, maybe it can be saved.
---
So shamans and paladins will only be able to change races within their own faction. Blizzard might still give it to everyone else.
---
Well, you can craft weapons / scopes thats obvious, but bombs add some additional dps, you can make some resist trinkets that also spell reflect, you can craft ammunition, you can do a lot of things, really good soloing items as well, like target dummies and war chickens.
---
you got lootboxed brah!
---
You can download a soundfile that changes the gun and now sounds in retail, to the sound they had in vanilla. It does not affect anything else.
---
I couple more general pointers (as in not strictly Hunter related):
---
Play the game YOUR way. Reading guides and asking for tips is good, but never feel forced to play a certain way. Classic is slower in many regards and especially leveling. Experience the world, explore the zones and do the questlines (there are some fantastic stories to be had in the longer questlines). Try the talents YOU feel that will benefit YOUR playstyle instead of turning to "cookie cutter builds". Choose the professions that you feel are more fun or complement your playstyle and class and level them at your own pace. Don't be afraid to drop a profession if it's not working out or if you feel it isn't enjoyable. You'll have plenty of time to level a new one back up.
---
But most importantly: socialize, meet new friends, group up and kill rare elites, fish together, run dungeons with sub-optimal groups. Goof off and have fun! See you in game!
---
You‚Äôre so self righteous, you are my new leader
---
Of course it worked
---
Not even retail has all the languages spoken in EU.
---
English/French/German will be on Classic IMO, but for all the other languages, as happened before, people can form communities (usually) on English servers.
---
So you may have English servers overrun by people speaking Polish/Russian/Hungarian/whatever else.
---
That's what I would like to avoid if possible, since I'm going to play on an English server.
---
Human is the big one because of sword/mace spec which is +10% or so dmg vs lvl 63 IIRC. The others are far more negligible.
---
I found a Vanilla screenshot of a conversation between me and a mage.
---
Apparently I did something stupid with a mob and I apologize to him.
---
The guy has a kind of automatic message (I think you could do this by typing /dnd "message").
---
&lt;Do not disturb&gt; Need water ==&gt; go vendor
---
Need portal ==&gt; go zeppelin
---
Need gold ==&gt; go farm
---
Need help ==&gt; go find a friend  
---
I would post the screenshot but it's in French ;-)
---
thats just twinking essentially
---
I intend to share it with the public
---
The issue with scaling to match the 1-60 pace that is so important to WoW (as we‚Äôre all rediscovering thanks to Classic) is that ultimately none of the expansions were designed with that pace in mind.
---
The amount of zones and quests are low compared to Vanilla that I‚Äôm not sure how it would feel (probably bad, considering how much players complained that TBC content felt ‚Äúsluggish‚Äù after they scaled the world in 8.0)
---
But lets say we ignore all that, we‚Äôre still left with the fact that a server‚Äôs leveling population is going to be completely diluted across multiple expansion continents, except this time for a much longer period of time, which means emptier zones and less socialization. 
---
At that point the only way to really populate every zone would be to drop the idea of servers and server identity altogether and just have each zone be a persistent shard, like BfA Warmode, that autofills and auto-balances each questing area with levelers from all over the region.
---
They have a 1.12 server to check against. Fairly sure things that we notice and report will be checked against it
---
Easy solution: money upfront. I already calculated the minimum bread and water prices. :)
---
Goblins unite! On different servers!
---
I'm going to post the results in a few days or until we get a decent amount of responses
---
If Vanilla servers are abandoned because people prefer TBC, I don't see why you would want to force people to stick with Vanilla. They could merge servers if it gets desperate... but otherwise, let it play out.
---
From my anecdotal evidence, it seems to me that TBC is significantly more popular than Vanilla with the WoW playerbase as a whole.
---
By strong in pvp he meams 1v1. If xou plan om joining pre mades i wouldnt go for priest
---
In theory, yes. Replacing all your mail with plate armor would lead to roughly 25% to 35% less damage taken - which obviously is a big deal. That doesnt happen however. First you need to find good plate gear. And unless you leveled blacksmith to 200+ allready or are willing to spend a small fortune in the AH, it will take you quite some time to find that gear. And even when you find it there could easily be a leather/mail alternative that has better stats.   
---
So even though the power spike does exist in theory, its more of a linear progression.
---
\^ this.
---
I can see all of the servers being a ghost town if they go the route of opening servers for further expansions and leaving them at the EoL. This whole thing is a waste of time or a cash grab if they don't already have a good idea for brand new content after the phases end.
---
no :)
---
lvl 19 twink rogue fully geared toward agi and ambush damage can pump out 700-800 crit against clothy when fully buffed
---
Nah I dont really want to put in a lot of time only for it to be wiped on launch and me being burnt out from playing the beta and not wanting to start over. I got other games to play until launch I can wait for a while also gives me a chance to go out and do more stuff during the summer
---
Just ret things
---
I just printed my own at work on A0 looks amazing. Gonna be great for the LAN thanks alot!
---
Classic and Modern will share a subscription.
---
Let them stay at 30 for three more months. Let‚Äôs see who gives up first.
---
This is false. Blizzard is absolutely using the Classic Beta for testing and bug-finding purposes. They‚Äôre just also using it for marketing purposes.
---
lulRET
---
There was a silent gun many transmogged into to get rid of the sound.
---
Essentially but with the added aspect of all the PVE content which changes things up enough
---
Server transfer was available in vanilla as well.
---
Nous-autres fran√ßais sommes tr√®s  aim√¢bles üòäü•ñüç∑üëå

Because they want to make fun and get payed for it....Streaming is a job. Stop being so naive. They could do the same in retail, but nobody would watch it there
---
Weapon skills? *laughs in Paladin*
---
true
---
Do you even have a phone?
---
calm down, he asking for pvp!
---
right? right?
---
side note : in patch 1.12 windfury has been nerf down as hell don't expect guaranty one shoot on proc, and in the spec next to it you have an one shoot crit chain lightening and a good healer power make your choice
---
I'm not currently playing but SO is. Neither of us experienced anything like this. Gotta get your internet/in game settings/etc checked, something isn't right on your end.
---
It was a thing in Classic as well... I transferred during aq when my first guild died at Twins.
---
Acting like private servers are not real wtf is wrong with people
---
Okay first off, don't use that term if you have no idea what the fuck it means. You're fucking delusional if you think almost anything in retail is harder than classic. Retail is a fucking joke in almost every aspect in terms of difficulty.
---
We don't really have a a final phase date yet. For all we know there will be a lot of content for good year and a half before people are clearing the final raids and Blizzard has to actually figure out what they plan to do with Classic.
---
Even on the Blizzcon 2005 WoW raid design they said that there was no point in making a lvl 40, 50 or lower raid, since people outlevel it and its relevance its lost, same thing happened when BC came out, people stopped doing Vanilla raids since there was no point, and it happened again with WotLK, and so on with each expansion, only reason people started doing them again was the introduction of xmog, but people just facerolled the content, it wasnt actually a max level raid, just farming content for a chance at cosmetic loot week after week.
---
Je suis au boulot, je te post le screen ce soir ;-)
---
That‚Äôs a fair point
---
I think they should keep classic as it is. It should be preserved in it's original state so we can play it whenever we want, years from now, as with any other classic game that isn't an evolving game like WoW. It's really a piece of gaming history and it would be such a waste if they did all this work just to eventually change it into something else again.
---
I think a good and simple idea would be to start new servers once in a while as a sort of reset to get that fresh experience once again.
---
But if classic becomes super popular, maybe they could even make special, separate servers, for "evolving classic" :)
---
Warlock from TBC-Pandaria, rogue in WoD, DH in Legion, rogue again in BFA. (Though i am an altoholic)
---
What's cool about Vanilla is that our characters are not heroes or demigods, we simply are adventurers who slowly learn to become better. And they can become better fighters only with the help of the others. This is not the case anymore in retail. 
---
I want to become a simple adventurer again, fighting in a guild, on a well populated server. I don't give a f\*\*\*\* about killing about every last legendary named of Azeroth
---
The problem with legendaries was the randomness of getting them. The actual abilities and gameplay choices they created were a lot of fun.
---
Agreed
---
most guilds aren't going to take 40 people, why share loot when you can 10-15 man MC
---
No he was not a skeptic. His opinion was basically been there done that, but happy to let others experience it for themselves, and might play it as a side activity.
---
Why would anyone care about your opinion if you literally have no clue about classic. also why the hell are you making a reddit post when the info takes 20s to look up.
---
Sorry to say this, but they announced a week ago i think that they will not invite more people to the beta.
---
Yeah definitely agree, they were really fun to use, but sadly ruined by RNG.
---
In general I feel like the mods aren't fully equipped for the meteoric increase in activity this subreddit has received since the Beta started. Post flairs/filters, more weekly threads, stricter moderation (the amount of hate speech and alt-right buzzwords on this sub are insane) are all things this subreddit could really use. But I fully understand if the mods weren't prepared for the beta and rise in subreddit activity to come this suddenly, and if they are currently working on fixing these things.
---
Remember when people didn't act like every word was a blood contract depicting the pure unrestrained will of Allah? Down voted for spam.

"I think it was a mistake by Blizzard to obsolete this Content and funneled everyone into end-game raiding"
---
The expansion model is flawed, but it's still one of the best solution at hand for an MMO like WoW.
---
Vanilla too share this issue : how many times at lvl60 did you go back to a lvl 20 or 30 zone and did something meaningful ?
---
There's no easy solution, some only play for rewards and others mostly care about the content. Who are we to decide what should be favoured ? 
---
If anything history proved wow players mostly prefer rewards other content. Iirc it was in BC where players were doing the same dungeon other and other because it was the fastest to farm badges. It wasn't about fun but rather about efficiency and rewards.
---
Same for mythic + in legion/BFA : mobs pack have better design in BFA but it makes then harder to kill and you can't just pack and AOE them, yet the feedback was mostly negative from what i've seen on reddit or the forum.
---
ISFJ - Defender. I am going to main Alliance Rogue focused on both aspects of the game
---
The values this video examines are correct according to the Official bestiary published near the end of 2007. 
---
Agathelos the Raging has a damage of 65-87. This video does not account for the following abilities also done by that boss: Rushing Charge (additional 270 damage on first attack); Rampage (Normal damage +26 and 2.5s stun); Enrage (attack speed by 60% and damage dealt by 52); Left for Dead (Inflicts 200 damage and forces it to feign death for up to 5 min) 
---
The Bonepaw Hyenas he mentions are listed with a damage of 14-19. Note that Hecklefang Hyenas, which are levels 15-16 are listed as doing 21-22. Accordingly, The Hyenas in Desolace are have unusually low auto attack damage, but the values are correct.
---
Either way group content should be buffed. What these Asmon runs have showed us, if anything, is that challenging content with Vanilla's mechanics can be a lot of fun. Unfortunately though, same-level content will be a cakewalk for the average player of 2019. Private servers responded to this by buffing dungeons and raids and it was very well received.
---
Asmongold is such a stupid moronic fuck. Hope he dies in a grease fire.
---
Classic will use the modern API with some functions disabled, so as someone else suggested you could try to write it on retail and port it to Classic later.
---
Someone analyzed the differences, have a look at his threads:

&gt; WoD
---
Yea unpopular opinion here but I really liked WoD , maybe because there was less to do than nowadays and it was more straightforward what could be accomplished.   
---
I raided and farmed reps and have most of my 'epic mounts' from that era,  I'm no hardcore gamer mind you.. 
---
I really enjoyed it. But also I had no job at the time lol and it got me out of depression.

*This is my lowest quality post on Reddit, I think, but I'm gonna stand by it 18 months from now when you still don't have that tiger.*
---
Its possible to do it in like 4
---
I don't agree with how retail is, don't get me wrong, I'm just not one of those "#nochanges" people and I don't think vanilla was a perfect game. 
---
A lot of what made vanilla vanilla was the community. The game 1-60 was a lot more challenging as well, but my critique of early lvls of vanilla is just that it shouldn't be a time where the player is frustrated about missing or the enemy dodging / parrying / resisting etc . Like once you get a few abilities, say around lvl 8 or so I think the mobs should become about as hard as they currently are 
---
When you're level 4 fighting a spider in the Nelf place , it's not uncommon to get a consecutive ombo of "Dodge" "resist" "parry" and die from it because at level 4 you don't have the mana or abilities to make up for the health lost during the forced early level trading.. mages after Nova barely take damage from mobs, but level 4 or 5 a resisted spell  could mean death . 
---
I'm not saying vanilla should be easier, just that early lvls should be adjusted slightly imo. And people are free to disagree , that's the beautiful thing about life.
---
The dressing room feature wasn‚Äôt actually added to the game until patch 1.7, 11 months after US release. Pretty crazy.
---
I'm more interested to know why there are so few tanks in classic.
---
I feel like this is a very mood point. If the values are indeed wrong, its way more likely that its a bug introduced by the new client
---
This guy gets it.
---
the video you link'd the guy that is tanking is level 44 and clearly prot spec (well far enough to have reckoning) 
---
-10 levels above the boar making it grey and hitting for the same?
---
this leans more on barons side
---
This is the same shit that I remember back in the day, that would happen at X-roads. someone pulls a giant dragon and kills EVERYTHING there. People kept claiming it was a GM that summoned it. Oh man, this brings back memories!
---
Yeah I was fooled, I was only picked for the stress test, I played a little bfa, to make my money worth but I was logically bored after a while and I unsubbed. 
---
Yeah the most expensive lottery ticket I have bought and it feels even worse thinking that I have spent money to get that demo as well, which I ended up not playing it. 
---
I was outplayed! üëä
---
They weren‚Äôt more expensive and they won‚Äôt be in until at least phase 2.
---
It‚Äôs wrong so it‚Äôs pretty reasonable to not think about it.
---
I sometimes used these as well. You don't have to be unaimable to not wanting to be bothered 24/7.
---
It always seems pricky when you whisper someone and get this back, but on the other end there is a person who just wants to do some farming but gets constantly bothered for stuff that costs them a lot of time and money. And since time is money it's money¬≤
---
You aren't fooling anyone. You should have started a new reddit account instead of resurrecting your 5 year old one. Add coward to your list of superlatives. It's completely transparent to everyone how irrationally obsessed you are and everyone can see through it.
---
&gt; um... no? they are basically white damage, Debuff is 16 stack so... 
---
Sinister strike and eviscerate are yellow damage.
---
You don't need any debuff slot as a raiding rogue.
---
If you're not among the top DPS in MC and BWL you're doing it wrong.
---
&gt; 2 buttons how fucking exhilarating 
---
It's better to weave shots between auto attacks than just press frostbolt or shadowbolt all evening.
---
Except warrior tanks, nobody has an interesting rotation in Vanilla, hunter is certainly not the worst !
---
What a lovely lad
---
It's most likely accurate but either, way group content should be buffed. What these Asmon runs have showed us is that challenging content with Vanilla's mechanics can be a lot of fun. Unfortunately though, same-level content will be a cakewalk for the average player of 2019. Private servers responded to this by buffing dungeons and raids and it was very well received by the playerbase.
---
I have a ton of stories from my time in vanilla. I can't think of ANY stories from any other expansion and I did play all of them albeit the last 3 or 4 only for a few months each.
---
This is something GW2 did right. The level cap has not increased with the addition of two expansions. The expansion content is added on as an extension of the level capped experience.
---
I can tell one of the following statements is true about you based on your statement above. Which one is it? I'm guessing 3. 
---
1. You didn't play classic on the real servers.
---
2. You havn't tried any of the mythic end game bosses pre nerf.
---
3. Both 1 and 2 is correct.
---
if it wasnt for that broken private server you wouldn't even be able to have a chance at playing classic.
---
Hi, /u/bjoe1443
---
No, it doesn't. And above people linked two MORE videos showing the damage is correct. This has been wonderfully debunked now with actual data.
---
That makes the people claiming the data is wrong like 0 wins and 19 losses at this point.
---
People still play Everquest? Is it any fun? I was still a bit too young to game back when that launched I think
---
its better to just train new pets and save the gold for mount
---
I‚Äôve heard lots of folks praise GW2 for sidestepping a lot of these design problems. 
---
Is the game still active? I‚Äôd be interested in experiencing it.
---
Yeah, seems possible if I correctly understand the system.
---
Did you report it so that Blizz can fix that?
---
WotLK was the most fun I ever had in PvE content. 
---
I think it was because in my original 'vanilla' experience we entered the 'hardcore' PvE game late, progress through Rag, Onyxia, some BWL, then through Hakkar, and then got dumpstered in AQ and everything sort of fell apart...
---
In WotLK I was fortunate enough to have a great guild, progress early and often, and then fucking wipe week after week after week on LK normal (and eventually Heroic). 
---
That shit had me hooked. Every class (from what I remember from class channels / guild discussions / general chatting) felt like they were in a good place, it was just those minor mistakes adding up over the course of a fight that resulted in a wipe. 
---
My first Heroic WotLK kill will be my second favorite moment in gaming ever, just short of me finally getting that second bindings drop to build TF (and then farming the rest of that shit at massive cost to the guild &amp; my own time). 
---
Gods, Classic &amp; WotLK were fantastic for me as a player. Hoping to recapture some of that lightning with the relaunch.
---
This reddit was reactivated for the classic beta idiot. keep spinning this thread with your weird theories.
---
I will continue calling you out on this guides copyright issues/flaws/ no credit to original authors until it has been addressed. you are legit wasting peoples in-game time.
---
Melee can use fishing pole since they are not considered as "weapon" they don't have the same restriction of weapon skill to enemy's defense skill and thus can hit way higher lvl.
---
If you think track hidden will save you from rogues, boy do I have news for you.
---
1. Gold-making ability (Cuz its a new server) - Hunter
---
2. Leveling ability (race to 60) - Hunter
---
3. PvE competence in 5 man - Warrior, Priest, Mage
---
4. PvE competence in the raiding scene - Anything
---
5. most "needed" to validate my sense of self worth - Priest
---
Tanks have to lead so they must know the dungeon and all boss mechanics. They tell dps when and what mob to attack and cc. Also holding aggro is tough especially when you are teamed up with a well geared dps. It‚Äôs tough.
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature!
---
This is a big problem with WoW, and one of the many reasons why I think re-releasing old content will bring them a lot of business.
---
Current Live WoW has tons of content, but a vast amount of it is zoomed past, or only used for transmog runs. Many people never see most of it now. It's certainly not experienced in the pace and glory that it was meant to be. It's bothered me for a while, thinking about all those zones not being experienced to their full potential any more.
---
Weird area. It's a lvl 20-25 for the horde, but alliance go through there in order to get to desolace at levels 40-45+. Created some really unbalanced shit.
---
 "i wanna play rogue, was this class good pve/pvp?"  
---
In their defence (so you don't feel so sad for them)... 
---
I think a lot of people rationalize that gaming isn't a big part of their lives.  So they're happy to get all the good stuff, at the expense of an SO who doesn't approve of gaming, but "who cares I don't really play games anymore".  That's fine if it works for them.
---
I'm with you, though. I tried dating non-gamers, it didn't work out, now I'm marrying a gamer &amp; my life has none of those "No way she'd let me" scenarios.  Of course the trade off has brought different challenges, but at least I get to play my games :D
---
I was the same. My friend got so excited about Classic once it was announced while I was shitting all over it, arguing that it's just an old dated game that wouldn't be enjoyable at all today and any hype he has is attributed to nostalgia. But as soon as the beta started I couldn't help but starting to feel excitement, and it's been growing stronger every day and I can't wait to play it in August.
---
"You sat in queue for half an hour to get into this game? BACK OF THE LINE!"

who?

He wasn‚Äôt even replying to you dumbass
---
Of course I do. I play the same character for 14 years.
---
I did the same mistake than you and I even have a screenshot of me complaining that the weapon is too slow compared to the precedent one \^\^
---
I took the sword because it was the fastest of the 3 rewards !
---
Yes. I know. But thats what I mean, skill ceiling in pve is extremely low in classic. Energy pooling is as hard as it gets for a rogue. Timing shots is probably more skill depending for a hunter.
---
True.
---
For PVE the sword is fine, but for PVP you really need the axe.
---
Its 1.12, so....  
---
1 agi = 2ap  
---
stuff that says "ranged attack power" pretty much only exists so hunters have a chance to get it over better dps slots

Check for appropriate level beasts and humans, check for mob density. Check their drops too.

I just made some characters on a very popular instant 60 private server to decide what class I wanna play. In  pre raid BIS gear I can hardly solo a SINGLE level 60 mob, they are so overturned it‚Äôs insane. Asked in the world chat if there‚Äôs any ‚Äòproper‚Äô tuned mobs so I can compare builds and I got told I was a shitter and to l2p.
---
I don't necessarily disagree, but you haven't really explained your point aside from restating it emphatically several times. Why is the infinite progression model "anti-MMO" and what MMOs have handle expansions well? 
---
Is TBC really the step back, or was it simply following the trends established by the genre already? EQ: Ruins of Kunark added: a new playable race, a new continent, level cap increased by 10, and new content for the new level cap. Sounds familiar!
---
Asmon is definitely not for everyone, I enjoy watching his streams sometimes but I understand why people see him as an asshole, cause he kinda is lol. But I like his humour and he genuinely says some pretty smart and interesting things sometimes.
---
More like "Blizzard intentionally leaving in a leveling exploit for two days, gaining a bunch of subs and then immediately banning those subs again".
---
It has been years since I've read that.
---
yes I agree, separate servers would be the best way to approach this. As the other poster said I could see them doing TBC servers (the only expansion I played, and enjoyed) - preferably a startover one with transferability. 
---
If blizzard was smart they'd make a server for every expansion, not that I care for any of them but it would let people who want them have them instead of the mess they have now. I haven't played in 12 years btw
---
As far as balancing goes, you don't think they will cave if too many players start complaining about something? I wouldn't mind minor patch updates
---
You bringing up mythic proves my point... Almost EVERYTHING is a joke in terms of difficulty. Mythic is the only thing that gives some type of challenge in the game. Anyone who says that retail is harder than classic didn't play classic.
---
I would prolly go Afflic / Demo and Disc / shadow, that way you can just dot  up a ton of mobs and grind super fast as they rot. plus you'll have reasonable heals from the priest and a tank from warlock pet.
---
Your point isn't a bad one but how you make it is so bad
---
World of Starcraft
---
You're right
---
You stop by asking the people who actually play Classic what changes should be implemented post-Naxx. People like to think all of these changes are what led to what WoW is today but in reality it's the truly awful and world changes that really hurt the game like cross server, flying, throwing everything you need in a single room, lfr, etc. You could get rid of all of those things and stat squish to 60 without ever raising the level cap again and retail would be 100x better just from those changes alone.
---
Whats the name of the level 30 beta server?
---
This made me laugh way too much.
---
Honestly, the entire appeal is the inaccessibility.  The fact that things are hard to do and you risk failure constantly makes succeeding exciting.  The fact that gear is hard to come by and rarely very good makes those few excellent pieces feel valuable.  The fact that exploring the world is hard and is made substantially easier by grouping up leads people to form groups and engage with other players.  
---
Vanilla, and by extension Classic, is designed to reward the player's effort, while BFA is designed to shower players with rewards just for logging in.  In a world where absolutely nothing is a threat, all of the gear is functionally identical, everything is designed to scale exclusively off ilevel, and players are forced to seek out challenges for themselves, there is little reason to put effort into the game.  
---
I don't have classic beta access and that's probably a good thing.  If I did, I would probably just stop raiding entirely and that's the literal only thing I care about in modern wow.  It is incredible just how different the games are and how much better designed Classic is.
---
Meyers-Briggs is horoscopes for educated people. But then again, being an INFP, I *would* say that, wouldn't I?
---
Ah yes, I remember using such a modification. I am glad to hear that it's still a thing, will do that as soon as I go back in front of my computer!
---
Lvled a Warrior to 18 on beta, lvling a hunter now and I'm lvl 13. I'm just gonna say straight that lvling a Warrior is such a pain.
---
As any other class, kind of, a group of 3 mobs the same level as you isn't an issue. You'll have to eat, drink, maybe take a health pot mid fight. But you'll manage.
---
As a warrior you kind of almost get 1 of them down before dying. It's harsh. But I grouped up with a priest once, for the gnolls (just north of redridge) around lvl 17 and we killed them with deadness faster than a cucumber.
---
Playing warrior with someone else is strong as hell while lvling, focus on that and it'll be pleasant, not harsh.
---
Current WoW is a bunch of different people's version of the game. Mash it all together and you get an upsetting experience. Thinking about leveling to 60 again is still makes me physically ill that you can now buy a leveled up character for 60$. That's what my YEARS played is worth. Just getting to the end game was an achievement and made me want to play the next expansion because I had already had that time investment in so many characters. RIP current WoW
---
maybe i'm missing seeing these "two MORE videos show the damge is correct" but i don't see where this debunks this wonderfully.
---
Not saying its wrong but just questioning some things that don't add up.
---
I don't think it really matters anymore. A lot of other content creators have stepped up for Classic content.
---
You guys sound great! Exactly what I was hoping for as an Australian with a full time job still looking to raid. I‚Äôll check out your Discord. :)
---
I seriously doubt that drakefang talisman or the hand of justice are obscure.
---
Nice, I had that on my Wishlist but somehow forgot about it. Thanks for reminding!
---
Because it makes perfect sense that the higher level you and your opponents get, the easier the mobs become.
---
Healers will most of the time get easier groups than dps. Priests are good but not god. Paladin are wanted healers so you are fine.
---
If you prefer to heal go paladin.
---
Last time I tried to play wow I had to spec my healer for run speed in an attempt to keep up with people sprinting through dungeons.
---
Paladins are fine for healing 5 mans and raids. The only annoying thing is buffing people with specific Blessings every 5 minutes.
---
All beta characters will be deleted before launch.
---
[Your face after phase 2.](http://i.imgur.com/KHUgIIf.png)
---
I just dont understand people literally pausing their lives to get a slight head start. But everyone seems to hate me for thinking that classic is a fun game, and that hard-core speedrunning it to the max is stupid.
---
But everyone to themselves I suppose. I'll just relax and slowly crawl my way through the levels
---
I wish I was like you, and did not know why smallerk was talking about soy beans in relation to mob difficulty.
---
Study time was so good for gaming for me. I finished so many subjects without even seeing the professor. Make a study plan. It‚Äôs inefficient sitting in lectures. You‚Äôll have to study for the exam anyway. Provided there‚Äôs no attendance check in he classes.
---
same for me
---
Yeah, its cata rework is also displayed on cataclysm behind the scenes
---
[https://youtu.be/A3qDkasFrbQ?t=506](https://youtu.be/A3qDkasFrbQ?t=506)

Seeing as you like peaty/smoky whisky, I'd recommend Lagavulin 16, it's very good!
---
Just call beta what it is: Streamers &amp; Friends
---
&gt;**some** people are having more fun in a "new" game than a one they played every day for many years  
---
More wisdom coming from /r/wowclassic
---
Static. Any changes or innovation based on Classic should be offered as a different fresh server. This goes for TBC/Wrath servers and if they want to just make Classic-themed updates.
---
A ton of people simply didn't care about leveling that much. We today know/believe that the "real fun" begins in raiding and max lvl pvp. That was different back in the days. People spend a ton of time just walking around, chatting, skilling jobs, exploring the area. There was no Meta on how to play the game.
---
I dont think thats true, the biggest and most obvious difference is artifact weapons vs azerite necklace. The weapons where fun and there were skins to farm through achievments, especially the mage tower was a lot of fun. In addition, legendarys altered gameplay and some even completely overhauled your rotation (emerald dreamcatcher), it sucked to farm them just to get a bad one, but getting your bis made the gameplay so much better. World quest also felt more worth doing because of legendarys.
---
Outside of raids and m+ you still had things to do, and they felt worth doing. In bfa nothing felt worth your time except raids and m+,the removal of masterloot also hurt raiding and made it less fun.
---
Imo, legion was a genuinely good expansion. It had flaws for sure but so does vanilla and any other expansion. It holds true that every other expansion sucks though (since cata).
---
I'd recommend you checking out the Big 5 personality test instead of Myers-Briggs, it's much more reliable and accepted in the psychometric community.
---
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
---
Big iron on his hip...
---
Those reasons are made up of crap tbh.
---
Surprise... a lvl 19 boss that specifically hits hard and attacks slow deals more damage to a lvl 21 tank than a lvl 27 elite non-boss deals to a lvl 28 or whatever tank.
---
It be good to get into beta to test levelling routes, spells, rotations etc
---
All the values are off on P servers. You can tell just watching the beta streamers.
---
Another one bites the dust!
---
It's exciting to read stories such as yours.
---
Which is exactly a classic experience.
---
ZA wasn't that bad, ZG was a fucking catastrophe.
---
Yep. Because better gear, talents and higher level abilities make a ton of difference.
---
Dwarf priest.
---
Strong healer, everyones friend, desired.
---
They must, because the game doesn't work with layering after phase 1.
---
That's actually a really smart idea! Just make the new gear, in some way, a requirement for the new content - If they could balance that well and make it work with the rest of the game, then all you need is more bank space and equipment management and you can basically add infinite amounts of content :)
---
Is there any new statement how much that is in numbers? 
---
Except that one in which they said the world was designed for 2-3k
---
how often do you change from sitting to standing?
---
my desk has a built-in timer which I normally set to 45 minutes.
---
Of coarse
---
Okay, so I was correct, number 3 it is.
---
Just to elaborate since you seem to have a hard time understanding anything going on in this world of ours.
---
You cant say classic is harder, and then leave out the content in retail that is suppose to be hard in the comparison. 
---
You are correct in the fact that almost everything is a joke. Its made like that so everyone can see the content, and if you seek a challenge, mythic is there for you.
---
Do you know the tactics for bosses in classic? Its literally piss easy. 
---
Feel free to show me anything remotely close to a proof of an early kill since its only "some type of challenge" now days.
---
Would you say it's welcoming to noobs like me?
---
It most definitely has been a problem. I played in EU during TBC and Crushridge was majority Italian, Dunemaul was majority Turkish, and Burning Legion was majority Polish. On established servers you can just make a level 1 and check out the trade chat, but on a fresh server it's a gamble as to what the majority nationality will be.
---
He was never a good content creator. A dudes unironically sub 90 iq.
---
The point about the debuffs is the same for everyone, but imo it's great because its about planning out your raid comp. You would go oom very fast as enha if you were spamming shocks anyway. There are weapons like nightfall for other classes too, like Ashjre'thul for hunters. But if you don't like the playstyle, just play something else. Thats whats great about knowing a lot about the game, you can pick the role you want to play.
---
Well, "hybrid" can be taken in many ways. The typical 2 are the ability to fulfill multiple roles and the ability to fight both with magic and weaponry (usually melee-centered, even if it's with *natural weapons* \-i.e. feral-).
---
According to the first one warriors and priests are hybrids, whereas the second doesn't consider them to be (warrior is purely weapon-centric, no matter the role they're fulfilling, and the same goes for priest, full spellcaster, even if one if his sides is defensive healing magic). 
---
Pally, shaman and druid fit both.
---
I try to stand as much as possible until I get tired.
---
LOL and now I will be sucked back into Civ 5... thanks ;)
---
Stacking levels and expansions certainly is a flawed concept, to some degree. At some point, problems come up that are probably insurmountable given dev time. There's nothing else to do with that pattern, except keep stacking expansions, zones, levels.
---
I think EQ has something like 25 expansions now, but many players quit after the first 5 - 9 of them. Now their progression servers do far more business than their live servers, which was a smart idea on their part.
---
- Be wize with your gold
---
- Collect dungeons quests before doing them
---
- Yellow quests are more efficient than Orange
---
- A good weapon helps out bigtime
---
- Empty your bags whenever you can
---
- Fill your ammo whenever you can
---
- Repair your gear whenever you can
---
- Hide behind trees if you see the other faction
---
Why?
---
The Paladin mount is:
---
* 352g40s
---
* 10 Arthas' Tears
---
* 40 Runecloth
---
* 6 Arcanite Bar
---
* Azerothian Diamond
---
* Pristine Black Diamond
---
Arcanite Bars can go for anywhere from 50g to 100g.
---
PBDs can go for anywhere between 200g to 400g.
---
I haven't really tried balance leveling, but it's biggest problem is that it goes oom really quick so you have a lot of downtime. But you can do it if you want. Starfire hits hard. 
---
You can use other abilities if you want to for feral (Rip/Rape) but they really don't make much of a difference when you kill a mob in 12 seconds. There will be times to use Ferocious Bite, but it doesn't really matter. But overall your vast majority of your damage is auto attack and Claw. Some people like to mix in moonfire, but I think its better to save your mana for heals. 
---
Another option is to spec into pounce and shred. But this requires going into stealth, which slows you down too much imo.
---
Can someone translate this for me? I'm old.
---
If they thought that was annoying what about the hunters explosive shot? It was like 3 chain linked nukes going off.
---
Same and I played or plan to play the same classes heh
---
It took more than 6 months for me to reach level60 in vanilla. I was playing like couple of hours everyday. The feeling was something that i never felt in any game before.
---
There were no addons, no guides, just rumours and guild chat helping. Amazing days.
---
There a pros and cons. It‚Äôs good to make your decisions considering both - and not rush to a judgment based on one aspect.
---
Play what you‚Äôll enjoy and makes you excited. At the end of the day you can always roll on another server!
---
I read that in the voice of the devil.
---
One of my favorite level zones. On par with Barrens imo. It's gonna be good going back.
---
I agree as a fellow INFP
---
We can't really test much about it at the moment as there are a lot of issues and bugs with hunter pets right now. Once they get those fixed we can get some more solid data.
---
He has fallen too far from grace to ever be relevant again. Most people see him for who he is nowadays, wherever he goes toxicity follows. He's a small, envious, petty and bitter person and his tantrums gets him banned from whatever online community he's part of sooner or later. 
---
Let's just forget about him and move on, he's not worth paying any sort of attention to.
---
Are they the complaints that led to bfa or the complaints that led to burning crusade?
---
Cap at 55 last.
---
Cancer thumbnail
---
Yea the game is still quite active. The expansions do a good job not invalidating any progress you‚Äôve made prior to the expansions or otherwise and there is a decent amount of stuff to do.
---
The gearing/raiding pipeline isn‚Äôt as direct as modern WOW but it is definitely something looking into as there are a lot more open world events that incorporate an entire server community ‚Äî something that I feel WoW never truly tapped into.
---
I absolutely despise the use of the word ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù. However, it is slightly appropriate here.
---
Just let the sub expire again. In the mean time, farm some gold to get a token or two.
---
They should change it. It was a limitation they were unhappy with, introduced a toxic non-rpg metagaming mechanic, which in turn broke certain specs.
---
The gameplay it promoted wasn't healthy and they knew it, which is why they kept increasing it.
---
Even with the 16 limit, the bosses tuned for 8 debuffs will either be undertuned or have to be rebalanced anyways. So it is not a valid argument that unlocking debuffs would necessitate rebalancing - they are needed REGARDLESS.
---
Paladins will have greater blessings for raids.
---
I'm curious as to why anyone would think this would ever happen. Has it ever happened in the history of ever for the release of an MMO?
---
'I have the legendary sword of Arthas the Litch king! No one can defeat me now!' 
---
In Cata:
---
'Oh i got a better sword dropped from a random ass mob'
---
Makes no sense to me lmao
---
and it's dps
---
The streamers are coming up with so many ideas and things to do ... Its amazing...
---
Leta be real, streamers and vanilla was the best combination ao far.
---
Wish they Blizz retcon everything after naxxramas and learn from their last mistakes and just call this, WoW2
---
It really speaks to the class fantasy .
---
Elitism will sadly always exist, online gaming created a monster.
---
It will just be smoother as the game is aimed for patient players with lots of  spare time or experienced players that do not care anymore about being competitive.
---
But we'll see full blown elitism around AQ40 I think.
---
People keep saying the damage is correct, can anyone confirm it?
---
It seems like private servers have like double the damage in dungeons from what i've heard, so either they did that on purpose (and someone would say something) or they got it wrong, or Blizzard got it wrong.
---
If that damage is really 100% correct then it shouldn't be hard to confirm that using youtube videos and such, but it seems like everyone is just saying that it's correct because Blizzard says so. That wont put this issue to rest.
---
Weird no life post
---
Low level leveling might be a hardship due to undead rogues ganking. But assuming layering is going to be a thing and no honour on launch, I dont think that would be happening all the time.
---
But yes, it is welcoming for a noob if youre willing to be a part of groups or look for someone to team up with and show you the way.
---
Everyone loves a dwarf priest.
---
The 15 years of content in retail has been too dilluted.
---
And spreading people out over 15 years of content 120 levels makes the world feel less populated than a small world of 30 levels.
---
Give this man an award or at least make a whole post about it.
---
I suppose I just imagined that there'd be enough players leveling up, needing to progress that it wouldn't be an issue. Perhaps older content raids could just be lowered in difficulty, even just to 5 or 10 man party level content, so that it still has some relevance but wouldnt be impossible to group up for.
---
I don't know about MMOs, but I wasn't sure since both Hearthstone and HOTS beta users got to keep everything. Didn't know MMOs did those things differently
---
Cool thx my dude
---
What the FUCK?  I was just thinking I wanted to play a hunter but would miss mind control on a priest....  MASSIVE if true!
---
The people fighting against this are obviously private server veterans who want their years spilled into playing the same non-evolving game over and over again be relevant here - as they play it one more time.
---
Give us a break. If no expansions came out, vanilla would have had this change in time, and you know it would have made it better.
---
Making up numbers for prices is completely pointless, the only available source is private servers and even there your numbers are way way off. Arcanite bars are going for 20g on the biggest server and pristine black diamonds are literally 1 gold. You‚Äôre a moron.
---
The warlock mount is even cheaper considering a lock can summon for other locks. The warlock mount quest won‚Äôt cost most locks more than 250g.
---
The word you are looking for is "joke".
---
I'm doing battlegrounds on trial characters, level 20, that don't require a sub. Queue times are short. Yeah it's kind of pointless, but I'm just killing time and practicing the controls again. Plus it's free.
---
This is what made me cancel my sub after about 3 weeks of BFA. I love the start of an expansion because generally people don‚Äôt know the instances or are not very well geared, but every single flipping dungeon was done at full speed and nobody ever wanted to mb or even slow down slightly. 
---
Maybe I just got unlucky but after a couple days of this, I just gave up. Even though I suppose I could join a guild or something, I feel that the attitude will always be to just blaze through everything, and I really hate it.
---
Tips is smart, but he's also comes across a conniving average Joe with almost no natural charm. This is no knocking on Tips specifically because most people fit the description.
---
Then we have Esfand who is a genuinely wholesome and likable guy that oozes charm. You like rooting for Esfand because he's real with you and not afraid to be goofy. 
---
That's my take anyway..
---
Would be awesome if they ever did that :) i hope so!
---
But i'm all for "no changes" when it comes to classic. If they start changing even small things, how do they decide what to change and what not to change? It will probably lead to more and more changes, which is exactly what brought the game to where it is today. Why do all the hard work to replicate classic as closely as possible, only to change it again?
---
If they decide to update the game in any way i'm pretty sure they will keep that completely separate.
---
They could be, but they aren't.  And no matter how many times people say "this doesn't feel right!" it doesn't mean it's any evidence.
---
That‚Äôs literally level 30 twinking, which existed in Vanilla.
---
Oh my, a EU player has high ping because he has to connect to a server across the ocean?
---
My my my, how the turn tables
---
I'm not necessarily disagreeing. Bad luck streaks can feel really shitty. But as someone who back in classic was very much in favour of adding conveniences I have come to realize that it is sometimes hard to gauge the impact certain changes have. Maybe these bad luck streak deaths have a long term positive effect that we just don't see. Idk. I agree it feels shitty, but does SOMETHING. And since I am not capable of understanding all the implications I'd rather not ask for changes on this.
---
The only change I'd like to see (see people rage) is the R14 system. Something equally prestigious but less (time)grindy would have been nice. I don't mind grinding, but when winning is about a time investment competition against people with unlimited time at their disposal in a mode that should be about skill I don't like it.
---
But I'm not gonna push the issue. It's gonna be just fine with no changes.
---
Pay to play a beta of a game I already played while everything is going to get wiped? No thanks.
---
You're making too much sense
---
I still have this on my druid! 
---
For some reason it's the only item I ever kept. Everything else I sold for bank space lol (which I'm kinda sad about)
---
Just started Witcher 3 to distract myself from the anticipation lol
---
Yo, fuck this guy!
---
/S
---
Yeah you'll have tons of fun mate go for it
---
They had about 5-6 years of development though
---
&gt; the Big 5 personality test 
---
I just took that test. I think it is a more realistic way of understanding personality, however I don't think that the way I have the data set up that method will work as well as The Myers-Briggs; in terms of categorizing.
---
Thats cool dude
---
sonii looks like one of those prep school hipsters that post on instagram all day and try to get tiktok famous
---
August 13th theyre gonna open character creation for 3 characters to get names
---
Suddenly Cataclism
---
If i decide to do that, I'll use that month to farm gold and get a couple tokens at least. With gold farming I can hang out in other expansions.
---
&gt;This is a big problem with WoW
---
Not necessarily. Karazhan was still run towards the end of TBC. The 'catch-up' epics is what's killing older raids. Why spend effort when you can get it all through welfare?
---
Gold is finally higher than $ again !
---
Some of the mechanics were new in Legion and felt like a nice change of pace. BFA just made everything boring and repetitive. 
---
And I still only lasted Legion for like 2 months and BFA for only 1 :D
---
Exactly! I thibk the biggest failure of MMO developers is their inability to keep content relevent after they add more. 
---
Imagine if retail WoW was split over servers and at max level it copied your character to the next content server. You could then go from 1-120 and go and play all the content in the game as if they were fragments of time. Content is relevant for longer so more people play it eventually, and the need to make it easier for casuals is reduced. It would also fix the time continuity errors in the game. A bit of foreplanning would have kept WoW retail relevant. 
---
Instead you have a pointless journey to max level that everyone rushes so they can play a weeks worth of gated content and then grind irrelevant time wasting content designed to keep them busy until the next patch.
---
I mean debuff slots are a game mechanic...
---
INFJ-T gang representing :D
---
I always played healers in most MMOs but decided to go for a Mage on  Wow. Sometimes I get tempted to play a healer role though, but then I remember how stressful it was/is :')
---
Why everyone loves Dwarf Priest?
---
They are strong or usefull?
---
I played as Dwarf Priest, but i still don't know why everyone loves them
---
Of course people are going to blaze through something if they can. The problem is that it can be blazed through.
---
Also the Classic client is way better polished than the old 1.1.2 client
---
Private servers are all guesswork and should hold absolutely no merit when talking about tuning classic
---
You will rarely do lots of consecutive attacks, but this proc effect jumps rarely so you will be making, also you want slow speed weapons bc they hit harder
---
What about open beta?
---
Yeah frost mage is pretty powerful in 1.12, so is elemental mage with the right gear.
---
You filthy casual
---
GW2? The Heart of Thorns content is still great fun, populated, and difficult. They take the horizontal thing pretty seriously.
---
i got it because I enjoy both
---
I am older enough to remember the days when "game tester" was an actual job people did. As in, if a company wants me to playtest their game and find bugs, they should pay me to do it, not the other way around.
---
yo i had this great idea - what if after naxx is beat, we go to outland and fight illidan? and then come back to azeroth and fight the lich king?
---
It's definitely the worst solo leveling experience in the vanilla
---
what bugs prevent testing ?
---
&gt; Retail is for on rails type gamers.
---
Kinda exemplified by how many people are already asking for all manner of guides.
---
I'm just worried I'll burn myself out playing too much pre-launch. If I level too many things, I won't want to do it again later. :\\ Probably
---
Plus the rest of my life is seriously shit and a lottery win would be pretty handy on that front
---
4 minutes in. When does the insane skill kick in?  
---
    
---
Venruki is multi r1 blizzcon champ etc. etc. so by all standards a top tier player. Yet to see anything out of the ordinary in this video though.
---
He definitely doesn‚Äôt filter his behaviour enough, however, credit to him for sticking to his principles where most content creators would just do what appeals to the masses (which is not wrong either).
---
ISFP - Assertive.  No idea what it says about me, but I'll be rolling Warrior for pve and pvp.
---
You could tell just by playing on pservers.
---
You‚Äôre right. I forgot the developers are giant collage of ACTIVISION BLIZZARD. A living being that has graced us with WoW. And not a bunch of insidiously developers who have sensed left.
---
LOL - Lok'tar ogar!
---
Boohoo poor pirates
---
The Wrath version is still floating in Northrend. I‚Äôve farmed it many times. 
---
Can you do it at level with a group large enough to stand a chance of clearing? No. The only old raid done at level still is Ulduar because it‚Äôs got an achieve for doing so.
---
Nothing changed there
---
To this day I still don't understand why Blizzard doesn't just copy FFXIV's roulette system. Their levelling roulette is a great way to get groups for older content while still giving people good exp and extra rewards at max level.
---
Every single thread has the same comment. You participated in a *stress test*.
---
Because of Fear Ward, an ability only dwarven priests have access to.
---
Yyyyep. Especially warrior tank makes you want to cry before 30. Hunter pets can hold aggro better than you will in deadmines.
---
But then you level and gear and get amazing.
---
Yes because all gear, talents and abilities help you take less damage when your armor has been reduced to 0. Defensive stance damage reduction stays the same whether you are level 10 or 60.
---
Only good tank is warrior.
---
negatory. i can wait. beta is not worth money. game companies that offer preorders with beta access are a cancer of the industry. you dont want to beta test, you want to play. beta testing is boring and mundane and shitty. i have to beta test software at work three times a year for major version releases. its absolutely the most mundane thing i have to do all year. read the axosoft entry for a change to the code or new feature, test that its functional, if it isnt make a note, if it is, make a note. rinse repeat for every. single. change.
---
Ill be on the opposite faction of some specific streamer, ready to lay waste to him
---
Yeah but I hear that you have to be SUPER confident and skilled to really play them
---
Well, there's some leather pieces which have way over average armor. Examples of this are AB PvP shoulders (Highlander/Defiler), Slaghide Gauntlets (Urok Doomhowl drop, BiS until AQ40 if the right affix -i.e. "of the monkey", despite almost any variant is great due to the hefty armor boost-), Nefarian's boots (Boots of the Shadow Flame), Ghoul Skin Tunic (Naxx trash drop, BiS for any feral variant)...   
---
Consider these to have a sort of hidden +armor stat in them.
---
Well, I can't speak for alliance cause I always played horde, so I didn't have to deal with anyone purging my shield.
---
And the reason I mentioned voidwalker is because you have it out for 99% of the time while leveling, and to be frank most people you meet while leveling don't have the skill (also most people don't have engineering) to cc your pet.
---
Of course you don't go around with void as lvl 60. Succubus is amazing in 1v2 situations, and felhunter wrecks any other caster.
---
Anyway, in my personal experience I have never really had a problem killing people at my own level pre 40. Maybe I just played against trash :)
---
It's a good thing 20% of this subreddit is going to fill those tank gaps, according to all the strawpolls we see.
---
Of course the price of PBD is going to plummet once ZG enchants are available. If you think they're gonna be cheap in Classic until then, you're delusional.
---
You would lose a lot of interest in a fresh launch if you have a group of people with a decent head start ahead of the majority of players. The beta is only for bug testing before the official release.
---
Both lead to shit.
---
Top tip - when it talks about social events and interacting with others, I think it wants to know how you feel in those situations when *sober*. My personality test has come back very skewed as I guess I'd assumed I'd have a few beers inside me before having to talk to people.
---
Sure you can. The problem comes whit convincing the other 39 players. And honesty enhancement is probably the worst possible spec in the game. If it was elemental we where talking about I would say go for it prove them all wrong. Enhancement just have to many obstacles. If the role you want to play is mele dps pick anything else and you will have a better time playing. Or pick it knowing you have serious limitations in raids like as mentioned earlier not being able to use all your skills like stormstrike and frost/flame shock
---
Yea they‚Äôre going to go from 400g each to 1g each, that‚Äôs completely reasonable. You just have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about lmao.
---
No. I would turn down beta access, or give it away. We're going to have 2+ years or more with Classic. I don't feel a need to work on a character a can't keep, and I want to enjoy those levels in classic as if they were new. But I understand the urge to play now.
---
If you can get all the data you can do it yourself though?
---
i think you mean it'll be \~authentic\~
---
Yeah, never watched him before, but when he started screaming "KILL THEM ALL", I was like hell yeah.

---
While I can't remember all the details, I'll never forget that patch 1.8 was the Warlock love patch. Notably, this is where Death Coil's cooldown went from 10 or twelve minutes down to 2 or 3. I think Soul Link might have been changed here from a 50% damage split to a ~35% that also provided a damage buff.
---
Just about every patch nerfed Fear, though. Even that one, I'd wager.
---
I wonder if they'll put the visuals in from when they were updated, or like it was originally?
---
plz explain how you would've fought the rogue without taking into account the HoJ.
---
i'm a fast learner, i promise.
---
Maybe their not tanking in Beserk stance as a fury warrior with no shield like I use to. Took me a long time to figure out why dungeons were so hard. You'd think someone else would have told me but I guess they were just as noob as me.
---
What labanski said + dwarves are just bros.
---
Also people playing nelves are usually edgy kids
---
And people playing humans are usually people who see that spirit racial and think of how big their healing meters will be, ignoring the fact Fear Wars would be way way more benefitial to the raid.
---
Yes, it happened, i can give at least 1 example: Skyforge.
---
Fucking HARPIES
---
~~Entire post~~
---
Private servers.
---
Why not both? These problems can both be true.
---
Because i good geared tank warrior can soak more dmg and is easier for healers to keep up. Druids are strong early due to movement and hard to cc but when people start getting geared druids will be blown up.
---
Don't forget to defrag your SSDs!
---
&gt; I know what you mean but I can see classic dying
---
Good. Then they can be consolidated into one or two mega servers. They can even layer them for all I care. It would be much like a sandbox, a way to play with everyone that has a character and a heaven for a more competitive angle of PvP.
---
A bit like standard characters in PoE or non-season characters in D3.
---
In an office you can watch a Racoon eat a hamburger like a person!
---
So I guess your post about healer is no bueno now?
---
Normally the point of an analogy is to make things easier to understand but that just left me scared and confused
---
I think Druid is a fine choice too. The leveling experience will be faster and more enjoyable, imo. While they're not as good raid healers as priests you are still wanted in raids and usually have less players to compete with over gear once it drops. For non-raids you're perfectly fine, only main downside is that you only have a battle res, so you usually prefer to have dps sham/pala/priest in the group. Also more versatile if you ever get tired or need a break from healing, as you can choose to play kitty DPS or bear tank.
---
yearly season servers(ei diablo3)? or every 2 etc
---
&gt;Imagine not even using le meme arrows on rebbit
---
wew
---
While this is true, you must also consider attack speed. You cant just look at raw numbers from single hits. But if elites are doing less dps as normal mobs of equal level, something definitely seems off. I don't have any proof or footage for eitherside tho.
---
Less is more.
---
Warrior is the easiest tank to play by far. If you want a change pick druid they are a bit more difficult to play and that is the only possible options if you want to play tank
---
The server you played on isn't supposed to be blizzlike at all.
---
Do you know if you have to have a subscription to be invited?
---
Well no I still want to play as healer but for the longest tell I only played do so I want to branch out ya know?
---
&gt;  i loved spamming world quests tryna get a Legendary
---
Ugh don't remind me. The way to acquire legendaries was THE major fuckup in Legion. What an awful awful awful awful system. Actually made me quit when I got my third garbage legendary in a row while my guildmates were pulling top DPS scores with their BiS leggies. Awful. Just awful.
---
As much as I liked Legion, the Legendary system was horrible.
---
Their plan was to run into them in order for the dragon to start aggroing them, but it was either reset or bugged out.
---
Best entry level healer is paladin for sure. You spam flash of light until the end of time while bringing very useful tools to whatever you're doing be it raids, dungeons or group pvp.  
---
Priests are cool and in high demand, but are by no means of measure as entry level friendly.  
---
Druids are straight up just not as valuable as paladins, priests or shamans unless you're carrying a flag in warsong gulch.  
---
Shamans also bring a wide range of utility, but they do a lot more than just spam a single spell.  
---
I'd play paladin for sure if you want something solid and simple.

I mean she was killing lvl 52/53 elementals at lvl 59 and still took a while for each of them. I guess she didn't care about reaching lvl 60 and just had fun playing the game.
---
Gifting herself Reddit gold with an alt account won‚Äôt sway my opinion either.
---
Looks nice, i tried the mulgore and crossroad ones
---
I want wow classic even more now :'(
---
Expansions are not additions to the game, they are simply replacements, episodes if you will. BfA only has the content of BfA more or less, everything else is bastardised and ruined.
---
Play paladin and never have to worry about down ranking heals ever again.
---
Yes. Yes it does.
---
If I wanted to hit someone I was chasing in PvP I would have to be *in front* of them.
---
I agree completely, especially the last paragraph. But I would also add that it soon became painfully obvious for experienced players, and in extension new players via knowledge being passed ‚Äúdown‚Äù on forums or hearing from friends, that whatever you did or learned while leveling up to didn‚Äôt really matter outside of maybe reputation, flight paths and, if were being generous, professions in the the later expansion zones. 
---
At least in tbc and to an extent wotlk the game felt more coherent all the way up. You continued on what you did in Vanilla in Outland and in Northrend. Talents were the same just adding more further down the trees and with some minor rework. You had to backtrack certain professions like tbc elixir/potions even in Northrend and some items from old were still relevant post vanilla content. Obviously these things were eventually nerfed like thunderfury and ZG rogue trinket in relevancy at 70 and beyond but things like these felt like they mattered more and were more in line with a Vanilla WoW than the modern WoW. I recall using TBC +armor enchants on items as prot paladin because the armor value was worth defensively than current content enchant alternatives.
---
Nowadays nothing matters in the old content. They even split up professions in different expansion categories for BfA to cement them as completely pointless. Even if you bother to get every cooking recipe in WoD they don‚Äôt scale in any way up to lvls beyond 100. You get new skills in big lvl intervals and talents as well which means you don‚Äôt really feel your class before your all the way up to max lvl in any meaningful way.
---
I would actually like to see this majestic cataclysm castle in vanilla instead of that junky texture hah
---
You're right, we don't know, but here's some substantial precedent: [OSRS vs EoC (RS3) numbers](http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/). Their "classic" DWARFS the new in terms of player interest and time spent.
---
Yes, you also get free epic mount, 500g and a full set of T1 at 60 as a thank you for beta testing.
---
Getting into a group with 4+ people who haven't played Vanilla will be a nightmare at first
---
People pulling and aggroing and everything
---
Why do you assume that a warrior can soak more damage in a PvP scenario than a druid? Druids have higher HP, higher armor, are essentially immune to shatter and slows, and have an emergency NS-Healing Touch.
---
Warriors are tankier in PvE due to their superior mitigation with blocking and parrying. But none of those are factors when your're running with a flag.
---
Really I've been hearing the opposite ppl keep saying how difficult the class can be especially during raiding and such and that you have to be super committed to the class
---
There was a wipe for Hearthstone when it went from closed beta to open beta. The current classic wow beta is a closed one.
---
A lot of people shit on him but if you knew him way back when he started, he was honestly one of the only streamers pushing for Classic (Vanilla).
---
This is a reason I'm not going to use one of those speedleveling guides for Classic. I don't want to blaze through it. I've been waiting for this for a long time. I want to enjoy the journey, read quests to know where the hell to go. I want to get lost, and then find my way. I won't be able to totally make it fresh again, I do remember some stuff from vanilla. I have knowledge of the game in general. But why just blast through it? I didn't sign up to race anyone.
---
FeelsLowResolutionMan
---
Lmao no ones been banned for buying gold in years. Also youre acting like this is the only game people buy amd sell gold for.
---
What class is my main now, or what class I'm planning on maining in Classic?
---
it told me for Priest with 100 hours a week,  ***Wednesday 11 September 2019*** *(this will be 15 days from when you start playing on 27 August 2019).* I only have leave until the 8th September. Guess I'm not hitting 60.
---
As there are only 2 viable options warriors are bye far the best/easier to play as tank. That's not saying it is the easiest class/role to play if you want easy pick something else like a mage. (Talking about pve not pvp)
---
In PVE, tanks in general have a high skill cap compared to the other roles. Playing a class that is bad at tanking wont make this any easier.
---
I‚Äôll buy all your coarse stone
---
I use to raid as resto and PvP as feral back in the day and would respec 2 to 4 times a week. Was pricey but I was able to keep up on it so definitely doable but does take some time.
---
It would have to be much longer than 6 month rotations imo, I would say more like two maybe even three years. Three months is hardly enough time to clear an entire expansion granted we keep the same leveling progression the same as vanilla, don‚Äôt let us level 10 levels in just a couple days as is custom when a new expansion launches now a days.
---
It all depends on how far you want to go as a tank.
---
Up to and including SM, you can tank as a warrior, druid, and to some degree as a shaman, or even a hunter with a tanky pet. It's definately easiest as a warrior or a druid, but I've run early dungeons with shamans and hunters with turtle pets tanking succesfully.  
---
Later dungeons (up to and including UBRS) I'd recommend warriors or feral druids. Shamans might be an option, but itll take longer, and the risk of wipes increases dramatically. I'm not sure about hunters pet tanking later dungeons, you'd need to seek more info on that, if you're interested in that option. I'd not recommend it, enough though most BM hunters are very confident :)
---
Late game, it'll depend on your skills. Technically, you can tank as a feral druid all the way to naxx, as Skarm has showed us. But, I think very few will be willing to dedicate the time to become skillful enough and the ressources to  gear a feral druid for tanking endgame. You're best choise endgame is the warrior.
---
Same, don't know where people got this idea from.
---
To be honest there isn't much to do at Level30. I hope they increase the Levelcap somewhat soon. I don't want to level up another character, that would start to spoil my release-fun when I already leveled everything in the Beta.
---
When I started and was a huge casual even on Horde, I had plenty of 60's want to help or even needed things from the area.   Too many people need to go back for professions.   I will run you, but I get all loot for DE.   Or I'll take all the cloth and you can have the items.  60's fished the fuck out of Deviate fish.   Crafting lower level gear made great cash, especially if it was a twinking/second best for that pvp bracket.    Unlike retail, things don't go obsolete than less than a month.  People will have the rushing moments, but there will be plenty of down time in between.
---
Feral druids have turned out to be excellent off tanks.  They have far superior aoe threat.  They can also tank most bosses in the game.  Albeit not as well as a warrior since they cant totally negate being crit.
---
how is kiting bosses to cities a bad thing? it's fucking amazing!
---
Players know if a game is fun or not. But they don't know what would make a game better.
---
That was because people spent money during the beta, so they got the equivalent in gold when the game was wiped.
---
If you want to tank warrior is the only real option, druids can tank in certain scenarios but the player stigma will hamper you the whole way, druid I would say is probably "easier" in the sense they have a smaller pool of spells that are actually useful while tanking so you end up spamming maul, but tanking is more about situational awareness and less about what buttons you press, so there isn't really an easy class for the role.
---
No I'm not mistaking that.
---
I'm convinced that the reason one of the last quests in the Valley of Trials gives you a Minor Healing Potion is specifically to help with this quest.
---
I'd rather see some specific stats for each expansion. In TBC your gear needs fel resistance to be effective against mobs out there. This way you don't need to level up, you just need to gear up. So your full set of Classic is useless in TBC and of course your full set of TBC has to be useless in Classic.
---
its not that hard.  just a very different playstyle.  in comparison to how complex some classes have become in retail over the years, pressing sunder armour is pretty easy.
---
But really, most of the servers will be mainly English. As far as I remember, only a 2 servers were dedicated to a specific language. So the chances of ending up there are quite low, I think.
---
So it's more or less being comfortable playing with the class and if your not the type of person to be able to adapt and overcome tanking isn't a good class to role?
---
so the people who wanted classic get what they want and everyone who wanted tbc/wrath just get told to fuck off?
---
I don‚Äôt think the issue was the amount of levels, I think it was more so the quickness of the leveling. Sure only add five levels, but make the xp as if you‚Äôre going from 50-60.
---
Yea that attendance check will be vital. Pray for me
---
&gt;No one has fond memories of classic because of how it looked, but because of how it played.
---
Aesthetics can and do affect the user experience for me. How a game looks and how it plays both contribute to the overall feel of it.
---
&gt;Being an elitist over visuals shows an unhealthy obsession over reliving your childhood more than anything.
---
Being an elitist shows a lot of unhealthy things in general. I hope that's not how you perceive everyone in favor of keeping the original art. Maybe you've just run into a lot more them than I have.
---
This IS probably ONE of the MOST clickbait TITLES!
---
Thank you for your time, this is an amazing contribution.
---
There's only certain tier set and gear bonuses that boost them (well, aside demo/BM talents, ofc). Most of them are survival-focused, though.
---
How? How is this question still being asked every day?
---
Are you US or EU? chances are your US tbh
---
The hyena at the end has always been weak. They come in pack of 4-5, the RP reason is that they are starving and are on the verge of death.
---
Regarding everything else. You need to keep in mind that the orge is a boss and that elite really doesn't mean anything with consistency. In addition it hits slower than other mobs. But overall isn't doesn't account to much at all regarding the central point, it does feel too easy.
---
I had this same thought back when i was beta testing for a certain tbc server that got shutdown in 4 hours of launching. The damage values are really all over the place in vanilla and it hurt when i realised that most elites really were that easy after thinking there was a generic 3x hp, 3x melee damage rule for elite mobs. Blizzard LITERALLY have the old database to compare though so what good are memories when they have the real thing.
---
This isn't good gameplay and this isn't why we love vanilla. But this is real vanilla.
---
Private servers got low level elites much worse than high level elites btw.
---
I'd say so yeah, you need to be a leader most of the time as the group rests on your shoulders, adapting on the fly when a something goes wrong is the difference between a good or bad tank imo.
---
If you come up with a better pun, let minnow
---
No, these are the steps:
---
1. Farming run done (Alone ofc).
---
2. Player invite some1 to grp **and promote them to leader**
---
3. Player /camp and wait for logout (or use another command) 
---
4. **after** going offline, **some1 needs to kick you from the group**
---
5. Player logs back in, should appear at the start of the instance with it reset.
---
Grasping at straws I see. Clicking on your nickname and swiping through the first page on the phone takes literally 10 seconds.
---
Sadly this happens with all forms of media (if not almost everything else). The good thing is, these industries self regenerate over time. Look at the indie game revolution of the last few years - that's where the innovation is now.
---
The worst part is, it's happening to the internet now.
---
What are you on about?
---
Crendor has done loads of videos about how he loves Classic Wow, and as far as I know he was always interested?
---
Im Legit confused here
---
Who the hell ever twinked lvl 30s
---
Not only that, but a new patch on retail realisticly removes/invalidates all previous content in the same expansion for a lot of players
---
Due to increased hitboxes, batching on everything, and different mob pathing, you get hit additional 1-3 times trying to hamstring kite, so it's completely useless.
---
At 12 Bucks ?
---
Ok cool I'll keep that in mind thx my dude
---
Why do you write titles like this you fucking gimp
---
Ok but its 15mins so..
---
That's actually a really good idea. You awaken in a new land with new challenges and possibly new skills.
---
Why do you have to do all these expansions on the same character when they can  just keep what works and make new servers for each expansion. 
---
The expansions are all the same anyways in that you are expected to level and get new gear anyways and learn new skills and new places. Just start from scratch. I like it.
---
TILL YOU DIE
---
Humans are only recommended as rogues for pve. For pvp gnomes and dwarfs are better.
---
pog and OMEGA LUL ZULOL
---
Idk, what if from a lore perspective the dark portal closed up after our adventures there? Could of made sense. Or even ran a events or tie in raids to the closing of the area
---
Of course there‚Äôs technically no such thing as infinite progression, *per se.*
---
We all know it‚Äôs just a series of carefully disguised soft resets. So this whole convo is within the context of player *feels* and *perception,* so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll focus on. 
---
A slight tangent‚ÄîTV show writers often say that one of the markers of truly great series‚Äô is that they were written knowing when the show was going to end. They knew where to go and
---
how much journey lay between. 
---
The conceit of infinite progression in a theme park MMO creates inconsistency, , confusion, disconnectedness, and ultimately leads to a situation where power progression becomes so abstracted that its meaningless. 
---
For example: The gear coloring system. Greens, Blues, and Purples each mean something very specific. They each fit certain expectations. They were purposefully designed with 1-60 in mind. Finite power progression. 
---
Until Outland. 
---
Suddenly, a Green from outland replaced a Purple from a month ago. Why? Because Vanilla was not designed with levels 60-120 in mind.
---
Would it have felt differently if they used different colors? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe it has to do with the fact that no matter how much you camouflage it, power resets are *felt.*
---
Since then, every expansion pretends like the gear coloring system just ‚Äúresets.‚Äù 
---
Now, this might now be a bad design in games like Dark Souls, where the sequels are narratively disconnected from each other, but the whole point of an MMO is that its persistent. It has *memory!* 
---
Another example: Dragon Ball Z power levels. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs controversial to point out that power levels, when they were originally implemented, were far more impactful because they were limitird. The system *made sense* because they were designed with that season in mind. 
---
But after enough characters constantly one-upping each other, the whole system falls apart. Who is more powerful tham whom again?
---
The original 1-60 experience was cohesive, in that the player‚Äôs progression flows naturally. It maps onto geography and mob ecology because the low points were designed with the high point in mind. 
---
Sandbox MMOs dont have this problem
---
because they can add expansion content horizontally. See EvE Online, for example. Player progression is disconnected (but parallel to) the narrative and the world. 
---
I guess I should ammend my claim: The illusion of infinite power progression is ultimately incompatible, long term, with theme park MMO expansion content that tries to keep the original core experience evergreen.
---
I don‚Äôt get it...
---
The difference it makes to low level dungeons is nothing though. You should easily be able to tank them with no Prot talent points.
---
The one on the bottom
---
This guy has concerns about rolling a warrior for tanking because it's intimidating. You really think he's going to go farm gnomeregan to get 50 MCPs every week for progression raid content to be a viable feral tank?
---
Nah, sends the wrong signal to Bli$$ard.
---
Or you are tank druid and your armor double as soon as you get dire bear form at lvl 40
---
I'd say SL lock only
---
My apologizes I should have been more clear, I meant has any successful MMOs worth mentioning done it before?
---
Doesn't actually work as a fishing pole, sadly
---
I'm pretty sure that is a boss tactic, but I thought cleave spam worked better for general tanking.
---
Yet the issue is still the same : you could farm higher level zones for a more efficient gold farm and then buy from the AH.
---
You still have lots of people running older content in BFA, especially cata and mop content for professions.  How is that any different ? 
---
I'm not saying no one will do it, but it's similar in BFA. For example when i was leveling my shaman on shadowmoon vale i saw more lvl120 than leveling caracters running around, and they were more friendly than low lvl ones (lots of 5 man elite quests in the area you can't solo as a dps, low level refused to help but smh the first 120 i asked accepted. Guess i was lucky)
---
Venrukis little boys Try to spead his name like Every streamer video in this Classic reddit
---
Yes, if you charge first, you can occasionally kill a random rogue or hunter. But most of the time you're low hp from fighting mobs, and get jumped on with no real means to retaliate.
---
Just a sidenote, but tier 3 was viable raid gear for a good portion of TBC raiding. It wasn't completely replaced until tier 4.
---
[Heres the warrior chest from tier 3](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=22416) 
---
[and here it is from tier 4](https://tbcdb.com/?item=29012)
---
Tier 4 is clearly better thanks to the gem slots, but you really didn't need anything from 5 mans to start raiding with full tier 3 (if you were one of the few people who had it).
---
I've been trying to find more info on this subject - cause I remember the importance of having slow-swing, high-end damage on f.x. Arms Warriors, Enh Shamans, Combat rogue MHs etc - But are you saying that in 1.12, the client we'll be playing Classic on, damage has been normalized so It'll always be better to just go for the weapon with the highest average DPS?
---
Cheers for any links you can provide.
---
Is Zygors addon working on Classic? I was hoping for that, now I'll buy the guide.
---
Sun Rock was great. It's a shame Cataclysm removed all of its quests...
---
Hunter T3 though
---
Not at all. It kind of depends on class but generally monsters get harder, or rather, take longer to kill, the closer you get to 60 and then get easier again once you get level 60 items.
---
For example at level 20 you can buy well itemized blue weapon and 3 shot mobs. At level 50 you are almost full blue and it takes 20-30 seconds to kill one mob.
---
You can't actually use that to hit anything tho
---
They don't pausing their lives. They start living after long slumber ;)
---
&gt; The problem comes whit convincing the other 39 players.
---
That was my point all along. It's really hard to convince people when they hear everywhere how shit the specc is, because all people look at is how much DPS every class can do on a damage meter. 
---
&gt; not being able to use all your skills
---
There are no classes in vanilla that wants to use all their skills, most of them are garbage for pve dps, like stormstrike.
---
If people wanna do big damooges and get all the grills they should roll warrior/mage/rogue/warlock.
---
Then it's just not the same game since many changes are already there.
---
Because. Dae remember vanilla??
---
Same here, what‚Äôs the point in running the same dungeons over and over again at lightning speed. Especially knowing there was going to be a catch up in about six months that would make all the work you‚Äôve done irrelevant. Excited to resub for classic, but I‚Äôm really hoping they don‚Äôt screw this up for us...
---
TRUE LULW
---
You say that but someone love twinking.... they will be the ultimate twins with full T3 gear
---
That's like telling a bling kid, sure you can be a pilot, you can do anything you want kiddo!
---
You could always learn French or German.  Neither language is particularly hard for English speakers to pick up.  And you would learn pretty quickly being surrounded by it.
---
Players only appear in the combat log when they actually perform an act of combat. Other 1.12 addons are able to target players that don‚Äôt do anything or even are afk.
---
Even a primitive `/target` macro manages this. But there is a more elegant way than relying on spamming something primitive over and over again.
---
Version control systems are a thing. They'll be able to review the changes between Classic and the Legion client and compile a list of exactly what changed. Eventually all these kind of bugs will be caught if they look hard enough.
---
Errr I might be alone here but I feel like a lot of his persona is him pretending to be the things you say he is. Like.. you see him break character now and again. It's most evident when he says he's going to wreck something/someone with 0% chance of doing it and then acting surprised and saying the game sucks.
---
Im against faction change. Also against name change, unless you move to a new server.
---
Also servee changes should have like a 6 month cooldown like it had.
---
You cook the rice with chicken and vegetables at the same time? Also, which vegetables?
---
He is so fucking cringy
---
I love how Guild Wars 1 handle the expansions. The base game max level it 20, and the expansions don't add more levels, so it's always 20. But the expansions feel refreshing with new maps and history and adventures.
---
Also each expansion have it's own new starting zone so you can start a new character in that expansion zone if you want(Similar to monks). You can reach level 20 very fast, like in 1/4 of the main campaign. That means that the content is focused on the level 20.
---
The best thing is that all zones, even the zones from the base game are challenging. The Fissure of Woe is a endgame dungeon that was available on the base game, but it was still popular and challenging in the last expansion so all the content is relevant in all the expansions.
---
Never played Vanilla myself, you're not alone!
---
Why does this sound like an Idea of Elon Musk?
---
I want tons of changes. I am absolutely not in the majority of people here who want everything to be exactly as it did in 2004. I hate BFA like everyone else here and think that Vanilla, even in it's absolute old form with #NoChanges is better than BFA, but I would still like to see improvements over all of Classic. I don't want any of the fundamentals of the game to change, I don't want it to turn into BFA, but there are tons of improvements and changes they can be made and still keep the spirit of Vanilla alive in design philosophy while giving everyone a BETTER experience for it. A nostalgic experience is cool, but I'd rather just have a superior experience to retail at the same time than just reliving what I already did.
---
#--------------------
---
#Things I want:
---
The biggest thing I want is balance changes. I want to be able to Boomkin, Ret, Enhance etc. in raids and not be forced to go heals if I want to take that class in there. Obviously Blizzard has done a fairly piss poor job of balancing classes from the begging and still can't balance classes if we are being honest, but since we are talking about our fantasies here, then balanced classes and many changes to accomplish that is what I want.
---
I love collecting mounts, one of the few decent things about retail, the collections tab. I don't think having mounts in your bag provides any benefit or purpose to the game. You can keep the 3 second+ cast time and low amount of mounts available, I'd just like to have a collections tab.
---
Updated graphics, models, animations etc. I love Orcs and have been playing them since Vanilla, but I'm fucking tired of their broken backs. I want my straight-backed Orcs, more attractive-looking Troll females etc. from retail. Classic looks fine because it's stylized, but it's still 2019 and I'd rather at least have a 2010-looking set of models than a 2004 one. This is one that gets a lot of pushback despite not actually effecting the gameplay like my other suggestions, so I am always surprised when people scream #NoChanges over it. 
---
I want an LFG system BUT, stop, hear me out. Don't. Unclick that fucking downvote button until you finish reading my post you son of a bitch. I don't want retail's LFG system AT ALL. That is terrible. I want one that will pair me up with ONLY people from my server. It doesn't teleport us all to the dungeon or anything like that. It simply saves us from having to yell in trade chat for hours to form a group and then run to the dungeon FROM town. We can be wherever we want and when enough people from OUR server are found, it forms us into a party. That's it. We can then talk to each other, decide when/how/what to do and go from there. This goes without saying, but it does not work with raids at all and never should.
---
#---------------------
---
#Things I don't want:
---
I don't want transmogging though. The only reason I don't hate transmogs in retail is because the fucking raid tier is so garbage that I'd rather it be a system in the game than have to wear some of that ugly shit. But it's a catch-22 thing, if there wasn't a transmog system in the game, they would spend more time and resources making good looking raid tier, but since everyone just transmogs old sets anyway, they don't bother anymore and just do armor tiers rather than class tiers. Fucking gross.
---
No layering. I know everyone bitches about layering, but the truth is it really does destroy the old school community feel that you can't get in most mmorpgs anymore. I don't want to phase about and only be guaranteed to be in my friends phase. I want to meet the same people over and over. If Fuccstick, Crabman, Bigbilly, Slyanus, Loktarogar etc. are all leveling at the same pace as me, I want to see them running past me in the same zones most of the time. I want to be able to form a bond with them even if I am antisocial and never actually will. I like knowing I could though if I wasn't retarded.
---
I'm going to lose a lot of people here too, but I don't want to have my bags full of ammo and reagents for spells. I think it's dumb. I didn't like it in vanilla and I won't like it when I come back. Idk why everyone's dick is so hard over managing inventory, but it's not truly fun. I get that people want more challenging shit, I do too, but it doesn't need to be with my bag space. If Hunter ammo actually did something besides add flat dps, that would be a different matter. Using elemental ammo against mobs that were weak/strong against it, having arrows with small chances to proc slow or bleed or something would also be cool, but ammo as it is would be entirely fucking pointless.
---
I don't want flying mounts ever. I say this as someone who loves flying mounts, they are fucking fun. Flying over entire continents and over mountains and over mobs without aggroing is glorious. It also ruins the entire game. It makes leveling infinitely faster by allowing me to skip aggro and traveling time, it makes world PvP nearly obsolete because whenever I finish my objective I fly safely in the air, and lastly, it means we never get any jumping puzzles, easter eggs or rewards for going to hard to reach places. As much as I love flying, it trivializes the game and heavily effects design choices of the game going forward after its inception.
---
#----------------------
---
I'm not proofreading that shit, so if I made a spelling mistake or error, fuck you. Also, there is no TL;DR down here, fuck you again.
---
1 fap does the same thing as shifting and line of sighting a mage when clear from mid wont be to hard, the resistances that comes with better tank gear or pure crafted resistance migates some spells, Warriors will have a harder time getting mortalstrikes on the prot warrior due to block/parry, the protwarrior and healer combo has great synergy and moves togheter.  
---
But in the end all it comes down is gear/playerskill and preference for the comp you are playing with.  
---
Meta will change with avaible content.
---
i‚Äôm sure there are ppl better versed in the lore that could flesh out the cause and effect of different things than i could. wouldn‚Äôt mind after classic getting wow 2, revamp with the new timeline. 
---
same lore characters we love but told in a different way. also make garrosh the leader he was meant to be... maybe have saurfang the younger survive the wrath gate and become his second in command.  maybe we find pandaria never defeated the mogu and the mantid are a much bigger threat and the only way we take pandaria for the pandaren is by taking advantage of the war between mogu and mantid. also wouldn‚Äôt mind having azeroth handle it‚Äôs shit before we go out into the universe. would love to see the united horde and alliance just going planet to planet saving worlds and chasing the burning legion/void. having sargeras see what we have accomplished and deciding we have a chance to defeat the void and old gods. 
---
i love the what if storylines so much. also i feel like there‚Äôs a ton they could do with having it go wotlk (bfa as a huge content patch during wotlk) then go into cata bring in the kultiran and zandalar as races from last xpac , have goblins and worgen brought in during wotlk maybe. then take all of our combined azerothian power into BC where we bolster outland and set up a new home base that we use as the starting point to take out the void infested worlds. then dranei and blood elves are brought in beginning of the next xpac after  BC with the demon hunter class.
---
Wanted healers. Peculiar wordage. Begs the question,  what is an unwanted healer class?
---
I suppose thats true.  You dont have to farm them but it does help.  Druid would give the guy more options should he decide that tanking isnt for him though.  All three other specs are also viable.  However moonkin and cat require alot of consumables to be subpar mages and rogues.
---
It's possible that too many players were logged in and it had to create another layer and some people from the first layer were moved with it so both layers were populated enough. But I haven't read anything on it, just an assumption.
---
Was it really possible in vanilla to kite something like this into the city? Or is that a bug? :D
---
I gambled too, but lost :) 
---
I dunno even if i have a slightest chance as a european and non streamer, but my hopes are still up :)
---
People that played before they changed the brackets to exclude multiples of 10 from the lower tier.
---
Well, no?
---
Imagine if expansion is for each 10 levels in vanilla, so 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40 etc. Did you need LFG to overcome it?
---
No, so it doesn't matter if it's 61-70 or 21-30.
---
Besides LFG and other mechanisms introduction, expansion is just about new zones to get higher levels.
---
Problem is that introduction of expansion blizzard intended to rush content in between to reach it. This ended up with a problem you are wondering how to solve it. I believe this was a bad move as it leaves not currently focused content simply worthless.
---
1) OK, Sum durids is bare

---
Credit as always to DRUIDTEECHER Alamo
---
And then you realize that you don't have a pocket healer and everyone just let you die in the battlefield because you're not a streamer. xD
---
You can't block a Mortal Strike, unless the arms warrior is using a dagger. Block just reduces the damage taken by your block value. My point with parry was that the people trying to kill you will be hitting you in the back, where you can't parry or dodge.
---
Why bash on him? He‚Äôs right. This shits already getting old fast, a three month beta is going to kill a ton of hype I‚Äôm sure of that. I can‚Äôt wait for classic to come out, but prolonging the beta that most people can‚Äôt even get into is stupid. As he said, let‚Äôs see who gives up first especially if they don‚Äôt raise the level cap. Numbers are already dropping on twitch.
---
He's not an asshole. What makes you say that?
---
He's got many flaws and his community is really bad (as is every twitch chat) but he does make good content. His classic beta stream is just simply the best of all the streamers out there. You can't even argue about that. All the crazy things he's done was so fun to watch even if you don't like him.
---
My native tongue is actually Swedish and I did take French for 5 years in school. I guess I could try to continue learning French but I always found that the grammar was kind of difficult. Also they speak way too fast normally for me to understand anything :D 
---
I'm very shy so speaking in a language I can't quite pronounce nor understand fully is very difficult for me. I feel too embarrassed!
---
But thanks for reminding me of that option!
---
Yes you could lol
---
Oh, is it that shit about abreviating dungeon names? And I got downvoted for not understanding it? Lmao
---
Druid&lt;Priest&lt;Shaman
---
ofc
---
Yep, after a couple of "For the Horde!"s you just kinda end up laughing maniacally, magic in those words.
---
I (Soul Link vanilla warlock) never lost to a Rogue if I had my Succubus or VW out, which I always did. That matchup was always wildly in my favor. I had them popping mad consumes on me and they'd still go down hard. Sometimes it made me wonder if SL was OP.
---
Honestly, classes with big sustain - druids in particular - were a lot more trouble. The very few who were clever enough to prioritize keeping themselves alive would eventually get me to lifetap low enough to where I had to plant myself and switch to drain spam. For the enemey, that tends to be a lot more manageable than a kiting, fearing warlock. Those engagements would proceed through multiple distinct phases and sometimes last for upwards of 7-10 minutes.
---
God, I miss Vanilla.
---
Pug means pickup group, party made ad hoc without the intent of sticking after being done with dungeon/raid. From pug theres this verb, pugging
---
Its not a shady business model, in fact its not a business decision at all.
---
Restricting beta access to active subs that opted in is a fairly smart away to assure it goes to the right people.
---
Its a very small beta and if any invites missed the mark, that leaves an account to be sold creating a market that shouldnt be.
---
The same thing goes for the 14 day advance naming, if they opened it to everyone even without sub people would be hogging names at no opportunity cost. In this case i wish they would just give everyone 14 days of gametime when they buy a sub tho.
---
Giving tons of invites to streamers and very few to everyone else, now that's a business decision. One I don't much care for but can understand.
---
thank god no.  
---
If they did that, that's just stupid.
---
Beta is for testing purposes.
---
Now they invalidate content by the patch. For the last 8 years actually. You havent ever had to do content that wasn‚Äôt released on the current patch. That‚Äôs a mistake too.
---
Get fit before Classic comes out so you can let your self go again.
---
They are using the old tables and converting them to the new format, how would they be wrong??
---
The only thing that can be wrong is how the damage is applied, which I doubt since they have already debunked people claiming wrong damage on specific mobs.
---
This can, did, and will be done on servers regardless of whether or not a steamer is present. Yes, these player made events are fun (for most) but their occurrences date back 14 years.
---
In other words, don't base your decision on a steamer reproducing something that was done many times before. You don't need a steamer for things like this to happen on your server. Even better... you can take the initiative to start it yourself. That is even more fulfilling.
---
What lotteries do you people partake in that 12 Bucks is the most expensive ticket ?
---
So basically no one
---
THIS is it.
---
Wish I had a beta key...
---
Just the ability to be challenged to tackle instances RFD, SM, Uldaman,... being capped at level 30 - what an awesome new expansion!
---
+dramatically drives you to bond with people from this small beta pool in order to overcome the new challenge.
---
PS: Petition to release "WoW Classic beta classic" servers?!
---
They only say they would invite less people now because the demand is pretty much met.
---
Now you're just memeing
---
No LFD/LFR, check. 
---
No annoying flying mounts, check. 
---
No annoying BE pallies and, well, annoying BE in horde, check. 
---
No easy as hell heroics (specially WotLK-post-nerf Cata, can't say much for MoP ones) and well, no heroics crap, check. 
---
No daily stuff, check. 
---
PvE and PvP doable in the same gear (no resilience, pvp-power or whatever), check. 
---
No arenas, check. (Yes, I'm not a fan of arena-centric gameplay)
---
WPvP galore, check. 
---
But well, Classic/Vanilla is far from perfect. Grindy (which is a bonus for some, though), class balance being quite poor, PvP ranking system being an ultimate grind, hybrids being punished hard for being so...
---
Eq2 also has the option to slow or stop exp gain, or set your level to the area as long as its lower then your Max. So you can sit in a level 10 area all the way up if you want. Which means experiencing what you want how you want and the pace you want.
---
Definitely wasn't the case for me (Based in Belgium myself) and I doubt anyone else who is still playing retail. However there were enough other non-technical factors that drove me away from retail.
---
Tldr; sounds like that issue is unique or on your end.
---
Do you think Blizzard is in denial of this, or wholeheartedly embraces it as an integral part of the experience? 
---
You mention Eve as an example of how to expand horizontally, but it's only capable of doing this BECAUSE it isn't a theme park MMO. So how does a theme park MMO like WoW or Rift expand horizontally, when the whole point of the game is to progress via gear and levels?
---
If they go down the route of expansions, I think the latest they should go is WotLK. One of the reasons a lot of people wanted Classic was to see the old world again. Cata would throw that out the window. Not only that, but WotLK and TBC end the major story lines from WC3 at a really nice place.

I yelled at the tank that he take too much damage compared to the other players... I was the healer.
---
It's mindboggling to me how many people on this reddit say that.
---
Do they just repeat the anti paladin memes? Or have they played a different vanilla than me?
---
I did. On vanilla I played BGs most of the time on one character, then level him up 10 levels trying to get BiS manily from dungeons, then played next bracket of BGs again for quite some times.

Ah i didn't know you were Swedish.  That would make German and French a little harder i suppose.  Although if you could master our lawless language of English im convinced you can learn anything lmao.

&gt; Well, no?

You‚Äôre comparing apples to oranges.

This would only make sense if they also *removed* Vanilla content and stretched the pacing of expansions to fit what was removed.

You still haven‚Äôt solved the fact that we have 120 levels, all designed to be traveled at different paces, with different mechanics, and different endgames.

Rip zg. Didn‚Äôt know about ZA
---
Everything against Russians on European game servers.
---
I just hope there won't be too much generalization in classic. If I were to play on alliance I probably would roll night elf for RP purposes and try something silly like arcane priest while I'm at it. It would be downer if those players would be denied because they didn't minmax or think common good when they created the character.
---
That aside I'll go for troll priest and eventually make warlock tank as well. I'll look for friends who want try similar stuff and enjoy their time to fullest. Not just faceroll the content and leave the weakest behind
---
Wait, 1-13 human, if that takes you to iron forge then dun morow quests then loch Moran, that‚Äôs joana‚Äôs guide
---
Do you know how many layers exist on a server at the same time?
---
The least wanted healer is a druid. These are the worse to stack in raids.
---
In other content the class matters less. But druids also dont have a ress.
---
And thats the kind of shit you get with streamers.
---
&gt; The truth is WoW has catered to a small but very loud whining minority for years. 
---
They catered to a majority. We are the minority. Modern wow is pop-culture, designed for the biggest common denominator. Activision is pushing for an as big market share as possible.
---
It's just that niche stuff is always better, because mass appeal always comes at the cost of character. Everything is formularized and streamlined so that everyone can enjoy it TO SOME EXTEND. 
---
But niche stuff will always be enjoyed extensively by the people who love the niche and they can be so much bolder with trying out new stuff and doing shit that 90% of the world's population wouldn't enjoy (mindlessly grinding for hours).
---
Mass appeal is awful, but it IS for the masses. Insinuating that our weird taste is somehow the silent majority seems misguided.
---
Before most people get to 60
---
I was far from the first person to Twink my character at level 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60.
---
And yet: I still did it.
---
Thanks for your comments; they‚Äôve been real productive.
---
The sub numbers disagree with you.
---
Yeah at 28 OP is still a kid himself.
---
You might be thinking of Hallow's End, but the idea sounds pretty dope
---
I love the idea of tuning tbc content to 60, progress through your raids/dungeons get some nice flashy gear and then continue the adventure onto the next dungeons and raids in tbc. If people want to leveling again, maybe make it to 61, but with the experience of 55-60 or somewhere near. That way level 60 content isn‚Äôt completely dead on launch, and people have a reason to still raid and what not because they don‚Äôt instantly overpower the previous content.

Haha, that's just great! I'm curious, does the pole work with feral druids?
---
this guy's most visited subs are no surprise to anyone.
---
FFXIV solved this with LFR but that isn't going to be very popular here
---
&gt;In this video however, we can see a level 31 elite in RFK dealing 70!! damage into 0 armor !! 
---
what were you expecting, 500 damage from a level 30?
---
there is nothing wrong with current mob values, they are exactly the same as they were 14 years ago.
---
From the outside it had some good points and felt interesting(I did leave during Cata, so no MoP disappointment for me) but the blows dealt with Cataclysm (LFR, heroics being nerfed shortly after release into mindless wotlk-like ones, talent tree changes, EK/Kalimdor revamp and, personally, some playstyle changes -used to be enh, hated the searing totem+lash mechanic-) were too much to consider getting back to it.
---
But the whole point of the Paranoia addon is a passive detection system - the /target macro is just the icing on the cake, so that if an enemy is detected you can click and target said enemy. 
---
If there are other addons that can passively detect the presence of an enemy player that is more efficient than using the combat log, how do they accomplish this?
---
They've already said this in press conferences... or you can see it right now on the beta.
---
You know, that thing that gets posted on here at least 5 times daily.
---
You mean 1 year of content since everything prior to the this expansion is irrelevant. Actually its a few months of content since every raid makes the previoud one irrelevant.
---
It's a huge pet peeve of mine and I really hope it doesn't stick
---
They can add new content, just keep it lvl 60! New gear and mounts, but nothing that is better than the old stuff. Just different stats.
---
A meme is a cultural subject that spreads organically in society. These are inside jokes, pretty much the opposite of a meme. They are meant to only have their full meaning to a select group of people.
---
I would say the right word for Classic is punishing. It heavily rewards preparation, cautiousness, patience and (self)awareness. If you die then its never because the game is too hard, but almost always because you got cocky and didnt use all the tools available to you.   
---
And thats the beauty about the game. You set your own pace and your own difficulty and the game rewards you in one way or another.
---
weapon speed matters, as well as boss mob etc.
---
TRIGGERED BY WORDS LULW
---
Dunno if you'd call it fun, but the the Water Totem quest line is certainly iconic. Maybe the Shredder Manual in Ashenvale, because one page collecting quest wasn't enough. Killing off what amounts to that entire human village in Hillsbrad? 
---
I think the equivalent of The Hermit for horde would be the Helcular stuff, but he just doesn't have same impact tbh.
---
Paladins are great, but there will be no shortage of them in raids. Roll priest, you will be very highly sought after for both PvE and PvP and the class is actually fun.
---
Well, we can just wait and see if they ‚Äòfix‚Äô this ‚Äòbug‚Äô but my belief is that they won‚Äôt, not right now in any case. If I‚Äôm any judge, they will wait until the population has settled before adding it as a ‚Äòbug‚Äô fix in a patch.

Welllp time to listen to the Marty Robbins gunfighter ballads album again!

Yea I recently created a new character and I have 20ms, and I still have delay on spells, looting, writing in chat (this one is particularly bad, like 3 sec delay sometimes). It is really frustrating.
---
The lag seems to disappear in certain areas though, but starting area and places like tirigarde sound lags a lot.
---
Yeah.. I feel like they released beta WAY too early. I think it‚Äôs going to hurt hype..
---
Moron
---
&gt;Sandbox MMOs, like EVE Online, don‚Äôt have this problem.
---
Skill injectors beg to differ :( Worst thing that ever happened to EVE Online and is essentially that games way of "skipping older content" aka. instead of newbie frigate fleets new players these days go to Delve to make isk such that they can inject themselves right into capitals.
---
Well, I personally enjoy helping new people.
---
Warriors in defensive stance have a passive -10% damage taken from all sources. That is what makes them superior when it comes to soaking damage from all sources.  
---
Using this logic other candidates would be Shadow Priests but for them it's physical only and Warlocks with Soul Link but that can simply be dispelled or removed by killing their pet.  
---
Of course Druids are still the best flag carriers by far, soaking damage isn't nearly as good as not getting hit in the first place.
---
I disagree. If anything its the opposite. This can learn from the level 29 twinks guide and not the other way around. The 29 meta has been fully explored pretty much so whatever changes from 29 to 30, changes because it doesnt work in 29s anymore like an item requiring level 30 to be used.
---
Hey man no more trade secrets here aight?
---
Exactly, i also have no problem guiding ppl that are new to the game and help them out. Serves a better community and server experience!
---
INFJ-T/A 50/50 split. I still don't know what to play for classic. :(

*\Mob teleports behing you* *Nothing personnal man*
---
90 days... I just got a genuine shiver down my spine.
---
Actually a pretty common complaint and why you don't see any week-respawn world bosses anymore.
---
I made a post on the old wow forum a month or two after tbc launch saying that I'd rather stay on vanilla. Ideas about vanilla servers only came in wotlk I believe.
---
&gt; I don't work in a office so that might not be accurate.
---
Well, I don't have a pet raccoon, but I guess I know what you mean.
---
I suppose a hidden or surprise lesson from this for the Classic team may be that, even beyond bringing back Classic as a thing, there is some inherent underlying gameplay value in the broader concept of "progression" servers, as a thing distinct from "legacy" servers.
---
So Classic will be a snapshot of the game as it existed at the end of the first development era. But what's happening in beta right now is that a staged pause in progression at a point short of the usual level cap has allowed the entire community to look around and think about gameplay in a slice of the game that few ever stopped for long to appreciate before.
---
Yes, as others pointed out, things like 19 and 29 twinking existed back in the day. But this is something different, because it's an entire server full of 30 twinks, with everyone doing it, and with people exploring every niche of all the content and activities they can attempt, and how far they can push their builds, within that constraint.
---
The whole idea of having a realm that starts fresh, with a full wipe, and pauses at certain level caps before reaching the final destination, is something maybe they should keep in mind for the future as a gameplay mode in itself. You can think of it as a bargain basement sort of "league" play, where everything is reset, and everyone gets to compete again to see how far they can go, and how fast, starting over from zero.
---
When, inevitably, the game that is fixed forever in a certain era starts to get a little stale, having some "league" or "progression" servers set aside to do this sort of rinse and repeat staged progression on could go a long way to keep things fresh and give people a reason to come back or stick around. They could even play with this concept a bit by introducing some wacky server-wide buffs or gameplay mods that only exist on the progression server, and only last for one round or reset cycle, and then get swapped out for something else equally weird, but entirely new, in the next reset.
---
It's friendly to any type of gamer. There won't be any 8.2 patch that invalidates everything you don't prior to it. You don't even have to reach 60 to actually play the game and do interesting stuff with the realm community. When I went to check "vanilla" after announcement it took me around 13 days /played to reach 60 on a Shaman which isn't anything fast by nowadays "standards" if someone would want to powerlevel.
---
20h is more than enough. You won't be super quick to 60 but you could raid with that much time
---
1-5, q, e, r, t, f, g, x, z. Then all those with Shift and Ctrl or Alt, it's preference.
---
I use the same binds on all characters, and then interrupts and such are always E, hard hitters are always F, healthpot/HS is always Alt3 etc. I used to click a lot in vanilla but have since moved on to keybinding everything except professions.
---
I'll post the same thing I had to post in the multiple spam threads made to promote this fake news on the WoW forums.

Maybe the bluepost announcing the beta and saying that you need to be subbed threw them off
---
You have three options: 
---
Modifiers, special hardware, or completely redoing your keymap to centre around ESDF instead of WASD.
---
Or you can click. Don't do that for anything you might use in combat, though.
---
I played lock with a heavy PVP focus and had everything bound.

I don‚Äôt recall 50 keybindings though.

So I figured I was going to try and see if there was a simple hit % (miss reduction) calculation, and as I remembered it doesn't.

---
The second post is interesting though:  
---
&gt;I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs useless.  
---
 Let‚Äôs say you increase your weapon skill by 4.  
---
 Against a mob 3 levels higher than you, you get: 0.8% lower chance to  miss, 0,4% lower chance to get dodged, 2,4% to be parried, and a 0,8%  higher chance to crit. That means a 4,8% net increase.  
---
This would apply to all levels. While I get it to 4%, maybe I'm missing something. It's still a huge boost.  
---
Also considering low levels largely depend on white hits, reducing the chance to miss, dodge, parry or get blocked. Is huge, even bigger when considering you always have 40% glancing blow on those hits. So making sure you hit most of your whites is very important.
---
Now the question is if every one get the same increase in stats.
---
Considering I‚Äôm 9/9 M, I think I would of lasted more than assagolds‚Äô fans. Especially after they mail all their gold to assgold.
---
Seems like unintended behaviour at first glance, report it to the team.
---
&gt; I would much prefer layering in retail where your layer is mostly populated by your own realm (if you're on a high pop one) and only splits when overloaded. That doesn't revert any QoL changes in retail.
---
I don't think that would work at all. Over the years most realms on retail fluctuated and are dominated 90%+ by one faction, also some realms are literal ghosttowns and only crz and xrealm keep them alive.
---
wish they would just buff all elites makes the game much more fun.
---
I've been playing with 4 other people in discord every day, I don't know what you're on about. Its an MMO finding people to play with is easy as fuck.

Why? Cause of Escape Artist and Stoneform?

Isn't damage still good?

Don't get me wrong, I'm going to play dagger, so still going Gnome. But I want to know why :)

vanilla had simple letter substitution for the faction languages, so you had addons that would encrypt what you said to look like trash but for alliance would come out as english

Classic is for everyone that enjoys it, you probably won't be able to clear all the content and certainly not high pvp rank but there's still a lot of content for you to enjoy while levelling and endgame.
---
As for levelling there isn't really an answer for this as it depends on how you decide to level, if you choose to try and speed level at 20h a week it would take about 6-8 weeks for a less experienced player, or you could stop and smell the roses, complete some fun quests and try to do all the dungeons ect.
---
Used to have an addon that auto-equipped your carrot and riding gloves, mithril spurs, etc. when mounting. It would switch back to your regular gear when you dismounted as long as you weren't in combat. You just had to make sure you dismounted before starting a fight, or you'd end up fighting with your riding gear on.
---
And of course, fishing buddy, which is still around, would equip your+fishing gear when you equipped your fishing pole among lots of other great things.
---
What does that have to do with the pserver having incorrect data?  So tired of that defense.   "Oh they made the game possible hurr."  Ok great, but that doesn't put them beyond reproach.
---
No, they haven't given out details on that. At least 2(1 for each continent) and that 1 layer can hold around 3-5k players( I believe)
---
BIS for Paladin soloing.
---
20 hours is more than most. Its enough to be semi-hardcore and clear most raids. Maybe even all.
---
To reach level 60 depending on class and playstyle it will take between 6 and 12 days /played. 
---
6 with a good class, route and no distraction. 12 with a bad leveling class while also working on proffeccions, goldfarming and some PvP.
---
Classic wow is the MMO made for casuals compared to other MMO's from its age. Low penalties and alot of meaningfull progression.
---
Which is why I'd love the option to XP lock in classic. Would take twinking brackets to a whole nother level! Unpopular opinion, I know.
---
Spent 2 hours pulling Anachronos all the way from Tanaris through Thousand needles, Feralas, Stonepeak mountains, Barrens and Durotar to Ogrimmar just to have him killed within 2 min and give me 500 minus rep with  brood of nozdormu and making me facepalm ofc im fucking my AQ rep.... (were still at war with them)
---
keep us updated if you make any progress!
---
This. Pserver players Sony have a clue about actuall vanilla from back in the day. Either they didn‚Äôt play it or their memory is skewed by playing on pservers to long.
---
Ofc it does thats the point of AP
---
I think the legendary system was good, they just made them too necessary. The legendary effects should have just been QoL effects (like that Warrior one where you get 3 heroic leap charges)

Desolace was another zone I liked üôÇ

Why is there a Death Knight on your meters??

AMERICA EXPLAIN
---
...I equipped cloth and items with int on my first rogue. I thought it would be better to wear something lightweight for his mobility. Int of course, because you gotta be smart and sneaky as a thief.
---
Well i do the same, not necessarily asking how to keybind, but even if you bound all of those on a warlock including engineering teinkets and potions, pet commands (some of them) etc it wont be enough. I can have enough with my mouse but i will end up with some many keybinds that i just feel like not playing the class anymore, i know it will take me longer than i want to memorize everything.
---
The sad thing is, it'll force blizz to again have to post comparison values and then people will find some other mobs in dungeons to manipulate to repeat this all over again

The mother of a streamer took her time aswell. Took her 50 days.
---
The world record is 4 days and 20 hours.
---
But the leveling is so much fun. Don't rush it just take your time to explore the zones, test out some alts, get diffrent proffeccions, do some PvP etc. There is so much stuff to do rushing to max level as a new player is a waste of everything wow has to offer.
---
12 days is nothing while having fun.
---
Will look when I get home.
---
Oh yeah forgot mouse buttons. 
---
As for OP: What exactly are you asking then? You WILL memorize everything eventually, that's a non-issue. If you feel you can perform well enough while clicking, go and do that. We had a warlock clicker on our Tribute to Insanity kill, you'll find people who click something in all areas of WoW.
---
tbf, r/wow has been in disarray ever since 7.3.5 made leveling less of a joke and never recovered from it.    
---
That being said, I am increasingly inclined to believe that Classic may actually kill retail. The initial hype certainly seems big enough and with bfa being in such a poor state (even for retails rather low standards nowadays) many could decide to never look bad.
---
I‚Äôm sorry for enjoying one of my favorite games that I‚Äôve been playing for the past 11/12 years, how dare I
---
It was possible. Many people will tell you about the times someone kited Lord Kazzak into Stormwind.
---
So play a druid and do whatever role you want to
---
Up - Interupt,  Down - Dispell/Purge etc. It just make sence thinking about it.
---
&gt; Even on the Blizzcon 2005 WoW raid design they said that there was no point in making a lvl 40, 50 or lower raid, since people outlevel it and its relevance its lost, same thing happened when BC came out, people stopped doing Vanilla raids since there was no point, and it happened again with WotLK 
---
One of the main reasons why Blizzard should never consider a re-release of TBC, and instead focus on 1.13. There are plenty more reasons, but Classic MUST be a permanent and relevant world regardless of the content.
---
TBC will make all Classic content IRRELEVANT, and nobody wants that.
---
The ONLY reason why there is (albeit much weaker than a year ago) a request for TBC is that people are (subjectively) afraid that Blizzard will fuck it up somehow.
---
A year ago, over 80% of the players wanted TBC after Classic, and 20% wanted 1.13. Now, it's about 60-40 split. 6 months into Classic, and this will be 20-80 in favor of 1.13.
---
Content MUST stay relevant, no level cap increase, no gear catch-up, no messing around talents, skills, professions, etc.
---
Just NEW content tunned for lvl 60.
---
Heh, even if they do this it wouldnt work in WoW...
---
Classes at lower levels are so fundamentally broken and in most cases way more powerful..
---
Try to use some common sense...
---
if you encounter a scenario of 3 people dying from food poisoning having ordered the same and the restaurant itself says there isnt anything wrong with the food would you blindly believe it and start eating the same ?...
---
Blizzard needs to be fact checked otherwise they could easily tell you that the critters known as rats cause Curse of doom to be placed on players when you kill them...
---
Yeah, that's because leeway doesn't exist on pservers.
---
New meta on level 30 cap, excitement for new official classic, nostalgia, general hate train on BFA. Also not 15 years of content, but 1 patch worth of content, unless you mean a surplus of possible transmog runs. Stop being negative nancies about retail and play what you like.
---
AP gives you 1 DPS for every 14 AP. Melee dmg = physical dmg, I feel like you're asking the wrong questions here.
---
But it was main hand? Are you sure you wielded 2 of them?

This sub was full of posts like this until Blizzard confirmed the numbers are correct. You're just wrong.
---
Always troll.
---
You're retarded. It's a video game idiot, I'll save gold over "pixel honor" any day of the week
---
If you've never played at minimum it will take you 12 days / played.
---
Warlock tank. It's not viable everywhere (especially against fire resistant bosses) but it will become better later on with pvp gear. How does 13k health pool and at least 50% physical damage mitigation sound for cloth wearer? I'll roll one and start as dps but will eventually gear towards tanking
---
Yeah that does make a Little more sense for those games.
---
I games like WoW it would not be smart for the developers because the community would not be happy if the People that got to Play the beta - actually get a headstart for being invited to the beta too...
---
I HOTS and Hearthstone you can just buy to the same Level pretty much - since actual Player Levels don¬¥t matter as much. 
---
In WoW it's like almost the biggest Thing :P
---
I get why you would ask that though - I would be really mad if it was that way and I didn¬¥t get an invite!
---
I am actually thinking the opposite. Bugs make this game even more interesting (unless its some plain "you cant complete the quest bug")
---
That's my kinda lady. Although I would advise her to smoke with her left hand gotta keep the mouse  hand free
---
All combat items bound, so spells, macros, consumes and eng items.
---
If it wasn‚Äôt used in PVP combat I just clicked - hearthstone, ritual of summoning, find minerals etc. etc.
---
The least wanted healer is a druid? On top of the fact that your English makes no sense by saying a " wanted healer", your logic also fails badly. I wonder why everyone thinks they have been a raid leader for 10 years and understand the mechanics of the game better than anyone. Druids hands down are the most wanted healer in any raid obviously. Bring able to cr and heal while moving gives them the edge.
---
That‚Äôs a good point. However, in my situation it was incredibly stressful because of the difficulty in keeping up with the party and the general instance on speed often resulted in a wipe. Of course, the usual response was ‚Äúnoob healer‚Äù and while I don‚Äôt profess to be the best, I clearly asked for a mb a couple times before the wipe. 
---
Anyways, obviously it was my choice to play a healer and perhaps I could have improved my skill, but just the general ‚Äúrush through everything at max speed and to hell with story, party members, etc.‚Äù is just hella fatiguing. 
---
While I am certain that there will be similar people in Classic WoW, I think it will be significantly less because as you mentioned, it is not possible to just blaze through it. 
---
I appreciate teamwork, good crowd control, communication, comradeship and appreciation for the content itself (and not just for mythic raids). Hoping to find a guild that shares that view :)
---
Lol, here comes the tears boys!!!
---
Like playing a game to have fun.
---
Jokes aside, best of luck I'm sure you will have a blast the first couple of weeks!
---
The whole reason of these stresstests is to test the new layering technique. But I really hope they are able to fix it in time.
---
ISFP-T, Mage, PvP
---
Because it gave you a reason to play, it gave you a reason to do more than you have to, to go the extra mile, and I thought that was nice.
---
Yes some legendaries were too strong and that was a problem, but I think if they were just good stats with small QoL effects ( like the Demonic portal having no CD for warlock, or the multi class ones who gave move speed or healing when standing still)
---
Of course it is in progress, what did you think the beta was for?^^
---
Just stay hooked up to a dialysis machine and it'll be all gooood
---
That does sound waaay off.. I was horrible in vanilla playing a hunter and in pretty much tier 0 (did a tooon of dungeons back then) and dungeon blues I could go into those silithid hives in silithus filled with 60-62 elites and as long as I used freeze trap and my pet properly I could clear them out/farm the area for chests. Those elites where A LOT toughter than a single level 60 mob :P
---
The numbers are correct. We already know privates have been wrong this whole time and some private server owners have gone on record as saying they purposefully made everything harder.
---
The game is not as hard as you remember it being, you were just young and bad with poor hardware.
---
High level zones unless, you are a carebear, are highly contested and doesn't guarantee the farm.  I know plenty of people since WoD, that just forfeit professions.   No where is it a must to get cata and MOP for professions, even if you just started the profession.  IF you wanted any profession, you have to return to the proper level (classic).  Doesn't help that a lot of professions are disabled in PvP, or add just jack shit to the table.     Luckily classic decides what is favored, and is not catered. BC was the start of the shit show, can't change my mind otherwise.
---
For a while, you could also spec Demonic Sacrifice, Sacrifice your succubus for a huge damage buff, and use Goblin Jumper Cables ore a quick priest friend to resurrect the succubus corpse, allowing you to apply Soul Link for the damage split and additional Damage boost. Then pop the Black Book trinket yo boost the Succy, and you were elevated to unstoppable killing machine.
---
As I recall, this particular quirk was left in the game for quite some time.
---
They didn't get me.
---
Yeah exactly. I have got the wow atlas book ready (as I like knowing where I am going, much like RL lol) and I like having an idea as to where to find a nice upgrade on my sword or mace (playing rogue), but other than that I am going in to just have fun and immerse myself.
---
I see what you mean. And I agree, play for fun. But do not forget that people do not always want to carry dead weights, especially in raids.
---
Not saying nelf priest is that, but if a guild has an option to choose from a dwarf or nelf priest, more likely than not a guild will go for a dwarf.
---
Im all for having fun, but not at the cost of other peoples enjoyment of a game (unless its pvp)
---
This is sharding, not layering, sharding is in.  Read the blue post.
---
It's been noticed and doesn't matter. 
---
Blizzard doesn't want people in queues and they don't want to merge small populated servers 1 month in... so we have layering. 
---
We have to deal with it.
---
Dwarf Priests are the only Race of priests that get fear ward. 
---
That doesn¬¥t matter too much while leveling tbh but... what is there to hate about a dwarf priest? :D
---
I think the fearward is the only Major difference that sets dwarfs apart from other priests.
---
Bullshit I had closed beta access and I didn't lose anything after going in to open beta on Hearthstone
---
If you are only "playing a bit on the weekend" you won't be touching 40 man raids I think and for normal 5man your gear works fine. As long as you have a shield, one hander and defensive stance you are good. Don't try to tank with a 2h weapon! .:)
---
And it wasn‚Äôt even that busy in the zone, maybe only 100 people. Imagine what it will be like with 3000 people in 6 starter zones on launch day and another 3000 inqueue.
---
i found that the best raid leaders are ranged, they can stay back and observe everything going on. if they are a druid healer then they can just ignore 99% of the fight just hotting 5 targets on repeat
---
Feel free to fill your raid with healing druids. I'm talking for my experience.
---
It sounds like its just RNG that determines if u can have high or low attendance. I think any dps class will be fine for that as guilds will have more dps in their roster.
---
Dont get me wrong please, if warrior is THE CLASS  u wanna play you should do it,but please consider there are 39 other people in your raid as i mentioned in my other Comment.
---
Ranged attack power is separate if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre getting at
---
Watched the entire thing, can't remember the last time I was so entertained from World of Warcraft content.
---
Problem with Wotlk was though that the content made up for the bad design decision which at back then we didn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt see. LFG, gearing, trivialisation of raids after new one releases.
---
this was my zone post barrens, then southern barrens and it forked from there depending on my feelings
---
20 hours a week is far from casual. And yes its definitely enough time. Just dont forget to have fun!
---
If it says "Attack Power" then it's both melee and ranged.
---
If it says "Ranged Attack Power" or "Melee Attack Power" then it's just the one.
---
Strength gives Melee Attack Power
---
Agility gives Ranged Attack Power for Hunters, Warriors, &amp; Rogues
---
Agility gives Melee Attack Power for Rogues, Hunters, &amp; Druids (in cat form)
---
To reiterate, it‚Äôs very difficult to accidentally get on the wrong language server. They‚Äôre in different realmlist tabs, sorted entirely by language. So when I used to log in, it would be to English-EU servers, I‚Äôd never even see the German and French lists, but they were accessible if I wanted.
---
Having played on a lot of EU servers, sure you‚Äôll have some international guilds, but it‚Äôs quite accepted that English is the language of the game on English servers, and you won‚Äôt be stuck in some nightmare of a Russian trade chat half the time.
---
aww thats sad, hope they change that till release.
---
Mobs literally never backpedalled in vanilla. They always ran forward. Even to run back/run away they always turned and ran forward.
---
Its not allways about the endgame üòÄ
---
Did you see that twitch clip?  It doesn't look very fun to have mobs and players vanish and materialize all the time, this isn't exactly true to classic.
---
I remember farming grave moss when I was levelling in vanilla and making money off it. All I can see that it‚Äôs used for is shadow protection potions - were there many bosses using shadow damage? I have vague recollections of mass shadowbolts in bwl perhaps?
---
Shame ele quit wow ages ago.
---
Who are you speaking for? Classic looks fantastic for sure but Im having tons of fun in BFA as well and cannot wait for 8.2, warmode, hunting down mounts, arenas and trying to progress in Raids.   
---
If I was given Beta? Sure Id be logging in a heartbeat but I do love both. These kind of threads are so unnecessarily toxic
---
Haha I was about to say "casual 3 hours a day :P"
---
That is a day for me when I literally spend all my free time on the PC - and even then I probably wouldn¬¥t make 20hrs xD
---
AP (on its own) increases physical damage. Of course this includes melee damage other than magical stuff attached to it (paladin seals, many other procs, elemental damage of certain weapons) but also non-magical ranged attacks (mostly relevant for hunters, but warrior/rogue ranged shots are also affected). 
---
On the other side items or effects stating melee AP or ranged AP will only affect the stated part. As such something common in later patches like giving BoMight to a hunter (+AP later on, + MELEE AP in vanilla) becomes quite useless (but hey, don't be a dick and give it to his pet ;), the hunter will be happy wil a BoWisdom) or certain items giving only one of them (Ashjre'thul is a hunter-only because of this, as it gives only ranged AP).
---
If you have evidence pls update!
---
It's probably closer to level 39 meta because the access to game changing level 30 spells as well as 21 point talents completely changes the meta.
---
Rolling gnome mage
---
I have a whole different view on this, which I find interesting because I also agree with yours.
---
I find classic way more accessible than BFA. To a new player, BFA quickly makes you feel you're not really playing the game unless you're at lvl 120 running some weird instances where your every mistake gets noticed and punished. Sure the first few levels where interesting, but then you realize how doubting the task is to reach 120, at which point you'll be overwhelmed by pretty much everything.
---
Then you have classic. As a total newbie, when you log on, the adventure starts then and there. You don't even realize there is a lvl cap and end game content, the game makes you feel you're already playing when you run to your next quest objectives. 
---
I think classic is the best entry point for total newbies. They get to play the game, and they can burn out of it before reaching 60 and STILL have actually experienced wow.
---
Doesn't bfa use the same client as legion?

This is mine as well. I see no reason why it can't just be a toggle. Now mob models as well. Some of them are so much better.

---
Venruki have seen the light, but Preach video was the one that I expected, because Preach is a bigger name, and every time he talked about Classic, he was skeptical, at best.
---
He is still a little bit in denial, arguing that he will still play BfA, albeit for raiding only...but that is after he played a limited, lvl 30 cap beta. 
---
Once he (and many , may others) will play Classic, he will ditch BfA, because, let's face it...it's a no brainer. At the end of this video, his words are what EVERYONE in the Classic camp was saying since the beginning of time (I mean 2005) : **"IT IS THE BETTER VIDEO GAME".**
---
Sadly I don't think they have a solution 100%, it's a evil that we have to deal with because they need "everyone to be able to play on launch day" and that sucks. 
---
Really wish they would treat layers like the mini servers they are and not let people go in between them without logging out and selecting it.
---
Its the same technique but with minor ajustments. Looks like its indeed not working as intended and they are working on it.
---
Really hope they are able to... its the biggest consern we have I would guess.
---
yeah nah, this isn't layering, it's sharding, ie- Blizzard saves money on hardware at the expense of your immersion and community.
---
True. Stormreaver was known as finreaver due to its heavy finnish population
---
It was either level 29 or 39, never 30. And you couldn't run dungeons as a twink in vanilla (at least not many) because you would level up. There was no XP disable.
---
I actually enjoy BfA, switching between alts doing quests, expeditions or just some dailies, achievement/pet battles to have a bit of variation.
---
Everyone knows what the meaning is. It‚Äôs just those guys that are very fun at parties pointing this out..
---
But it is useful for strath undead
---
That's what I liked about it actually üôÇ.
---
From what I remember as a fully decked out rogue in vanilla, even the elites at hearthglen or tyr's hand (which was a usual farmspot back then) would hit like trucks if they got a crit or crushing blow. It seems really weird to have a bunch of level 30's which what basically equals to shit gear at max level, hold their ground against level 40+ elite NPC's.
---
Yeah player skill and all that, but I can assure you that "high-end" BWL or AQ raiders at the time weren't all imbeciles either, generally people at that level knew what to do and the skill level difference compared to today isnt going to magically save you for taking crushing blows that eat a 3rd of your hp away. 
---
Seems fishy atleast, but obviously I could just be misremembering.
---
I had the same issues. Especially in Boralus
---
Unofficial surveys seem to indicate that people are planning on rolling about 52-48% H-A. So unless you're on a badly balanced server, it should be pretty even.
---
Of Course it is. Because it will be in classic and that is good.
---
We will have far more Players in classic (at least in the beginning) than we had in vanilla and we will have far less Servers, because 50+% of the People will stop playing after a few weeks anyways.
---
So we really NEED sharding / layering in the beginning.

I think you don't understand human nature. We didn't need a damn story for anything. We see a fucking portal, we WANT to go through it, because we are fucking humans.
---
We don't need a story to go to a portal...we just do it, because the portal is fucking there, and our brains cannot function without answers.
---
WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH THE PORTAL !
---
I've had that feeling ever since I came back in Wrath and explored the BC areas, finding all these vendors and a whole city that was just empty and outdated. It made me sad to have missed it, but also confused that it was unused. Felt like visiting an abandoned city.
---
People have different kind of taste for humor. It's often said that for humor to be at it's best someone is going to get hurt in one way or another. I found the clip hilarious, cause the reaction was so over the top on a subject that most people just casually brush off. Guess I am brain-dead then.
---
He's playing a character. He's said it himself and said if you want to have comparison to what he really is like, you should check out his IRL youtube channel. 
---
I feel like you're taking him way too seriously.
---
20 hours a week ? Casual ? WTF is wrong with you ? :D
---
I would say you are casual if you Play 1-10 hours a week max.
---
20 hours is mediocre.
---
It will take multiple weeks / months so reach 60 if you dont rush 24/7.
---
I like this approach to BiS lists
---
Cool, have u tried it on the beta?
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/NaiveCredulousGnatGrammarKing](https://clips.twitch.tv/NaiveCredulousGnatGrammarKing)
---
It‚Äôs not that big of an issue, fewer spells.
---
As someone who took the game very seriously during patch 7.2, being essentially crippled in terms of damage when competing with other players who played my class who happened to get lucky felt extremely unfair.
---
They just need to take all of this out. Layering, sharding, just get rid of it. 
---
It's been discussed to death, but people are still confused as to what the fuck is going on. People phasing in and out, mining nodes in other "layers", how long will layering stay for?
---
This is just dumb.
---
Not sure about raiding. For raiding you need two fixed evenings per week, during Progress pushing maybe even a thirds. Most People dont have that nowadays.
---
&gt; Yes some legendaries were too strong and that was a problem, but I think if they were just good stats with small QoL effects ( like the Demonic portal having no CD for warlock, or the multi class ones who gave move speed or healing when standing still)
---
So does AP increase trinkets that cause physical damage then?
---
&gt;gives Ranged Attack Power for Hunters, Warrio
---
 So does AP increase trinkets that cause physical damage then?
---
Yes, because of those. They‚Äôre both really strong in pvp. Do not underestimate.
---
Humans have no pvp racial. Weapon skill doesn‚Äôt matter because everyone gets scaled to max weaponskill for their level in BG PVP.
---
Who and who?
---
That moment... when you wanna tank as a shaman.
---
Just wondering if AP increases trinkets that cause physical damage.
---
Nice to see all these people preparing and everything. Me, I'm just going to wait until it comes out and then I'll see. All I prepared is my class, race and name.
---
I stopped raiding in retail in WoD... I've had very little interest in wow since but I'm watching this and can't wait to experience the game I fell in love with years ago. 
---
BRD has so many great memories as a total noob exploring a seemingly endless dungeon. The people I met tanking there formed a guild which went from a leveling guild to one of the best raiding guilds on the server from classic till it died in WoD.
---
Funny to see this guy is still so bad at this game after playing it for thousands of hours.
---
Been playing Minecraft. That is all.
---
Just watch both
---
Highlord Bolvar rather than Wyrnn? (I‚Äôm Horde!)
---
Regardless of names it‚Äôs the faction leaders and whether they are performing as intended or have accidentally been included as part of the scenery who are the concern
---
No I don't know.
---
Retarded clickbait title
---
The return of classic WoW will see almost all of the long term private server players join and also those who played vanilla. Of course there will be a spike of random gamers and retail players, but to think the amount is 'underestimated' would be wrong imo. Blizzard isnt stupid enough to assume month 1 numbers will hold. They'll drop but hold at the private/vanilla player level. Thats my opinion anyway.
---
nothing wrong with buying ammo and maintaining pet happiness , its something i miss from the new hunters.. i rather play the old one i have in 2005
---
Oh I didn't know that about int. So no basic stat increases spell power? Only gear that specifically has spell power increase?
---
Layering is supposed to work this way. Every time you log in you get assigned to one layer and you are not moved to another one until you log out.
---
And the plan is to remove layering entirely after the initial weeks of launch.
---
100% agree
---
Before the beta I wouldn‚Äôt have minded, but seeing how big the culture of streaming every possible pve encounter is, I think even a lvl 50 meta could steal some thunder from release and see people trying to run 60 dungeons.
---
Does anyone know when the next Embrace is? Could make a really cool event in a future expansion.
---
No. Not unless it says so on the trinket.
---
&gt;Bonepaw Hyena:
---
Listed with a damage of 14-19. Note that Hecklefang Hyenas, which are levels 15-16 do 21-22 damage. Accordingly, the Hyenas in Desolace have unusually low auto attack damage, but the values are correct.
---
I believe this is because they roam in packs of up to 5 mobs in certain areas, so the damage is probably scaled down to account for that.
---
Layer per world, not continent.
---
Shift+scroll up is always movement speed increase ability such as sprint or aspect of the cheetah. 
---
Shift+scroll down is usually a defensive ability such as evasion or aspect of the monkey.  
---
I think my keybinds make more sense but everyone‚Äôs will vary.
---
They should just do separate servers with no interaction between them. I'd personally love to have TBC (and maybe WotLK) servers, but you need all of them to be completely separate and self contained. There were a lot of amazing things about TBC back in the day too, for one I think the PvP was at its most interesting.
---
Perhaps one or two could be 'progression' servers, like diablo seasons where every  few months they create a new server and add additional expansion packs to it over time, and then let you transfer to the existing 'main' server and reset it again at the end of its lifecycle.
---
They were actually excellent dungeons all things considered.
---
A massive shame they decided to get rid of the fantastic original versions
---
I don't know if any invites have gone out for stress since the testing. Beta invites seem to have stopped altogether outside of selective invites.
---
FUCK LAYERING!! I'd rather wait in a queue AND be merged later!
---
I think the max level concept is part of the problem. In MUDs, max level tends to be a perk or something the PvE crowd chase and often the games can be played at any level. Some MUDs even have flexible level systems, where a day of PvP might see you drop 10 levels, but an hour or two of bashing has you back where you started.
---
Part of this is because skills often have multiple ways to obtain them, with leveling only being one route, and the skill uses dictates power much more than level or gear. You see people of all levels and strengths participating because everyone can contribute - the level 20 guy will drop quick if he's attacked because his health pool is tiny, but he can still use a noobie skill to keep someone entangled while the level 100s wail on them. 
---
There is so much emphasis on levels in modern MMOs to the point where the game is only considered to start at max level and I think it's created an unhealthy mindset towards progression. It's much more engaging to be able to be part of the action just hours after rolling a character and it means new players aren't sequestered off doing other stuff until they catch up.
---
You can't have a few thousand people questing on the same spot; that isn't fun for the players, the servers and your PC. I am glad that they are working on a solution and testing it. If such things get reported now, they might be fixed or less common at launch.
---
People complaining all the time just take the time Blizzard could use for bug hunt away and annoy everyone.
---
A lot of people won‚Äôt be in that boat, not everyone wants to feel close to streamers and measures their enjoyment on social proximity to particular players.
---
Turned up to mc in full fr gear
---
Transmog &amp; Mounts? We all know fashion is the true endgame.
---
You should probably point out osrs was a failure and was dying until they started adding new content and changes. 
---
With all the #nochanges people here I wonder how that would be received
---
Sure but it was legit something that was in the game and isnt' in the beta. They don't care cause it doesn't affect their pvp or whatever, I think that's a dumb way to go about a beta test.
---
Esfand is a cool guy imo, and mcconnell doesn't talk much other than to call asmon an idiot which can be funny
---
You are too hung up on this 1-60 level, leveling pace being important mentality. Its not important at all. The main game had the most amount of zones, and they scaled the amount of levels to the zones given (probably a little more complicated than this, but still), and they wanted you to discover the world as much you can, while also reaching lvl 60 in a reasonable time.  
---
But at the end of the day its just numbers/time, and it could have been slower/more levels, or faster/less levels, if the quests, xp, amount of zones, sizes were different. But since it would have been the original game you played and loved, you would feel it was just as important. 
---
Yes every expannsion changes the dynamics, because ofc they want you to do and discover the new stuff, and the previous ones and the original game is just not the main event anymore, thats just how it is, whether you like it or not. But none of them is superioir, not even classic WoW.
---
There are many ways they could make old content relevant again, but sticking to this "1-60 supposed to be the main leveling experience", its just nonsensical.
---
Remember when they announced it was the summer of 2019 but really meant the beginning of fall &gt;.&gt;
---
Movement is Cntr+W, autowalk is alt+W
---
ClaSsIc SUmMeR
---
Agreed. Plus they already posted that there won‚Äôt  be anymore mass invites (except stress tests). Only a few small ways due to having the capacity they need.
---
No, Blizzard is clearly NOT underestimating it. They already know it will be at least three times bigger than BFA, at launch. This is why they came up with layering. This is why they did the stress test.
---
There is SO MUCH money in Classic, and they KNOW it.
---
Sure, a month after launch, lots of people will quit, but Classic will still be twice as big as BfA.
---
Blizzard KNOWS that, and they are preparing for it since 2016, after the petition, after meeting Kern and after meeting Nostalrius team.
---
Blizzard KNOWS that Classic will be absolutely HUGE, and they are totally preparing for that.
---
I guess it's also nice to prepare what realms you and your friends are going to play on
---
Ok but that makes no sense if you think about it, at all.
---
So say you have 3 layers. 1 and 2 are 100% full, so you get placed in layer 3, but there are only like 5 people in layer 3. Do you stay there and play with 5 other people? What if enough people log out from layer 2? Then you would get phased into that layer from layer 3 right?
---
How will you ever balance layers if you say people can't move between the layers? You're gonna be stuck with some dead layers then. So this is working as intended?
---
Leveling 1-60 will take you few month if you are not a hardcore player. You will be getting your spells one by one, so just bind all your keybinds even empty bars and jsut sistematically add spells according to your preference. Before you get level 60 you will get use to everything. I usually struggle at when i boost/lvl fast, but back in the day when it actually took longer it was no problem. I played on TBC like a year ago with Lock which had even more spells than in vanilla. In time i even started to hide most of my spells that does not have CD cause i didn't need to see the icon or the bind.
---
This was my UI on sl/sl lock for pvp. The rest of the spells were not visible, but i had them bind. I just didn't need to see them. https://imgur.com/C7daB8G

---
so it is 2.0 when yes, a shitload from vanilla has been nerfed. that explains also why the mobs do less damage everywhere. they nerfed them so leveling would be easier for the new comers that had to start from scratch.
---
the "not seen in a long time" tag was added later since thottbot was up until wrath when it was bought and integrated into wowhead
---
This is a great point, I cant wait to be just a peasent with a stick going aroudn smacking wolves and dying hehe
---
Ugh, logging out 4 times to check devilsaur or black lotus spawns
---
What it boils down to, at least for me, is as others have said the community feel/world feel is amazing.
---
Funnily enough I probably raided more in MoP than vanilla. 
---
Levelling is as much of the game as the end content in classic.
---
You have world pvp occurring spontaneously and frequently after you hit the neutral zones. 
---
The raids felt truly epic back then - whilst they may now appear dated and comparatively easy compared to heroic raids in MoP. The challenge came mainly from getting 40 competent people together in the first place.
---
No LFR/group finder/flying mounts means you have to interact. Make friends. Get shat on by this guy‚Äôs friend who is 20 levels above you. Put out a request to any high level that‚Äôs bored to come stomp him. 
---
A lot of it will be far more enjoyable for us with our rose tinted goggles. Why the hell would you want to waste time on a slobberknocker next to nessingwary‚Äôs camp when you‚Äôve got quests to grind so you can hit 60 faster and prepare for raids?! Well... I do. It‚Äôll take me ages to level up. I‚Äôm going to enjoy it.
---
I‚Äôd say yes, if they run low on people playing or increase the numbers for a future wave if you have a day 1 account you have a good shot.  I don‚Äôt know anyone with a day 1 account that opted in and didn‚Äôt get beta.
---
Ok, can you find a source or you know from experience?
---
I don't know how Blizz thought how people get assigned to them when logging in, but the plan is to not move players between layers while they are playing.
---
You want to have 1000+ people fighting over wolfs the first day, destroying all fun, many PCs and maybe even the servers?
---
Fuck those harpies
---
He's definitely not level 34 if he has reckoning.

Level 24 Warrior in 2006, getting hit for around 18:
---
I've done the same fact checking for other bosses and mobs, there is no disparity in the damage values between Classic and 2006 Vanilla WoW.
---
The real 200 IQ play: Find someone who shares your love of video games.
---
As far as I'm aware they were testing layering during the stress test. So there's wasn't only 100 people. You only saw 100 people.
---
I have no idea what trinket you're talking about. Physical dmg doesn't scale. Just do a quick google search
---
&gt; BfA is something that has been out for awhile. Classic is a game that technically is not even out yet
---
Vanilla WoW has existed via private servers throughout the duration of all other expansion. Granted its not a perfect replica, but despite this, the demand for the original game has constantly been increasing over time and people have continued to play vanilla, throughout the whole duration (kinda crazy when you think about it). People's statements are not baseless and have backing based on an imperfect replica.
---
But that cannot be possible, people must realize this? If you have 5000 people online at 8pm, and 2000 online at 11:30 pm, then unless you move people from layers it's gonna suck so bad?
---
I really liked that video. I forgot that there was no timers in BG"s. hell yeah.
---
It is, indeed, too bad Silverpine is the worst zone.
---
Yes it is kid.
---
Yes, this is 1000% true.
---
This is a bit of a fallacy.
---
You say before sharing you'd see that many just from your own server, but on live you don't see that many in your own server because they are shared away. 
---
That doesn't mean they aren't there. It doesn't prioritise same server players. 
---
And I don't understand why a guy pointing out that some people might actually enjoy retail can get down voted unless this is literally just a circle jerk. 
---
On top of that, if you for example only enjoy raiding then you'd far prefer live to vanilla.
---
Only spent gold on mine.
---
Yea. That's how MMO launches work, that's part of the fun.
---
I'd still say mage tbh. The class is surprisingly easy.
---
What I meant was that this specific kind of bugs that plagues Classic is the leftover of "quality of life" style of retail caused by whiny players over years. Simply put, bugs that are found on Classic generally are:
---
- something should happen, but it doesn't
---
- this mob should do something, but it doesn't
---
- interaction X should be possible, but it isn't 
---
It's always less, never more. It's never "unintended behaviour", its a lack of behaviour.
---
I really enjoyed the wailing caverns quest chain from cross roads, discovering the oasis‚Äôs and leading you into the dungeon.
---
I think a lot of people inadvertantly  mildly twinked - I know I did. You didn't get xp from battlegrounds in vanilla, so whenever we reached an important new skill/talent tier, we'd make sure our gear was good, I'd enchant stuff, etc, then we'd sit in BGs for a few days.
---
Replace layers with servers, that is their intention. Instead of having a bunch of servers get pushed together a month after launch,  they can  have layers for launch and then remove them when it does down a little and people are spread out a little more.
---
Ferals don't use weapons though. It's just a stat stick.
---
Originally the 20s fought in the lower brackets, 30s in the lower bracket, 40s in the lower bracket, etc.
---
There was no xp disable, that is correct.
---
 Downvoted for title, didn‚Äôt watch the video
---
&gt;R13 is definitely Elemental gear
---
haha, nice one. 
---
&gt;Mail "of Nature's Wrath" greens
---
This one is even better, not sure if you even realize that shaman with the gear you proposed will be utter shit because you barely have any health or mana pool.
---
&gt; Pvp isnt as easy as naming 3 abilities and saying win.
---
You perfectly described why I stopped discussing pvp
---
That clip is a bug. People have reported the same thing, this isn't how it's supposed to be working.
---
**hence the beta**
---
WoW has shit to learn from ESO
---
To each their own!
---
That place was a whole fucking world.
---
Interesting, I mean if Classic just destroys  retail in numbers they would be stupid not to change up retail to incorporate features and similarities to Classic.
---
Its win win :)
---
I don't know about you, but anticipating and planing it, just to then not be able to play for a few days until a hotfix (e.g. layers or shards) comes out isn't that fun for me...
---
And if it is either split players or make the game cradh, I'd rather have them test it out properly a few months before the launch.
---
I think that‚Äôs part of what made vanilla so special. You made up a lot of your fun, versus playing on rails.
---
Did you watch the Chris Wilson POE talk at GDC? Man I would love him to be the lead developer for WoW, the understanding he has of what keeps a game fresh and fun is on a totally other level to what Blizzard have shown themselves capable of over the last 10 years. You really start to understand how they took things in totally the wrong direction once you start to think along the lines of fundamental underlying design choices.
---
Empty layers don‚Äôt exist. Layers are created and removed as needed. It‚Äôs not like sharding where there are empty shards.
---
Starting completely new in BFA must be super offputting, 'Im lvl 1 what do I do, nobody around, hrmm, oh wait the game starts officially at lvl 120?!?!?'
---
I mean they clearly looked carefully at who they could invite, they were never gonna invite people who stopped for months and came back for it imo... It makes sense, no doubt about that, cause people hate BfA, but they'd rather have people who stuck with the game for better or worse
---
Unfortunately you can't make mooncloth in it ...
---
If you hate the guy just don't click on the link and get on with your day.
---
Yeah...No, no it‚Äôs not.
---
~10 days /played to level 60 assuming your focus is levelling and you're reasonably efficient at doing it.
---
10 days = 240 hours. 20 hours a week means 240/20 = 12 weeks.
---
Nvm you can just check on wowhead they added the values there:  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20924/consecration  (SP mod: 0.042)
---
I did and I got it, should buy some lottery tickets ^^
---
People have already reported it plenty. It's a beta. There's things that are leftover in the client that shouldn't be there, this is one of them. The *entire reason* they're using layering is to avoid this stuff, why would they bother creating a new system if they were just going to use the old one anyway..?
---
poICE
---
(No shout out to Piggah?!)
---
Of course I fucked up the title because of auto-complete.
---
Yeah apparently theres a command script you can punch in to do it.
---
Right, so we agree you can be phased into another layer in the middle of playing as shown in the video? And that you need to do this for layering to ever work?
---
You're getting downvoted but I think your point is quite reasonable - I'm also going to wait to find out which servers are the ones without massive streamer concentration. That being said, we do need streamers if we want the Classic release to be really succesful and "sustainable", more so if we want to see TBC content in the upcoming years!
---
I agree, they fundemantally disrespected our most important choices and commitments, making the whole experience feel disposable, i.e. trashy. And the killer for me was that it was my time, my enthusiasm, my ideas, my objectives, my accomplishments, are the trash they've kept on throwing out!

---
The obvious answer is that they fill up the layers equally rather than filling one and moving on.
---
I want to say 2013 maybe?  It was during the MoP era which is when retail WoW officially became a game I no longer had interest in playing.
---
Idd. Streaming is both the best and worst thing that has happened to games.
---
Have you been around for the last few expansion releases? They've been basically perfect. Clock ticks over and suddenly your xp bar comes back and new zones are available.
---
Minus the other half of the server...
---
It destroyed retail wow for me entirely, how the fuck is this a good idea..
---
We will see, if the sub numbers explode in august
---
If beta is anything to go by then dungeons are like a pillow fight anyway, shaman tanks will be meta.
---
New content requires people to be able to catch up, i.e. if you start later you don't want to play 3 years before you can do that Lich guy that just got released. 
---
That will then get us to some problems that retail has right now.
---
Even some people on retail click and turn with their keyboards to this day.
---
No youre just retarded
---
Again you failed. Did I say let's invite all the druids? You have no experience to talk about it.
---
wtf... How tf is that a thing?!
---
u realize that this is still the case with layering, right?
---
great answer!
---
Depends on your view, personally I don't recognize former expansions as content in the latest expansion, it's not relevant. 
---
I think what most people mean is that rather than expansions operating as expansions they operate as 4 patch cycles instead. For instance in Vanilla, TBC, and to a lesser degree WotLK, all content from the beginning of the expansion was relevant until the end of the expansion. At the same time someone was progressing in Molten Core someone else was progressing in AQ40, someone else was leveling, etc. This is not the case in the expansions since then.
---
Each time a patch comes out all content prior to that is effectively rendered obsolete through catch up mechanics and loot showering mechanics. If BFA were Vanilla and leveled now you would have never gone through the dungeons, never went through ZG or Molten Core, and so on. You'd instantly be put into BWL and the same would apply to AQ40 and 8.2. The expansion is irrelevant, only the patch number matters.
---
I do agree though that there is a lot of bloat from previous expansions, honestly they just need to kill Azeroth and come out with WoW 2 or something at this point with a clean slate.
---
Same here, I burned out on BFA within maybe 3 days of dinging 120. Finding likeminded players is really hard and the game doesn't really support how we want to play, bottom line.

Thanks! Cheers, M.
---
is it gnomish or goblin ?
---
Becaise wow classic is something new. Ironic huh ?
---
I would love to see Shamans get the class review they never received. Without going into too much of the sordid details: Every other class got various QOL improvements to their spells and talents, but when Shamans were up, there was a lot of issues with a CM being out for medical reasons, the devs never got player feedback, they put in some really minimal bullshit, and as a result, in 1.12 Shamans are probably the worst off.
---
When some real drama went down, they admitted that the review had been half-assed, but they weren't going to do anything about it because BC was right around the corner and they had lots of changes planned for that. Well, now BC is NOT around the corner. BC will never be around the corner and the Shaman class will now be immortalized as substandard.
---
I think it would be awesome if the devs retroactively fixed the class they way they would have, had things gone right with the review. Not the BC changes, but the real tweaks that were needed back in Vanilla.
---
I know a lot of people don't give a shit, or think it would break their Classic bubble, but I believe it's needed. Not only from a technical gameplay standpoint but also as a way for Blizzard to make up for a mistake that alienated a lot of people a long time ago.
---
This won't happen unfortunately. All content will be done to death by the time the unwashed masses get access. It doesn't seem like a big deal now, but 3 months is an awful long time and it will kill a lot of the hype. Nothing will be considered an accomplishment because everything was done a month ago by said streamer. Yeah, it's a 15 year old game, but a lot, if not the majority of people didn't even play during classic.
---
A very good question. I kinda hope they let us keep the previous characters so we do not get stuck at character creation screen again..
---
I wouldn't say "very favorable light". It moved feral tanks from "never" to "it can tank 5-mans and a trash pack here and there". Feral DPS is in the same spot even with MCP.
---
Yeah....but I think I'm the minority in general, as I actually like leveling up with out the BoA gear and just going to what ever area seems fun at the time. With WoW right now, I don't mind it all that much. Like I made a monk and I'm leveling from 20 on in strangle thorn vale. It takes  a bit of time and I'm actually crafting my armor and all that. Then again I'm atoned as fuck and I just get immersed in the world and fuck off for hours.
---
Lolz, my guild was still wiping occasionally in Kara at the start of Wrath, maybe even at the start of 3.2. And Sunwell was a big nono x)
---
Wotlk still had slow stealth. I think it was Cata
---
What trinkets cause physical damage?
---
Do i have to be subbed to get beta ?
---
Yea, I know what you mean but still that's a decision made with only spreadsheet. The guild must be full of very skilled players if their final decision comes to that if nothing else differentiate players from each other anymore. You might leave out someone very amazing who might save the run with one or two skillful play and I'm not sure if fearward weights more than that. There will always be some dwarves anyways and I don't think you need so many of them regardless for a raid. I just hope there won't be generalization in classic that decides who is worthy and who isn't without looking into one's skills
---
Yeah you hit the nail on the head. There will be people that want to speed run classic, but I also feel that classic generally supports our play style better.
---
That sounds absolutely terrible for the people who are moved. The likelihood of being booted from an area you already cleared to an area suddenly full of mobs is a quick way to an unfair death.
---
Yer this need to be restricted. Really ruining a lot of the immersion. I dislike this a lot.
---
Can‚Äôt have name change to preserve realm rep. And no faction change on pvp realms. I‚Äôm happy with realm transfers so people can play with their friends.
---
You don't get it...live CANNOT be saved. Simply because Classic game design philosophy implies a HUGE numbers of changes for live, starting with the removal of LFR, LFD, flying mounts, change of gear drop rates, gear power, FULL rehash of skills, removal of transmog, etc., etc.
---
It's just SO MANY changes, because you cannot simply select a handful of Classic features and apply them to live. The result will be devastating.
---
Live MUST remain for brain-dead monkeys, who want instant gratification, feel like a god, have 500 mounts and pets, and doing useless t-mog runs...and it MUST remain as it is, because IT CANNOT BE CHANGED in a way that will NOT kill it.
---
Any Classic-like feature applied to live will kill live.Because live player base WANTS freebies.
---
Simple as that.
---
Make it a requirement to clear Naxx before being able to use the dark portal. üòé
---
Yeah i love The Forsaken zones so much, for me they are fun and atcually iconic. But it kinda stops there imo.
---
I will preface this by saying that I don‚Äôt watch him a lot. His charisma lies in his ability to make mundane things seem exciting,  and exciting things seem epic. He‚Äôll make a braveheart like speech ahead of big pulls to create a sense of urgency and context. He‚Äôs also able to entertain by creating his own content from aspects of the game that most streamers overlook in favor of scripted content. That‚Äôs what made him blow up and keep numbers up during content droughts. 
---
I remember watching him climb the biggest mountain on the broken shore on a demon hunter in the legion beta, making a big deal about how he‚Äôd be the first one to climb it. It was unironically one of the most exciting content I watched from legion.
---
Again, mathematically you can't do this and also keep layers alive. You don't know how many layers you need. Like if you say you have 3 layers and 1000 people online, that would mean 333 people per layer? That seems dumb. And it doesn't solve the problem that layers aim to solve, which is dealing with a dynamic population.
---
If there are a fixed amount of layers, and you fill them up equally, then why not just have seperate servers that you then merge? This is back to the server x1, server x2, server x3 solution.
---
It was a defining factor in vanilla. This is game CHANGING.
---
Name a trinket that causes physical damage?
---
Alright man, take care.
---
TRUE! I've actually been thinking about that. You have to add content, but one of the worst things is being OP when leveling, but you can't just get smashed by the new mobs that are one level above you after you've killed the toughest bosses in the world. It's fucking tough, but is fun to think about.
---
Well, better then waiting 10 minutes for someone to run all the way back.
---
I don't think anyone here even knows what an RP-PvP server is
---
That's called voicechat. Watch the stream of any of the other guys, and Asmon does the same to them. I'm sure you are a superhuman psychic who always know when multiple other people are engaging with their stream, but these guys are not.
---
I used to play on a private server where the level cap was 20. The admin scaled everything &gt;20 in the database down and divided most things by 3, so zones like Searing Gorge were level 15-18 rather than 45-55 and then endgame content got scaled back too, damage and health values reduced to suit.
---
It was actually surprisingly fun, despite the fact that you didn‚Äôt have many abilities and your talent tree was utterly terrible. It was quite a unique experience and kinda similar to what‚Äôs happening here with beta.
---
There is a addon for it too.
---
WoTLK was the pinnacle of smart class design though.  The only problem they had was that DPS and healing were so insanely over scaled so people were exploding left and right and they poured too many abilities in.
---
If you combined the style of vanilla, the dancing and healing pacing of TBC and the class balancing of Lich King you might have a near perfect WoW.
---
Its your last chance to go outside, its for your own good.
---
In both BFA and Legion, I leveled to cap in one week, I got geared in another. By the third week I had only world quests and not much else left besides transmog or mount farming. Raiding under mythic was a joke, I don't even think I ever did LFR.
---
It just felt the same to me, maybe Im unique in this but I somehow doubt it, I'm not that original.
---
I asked a dude why he hated BFA so much more than Legion, and he told me, sorta joking sorta serious, that it was because they made his wife Sylvanas the bad guy.
---
Not intended, they said that some time ago iirc, but reporting gives them more data to work with so we'll probably get news soon enough!
---
Whoa. I never knew this kind of thing existed. Really cool
---
TBC please.
---
I subbed for a Month and got my Beta after around a Week. Considering I spend nearly 4x more on the BlizzCon Demo, well worth it!
---
Those mmos are the best. Abd when devs acknowledge player action in actual game lore. Like major guild wars etc.
---
 #nochanges
---
/run SetCVar("nameplateMaxDistance", 40)

goes up to 100
---
You are right on those things, to not open it for anyone, but that was not my suggestion. Just don't do the name reserve thing at all, and you can invite those who worthy (that's completely up for Blizzard, like the streamers) for beta testing anyway. But since people are more than happy to pay money for a small chance to get in, I can't blame Blizzard on that.
---
And to make myslef clear: since when you had to be an active subsriber to a DIFFERENT game to get access to a BETA testing of another game, and then to have some name reservation (at least you can use half of that time for the real game)? Or is it really sounds absurd to me?
---
I like esfand too
---
WSG clips just make me sad, since they will not be present until phase 3 iirc.
---
RP servers are confirmed and people do that "weird shit" on any server. We want the real and true experience of vanilla :) RP pvp
---
&gt;ruining immersion
---
just reduce your distance or turn them off. stop trying to ruin stuff for other people.
---
WotLK was fun partly because so many people finally got to play Naxx after it had been quickly forgotten from the original vanilla release. That was genuine top tier vanilla content from the glory days which finally got to see the light of day.
---
Sounds to me like you're looking for the [Classic Cup Tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KhCOLB4A0U)
---
top tier comment, only came here to see where they were.
---
The devs said it at the streamer summit the week the beta launched, it's in a few of the videos they put out (but I don't feel like sitting through all of them again tbh). 
---
Where is that text from? It was only a couple of weeks ago they said "[early _months_](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=779)" when talking about layering.
---
yeah it is, lol the only non fun part is sitting in a 6 hour q to play the game.
---
wowlevelspeedcalculator.com
---
I think we've all been there
---
No, they specifically said continent
---
ESO doesnt gave gear reset and doesnt invalidate old content. It doesnt solve all the problem
---
This is necessary in order for layering to work though. Moving people between layers has to happen at some point for the solution to make sense mathematically.
---
In my times mages $$ for portals.  Nice mages only took tips :)
---
Humans are suggested for rogues because of their weapon skill talent which is only a factor for mobs higher than level 60.  Since players are capped at level 60, extra weapon skill is irrelevant.  Escape artist and Stone Form are both useful in PvP tho.
---
Yeah they did. And it shows.
---
Dont forget achievement and pet whoring
---
Leveling in classic is really great. 
---
Take enough time to do all the cool dungeons, they are super fun. Scarlet monastery, maraudon and many more :)
---
Take some time to do some open world pvp tarrens mill / southshore.
---
Enjoy the cool zones like stranglethorn or the barrens.

Hi, /u/kvargisgood
---
INTP-T Warrior reporting in!
---
Killing healers is not fair once you get some gear. I didn't play as SL much due to being a raider but as DS/ruin the matchup would go something like this:
---
Fear-&gt;dots-&gt;shadowbolt-&gt;pre-cast 2nd fear-&gt;shadowbolt-&gt;deathcoil-&gt;shadowburn.
---
Usually I'd kill them before they can even cast a global.
---
It would make sense this matchup is harder as SL tho since you give up a bit of damage for more tankiness. The biggest downside for DS/ruin is if you're caught without the appropriate pet you're as good as dead so it's a nice tradeoff.
---
It's cool that there's actual different builds with strengths and weaknesses.
---
Well he can restore it, so prob. faking
---
Yeah I remember that lol :D
---
It was possible in vanilla aswell with the command if not mistaken.
---
I doubt they invite more.
---
troll.
---
Tipsout? really?
---
Wow what a cool guy
---
Again, the 2.0.12 tag isn't when the mob was first seen ‚Äî it indicates that the page was last updated with kills for that patch. 
---
I don't know what you mean by the second paragraph. The page itself was from May 2007, before 2.3 was released (which had the 1-60 nerfs). Again, the mobs disappeared in 1.11.2 ‚Äî how do you explain no one ever recording any kills during 1.11.2 if you're sure they were nerfed in TBC?
---
reported for personal attacks, read the rules nerd
---
"Better buy a 110 boost so I can become overwhelmed by how little I know of the game and have nearly every group be incessently toxic to me so I can unsub."
---
The best solution would be to combine layers with queues. A new layer is only created when the queue reaches a certain threshold, preventing empty layers from being created while keeping queues on a very acceptable duration
---
Eh... it made leveling longer, not harder. It didn't make it less of a joke at all.
---
It's just a thought why that happened. I'm not sure how it exactly works, because I didn't test it nor did they give out those details yet. But I'm sure someone will figure it out.
---
Hi, /u/The-Bean-Wizard
---
Have you not actually read how it's planned to work..? By the time there's only 1000 people online at once, layering will be completely gone. We already know that each layer will hold as many as a single 2004 server did, so there won't realistically be more than 4 layers at launch. Assuming all goes to plan and the tourists drop off, they just need to remove (roughly) 1 layer a week until there's only 1. 
---
One of the main reasons layering is in is to avoid dead servers that have to be merged. No-one likes it. Suddenly your server is half-full of people you've never seen before.
---
Shame I am playing Alliance then :(
---
Hypothetically just make three servers that rotate this 60-70 season?
---
I‚Äôm always curious if people were forced to play the cata content to 60 and stay, if it‚Äôd be seen as an enjoyable variation. I recognize that the sharding content was tough but the dungeon remakes were interesting.
---
S1A: Vanilla (1.5 - 2 yr)
---
S1B: Cataclysm Base, keep Vanilla endgame but buff bosses for scaled talents (1.5 yr)
---
S2A: TBC (1 yr) -&gt; WotlK -&gt; (1 yr) -&gt; Cataclysm (1 yr)
---
S2B: WotlK -&gt; (1 yr) -&gt; Cataclysm (1 yr) -&gt; TBC (1 yr)
---
S2C: Cataclysm (1 yr) -&gt; TBC (1yr) -&gt; WotLK (1 yr)
---
That solves making empty layers (although with a queue, which i thought we were trying to avoid), but it doesn't solve the issue of a declining player count and how you will need to phase players from one layer to another at some point.
---
No I don't have access. But the point is what you described wouldn't teleport-reset the instance in vanilla. You can try the steps in beta and see if it works, and report it as bug because it worked in vanilla.
---
Heirlooms were nerfed considerably, dungeons were buffed, etc
---
Does anyone have any actual evidence that the script didn't work in Vanilla? You could also use a command to increase your zoom distance which only a few people bothered to do, that kinda gave them an advantage as well.
---
But the warlock/paladin mount has a mana cost, regular mounts doesn't.
---
12,64%
---
You're over thinking this. The best gold farms at launch wont be class specific. Also you gotta remember that some classes aren't as dependent of gold as others. If you just want a class that can mindlessly grind then a hunter or a mage would be the way to go.
---
They already did, they were called "the Horde". Who were definitely NOT stream sniping.
---
WoW had great raids
---
A MEGA LOL ZULOL
---
*Maximum*? God, you'd need to explore every inch of every level 60 zone while under 10. That'd be hell on earth.
---
Not sure what you are asking here but still...
---
1. Hunters are the fastest levelers and grinders, Aspect of the Cheetah is a huge movement boost at level 20. The race doesn't matter much though. NE have the highest base agility but that won't make much of a difference. The one thing that is a plus for NE though is that they don't have to run to Darkshore (arguably the best xp/hour zone in the 10-20 bracket) at level 12.
---
2. In theory yes but the problem with skinable beast is that they are often farther apart than e.g. humanoids, which are usually packed much more densely
---
3. Unless you need Lesser/greater magic wand (Priest, Mage, Warlock) you should not bother with professions if you want to be fast. Put cloth into First Aid is recommended (train while waiting for zepelin or boat)
---
4. Yes or you just grind mobs that drop grey items - which you simply vendor - and cash (DM:E Lashers come to mind)
---
5. They can open lockboxes, but you need the skill for it. For Rogues at level 60 they can make gold from pick pocketing mobs in e.g. BRD
---
6. Correct, also add leatherworking to the list. Enchanting is really expensive to level since you miss out on selling all those items, which will delay your level 40 mount unless you grind a lot (except lock and pally). Get to 60 quickly and then farm low level dungeons for greens to disenchant.
---
Don't you need to be subscribed for that though? I won't be subbing to reserve my name and I'm sure most other people will not sub to a game two weeks before they can play it to reserve a name. Everyone I know, including myself who are going to play wow, do not currently play retail so won't be resubbing for name reserve.
---
Pics or it didnt happen
---
I used to sinister strike with a dagger. It's only after I saw that my dps was below one of the ubiquitous legolases, that I tried to figure out the mechanics...
---
I don't have any proof
---
gnomish death ray
---
I was actually expecting that to be released at some point.
---
TF - Hunters
---
Sulfuras - Hunters
---
Atiesh - no one
---
Mounts - free roll
---
That‚Äòs what I thought too. But then again, if they want to simulate the launch of classic, they‚Äòd make everyone start fresh.

&lt;Dominatus&gt; \[OCEANIC\] \[HORDE\] \[PVP\]
---
Time Zone: GMT+10
---
Raid times: Starting from 10:00pm GMT+10 (# of days per week TBA)
---
Goals: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
Loot: EPGP or Council (Details TBA)
---
Contact: [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX)
---
Guild info: Dominatus is a late-night, semi-hardcore guild. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+10 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
Applicants: Anyone can apply, the levelling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).

Someone should actually submit a bug report in game for the npc‚Äôs not attacking the dragon if it hasn‚Äôt been done yet! They didn‚Äôt do it on stream.
---
You simply do not phase them, as simple as that. If during night time you have 3 layers with 1k pop each thats not a problem. Thats authentic.
---
What do you like about druid? Do you do a lot of endgame? What spec are you running?
---
It was not.
---
Will classic have cross realm BGs?
---
That's called BFA
---
I'm pretty sure they'll want everyone to create new characters specifically to try to get data on how to resolve the character creation problem.
---
Zooming is not as impactful as this, with this you can see if enemies are in tunnel or ramp in wsg for example
---
- Hunters are good for herb and mining since they can let there pet tank while gathering. But not many people have gold to spend early on.
---
- Not sure if there are good beast aoe spots for mages since most have an annoying ability or so. I could be wrong.
---
- Best starting proffeccion is skinning for pure gold by vendoring the leather. I think alot of people will try to sell bags early on.
---
- Best way to farm at launch is pure gold by vendoring stuff I think. So skinning helps. No one has gold and everyone is saving for there mount.
---
- Unlocking lockboxes is like selling portals. You get a tip from people by helping them open there boxes.
---
- Worce starting proffeccion at start is blacksmiting for sure. Its really expansive to level and not really worth spending gold on early game. Also enchanting is overrated imo since later on in the game its the designated guild enchanters with all the rare patterns making the real money.
---
Best class to farm gold while leveling is I think a hunter with skinning and mining. Mining because the midlevel Iron that will always be in demand because of the granates.
---
My oppinions.
---
Layering will kill the entire game until it's gone. You won't get any of this in a sharded / layered classic. Nobody cares though. You will care eventually, but it will be too late by then.
---
Guild Wars 2 handled it where if you are on an dead layer, you get a popup telling you the layer will close in 1 hour. If you choose to, you can change to a populated layer at anytime within that hour and get a small movement/xp buff (idk about the bonus in classic though).
---
It's a good way I think. This way, no surprise layer change.
---
he forgot to mention he played a NE female druid and /dance in the inn.
---
Why not make Outland invade Azeroth. You could move them into Blasted Lands + another unused zones. Then you could add Arthas to part of the plague lands. No need to constantly keep going into new worlds and making the universe too large to handle.
---
It's the same as vanilla. No changes, please.
---
Big big disagree. Being able to rely on nameplates for massive awareness is NOT good for pvp. It just kills opportunities that you wouldn't have with nameplates being shown from like 100 yards. Saying "just don't use it" is the worst possible advice you could give. Blizzard will fix this 100%, as /run SetCVar is the only possible way to achieve this in the beta currently (the other ways give errors).
---
As a counterpoint please see FFXIV as a largely successful pancake model about to enter into the equivalent of its Cata phase and with a hugely engaged and growing fanbase. Additionally it has an overarching story that is mandatory to even access the new expansion content something I personally thought they'd have to do away with after 1 expansion, yet here we are. 
---
Its about keeping old content relevant and having a large and diverse enough player base that there are always others playing, group content, an active world in each leveling range. Seasonal events in starter zones, fashion being the true endgame for many meaning the vertical nature of gear becomes less relevant, crafting, fishing, fates (world events) that level sync and are active in every zone. I am sure if they wanted to the smart people at blizzard could emulate and come up with their own ways to keep old areas and content fresh, they just choose not to.
---
Ok i'll break it down to you. I don't watch him a lot, i've seen a bunch of his youtube videos however starting from like a year ago. First of all, the one big thing that annoys people the most is that he claims he played vanilla but he has said earlier he didn't and it is very obvious that he didn't play it either. Like it's fine if you didn't play vanilla dude but don't lie about it to get views. So everytime he says "Oh i remember it being like this in vanilla" he is usually wrong for the first part since he's not a good knowledgeable player by any means but he's also lying since he didn't play vanilla.
---
He talks and acts like he's a great and knowledgeable player when it is very obvious that he isn't. Which again, it's fine to not know everything and not be the greatest player alive, but when you act like it and talk like you know a bunch of things that you don't know and then when called on it just make up a bunch of exscuses... well... that annoys people.
---
So every time i watch him and he just says "Oh haha i remember how it was in vanilla, everyone did this" No, they didn't Tips. Nobody did that and you also didn't experience it so why the hell are you acting like you did? I don't know why he keeps doing this, it's fine to just say he's a private server streamer. But i can't stand someone who lies like 100 times per stream and also acts like he's a great player when he just does so much wrong.
---
Alright, my mistake.
---
If you're doing it by yourself (which I probably would be), absolutely. I imagine a streamer or multiboxer could trivially get an escort of level 60s to help out.
---
It always was a thing:? Welcome to the WoW Vanilla my young, fellow friend. Where you can change a lot of things, but you have to use commands for this.
---
The thing they need to get on top of, and which they never solved yet, is finding a way of preventing that speedrunning or maximally efficient approach to the game, which is in and of itself totally legitimate, result in some players just leaving the rest behind in every way, resulting in effectively two communities -- the "hardcore" and the "casual". 
---
Developing an endgame meta in which progress and economy resets level the playingfield and keep the two groups interacting and relying on eachother, making sure the "hardcore" doesn't just become a closed ecosystem, is something they are really going to need to give some thought to over the first year of classic. 
---
The factor that makes possible exponential acceleration of the hardcore group was always the permanent, out of control, poorly conceived "economy" of the game. The fact that the virtual metal currency model they used doesn't behave like a metal currency in fundamental ways, i.e. that it doesn't depreciate in value over time, that there are no costs or risks associated with hoarding it, that there's no meaningful taxation, and so on, means that it's always been much too easy for individual players and groups to become effectively economic dragons with a perpetually sustainable advantage over the others, because again -- another basic design problem -- it's too easy to translate a gold advantage into a game advantage in WoW, and those advantages are much too impactful. This is also what stimulates the corrosive botting and service selling side of the game which provides an absolutely disastrous pay-to-win way to progress, which again once it is baked into the hardcore community culture just smashes the common ground between what becomes essentially seperate castes of players.
---
Loads to say on this but basically economy resets should be baked in from the start, otherwise classic is going to stagnate and devour itself in an orgy of toxicity, just as we saw in the original game actually and which everyone appears to have forgotten, pretty quickly.
---
Plus Zul Farak!
---
Which spec do you play? Is Enh just a dice roll ad they say, or do it have certain outplay potential and complexity?
---
Ayyy ESTP-A squaaad
---
anyone who needs a high level breakdown for layering strap in cause here we go: 
---
it's sharding but without crossrealm and they gave it a new name
---
No, that‚Äôs not a requirement for the game.
---
It's fine. You remember the game being harder because you were much younger and nobody had any idea what they were doing. People were likely stacking the wrong stats on gear, using bad abilities, not being able to play well due to potato hardware, bad connections, etc.
---
The game is not as hard as you remember it being, private servers have been inflating these things for years.
---
Nah it's more that streamers are essentially gaming reality TV stars and make people act like idiots.
---
Not to mention the abuse you get if you kill them.
---
Then you need a set amount of layers per server or this wont work. If you create layers (based on a queue) then you need to also be able to destroy layers, and move people away from the destroyed layer. Otherwise you just keep creating as many layers as you need for peak population, even when nobody is online.

August is summer

Wow 2
---
* mage can aoe farm, including in some instances, can't handle mobs that are snare/root or magic resistant
---
* feral can sneak pass by and tank mobs like some elites or low enough dungeon bosses solo for vendor/DE loot. Maraudon miss world can be farmed more widely. Hunter here too.
---
* every class can fish.
---
4. vendor, vendor, vendor. AH is good after a sizeable amount of players got their personal wealth going. You can stash resources like bars and stones to sell them much later on when a reliable market on AH establishes.
---
5. just like enchanters you sit in a city and yell your services for a tip. If you have UBRS key as any-class you can take fees for that too.
---
6. majority if not all crafting ones.
---
Yes, ap increases the dmg of death ray.
---
Lots of people posting their pristine systems. A lot of us don't care too much about adding beauty to our systems, and this thread is for them. Hell I should have dusted mine a bit but who cares, it runs cool and ill clean it next month.
---
I think they could put out a couple of new lvl 60 dungeons (like dire maul), then maybe heroic versions of dungeons? Small group stuff is more accessible?
---
That's actually true even if it sounds weird. The expansions arent expanding anything, you are just doing the same stuff on a different continent and the old content is instantly pointless to do besides transmogs.
---
That was a max time frame, too. They said absolutely no longer than phase 1 but if they can turn it off earlier they will
---
theres this place NW of duskwood that filled with werewolves , so easily AOE-ed and skinned by mages
---
Not saying it is, but does anyone know if you couldn't run the same command in Vanilla?
---
If you *could*, would it be treated as a bug today and removed, since they're not fixing bugs that were present in original 1.12?
---
Hm, good question. I'm not sure, I guess tanks have no place in PvP, so that's why I decided to not include it, whereas the rest can play a couple of roles there.
---
Blizzard needs to be fact checked.  Rofl
---
do you think the only solution is start a WoW 2 and not stack expansions ontop of each other? they wouldn't even have to start at 60 but just have a new WoW and not having any of the mistakes they have on retail now
---
Lvl 1-45 Holy/Disc
---
Lvl 45-60 Shadow
---
Go Holy PVE heals @60 for easy gear
---
Go shadow and melt face when you reach desired gear lvl
---
Does. Not work. Madseason tested it and wasn‚Äôt able to restore one of his alts.
---
A lot of really good points. It's such a shame modern MMO publishers and developers do not care what they are distilling the genre down to. 
---
There's a couple of better MMOs in development, smaller developers, I really hope they get their games out and we can vote with our wallets on what we want.
---
Lol keep your condescending shit to yourself :)
---
Because you need one for every 5-man dungeon, but only 2-3 per 40-man raid.
---
I like their versatility and higher skill cap than most classes in world PvP.  They just have so many tools to use... Also like being able to both tank and heal dungeons with a single spec (HotW).
---
I‚Äôve never raided seriously as a Druid, and typically end up drawn to either warriors, rogues, or mages for that purpose, as I‚Äôm an extremely competitive person and really look pushing for #1 on the damage meters, or main tanking if I‚Äôm not DPS‚Äôing.  Trying to decide if I can just ignore that part of my inner fabric and just look at raiding on a Druid as a way to get gear for PvP.  Not sure that I can... still have a few months to decide tho.
---
Layer destroying should only happen during maintenance. You need a very basic script that checks whether or not the daily peek population would fit into less layers. Yes? Remove unnecessary layers. No? Everything is fine
---
All we know is that anyone who was invited for the last one is invited for this one
---
Flash in 2019
---
Still better cable management than my beast machine. I'm too ashamed to post a pic.
---
They said that they will *most likely* release it later on, but it won't be there on launch.
---
i wouldn't personally call disabling crossrealm (which lets be honest they've done a garbage job of that, too) and increasing the shard size  "creating a new system"
---
&gt;\-10 levels above the boar making it grey and hitting for the same?
---
Player level makes no difference on damage taken. A level 30 and a level 40 character both take the exact same damage from the same mob if they have the same armor.
---
Me neither, I‚Äôm still upset about ZG and ZA, and all the Cataclysm revamped dungeons (still super mad about Scarlet Monastery and Scholomance, in particular...). They are my main reason to create a character in Classic! I like the retail version but all the removed content really annoy me.
---
i thought Westfall is best for 10-20 not to mention random LFG for deadmines
---
It's bad for speedrunning, which is what most leveling guides focus on, but aside from being slower due to no self-healing, it's not too bad. Hell, it was one of the most popular classes in the game back then.
---
Lol August 26th is the end &gt;.&gt;
---
Ah you are right. But I've an Horde brain. Don't think its wize for me to go there.
---
Yeah, good point, I've always leaned towards pvp and these 4 classes can do a few roles there, whereas tanks don't really have a place, but this might not be very objective.
---
All servers will be different, from what I've seen, there are more servers with an overwhelming advantage to one faction than there are somewhat equal servers.
---
Sprint trinket in badlands
---
I agree with you. To hide all of this shit makes it feel so much for fragile. Just give us a choice! Make an estimate and make so many servers required with two "sub-servers" each. Those sub servers could hold 6k players each and eventually get merged when the player base begins to dwindle down.
---
oh damn. been there :P hahaha
---
Lol shut up retard
---
is this fake news ? i saw videos with hundreds of player in human starting zone and it is smooth as glass.
---
&gt;private server noobs
---
The players claiming the content is too easy for them are noobs?
---
Hmmmm
---
This is what the upvote button is for.
---
Because of leveling or are you talking about all aspects of gameplay of the class?
---
I remember refusing to wear a hat I got in STV because it looked like shit, but it was maybe 10 levels higher.
---
This is straight up not related to Classic WoW.
---
I help lead a guild on the beta with more than 450 players on the PvE server and none of them are streamers. Every single person I‚Äôve explicitly asked played in Vanilla. Some of those are alts, but we often have around 80+ online doing content at any given time.
---
Phone is from 2014 lol! My lighting isn't the best if flash wasn't on... I might as well send you a pic inside my colon.
---
The clip had nothing to do with layering, doesn't mean improvements can't be made.
---
Server transferring will not be available for the first few phases. No other services will be available for the rest of vanilla... at least that‚Äôs what they said on a blue post somewhere.
---
What do you find the problem to be when it comes to druid? How does it compare to Shaman?
---
I raided ZG and MC without any enchants or crafted items. My Professions? Enchant/Tailor
---
Sounds horrible. It decreases the chance of running into the same people if the pool of players that can end In your shard is larger. Or would the shards be strictly separated from each other? I understood they wouldnt.
---
Pally is the most fun tank in vanilla if you got the friends willing to back you up for fun times ahead.
---
Honestly it's great fun.. (no raids, 5 and 10 man ONLY)
---
"But pallys can't tank" we used to do it and it was great fun, just OOM is wipe.. so get that dps to burn them the fuck down fast.
---
oooh another one
---
Well, they explain it in the results. I play warrior, doesn't seem far-fetched with their explanation.
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
I sort of wish they would have picked an earlier patch level -- I think some things had already started to go wrong by 1.12. But it's fine.
---
I am worried about server transfers - I know it was in late vanilla, but it was corrosive to the server community.
---
On the fence about the cross-realm BGs. The queue time is way better. I don't know.
---
I personally dont intend to use any addons, but eventually after I hit 60 one or two might be downloaded. Never going to use a quest tracker or anything, but a threat meter is probably necessary at 60 and small things like that. I mythic raid currenrly with only dbm and recount so I'm used to the UI.
---
PoE: Legion coming up.
---
Yeah, it's still casual.
---
Sharding and layering are the same thing just a different scale. Dw tho ppl arent complaining anymore for some reason you get yelled at for pointing out its the same thing and we should fight for its removal.
---
Oh well catering to the ppl who wont be playing a week in is a fantastic plan to kill classic so they can prove to us that we never wanted classic.
---
On a good note, we have an updated client for the next big pserver wooo
---
If it's a wipe then it's a wipe you fucking feign and save yourself the repair bill.
---
Edit: going down with the ship means nothing.
---
And people don‚Äôt get why some of us want to avoid streamer servers.
---
Lol .."if u want a serious PvP disadvantage just turn it off"
---
I appreciated your explanation. I was just pointing out a consequence if the system was implemented like that.
---
Not a care given.
---
Yeah, too bad raids really call out for maximum optimization.
---
One of my favorite examples of this is the faction war.
---
In Classic, the faction war is almost non-existent as far as scripted events goes. There's no ongoing battles, no dramatic cutscenes, and only a handful quests pit you against enemy NPCs. Once you get to higher levels and leave the strongholds of your faction, you spend more time with neutral factions and do stuff for them instead. 
---
In Retail, the faction war is everywhere. Villages are on fire, you're put in lore-filled scenarios where kings and queens and warchiefs duke it out, there's entire zones dedicated to the war. 
---
Yet I prefer the way the faction war is handled in classic. Why? Because it's the *players* that instigate most of it.
---
Through the expansion I've never been a fan of the faction war. During vanilla it felt like the Alliance and Horde had achieved a rather effective peace between them. There were still conflicts, but they were instigated by low-ranking officers and in the vast majority of cases, players themselves. It was a **voluntary effort**, and if you didn't wish to partake you didn't have to. Heck, if there were quests that were just way out of your comfort zone you could opt not to do them, and it wouldn't affect any main story requirements, achievements or anything. 
---
And if you were willing to partake, you began to hate the other faction not for lore reasons, but personal reasons. I did a short stint on PvP server and man, nothing made me hate the other faction like getting ganked, having the quest hub camped and seeing an enemy player standing there, knowing there was a 50/50 chance he'd either attack or leave me alone. 
---
It also made the racial leaders more likable. They weren't forced into doing unreasonable actions nor did they have to act stupid just to give the other faction a chance. They were there to defend cities, and made attractive targets to the enemy faction who went after them not for loot, but for prestige. You didn't spend half your time at their side, instead you got to visit them occasionally when finishing important quests. It might be hell for those who want to continue the story from WCIII and develop the leaders, but I prefer how they were back then - high-ranking people you rarely interacted with and rarely met, because they were that far above you.
---
Too bad it's air cooled
---
So, level 19 deals 75-80 damage on hit into like 30-40% damage reduction, but level 30 deals 70 into 0%. Math doesnt seems to be right here
---
See Asmongold is actually finding bugs to help development! 
---
And people where compalining he only cared about his viewer count
---
Haha, love this. Does that mean there's no complexity/outplay potential?
---
Can you clarify your response for me? I'm pretty sure the answer isn't than 1264, as most explorable areas give either 50xp or 100xp AFAIK. 
---
Do you mean level 12, +64% of the way to level 13?  That sounds plausible. If so, do you have an exact XP total?
---
Literally anytime I take a personality quiz I get INFJ. Except this time, I got INTP... I don't even know who I am anymore...
---
He‚Äòs Right, stop crying
---
What do you mean "most people don't have that nowadays"? You may not but plenty of us do. It's just about how each person prioritises stuff.
---
So you don't like to heal?
---
The game is going to be crowded at launch even with your beloved layering, so it's pointless. It literally does nothing except ruin the game. Blizz can be lazy and not have to make more servers, and it saves them time once the population dies down, so they won't have to merge servers. It's only about $. Just like subbing to get beta access, just like paying early to get your character name, etc. It's not about what's best for the game, it's about the $. Everybody knows sharding is the literal worst. All the talking heads in the past said the game was DOA if it had sharding. They said they wouldn't even play it. All your favorite streamers. Nothing has changed, they all just sold out.
---
True! So far rolling a dwarf priest beats joining a group of 20 friends playing horde :) Only dead fish follows the flow, right?
---
^ this.
---
Thank you so much for this! Im feeling a lot more calm about choosing a server after reading this. Really nice of you to help with this information!
---
Is it a leather shield though
---
What does that all even mean ? Who even talks like that ?
---
Amazons New World
---
Westfall, Loch Modon, and Darkshore are the three zones for 10-20... Darkshore in my experience has the most/best quests. You can always do DM at 20 before heading to Redridge or Asheville.
---
I often feel that with my Druid. How does Shaman compare? I feel like I'll miss the mobility of a Druid.
---
The problem with this is that splitting players between classic and retail shouldn‚Äôt have a huge impact on how many people you see in game, but splitting it 3 or 4 ways runs the risk of killing off low or even medium population servers.
---
I freaking hate it. Its not my thing.
---
Orc/Human - only choices
---
Its summer
---
oh they've publicly released that for people to look at?
---
&gt;pvptard coming through
---
ok kid
---
Their sustainability plan was Cata. Yet most of their core players left after that expansion.
---
Of course it is new content. After 8 month of 30 lvl classic there would be no one left to play it.
---
He never put any of those reactions on youtube
---
I work in an office and can confirm that that's what it's like
---
&gt;Agility gives Melee Attack Power for Rogues, Hunters, &amp; Druids (in cat form) 
---
and shamans
---
Might be a nitpicky thing, but consider using an SSL certificate for your website, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is free and easy to use.
---
The biggest issue with leggos and titanforging was the pure rng aspect. That said, it still did reward, on average, people who did the content more than the people who did it less. The more you do the content the more chances of getting lucky. So it did still reward for playing the game.
---
However it's having to wait for that luck is trash imo.
---
The earlier raids were a godsend for me back in the day because I was pretty young. Even though I was knowledgeable and had my mechanics down, I could never make the 2-5 AM Tuesday or the 11 PM - 3 AM Sunday/Monday raid times that competitive raiding guilds adhered to because I had school.
---
Usually, once a new raid came out, all of the hardcore people moved on to that, but at that point they were veterans of the old raid so you could do a PUG on a Friday night with 7/8 people who didn't know a fight and 2/3 people who did and get by just fine.
---
Haha, well good luck figuring it out!
---
Yes I mean level 12 with 64% exp to lvl 13.
---
I did quick maths in my head
---
Wow, a beta testing a new system in a beta :o
---
There are so many problems with this though, i feel like people haven't actually thought it through.
---
What happens when one server inevitably is super popular? As in all the layers are full and people want to keep playing there (because it's a streamer server or whatever) and the population never dies down? Will the layers just exist forever?
---
I guarantee some servers will be so popular that you will need layering long after layering is gone on other servers, maybe even forever.
---
AYAYA(„Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•
---
With the amount of people on launch, it‚Äôs possible darkshore will become the least congested and therefor the fastest 10-20 zone.
---
That piccolo that makes people dance.
---
But then wouldn't a mage fit better, since in comparison Shaman has much less spells? At least in vanilla it seems so.
---
Indeed, I hope it stays.
---
Imagine prestige WoW.
---
I was thinking in terms of vanilla progress but you could gut the raids and just make it expansions?
---
Bare with me...
---
Prestige 0:
---
No boosts/buffs/xp bonus
---
MC, BWL, ZG available
---
Must complete World Bosses and all dungeons, or hit rank 9 to prestige up.
---
When choosing to prestige:
---
All items sold and gold kept. Profession level reset but rare+ patterns kept.
---
Prestige 1:
---
5% XP boost, 5% inc benefit of base stats, 2x gathering items, 25% chance extra bonus added on crafted gear
---
MC -&gt; BWL/ZG
---
Must complete Nef + Hakkar or hit rank 10 to prestige up.
---
Prestige 2:
---
10% XP boost, 10% inc benefit of base stats, 3x gathering items, 50% chance extra bonus added on crafted gear
---
MC -&gt; C‚Äôthun
---
Must complete C‚Äôthun or hit rank 12 to prestige up.
---
Prestige 3: 
---
15% XP boost, 15% inc benefit of base stats, 4x gathering items, 75% chance extra bonus added on crafted gear, extra enchant slot for chest, legs, weapon maybe?
---
MC -&gt; Naxx
---
Must complete KT or hit rank 14 to prestige up
---
Patch 4.1 was the first time I reacted to a patch with "Hold on, these are actually really bad changes".
---
Removing original ZG and ZA, along with the Cata HC difficulty nerfs (may have been in an earlier hotfix?) really was the beginning of the decline for me. Gave up raiding soon after, never set foot in Firelands or Dragon Soul apart from getting transmog stuff many years later.
---
Even if that's true still going by what you said still mail &lt; plate aspect comes into play. either way it's definitely something that should be looked at.
---
This is normal
---
I will always main Dps and picked Elemental Shaman because of the fantacy. Have you seen Chain Lightning?! How can one not love it.
---
My second choise has always been Mage. Its more the fantacy than the rotation.
---
Yeah but I've thought that switches in the middle of gameplay that may put you on a different layer from your guild or main layer wasn't planned ?
---
We'll say what blizz says on the matter, I really hope they manage to make it work and bring it to retail to replace sharding. Retail would benefit greatly from it I think.
---
Rule 1.
---
I think one of the main reasons why their are many people watching the streamers play classic is because it's completely new to them. It's still wow, but most people between 12-18 have never stepped food into classic.
---
The biggest strength of classic is the way that it tells its story's and how you can explore it and create your very own experience.
---
Modern wow for me was just leveling up asap and doing dungeons to get gear. After so many expansions it just doesn't feel right anymore.
---
Nah
---
I miss ZG so much, I cannot wait to run it again. v
---
Dont try and rush to end game. The joy of vanilla was the journey there and meeting all sorts of random people along the way. While bfa and legion were all about end game, vanilla definitely isnt. Let the nerds rush and get burnt out.
---
Gief
---
U do know there is no LFG tool? You cant just queu up and get set in a random grp that are ported to the instance? I might just read it wrong :)
---
Furthermore tho, there is no xp for completing dungeons, only kill xp + whatever quests you have.
---
Agreed completely. Sharding is a cancer for a MMO that wants to be build on community. Blizz is catering to the retail pop that is gonna try the game and quit in a week instead of the vanilla community that has wanted this for years.
---
Either they think that the inital boom in subs will be worth more then the sustained income from long term subs or they just wanna ruin classic so they can be like "see we told you that you didnt want it!"
---
I drank water to get my energy back quicker. As a rogue.
---
Streamers don‚Äôt get in the way of my gaming in the slightest, in some cases, they‚Äôre decent entertainment when I can‚Äôt otherwise play myself but can click a YouTube video of highlights.
---
Sounds like fun. When I get professions that fit my class I usually outlevel it and then it becomes a game of catch up until I get bored of that character. Then it repeats.
---
Needs goblin to make the XL ones but can be used by any engineer.
---
Teldrassil owls are a good choice if you want slightly faster levelling. They can learn screech which lowers defence. I think Joanna got his world record with an owl like that
---
Jesus. Give them time to fix bugs like these. They have JUST started testing the technology with the beta &amp; stress test. It will not look like this come release day.
---
I subbed 4 accounts (we had 4 OG vanilla accs in my family) just to get a chance at beta.
---
I got in the stress test so it's a half win.
---
I will 100% sub to reserve a spot and a name so I can play on the same server as my friends.
---
Not everyone will be rushing to 60. There are plently of people who either don't have the time to rush or just want to take their time and enjoy the world. Would love to play with newcomers once Classic hits.
---
Dont feed the troll guys...
---
Yeah, Shaman fantasy is awesome, no question!
---
Yeah and classic wow will be unplayable at launch with out it.
---
Because in Classic you have no aoe aggro abilties. You have to lead the group. Mark the targets. Know the layout. Deal with errant dps attacking the wrong mob, all with limited resources to make any of this happen. It's a constant juggling act and quite stressful.
---
In retail you just press the "aggro all the mobs" button on repeat and your "take less damage" button on CD. There is no challenge or skill involved until M+.
---
The Priest trinket is absolutely sick, especially in combination with a full T2 set bonus.
---
Isn't that the whole point? There's nothing that stops blizzard from putting them in an instance of their own like Ony, but they're out in the world and so you have to get your shit together and defeat/outsmart the other guild(s). Their removal fits right in with the rest of retail's philosophy, of course.
---
Yeah sure, whatever. The only reason i am not downvoting you is the fact that John Cleese is awesome. Crying about streamers starts to get a bit old.
---
Pendulum of Doom. It's the slowest weapon in the game, (4.0 speed. As slow as a weapon can possibly be) so it hits super hard. It's level 39, so it's perfect for the 30-39 PvP bracket.
---
Slow weapons are amazing for Enh Shamans because the slower it is, the higher each swing's damage is because the DPS is Dam/Spd. But when you're getting Windfury procs, they don't care what the speed is. They just go off. So you're getting 3 hits that all hit like a truck at the same time. And on top of that, it has a chance on hit to do another 250-350 damage, which is like 1/4 of a mages health bar at that level.
---
Throw a Crusader enchant on it. It's insane.
---
The only sad thing about the 39 bracket is that you're only 1 level away from getting Stormstrike, which would be even sweeter. 
---
It's BOE, so it sells for like 300-500g on the AH, but it's not a world BOE. It only drops for Uldaman, so you can actually farm it. Farming Ulda for POD is actually a great way to make money at level 60. (Once the economy is established)
---
Warriors love it too.
---
So by that logic i meant that he didnt use it between 40-60.
---
Streamers aren't the decision makers. The game will be taken good care of by the developers, and it will be a good fun game when it's done. If you don't like the stupid stuff that streamers are doing, then just ignore them, and play classic for yourself and don't worry what other people are doing.
---
Humans didn‚Äôt even know Kalimdor was a place until relatively recently.
---
Hi, /u/justsomespecial
---
Paladin was my first vanilla char over level 40 and I'm 100% sure that I'll never make one again. Its the most boring class to level and play. Also no fan of tanking and I hate healing.
---
Druid is something I could have fun with. But mainly for PvP with a balance/resto dot/hot and kite spec. Also flag carrying in WSG is really fun to do. Weird thing is healing on druid feels fun in PvP.
---
&gt; because of stupidity. 
---
Keep making posts like this and you can make it July.
---
Honestly streamers are great. It‚Äôs honestly amazing to watch a highlight video on YouTube of asmongold losing every duel and blaming, lag, or spell batching, or crits. It‚Äôs very enjoyable.
---
PvE twinks.
---
That WILL be a thing in Classic.
---
As much as it has to happen, mid cave or camp of enemies is not the intended area for this to occur. It should be reported and will get looked at, this is what beta is for, to catch these types of unintended behavoirs of layer in order to fix it
---
Hahaha what a bad sport.
---
So *that's* where all those whelps came from.
---
If they roll horde, are they really your friends?
---
So that's why there are always server troubles, they use/used HP....
---
People think WotlK had so many players because it was the best expansion.
---
Factually it benefitted hugely from Arthas, the community that BC and classic built up and on top of that some volatile players who liked Blizz catering to them. The volatile players and the Arthas players left, the players who grew this game through classic and TBC have been bleeding out ever since. Great business move to cater to a bunch of game hoppers rather than your dedicated year long fanbase.
---
yeah but to a lesser degree
---
Reported it as well.
---
I expected it would be unpopular considering anything negative about a streamer is downvoted immediately. We must protect our favorite streamer! It's pretty silly.  I'm happy to watch a stream occasionally. I however have no interest in having to deal with the fans and haters doing stuff in the game that would be extremely unusual for normal gameplay.  It's not fun if you're not in on the joke, it's just a nuisance. I have no problem with it, I'll just play on a server that doesn't have one of the big names on it. I really wasn't saying anything that crazy.
---
Alexensual told me I was a Blizzard shill and I believe him.
---
Truest post ever 10/10
---
There is some quest in Elwynn forest on Alliance side iirc that gives you something that sleeps your target. It's completely unique and you can only do the quest once.
---
Enjoy your summer, enjoy the outdoors, then play wow all fall and winter
---
Actually not having cross realm BGs gives an incentive for PvP players to roll on the underdog side, as in the dominating faction they'll have huge waiting times. Since this doesn't matter anymore, there is literally no downside to joining a dominating faction.
---
Maybe on private servers.
---
Not enough people have run guilds to vote correctly on this issue.
---
Why wouldn't it be? Blizzard 'confirmed' dungeon elites are doing correct damage.
---
I don‚Äôt think three servers would be the way to go if you‚Äôre talking about them all three being up at once we have to keep the base together imo. Personally I hated cata mainly because of the talent system changes. I would rather see one server with vanilla , tbc, and woltk. All at 60, or 61 for tbc with the xp it takes for 55-60 or near and then wotlk at 62 with the same xp or even more. That way at 60 you can progress through the 60 content, and if you‚Äôre forced to go back at 61 or 62 to help out friends or guild mates it‚Äôs not like it would be dead content it would still be mildly challenging. I do believe the leveling aspect should still be there though without the dramatic changes 10 levels bring.
---
Well, you're wrong because he did. Quin deleted his char 3 days ago.
---
Here is his VOD from last night; https://www.twitch.tv/videos/430605982 
---
So unless he managed to level a paladin from 1 - 30, gear it and everything in less than 2 days to get it to be identical, **you are wrong.**
---
Should have read that back then (and have today's level of self reflection) - I'd have been a Priest from the start instead of a Rogue that I stuck with all through Vanilla because I was a noob and did not care to level another character.
---
3th time in 2 days? Try out the LFG monday treat. Also there should be a discord for LFG.
---
Exactly my feeling...I should have done a survey that included the question ‚Äúhave you run a guild before‚Äù
---
Erm... okay? It's against the rules though.
---
FFXI released three expansion packs without raising the level cap from 75. Each new expansion brought more content, classes, dungeons, etc. so people had a reason to play the new stuff.
---
Best of all: 
---
A fresh character had three expansions‚Äô worth of endgame content to explore, not just one. It boggles my mind how each WoW expansion sweeps away all the old zones, quests and dungeons from before to be forgotten forever.
---
It‚Äôs worth noting that FFXI equipment is swappable in-combat, so that helped the ‚Äúsidegrade‚Äù paradigm, but surely there must be a world where Blizzard figured something out.
---
Imagine a world where TBC kept the cap at 60. All the new raids, Karazhan, Black Temple, etc. New 1-60 leveling zones. New content and NPCs in old ‚Äúendgame‚Äù places like EPL. New spells sprinkled throughout each class‚Äôs 1-60 leveling experience. New tier sets and raid gear that focused on off-specs or TBC-specific stats (shadow resistance?). People could mix-and-match gear for all kinds of reasons. Fresh characters got to look forward to TWO expansions‚Äô worth of endgame stuff side-by-side.
---
It‚Äôs a forgotten dream.
---
Bring the "hard mode" concept in from Ulduar!
---
not nitpicky at all. It is 2019 and SSL should be standard for every website with login or any user generated content.
---
This.. is.. perfect üëåüëåI agree 100%
---
It's not about Asmon, it's about you letting one random person on the internet affrct you so much for no reason, what is wrong with you?
---
Lord man that's such shitty way to summarize what I just wrote. It has nothing to do with wanting to feel close to streamers. I never said I wanted to feel close to them. Not sure why you chose to interpret it that way at all. My point was the experience on Beta and the community there is far different than it will be on live. Currently as we speak 145k+ viewers are having their perception of classic shaped by Twitch so I think that's a pretty important point to be made. Furthermore about your "measuring enjoyment on social proximity to particular players" statement - I don't know how you personally remember classic but the memories I have of it are all the great moments I had with particular players. Community is everything when it comes to this game.
---
Imagine caring about internet points. Cuck.
---
People will go arguing about lupos and broken tooth, bit the real pros remember Snarler best bro for life. Up until 1.3 Snarler in Feralas kept 100 to all resistances when tamed. Together with the Dragonstalker or giantstalker set and training points, good ol' Snarler could enter MC with 240ish to all resistances before buffs. So it was the only pet able to actually offer meaningful DPS increase in MC due to surviving the AoE.
---
Since all the "unique" pets abilities will probably be gone in Classic, I would personally go for a pig on leveling (eats everything so it's cheap maintenance) and I would get the zul gurub bat on 60, which also has 1.0 attack speed. You can get that without having to camp brokentooth for a week, plus I have the impression that bats can screech too (not sure about the last part tho).
---
My dude, spamming this post every day is a very good way to tarnish your guild's reputation instead of upping it.
---
It was an inference. Last week they said the number of invites being released would decrease from here on out because the numbers they needed had been met at this time.
---
One of the worst memes I‚Äôve ever seen.  Wtf does the pic even have to do with whatever the text is trying to convey?
---
Except it is. WoW is for anyone over the age of 12. Stop being an idiot.
---
Do you mean Recipe: Savory Deviate Delight? On private servers they sell for about 1g and those servers are a pretty accurate representation of how the economy was on vanilla servers.
---
This is the thing we don't know yet, because Blizzard haven't said anything on the subject. But it's hard to imagine this being a problem on most servers that don't have streamers. The flow of tourists that play until level 6, 12, 20 etc. and hate it is likely to be massive. A lot of people will not endure to the grind to 60.
---
As for streamer servers? Prevent more people from joining after a while, offer free transfers to lower pop realms. If it's still not low enough? Maybe they have to look at dynamic respawns, maybe they do eventually have to have a couple of permanent layers if the entire server population doesn't want to move. Who knows; we don't, yet.
---
Im finding a server they are not on and enjoying my slow go at it
---
A long quest chain in Ashenvale gives you a rod that turns you into a Furlborg - just don‚Äôt complete the quest chain because then you lose it.
---
I'd say arms, especially on a PvP server.
---
It will be awesome to see them learn the hard way.
---
‚ÄúSpec in fire and arcane‚Äù ha

I don't disagree with you. I think you're making some fair points tbh.

RETAIL HARD VANILLA EASY
---
HE can be right all he want's, the condescending shit isn't necessary. As far as crying, pu-lease
---
I wish it had 15 years of content. Retail needs a complete overhaul to be playable again, because right now the only thing that is ever playable is the current patch, which leads to burnout and boredom. They need to completely change the game, stop adding 10 levels every expansion, stop making old content irrelevant the moment something new comes out. IMO to make the game playable again they need to make ALL the old content playable, timewalking was a step in the right direction but it's not enough. The entire world needs to have real incentive and meaning to it again.
---
The quote is from an interview with Ion Hazzikostas at the same media event. https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=340
---
I've heard a couple other varying descriptions about other things, but for layering, Ion uses a lot of emphasis when he says **"and we promise we will do this a few weeks in"**, which he seems to really want to assure players that layering won't be be around any longer than that.
---
Asking the real questions here.
---
Give us servers with level 10 cap, level 20 cap, level 30 cap, level 40 cap, level 50 cap and leve 60. :)
---
man, tbc really is the quintessential wow experience imho...The day that comes out will be hype
---
Very much so, thats why people get a 110 boost when they buy the game. And when people do lvl from 1 they usually do it by mindlessly blowing throw dungeons over and over untill they reach current content.
---
It's ok, he's wrong - you can respec via the book in Ratchet.
---
Port retail to vanilla, keep fresh servers. Remake BC to keep positive things like heroic dungeons and raids/Arena etc. but no LFR/LFG maybe the premade list that still requires you to talk and travel to the dungeon/raid.
---
You think they will? Lol
---
They'll scream about how the tank is shit then leave the group
---
Not only is it not a requirement, it's not how wow works. Quest reward greens from Northrend are more powerful than a lot of BC tier pieces. The power level basically gets reset with every expansion. There's no need to add extra catch-up content or do any nonsense besides steadily releasing TBC, Wrath, Cata ü§Æ, and so forth.
---
Some people are having more fun. Some people also enjoy retail?
---
It is nice to see people having fun though!
---
Arena scum. Tbc was the decline
---
It‚Äôs a comparison meme. The virgin (insert something here) means the beta. The Chad means the alpha. 
---
Basically saying real leaders command while poor ones yell
---
Part of BfA's problem is there is so much busy work and tasks to do. You're constantly given objectives to do, which means player creativity doesn't have room to flourish. When you don't have the pressure or bread crumbs of what to do next, people think up fun things to do together.
---
Quin always does stupid stuff for attention. First thing he did when he got into the beta was submit a bug report for the NPC's not selling gear with stats on. So yer, wasting development time.
---
The thing that you had no idea it killed you in WSG
---
Ghost wolf is sick for movement, not Druid level but not far off and with gear Ele/Resto is a monster burst machine. Great depth to class as well.
---
Retail bois downvoting af. Enha is useless in raid. Has the lowest uptime when using nightfall, so even there he sucks big ones. It is by far the worst dps PvE class in the game. Even hunter is better in Nightfalling.
---
90 days :)
---
That‚Äôs fine until you need 13 different t sets of armor and weapons and try to keep it organized
---
But then they said world
---
I level arms but I see the benefits in fury.
---
Reddit has am uncalled for hate of all streamers. There are some things this community is so one sided on and I have no idea why. Streams can be very entertaining, but outside of this one post you will only ever see hate.
---
I think they do realize that Classic have to go OSRS way, because no matter how you want to deliver TBC (separate TBC servers, character copy, re-release of TBC as it was) it will either split the community, make Classic content irrelevant or kill Classic only servers.
---
Since Blizzard agreed on re-releasing Classic, they already decided not to go back in time and re-release TBC after.
---
They are preparing to go OSRS way. It's just logical, and best business decision that they could possibly do.
---
Half of Classic players DESPISE TBC, and that half will not play TBC, but it will also stop playing Classic 2-3 years after launch.
---
Blizzard knows that this will happen, and they aren't going to make TBC a reality after Classic.
---
They WILL deliver TWO big fat options to the Classic player base : TBC or 1.13. And 1.13 will absolutely dwarf TBC...simply because it's NEW and it will be built on Vanilla game design.
---
Because he represents the community....
---
I love these lazy add-ons, hopefully that mount will return with classic. Stuff like this really makes a difference when you're switching between different types of gear a lot
---
I don't really think you understand the difference between the 2. They are at the ground level the exact same, but the way they are supposed(they are still trying to finetune it) to be deployed is completely different.
---
See ya in 90 days!
---
Welcome to exactly what NA players have had to deal with for years on every private server.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O67VlF84T8
---
Also got defender. Going horde warlock. Both pvp and pve
---
Do you have proof? That goes against everything Bliz said about invites
---
Just my random idea I came up with.
---
For previous tiers, if in queue for X time (scaling the waiting time depending on how many tiers behind) then put into group with NPCs to complete the content. Would actually be fun to still do the content with a group of NPCs I think. Of course this would require development of competent NPCs and has other issues, but just a thought I had.
---
The client could even check the average amount of people queuing for X tier in the last X time, and add NPCs accordingly etc etc.
---
Which ones look good?
---
Sorry, I prefer to throw it at a person who is full of it :)
---
ITT: People that don't realize that ugly/beauty is subjective and arguing over it.
---
Well now I do, thanks for informing.
---
attack speeds are normalized in 1.12, broken tooth etc are just normal cats.
---
I levelled as both in Vanilla. Both are viable. Fury is more consistant damage where as Arms is not. With arms you can be doing modderate damage for a bit them BLAM a massive hit out of no where, making the build feel incredibly good. So in short, my answer is play the one that suits your playstyle more.
---
&gt; it seems to me that TBC is significantly more popular than Vanilla with the WoW playerbase as a whole. 
---
Well, it no longer is. It was, a year ago. Now it's almost an even split between TBC and 1.13.
---
And it will go worse for TBC once everyone will experience Classic.
---
I quit during TBC, came back during Wrath, with LFG tool, cross server queues, etc.. and the dungeon runs were completely pointless.  That time coming back during Wrath was the shortest attempt at playing WoW again, only lasted a few weeks.  
---
Even vanilla/classic is way too easy (level 30 BIS groups kiling level 38-40 bosses already) but at least it's not a button push to victory like retail.
---
No no dude. 
---

---
So what's the solution, there needs to be some form of progression. If content is added, what's the incentive for doing the content if it doesn't potentially progress your character?
---
do some p90x and be as "ripped" as you can when classic hits. 
---
Just as people start noticing any potential changes, you will already be playing classic and you can always refer to it as the source of your magical transformation...
---
I wonder how many times people like that will actually bother to waste 1-2 hours of their own time before they either learn some patience or quit classic?
---
First WC/Deadmines right after release will be hilariously toxic, but from that point the community will steadily improve as the worst of the ragequitters quit the game for good.
---
You want the people who turned WoW into a casual cash grab to update the game? Fuuuuuuck that.
---
If you roll with a DPS, it's viable. Let them do the killing, they can get groups of enemies and AOE (if they have and AOE), keep them healed, don't stop ever. If you're a priest, you can wand to support between heals. (Wands do really good damage.) Shaman can melee. Druid can go cat form.
---
If you're solo, go DPS spec. In pre-60 dungeons, it doesn't matter if you're heal specced. You can still heal fine. Just like non-prot specced warriors can still tank well if they put on a shield and go into Def stance.
---
Honestly I see people quitting a dungeon if there's no warlock
---
Just assume a very nonsense spec, gear that is even more mixed and unoptimized than usual and just not much guidance through the game. She just went her way and did what she liked and thought made sense.
---
fishing have to be the worst thing to do in regards to time invested.. i mean what can fishing bring , gold-wise / profit wise , to a character ?
---
No it wasnt
---
For real, it's been a blast, the level 30 meta is awesome. Overall it might be short lived compared to lvl 60 content, but I would love to see a Project 30 server show up, official or not.
---
Plenty of time. I will allow you to panic if we hear nothing from blizzard during the beta-period regarding layering or see improvements from people in the beta/stress tests.
---
perception?
---
Two devs giving conflicting info on the same day, one of them being Ion with a long history of "sugarcoating"... I feel like until Blizzard officially clears this up, being optimistic about it would be a mistake.
---
1080 is standard
---
This is true. Fury can be just as good in PVP, but does require better gear to perform than arms (even more so at end game).
---
‚ÄùMemes‚Äù
---
you'll regurgitate that one week from release as well
---
"GIVE THEM TIME GUYS ecksdee"
---
They didn't disable crossrealm, they made fragments of the same realm and sharded between them, it's the same thing.
---
&gt;for cata dungeons  
---
Cata dungeons were fantastic though. Some of the best 5man content the game ever had until Blizz listened to the community and nerfed everything.
---
i wont attack you if you wave to me , i always let horde players in alliance zone go when they just fishing or farming .. but some of them are just high level hordes ganking us low level alliance.. 
---
thats why i prefer NE , can stealth to avoid horde gankers for a bit
---
Not worth it, I‚Äôm just going to sub the first week of August.
---
You are implying that you still had time to do your hair, not realistic!!!!
---
Ok, fair, but it‚Äôs so minor it may as well not exist compared to stoneform and EA.
---
This probably has the same answer as loot trading. It was possible in Vanilla, it would make customer support to do dummy work. Yes it will be an option.
---
Private servers
---
You all have completely killed the word toxic used in this context. Any opinion that differs from your own is toxic it‚Äôs so lame. More people have quit playing BfA than are playing it, so while I‚Äôm glad you are having fun with BfA but there are plenty of lessons Blizzard can learn from what is going on with the Classic Beta and the buzz around it. Do you not remember the wall of no that has been trotted out for a decade to shoot down anyone wanting a classic server? But, people being exciting for classic and pointing it out is unnecessary and toxic because YOU are having fun with BfA....
---
This is incorrect behaviour and you should report it, Blues have posted on the official forums that the sharding tech isn't working 100% like it should yet.
---
Leveled a hunter to level 40 thinking we get a shield at that level.
---
that is why i said Westfall is perfect zone for random Dead mines invites on Zone Chat.. it would be impossible to get it in darkshore
---
Been there loong time ago , its fun untill that 2 h BRD run turns into a 5 h nightmare xD
---
I don't wave at filthy alliance scum, FOR THE HORDE!

---
I like him, because his streams etc always seem to have really good positive vibes, and often getting the community together for stuff like this. While he can have bad opinions, very often he shares my opinions on what would be good for the game and what blizzard needs to do. As for being funny, I do find him funny, and often his humour can be mistaken for elitism or whatever, but I guess that's just different sense of humours. 
---
Still, I rarely watch his streams and usually just CatDany's highlight videos.   
---
I disagree with the 'secret club' thing, but I think in a way we feel he is often a good mouthpiece for the community that just wants the game to get better in the same way as other community members such as Preach.
---
This isn't to say he's perfect in any way, but I do enjoy his content.
---
Blizzard kicks themselves in the ass with the layering/sharding stuff. The thing about queues that they don't understand, is that it makes the game FEEL even more like an actual MMO. It makes the game feel more in demand, like people are actually playing it. When you log in and get sharded/phased/layered to your own special realm, it feels like a dead game that nobody is playing. 
---
It also gives you the feeling that other people are waiting to play, and you don't want to disappoint then by wasting your time jumping around in Stormwind, so you work hard to get shit done.
---
Bring back the queues, they have a greater psychological value for your game and for your player base than you realize.
---
I dont know who would be foolish enough to wAste Money on 3 months of sub to just get a chance at getting into the beta? 
---
And make a comment about the ridiculousness of that act to disway any suspicion...
---
Chronicles of elyria looks very different, right back to the roots of MMOs but with a modern engine and features. 
---
Question of whether they can pull it off with a small developer team though.
---
I just feel like it's really important. What if you roll on a server that has to be permanently layered because a streamer also went there, or it just happened to be the big PvP server or whatever? I just see a lot of potential problems with no answers, and it seems like blizzard is set on doing this layering thing now no mattter what.
---
Thank you for the info , i never knew Darkshore have best XP/hour quest wise .. i leveled a NE once in Darkshore but always went to westfall due to it's close proximity to Deadmines
---
Rotating expansions like sets in a card game is friggin genius. It would solve so many problems and open the door to so many awesome development options; Blizzard could really take WoW to some strange places, safe in the knowledge that if it's a mess it's only temporary.
---
&gt; they would be stupid not to change up retail 
---
Idk... I already see streamers crying over shit just like vanilla players did, which is what got Blizz to change the game and ruin it in many ways.
---
but every starting player on new server need cheap bags , 6 slot linen and 8 slot wool is easily achievable ..
---
Now that‚Äôs commitment
---
You are not supposed to change layers while logged in to the game.
---
I love dwarf rogue, but gnome is just better. Ask literally any of the best rogues out there.

I don‚Äôt think you understand economics... like at all.
---
The currency has been depreciating from day one and that‚Äôs exactly how people have been able to amass fortunes. 
---
The economy becomes meaningless pretty quickly if you are constantly resetting it, and without a persistent gold sink depreciation and inflation are inevitable.

My response was to Itakio who was conflating that Stabber's latency mattered when determining whether a melee is in range or not. He believes that a increased latency on Stabbers could be a reason why the melee distance is so far. My response was trying to explain why that's not the case.
---
I'm not stating that there isn't a melee leeway, only that the latency of a person who is following behind someone doesn't matter.
---
To respond to your clips though, they are pretty much conclusive proof that there is a huge leeway and it's also bugged as fuck.
---
Nobody is going to sell their account just because they got beta. That‚Äôs crazy.
---
Hi, /u/YounesBounes
---
I don't think it's hype.   The game will be popular AF up until people beat Cthun, realize there's only one dungeon left, and then start to phase out.  The MC-AQ time period will be a lot of fun.  It'll be a year or so before people burn out on it but it will be a fun ride.
---
Vendor bags aren't too expensive anyway, maybe you'll make a couple coins but the time your spending making bags could be spent on something else, like farming beasts that drop many grey items.
---
So does this extend the time you can control your victim? Or what?
---
Nope, then I will be dissapointed just like you, my entire point is there's no reason to panic about something we know is in development.
---
I would still play though regardless.
---
Have a nice day!
---
Lets say you have four hours to play each night and the queue is 12 hours, the math does't really work out huh?
---
nice finds. Lol'd at the video with a melee hunter without a pet. Good fucking times.
---
Yeah, there is definitly a point to what you're saying. But imo, combined with class campaigh, artifact weapon, legendary farming, suramar, m+, world quests and raids i was occupied constantly for sure. The experience was on rails, no doubt about it, but it was still fun. It was a different kind of fun than vanilla, but thats not a negative. 
---
Imo, blizzard should focus on what made legion so much fun for so many people and commit to it on retail. There is value to retail in that its perfect for testing new tech and stuff.
---
Classic in my eyes is blizzard second chance to make things right. Use this opportunity to make an infinite game with the feel of vanilla. This isnt something that needs to happen right away, but in a few years (3-4 is my guesstimate) even classic will have gone stale and repetitive.
---
Im going off topic here from what we were original discussing but i really think we as a community have to start discussing what addition we would like to see down the line. Patches of the quality we want for vanilla will take alot more work than a standard patch for retail. No way we would be happy with "current patch Island" or gear resets and such. I personally have zero clue as to what could be added to enhance the game, all I know is that i dont want gear inflation, higher level than 60 and new continents that make the old world obsolete.
---
To answer your last paragraph, bfa is legion put in a compressor. All the things are there, but are made pointless or boring.
---
480 is also standard
---
Kiting world bosses to cities got patched and fixed in vanilla.
---
the addons in your list in your HP-Post will probably not work out of the box.
---
these are vanilla 1.12.1 addons, not 1.13.2. 
---
no classic branches no forks, and the latest commits are around 1-2 years old. 
---
question: why did u link these?
---
MMO mouse helps greatly.
---
I have 1-9 on the mouse, with shift, alt, ctrl, ctrl+alt(rebound to caps), modifiers, that alone is 45 keybinds.
---
so you don't love vanilla
---
Its the same game but diffrent quests. Could be fun to try out the other side. Pre-cata I was more alliance focused but now I'm going Horde.
---
It surely helps a bunch against locks because it enables you to save your first iceblock for Death Coil or to dispel DoTs. Lock is definitely a hard matchup regardless, but it does help a ton. I'd argue it's even better against priests, because their fear is on a long cooldown. 
---
Escape Artist mostly helps against what, Rogues, Warriors? Classes you should be able to beat regardless. To me, it seems like a "win more" ability whereas WotF works more as a catch-up mechanic in matchups mages struggle in. 
---
Now, I might be biased because my first character back in the day was an UD Mage, but I honestly believe it to be the superior racial in PvP.
---
I will log in so god damn fast
---
There's a crazy high quality one I downloaded from this sub with all the FPs, boat/zepplin paths/levels you should be in each zone at. I would send you it, but I haven't the first clue how.
---
Use the owl and then get screech from carrion birds in west fall later.
---
This is what pisses me off the most. they knew they lost a big part of their player base, so to make more revenue they hide the kong anticipated and awaited Classic bets behind having an active subscription, in essence saying "pay us to have a chance to maybe play the beta"
---
It wouldn't ruffle my feathers as bad if it was guaranteed but it is not. It's just a chance.
---
what rock have you been living under ?
---
Even with the subbed restriction there were a few sold accounts going for well above 1000$

---
Encountered that multiple times on stress test , i was killing boars around Razor Hill for skining and every couple of mins id get "layered" into a new layer. Was happening mid combat all the time. The boar i was fighting would despawn and all the ones id have killed would respawn , good thing they were not hostile ...
---
&gt;Also holding aggro is tough especially when you are teamed up with a well geared dps.
---
That was always the DPSers fault prior to Wrath. If the tank dies in a pull, healers fault most likely. If the DPS dies in a pull, thats their own fucking fault. If the healer dies, thats the tanks fault. There are some exceptions but thats been the general rule of thumb.  
---
Aggro management isnt just he tanks job!
---
Riding was at 40, 60 and 70 in BC ? ops doesnt make sense
---
OK, in that case, go Mage. You can play 90% of the game clicking the same spell if you so chose.
---
The #nochage camp (I am one of them) fought for a Classic version as close as possible to Vanilla.
---
NEW ADDED CONTENT to Classic, that is JUST new dungeons and raids, without touching everything else, is not here nor there when talking about #nochanges.
---
It's NEW CONTENT, that keeps the world RELEVANT. It doesn't hurt Classic, it only makes it LIVE LONGER.
---
What would be the problem if, for example, Blizzard adds Karazan as Tier 4 raid in Classic, and the attunement for Kara is clearing Naxxramas?
---
The argument that new gear, better than T3, will bring imbalance, is moot...because T3 ALREADY is damn fucking powerful.
---
There is NO REASON not to add new content in Classic, as long as it's ONLY new content, and everything else stay the same : skills, classes, talents, etc.
---
I don't get the streamer hate. Is it meta or in? I think I'm getting to old to understand it. Also why do you have to insult them? That's not realy a good start for a discussion. I think I will visit this reddit a few days before Classic launches, check which server the streamers chose and play on antother one. Simple as that.
---
When you use Mind Control Cap it makes the target like a pet, but of you use Eyes of the Beast, you control them in First person.
---
Obviously, because it was a one time/fresh experience. A spectacle by itself and not due to the actual content, something that you enjoy a few times and will not enjoy if you repeat it daily, for months. If you level to 5 for 100 times, I have a feeling that you will not like it anymore a nd that you will feel just as you feel now on live.
---
I find it crazy how many comments assume this is how it‚Äôs supposed to behave on release. It‚Äôs either a bug (this is a beta), or they‚Äôre simply testing the technology by moving people between layers (this is a beta.)
---
Blizzard has been really clear about the fact that you‚Äôre supposed to stick with your layer semi permanently and definitely not change layers while you‚Äôre logged in unless you join a party with someone on a different layer, at which point you permanently switch to that layer.
---
Awesome , will check out later !!
---
What even is that thing in the middle?
---
You can reserve names two weeks before Classic launch. You sub that day for 15$. You dont use the sub for 2 weeks you waste 7.50$. Im ok with paying 7.50$ so I can just hop right in and go on launch day.
---
Attack speed wasn't normalized til the 2.0.3 pre-patch
---
Ahh I misunderstood you then. Thought you meant LFG Queues.
---
It is my understanding Darkshore is better xp/hour (Dungeons often just slow you down) 
---
But I always go for some lvling Dungeons just to break the quest grind :)
---
That's my plan! In phase 1, everyone won't have the best of gear, so a [0/30/21](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxhscMdxVxsoxo) would give you the mana pool to heal fine because of 5/5 heart of the wild (+20% int). You'd also have -0.5 sec off Healing Touch, 15% mana regen in combat, 10% healing touch reduction AND nature's swiftness...not to mention all the feral talents that will allow you to tank 5mans, compete in pvp (you can drop 1 point in HotW for Nature's Grasp) and still be able to solo quest decently well in your tank gear!
---

 We decided to roll on Crushridge on launch, a large guild of Swedes. The language barrier destroyed our guild and everyone moved to different servers lol.
---
Dude looks like Peter Crouch
---
I did all that managed to get the stress test though and it just makes me want classic more
---
Is it really that easy in the beta? :(
---
No need for CC and such?
---
1.8 (1.10 for ranged) normalized weapon abilities that were not just regular swings (auto attacks, auto shots)  
---
pre 1.8 the formula was
---
(attack power / 14) \* average weapon speed as listed on the item + weapon dmg roll (min-max dmg as listed on the item) + skill dmg
---
from 1.8 onwards the ''average weapon speed listed on the item'' was no longer relevant as all attacks were following a preset value
---
two handed 3.3
---
one handed 2.4
---
daggers 1.7
---
and ranged 2.8 (from 1.10 and onwards)
---
this lead to players gravitating to weapons with better dps over just a slow speed. As the amount of damage gained through attack power was not calculated as 
---
attack power in dps (atp /14) \* 3,8 on a slow weapon
---
but
---
attack power in dps \* 3,3 regardless of how slow or fast the weapon was

You are 100% correct for the majority of them but I guess you cant blame people with little opportunities for trying to make a buck.
---
The funniest thing is seeing them try explain to an educated  person in a good career what it is they do for a full time living. 
---
Again this is the majority, there are some  great streamers in this community  like Soupasoka / Kargoz who seem to have a good head on their shoulders.

I've little to no experience in WoW in general as I played only for a couple of months many years ago, never reaching end-game. I'm stuck between a mage and a priest, wonder if someone could help? 
---
I wanted a magic class that can be utilised in group pvp but also stand their ground in 1v1 so I narrowed my search down to a mage and a priest. In the past, I enjoyed classes that would be able to switch between DPS and support roles so priest fits pretty well to my understanding. The issue is, I don't want to be stuck as a healer my entire life, as I would eventually find it extremely boring...
---
Is it viable to stay as shadow priest all the time and still find it quite easy to find people to do dungeons and raids with? Or will there be an expectation that unless I go full healbot mode, I won't be picked? To my understanding, it's not really easy to keep swapping talent trees between heal &amp; dps depending on what is needed or what I decide to do on a given day?
---
PS: I'll likely be a casual, playing roughly 2-3 hours daily.
---
Wtf is that
---
did you recall your pet or put it on passive? if he keeps attacking it will instantly put you back in combat
---
huh , i dont even like streamers and their constant promotion on youtube and here..
---
but they dont destroy classic WOW , how can they ? not many people watch streamers religiously let alone worship them constantly or blaming them constantly ...
---
just dont watch streamers and it is all fine .. WOW classic will rise or fall on it's own merit
---
Proof?
---
Get together with one of the guild's tanks and duo-level. You'll both be helping each other level faster (Warrior is much slower than Priest solo) while working on bonding. The tank-healer trust is important to build.
---
Another plus for War/Priest duo leveling is that you will be able to easily form groups for dungeons whenever you want, even if nobody else in the guild is on. Just put "LF DPS: Uldaman have Tank and Heals" into any zone chat and you'll get 30 people wanting to join. Everyone loves a group that already has tank and heals.
---
Numbers always drop on Twitch after a while, no matter the game.
---
Still, Classic BETA (with emphasis on BETA) is doing FAR better than BfA did in the same time frame.
---
Like three times better.
---
And it's just A BETA,
---
While you might prefer classic, all the arguments for classics existence apply for TBC. People deserve to be able to play the version of the game they enjoy (this is the core of Classic being revived). Classic through to WotLK are built on a similar design philosophy with WotLK being the most removed.
---
Healer classes doing DPS is stupid though. The dps specs of healer classes should be support and not pure damage, reserve that to glass cannon classes that have less utility.
---
To me the best part of classic classes is the fact that some are there to support and it's not exclusively about damage meters. 
---
I will play a warlock despite knowing mages will do way more damage and I don't want it to change.
---
Cool - thanks for the write-up. And this will apply in classic from the get-go?
---
Am I missing something here? The blue post clearly says it‚Äôs a bug and they are working to fix it.

Pservers utilize packet sniffing tools. All the opcodes are client side so it's just a matter of having some people running the sniffer as they play. Once the session is complete the sniffer dumps the packets. A separate tool parses it and inserts the data into a DB where appropriate. 
---
There's no need for wowhead, the live data is all parsed and massaged once collected.
---
Yeah unfortunately random internet guy needs to tell people how it is sometimes. If you aren‚Äôt prepared and you are leveling in gear that is 5 levels or more below your zone. Your character is going to feel like trash. 
---
Also If your are strategic you should never really be questing or killing mobs that are higher level than you. A lot of people run out of quests to do and end up hacking through higher level zones and that also feels horrible. 
---
As a rogue or warrior, you should be able to kill at least 3 mobs in a row before you need to eat/bandage. Bandage is off cooldown by mob number two usually FYI.
---
that everything else will look like it stands still.
---
This, pretty much. Only a small percentage of players chose to "waste time" doing not-current content.
---
It's just as if someone would say they have fun leveling 100 chars to 5 on the stress test - chances are you will like it a few times, but after that is a NO for most of the people.
---
It's gonna take you about three months.

Born in 1990. I just can't stand old graphics, ruins my immursion. Had the same effect going back to play half life 1 after I'd played more modern games, I loved half life 1 first time round but It killed it after stuff like skyrim with my HD mods and crisis spoilt me.
---
Blizzard was pretty specific that this wasn‚Äôt true. Why do you think it is?
---
ASAP, blizzard has been doing well on the new expansion launches only mess ups really have been bottleneck quests.
---
I feel like the original game you were able to talk to the other faction through /emote [insert text here]

Been confirmed as a bug by blizzard already

Someone is in for a copyright lawsuit
---
There's streamers in every game, yet I don't watch them and they've never interfered with what game I like or how and why I like it. I don't see what this fuss is about.
---
and it doesn't happen between zones, only continents.
---
Is this a thing?:
---
- Leveling only in classic from 1-60
---
- Every expansion scaled to 60
---
- Gain perks for BC/Wotlk/Pandaria etc through doing activities/raids/pvp in this content and power up a designated tree
---
- raids only accessible in expansions by completing necessary perks through questing
---
- power gains not because of more item level but through perks like reorigination array in uldir
---
Downsides:
---
Not possible to rush solo through every content
---
Achievement farming requires groups
---
Upsides:
---
Every Content stays meaningful
---
People can decide which content they want to do
---
Itemization will be interesting, mixing gear from several contents
---
Log in and log out when I really can't go on anymore. Then sleep, get up as soon as I wake up and play till tired again. No regrets

I only meant to suggest defragmenting actual hard disks. Most operating systems don't even let you try to defragment an SSD, because it's very bad for it, and because files on an SSD are already located across several locations deliberately.

It's like a gimped destruction spec. It's managable and you can do a lot of damage, but conflag, improved corruption and nightfall was pretty awesome in PvP and you'll lack those.
---
But yeah, you can play PvP just fine with this spec, considering you won't need to respect and you'll still have an awesome raiding spec. Maybe you can swap a few points here and there, while still getting SM and ruin.
---
Seduce/nuke will still work to some extent, and if you're left alone you can be a heavy turret.
---
It's a win-win situation for everyone, we get to see streamers play a better game, we get better content and it's much better to watch something they genuinly enjoy.
---
They also make more money because better content brings more viewers but why should that bother you?
---
That too
---
Oh cool, if you waited till end of the timer for the gnomish cap, then eyes of the beast, would you be able to extend the time you can control the target?
---
Am I missing something here? The blue post clearly states it‚Äôs a bug and they are working to fix it.
---
Those 30s are hardcore players who have been level capped at 30 farming gear for days.
---
Then you dont play the first week or two til the game dies down? If ur only playing 4 hrs a night its not like your gonna be competing for server firsts anyways.
---
I work 2 jobs (40+ hrs a week) and attend college full time (40+ hrs a week) so ima be lucky if i get 1 or 2 hrs of play time a night. If i literally cant get in during the initial launch ill deal with it and on the weekends (when im free if im done with hw) ill sit in que for 12 hrs and play for 12 when im in the game.
---
Que times are not a deterrent for me, id prefer that over sharding anyday. If i wanted a single player game with NPCs i group with once and never see again, id just play retail. Classic is never going to be a better single player game with random NPCs then retail is.
---
As I said, we don't know, but something like free transfers to other realms if you get stuck on a super high pop streamer server seems sensible.
---
There are answers to every problem, some answers are just nicer to hear than others. Completely scrapping all sharding/layering this close to launch is not one of them, otherwise Blizzard would never have bothered in the first place. I do really think people are blowing the problem way out of proportion, though, considering we're still in beta and the game isn't even in a ready state yet. Not to mention what we've seen of layering/sharding so far is *so* few and far between compared to the rest of the game where everything is fine and people are having a blast.
---
ENFP-T - I'll be playing Warrior/Hunter, still undecided what first
---
It's just something different. I'm not convinced it's better but any change from the daily duldrums of live bfa is going to seem glorious..... At first anyhow.
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying but I don‚Äôt understand how you would end up in that state. Are you thinking of a contrived example where we go from like 10k concurrent users on a server to like 1k where the 1k don‚Äôt log off for like 2 days?
---
Since we'd want to keep the level cap at 60, we need to focus on vertical progression if we want to do soemthing like this. So my proposal is to focus on events rather than static expansions. 
---
We have a lot of different planes of existence in the Warcraft lore we can possibly visit. On the top of my head there's the Elemental plane, the emerald dream and the twisting nether. Also there's a possibility to visit the spirit realm, the shadow realm and the twilight realm. 
---
I guess there could be some event that triggers that makes it so that we get access to one of those places for a set time through a portal that later collapses or something. They don't have to be an entire continent worth of content, but maybe a zone or two with some content, either solely for lvl60 or spread over the entire level range, and a dungeon or two. Have the quest chains in these places branch back into the old world to keep it relevant and people moving about.
---
I think there could be potential for a lot of great adventures and stories to keep Classic fresh and exciting for a long time. That all depends on if they really want to build on it or just keep it as a legacy service though.
---
Either way I'm just happy to come back and experience it all again (this time from the opposing faction, for the horde!).
---
You‚Äôre right and wrong. Taurens have larger melee reach than other models, (7yards or something??) But when two taurens are attacking each other they hit from like 10-15yards away while stationary. Even if it‚Äôs Tauren v Tauren it should only be 7 yards, (assuming that‚Äôs the correct value) you don‚Äôt add the two reaches together as you suggested in your comment. Taurens are funky but there‚Äôs clearly something else going on here if this is happening while stationary.
---
Verycoolguy must've passed through
---
Everything else aside, #nochange is like saying 'feminist' or 'masculist'. My point being that some are reasonable and some are not. 
---
Now, the issue also comes down to you just said you're fine... but ONLY with new content and NO other changes.
---
That doesn't describe what happened with OSRS at all.
---
There are also other issues with your proposition such as if you don't address balance etc, then simply 'adding karazhan' means you would need to rebalance tune etc a raid that wasn't even designed for level 60.
---
On top of that, you then have to realise that the addition of gear from karazhan would mean even further stat inflation etc.
---
This then means that a lot of aspects of vanilla start to become affected. 
---
Imagine the gear gap between someone walking around in full t4 vs a fresh 60. It'd be even more of a joke than just naxx gear.
---
A lot of things start to break when you start adding new content but aren't flexible regarding any aspects such as "skills, classes, talents, etc".
---
ESPECIALLY when you consider that not all classes scale with gear equally.
---
You mention that an argument such as that is 'moot' because T3 is 'already' powerful but further widening the gap can have much bigger effects than you might expect, and realistically I would say that you have to expect FAR more people to get to naxx gear if you're keeping the servers up longer term and then adding content on top of that. Issues that started to become apparent but were 'fixed' by an expansion coming out aren't going to disappear like they did.
---
Also, I would add, is that if people end up in t4 t5 whatever gear that IS going to have an impact on the "relevant world". Especially in regard to boosting and people progressing through tiers etc. 
---
Or simply even in terms of a guild progressing t1/t2 trying to farm mats for consumables as a t4+ guild is steamrolling them and controlling the market. Sound fun? Managing that guild's roster sounds even less fun.
---
RuneScapes model has been to add content horizontally rather than vertically in terms of levels. This strategy has been rather wholesome and I hope blizzard attempts to hire a community manager from their team for classic.
---
Getting old fast to watch for some people maybe. I‚Äôd rather play classic capped at 30 than do anything bfa related.
---
My downvote has nothing to do with your streamer comment, you truly don‚Äôt understand the amount of work that‚Äôs going into making classic a thing.  I completely understand not wanting to play on one of the streamers servers, and you‚Äôre completely justified in that. When it comes to development of classic though you‚Äôre wrong, there is new content that‚Äôs being developed, just because you can‚Äôt see it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not happening. They weren‚Äôt able to just copy the client from vanilla and send it to us, they had to build it on top of the existing engine they‚Äôre using now, and that takes a ton of work. They are more than justified in charging 15 a month, especially for the demand we all have for classic.
---
I'll give it a look, thanks!
---
No point in fighting when other rogue has evasion up, kiting is correct here, except for that monstrous leeway lol
---
True. Because we thought we‚Äôd wanted phones, but we didn‚Äôt.
---
Wouldn't they need to have been funny at some point in time to make a comeback?
---
I played uhmm vanilla the last week or so. To get prepared for the release. Ive not had such a fun time in a game in many years. Currently level 25 and i cannot stop playing. 
---
I am so ready for the release its an amazing game, which offers so much more than retail.
---
&gt; The amounts of whispers of people thinking you had nothing better to do than cast a hundred water
---
... or people who expect you to find two strangers to help you port them just because they are to lazy to take a 5 minute fly path.
---
&gt; Just fucking replace the content, or put it on a seasonal cycle. Even if each season is a couple years long
---
What does this mean though? Like it would just be 1-60 then BfA? The what of TBC-Legion content? All deleted? That's not reasonble. Honestly I don't think there is a better system than the current one. In the end WoW was never sandbox anyway.
---
Hear, hear.
---
Nope, doesn't scale with anything. Bloodthirst becomes more dmg at 2100 AP I believe. And it's not worth to stack rage to get bigger executes. If you're in execute phase the only ability you wanna be spamming is execute!
---
i just can't... Why so hate for streamers? People post clips from them cuz its funny to watch and we all are very exited for Classic. So we share in excitement. Is this really that bad?
---
I disagree with the toxicity point. With LFG it's easy to hate on the group, but when you enter the dungeon with your friends who you've met questing, different attitudes prevail. I remember the days of the whisper for invitations to join dungeon groups. It's personal and friendly.
---
Why is the icon for sunder armor a broken sword? I know we agreed on NOCHANGES but this is honestly unplayable !
---
Also, if people thought blizzard was going after private servers before they‚Äôre going to be going after them even harder one classic comes. A bunch of the top servers have already said they‚Äôre going to be shutting down once classic comes out.. so they won‚Äôt be an option for much longer.
---
See ya there!
---
Get Fish, make Deviat Supreme, sell it for 20 Gold per Stack on the auction house and boy oh boy you aint gonna need gold anymore.
---
Since fishing is boring and people rather level up and play the game, if you invest into fishing early you will be rich.
---
My only issue with this is yes I want 1.13 and the design philospophy of classic but I also want the class spec/rotations of later expansions.  Just my opinion but I like the more complex rotations of the later expansions(not including legion/bfa) just find combat so much more rewarding.
---
I want bfa 2
---
It really isn't
---
PREPARE MY GIRLFRIEND FOR THE HARDSHIPS AHEAD. SHE MUST ENDURE. 
---
She never played WoW, but will start when it launches, so I'm feeding her all the books and videos on it.
---
Poor thing, I can already see her being sucked in the way I was back in early 2000's, when WoW was announced.
---
Yeah, the number of people who are *actually* going to be "like Joana" are pretty fracking small. That guy is a machine.
---
It's not just time played, or "following the guide". It's the approach and HOW he does things efficiently that trim the fat.
---
You're not a hero or a demi god at level 30 in retail either.
---
Stayed in mulgore for weeks after level 10, because the first barrens mobs I saw were skull and I thought I had to beat them to enter that zone.
---
we wish
---
Rogues personality leaning: Sneaky stab stabs
---
im sub again and a few days later i got in.
---
But thats not how its supposed to work..
---
Can't lose a duel if u bubble hearth.
---
I had so many abilities on my mage that I dropped the extras onto my second hotbar and never looked at them again.
---
I remember they had a weird side-back movement (if you approach them slowly)while they autoattack, but most of the times the mobs just turn on the spot like their hit box is pin down on the centre . 
---
I remember this cause I used to fuck around as a tank with rogues/melee  dps-ers during raids, by turning the bosses around circles.
---
They have given us details about how layering is supposed to work.. and this is just sharding, not layering.
---
I agree with that tbf
---
Can confirm, people in fact perform office tasks while working in an office.
---
Maybe in a parallel universe Blizzard will learn from the release of Classic that they can apply the same objectives to retail WoW. Retail is tanking hard. They need to change it. Imagine current retail WoW with Classic philosophy? No LFR/dungeon finder. Making epics actually rare. Cutting the number of spells in a rotation in half. It would be really cool.
---
hate ? do you read the post ? what i said is constant content-less repost of streamer video , as if they are paid to promote the streamers. and there's the guys who constantly post Asmogold this Asmogold that as if he is paid to mention this streamer's name everywhere..
---
mind you this also happened a LOT on youtube where your search feed give you endless 'asmogold excited' 'asmogold shocked' obvious clickbait videos.. same issues happening in Overwatch where people constantly trying to promote XQC ..
---
DISCLAIMER : 
---
i dont  mind a streamer video posted but there got to be initial explanation and discussion on the content of video , instead of just a 'title' , a 'video' and that's it
---
1. You have to carry both sets always with you. Travelling to the bank all the time is just wasted.
---
2. I will tank all the time even as fury, because youre the tank, you can build every group you want, you can take just casters with you to get your stuff...you need.
---
3. Priest ofc
---
4. Taking the Ony Neck instead of the tanking Trinket. /facepalm
---
5. If the enemy dodges and you can overpower, you can switch to battle stance, use overpower and back to berserker stance
---
6. Yes, take Protection Stance with a Fury Tank Build. Best TPS nobody will get the aggro from you.
---
7. There are tons of furys... fuck it if you roll human ure fucked... all ppl want swords...fury...rogues...and even hunter. :(
---
8. In pvp go for Arms 2H-Build. You wear Plate with Stats, since you dont need to be hit capped or need expertise (weaponskill). Str. Stammina Crit and lets go!
---
Level as arms, carry a spirit set, keep a shield, duo level with a healer, shammy if horde and paladin if ally. Duo leveling makes things slightly faster but that depends on things like mob density too.
---
T3 looks great except the head, the headpiece looks ridicilous.
---
it's bad because this sub just becomes an advertising page for streamers with clickbait titles for 10 second twitch clips.
---
I think they might have triggered a merge manually to see how it would go, as well as gauge any feedback from threads like this. Or accidentally. Or it was the result of an autoscaling policy, in which case threads like these are helpful to debug the cause or at least the consequences in particular cases.
---
&gt;Thrall used to attack her as well.
---
God damn it will be so nice to see Thrall again, the one true Warchief of the Horde (the alternative universe of post-WotLK doesn't count).
---
I thought it has a min. lvl requirement. Was madseason's char. Lvl 10 or higher?
---
Citing twitch numbers are definitely not evident of anything, I should have known better than that. You right
---
We used to kite teremus to bolvar becase he dropped sweet blues and those blue draenei crystals, he definitely used to get killed by bosses
---
The method by which you aquired legendaries was awful.  
---
But legendaries were fucking awsome at the end of the expansion. WHen it was quite easy to target the ones you wanted.
---
The must have talents are as follows,
---
Intimidation- This is your pet stun ability and helps a lot for my certain playstyle. It allows for you to catch people if theyre trying to run away so you can get close and concussion shot, or it allows you to run away by stunning them and giving you time to activate cheetah and get away
---
Bestial wrath- Also a must, a lot of times mages will freeze your pet and try to get in your dead zone. Unless they severely out gear you, you can easily still win by using bestial wrath and having the pet do all the work. Plus the 2 min cooldown is worth the 18 sec buff that gives your pet 50% extra damage and immune to all immobilization effects. No fear, no sleep, no root, no nothing. Unstoppable. 
---
Hawk eye- Make sure its 3/3 because you need the max range. You have the longest range in the game, and the only people that can realistically reach you to even hit is mages and locks that specced into their range talent as well. Just gotta keep distance and kite back. 
---
Bestial swiftness- You need your pet to go as fast as possible. Hunter is the only class that can keep up with normal speed mounts AND kill them at the same time. You literally cannot escape hunters. 
---
Pathfinding- Its more of a minor talent, but itll put your aspect of the cheetah at the same speed as ghost wolf and cheetah form. Very worth it, i never had to buy a mount ever. 
---
I also recommend improved revive pet, because in pvp situations, they do sometimes focus killing your pet first because they know they can handicap you like that. Especially in bgs. So with it, my mana wont go to nonexistant and I can rez it as fast as i can bring up a mount.
---
LMAO Classic WoW (spongebob) cleaning the mess after BFA
---
Why even have a gaming computer if you can only play 20 hours a week? Either just skip playing or sort out your life so you can play minimum of 60 hours per week. I'm also a casual player since I don't really have time for hardcore but I will be doing 120 hours first few weeks then just chill play like 80 hours a week. 
---
^^^/s
---
Well the two problems i see:
---
1. with population going from x - 10x you need to destroy layers unless you always have a set number of layers, which introduces new problems.
---
2. Some servers wont lose pop. Big streamer severs, main PvP servers will always stay high pop, so how will you ever get rid of layering there?
---
If the whole point of layers is to make sure that there are no queues (which is the only problem it would solve compared to just having no layering/phasing) then you need dynamic layers that can be created and destroyed. And if you have that then people will need to get phased.
---
1. You might need to offtank occasionally in endgame.
---
2. Not always. About as often as expecting a shadow priest or a feral druid to heal.
---
3. Personally, I'd prefer a priest.
---
4. Expecting never to have to tank, so not bothering to gather gear and learning how to.
---
5. Changing stance depends on the situation and need for it. Stance dancing means to change stance in order to use an ability only available in that stance and then changing stance back again.
---
6. Again, depends on the situation. You can tank in any stance. The effectiveness of your tank will vary alot though.
---
7. Well geared fury warriors tend to be in the top of DPS.
---
8. Usually, a mage would counter a warrior in PvP, imo. Warriors with decent gear and skill are great in PvP. Armour depends on your situation. Usually, you'd want to pick your armour depending on what type of PvP you'll be doing.  
---
That's my two cents worth.
---
i find the endless promotion of twitch streamers a cancer to every game forum , whether it is WOW , WOW classic , Overwatch , ESO and other games i followed..
---
discussion about games mentioning a streamer's video is fine , but starting a post with only a streamer video and a 'title' is just plain advertisement
---
I think a possible workaround to this is allowing players to copy their lvl60 char to a TBC server, their lvl70 to wotlk server etc, so you effectively have different versions of the same character. And can level on the previous expansions server.
---
See you know how it was
---
Priest, by a long shot. I find them incredibly relaxing to level as you cast two offensive spells then wand the enemy to death as it ineffectively pokes at your shield. You can reliably kill orange mobs without ooming, useful for some quests. Once you get to lvl45 you can switch from [Disc](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVzGsA0oZZxML) to Shadow and blow up absolutely everything.
---
Very flexible class at 60; you can go holy and be an amazing healer from MC to Naxx, go for a [tri-spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrs0bZbezzZVMgzzt) and enjoy being a valuable pvp/raid support class (may even avoid respeccing this way), or stay shadow and be an evil little PVPer (and *possibly* even a raider if your guild is understanding).
---
I'd never, ever be a paladin cause then I'd have to play alliance.
---
Ahh yes, the ability you don't really use and all those bosses in five mans you need to stance dance like after Edwin gets done with the deep breath air phase.
---
Cata had the biggest launch in the history of wow actually 
---
[Source](https://i.imgur.com/nabkKDF.png)
---
They'll learn soon enough. I remember it was a big a day when you finally let the druid tank or the hybrids DPS in a raid lol. I mean they're entirly useless but they gave it a good go.
---
Yes, it's blizzard that needs to be fact checked, the only people with the CORRECT numbers and source that needs to be checked.
---
Makes sense.
---
From wolves to undead to dinosaurs you work your way to true strength, Until your a badass guy with coloured shoulders in a group of 5 diving into a molten mountain to recscue a dwarf princess or halt the production of soldiers for a literal firelord that you will later get your whole guild organised to stop. Step by step our characters do become heroes, but they weren‚Äôt born that way, didn‚Äôt start out that way. We made them get there.
---
this got nothing  to do with WOW classic , it is about steroid induced body building or the classic natural body building.
---
You're a good dude
---
Watch this video https://youtu.be/6V9FyWhtT5M
---
I'v paid $30 in the past for a beta key, would do it again.
---
No idea to be honest, it's been 14 years since I've done it. I believe it was patched out in BC.
---
Not living under a rock, 1000 for a beta account is not a thing if you could cite then I‚Äôd be more than willing to accept what you‚Äôre saying. A quick google search found a couple for sell around the 400 range, so I guess 1000 isn‚Äôt too much of a stretch. I guess I for one just don‚Äôt see the value in it, I stand by my original comment, that‚Äôs crazy.
---
&gt; return the 1-60 pacing and world as the primarly leveling experience
---
This doesn't work for a themepark MMO. Eventually you will have done the leveling content and wouldn't want to do it again. In essence you would have beaten the game. Leveling in a game is a system with a hard start and hard end. Once players hit the hard end, some may want to play again, but realistaclly most will move on to one of many many many many other games they have access to today.
---
WoW needs to embrace what it is and simply strive to be better at it. A themepark mmo with a heavy focus on instance content. It is not and hasn;t been a sandbox mmo in anyshape for most of it's life at this point. And it can never be one, the core system for wow is not made for it. That's a WoW 2 level of change, not an expansion's.
---
It's correct when Blizzard says so because THEY HAVE A FULL DATABASE AND WORKING 1.12 CLIENT. 
---
NO ONE ELSE DOES.
---
Are you sure I shouldn‚Äôt just start a new character on Light‚Äôs Hope and pretend to myself that it cures the horrific emptiness I feel from Classic not being released yet?
---
How long did it take from subbing to getting the Beta invite, if you don't mind sharing?
---
Give my mans here a soapbox to preach this gospel.
---
*scratches neck* y'all got any more of them beta invites?
---
Good thing you‚Äôve got such great goals in life
---
I have a life
---
Do you plan starting a guild up at any point or playing just for leveling? I might not be on every single day, and will be leveling pretty casually taking breaks whenever. I dont want to hold you back or anything.
---
I really enjoy that compromise on the levels. It definitely feels like it would help mitigate the power creep.
---
Whether something is funny or not is subjective. I'd possibly have found them funny when I was eleven but all of the streamers I've had the misfortune to watch are not sources of wit.
---
Yeah granted that is a part of the reason why Myers-Briggs and other pseudo-ways of determining personality became so popular: it's practical to categorize. Problem is, personality is a bit more complex and non-binary than that. With that being said, hope we get some fun  results and I like the initiative!
---
I mean the most "veterans" who were mostly highschool or college students back during classic dont have multiple free evenings each week for a fixed raiding schedule. 
---
You may have that time, but plenty of us do not. It's just about how many responsibilities each one has. (Job, Family and all that stuff).
---
is it still 20g per stack in the classic WOW ? or that price only when there's stable raid groups going on ?
---
Though they are sources of something.
---
Im a orc hunter just FYI
---
You like to think you'll win but unless you are potting and using external items to get a step up, my frost trap gets resisted or something, more than likely rogues do not. Thats the good thing about vanilla, anyone can win if they play their cards right. 
---
I just know from my experience, rogues are the most enjoyable class for me to fight against because I have the highest chance of winning against them. When i see one, I feel like its an easy kill and most of the time it is, with them trying to run away after they see they cant engage me as easily as they thought. And even when they could, I can out damage low geared ones very easily especially with a pet with bestial wrath.
---
Shit, I'm implying they're sources of shit.
---
this video was made in 2006, damn straight it's good editing skills
---
This is like 20% leeway 80% lag
---
I played like this for years.
---
I'm doing the iron man challenge on retail until then
---
That's why I plan to tank 1-60 then go dps for raids.
---
Your calculations are correct. A big IF is IF they level as efficiently as Joana, and he took 7 actual days to play to 60. This is the guy who holds the world record. I doubt even 10% of players level as efficiently as he does, even *with* the guide.
---
 \[EU\] \[Alliance\] \[PVP realm\] I am looking for a dedicated leveling partner all the way to 60. I'm currently playing on a private server memorizing quests and guides (mostly Joana's leveling guide although it isn't finished for Alliance yet which is a bummer). Would also prefer someone to join me on this private server (or any for that matter) so we could practice until launch if possible. Still unsure about what I'm gonna be maining, open to many things, was a holy paladin main back in the days but not sure I wanna do the same again, tanking might be better for me as I like to take responsibilities and really don't like waiting for tanks too much. I'm planning to play 12+ hours a day for the first week for sure, would prefer someone who is free to do the same and we could have the same sleeping schedule, etc. Not aiming for first 60 or anything too serious but I'd like to min-max as much as possible so we can start our adventure at 60 faster.
---
Let me know here or in private message. Thanks!
---
Melodramatic. At most a C&amp;D.
---
Its just sharding on a grander scale. My assumption would be its an automated system and server pops hit x so it merged to = y.
---
That's just one of the many points. So is having had everything fresh as an experience, the first time is always fantastic - once you repeat that kind of experience 50 times it obviously stops being fun. There's also the inaccessibility, everything was difficult to achieve or very risky. Everything was unknown, you'd adventure into really unknown lands or stories or experiences. The leveling to 60 was **the** journey, that was the main content - you could die at lvl 5 just as you could die at lvl 59 - it was only after 60 and getting gear that you could kill the outdoor mobs easier, but at that time noone had a reason anymore to do outdoor content.
---
I will be honest.. This Helmet (bottom) looks for me like a fucking GOD Helmet which totally fits for a warrior. And makes the "Warrior"-Gear typical for a warrior. Damn why did this Gear went all over the place after TBC?
---
If you like this, and stop subbing at one point.
---
The F2P retail community is much like this. You are capped at lvl 20 but that doesn't stop you from having an endgame.
---
B-but No ChAnGeS!!!! The spirit of vanilla!!!! /s
---
Wasn‚Äôt Legion wildly successful? I don‚Äôt know if I bout the idea that WoW is dead considering it‚Äôs still crazy popular. They tend to have bad expansions and BfA is one of them.
---
That doesn't mean that damage taken is correct. Even if they had every mob damage completely correct, it doesn't guarantee anything.
---
There are calculations being made by the game that could be wrong since it's based on the legion client. Many bugs have already been reported that modify damage, health regen, and so on.
---
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP OMG. Should haved looked into it lmao, good catch man ! Those details count for sure, hope they fix this one !
---
&gt; My actual, extreme solution? Every ‚Äúexpansion‚Äù must be its own, integral, separate game, with its own complete, cohesive, holistic, 1-60 experience.
---
But then once every new "expansion" comes out everyone will flock to it, leaving the previous version emptier. And because of the seperation between the two, there's no reason to go back to the old game for players effectively killing that version. In essence, every Expansion would just be a sequel killing off the previous versions popularity like how the Newest CoD or Battlefield game or FIFA game kills off the audience for the previous version.
---
I think it might still be more enjoyable than playing with tryhards who "figured the game out" on private servers.
---
&gt; That makes the people claiming the data is wrong like 0 wins and 19 losses at this point.
---
The losers here are us who have to play with these shit values.
---
This is one of the less accurate MBTI "tests". It doesn't actually look at cognitive functions but categorizes based on the letters.
---
That and line of sight. Serously it's so annoying ranged and spells can be casted when i'm hugging a wall/pillar/tree.
---
Tanks are scarce in ALL MMO's.
---
It's not a matter of game design, or class design (look at BFA, there are like what, 6 tanking classes?). It is a matter of player mentality.
---
Since there aren't many true men in gaming...well, ofc there won't be enough tanks.
---
Classic, or whatever game you want.
---
Rogue as melee? Warlock as range? eehhmmm, what?  
---
1k - 2k seems a bit high, where do you have these numbers from?  
---
Some guy made this Youtube clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wciSPO9zg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wciSPO9zg)
---
Mind you, he took values from pservers, so there are some issues with that.
---
From what I remember from vanilla, my mage average somewhere around 800dps by the end of vanilla (probably in BWL with fire spec). But, I dont remember what gear I had at that time.  
---
AQ40 and Naxx DPS bumps significantly, since you get higher skill ranks.
---
No it's clearly not working as intended and is most likely being worked on which is why we have these tests.
---
I played ret in vanilla, it's super gear dependent but I had fun with it.  I just farmed gold/thorium, made an Arcanite Reaper and a Lionsheart helm, then filled out slots with rep gear from PVP and rank PVP rewards. 
---
 Raiding was another story, my guild would only allow me to be a buff bitch/MT heal spammer.  Eventually I was able to get some of the gear warriors didn't need anymore but hopefully with Classic servers coming people will give rets a chance because it's my favorite spec.
---
"Counterspell? Who needs is, it doesn't do any damage, it's useless!"
---
Take a good look around the comment sections of this sub. It‚Äôs full of spiteful insults and immature rage fits directed at things that don‚Äôt really matter. It‚Äôs a pretty toxic place, tbh. I‚Äôm just here to see if anyone got a beta invite.
---
Why would you even trust blizz? Remember when ppl were outraged they were going to shard the 1 to 10 zones and they responded by sharding the whole game? Pepridge farms remebers.
---
Ill try to answer to the best of my ability, but ive never played a 60 warrior (rogue main), so my answers might be wrong in certain aspects.   
---
1. That is up to you, if you want to tank a Shield + 1h is needed, defense gear wont really matter untill closer to 60, and stamina tend to be abundant on mail/plate.  
---
2. No. That also is up to you, if you let the group leader know you want to dps, fury warriors are quite great and usually is brought.  
---
3. Id say priest, just because you dont have too many ways of staying alive during combat as a warrior. A mage will usually kill mobs faster, but will also run out of mana faster, and end up drinking a tad more.   
---
4. Not really sure. Keyboard turning and clicking, but that is bad for any class :P  
---
5. Stance Dancing is usually just to make use of certain abilities you cant use in other stances. For example a fear is incoming, you swap to zerker stance and pop your anti-fear thingie. Enemy dodges, you jump into battle stance to use overpower. If you are about to die you equip your shield and 1h, hop into defensive stance and pop your shield wall. Stuff like that.  
---
6. If you plan to tank, you want to spend most of your time in defensive stance. As a fury dps though you really wont need defensive stance a whole lot. If you can predict massive incoming damage you can swap to defstance and pop your shieldwall, but in most cases (if you are dpsing) you will stay in zerker stance.  
---
7. Warriors are among the best dps and are quite sought after, but like you pointed out, it is among the most played classes aswell, so there will be quite a few of you (but if a warrior is what you want to play, the amount of other players playing it really shouldnt stop you, i encourage you to play whatever class you think you would like).  
---
I dont really know if you will have a hard time finding raid spots, but ive played Rogue on a couple of servers, and despite there being a lot of us i never had a lot of trouble finding guilds/raid spots.  
---
8. If you have a healer you can demolish most classes, the issue with warriors when alone is the fact that they are amazingly easy to kite. Mages and Rogues i know for sure should beat most warriors in a straight up 1v1, hunters might have an easy time aswell. Theoretically druids shouldnt have too hard of a time either, althought ive not witnessed many war/dru fights. Also not sure about shadowpriests, but they tend to beat most classes.  
---
Warlocks also might be a tough nut to crack with their double voidwalker sacrifice. Shamans are strong, but they are easier to stick too, so not too sure about that matchup. 
---
But this is all 1v1 scenarios, in a BG warriors tend to top the charts.   
---
As for gear you usually stay away from tanking items in PvP, stick to what makes you deal the most damage.  
---
Except maybe a shield+1h in the bag, for some shieldwall shenanigans.
---
I wonder how well using the rotating servers would work.  Like there are X classic servers, and a couple years from now, after they notice that their player counts for Classic are starting to stagnate or even drop, they transition the classic servers to TBC, while opening another set of classic servers.
---
It'd be a little weird if they opened a set of servers for TBC or even Wrath, and you had to race from 1-70 or 1-80 to get to endgame content.
---
So beta
---
Me and my RL friends all played WoW, we were all different levels varying from level 25-60. We lanned a few times, raiding Ashenvale as a group and stuff. We had loads of fun, even as a higher level in low level zones.
---
Its cause you destroyed it during the fight.
---
Well it might doesnt sound fun (for you) but it is for some people, maybe even a personal challenge. tbh I'm so stressed for any reason until I have my first char on max level but I also go off the way to do other things or do a dungeon but I couldnt wait to level for anyone. That's what I have alts for.  
---
like you say, to each their own. The game has a lot to offer while leveling, I will enjoy them more on my alts.
---
Maybe, but there are plenty of TBC and WotLK non-official servers that have decently healthy populations. You only need a few thousand people to have a thriving community.
---
what does TPS stand for?
---
&gt;Taliesen
---
 Taliesen was my biggest shock in that list - but glad he has come across
---
I still can't decide if Classic is going to break records for populations or be a total bust. I want it to be successful but I think most of the current hype is purely from streamers.
---
Yet somehow that doesn‚Äôt stop the small army of people seizing on this stuff to say ‚Äúlayering is sharding just renamed wake up sheeple‚Äù
---
Except that won't be possible, since if classic won't have the FOCUS unit identifier, then you won't have any legal way of storing and retargeting your intended focus. The closest you could get is try to target a nearby unit with the same name - which would have its usability limited, though often times you want to focus a
---
* player (unique name, also possibly identifiable through party/raid unitID)
---
* uniquely named boss
---
* dangerous mob that's not uniquely named, but only has one per pull
---
and in these cases the add-on could come in handy, especially if it reacts to combat events such as that unit starting a cast or similar.
---
Well for (1), all load balancing uses rate of change equations, not limits, so unless a specific subset divided across layers plays indefinitely along that time, you wont have an issue. And if they do, who cares, they‚Äôre on a dead layer at 4am in their time zone because the playerbase is actually dead. 
---
For (2), once server pops stabilize they can just apply virtual resources to higher pop servers. Layering is for dynamic resource allocation, you would never apply it to static resource needs anyways.
---
Good pile, Lord of the Clans is my personal favourite Warcraft  novel, which is due for a re-read before Classic is here :)
---
That would probably work quite well for levelling actually, but it wouldn‚Äôt fix issues for end game content like raids etc
---
The way she rested her cig hand on the mouse reminded me so much of my mom when she played games lol. 
---
Was so happy for this woman who dinged 60!
---
I think the streamer hate stems from envy. There are soooo many would-be vanilla streamers out there, sitting there live playing private servers with 0 viewers day in, day out. They wish they had what Asmongold has, so they despise him for his success. 
---
That's my theory, anyway. Why would anyone with purpose in life give two shits about streamers?
---
Any chance you're looking for a leveling partner?
---
It's not so much the streamers who're annoying but their entourage. The numerous hangers on following them around and bending over backwards to assist and sometimes carry them that I find irksome.
---
Definitely going to be avoiding them like the plague come August.
---
Here's the thing, there's no money to be made in the audience that wants open world sandbox mmos. They were already unpopular by the time WoW vanilla came out which is WHY Vanilla was such a hit.
---
The MMO genre is nich, sandbox is even more niche.  Today's market has so many options for games that are a lot of fun and don't require immense time sinks, it's not an environment for these old style mmos to succeed. Add to that challenge the cost of developing an mmo which is huge and requires a big commitment.
---
What I will do this time.. I will group with 5 players and keep questing with 5 players. Even tho if I miss XP but leveling alone is boring compared to leveling in a group if all of them are using TS3/Discord. Did this when Nost. Started and had so much fun and makes the leveling even more enjoyable because you are not thinking about: Damn 55 lvls to go no... You reach somehow lvl 20 and you wunder.. wow how did this happen?
---
Very good point ye, maybe the player base is healthy enough to be split 3/4 times and still survive, especially on larger servers but it may lead to server merges or something like that which weren‚Äôt received too well last time!
---
Keep in mind, Warriors are highly gear dependent, and each fight can vary quite a bit depending on how long anyone can be in melee range or even be allowed to consistently hit something. 
---
Generally speaking, top raid DPS is Warriors &gt; Rogues(generally a super close second) &gt; Mage &gt; Warlock &gt; Hunter when it comes to DPS; especially if we base this off of AQ. Overall Hunters do not scale well in the longrun, and Warlocks scale poorly until after BWL i believe. I've only just been looking at all of this too, and damn I am never playing a Hunter ever again. I was a great hunter, but I never realized how much their damage is just mediocre. 
---
Look for a dude named "Tips" on Youtube. He has great videos on this and very straight forward.
---
Don't forget the Cloth Hoods every warrior ran around in until their late 30's.
---
King Bangalash in Strangletorn Vale , North West on some kind of mound/mesa , a bit south of the raptor area
---
Broken Tooth near Uldaman entrance usually but can be seen roaming nearby
---
Precisely. If classic ends up just going tbc and then wrath, which I genuinely hope it doesn‚Äôt, people are in for a rude awakening. I love wrath, I did, had the greatest times and still play with friends I met then, meeting them regularly irl even, but it was the beginning of the end of wow being a a genuine mmo-rpg - today it‚Äôs more of an action game q-hub session daily grind
---
ASMONGOLD FINISHES INSTANCE RUN THAT ALL OF US HAVE DONE MULTIPLE TIMES: 500 upvotes
---
Look at this game destroying bug I found: 15 upvotes
---
If you read from the newest to the oldest, you can play retcon bingo while you're at it!
---
Blizz already confirmed it's a bug, your wish is granted!
---
That would definitely work for each game/expansion on its own. But you would end up splitting the player base into smaller parts with each expansion. Some will decide they prefer staying at max level and grinding the current expansion, others will move on. 
---
If you make it a forced transfer and make everyone level back up from 1, you're essentially removing all previous content, thus making sure that new players never get to experience it. Or do I interpret your solution differently?
---
1.
---
While leveling you want to be playing 2hand fury or 2hand arms. But yes, you should always carry a 1hander+shield that you got from quest/drop/dungeon, in case you have to tank. While leveling you shouldn't worry about other item slots, but at 60, maybe you want to keep a couple of tank items on you just to make tanking dungeons easier.
---
2. If you join a group that doesn't have a tank people will definitely ask of you to tank if you can. It doesn't require much so it's kinda expected that fury warriors are also able to tank dungeons.
---
3. Duo with healers is great. There's not much synergy to be had with a mage.
---
4. Going fury. Arms is just better. Not hamstring kiting mobs is a big one too, it's a massive difference, I suggest you try look up some videos on it. For dungeons the biggest thing that seperates tanks is proper use of taunt, getting full aggro on all mobs is near impossible, so you get the dps tank the main mob a bit until you got control of the others, then taunt the main mob. As a dungeon tank you don't have to have 100% control of all mobs. And of course it's all about confidence and knowing your and your healers limits.
---
5. Stance dancing is something that is talked about a lot but it's not big deal. You have 3 stances, some abilities can only be used in 1 (or 2) of your stances. So if you are tanking a mob in defense stance, and you want to use mocking blow as an extra taunt(they can resist), then you quickly go to battle stance, cast mocking blow, then go back to defensive stance. That is it really.  Or as a dps warrior in berserker stance you get a overpower proc, then you go to battle stance, cast overpower, then go back.  That's really just the jist of it. It's not all that difficult.
---
6. As dps then you won't use defensive stance unless if you have to suddenly tank something. A good dps has keybind to put on sword+shield (weapons can be changed in combat), and ready to suddenly tank something if needed. As for tanking, there's not much point to sit in berserker stance, 3% crit vs 10% more damage taken is a bad trade, and defensive stance gives extra flat out threat. So typically when you tank you want to sit defensive stance, but of course like I talked about, if you need to use an ability or two from another stance, then you "stancedance".
---
7. Warrior are definitely the most played class, but also the class with most raid spots. It's not uncommon for warriors to fill up to 10 out 40 spots in a raid. As for dungeons well tanks are always in demand, and typically you gain your dps gear by tanking dungeons, and sometimes reserving the items you need if you can.
---
8. Fury is very weak in pvp, you really wanna go arms here. Warriors are the weakest duelist in the game, so unless if you are well prepared to fight, you won't have a good time. Do keep in mind that preparation is the most important thing, so if you are an engineer pvp geared arms warrior who knows the matchups, you will still be able to destroy anyone.. who isn't engineer geared pvp specced class. As for what gear you wear, something in between dps and tank gear. You want high stamina plate gear with dps stats.
---
You keep the layers balanced as players log in based on server/faction population. After that players will organically swap layers with whoever they group with.
---
There's no way to avoid someone logging on to an almost empty layer at some point (that will be populated as subsequent players log in), but that's better than switching people mid combat.
---
For (1) you're suggesting to just stop adding people to a layer once there is no need for it? And then just let the people on that layer play it out? So they just have infinite resources, nodes, mobs? People are gonna never logout if that's the case, you get free mobs and rares just handed to you.
---
I don't undestand what you mean for (2). You agree that you would need layers indefinitely if the population for that server never goes down below 3k or whatever the server pop is, right?
---
What's even worse is those in New will typically only upvote streamer content, memes, bug issues, or official announcements. Most other discussion is down voted into oblivion.
---
The flaw here is thinking you need to keep raising the level cap.
---
This leads to perpetual player growth; eventually we become too powerful for the game, the grind to level cap becomes too steep and needs to be made gentler, the grind to gear up becomes too much and there needs to be catchups.  That is where we are.
---
I believe after 15 years the paradigm needs to be rethought.  The entire leveling paradigm should either be thrown out or capped off.  Imagine if classic is wildly popular, but they *never raise the level cap*.
---
The "alternate advancement" exists right now in BfA.  It's called the Heart of Azeroth (and tbh new Reputations are another grind).  You grind out 50, maybe 75 levels by the time 8.2 is done, and they take it all away from you at the end of the expansion, zeroing your AP and introducing a whole new set of Reputations for you to grind.
---
It's exactly like a Diablo season.
---
Without levels increasing forever, there's no need for new talent tiers, only reworks of existing trees.  Without new levels there's no need to make leveling faster because there's more of it.  There's no need to prune new skills that have built up over the years.
---
Stop cultivating, and start harvesting!
---
There are a few in that stack I actually haven't read yet.  But, I suppose now is the time to do it!  I am nearing the end of *Durotan*, which I have been enjoying a lot.  I got it on audiobook, which has made my daily commute feel much shorter than it is, lol.
---
Seems there is an issue with my wording. Thank you for pointing that out to me.
---
It decreases damage to save rage. You wanna cash in on the 600 base damage of execute as many times as possible - the extra rage is just a bonus.
---
I would like to filter out surveys and streamers please.
---
I just can‚Äôt....why so much knob-skinning for streamers? People complain because this is a classic wow discussion board, not a neck beard streamer highlight reel. We share in the questioning of what kind of sub this is. Is this really that bad?
---
I did it cause I dont really loose sleep over 12 euro and if it happens it happens.
---
8. Literally all the classes you described can beat warriors
---
Mages, hunters, druid, priests, pally, shaman (i played one, i can beat warrior).  All can beat warrior
---
The only ones warrior has a easy time against is warlock and rogue because they cant be feared and rogue will activate the overpower spell.
---
Ty so much!
---
Did it? I remember it saying "did some strange gestures at you" etc. if you were the opposite faction. I did start playing on my own in TBC tho and played vanilla only on my uncle's account so it may have been patched / fixed much later.
---
&gt; Meanwhile horde gets a large protected settlement in the middle of the map with roads leading to every section quickly.
---
This seems to be a general theme in many zones. The alliance often only gets a tent, a campfire, two quest NPCs and a fucking "good luck" pat on the back. Even when they do have more than the bare minimum, it's typically the less optimally placed for access. 
---
It doesn't have to be equal, but on a PVP server, it gives a huge advantage when it comes to being able to just take a damn breather or increase your chances to have to fight someone because you only travel in two directions while a central hub lets you leave in many.
---
Which of these would be most relevant for Classic?  Almost though the first of the WoW Chronicles series and looking for more to consume.  Seems like the next in the Chronicles series focuses more on TBC era stuff?
---
Ty!
---
No one can say until classic is out but in vanilla they always were quickly sold and most wanted, people didnt want to learn cooking or fishing they just want to grab some from the auctionhouse.
---
I used this back in 2005 to get my epic mount and riding skill and for all my raiding.
---
The easiest, most simple solution for that problem is to just keep layers (forever) for more populated servers, since as they said, they do not want to open/close actual servers.
---
Now this is interesting as a solution. Keep the max level the same, and give people options for endgame, which all require different gear. I'm sure there will still be a big bias towards the newly released expansion content, but there will probably still be nostalgia runs going on for latecomers.
---
Hope you don‚Äôt get a phone call.
---
What they base it on. It is very likely they will limit capabilities or we will have spell batched one click macros as sophisticated as bots playing for people.
---
Anyone have a PDF of the Bestiary?
---
If you don't have a static amount of layers you will need to create layers if too many people want to play. Then you will also need to destroy layers as population dips. So people will have to be phased in and out if they play during a time where the population is declining, such as evening time.
---
My druid is 19525/21000 revered. The stupid reputation just sits there mocking me and I can never get it to exalted
---
the irony of this comment
---
With how populated the beta is, I‚Äôd assume this is because of mobs spawning on top of people already in combat. At level 8 you don‚Äôt have the tools to 2v1 mobs yet.
---
Threat per second. Ie Agro
---
They plan on making it, so yes.
---
No major changes to the difficulty will occur between Beta and release.
---
You don't understand, they have the old client as reference to make sure it's correct, that the calculations are correct, they can access the code directly if needed. 
---
What don't you understand ? You want it to be wrong because you remember it being wrong welp guess what, memories aren't infaillibe, the data IS, the code IS.
---
Blizzard has all of these, you don't, private servers don't.
---
Throughout vanilla Free Action Potions are in demand and that's Blacmouth + stranglekelp you fish together. Firefin early on at best is for weaker fire protection pots, gets more value pre-aq due to greater firepower potion.
---
Greater sagefish and nightfin are always in demand, rumsey black label also. Plus eels, elemental water and alike. While leveling wreckage piles could be a good way to make money while semi-AFK.
---
Fishing + alchemy is quite nice.
---
Yea, why not. People to crazy about how the axe is the best, and while i dont disagree, its not like the sword is just trash in comparison, or that it takes way longer with it. I think aesthetics matter, and I also absolutely hate human warrior animations, yet i cant play anything but human. Wouldnt mind new animations toggle tbh
---
No, it still works like a track (can't have  track humanoids + track minerals) its functions correct, but is "misplaced?"
---
Check this thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bse7zo/a_command_that_maybe_should_not_be_in_classic/
---
Oh boy.. No they are not.
---
It sold for over 100g 15 years ago easily.
---
INTP-P logician... what class does that me?
---
threat per second
---
I loved GW1. To bits. GW2 was such a big disappointment for me because they removed the whole constant dungeons while leveling.   
---
But imo this doesn't quite solve the problem that most people flock to the newest expansions to keep the old content relevant though...
---
You are right but that graph further proves my point, every other expansion +2 million so they theorised +2 million more for cata but they only got a marginal increase, thus making launch actually decent.
---
Throw in Chronicles volume 1 and rise of the Horde while you are at it :D
---
A) A goblin sapper charge, only goblins can make but everyone can use. Does about 400-600 instant AOE damage, amazing for any cleave fight.
---
B) Iron grenades to interupt eye beams on Cthun, other bombs to throw doing your dps rotation
---
C) The ability to summon robo chicken as gnome, small dps increase but more important the chicken has a chance to yell out a battle cry that gives 5% haste to your group. 
---
D) Reflectors as resistance gear.
---
But mostly it's the sapper charge and chicken.
---
I had more fun doing pvp as a lvl2 rogue on the stress server than I have had on retail for a long time because the starting zone got invaded by a full raid of alliance. It was amazing having open world pvp like that, and rogue is op enough at that level to actually win some fights because crits hit insanely hard, so I actually got to participate fighting lvl5s. 
---
Retail has some neat mechanics, but the one server community, and real open world pvp, just doesn't exist the same way anymore.
---
Em we will see and remember dungeon difficulty is different from player power.
---
I'm a nameless adventurer on retail. I cant wait to be a named adventurer in classic.
---
My first sunken temple run a guy in my group said "we wont be able to kill this guy, I was in a group earlier with &lt;tradechat celebrity&gt; and we couldnt beat him"
---
We beat him, and this time I want people to say that about me. I cant wait until my name matters again
---
Lupos is nerfed i imagine. And brokentooth isnt as cut out as it is, simply because attack damage scales based on speed. So it will have low dmg but fast attack. 
---
I recommend wind serpent because of range spell damage. But brokentooth is definitely good vs casters. Great in bgs to disable healers
---
Retail = Casual
---
Classic = Older/Slower
---
Yep. I wish I could call Classic, Hardcore, but it just isn't FFXI or Everquest. Those were hardcore, and I'm sure there were some before those that were along the same lines or more hardcore.
---
&gt; Look at it strictly monetarily: Most players attracted to Classic are not currently playing Retail  
---
Caught me. :)
---
&gt; couldn't/shouldn't continue to release new content with a more "classic" state of mind. Right?! Am I nuts? 
---
Personally I'd be happy with it, but I know it won't happen nor happen correctly. It'd turn into Retail again, inevitably. When it came to the content, art, music, creative changes with quests, etc - It was amazing. When it came to mechanics and other shit.. not so much...
---
I don't know how this would be lucrative enough for Blizzard though.
---
I've been hearing a lot of buzz that if the Classic servers go well, they may think about BC or WotLK servers.
---
genius
---
the horde "leader" sonii legit was spamming "if u get agro die" so he basically made it reset. He is an incredible cringey person, and seems like the only content he comes up with is in the wake of asmongolds. Pretty lame if u ask me
---
But there are bugs that Blizzard have confirmed that do mess with damage taken values. Like the stoneskin bug. They obviously had the data for how stoneskin should work, but it didn't work correctly.
---
All i'm saying is that if a large group of people are saying "this seems off" in a BETA test, then maybe it'd be worth to actually explain how we know it's right, especially as hundreds of other bugs are being discovered.
---
What do you mean fewer spells?
---
They did class revamps during classic changing entire talent tree's and adding spells. Nothing stopping them from improving/fixing specs through patches. I still remember when they did the paladin patch and I saw consecration for the first time, was glorious.
---
The leveling process for Priests is almost the same for each spec. You main goals are little downtime and consistend killing of mobs. The two most important talents at the start are 5/5 Wand Specialization (Disc tree) and 5/5 Spirit Tap (Shadow tree). 
---
Shadow still makes it faster due to the Improved Shadow Word: Pain talent and Mind Flay. Most mobs will be pulled with Mind Blast followed by casting Shadow Word: Pain. You can then start to Wand the mob down or throw in a Mind Flay before starting to wand.   
---
For mobs with more HP you might want to repeat the Mind Flay or cast a second Mind Blast later and refresh the Shadow Word: Pain if it runs out and the mob is still far from dieing. 
---
Once you hit level 40 you will respec at the trainer to gain Shadow form. Afterwards you want to get Wand Specialization again because wand will be your main source of damage all the way to 60 to consume mana coupled with Spirit Tap for improved mana generation after each kill.
---
By a specific API function that checks whether someone is in range or not.
---
&gt; This addOn automatically scans for any targetable units of your choice by name and alerts you upon finding one. Instead of the modern scanning methods which don't work for Vanilla it uses the API function TargetByName which was removed with TBC.

What was your fishing skill level in this screenshot? Curious because you're still getting glancing blows
---
sick burn
---
You can host it on a free hosting jpeg/png website
---
then I assume you've never been in a decent raiding guild who could clear the current raid in a day.
---
Not to worry, people were complete trash skill-wise in 2004.
---
1.  Yes you need to be ready to tank if you play warrior, you can always use a /equip macro you can swap weapons in combat, but not other equiped items.  
---
2. No not always, but expect to tank, its the cost of playing warrior.  
---
3. Its very fun to play with a healer as warrior. But anything works.
---
4. Taunting a mob that you have aggro on, this always annoy me when tanks do.
---
5. Stance Dancing is when you swap stances back and forth, you use it as all types of warriors. There is macro's to help you.
---
6. yes ofc, if you need to tank something. you do it in protstance
---
7. Fury Warrior's are among the top of dps. so yeah, they are in high demand. But when it comes to instances, you tank your own instance, most warrior tanks dont like to invite more warriors.
---
8. Mage if they get to start Hunter,Warlock. The Thing is, as a Warrior solo. You need skill or you die time after time. But bring Warrior+Healer and you are a wrecking machine.
---
6-7k soulfire crits in vanilla? Nope
---
They already invited all beta testers. So it's just pointless.
---
Let's see, I think I still have some Really Sticky Glue (stack of 5 or something that will immobilize target) and a Mechanical Yeti (3 charge item robot-like item). Those both seem worth keeping and apparently NEVER USING. \*sigh\* I really need to clean out my bank someday... 
---
I believe those are both classic items, but I have no idea where they came from now.  The glue has probably broken down and with no maintenence performed on the yeti it probably won't even start up.
---
I also have my Mithril Insignia (blacksmithing questline) to show that I aparently had no better things to do than track down and smelt like 160 mithril ore/bars.
---
Yeah, compared to my vanilla experience it seemed reasonable though. Since I actually knew what I was doing later.
---
What class resonates with you the most in classic
---
Wasn't LFD added in 3.3.0 in WoTLK, it was right at the end of the expansion so it can't be the reason for easier dungeons. Original LFD wasn't cross server and was added in BC AFAIK.
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dungeon\_Finder](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dungeon_Finder)
---
Maybe our definitions of "difficult" are different, because that doesn't sound difficult to me at all, its just a simple gear/luck check. Missed twice: reset, otherwise: drink and continue.
---
I removed "attack" from my action bar and then opened my inventory and dragged my rifle onto my action bar and couldn't figure out how to fight things. 
---
So I just deleted my character and started over.
---
Is it so fucking hard to understand that most classic wow content people get are from streamers playing the game?
---
Yeah you don't hate, sorry. But negative attitude is clearly visible. I don't care about streamer but i don't mind them. They bring more attention to classic so that's good. As for Youtube.... yeah asmongold reaction videos spam is annoying.
---
My point is...maybe we should ignore them? Lets ignore them and lets discuss classic instead as we should. :)
---
Not totally true, there are some text with it: ¬´¬†World first¬†¬ª. /S
---
Yeah easy the program will do all the work
---
Imagine if they did a fresh server with later expansion content retuned for 60.
---
A reverse timewalking, if you will.
---
I would pay the monthly sub to play beta, no more.
---
And no I did not pay the monthly sub for the chance to play beta.
---
I see your point of view is not as bad as it seems. but if it gets worse then yeah... maybe mods should regulate that.
---
Wonder how long until this one is locked as well. Come on man, no one is going to take it seriously if you spam the shit out of the sub.
---
the best part is that hardly anyone on retail think of classic, now that the initial week/ 2 week of beta access exclusivity has died down.
---
but every other post on this subreddit compare beta with retail...
---
Downvoted because alliance scum ...
---
true to that.
---
SHARTING DansGame
---
Yep, with ~550 SP, ZG trinket, CoE, and PI.
---
You had to also spec 10% fire dmg in destro, and 15% fire dmg from sacrificing Imp.
---
I think you should add a question about the role, you will take. (Tank/Heal/DPS)  
---
Because I would like to play Pala but I prefer to be a proper Tank, so only Warrior is viable.
---
His Hearthstone content is great. He never gets angry and is pretty funny too
---
**For solo leveling** I always like the carrion birds and owls,  I used Vultros from west fall (It's blue)  Carrion birds eat fish and meat, Owls only eat meat.
---
so Fishing (which I do a ton of anyway, is a great way to feed the pet for no cost, just feed it the crap fish you get when your fishing for targetted money fish.) and meat is ready available everywhere.
---
you Screech is an AE damage + debuff, so it's helps the pet get initial multi target aggro.
---
Claw is a handy focus dump, and dive is like dash for cats.
---
**For groups**, I always liked cats,  Tanks tend to complain about the noise from screech, and some git really upset about a big bird in their camera.
---
**For Night elves.** I like cats, the shadow meld + cat prowl, is helpful when defending the flag room.  It's also handy when you ninja rezz, summon pet, eat drink and shadow meld out.   however if your being camped, you may need to just do eat drink meld, and wait until you've recovered before risking summoning the pet.
---
**regarding attack speed.**  the super fast attack speed is really only helpful when attacking casters, for more interrupts.  However any pet with claw, isn't far behind.
---
No it's not :(
---
I have only had this happen to me once while leveling in Silver Pine forest. While doing "Arugal's Folly" quest, I was outside of the mine when I was phased. The area was nearly clear when all of a sudden, every enemy respawned instantly along with another player. Of course this behavior is unintended and I promptly reported the issue.
---
There is another area on the map where you can force phasing to occur, it's right outside of RFK entrance. There are a couple enemy right outside the portal, and you can make them despawn and respawn by walking near the entrance and backing up again. I also reported this of course but it's the only areas that I noticed where I can force the game to phase/layer.
---
pretty sure this pic is from a private server, since somebody is looking for a BRD run
---
Was the bestiary ever changed? As in the values, its from 2008. The damage values are just so depressingly low.
---
Most actual discussion here is trash
---
hilarious +1
---
What could it be on my end if my world and home latency are 60/61 and my internet speedtests at 200+mbps? This is hands down the best numbers I‚Äôve ever had while playing WoW and never experienced any sort of game lag this bad without having high latency from a poor connection? If it‚Äôs on my end I‚Äôm genuinely stumped

that's because BRD is a unique case where 3 dungeon were slapped in one. you also make forming group appear way harder than it was, especially for a popular one like BRD.

I also love how you didn't mention M+, the newest system who make the 5-man game of previous expansion look stale and boring... but I suppose vanilla fanatics only claim to want challenging 5 man, they don't actually do them.

I expect Classic to be a bit of a wake up call for Blizzard. I'm expecting future expansions to have more of the classic focuses that people love and miss. The amount of people that want to enjoy exploring an mmo instead of hitting the autoqueue loot pinata is pretty apparent now.
---
As for Classic, I am hoping that they turn Classic into a seasonal server type of thing. Schedule content release through the expansions and keep fresh servers rolling out as Vanilla rolls over to TBC, and TBC rolls over to Wrath. As weird as it may sound, I would really like some kind of diablo hardcore mode too. Something along the lines where if you die, you are dead for the week with a small dick punch quest of coming back to life(Getting your spirit back to SW cathedral or something along those lines).
---
TLDR: Not sure what content you are looking for, but I feel like quest/zones/dungeons should be going to retail with enhancements to improve Classic longevity going to Classic.
---
&gt; While leveling its really good though. Since the mob will most likely be dead by the time you get to 3 sunders it's more time efficient to just do more damage for your group while still holding aggro.
---
1 sunder/revenge is usually enough for each mob until people kill the main target. 
---
&gt;Shoot the mobs, bloodrage while they run to you (rage generation gives threat), battle shout (also gives threat, though apparently only on initial application in beta) then that should be enough for them to stick on you through the first heal/wave of their attacks which should give you a revenge proc and enough to start doing whatever.
---
But I don't have bloodrage up for every pull. Demo/battle shout usually does the trick, but when I don't have bloodrage up it gets a bit tricky keeping aggro for long. 
---
&gt;Its not as rage inefficient as you think since a lot of your white attacks miss anyways in dungeons where the mobs are higher than you, so that white attack you think you're missing out on to generate more rage actually had a pretty low chance to even happen with miss chance/dodge/parry/etc. Most of your rage is gonna come from the damage you take in low level dungeons, not the damage you deal.
---
That's a good point. I will definitely try some more cleave spamming when classic hits. I'm just not sure it's as clear cut, especially when you are not playing with a very coordinated group.

Its there for everyone, just for a gold cost. Get to farming the gold for it.
---
As a Warrior, i have mixxed feelings, when i pvp i need to respecc when i pve i need to specc back. But i think they should be in the game. Its creates players beeing more unique in their speccs, instead of everyone feeling like a hybrid that can do multiple things, when they should not be able to.
---
Also true!
---
The stoneskin bug is independant of the calculation and data, it's a functionnality brought back in the current code that had an unintended bug and has been fixed or is being fixed. It's not the calculations that are flawed it's a spell effect continuing when it should be off which an easy bug to happen (unintended state staying despite technically being changed back).
---
So again, irrelevant. An argument could be made that devotion aura has a similar bug possibly but it has been shown to not be the case yet. The calculations are correct though and the damage values are correct.
---
Dude I ran to the ironforge airbase with a few fandom strangers and we had a great time. I haven‚Äôt met anyone outside my guild and talked to them in retail in forever. And that‚Äôs not even getting to all the GM shenanigans that happened
---
If you don't want to make it just publish the data, I think someone will do it pretty easily
---
Barrens are a horde zone, if you're horde you're not flagged there.
---
Hell no. Respec costs = more time played overall for everybody that needs them. That's more time spent in the game, interacting with the world and potentially other people.
---
For **beta** I personally think they should've made it free, since it's only there for testing.
---
Super popular servers existed in Vanilla too, If the pop cap was reached you had to wait in queue.
---
I would rather go with horizontal leveling. All expansions could be max level, and synergy of class abilities would come from item sets, each expansion introducing a new set. The set would tie into the build / fantasy you are playing.
---
Ahh drop rate changed, yeah looks a nice item to get. 0.1% chance to drop.
---
Well... no.
---
Look, I'm not a huge fan of BFA.  And I'm looking forward to Classic.  But the first problem here is you're making a huge, sweeping observation based on small numbers and a very short time period.
---
We've already seen people turn to trying to do shenanigans like hack the game (not literally hack), get into stuff higher level than they're "intended" to take on, sneak into places they shouldn't, pull high level mobs into cities... basically most of that stuff isn't part of playing the game normally.  Sure, you can do it.  And you can do things like that in BFA.
---
Right now you're seeing people either experience something they haven't before, or reliving nostalgia.  And they've still run out of things to do, and to keep people interested and hyped, they're having to make up content.  Granted, it shouldn't be as bad at max level (though eventually they'll run out).
---
BFA can't compete with that, because it's not got the freshness of being "new" (a lot of people have been playing WoW with the current trend of skills, talents, etc. for years), and it's too new to trigger nostalgia (heck, even MoP and WoD are starting to trigger nostalgia), and people choose to spend their time on forums saying they don't enjoy playing it rather than finding shenanigans to get involved in or random stuff to do.  Hey, fair enough if people want to complain.  I complain as well.  But if someone instead takes that time and tries to find secrets in the world, or runs transmogs, or tries to level up level 80 characters and gear them with friends to try to down Algalon for the special achievement, they could be having a lot of fun in BFA, the same way people are having fun in Classic.
---
And, again, it's just a week or two in.  That's it.
---
Can we please stop with the "BFA vs Classic," especially when it's a poor comparison like this?
---
I think I remember being able to 'push' mobs like this video. Tanks used to do it so they could move a boss back a little way without changing its facing.
---
Maybe I am wrong.
---
I think I do, actually, know what I'm talking about here. It seems to me you are jumping to conclusions and closing your mind to alternatives, both in terms of alternative interpretations of the problem and alternative solutions to it. 
---
The problem with WoW's economy is that it wants to have its cake and eat it. The currency appears to be commodity money, gold, silver, and copper, acquired directly through labour. Fine. But it really behaves like capital -- a logically infinite fund of potential wealth the value of which is fixed entirely by market forces. There is no limit to the amount of "gold" which can be in the game at any one time. It's therefore not really commodity money at all, is it. This is not how gold behaves. Commodity money changes in value over time as the coinage degrades, it is expensive and difficult to carry around and to keep hold of. Its value is not only affected by market forces. In reality it's not how capital behaves either -- and the systems by which the amount of capital in circulation increases and decreases, which is fundamentally dependent on the lending power of banks and other legal and macroeconomic factors, simply don't exist in the game world.  
---
This is a basic contradiction which the game has never had any answer to. As you say, people are amassing what are effectively paper fortunes, the value of which is determined almost purely by the market; but those paper fortunes exist as hoards of commodity money with a logically impossible stable 1-1 equivalence with their market value as capital. Commodity money and capital have never had this kind of relationship in reality. It becomes hard to use economic arguments to make sense of a system that behaves in this way, because the factors which create economic reality beyond the most simplistic mechanisms of supply and demand don't exist.  
---
This is more like a system in which people can trade their game scores, rather than anything resembling money. This seems to me obviously something that's anticompetitive and antifun, right from the getgo. That's why it's more about creating game systems which avoid the game situation I described -- the existence of seperate castes of players who no longer need to interact with eachother in mutually enriching and positive ways -- rather than ones that ultimately just perpetuate the situation by trying to manipulate supply and demand through introducing a supply of luxury commodities to the marketplace. Without implementing a more realistic economic model, where commodity money behaves like commodity money in the real world, i.e. it depreciates over time as the quality of the metals reduces in circulation, and has associated costs and risks in storing it, the contradictions in the way the WoW "economy" works can likely only be resolved for Classic by currency resets -- whether in the form of endgame leagues or seasons, which is probably the way they will go, or by some kind of rolling system that keeps a lid on runaway inflation by actually decreasing the amount of gold players have through taxation or simulating money depreciation. Classic is unique in that there won't be new xpacs coming around to create the partial resets we get through the introduction of new goldsinks -- which in my view the very existence of which indicates a total failure to create a viable, fun and fair economic playing field in the game anyway. 
---
Personally I would prefer a game which tried to resolve those contradictions by limiting inflation through causing currency to actually grow less valuable the longer it is held by the player, in other words it would tick down in value toward zero, and larger hoards would lose value faster, though perhaps players could invest -- did you know this once referred to the practice of burying commodity money in the ground, "investing" silver as treasure buried in the earth? -- or otherwise protect their hoards at a cost. As in reality currency would have to be kept in circulation or risk losing its worth quite rapidly. This would begin to create actually interesting economic conditions in the game and prevent the imbalances which I foresee damaging the Classic community's development, just as they did first time around.
---
what rep grind?
---
Hydraxian waterlord? few hours of aoE'ing in silithius if you aren't getting it through MC.
---
Keeper of time, or w/e faction needed for the AQ40 scepter? that's one guy.
---
ZG / AQ20 / AQ 40 rep? you'll get them with your weekly clears, you aren't 'grinding' it.
---
and I seriously hope you aren't considering gold farming 'content' in classic wow...
---
Yeah, I was just joking a little bit, Im a hunter main too so I stumble on this stuff every now and then.
---
But it's a well known fact that hunters counter rogues.
---
Hunters mark, flare, serpent sting... the list goes on.
---
If the initial content cycle was completed before opening new servers there would likely be much less outrage.
---
Watch kargoz's class overview on youtube, then pick whatever seems the most fun.
---
Wont work in release, people will have enemy cast bars.
---
Thanks for the suggestions. I hadn‚Äôt launched wow since legion, maybe it‚Äôs a file issue. Might uninstall it all and start over tonight after work. Thanks for an actual suggestion and not just telling me it‚Äôs my fault with no insight as to what the issue might be. Cuz I‚Äôve never experienced this sort of input lag without having close to 1000 latency.
---
But obviously you can't just remove layers or you'd end up with the biggest queue in WoW history when you take a 4x layered server to have no layers overnight. It would be unplayable to a degree we've never seen.

literally how i do it. the only time when i didnt use scroll down for defensive ability was playing a death knight. scroll down would always be grip, makes so much sense to me
---
I never said they SHOULD change anything?
---
The actual deletion is the same one in both videos. For whatever that is worth
---
I don't know if there is any official information regarding this.
---
Depends on the raid, its hilarious when you get to four horsemen and your guild is scrambling all their fury warriors, trying to deck them out in SOME tank gear, cause you preferrably needed 8 (yes EIGHT) tanks for that encounter :')
---
They gotta walk and won‚Äôt have flight paths or even maps to guide them! Haha haha
---
Do not vendor mats from herb/mining. Maybe some of the really early on ones you can, since they sell for almost nothing, but don't vendor the more expensive mats. Just send them to a bank alt, they'll sit for 30 days and then get sent back and sit for another 30 days before being deleted. Just let the timer run out and bounce back, by then the server should start to have a bit of a stable economy and people will be trying to level crafting profs.
---
You can vendor skins though, they AH for garbage.
---
I know I shouldn't have, but I subbed when we got the announcement and got in on the first EU wave.  
---
Worth it.  
---
Not sure I would have subbed at this point though, having heard that the invites are gonna slow down drastically.  
---
But like u/SquidToph said, I'd also rather have won the actual lottery xD
---
I agree with most things, but I don't see any reason they can't mess around with talents/skills or add PvP content such as Arenas/RBG.
---
They routinely did class rework patches during vanilla so I see nothing wrong with them improving some of the specs and making them viable. It's not like vanilla is so perfectly balanced that they can't/shouldn't touch anything.
---
The Rank14 grind is also just not good pvp content. It's actually what I did back during vanilla. It was a long boring grind of stomping random players who wanted to pvp over and over in WSG/AB. There was nothing skillful or interesting about just 3 caping the flag or 5 caping AB with no resistance for 15 hours a day. some sort of RBG/Arena system with a goal to farm for would be great.
---
I came here for a debate on if Fury was really better without sit exploit since every "vanilla" guide you see leans heavily on it. In vanilla I was Arms until 60 then respec to prot to main tank in raids. Even back then it seemed all the rhetoric was that Fury was better for leveling. I had a pocket healer and did well enough, but was considering going Fury this time for freshness.
---
Seems like Fury might be better for solo grind but Arms has more utility if you want to do 5-mans. I would only ask all of those here who claim they have tested both--do you mean on pserver or classic beta? 
---
In any case this whole thread is making me smile because to me the sign of a well balanced MMO is when every class/spec is attractive and people will argue all day over the details.
---
It did on average, however back then I was raiding in a top end guild and pushing for rank 1 logs and it took me months before I finally received my bis legendary on my hunter. I was one of the unlucky one's to get every single one before receiving my bis, and it just felt horrid. Keep in mind I was literally doing everything possible, playing daily for usually 8+ hours.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
I found high end hookers work great for this problem
---
like i said, i rather play a different class than click. I havent clicked a spell in years.
---
It would be even cooler if Classic becomes a huge success and they consider adding content that was scrapped back then... like the Uldum raid in southern Tanaris, among other things.
---
But most Russians were on Warsong/Stonemaul/Shadowmoon back in the day. So if you didn't choose that particular realm you were OK. But I think we are getting a Russian tab just like in retail, all the content was translated back in TBC.
---
I'm straight up just going to level 2 different priests and two different warriors.
---
Depends on how its handled. They could go the GW2 route. Or they could perform a stat and level squish every expansion so it never goes beyond 70. Classic for 2-3 years -&gt; Level 70 expansion -&gt; Level squish and next level 70 expansion -&gt; etc
---
https://archive.org/details/ShaneMcConnellbzulbzfwmv
---
Lol, can't wait for ZF /s
---
Seriously, it will be boring AF playing through that difficulty. That looks like the lowest skilled group ever assembled for a Zul Farrak run and they make it. Mother of god that warrior is bad.
---
And that will go for a lot of people I would assume, streamers have already confessed to doing this in Vanilla originally, where there is a demand someone will supply.
---
True men and PvE?  
---
Top kek.
---
Thanks man I will do that
---
Considering 1-20 is a third of the available levels, I really doubt it.
---
MAYBE 1-10.
---
INFO
---
&gt;Do you feel it might take away some of the fun?
---
You give examples of why it "should" be changed but you never explained why it might take away fun for you
---
keep in mind this is low lvling dungeons. They were always faceroll, even as a complete noob back in 2005 we cleared deadmines and SM without problems. Level 60 dungeons are tuned quite a bit harder.
---
gah yeah i never noticed that text .. so full of contex .. /s
---
mE AcRoNymSsS
---
bwshahaha gl getting dft as hunter
---
There are ways to mitigate this though - like move only players who are afk or are on using a taxi, or who use teleport/portal. This way nobody would even notice the transitions.
---
Good warriors keep a tanking set handy even though their main role is pewpew anyways :p
---
Mate, that exploration bullshit was just a way to get plebs out of the starting zones on pservers. Level the ol' traditional way by hitting mobs
---
Druid.
---
Most definitely not. There has not been any official word about this yet though.
---
shut up boomer
---
That's a good point, starting with ICC earlier raids increasingly became optional for new raiders. You didn't HAVE to do Naxx or Ulduar to get ICC ready. And Cata turned it up to 11.
---
How can you split the player base, when the players aren't there for BFA?
---
Especially since hunters are pretty much busted on beta
---
Yeah , i saw the Asmongold streams promoted everywhere.. even on youtube where it is notorious .. asmongold ran away , asmongold sneezed , asmongold in SM , asmongol this that..
---
when i checked Overwatch it is always XQC this XQC that .. 
---
what a cancer
---
Apparently there's a turn-around for main tanks as well when you get good enough gear that fury becomes better than prot due to threat generation. Similar idea to replacing tank pieces with DPS gear to get more rage or whatever, but taken even further. 
---
No first hand experience with this though, only heard of guilds doing that.
---
Just watch Twitch. Apparently the difficulty was that easy back in the yo, it's a complete faceroll.
---
It‚Äôs a shame, because it‚Äôs very helpful to understand the context of a lvl 18 instance nobody ever saw like the Deadmines. /s
---
why wouldnt you be able to speak the language you want :P that would be really dumb. i see people talking French German English Czech on ravencrest Trade and general. i dont think it matters so much, its more like a convenience thing
---
We're discussing limiting streamer posts/clips, but haven't made a decision yet. *Please* report anything that is a literal repost (e.g., the exact same clip posted twice). We try to get to these manually but don't always catch them.
---
But he never passed through them. He was still in front of the mob but all up in they're personal space.
---
Warriors top dps untill aq. Then youll have one mage 1# with ignite and then 9 warriors
---
&gt; It's a necessary side effect from the way WoW does progression (strictly linear): Everything but what's at the top is obsolete.
---
Sure... but at the same time, you could choose to make something not "obsolete."  Try doing Algalon at 80 with appropriate gear, for example, or other raids at-level.  Run BGs.  Stuff like that.  It's basically what we're already seeing people do in WoW Classic.  Once 60 is available, they'll be playing endgame content, and eventually hit a point where there's no quests to send them into lower level dungeons, so they won't need to "mindlessly" clear old dungeons (pretty much what it'd be if a group of 60s go into Scarlet Monastery) anymore because there's no transmog so no reason to run them at all.  Most people won't want or have any need to do all of the reps in Classic, so their endgame will largely be either the raid scene or PVP.  What happens each phase when people clear the latest raid?  That's where we'll start to see how things really feel.
---
I could go mow lawns for a couple hours and make 15$. How long does it take to get enough gold to buy a token?
---
One of my favorite books is Tides of War it's great on audiobook in my opinion and it does a great job in displaying why Jaina "went mad".
---
I have a question to the community regarding prep.
---
Is there anyway, or any place I can predownload classic so that upon release I can just boot it up instead of waiting the 15 hours it will take to download and then install?
---
huh ? most classic wow content will be played by people who love the game , not by following random streamers whose aim is to get clicks and donations and views ...
---
What I meant is that almost every guild raid more than 1 raid. Not just the most recent. So for example BWL + MC. When you progress in a raid, a lot of the time people still need items on the previous tier. 
---
To say that there‚Äôs nothing to do in Vanilla is a joke.
---
Not the point. The idea is not to level efficiently or effectively, or even to reach level 60. The aim is to get as far as possible without killing a single mob or turning in a single quest.
---
It‚Äôs not, this was not possible in vanilla
---
I didn't know they were able to transfer internet data over morse code.
---
&gt;Taking the Ony Neck instead of the tanking Trinket. /facepalm
---
This is not correct - take the neck. The tank meta has changed drastically. If your MT is wearing full prot gear, you're raid will struggle with DPS and threat.
---
I'd rather see clips of interesting events, whether it's a popular streamer or not, than low effort and repetitive meme's but maybe that's just me.
---
Besides, the community here get's to decide what we see on the front page anyhow, and if streamer clips get upvoted(or even those low effort memes) you'll have to live with the fact that not everyone agree's with you and that this place is made up of many different type of people who prefer a wide variety of content.
---
keep in mind this is low level leveling dungeons. They were always faceroll, even back in 2005 while having 10 fps, being clickers and having no clue about anything we cleared these dungeons with no problems. Level 60 dungeons are definitely tuned harder, though they'll still be relatively easy for todays players.
---
Even Ferals can pull of more DPS then hunters. Because the Progress is less impact-full compared to hybrid-Classes. Hybrid-Classes started to shine with AQ/Naxx but at that time Hunters have less DPS-Increase becasue they have already early High-Damage
---
&gt; Dungeon Finder? It‚Äôs the only way to play a dungeon from three expansions ago while leveling.
---
I agree completely. I think the current way dungeons work on retail is damn near perfect. You have the dungeon finder for the more casual and easier difficulties (Including levelling) and then have to manually find a group for Mythic+ which is where the good rewards are. It's far better than the extremes of all dungeon finder and none at all.
---
&gt;Rushing the new-player experience? Because you cannot possibly gate-keep the current expansion (where the majority population is) behind 110 levels leveling at their original pace.
---
I've been saying for years that the issue is with raising the level cap more than anything. It forces Blizzard to speed up levelling when it should have stayed at 60 (Or 70 if you want 10 levels of expansion content) and kept levelling at around the same speed (Or a little faster) than classic was. As it is now, you can literally race through 1-60 in a day.
---
In my opinion, all expansions should be level 60 (Or 60-70) content and players unlock expansion features via story quests rather than what level you are. Eg, to unlock The Arcatraz	 you'd need to complete most of the Netherstorm zone, to unlock The Oculus, you need to complete most of Borean Tundra etc, same goes for raids. But to stop power creep, old raids get their difficulty and gear nerfed (Including all gear players already acquired) down to dungeon blues so the gear treadmill can begin again in the next expansion. In other words, old content becomes completely optional but not trivialised like it is now.
---
True! But that's very, very late into progression.
---
Oh no, it's retarded.
---
Cry more kiddo.
---
Yeah, I call out FF XIV as a bad example in another comment. They‚Äôre on their way to the same problems. There are aready quest-skipping items and XP-speed items implemented. 
---
Also, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but my understanding is that the way they scale max level characters in lower level group content is by removing talents‚Äîwhich I‚Äôve read is incredibly jarring. 
---
All-in-all, I don‚Äôt FF XIV doing anything differently, especially with its apparently oppressive main quest.
---
Whats fun about paying 50g?
---
I've been doing the healthy thingamajig for a while, eating better, losing health and that kinda stuff, and I plan on continuing for as long as I can into classic, because I know that game is gonna consume my life for a good while, might as well prepare for it so I don't die from a random embolism or a heart attack from my slobby ways.
---
Paladin does double warrior
---
This exactly. I'm watching people have a ton of fun, and I'm worried that the beta for 3 months is going to get old for a ton of people and the community won't be there when it actually releases...
---
is air conditioning not a thing where you are??
---
Wasn't the first cloth hood like level 24 or 27
---
Azure cowl or something
---
Thats been life on pservers. Layers will be a welcome relief
---
dps specc with sword and board can tank just fine all the way to lvl 60 dungeons ( or at least into late 50s)
---
The blue post clearly states that it's a bug, 
---
&gt;This is a known issue that we are actively investigating. Please &gt;continue to report these types of mob-behavior if they are &gt;happening in other locations.
---
Every other youtube comment too. "Its just hype" is the new, freshly planted goalpost.
---
It was possible though.
---
I think 50g cap is too much and it was made before things like minmax raiding + minmax pvp at same time happened. Surely it should be a fee to pay, but something like 25g cap is way more reasonable. But #Nochanges I guess, I'll just have to convince my guild to do the raid before and after reset then wait 2 weeks tactic to keep respec costs low.
---
you see , you are dishonest .. the issue is not the streamers , it is the constant REPOSTING and hidden/silent advertisement for streamers in this subreddit ..
---
you acknowledge asmongold spam in youtube is annoying and you allow that to fester here ? that just dishonest

only ? have you been sleeping below a rock for the past decade ?
---
do you realize how many recordings there are ? dunno if i am talking to a fool with blind faith or some kind of hermit who first recently discovered the web...

Yes blizzard needs to be fact checked... just becourse a man prepared fugu fish 10 years ago doesnt mean u should trust he can still do so after such a long break and that is why there are licenses for such... tried to cut it out in cardboard for ya...

Dwarf Hunter

Yep. Super late game, Hunters kinda get fully shafted. It's a real bummer.

Ok thank you!

---
Ive been told by people they wouldnt play an ally rogue because orcs have 25% stun resistance. What do you think? Also are those in order from best to worst?
---
Don't die.
---
Play classic.
---
Pick one.
---
God I hate those tiny heart shapped cloaks you keep getting for the first 20ish lvls
---
Reposts of the same video or clip from a stream should be moderated, I agree.
---
However as the majority of people did not get into the closed beta the only way to experience it is through the gameplay of the streamers. If something really cool happens on a stream then I'd be happy to see it here, regardless of who the streamer is or how I feel about them.
---
Streamers so far have just been a force for good when it comes to classic- they advertise classic well and they helped campaign for it in the first place.
---
This would be a very easy excuse to make very simplistic gear sets in the future
---
Yeah it is a really cool aesthetic, I took that thread and turned it into a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqoQwOjdglA) if you prefer a summary of the findings.
---
"...And then everyone became evil because we needed more raid bosses. The end."
---
Dwarf is good vs melees and rogues. Super nice as a rogue to be dwarf.   
---
Night elf hunters can hide when they are defending in pvp.  
---
Human are always decent in pvp, more reputation and you can find the rogues
---
Same. Theory crafting weird specs and doing world PvP are my favorite two things in wow. The level 30 meta is amazing, fresh, and will never again be relevant. It‚Äôs like my favorite parts of meme specs and twinking on a whole new level.

Classic is for people who longed to play WOW in the old ways , i stopped playing WOW due to cataclysm destroying old world , tried to go back but it got worse and worse every expansion..
---
i would never buy BFA after got disappointed with Legion , yet i will resubscribe WOW for the chance of playing WOW Classic..
---
Yeah - amusing to me reading some circa 2005 comments on here about how druids can‚Äôt tank when the private server meta now is to bring a bear.
---
Top DPS with Bis: Warrior &gt; Rogue &gt; Mages
---
MC: should be around 200-400 DPS  
---
BWL: 300-600  
---
AQ : 400-800  
---
Naxx: 500-1100 (Depense on BiS)
---
Naxxramas Gear is as good as Early-Raid-TBC Gear.
---
My guess would be that whatever was possible in Vanilla will be in Classic.
---
Meh. Gambling is gambling. 12 bucks isn't much to wager.
---
What does min max mean? I‚Äôve seen this said a lot before
---
We had a Druid tank in vanilla. It depends on your guild.
---
Well it was said on his Discord server... and other people on this thread are cosigning this so...
---
Hey, if you wanna pay someone else to play the game for you, be my guest. I know there's no real way to entirely combat gold farmers but would much rather have them than WoW tokens.
---
Near the Alliance outpost in Stonetalon Peaks.  There's a group quest  "The Den" as a part of a big chain where you have to go in with several people and kill elites.
---
Its good in that it forces players into specializations. The whole point of Classic WoW is that you are not a hero who can do everything, you specialize into a role.
---
The bad thing is that this is not equal, as tanks and healers struggle with grinding gold, forcing them to level another character. This results in less tanks and healers in general, which impacts the ocean of DPSers who cant find groups.
---
Yes theoretically speaking, a tank could charge people gold for running them through lvl 60 dungeons and make his money that way, but this goes against the community aspect of the game. Charging people gold for playing with them is a bad precedent for building server community and overall enjoyment of the game, even though this will happen.
---
It's one thing to post content from streamers that directly applies to the development of the game (which is what a lot of us are interested in). But it's another thing to ceaselessly post  streamers just trolling, making jokes, failing at something, etc. That's what twitch is for.  
---
If we wanted the entertainment aspects of streamers, we would watch their streams.
---
It started in the blasted lands and Asmon‚Äôs raid kited him all the way north
---
I don't expect anything, I wanna follow both and I can voice my opinion.
---
What makes you think they are going to let a server become 4x populated in the first place? They can still have queues with layering, and they can reduce the pop cap gradually before removing layering.
---
&gt; I tried lvling from 20-120 in the open world in BfA (with my mag'har orc) and it was super boring. Meanwhile i've leveled 6 characters to 60 in vanilla on private servers and im looking forward to lvling another one in august.
---
It's not a fair comparison, though.
---
For me, leveling in WoW right now is kind of "eh."  But I've leveled several characters through.  There's nothing new for me to discover.  I've run both Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms, I've gone all over Outlands, I've attacked Northrend from both sides, I did all the Cata zones multiple times (well, maybe only a couple times for Vashj'ir), did all the Pandaria zones, etc., etc.  Of course it's "boring" now.  Whereas Classic is a different set of stories and all.  The talent points each level will be nice, sure.  But you're going somewhere different and doing something different.
---
It also helps make the leveling more interesting when you don't have as much to do at endgame so the leveling feels more like "the game" to you, rather than trying to get through leveling quickly just to get a prize at the end.  You're leveling an allied race, that means you're pretty much doing it to get that armor from hitting max level, which means you're not so much choosing to level all the way from min to max again, you're having to take it on as a chore.  As much as I've enjoyed leveling characters in WoW, I haven't gotten an allied race close yet because it just feels silly to have to level them from the bottom (especially as it makes absolutely no sense in the story for them to go back in time, experience a mixed jumble of timelines, and eventually help the Alliance/Horde meet and then ally with the race they're members of).  It's less an issue of leveling being "boring" (though leveling in Classic would be "boring" if you do it for the 30th time), more an issue that allied races have a poor philosophy behind them.
---
It's maximizing their power and minimizing their vulnerabilities. Essentially. It's super high optimization, basically.
---
I played vanilla for 3 years, cant wait for official vanilla. CBA to play anything else except Magic and Skyrim
---
"Look for a dude named "Tips" on Youtube. He has great videos on this and very straight forward."
---
Made me chuckle :D
---
Exactly
---
There are a *lot* of servers in WoW as it is, making one or two of them WotLK servers isn't going to destroy retail. 
---
Personally though, I'd like for a "timelost" server or two which is perpetually on 1.12 to appease the purists here and the rest of the servers are on a constantly updating 1.13+ which hopefully eventually adds a redesigned Outland and Northrend as level 60 content.
---
You could ask that question about many, many Vanilla mechanics. The end result when you take away everything you might not consider fun is BFA, at which point everything is so easy that *none* of it is fun
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=22057](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22057) Brazier of Invocation.
---
This actually has potential to be a bigger problem than anyone realizes. Like, I‚Äôm pretty sure a substantial percentage of players who started after LFD will not know where the dungeons are and will need to google the entrance location.
---
Heal is also "what you do"
---
Tank is also "what you do"
---
There is a difference between something that‚Äôs not fun and something that takes away fun, I don‚Äôt find a bit of farming fun draining, just not as fun as some other game activities. And to be wholly fair, you can make 2 priests if you like the class that much and want to run it two ways, I‚Äôm doing that with my locks
---
No official word yet but I'm betting they won't even need to for a while. Eventually, probably, when hype dies down a little.
---
I call shenanigans
---
"I was stabbed in the knee back then, I need to be stabbed in the knee again now"
---
I don't feel they will change it, but I don't think I will end up playing Priest because of it, I will probably go Mage or Warlock and not have to pay fees as often.
---
I don't know what their end goal intention is with layering but from the stress test and your stream it seems they are switching people at random and seeing what happens.
---
In other games with layering (asian MMOs from my personal experience) you can manually switch between layers whenever you like, with each layer indicating how populated they are. I would hazard a guess that blizzard will implement a feature like this at some point with the layers to avoid people being automatically switched in the middle of a cave full of mobs or whilst doing an escort quest. 
---
Or they may not. Whilst it's annoying you gotta appreciate that you're taking part in a BETA TEST so sometimes things might not work as intended and have annoying side effects. Submit a bug report and move on.
---
Yes, that will work. Note gnomish cap can‚Äôt be used while you‚Äôre in combat.
---
Mob means "monsters in bunch".
---
Because being tank in a PUG is even more ungrateful than being a healer. Also leveling.
---
correct, also there is no blizzard report a bug interface
---
Can you elaborate?   I started in wrath, just now doing research on all healers to pick potential characters.
---
It would be cool if they kept a few servers open for Classic that don't have new content to keep the world pristine and how it always was... But maybe add new servers with the option to copy over our characters that have new content for those that do want to progress and play a new timeline.
---
They could eventually do this for other past expansions too and manage to keep everyone happy and subscribing.
---
Great post. I'd add exercises as well. If you like to run you can download C25K and spend very few hours per week. I'm a lazy pig and hate workouts, but I can spend some time running on the street just to be a little more healthy.
---
Well, if pvp rogue, then dwarf. Restealth is easier, you can break out of blinds etc.
---
Well, as long as it's not 100%.. :p
---
I did, in fact. However, this is the most intact, most complete rendering that I could find that I would *want* to have printed. So, sure, if I was going to sit there and scrutinize every corner of the map at length for any given amount of time, it would bother me.  As it's going to post up between my wife's and I's computers in the gaming room, it has all the proper 'looks cool' factor I need.
---
You say one thing then your next sentence contradicts it. lol. There were not "unintended" consequences, Blizzard knew exactly what they were doing.
---
Thanks man! Good look
---
wow there buddy. We should calm down. I am not allowing anything to fester anywhere. I just didn't noticed that problem, what i noticed is that people don't like it and every soul talking about it. That is why i posted in the first place. You want to get rid of clips. Sure go ahead who i am to say no. If there are really so many reposts when it is problem i admit it, but i didn't noticed that. 
---
I am no advocate. I am just nobody who wait for classic. Heck i don't even watch streamers, just clips from this subreddit.
---
https://youtu.be/6xhgvouRprw?t=17
---
youll need sound on
---
I‚Äôm not talking about crazy changes to spells/talents or adding new ones to homogenize everything, I‚Äôm talking small changes to damage numbers to make the ‚Äúbad‚Äù specs a little more competitive. 
---
And even if they did do a whole rework of the classes/specs to homogenize everything, it would still be nothing like BFA because of vanillas RPG elements and lack of group finder.
---
&gt; gl getting dft as hunter
---
Well, that's what is BiS until... I think Naxx?
---
I can't recall what my second trinket was. I didn't have DFT but I know a few hunters in my guild did. Once melee DPS have it, you can get it.
---
Respec cost is necessary
---
Blizzard could and dis confirm all the world firsts
---
Eminem is white trash
---
But I havent seen a Hunter in BiS with Survivel Spec. Because the Survivel-Spec gives you close to 50-60% crit because of the 15% Agility you get. I hope I get to so a Hunter with that gear and BiS-Talent-Tree at classic
---
1-20 is nowhere near a third in playtime though
---
And that's how shards are to begin with. Faction dominated or a ghost town. I've gone through most of Northrend questing without seeing another player.
---
If 39 ppl in your raid has TF, you can give it to the last mage/warlock

**&lt;FREE HUGS&gt;** *[H]* *[US]* üá∫üá∏ **[PvP]** (Tue, Wed, Thur: 7 - 10 PM CST) *English*
---
üëã **INTRO** 
---
We are known as **FREE HUGS**, a newly formed friendly guild that was created April 11th, 2019. We are a *semi-hardcore* guild; we aren't as strict as some other hardcore guilds, but we will be serious when we need to be.
---
‚è∞ **SCHEDULE**
---
We are planning on raiding on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 7 to 10 PM CST. We will start raiding once we get a full 40 man group leveled, geared, informed, and ready to go! All of that might take about a month after game launch.
---
‚úÖ **GOALS**
---
- Full clear all raids including Naxxramas
---
- Obtaining all the legendaries
---
- Get high ranks in PvP
---
- Gain server first
---
- Expand our guild
---
- Having fun!
---
üí∞ **LOOT**
---
We use a well organized and developed DKP system to disperse loot in raids. Players can gain and lose points based on their performance and preparedness. (More information about it is in our guild channel.)
---
**RECRUITS**
---
We are currently accepting anyone, of any class, of any experience, of any age.
---
We will accept anyone who has the dedication to support our guild, aiding in raid progression, and who have a love for the game. If you haven't played Vanilla, don't worry! We have other veteran members who can help you learn the game.
---
üí¨ **CONTACT**
---
If you are interested, or have any questions about the guild, please send the Guild Leader a Discord message @NeonInuGanetto#3614
---
Or you can ask your party members. It's not a problem
---
Farming as a healer is something very different and as for having 2 characters not all of us have that time.
---
But no Priest brings a Light Well.
---
I think the first three to six months will be an observation phase to see how the retention is. Blizzard aren't going to make any firm choices until they know what they're dealing with.
---
He is also a dick who admits ninja-ing in the past and fucking with people just to be a dick. So negative opinions are not entirely unfounded.
---
It's sharding, sharding is still turned on in classic, those things will not happen after it will be launched (unless they will forget to turn off sharding)  
---
There're videos of people sharded between realms
---
I'll have to check it out!
---
Back in vanilla my younger brother and I both played in high school. He was only about 15 and just played casually. I was much further than him and played way more. 
---
He started getting ‚Äúsick of it‚Äù when his warrior got to about level 20. We never played together (shared family computer) so I was curious as to what he had been doing. I logged in with his character and he was wearing mostly white items with only a few greens. How, I still don‚Äôt know. 
---
I switched to my level 60 rogue and bought him basically a full set of the best equipment I could find in the AH and mailed it to him. He had renewed interest for a while but lost it once he found out his role in dungeons was to tank lol. I tried to help him but he was just mad he wasted so much time playing a tank when he just wanted to dps and he never got back into it.
---
I'd argue that it was substance they removed. 
---
The leveling process and gameplay is so disconnected from your character and the world now. Push buttons for dopamine reward.
---
Back in the day you had to work for your rewards. You loved your characters because you sunk hours into them. You appreciated the world because you had to travel around it. You appreciated other players because you needed them. Naturally you'd all get to know each other.
---
WoW has been converted into a money machine. That's all it is today.
---
Well for OT its the best Trinket since you're not Prot specced and well...idk when you get Styleens as OT.
---
&gt;i just can't... Why so much hate for streamers? 
---
I watched the the entire stream of the SM cath race between Asmond and Sonii. One of the hunters is asmonds party clean says.  
---
&gt;I think i found a bug, our hunters marks are stacking
---
Asmond cleans says to his party and his stream of 50,000. "Good! don't report it." The bug is that higher levels of hunters mark are supposed to overwrite lower level versions. 1 hunter was using rank 4. the other was using rank 5. This is really the only reason those hunters were able to blast through those mobs. They did not report a bug to win a "world 1st race". I have went back looking for that comment in the video he uploaded. In Asmonds actual clip. He speeds up certain parts and clean cut out an entire section. The section where the hunter mentions the bug, and his response. It was around the time the hunters figured out they could kite mobs up and down the stairs and Asmond complains that mobs are parrying him, even though he is behind them.
---
The streamers that have 25k plus viewers are not bug reporting unless it literally hinders their play at the time. Asmond literally stopped in the middle of a WSG to send 2 bug reports. one was when the flag holder got fear through the wall and horde was able to cap. The other was when the flag carriers' location for the opposing team was not showing up on the map. He stopped in mid and filed bug report while bitching about it, he was so mad he could not type straight. The final straw for me and Asmonds stream was when his buddy Mcconnel didnt get beta invite. Asmond went on stream and begged blizzard to give his leveling buddy a beta invite, and they did it.

Flying mounts and LFG/LFR
---
On PVP servers, you can only have Horde *or* Alliance characters, not both. On Normal (PvE) servers, you can have both factions.
---
Jokes on them I'm in beta and my sub ran out today (can still play beta).
---
Warriors are fucking boss in Classic, but they take a larger time requirement than any other class in the game. You're essentially playing 2 characters at once as you'll be expected to perform in tanking and DPS roles. That's slightly less true if you're one of your guild's main tanks as that will be a more "permanent" role, but you'll still want to remain flexible.
---
As a DPS Warrior you'll want to collect the best DPS gear (obviously) as well as the best tank gear that you can. Some raid fights require additional tanks and that's where Fury offtanks come in. You'll also be expected to tank 5 mans often since tanks are rarer than DPS (it's a lot more intense role so fewer people want to do it).
---
You'll want to dedicate a lot of time to grinding gold as a bunch of your best items will be rare and expensive BOEs, and you'll also be spending more on stuff like consumables.
---
Rogues are a lot more straightforward. You do DPS and don't require nearly as much maintenance as Warriors, but you may be overshadowed slightly by those Warriors.
---
It basically comes down to thematic preference (stealthy speedy boy or big hulking juggernaut), the time you're willing to dedicate to the game, and whether you're willing to tank.
---
Those are about your only options for optimal melee DPS. There are some other odd things you can do, like Wing Clip Hunter. Hunters starts off as great ranged DPS in the earlier phases but start to fall behind the other DPS classes later in the game. You still provide utility with stuff like Tranq shot, and you can spam Wing Clip with a Nightfall equipped to provide a resistance debuff for your raid.
---
same here but then again, they start at 7.1.5 so it leaves me wondering about many factors that play a major role in the end.
---
Dude
---
How cool would that be. Imagine the entire 40 man raid together in one super big room.
---
Prot
---
Oh, then I'd say like probably lvl 15 or so

Does playtime matter? You can easily trial classes from 1-10
---
 [https://willitclassic.com/](https://willitclassic.com/)   
---
Almost at the very end, between 'Carbonite' and 'Dominos Classic', is what you're looking for.
---
Does it matter? I‚Äôm all in on classic but does the fact that a mob takes a step in the wrong direction going to affect your enjoyment of the game?
---
It is impossible to get the real 2004 experience because it‚Äôs not 2004.
---
Wow, that's big for me, thanks a bunch!
---
found the pizza cutter. All edge and no point.
---
That would have issues like having the same character 3 times, each with different progress on things like achievements and attunements which would suck if somebody wanted to split their time between TBC and WotLK. A better way to do it (Although I have absolutely no idea how it could be implemented) is to be able to play the same character on each server. If you log into Classic, you're level 60 with Gear Set A, if you relogged to TBC you'd be level 70 with Gear Set B and if you relogged to WotLK, you'd be level 80 with Gear Set C.
---
Then again, now that I think about it this is basically just copied characters sharing levels, achievements, completed quests and so on.

Yeah I've never played on any private servers or even really watched any Wow streams on Twitch at all until I wanted to see the beta. So this whole batch of streamers is new to me. I knew Asmongold obviously but I didn't care for his crowd so I never watched his streams. Now that there is Wow footage I actually want to see I'm trying to feel it all out. StaySafe was my favorite because he was funny in a sarcastic way, has a cute doggo and always eats awesome food - all while being truly knowledgeable. 
---
The mgtow thing kind of surprises me because he mentioned on his stream once that the woman who brought his food asked about his Twitch hoodie and how he told her about his stream and a quick look at his IG made it seem like he had a girlfriend. None of this really matters to me as far as content, but obviously I can't support a misogynist.
---
FeelsBadMan =/ Really bums me out.
---
&gt;They bring more attention to classic so that's good.
---
Why is this good, ive seen this thrown around and I want to know the rationale behind it, through a classic players point of view.
---
There are addons from the start, yes.
---
There is probably a lvl 8 paladin twink running about
---
I feel like these puns are floundering
---
What to you mean locked? On a pvp server you can only be 1 faction
---
no but 20 is a better number for a trial, lets tou try out WSG, a dungeon or two, etc. hut the limitations like talking and trading make you sub. i thought 20 was a perfect cap for trial
---
It took brand new content to become more successful.
---
more people playing game is always better, no?
---
I learned blacksmithing in ancitipation of my lvl40 as hunt...
---
Anyone who doesn't like it should be unable to play Classic
---
FUCK YOU BLIZZARD! What a pathetic moveüòë
---
old news
---
I think back then they were called inside jokes
---
Don't get me wrong I am not saying respecs should be free, not at all, but 50g is too much.
---
I think ultimately the winners will be the gold farmers selling it for IRL cash.
---
Observational selection bias. Because you are aware of streamers getting in, it biases you towards believing that they are a majority, when in reality, they make up a small percentage of the actual beta.
---
Heroic classic dungeons would be great, and probably not too difficult to implement all things considered.
---
Regarding any future stuff, I think it'd go a lot better if they just kept a handle on the extreme power creep. Just need to keep it more linear, like how fresh 60 -&gt; MC -&gt; BWL -&gt; etc was. I raided Vanilla thru Cata and I think we can all agree that the general mechanical complexity and difficulty increase was much improved, but none of that requires the sort of power creep that was implemented! Tweak some numbers and expac raids could follow a similar power level curve. And I don't think anyone here *wants* those extreme power jumps ever again, because if they did they wouldn't be chomping at the bit to be Lv1 again :)
---
It's also there as a money sink in order to keep the max level players paying a fee ever so often (like you do to buy new spells when leveling). It's basically just there to keep players from piling gold up, and as such stabilize the economy.
---
Thats what I am asking you lol, why is it better
---
Can you resub with your gold even if you can't log in (due to no time left) to buy the token? Is there a service online to do that?
---
I have so many memories of classic. But playing now I have so much more knowledge that its a nice mix but also feels like a brand new game to me because I understand so much more and know where everything is.
---
Take better care of your stuff.
---
Yeah but Arms just offers more utility. Imp charge, deep wounds, tactical mastery, imp overpower, anger mgmt, sweeping strikes. A lot of these will help a lot during wpvp.
---
I feel like Fury was born through the /sit Enrage abuse and became the standard on pservers.
---
Noted!
---
&gt;  Level 60 dungeons are definitely way harder, though they'll still be relatively easy for todays players.
---
60 dungeons are faceroll too.
---
Dot, dash. One, zero. Why not?
---
I feel like this question is asked at least twice a day..
---
yeah lets get a sub for only classic memes while we are at it, and also a sub for classic complaints, and a sub for classic suggestions, and a sub for classic art, and a sub for classic videos, and a sub for classic dev updates, and a sub for classic bug reports, and a sub for classic related questions, and a sub for classic guides, and a sub for classic setup rate requests, and a sub for classic 2004 screenshots, and a sub for classic maps pictures, and a sub for "insert something something here".
---
Who have had... what, one truly successful expansion since WotLK? And even that one had it's flaws and annoyances when it first launched (Holy shit were Warlocks in a bad place then).
---
I actually haven't read any of the WoW Chronicles books.  I need to get on that.  I think the majority of the books deal with TBC and beyond.  I really enjoyed War of the Ancients, but that is definitely more TBC content.
---
You are telling me to take off the tinfoil hat ? You ?!
---
The problem has been reported, solved. YOU  have no right to fact check people because YOU have 0 facts or facts based on private server data.
---
ALL the video evidence from the corroborates blizzard's data.
---
You just want the data to be wrong because that's how you remember it.
---
Likewise the way "people in bfa" are derided by people here.
---
Oh I didn't know that (not an RS player). Can you back that up with stats or give more information? Nothing personal, just gamers throw around the word "dying" way too easily at this point.
---
LOL at the people who's gonna be using that
---
Yeah it's a tough problem, it'll be interesting to see how blizzard tackles it.
---
Cool.
---
What's rotten at the core of Retail WoW is that it's not designed by the same people anymore.
---
One team was amazing. Then Cata happened and now their team is trash.
---
I've heard the bestiary is based on patch 2.3 data, so some things in it are incorrect; mostly things involving Azeroth group quests, which were largely reworked into solo quests in 2.3. I don't think that's relevant here, though, because they aren't using 2.3 data in Classic, so wherever the bestiary matches with Classic things were just never changed.
---
More people playing = more success in eyes of Blizzard = more dedication and more resources to classic in future and maybe, just maybe they will listen to fanbase more oftem. :)
---
Man it's not worth it. I downloaded the game in anticipation for it and the beta and Decided to okay the free until level 30 thing and it's just too different I didn't want to.
---
I did the same thing. Made it through the first rounds of heroic+ and just said fuck it, this is boring. I know its some peoples cup of tea, but certainly not mine.
---
Undead has will of the forsaken so I‚Äôd pick them.
---
How did they get it into Stormwind? Where exactly does this one spawn?
---
I can HEAR the bubbler noises
---
People here are so smug it's almost comical.
---
Those are some intense mental gymnastics, man. An addition is definitely a change. 
---
The question of how to deal with progression is definitely complicated. I think progression servers are far more likely than backporting BC content into Classic.
---
Mind control and WSG can produce strange situtations: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKIYMZPUahU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKIYMZPUahU)
---
Part of why I hate retail is how watered down and homogeneous classes feel, you dont  speak for everyone.
---
it doesn't make the game more in demand. When you see theres a 10 hour queue for you to get in, you aren't like "YES I WANT TO SIT HERE FOR 10 HOURS TO PLAY FOR AN HOUR" (at least normal people aren't)      
---
I'm just curious how it would feel like a dead game no ones playing if they had ~3k player layers, when vanilla servers used to be around that pop.
---
Just carrying a 1-hander isn't enough because you won't be lvling up the weapon skill and won't be able to hit anything when called to tank.  Which is why its better to lvl as fury if you want that option.
---
Orc is BIS but you wouldn‚Äôt regret going undead either. Imo undead look cooler so I would choose them
---
There were questing addons in vanilla, too, just not necessarily the same ones. I doubt Blizz would want to ban these, as you said, just don't install them if you prefer not to.
---
I think a lot of Warriors want to be 1337 DPS rather than tanks, though.
---
Spriests are really good for any PvP situation.
---
He needs to farm the karma here.
---
SPriest in AB are hilarious. Mind Controlling off the cliff is priceless.
---
I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
---
The idea is to make players commit more to a single spec, rather than changing their abilities all the time to deal with whatever they're currently doing. If you want to PvP and raid with the same character, consider choosing a talent build that allows you to do both adequately - this kind of compromise is the essence of RPGs, you don't just get to be the best at everything, you have to choose what you want to specialise in.
---
That in mind, if anything I feel like Classic didn't go far enough with respec costs. The point was to disincentivise players from running multiple specs on the same character, and it evidently failed to do so adequately.
---
Would I change anything now? No, we're past the point of no return, and people are really loss averse. But if I could go back in time and change how things were originally implemented, I would have massively raised the cap, but decreased the base cost and increased the rate of decay. Let it be practically free if you only respec once every month or two, but completely unaffordable to respec every few days.
---
Asmon is a ass for sure, but that is just him entertaining his viewers. Dude acts smart and elitist simply because he is smart and a bit of an elitist.  I personally did not like him at first but he deff grows on you.
---
It‚Äôs very possible that LFG/LFR addons will be broken before the game is released. Blizzard has said there are some ‚Äúsocial features‚Äù possible in new addons that they don‚Äôt want in Classic but they haven‚Äôt expanded on that yet.
---
Yeah, this is a private server. And right now on the private server this guy is almost certainly playing on, the amount of beta hype has made it almost unplayable. 12K people online, literally hundreds of people &lt;10 all doing the same quests. The spawn rates for mobs in the starter zones are completely insane, like 10 seconds or something and EXTREMELY dense. Frequently an entire respawn wave just tunnel visions one dude and wipes him out.
---
It was actually the first time I‚Äôve ever turned on his stream and I found it pretty entertaining.
---
Exact same
---
I don't think i've seen a Blizzard post on what occurs when they need to remove a layer or if they will remove/destroy a layer. They have stated that a layer comprises a continent of either Eastern Kingdoms or Kalimdor, so if you hop on a boat or hearth to the other continent you will get phased already. They can probably just use any of the travel events such as hearths, flight paths, boats, airships or entering/leaving an instance as an opportunity to wind down a layer. Combat phasing should never occur.
---
Hi! I posted the first survey and got 800 results, but I don't know how the Internet works and used Survey Monkey and they apparently only allow you to analyze 100 results for free accounts. Still working with them to let me have the data for cheaper than one month of service (40 bucks -- my wife would murder me).... which is why you haven't seen the results yet.
---
Hopefully I can work it out and I post those results. OR hopefully this survey gets good results as well. :D
---
Good luck!
---
Amazing vid. I have never played a warrior and never done big open World PvPing like that. Would someone who has tell me if they(him) are actually playing good/smart? Or is it more like a setup for the purpose of the film? :)
---
Literally the same. 
---
ISTP and main Priest. I have about 6 of them. I also play Shaman and Druid on the side but keep going back to my Blood Elf.
---
1. [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-leveling-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-leveling-classic-wow) It's good to have dps set and tank set (1h+shield, but DW is also ok on higher dungs for faster rage/threat generation). To swamp You can use Outfitter it will be avbl.
---
2. All 5man dungs You can tank is as fury.
---
3. Pepople telling that priest. But i was lvl with druid and it was also ok.
---
4. \-
---
5. Dps using battle/berzerker stance, tank using defensive stance, battle and beginning for charge.
---
6. Don't use defensive stance as a fury dps, maybe in leveling progress, when my healer got agro so i changed to defensive for taunt.
---
7. fury warr - dps for raids. best in DW.
---
8. \-
---
Back during TBC when I could have a pally horde side, I leveled up to about 30 as ret and then switched to prot for AoE. The AoE probably wasn't very time efficient, but it was more for fun than anything.
---
I had a few vids up on youtube back in the day of it. They didn't age too well haha!
---
You missed the part where he made his investment back
---
He does so much shit for likes and luls, making good content you know....smh
---
You're laughing now, exactly till you'll be forced to use it yourself.
---
Lol just makes me spend a bit more cash to play the game how I like...
---
Thanks this is what I wanted to know, I thought it was both types, I recall playing on a PVE server and not being able to select opposite faction.
---
World of roguecraft ep 1
---
No no no. Everyone in this room is helping play a single character.
---
My cousin and I recently played westfall and the goretusk lovers are a bitch to find.
---
I think you're being purposely dense but I'll bite
---
The vast majority of people can't play the game yet because it's in beta, so obviously, the only content around Classic is from streamers at the moment.
---
But again, I'm willing to bet you know that and are just bitter about not getting into the beta, or just think you're edgy by saying "STREAMERS BAD!"
---
I'd love seasons but they'd need to significantly increase the speed of levelling for it to work. I don't want to spend 3 months hitting level 60 only to have to do it all over again a week later. I also think they'd need to take a page from Path of Exile's book and have each league have a unique mechanic.
---
The expansion problems would have reared their ugly heads anyway. Come hang out in Kevin Jordan‚Äôs Twitch, where we talk about this stuff a lot.
---
World of Roguecraft started it. Masterful, timeless piece.
---
A couple of days for me, i got in on the first EU wave of invites for non-streamers.
---
This really shows how bad bfa is, the problem is that blizzard doesn‚Äôt see it themselves 
---
I think retail is in trouble
---
Theoretically orc and troll have the best PvE racials and undead has the best for PvP.
---
BUT just take UD, as WotF will save you from running into fire or something similar... so the more survivabillity, the longer you stay alive, the longer you can make dmg. And cannibalize is just badass \^\^
---
Gotta is x-perl for authentic vanilla experience.
---
At this point it seems obvious that the problem is somewhere between the keyboard and the chair. People will go to any length to avoid accepting they're wrong.
---
No concrete info, just that they want to keep the number small to avoid empty servers.
---
Man, Reddit should really implement some sort of system where people can show their support or dissatisfaction with the content that gets posted.
---
It's not like warriors even have a choice. The first 10 talent points HAVE to be spent on stance dancing in arms. This is not a choice for any tank warrior if they have any idea what they are doing.
---
No word yet. All we know is they want as few as possible with high populations on each. 
---
Honestly, even Blizzard doesn't know yet. It's impossible to tell how popular Classic is going to be at launch, and then after a week, a month, 6 months.
---
&gt; EDIT2: looks like they nerved the dungeons in 1.12
---
[citation_needed]
---
I feel like this isnt want I am trying to get at. The game is already being made and the designe philosphy will simply not be changing, there was much support before the streamers became involved, enough to get the project into the real world. The servers are already "promised" to be kept up and more people on other servers/layers won't feel like more players.  So what do more players or more hype do for the players, not blizzard, the players. The level of dedication won't be relevant for about 6 phases likly because no real development is going to be in real time.
---
So you're asking for changes now? You couldn't make this shit up lol. Maybe people meant no changes from my private server. 
---
It was never that hard... anyone who actually played it could have told you that. They're making this for fans of Vanilla, not private server players.
---
If you're too stupid to press less buttons in order to not pull aggro as a well geared DPS, you don't deserve a competent tank. 
---
Nobody gives a shit if you top meters in 5-mans.
---
It was changed some time during vanilla. Well before 1.12 iirc.
---
WTT TBC gold for WotlK gold
---
Would actually be cool if you could place addons on a second monitor without the game stretching over both.
---
You aren't wrong in that assumption. Good thing is up until i'd say DM, a pure dps spec warrior can toss a crappy shield on, go defensive stance and tank just fine all dungeons. 
---
I have no comment on viability of this in DM though as by that point people were already raiding and most tanks I ran into during vanilla were in their tanking raid spec.
---
Orc is nice for the obvious stun resist passive and the AP racial beserk.
---
Undead is pretty awesome for the Will of The Forsaken, which is great for when fighting warriors/priests/locks and negating fear. Cannibalism is pretty sweet as well and can be pretty clutch for some extra HP in a pinch.
---
I won‚Äôt even lie to you, you kind of made me want to play warrior with all the effort you‚Äôve put into this message for me. I greatly appreciate and think I will play warrior because of all this ü§òüèº might do a warlock as an alt
---
Well considering warriors only real aoe in is battlestance at that level, it does kind of matter.
---
Can't wait to main holy paladin!
---
Is on privates, where it is overbuffed to be harder. People optimized stuff.
---
Problem with only 1 level is time required to achieve it. A lot of people would give up because you have been playing a week and still you are only 70% to level.. and there has been no rewards on way there. It would really feel lame.
---
&gt; Or Reckoning sitting tactic with big two handed 
---
Wont work, thats a private Server Thing.
---
At this moment, people get their content mainly from streamers because many of them are not in the beta.
---
Server capacity being significantly improved since the days of vanilla, and the layering technology, they wont have a need to spam out realm servers.
---
Now, I havent heard what the max capacity is that each server can handle, but its definately higher than what they'll want the server population to be.
---
They mentioned that each layer created during the release zerg fest will have a similar capacity of the old vanilla realm servers.
---
I don‚Äôt mind Resto but enhancement is my shit. It‚Äôs just so unexplainably cool. Due to lore I guess. But I would like to level a warrior as well so I‚Äôm not overly concerned about top tier shit with my sham

That's the exact argument live players used against Classic servers for years, and now as a Classic player you're trying to use it against TBC players...
---
He suffers from Main Hero Syndrome, where his sidekicks are more interesting than him. Esfand and McCuck definitely makes him tolerable
---
Actually, none of those things came from a small minority.
---
Everyone thought the things you listed would be good ideas. If we rewind to 2006, I guarantee you the vast majority of WoW players would say, "yes please an LFG would be great!" "It sucks getting keys, it takes 100 hours to even get to do the pre-raid dungeons! Just let us into the raid, its not fair I have to do this on all my alts!" "Its boring not getting gear for an entire month while you wait for the one drop you need from the eye!"
---
Now, we turned out to be wrong, but it definitely wasn't a minority that got us really any of the things WoW has now. They all seemed like great ideas, they just ruin what makes WoW so good in the first place.
---
Why does every word start with a capital letter?
---
If you master SPriest, you'll melt faces. Regardless the situation you get in.
---
Ret and switch to Holy at 60
---
There were questing addons back then too.  Don‚Äôt want one?  Don‚Äôt use one.
---
I got in as a non streamer, and the vast majority of people you bump into aren't streamers.
---
THAT is a man of wise words
---
Curious why you think this will meaningfully increase subs?
---
Atvi missed last Q by like 150mill
---
I see, that is bad. Can people watching these guys report bugs? Someone could do clip of that and give it to Blizzard.
---
I went back and watched one of the interviews with Tips and Blizz said a layer is an entire continent. You can have multiple entire eastern kingdoms for example. If that's the case, you do switch layers when you travel to Kalimdor or vice versa. Otherwise logging or joining a group should be the only instances.
---
I recently finished the mythos and started on the last guardian today. Love it!
---
The only trinkets that "cause" physical damage are indirectly all the summoning ones (and no, they don't scale except the mechanical dragonling one, and that one just scales its level w/ your engineering one) and the death ray, which is considered a spell and it's quite uncertain whether it scales or not and what it may scale of.
---
Anything else is either a straight stat boost, a utility effect or elemental damage on use or proc.
---
That bug was seen by thousands of people and recorded with video evidence. That's a better bug report than you will ever get with the in game tool.
---
I see your point, but a large percentage of people entering classic already know where all these items/quests are, so it is truly QoL.  
---
As for new players, yea it will probably affect their experience and perception of the game
---
I resubbed lately with all the classic hype. I don't expect to get a beta invite, but I'm having a blast spamming warsong gulch and doing side quest while I stream my fav streamers playing classic. It's fun hype that makes me excited.
---
westfall is actually pretty bad since the zone involves a lot of running around, darkshore is way better
---
What was original? I did this early in release.
---
I think I capped out at 5 and definitely couldn't use /1 or any other channels. Might have been a gold cap too but wasnt in a position to get any. Couldn't pick up secondary or trade skills either.
---
I think the better idea is to just have expansion content be for level 60 and you unlock stuff via questing rather than XP. So rather than unlocking Hellfire Ramparts at level 63, you unlock it after completing part of the main storyline of Hellfire Peninsula.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people use this logic. This is a beta test. To find bugs. To test. 
---
In their design philosophy and tech panel at blizzcon, the lead designer outright said they are trying to create the game by taking the modern client and working backwards, doing this they can see what‚Äôs wrong and then change it. This may be one of those things. Just like the tilting gryphons, or lamp posts being a wrong colour, maybe this isn‚Äôt a big deal on its own but if you add up a shitload of small things they can add to a change in atmosphere.
---
Also, if it‚Äôs not typical behaviour, it‚Äôs important to report as bug anyways because you don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs happening, that‚Äôs the point of a beta test. Then the team can check under the hood on it.
---
&gt;NE Hunter is the best class for starting out classic and amassing resources like mining and herbalism ?
---
Remember in classic you can only track one thing at a time, So if you track flowers you can't track ore, so you either need to constantly switch between them, or just focus on one.
---
It's better to  pair skinning with either herbs or ore while leveling, and just vendor your leather. 
---
Hunter is nice because you can send your pet while you skin / mine/ or pick a flower.
---
However remember than Mining is much much slower than the other two, because your going to need to mine a node 2 or three times to empty it. Which is also good because if your have several friendly miners each can take a turn with one pick each to get the skill ups in crowded scenarios)
---
&gt;Frost mage best for AoE farming for skinning mobs ? and portal / teleport to anywhere in the world ?  
---
&gt;best starting PROFESSION = Tailoring (to make bags) ? and Gathering professions ?
---
If your going for pure leveling speed. None,  Wait until your 60 and then start leveling professions.
---
At server launch, herbs, ore, are dirt cheap because everyone is leveling them hoping to cash in with early money.
---
The market always gets really soft. Unfortunately, best thing you can do is throw them in the bank and wait for prices to rise before selling.  Stack sizes are smaller, bags are tiny, and space is very  limited. So trying to save everything you get from gathering from two professions will really stretch the storage abilities of your character and your bank alts.
---
Even skinning can slow you down.
---
Two hunters can chain kill faster than 1 skinner can skin all their kills, even if all the dead mobs are stacked so that the skinner never has to move at all, eventually one of the the hunters will have to stop killing and help the skinner catch up, or watch the loot bags disappear unskinned.
---
&gt;best way to make gold for new player in server = farm materiel and sell in AH?
---
Skinning is usually the profession taken for leveling, because you can skin your kills and just vendor the leather. then just drop it later for something better. (unless your nearly server first 60 and can cash in on the devilsaur mafia)
---
The other professions can make money, however the entire server is broke, so they are really an investment for when guilds are gearing up for raiding,  and people begin leveling alts and twinks.
---
&gt;someone said rogue can make gold by unlocking chests.. is this outside or inside instances ? and is it really profitable ? or this is getting paid by tips for opening other people‚Äôs chests in capital cities?
---
This is "ok" tips money, however, you could be out  making better gold per hour doing almost anything else.
---
It's really something you only do when your trying to chain battle grounds and have longish queues, because someone has to be in town to Queue the group. Or if your in town anyway and someone offers a tip worth your while to open a box.
---
Mages also sell portals, food, and are a better option,
---
Both mages and rogues (tips based services) are better paired with an enchanting. Since you will be stuck in town anyway, because there are no vellums and you need to enchant items in the "do not trade" window. So they are another "service" you can provide while waiting for sales.
---
&gt;worst starting profession = blacksmith and enchanting ?
---
Enchanting is a great starting profession. Just leave it at skill level 1, and disenchant stuff for mats to sell on AH.
---
Level 1 enchanting is all that is required to disenchant anything in the game.  If you go this route, you want to get an addon that will tell you the vendor price of everything, and you really want to stay on top of AH prices for various enchanting materials.
---
Or just level it enough to make wands to sell on the AH, Priest, and warlocks will pay dearly for the first two enchanter wands.
---
It depends where it was. It wasn't some blanket that applies to everything in the game. 
---
I don't think I could pull two of the big packs before Drak in UBRS, but earlier dungeons, yeah all the time. Maybe you didn't know what you were doing? Or maybe your memories predate the patch we're on.
---
Mob movement before you gain aggro in general is not as it was in vanilla.  Back then mobs would instantly turn to their next waypoint and go in a straight line to it. Now they gently turn in a more realistic manner going from way point to way point.
---
Idk if they ever intend on changing it since it's something so minor. This is probably one of those things.
---
12? The sub is 19.99 USD which comes out to like $27 CAD where I live..
---
I disagree. I think there's a lot of stuff Retail can have while keeping the good parts from Classic. There's definitely room for improvement. Stuff like Transmog, Achievements, Battle Pets, Collections, LFD and LFR. Yes, they'll never remove those and these features by themselves change the game by a very large margin. And I really don't mind any of these. I kinda wish there was no LFR so more people would be motivated to raid but that's all. 
---
But what about everything else? Watch Mike's video again. He doesn't talk about anything I mentioned above. The things he talks about do have a place in retail too. People who play retail want them. Blizzard just doesn't design the game with those principles.
---
That is absolutely insane, I do not under stand why you wouldn‚Äôt just get a quality paper print for much cheaper.
---
I‚Äôm with you. No point racing to 60 if I‚Äôm just going to have to wait for everyone else to catch up anyways.
---
Well druids still can't block, so they are vulnerable to Devastating (?) Blows.
---
How come they are meta now and how are they dealing with that?
---
Whats the difference between looking for a group in chat versus a raid tool?
---
Orc Warlock with Succubus and draintank spec :-)
---
If you want to really be efficient, install one of the level helper addons that tell you exactly which quest to do and where to go to get to 60 as fast as possible.
---
If you want the adventure, don't use quest helpers.
---
In (classic) WoW, getting to 60 is already a big, entertaining part in itself and there is no need to rush it too much. Unless you want to be one of the first to clear a hard raid, just lay back and enjoy playing as you like. There will always be people leveling faster and people leveling slower than you.
---
No one will use it dont worry
---
A streamer did this like yesterday on the beta, it's going to be back in full force!

^((note to whiners: no one gives a shiny shit how much you hate streamers))
---
Minimum investment, maximum gain. Optimising,  a rotation is an example, as are very specific talent builds.
---
With an healing set you can heal lv 60 dungeons in retri spec. You can still farm for gold in ret. Raiding recruires you to be holy.
---
Ofc holy is better if you can healing dungeons and if you farm your gold tru mining or herbalism its fine to go holy earlier. Just not before level 60 because leveling in holy is really slow.
---
stuff like dungeon/raid leaderboards (like D3 seasons maybe) and arena would be cool in classic eventually (not sure if it would be bonus toward r14 or would have current arena brackets &amp; titles). There was a blue post saying they had no plans currently for post-naxx, but were open to community input so maybe it will become OSRS style.
---
*Activision
---
I got gkicked from a guild for feign deathing in AQ40 as we were trying to progress. Probably a matter of frustration over the wipes but yeahhhh lol
---
I still have mine on retail from vanilla :)
---
I was able to tank end game dungeons fine as Arms. I think it's more a question of convincing DPS warriors to tank than whether they are viable.
---
The stress test definitely had a queue.
---
I haven‚Äôt experienced queuing on the beta yet. Even after a restart I can get straight back on.
---
Like I said in another comment, it may be possible to split the player base 3/4 times it‚Äôs not really very clear but it is pretty clear that smaller servers on live and classic alike will possibly have to be merged if we go with TBC and WOTLK, as they‚Äôre already struggling. Maybe just TBC wouldn‚Äôt change anything, who knows.
---
All of the streamers are a little memey in their own way, part of the gaming culture I guess. I had never really heard him say anything like "Girls, lul" which is why I was surprised when someone in his Discord server said that. I kinda wrote it off as it just being edgelord shenanigans, but I figured I'd throw it out there to get more info. The only thing neckbeardish I've really heard was the whole "Sperg" thing - but that seems to be a Wow term in general and not specific to him.
---
Yeah but after phase 6 maybe we will get something new? Who knows? Hmm... maybe you are right in the end. But what bad comes from it then? Other than threads where we argue like here.
---
Hopefully locked on PVP. Reason being little twats who will cus you out if you kill em
---
I think we finally found the real WoW Killer guys.
---
Classic is unique in it's being made specifically for a part Of The community. Retail is an ordinary game that they should innovate with and try to make as good as possible, wherever those elements come from
---
Sounds just like what they did in the beta (yesterday?). Are you sure that is your own memory? :)
---
They fixed walljumping
---
No, wasted talent point. You can only have one curse on an enemy at the time and if it ain't doing damage then it's not going up. The point of this build is to get max dps and max healing potential. Since so many points are wasted, imo, in the demonology tree you need as much damage as you can to offset. I recall using it at first and its just a very situational spell to use such as ctf. 
---
Also something that might not be obvious about this build is the strategy the player needs to do and that is run in the middle of the enemy and have them focus on you like a tank. Since you are a cloth wearer you are seen as squishy but with the healing potential you are anything but that. It does reverse the rolls in your favor and you have to adjust for that.
---
I'm sure it is, like it was in 2014.  Some of us have ascended
---
They shoot a blue lazzor that continously (channeling) melts face(hp)
---
A guess is that a lot of their spells have to do with destroying the opponents mind
---
We have a choise instead of the mandotory handholding there is in modern wow.
---
I'll advise new player to atleast play for some time without it because its really immersive and fun to experience it.
---
But everyone is free to play however they want.
---
I have this also. Much better conditions though
---
I used a quest helper in vanilla in 05-06. And before that i used thottbot.
---
The most noteworthy items I can think of from leatherworking is  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=143/devilsaur-armor](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=143/devilsaur-armor). This is fairly late for leveling but I expect the server first prices to be extremely high on these. Pretty much any AP class guide has these listed as the BiS preraid or at least an honorable mention.
---
Assuming you want LW and it isn't purely a question about financials, I think I would go for Mining &amp; Skinning to start. Use a LW leveling guide to plan ahead what you will need from skinning and vendor the remainder. Vendor the stones you get from mining and AH the Tin/Silver you get. Tin should be in high demand as it sucks to farm for any crafter. Dont be afraid to list(and relist and relist...) these a little higher than AH prices. At the very least engineers will be pushing their crafting levels and be needing boatloads of bronze. Copper is questionable to me. Vendor it, AH it, sit on it... not sure.
---
Once you run out of tin node zones is when I would switch mining to LW. It's possible that there are some choice items that would sell well on the AH.. my main focus would be to craft easy to obtain gear that would cut down on my leveling time though.
---
I would also drop skinning for Enchanting some point in the 40's-50's. I prefer running dungeons to solo farming and being able to disenchant for high level mats goes a long way(all you need is level 1 to disenchant). Skinning does give you some decent farm options if you wanted to go that route(as well as the pristine hide of the beast). 
---
TLDR: Players won't have a lot of money to spend for the first 30+ days. Vendor skins is easy gold for time spent and push yourself to be the first crafters of preraid BiS items that people are willing to spend their early gold on.
---
Yeah thanks, I really love the way warrior looks and plays, I don‚Äôt play it to top dps I couldn‚Äôt care less about that I just love warrior classes in all mmos, I‚Äôll play it but if I can‚Äôt find a raid guild I‚Äôll just get my full pre raid bis with titanic leggings, lion heart helm and ironfoe and just stop there gear wise until raids go on farm then I can yoink all the old gear I guess :D
---
Man... everbody has forgotten the company that created mop, wod, bfa?  The company that has ruined wow for 10 plus years?  Remember loot boxes?  Remember all the dumb money they spent on analyzing how much money they can extrsct from you and ignoring fun game design?  
---
And now everybody has been blinded by the beta release and by streamers having a good time.  Stop drinking blizzards koolaid.  Stop downvoting users that have a different opinion than what blizzard spoonfeeds you.  Judge with your own eyes.  If you think lvl 30s can tank lvl 40 elites is ok, then thats on you.  But it just sickens me to see this subreddit get swindled again by blizzards tactics.
---
A lot. Lots of maps look different or are completly gone, so enjoy exploring. ;)
---
Osrs had about 5-10k active players until the devs were convinced to start fixing/adding new things.  I've been playing the game for around 15 years now and still actively playing at this moment.  I don't have evidence for whether or not those numbers are truly factual because I do not know how to obtain them.  But what I am doing is confirming the guys post above from experiencing it first hand myself and being there when the first updates started happening.  I'm sure others can confirm.I
---
That being said, comparing classic to Osrs is not a fair comparison and it's not something we should outright copy. Osrs is what I've been calling for years "a single player game in a mmo world" and classic is anything but that. 
---
Before people start advocating for changes I believe the game needs to come out first.

Well I think you can make the case that the community that wanted the game has now become a mix with those who have stumbled upon the game. Which is why I see so many fights start in this sub I think

Yeah, at least water is good for you and easy to make. I just hand out demon candy which is made and traded one at a time and requires me to find and kill a mob for each of the 40 raid members. Oh and the materials for it don't stack so I need to spend an obscene amount of money on a special bag to hold it all.

This is how I remember my fights against spriests in vanilla going:
---
* Mana drain, mana drain, mana drain
---
* Oh shit I have no mana I can't do anything
---
* oh fuck they're melting my face
---
* ded
---
It's because they literally melt faces. Much of their damage is in long-duration DoT, and the opponent is feared or slowed or stunned while melting to death. The only other spec in Vanilla that does damage primarily through DoTs is Affliction Warlock, which isn't seen too often in PvP because Warlock PvE specs elect do direct damage due to the 16-debuff limit (so you'd only see an AffLock if they had respecced or if they did PvP exclusively).
---
Shadowpriests don't really have burst, since their main direct damage spell is on a short cooldown and its enabling buff in Discipline isn't a fraction as "bursty" as something like Presence of Mind. But if you encounter one, you're liable to be CC-locked as you rapidly bleed all your health away, unless you have a method of removing their Shadow Word: Pain.
---
Asmongold sometimes had 100k viewers. People watch and post his stuff because they enjoy it, not because they are paid. I don't think that invalidates any of your other points, but continuously repeating "it's like their paid or something!" is making you seem dumb and salty
---
I understand that many people will but I don't think its representative of the playerbase. Having 4 vanilla accounts I assume you are a huge fan of vanilla, there are several people I know who have never played wow or played briefly but want to come back to try classic, these are the kinda of people that are very unlikely to sub before release. 
---
Also, I thought the purpose was name reserve, as long as you are there on release you should be able to get a spot on any server no? Not sure what you mean by spot reserve, correct me if i'm wrong but no servers will be full immediately at launch will they?
---
People don't seem to quite understand the main difference between sharding and layering.
---
**Layering is not based on your location.**
---
In layering the goal is provide a full, populated experience for all players while negating the massive unpleasantness of launch experience.
---
For example in Elwynn Forest Fargodeep mine will be a massive bottleneck even on a single layer. 
---
The difference now is that the people in Fargodeep stopping you from progressing will be the same people you kill hogger 5 levels later.
---
However this does not mean 0 layer switching. Sometimes layers will become under populated from people logging off or joining friends. When that happens the layers must rearrange themselves.
---

The blue post you linked that says this is a bug, they‚Äôre aware of it, and that they‚Äôre working on a fix?  Seems like they‚Äôd need testing to fix it though... almost like that‚Äôs what a stress test, like the one your video is from, is for.  Huh... weird.
---
That cap is VERY hard to reach. Even for a level 37 Scarlet Evoker you need 10635 armor to reach it. For a level 60 mob you need 16500. Basically outside of being a level 60 Prot warrior fighting level 20 mobs (armor cap: 6300) you will basically never reach armor cap.

50g respec is part of the authentic Vanilla experience. Nothing can change that. Vanilla doesnt care about your feelings or social life ;)
---
I can't be arsed to find the sources, but the game when released had a high and healthy population of maybe 50-60k online at all times. But after some months it kept dropping lower and lower and in the end was around 10-17k concurrent online players at most.
---
-
---
Then they started to reintroduce some content that they polled, examples being God wars dungeon (I'd say it's like releasing a new raid in wow), some updates to skills, quality of life content etc.
---
Gradually it brought more and more life to the game and it used to be back to around 50-80k players at most time. Then during some bigger releases 100k+ concurrent players and after mobile was released it tended to stay above 100k at almost all times. Right now there's 67k online. In the end it's a very healthy amount and the game is doing quite well for itself.
---
I kinda stopped playing since I got burnt out but I did get above 2000 total level and experienced most of the content and quests. It's just that when you get very high level you just grind same thing over on repeat for hours. It's a great game to chill with while doing other things though.
---
Battlestation
---
and some people actually praise blizzard for layering because "its so much better than sharding", im not bashing on anybody i just want people to be realistic.
---
This is correct as far as I remember. Tanking on my warrior, this was the technique you used to move mobs or position a boss (against a wall or a door or whatever).
---
I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt see a queue for the stress test?
---
Clearly you didn‚Äôt actually play the stress test.

If this is the server I think it is this is because there was a group of alliance lowbies camping it with a 60.

---
I couldn't find a patch note for exactly when they put hard leashes on, but I remember the dissapointment when it happened.
---
There was, 3 of them lol.
---
Yes, 100%
---
so basically from what i gathered is private servers gave people false memories of mob damage and are now saying classic is too easy after asking for it for so long? even if mobs do less damage than pservers, im sure the game is still a million times better than retail.
---

That's really funny. Probably why I remembered it

---
Not actually true. It was a thing in vanilla in early patches, so not a "private server thing". Just something that shouldnt be in game when you are running patch 1.12.
---
I'll test it during the next stress test! I might make a small compilation of tricks on reddit or something, there's a few interesting death tricks in the game that should work in Classic
---
i logged on right after they restarted from spawning bosses
---
guess i got lucky
---
I agree. But I would be up for something completely new, as in not TBC or WOTLK
---
- Night Elf dislike of magic.
---
Its the entire foundation of Warcraft as a story, that these people played with magic and in the end it backfired, as the demons came along.
---
In live NE can be mages and the whole thing is more or less dropped, they dont love magic, its just not a "thing" anymore.
---
- Human/Hunter
---
The reason Humans and Gnomes not being able to be Hunters, while every other race can be one, is due to both races not having any affinity for nature or the wild. Gnomes are into tech, while Humans see themselves as civilized. In Warcraft 2, the ranged unit was a High Elf, in Warcraft 3, the ranged unit was a Dwarf. Its a pretty consistent element of this race.

1 v 1 vs a Mage as Paladin on my first char in early '06. Saturday afternoon questing in desolace. Every time this game would kill me while I tried to sneaky do my quests. After a while it annoyed me so hard I started to fight back. Use pots, bubble and lay on hands and still lost. We kept on fighting over and over untill I won. The moment I won my Lay on hands was of cooldown again so we have been fighting for over an hour. I knew next fight would be hard with Lay on hands on cooldown but I managed to win once more.
---
That was the moment I knew PvP was awesome. I practised, I Inproved, I learned.

you are being dishonest and projecting yourself into others..  Because you are bitter not getting beta invite doesnt mean everyone want to be in beta.. I certainly wouldnt waste my time in beta , i want to wait for the real deal as not to waste fun times on some test server that will be wiped.
---
there's certainly streamer fanboys like yourself that think they are gods or something , but no one cares about them except fanboys , good for them to have fun watching other people playing games.. not my idea of fun..
---
and after all that , you still miss the issue , the issue is not the streamers that you love so dearly , the issue is the constant contentless reposting of streamer video in this subreddit , as a way to either get subscriber or view to their twitch channel , as if it is good to post other people's content in here..
---
HI guys, today i was a bit bored and created this. I have a lot friends around different guilds/server and i wanna to make them play together. For planning in classic i created this.  
---
You can download the file and send it to your guilds / friends discord or anything :) Hope some of you find it helpfull!
---
Thankfully any warrior with half a brain can tank a dungeon regardless of the spec
---
I always hate these weirdo care bear posts. Whiskey, pizza and caffeine are what you need for launch week.
---
Definitely not a fan of "Streamer does X" posts on the sub.  I am not going to watch a twitch video of some goomba messing with the beta.
---
Heavily edited (in Microsoft Movie Maker) films of PVP or PVE set to Avenged Sevenfold and Eminem, I will upvote.

The BFA kids probably will, I feel sorry for them. Turn out our youngest guildmember is 35 at the moment so I doubt any one of us will bother with that crap
---
Groups of bad players by today's standards cleared Naxx in Vanilla. Almost every PvE video of this era is full of players doing stupid shit. 
---
The private servers are responsible for this complete myth that fucking Deadmines was a crucible of fire that required CC on every pull and it only got harder from there. 
---
There will be stuff in later dungeons that is more difficult, but Vanilla dungeons were never that hard. 
---
Most players don't want a level 40 dungeon to be a two-hour slog. If the biggest thing you desire in your game is difficulty in group content, play retail and push keys. Vanilla is about more than that.
---
Classic literally IS 1.13.
---
There is a quest reward lufa which removes bleed effects. You only have 1 chance to choose it and works up to level 60 in vanilla
---
I;d argue the opposite, they'd rather have people that left bfa. The point of classic is to draw in the audience they've lost with retail wow. 
---
Requiring a sub seems more of a "give us more money please" play too. It doesn't really make sense as anything but.
---
These people entered PvP with either a lvl 8 paladin twink - very common on private servers - or any low level alliance bait grouped up with a 60 that wiped the room as soon as they got flagged.
---
Any experienced player knows to never engage in PvP in Kul Tiras, this is a trick as old as vanilla.
---
Because the marketing department invited them, ya doof. :D
---
The fuck you been doing with the damn thing? It‚Äôs fucked!
---
That change in wording is likely because Kazzak and Azuregos are no longer in the first phase. They have said that they want to turn it off ASAP, hopefully within the first few weeks. The end of phase 1 is just the absolute cut off point so that there is only ever 1 copy of the world bosses.
---
The War of the Ancients is a great trilogy.  Worth a read /u/DymeGSZ
---
I have the beta and tested the script out while I was playing the other day. [Here is a video of it.](https://clips.twitch.tv/WealthyCuriousAardvarkAMPTropPunch)
---
It's in beta you dipshit
---
&gt; at some point 
---
Is the key thing here though, if it just auto did it to people who were w/i a rested area it wouldnt be a problem
---
That‚Äôs how FFXI was as well. 75 was the cap for most of the expansions. 99 level cap came much later.
---
To build on this - quests will be color coded based on estimated difficulty (based on your level). The amount of xp you get for turning in the quest is the same whether you do that specific quest while it‚Äôs red or green.
---
Well this is just a misconception about gold farming, and not an issue with respeccing at all. You mentioned priests in your post, which are probably the best gold farming class in a healer spec; since they get access to Holy Nova letting them AoE farm.
---
Not to mention there's fishing/cooking, profs, playing the AH, orb runs, recipe runs, etc; there's plenty of ways to make gold while in a healing spec. You're complaining that they aren't good at *one* form of getting gold, and disregarding all the other ways you can make plenty of gold.
---
Classic isn't retail. High respec costs help drive character identity, because you aren't supposed to be respeccing every 2 days. If you don't want to pay for them, don't.
---
This game was made for Vanilla players, not them.
---
you can get a sweet mail coif at 28 by doing the mor‚Äôladim quests in duskwood
---
I loved the real danger if the world. It felt so great having to actually have supplies and things on you for bad situations.
---
I think that you can tank with dps spec even beyond Deadmines. Another question is whether those warriors would want to do so. 3 dps warriors in the group and nobody wanting to tank is not a joke!
---
Verycoolguy is not the hero we need, but the hero we deserve
---
When people asked if spriest were any good the reaction asways was thay they melt faces. These comments were used 15 years ago already.
---
I agree, but again, troll zerk can give you an upper hand a 2vX situation (when you're accompanied by a healer and orc racial isn't to be used). Can't be *perfectly* minmaxed.
---
That book has survived 3 house moves, a flood and has been generally very well loved over its 10+years of ownership. I'm surprised that none of the pages have fallen out.

Nice.

Maybe add an overview for professions, like you did for classes on the right? (might be a problem if a raiding guild has no enchanter).
---
Also maybe add the different high end professions, where you have to choose stuff.

Levelled a nelf hunter to lvl30, decided I wanted to be a dwarf hunter so deleted the character including bags and gold. Made the dwarf character with a different name. Got to level 30. Decided I preferred the night elf. So deleted my character again and remade my first one. With the same name and looks.

Idk where it happened exactly but wow lost their way

I would say give it time first. We have two years of classic to play before anything needs to be decided.
---
Farming as a Resto Druid is actually very easy and affective, cast moonfire on a target and then insect swarm, keep doing that until you have 5-6 mobs, cast a HoT on yourself and then finish them off with hurricane, not sure about the other healers though
---
Either they are drastically misrepresenting layering, or it is unintended. I'd lean heavily towards unintended when it was literally the first stress test and they were probably fiddling with the settings quite a bit to see what happens.
---
Last guardian is super underrated

IIRC, it's the cave on the west side of the peak, which is near the alliance FP. It's been a looooong time since I've done that quest, and I don't really make a habit of going to stonetalon.

This is bullcrap. Only reason it looks like its a lot of streamers is cause that's who you're going to be watching. But when the streamer /who there's hundreds of players, streamers are a very small number of that.

You didn't play vanilla. This never happened, kek.

So, you may be right about what will happen, but you're wrong if you think I'm invested in changing anybody's perception.

The players you describe will cruise right past the World of Warcraft, level to 60, and immediately start raid logging while waiting for the next content phase. It's their loss.
---
Ive only levelled 2 characters to 120. I did no play during WoD, MoP or Cata and i still find those zones pretty boring with how easy they are with heirlooms and flying mounts.

And since the world is so unpopulated and i just follow a laid out path it becomes even more tedious.
---
I think Preach said it best. In vanilla the story is about you and your character, you write the story. In retail the story is just something you follow.
---
As far as I remember, people complained even before the release of tbc, because the expansion would devalue their characters and gear.

Blizzard said it will be the same people who were invited to the first stress test. No word if there will be new invites. I never got an official email. Just check your launcher for "Beta &amp; Stress Test:WOW" tonight. I think I got my access ~24hrs b4 servers went online.
---
I really like Stonetalon.  It has a good number of quests for Horde.  
---
It's just a bit of a pain to walk around especially if you die.  A lot of people are saying they'll skip zones like STM and Desolace, but I can't imagine skipping them since you pretty much need to quest in every single zone unless you're doing a ton of dungeons.  I usually only do dungeons once for the quests and that's only if I like the dungeon.  RFC and WC usually get a skip from me, since I usually outlevel the first and the second takes 2 hours minimum to complete.  I wind up getting XP from doing the full barrens and filling in the 15-17 range with a few quests from Silverpine Forest.  In Vanilla it's really hard to straight up ignore whole zones, especially ones where you can net a few levels like STM and Desolace.
---
There aren't many zones I straight up dislike.  Hillsbrad and STV are annoying due to ganking, but that's pretty much it.
---
I thought this might be the case. I Think it would make sense for them to do a week long open beta for everyone just before release to get a general idea rather than just a stress test though. I get a lot of people probably won't sub until release but it's probably good practise at this point.
---
ISTP also but I will be Rogue or Druid
---
Damn so much misinformation in that thread, dunno why people don't ask private server devs that already researched all that before.  
---
That second post makes no sense, it contradicts previous blue posts and the TBC formula that was later determined statistically.  
---
I would just assume classic uses the TBC formula until they tell us otherwise.
---
I always always wanted that. By the time getting that was an option for me I already had something better
---
On server launches I play as much as I can depending on my free time. Sometimes I ve played for 12+ hours a day. Its still the same pace as the times I play for 2 hours a day. I m not missing anything depending how much I play per day. I wouldnt be playing 12 hours if I wasnt having fun. I just do the same in a day what usually takes a week.
---
I'm here son!
---
A single layer can be the size of a 2004 vanilla server. Anything you could do on a 2004 server, you can do on a layered classic server.
---
The reading quests thing really hits home because it reminds me of those days long ago in early WoW and FFXI where nothing was pointed out to you, and even the quest wording was cryptic sometimes. You had to actually wander around and figure stuff out to finish a quest. While it might seem more tedious, it actually seems to hit different pleasure receptors in your brain. As opposed to "Kill 5 boars" and a giant arrow pointing toward an area 5ft away with 100 different boars to kill.
---
I dunno, we'll have to see how it all plays out in the end. I'm looking forward to being able to play Classic Wow and Halo 2 (PC) all over again (while also playing PokeMMO). It's like the gaming world aligned to bring me back to the early 2000's and relive those memories. If Animal Crossing comes out this year then I don't know how I'll be able to relieve all my favorite time sinks from back in the day.
---
The reason launches are problematic isn't because populations are large, it's because populations aren't stable or representative of normal use at that point. A lot of people want to play for 12 hours on launch day, sleep for 8  hours and then repeat for a few days to a week. After the launch period, people are back to their normal lives and aren't nolifing the game as much/ anymore. If a population stabilises at a high amount, additional resources can be diverted to it or free transfers can be provided to entice players away. It's really not much of a problem.
---
This. While TBC was pretty much a strict improvement, WOTLK introduced several mechanics that were ultimately harmful to the core design philosophy of WoW. Better to make new content (taking the good aspects of each xpac) than to just repeat the exact same mistakes.
---
Blizzard has discussed doing a level squish and they most likely will in either the next expansion or the one after. The fact that content scales to your level makes it so you aren't really tied to a certain zone either.
---
I love seeing that chat... people actually looking for groups
---
Exactly. Just look at the Tarren mill wars and when streamers do /who. Streamers are a small percentage of the whole, but they're the ones you see most because you're not going to run into a rando nobody's stream.
---
I'm going through chronicle vol 2 atm and I'll probably move to warcraft 2&amp;3 after that, but I completely forgot there are lore books as well... I'll have to check those out as well!
---
I did the same thing but as a NE, sort of. I died but went exploring as a wisp because it was fast and fell off the side of the tree. There is no back to graveyard button in vanilla, I didn't know what to do so I deleted the character and started over.
---
I don't know if I'd use EVE Online as an example. While they do add expansions that add content for PVE players to do, and of course do balance changes and overall modifications to try to influence the PVP side of things, much of EVE is based around nullsec/player combat. Those of us who live in these player empires/alliances are not even affected by these horizontal expansions, save for things that come out that change our ships (nerfs) or how we take or maintain claims on space, or from a bit ago putting up player made stations such as Keepstars. 
---
I did run a mud for many years, and ran into this whole power creep issue. High end players always wanting more and more, and I myself fell into the trap of adding more power into the game. Problem is once it is there, it is VERY HARD to remove - even for the good of the game. I'm agree something needs to be done with the retail version to scale things back and turn around the way things are, as I think people are tiring of the carrot chasing, among other things.
---
I'm looking forward to Classic, and honestly I wouldn't mind a TBC or WOTLK servers, provided they are kept separate. I wouldn't even mind LFD or some form of easier group assembly, just not LFR, but understand others do not want that anywhere near Classic at all, and I'm fine if it never gets there as well. I think official Blizzard Classic servers that don't pose the risk of losing your progress will make a big difference, and I hope they see high numbers of people coming to play them. By BlizzCon they may really know what they are looking at far as a  steady population I'd think. Be nice to have a permanent 1-60 server with content added horizontally, and the success showing them that it does work, and have that carry over to retail.
---
I literally didn't say anything about non-viewers wanting to see the clips or anything about how "great" the videos are.
---
Your response has nothing to do with my comment lmao
---
No healing class is pure damage, and every healer still supports.
---
Also Warlocks catch up to mages in DPS eventually. Especially if the firemage bug is private server only.
---
Warrior Tank stuck waiting till Aug....
---
Streamers are so annoying lol. It sucks that I can‚Äôt make my character until I know what servers to avoid because of streamers. I‚Äôd really rather not have a dragon kited into my city at level 30
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
The first week will see a substantial amount of players.  I can guarantee you 90% won't make it past the first month before they realize how much better retail is.  BFA represents 15 years of improvement.  Classic sucks.
---
Agreed. I dont mind seeing the streams being posted (especially in the streamer is doing something fun) my biggest issue is the multiple reposts of the exact same thing.
---
There are too many expansions. For me, I think they should take out as much bloat as possible and consolidate all the spaces into one, smaller world about 1/3 the size. 
---
Or rework BC, WOTLK, throw away all xpacs after that. Make that a thing 6 months before you offer Wow2.
---
You need to be socially active and not be obnoxious to get group members.
---
Likewise I'll never forgive them for what they did to Scholomance, UBRS, Scarlet Monastery, Stratholme and Sunken Temple.
---
I remember feeling like I looked so damn cool when I finally got a longer cloak and some shoulder pads. I think the first pads you could get were around lv16
---
Couldn't agree more. People always say to level first aid and not to worry about any other professions, but I strongly disagree. I always level cooking while leveling too because of how valuable those food buffs can be.
---
Nostalrius was something stupid like 40% warrior I had issues finding groups because tanks were so common at 60. Level 10-54 as a warrior was the worst leveling experience ive ever had in an mmo, but I can say at 60 it was worth it. But I totally dont hate myself enough to do that again
---
Must be nice and fun playing on the streamer beta. If only there was a large group of players ready and willing to properly test the content, that doesn‚Äôt care about the views they‚Äôre getting.
---
In Vanilla every class has a role.
---
Priests heal, they are in fact the best healer in game (stfu pallies :p ).
---
Shadow is perfect for levelling and PVP, but if you really want to be a true DPS why don't you roll a mage or a warlock ?
---
I think the stress test starts tomorrow at 5 est which sucks cause I'm stuck at work till 5:30 so by the time I get home I'll have only 1 hour of play time.
---
As far as I know, it's all completely relevant
---
There still is. Was on pservers yesterday and there were like 4 NEs raiding sun rock. They gave up after like an hour of killing anyone coming through the front.
---
Well in original classic we didn't really have mice with lots of buttons, so it was a bit of a juggle to use mouse to change directions and camera, and keyboard , and key binds. (mice turn much much faster and more pricisely  in PvP combat)
---
Now you can just simply get a Razor Naga or similar, and  now your have an amazing amount of key binds available. your left hand, can take care of strafing, jumping and modifiers, your right hand can control direction, camera,  and the majority of your in combat abilities.
---
yes, when you have enough gold for a token it will prompt you at the char selection screen to renew your sub with gold
---
Human interaction? Thats the main purpose of this whole game, lol.
---
God, i LOVED AV so much. Finally getting the unstoppable Force was so awesome - I didn't get any good two handed weapons from raids until blackwing lair because I was an offtank, so that thing was amazing. I STILL used it even when I had better weapons because of the knockback - that knockback was absolutely absurd and so useful. I'd switch to it whenever I was on a bridge or something.
---
God, the feels.
---
Wow, Thanks!
---
Yeah, players are going to have to break old habits of just steamrolling for max dps and will have to actually play accordingly. 
---
Especially for the first 40 levels or so, AoE tanking isn't much of a thing. Paladins have to spec 10 points into their healing tree just to get consecrate and that's saying a lot considering how poorly optimized they are for tanking.
---
Time to learn everyone!
---
Hold on to that one.
---
They always can do it as players log in and off. No need to do it mid-gameplay.
---
&gt;LFG, gearing, trivialisation of raids after new one releases.
---
I don't agree that those were problems in WotLK. LFG didn't get introduced until the end of the expansion. Gearing depended heavily on your spec and some specs had some interesting choices to make or goals to aim for, like armor penetration gear being extremely good for some classes but only after you gathered the gear to reach a high percentage of it while other gear was better until then. And the hard mode raids weren't really trivialized after the release of new ones. The first tier was trivialized halfway through them before Ulduar's release but Ulduar hard modes remained challenging after ToC's release and ToC's hard mode stayed challenging after ICC's release except for the people who got fully geared in the new raid's hard mode gear.
---
Thanks. Now I need to go there, I was kind of an explorer back in Vanilla, I'm surprised I didn't wander there (or maybe I don't remember) !
---
Hunter healing. Nice.
---
Yes i know. I will play with some RL Friends and they are pretty casual. For dungeons and leveling its maybe helpful. Anyways it adds a RP flair :)
---
I think he meant dire maul. The acronyms seem to change based off server from the old days, I'm used to dm meaning dead mines as well but its also known as VC after the end boss.
---
You know there's something between a two hour slog and a complete faceroll? I bet you can clear all instances naked without weapons, it's that easy.
---
Same! I love those books so much, such good reads
---
Hm, and max rank of [Frostbolt](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25304/frostbolt) has 0.814. And Consec won't scale more on higher rank. And [SoR](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20292/seal-of-righteousness) is 0.1, although it's not quite clear whether it applies to Judgement.
---
Looks like an awful scaling.
---
Haha I remember seeing people it that, it was handy as hell in AV, I really can‚Äôt wait for it! :D
---
Same here. Initially I wanted to wait and not even try but watching streamers made me really want to get in.
---
Absolutely! Most professions have SOMETHING that will help you out lower level too. Leatherworking lets you enchant 4 pieces of gear with extra armor, Engineering gives you a bunch of gizmos and gadgets that do damage to your targets giving you higher DPS. I try to make use of EVERYTHING the game has to offer while leveling just to smooth out the process!
---
I played with my dad way back in Vanilla and TBC. His first max level character was a night elf warrior. All through Vanilla and most of the way through TBC, after he was lvl 70 for quite some time, he would drink milk after every fight and in between pulls. Something like he had seen other people doing it and assumed it was beneficial.
---
We still joke about it to this day. Warrior Milk.
---
It depends alot on what your goals are. If you opt in for raiding, there are some classes that perform better than other
---
If your goal is dungeons, hybrids like druid or paladin who can take on any role shine there
---
If you like to play mostly solo, hunter or warlock are fun and capable
---
If you like pvp... i have no idea, i dont pvp
---
Most important is to choose something that will be fun for you. Leveling is no joke. It will take 100+ hours. You will be stuck with your character for a while. Make sure you actually enjoy playing it
---
(2) no ....  You just add more resources permanently to those specific servers....
---
this depends on 2 factors.
---
1- successful to what extent,
---
2- how many of those people will stop after 2 years and not give the expansion at the time a try.
---
So let's take an example let's say classic stabilize at 1 million subs. I would say that is the minimum required for blizzard to consider this as anything more than a side project that ended. Also, what is actually more important, is how many people leave after classic has been out for 2-3 years.
---
I am pretty sure blizzard will intentionally, wait  about a year maybe a bit more after releasing naxxramas, before even announcing anything (whether new content, or the more likely option a tbc classic server option. Why will they wait ? because this will be the period where they observe how many of the subs they gaining from classic will be lost, and how many of those players who were an active classic player, switched to the current expansion on modern servers. Let's say they see that out of the 1 million people who were playing classic exclusively on the battlenet, about 10-15% switch to modern wow. This will be the trigger to rush an announcement regarding classic content.
---
TLDR: if classic get 1M+ active subs and loses 80-85% of them once over in 2-3 years.
---
Blizz will announcement new vanilla content or tbc classic.
---
The important number is not the 1M+ sub, its the players lost at the end of the lifecycle, depending how big it is, blizz will respond accordingly.
---
Well apart from the slightly bigger mana pool, the extra spell crit gives you higher dps.
---
Oooh I hadn't even thought of the class/race combinations! This is something I really appreciate - while in live I do wish I could be a Horde druid AND wear boots, I'm fine with it for the lore element.
---
They always meant no changes from private server. How do you think 1.12 class balance was somehow considered the holy grail, when it wasn't at all in vanilla?
---
This is idiotic. the only way to properly report bugs to the devs is with the bug report tool. don't listen to idiots like this guy.
---
Only current patch content is worthwhile tbh, 15 years of content doing nothing is more accurate.
---
What‚Äôs the significance of level 8?
---
If you look at the map there is a part called stonetalon peak at the north west.  In the bottom left corner of that area there is a little cave you can see on the map.  That's the Den.

INFP  HORDE MAGE PVP
---
It was a maintenance day and the server that my friends and I played on was down. And we were getting bored. It was the only day we played. 
---
So we all rolled female gnome warlocks with pink pigtails for hair I think and we had our names spell out ‚Äúwe like to take big smelly dumps.‚Äù Obviously we had weird spelling but I was like 16 then and I‚Äôm 30 now so I definitely can‚Äôt remember that. 
---
We ran from dun morogh (spelling might be off) to the barrens. Dustwallow Marsh was rough to get through. An alliance hunter saw us and helped escort us through the area while we spammed demon skin over and over again. 
---
We finally hit the barrens and were between level 2-3 from exploration when we got there and we ended up near the graveyard area outside the crossroads and there was an orc warrior that was flagged for pvp. He had to be level 15-17 based on his gear and all of us working together some how brought him down. Vent exploded with excitement and laughter. We all logged off shortly after it was getting late. The next day it was back to the leveling grind. But those leveling breaks were awesome. I wish we had recorded that day.
---
Good. I plan to tank all the time and get anxious seeing these polls.
---
Hopefully streamers will announce what servers they are playing on so I can keep them the fuck away from me.
---
20h is about 3h per day. If you're schedule lines up with your guild raids the you could totally do it. A semi hardcore guild raids like 8h per week so if you can get to 60 there is nothing stopping you other than other life comnits
---
I been tanking since Wolk but stopped tanking because of how brain dead dps actually is comprared to tanking. I got to 9/9 M as ret dps virtually worry free. Just smashing my face into my keyboard and I usually pull 40k dps. Compared to tanking where you have to have everyone working with you (Cds, Positioning, Mechanics, etc.)
---
Welcome to the family. Hunter is an amazing class for leveling and learning the game. It‚Äôs got a bit of a Pok√©mon feel to it, and you will be powerful enough to do most things alone, while still bringing utility to groups if you want them. One of the biggest issues I had learning on a hunter was when I accidentally caused problems in dungeons. Your pet acts like an extra body, and sometimes it can get you into trouble. 
---
Major things to watch out for:
---
Pet aggro: your pet has three aggression settings (aggressive, defensive, passive). On passive it won‚Äôt do anything until you tell it to. On defensive, it will run up and attack anything that attacks you. On aggressive, it will automatically target and attack enemies. Often you have to be really careful when navigating dungeons, being smart about only pulling a few enemies at a time, and then giving the team a chance to rest and eat/drink to regain health/mana. An aggressive pet can mess that up by pulling new enemies before the team is ready. It can also attack crowd controlled targets and mess that up (something that is asleep/feared/sheeped will sober up when damaged).
---
Pet pathing: lots of times in dungeons you can skip areas by using clever pathing to save time. Maybe there‚Äôs a ledge you can jump off of and then you won‚Äôt have to fight the guard patrol on the staircase. For everyone else, you can just jump off. The hunter will have to dismiss his pet first. If you don‚Äôt, the pet won‚Äôt jump with you and instead will run the long way to catch up, and attract all the enemies that you just snuck past.  Also, if your pet chases a fleeing enemy, the pet might run to close to other enemies and attract their attention before your team is ready to fight them. 
---
Pet taunt: Your pet has an ability called growl that forces the enemy to attack it. If it uses this in a dungeon, it can pull the enemy off of the tank. They will not be happy about this. Make sure to turn off the auto-cast feature on taunt. It‚Äôs still a good idea to manually cast it sometimes - like if an enemy is attacking the healer and the tank is too far away or save them. But most of the time you won‚Äôt use it in dungeons.
---
Only login queue. It was around 5k+
---
Or 40, with mounts and stuff.
---
we don't know for sure yet but I'm certain there will be far less realms than on live
---
I can assure you you're full of shit on your last statement. 
---
No changes.
---
Flying didnt ruin wow... and why take out arena and dailies?
---
There's so many issues that comes up when you're talking about post-Naxx content and how it will invalidate classic and the classic feeling, so the obvious choice for Blizzard will simply be TBC.. an expansion that was loved by a vast, vast majority of the community. I just hope we can copy over our classic characters to the TBC servers so I can continue to progress with my then old character.
---
Tiny Crimson Whelpling
---
Dark Whelpling
---
Tiny Emerald Whelpling
---
All of them are pets and are quit expensive, you can try to farm them with grinding exp.
---
Hmm something tells me you didnt play vanilla
---
Ion already stated that any "new" content is a definite NO. How about you let people who enjoy vanilla play classic and you stick to retail.
---
You uh.. do realize that the points I mentioned are in the ARMS tree, yes? I did not state those talents as a "You have to take prot"
---
There is nothing to do on the beta so people are forced to get creative and they are.
---
Still great friends with everyone that was there that night and we still talk about that all the time. Can‚Äôt wait to have classic back.
---
I am hoping it will get easier to build legacy servers as once they have the vanilla client they can build off that. Hopefully it won't be years
---
Same here. I remember the really important stuff. But everything else is blurry.
---
Never read the Warcraft books but the ones he wrote for Diablo were awesome
---
I will definitely be subbing to play Classic, but have zero interested in reserving a game. I'll re-up my sub on the 26th.
---
Kinda wish we didn‚Äôt have a meta for classic. Part of the charm back then was that we weren‚Äôt min maxing everything.
---
I agree with this. Retail feels like a race and can be overwhelming to new players (or old ones coming back). I didn‚Äôt play BfA when it launched and didn‚Äôt finish Legion‚Äôs end content so I said screw it with trying to catch up to everyone since end game is all anyone cares about and I wouldn‚Äôt have any one to level with and I never re-subbed. 
---
On a side note, I‚Äôll never forget how insane it was to me when I first logged in when WoW released and there was so much going on and so many people running around. Even the starter zones were full of life and content. That might be nostalgia but damn it was fun.
---
i really enjoyed night of the dragon and before the storm (which i see youre missing)
---
Classic is a streamer game :-)
---
Thanks, this is what I was looking for and more or less what I expected
---
I know that would make sense, but there's also a sense of pride, like "well you don't like what we do, fuck you then" but also making sure the person is active enough to participate in the beta test I guess. If they scope the accounts some days prior, then maybe people subbing the day before don't get counted in? Many questions for sure!
---
Something like this makes me conflicted on whether it should be fixed.
---
Tactical mastery allows you to actually charge the mobs so you can generate a bit of rage at the beginning of every encounter. But yeah before lvl 30 once you switched to def stance you don't change stances anymore.
---
Threat per second.   Mobs have a threat list and the tank always needs to be the highest on that list.
---
I think people forgot how easy the leveling dungeons are and probably just remember how hard most level 60 were. The most notable ones I remember are Live and Undead Strat which can be a wipe fest, especially in the room in Live Strat with Battle Mages using aoe and the roaming elite packs in Undead Strat. Also the difficulty to clear the bar room in BRD, General Drakk and his two adds were always a tough as well as clearing the room just before the fight.
---
Are you retarded? What are you gonna do, run up to them and hope you dont miss with your auto attacks to generate aggro? I feel sorry for any groups who have the misfortune of having you as a tank, god forbid you try to do well in the role you are fulfilling.
---
I remember the guild, I was on lothar horde. LoWn(Legends of winter knights? I forget its been 15 years) .
---
I just started on a pserver and most people are incredibly nice.
---
Yeah, i was making the point you don't really need talent points but i missed the talents you mentioned and your point is fair.
---
Damn, I never thought of it like this
---
WE LOVE BLACKDICK
---
I bet this guy is real fun at parties.
---
it will still be playable on the 30th
---
Although I don't think time zone differs at all for EU servers, I'm pretty sure they're all on CET.
---
I am missing *a lot* of books.  I really need to pick up some of the newer ones.
---
Wrong. It's called Sundering main target while tab-targetting autos + Revenge procs for AoE. If you need AoE snap threat on pull pre-Cleave, you use Demo Shout in Defensive Stance.
---
Randy Sarah's battle station
---
When we fat finger out of cat or bear though...
---
There are far more of us in the beta than the handful of megavisible streamers.  Sorry you didn't get in.
---
Lower the cost by 5g once a week seems fine. Apparently it was monthly report n vanilla, cant say i remember that
---
PokeMMO? Are you talking about sword and shield? Or something else?
---
This reminds me of when me and bunch of my guildes made a bunch of level one characters and raided hogger. It did not go well
---
I wish we had some option to filter it out. Im not interested in watching streams and that crap keeps showing up everywhere
---
You gonna run your DPS meter through that printer?
---
were enemy cast bars a thing in Vanilla?
---
For something as monumental as WoW Classic? Hell yea I would pay for beta access
---
Azeroth
---
Haven't touched retail since WotLK, how does the new raid finder thing impact raiding this sort of stuff?  Do people still mostly raid in guilds or has everything become pug friendly and you just queue up solo/small groups to do your raiding?
---
Yup-those minor potions saved my behind so many times (especially when coming across the Murlocs in the Further Concerns quest).
---
I suspect I'll be making myself quite a few potions
---
This is straight up piracy, no?
---
Alternate title:
---
People are enjoying a game they haven't played in 15 years
---
Yeah, no kidding.

So long
---
you'll likely have to deal with hunters kiting mobs to cities regardless of the server you're on. it's a pretty well known thing that happened in vanilla so people will keep doing it just for that reason... also cause its fun
---
boomers, yikes.
---
In vanilla I was always so jealous of paladins as a warrior. You guys were friggin unkillable.
---
I use to think that paladins were OP, I remember being so mad when they got buffed.
---
Little did I know how much they struggled... I was young haha
---
Why the ''? Do you not believe them? Are you one of these "you may have the original numbers, but I have my original memories!" folks?
---
&gt; the goretusk lovers
---
tbh its probably a good thing that those are rare ‡≤†_‡≤†
---
is that the scent of tide pods I smell?
---
Not swedish myself, but I don't think German would be that hard, swedish is a germanic language after all, and probably closer to German than english is, seeing as it doesn't have half of it's vocabulary from romance languages. French might still be hard, but 5 years of school certainly gives op a headstart.
---
lol, thats true xD
---
There are some videos showing them breaking 1k dps in vanilla with many buffs so 2k, nah not unless there are some broken stuff
---
Layering is a stop gap measure that will only be I place temporarily right? Anyone know when Blizz is planning to phase it out? I‚Äôm thinking about not resubbing until they turn it off.

I have a feeling there will be a pretty big wave of new players that have never touched wow or played vanilla before.
---
I think you'll be fine.
---
If you had played a feral you would know that they tend to shift out of form quite a bit.
---
&gt;/4 lfm tank scholo
---
&gt;/w inv
---
Great interaction.
---
Priest is my main, Druid would be my alt. Shaman not so keen on leveling, despite them being awesome at 60. Paladin no chance since I play Horde.
---
RBG or other instanced PvP changes/additions would be fine down the road, but arena is a hard no from me. 
---
The problem with arena is that once small scale pvp was systematized into the game, classes had to be balanced against eachother for it. Things that don't matter much in group pvp (pom pyro mage) become op or unfun in a small scale arena setting, and get balanced away over time leading to a lot of the class homogenization of retail.
---
No thanks, tbc ruined wow.
---
The require different gear sets than warriors, so it's easier to deck out a MT and OT simultaneously.  With MCP, druids can out-threat warriors on dps intensive fights.  They also have higher health pools, so healers will have more time to react to spikes of damage. 
---
That's just my guess though, take it with a grain of salt.
---
I plan to ret till seal of command abd pursuit of justice. Then holy.
---
I hate the fact that everyone rushes to Max level now. When I made my first character back in 2006, I took like 9months or more to get to 60. I was slow at leveling, but it was moreso due to me taking advantage of all aspects of the game during that time. The game actually felt like it's own world then
---
The only useful application for stance dancing at lower levels is for Mocking Blow. Even then it's more often than not unnecessary in most situations after a Taunt is resisted. You're better off with the 5% Crit in the Fury tree.
---
Where is that confirmed? There's nothing about this on their official bug list.
---
I reached lvl 40 without defensive or berserker stance :')
---
I aggree with you but, unfortunately, you can"t level up profession AND buy your spells ranks AND have enough gold for a mouunt at level 40 if you plan to do a 'fast' leveling.
---
If you want to level with professions, it will take roughly 1-2 more weeks to catch up on gold/mats .
---
How about you just let people play the game the way that they want and stop making dumb threads like this. No ONE is forcing you to use any addons.
---
You do realize Beta accounts go for $1000+ atm right?
---
What? You must be mixing up some names because Crendor has been pro-Classic for a long time.
---
Np. No guarantee it helps, but if you post to blizzard support for help, they'd probably have suggested it. You could also ask around on your server and see of others are having the same issue. Then you'd know more likely if it was a local issue or server.
---
the only generation I've seen eat tide pods and air pods
---
Yep that is all stolen content.
---
&gt; German majority
---
*laughs in german √ºbermacht*
---
It's $15 USD.
---
Ah ok, so yea, they haven‚Äôt shut down invites there‚Äôs just less going out than before.  Makes sense because you‚Äôd want a trickle of new members not multiply your pool immediately.
---
So less than 1% of people originally did Naxx. Part of that was because TBC was coming out, but mostly it‚Äôs because it was too time consuming or too much effort to be prepared for it. 1.13 will have to be even harder. That might not go so well.  I would love TBC redone with no new level cap, but doing the zones quest lines and things allow you to get equally good gear as the end of vanilla. Giving players the options to either raid through AQ40/Naxx or questing zones in Outland/Outland dungeons to get you prepared for the Outland raids. I would love to see arena added in at that point. Personally I would keep flying mounts out. (Maybe slightly faster ground mounts?) talents were not perfect in Vanilla and I liked them better in TBC, not sure exactly how they should do the talent system, but maybe someone else can fill in the details I didn‚Äôt.
---
Shift out of form... to auto attack with their weapon during pvp?
---
uh huh.
---
Seen that happen a lot in internet cafe where I played. I even pointed out that you can reach spirit if you walk all the way around but people just couldn't be bothered and recreated character.
---
Those level 9 bears in Elwynn Forest. Killed my level 8 warrior at least 5-6 times before I decided it was impossible. I came back at level 10 and went on a bear killing spree now that I could deal with them and get some revenge.
---
Good luck getting a group for said dungeons without being able to talk :)
---
Perhaps its time for a sub strictly for streamer clips for Classic.  This sub was a lot smaller/slower moving even a month ago, at this point it might just be too big for that stuff to be here.
---
DW fury is absolute dog shit. You can get weaponskill quite easily. Just spend the 10 mins waiting for your group to fill on killing mobs with it, and you are fine.
---
Yes, but the legion invasion that happened 10000 years before, and made the night elves who they are. It connects strongly with the NE campaign in the Warcraft rts and is a great read for anyone waiting for classic :)
---
Be advised though, after I read it, I always want to roll NE druid.
---
I saw a YT video a few months ago but the guy was playing on retail.
---
It allowed him to make his UI better so that all the essential info would require less eye movement.
---
Can't tell you the name of the channel but a search might give you the answer.
---
My 60 doesn‚Äôt even have a full length cloak
---
They also have BIS for lvl 30.
---
I would pay good money to play TBC
---
The cloak that stops right below the shoulders always triggered me.
---
squeal like a piggy boy
---
So angry? The dude is just throwing ideas around! I prefer classic btw, before you go all ‚ÄúGTFO Retail Noob LULW‚Äù
---
I feel like a lot of things in class there are things that are a pain in the ass but ultimately rewarding when you accomplish them. That is the classic wow experience.
---
People sharing events Asmongold is going through do it so others may enjoy it as much as they do.
---
People, probably you, who post trashtalk about Asmongold because you... don't like that people actually like his content? I have no clue what kinda issues they actually have with Asmon, but it's just spreading negativity, while the other is spreading positivity.
---
Oh yeah? Like what
---
Ret to 40.  Prot to AOE till 60 solo. 
---
If you have a leveling buddy, then leveling to 60 as holy would work.
---
Just fyi he's trolling you
---
oO
---
You must have spent considerable gold at the AH to be mountless till 59 !!!
---
If you had ask me the question before, I would have told you it's impossible to be mountless after lvl 47-48 !
---
Can we just straight up ban posts asking about a patch 1.13 or changes to the formula that is vanilla WoW? This shit is a conservation project, not WoW Take Two, Electric Boogaloo. 
---
Battle station posts, art posts, and tattoos should all generally be left to other subreddits as well.
---
Only for English, French and German (and possibly Spanish but I don't think it's an option for EU servers). If you're Czech or Hungarian or Portuguese or whatever you have to go to an English server, usually whichever one already has a good population from your country which then becomes the unofficial server for it. There's no tag saying that a server is the unofficial Czech server but the amount of Czech in chat probably gives it away instantly.
---
It doesn't seem right to a lot of people but they say they 'verified' it. I guess it's entirely possible the server they set up has bugs in it, or they aren't accounting for something. 
---
There's a hunter ability in vanilla that just gives you a bunch of beast stats. It literally just tells you their damage. The values for those mobs would have been known so it would be easy to test those at least.
---
The reason they require a sub is because they know most people in a beta test dont actually test and give feedback. They just want to play the game for free and yeah Blizz isn't going to let that happen. This actually helps keep the retail server population high as the masses dont suddenly drop sub and play classic beta.
---
You posted this exact question yesterday and a bunch of us answered you, but you didn't like that we recommended Gnome, so you asked again?
---
Yes, the point Preach made about difficulty is that it's not just mechanics, but knowledge of how dangerous everyday mobs are and how to put yourself in safe situations. If these guys kill you 1v1 30-50% of the time, make a group or come back in a level or two.
---
less faceroll than leveling dungeons.
---
The way I see it; classic is the only world content that was removed entirely from retail, and is the only content release that deserves a re-release.
---
Selectively adding content from later expansions to breath extra life into classic is icing on the cake.
---
Re-releasing every expansion as a meticulous recreation (the way classic is) would be excessive.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs a Richter scale
---
Exactly that, yes.
---
&gt; 1990
---
&gt; immursion
---
Have you done a lot of BFA dungeons? The bosses have decently punishing and challenging mechanics and the trash can be dangerous as well a lot of the time in higher keys..
---
I did a lot of dungeons back in 2004 since I was an altoholic and it was my favorite thing. I don't remember anything as complex or fun as BFA dungeons back then but I do have a really bad memory so maybe I'm wrong. Excited to experience them again!
---
You think they intended to destroy social interaction and bonds? Why?
---
&gt;Is it so fucking hard to understand
---
Apparently it is lmao
---
Meanwhile over at OSRS we're clicking on 15 year old pixels and having a blast doing it.
---
It‚Äôs a fan made Pok√©mon mmo ran off of roms
---
I don't know for sure, I've never done this myself because it's lame. I think it's a mix of unlocking HoJ, having a few good BoE greens and being not too high level to bait people into attacking you.
---
Although you have a huge glowing mace screaming *TWINK* but that doesn't stop some foolish people to engage in PvP with you nonetheless, only to end up camped and unable to finish those Kul Tiras quests. Trully a natural selection kind of thing.
---
Lol Mccool
---
Great advice. If you are in a dungeon, use it on the healer!
---
Dont confuse the word noob with the word noobie. The latter means a player that is inexperienced and new to the game. The word "noob" has come to mean a player that is simply bad.
---
A player that previous played a harder version of the game, and then complain the current version is too easy, is not a noob.
---
I specifically said i wouldnt play gnome &amp; people didnt give definitive answers. So yes. Im asking again.
---
Quick define the role of someone who heals? And someone who tanks? Healer and tank? No fucking way? So why is dps the only one that‚Äôs different.
---
Same dumb US clowns who use VC instead of DM started using DPS over DD.
---
Irl equivalent would be throwing your napkin over your back.
---
Comes with the battlechest!
---
By chance do you raid in BFA and also have done Naxx? Are there literally any mechanics that are *hard* compared to a fight like Jaina? I've only raided in BFA so I have no idea what to expect. A lot of my guildies are seriously downplaying the mechanical difficulty of vanilla raids
---
I am currently raiding on a private server - two nights a week - Thursday and Sundays. Very well manageable for me with a "real life setup" similiar to yours, I play a healer though. 
---
Most time outside of raids is either to farm gold to buy consumes or buy the consumes. If you want to raid, try to find out which consumables are necessary for your class and see what you can buy / farm early on. Some herbs / items will be cheap in the beginning and when everyone needs them, prices shoot up so much.
---
I'd totally want to avoid world pvp on an epic scale like this too. RP-PVE server for me too!
---
Down vote it, hide it, move on with your life.
---
It really is an amazing game.  Have fun exploring it for the first time!  I wish I could go back to that.
---
Then that's going to be some sick DPS if you need a Richter scale for it.
---
The Bag of Marbles from Elwynn (don‚Äôt remember which quest) is also handy.  Reduces the targets hit change by 25%.  Has 10 charges, I think.
---
You can mind control people through the BG portal and make your enemies force-quit.
---
&gt; 1 sunder/revenge is usually enough for each mob
---
Small issue with this is that it can depend on last time you got a revenge/sunder rank, whereas the damage done by heroic strike is going to be more consistent (while the bonus threat may not be, but the damage plus 10% threat from d-stance smooths it out).
---
&gt;I actually do keep aggro reliably the way I play
---
Yeah I don't doubt that you do. I just like my way of threat-through-dps because it makes the groups overall damage higher if I'm holding threat by dps instead of sunder. Makes the dungeons faster, makes the mobs die faster so your healer doesn't go oom as much, etc.
---
&gt;I feel much safer with instant attacks instead of on-hit ones, especially on pull with trigger-happy DPS.
---
I usually pool a bit of rage before the mob dies so that I have enough to queue up a heroic strike as the mob runs to me on the next pull, effectively making it an instant attack anyways (so my very first attack on the mob would be a heroic strike).
---
&gt;But I don't have bloodrage up for every pull.
---
Yeah, I know, I'm just saying the ideal pull behavior. Sidenote about you mentioning Demo Shout too, it's somewhat worthless for threat unless theres 4-5 mobs or more. 3 it's not gonna give you enough threat to hold aggro off of the healer. Once you get to 4-5 mobs and the healer's heal aggro is being split between 5 mobs then you're okay. I tend to only use it for damage reduction if I need it, not for threat.
---
Again all this advice is how I tank while leveling, not at 60. Lots of stuff changes then.
---
Of course. But I had no idea I could use it on myself while soloing. 
---
Saves a lot of time after being killed in pvp when you are just trying to get somewhere
---
Asmongold? He wont hit the hype 50k + numbers but he does pretty well just fartin about in BFA
---
Yeah but they never will
---
One of the reasons Cata only went to 85 was because a lot of people didn't want the level cap raised at all and voiced this on the forums.  
---
I quit WoW in Cata and played Rift: Planes of Telara for two years, then Guild Wars 2 for another year or two before coming back in WoD.  I loved Guild Wars 2 for it's horizontal progression, Rift could have done something similar with adding new souls but they opted for vertical level cap increases as well and fell hard shortly after the first expansion.
---
&gt;PS, when guilds start killing nefarion. Try to figure out when they are doing this. If you can time being in Stormwind when a guild turns in the Head of Nefarion, you will get a 2 hour buff that increases your attack power by 120 and crit change by 5%(for melee, I forget what % it is for ranged.)  
---
&gt;This buff is ABSOLUTELY INSANE. You gotta think, at level 7, you're around 50 Attack Power as a rogue.. So adding 120 onto that? You just WRECK things... It becomes like playing current content wow. Things will still hit you like a truck, but you will annihilate these things before they can do much dmg to you at all.  
---
&gt;GET THIS BUFF AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN while leveling brand new toons through Elwynn Forest/Durotar!
---
Nefarian will only be implemented in phase 3. 
---
But Onyxia Buff will be available from the start of phase 1.
---
If you don't want to see people doing cool stuff in WoW Classic... why are you spending your time in a WoW Classic subreddit?
---
dw fury tank is the current meta until Naxx for EU and NA
---
The stress test servers are up for 24 hrs or so, just like last time. Blizz just wants as many as possible in the early window for max stress and so they can monitor while they are still at work. Should be able to play all evening. My guess the server will shut down 7pm EST Thursday. So may be able to sneak some play in after work then as well.
---
i.e. classic wow beta streams?  That's pretty much what it is to me..
---
The longer CC timers on things like poly, fear, sap, etc... complaining about normal PVP server behavior like getting camped or ganked... roll a pve server then, fool!   
---
I just mean that the player base innately ruins whatever they are given by complaining about their own special interests.  It's like developers just can't listen to it without bowing to demands.
---
No... 100k active players. And I know myself and probably millions of players will happily pay a wow submit classic, you are in fact the first idiot I‚Äôve seen complaining about it.
---
Tbh the leggos system would have been fine if the drop was a token that could be exchanged for any legendary of your choice. They really messed up balance with the rng aspect.
---
Being a good game.
---
While playing the beta you see people running around with alchemy buffs. Everyone buffing each other and using the random spirit and armor scrolls that drop off mobs.
---
Thrall as warchief and Sylvanas not being crazy.
---
This is what they should do. World of Warcraft 2. A fresh start with modern models and graphics but with WoW classic philosophies.
---
Added :)
---
Do you really think asmongold is paying people to promote his stream here?
---
He doesn't need promotion, he is the most popular wow streamer right now.
---
what did they do
---
Fair enough. I didnt play my druid until tbc came out.
---
Seems odd to me that you would shift out to auto attack but I'll take your word for it.
---
You have to be active at least = read chat, being polite and describe your character
---
You don't push a button and wait the game to do it for you. You don't even need to talk once even in dungeon.
---
semantics\*
---
The entried are just examples.
---
You can usually tell if people are talking about deadmine or dire maul because diremaul is accompanied by a wing indicator (ex DM N)
---
They face rolled way before getting bis
---
Battle for Hillsbrad is quite iconic. Genocide, terror tactics, pillaging, mutilating the dead for trophies, developing chemical weapons and other fun activities.
---
I only had mining and i used to respec between raids a lot so it took most of my gold but i guess big factor that i was beeing a pretty uncontested farming so it was actually very good and prices were high on my server. Obviously its bad with more competition and prices beeing down it could've been very different but it funded me very well. Made me sick looking back after few years and seeing alt bank still full of that stuff :D. Should've helped someone before quiting.
---
Hayven, probably.
---
It is a bug. I used to kite that dragon to the throne room in Vanilla and Bolvar would wreck him quickly.
---
Ok... well, if you're not willing to play a "sub-optimal" race/class combo, you won't play Gnome, AND you dont want to heal, here are your options given your restrictions:
---
Dwarf Hunter 
---
Nelf Hunter 
---
Good luck.
---
Hunter quivers are broken so you have to remove them for autoshot to work  
---
Beastmaster armor talent drops off the pet after about 10 minutes  
---
If you melee an attacking mob then send pet in, pet wil go passive when you move  
---
If first mob dies while pet is travelling to second mob, pet will go passive and return to you  
---
and so on
---
If the healer is a shaman, priest or paladin yes. If your healer is a Druid, use the SS on the shaman, priest or paladin in your group
---
Actually beautiful AngelThump
---
Doesn't this prove that RP-PVP can succeed in regular PVP servers though? This is wicked stuff though.
---
Thanks to them they helped blizzard identify a bug with stoneskin totem. Thanks 'damage value people' for actually fixing bugs and not just talking shit on reddit.
---
Is a dwarf / nelf hunter stronger then a human mage for pvp?
---
This wasn't a thing in vanilla, the mob would immediately rotate always facing aggro target.
---
Spaceships literally started in the first expansion.
---
I need to save my money. The going rate for hookers these days is simply too much. I've definitely looked into it though lol
---
It‚Äôs 15. So Canadians are getting overcharged? What a surprise.
---
Fair point, OSRS is non existant on twitch for example, same with FFXIV
---
I think allowing streamers clips turns r/classicwow into pretty much a repeat of r/livestreamfails which for the longest time was basically r/iceposidonclips
---
I find after adding asmond and esfand to my filtered posts the sub has felt a lot less like a second  promotional platform for those 2 streamers and a lot less obnoxious.
---
All of these comments are exactly why I posted this. Fun discussion about stuff that's fun to think about.
---
No love for shadowpriests I see
---
Asmonbald :) 
---
Thank you for this, I will use it to plan my alts.
---
There was a great suggestion last night about adding flair/tag requirements to posts. That way people can just see what they want. I also want nothing to do with streamer posts.
---
QuestHelper is a QoL addon but it's really optionnal since it's affect only you
---
But addons like KTM + DBM are gonna be essential this is where you could complain. 
---
You won't be able to get into a raid without thoses addons who are crushing the remaining difficulty of raids by displaying information that aren't natively in the game.
---
Hit it like you mean it
---
Implying the developers do not watch streams or vods of their own beta for evidence of a bug.
---
You're the idiot here buddy.
---
Damn...  googling now.
---
I'm not even signed up for the beta mate haha, who's projecting now...
---
From what I understand it's possible to reach armour cap on a bear even before AQ, at that point crushing blows and crits aren't that scary. According to everything I've seen and read bears have become meta because you're dealing with speed runs. Avoidance and defense become much less important because fights don't last as long and the main thing is threat generation. 
---
Bears generate excellent threat, only exceeded by dual wielding Fury/Prot warriors in a full threat set. But I don't have firsthand experience.
---
Ouch, I forgot about that. There's going to be so many twinks in low level BGs when it comes out, it won't even be worth trying out.
---
So you **are** willing to play a sub optimal combo? Because you'll always be a step behind Gnome Mages who will have *slightly* more crit and and CD to remove novas, roots, etc.
---
I literally said that he wasn't doing DPS because of the game mechanics, so  he should have swapped over to an off heal and buff role fully to contribute more.
---
My point was in fact that ESFAND focusing to much on DPS was hindering them...
---
That is an amazing book! I have it on my Audible too.. I'm trying to decide on another Warcraft book now...
---
Warrior tank and hunter make the best raid leaders IMO. I think that‚Äôs the traditional position as well.
---
I'm hoping he looks at a continuous ream of paper and yells: GREAT SCOTT.
---
No, but I have seen the guides and fights on videos. Vanilla have a few mechanically challenging raids _but_ imo the difficulty comes differently. Like you have to be able to coordinate 40 people to do simple-ish things. Which can be much much harder than getting 20 people to do medium difficulty things. Theres nothing compared to Jaina or KJ, because the tech just wasnt there.
---
I prefer to use them. I am not a power leveler but I am lazy, leveled so many times in vanilla without so I will do it with help this time
---
If human mage is stronger then a dwarf/nelf hunter in pvp i would play it. Is it?
---
Actually, that's not true. Any tanks who still wanted to min max in bc still ran MC for Thunderfury because it was still bis threat generation for a bit, till it was nerfed. +30 hit scopes, which the pattern dropped from MC. I think even Naxx shoulder enchants were better than the faction ones from Shattrath.
---
&gt; so few tanks in classic.
---
Most raids will only require 2 tanks, about 1 healer a party and the rest, 20+ DPS.
---
Supply and demand. Tanks are in need until you have 2-3 that you can rely on. AFter that you're not recruiting more, you're likely gearing up your Warriors to tank when the day comes that you need them to.
---
Whereas with DPS, you need so many you can always get a few more.
---
You're forgetting the OBVIOUS fun involved in right click each player name in your chat box to find out what class they are playing!
---
I doubt they will because then they dont have their own army of fanatics to control the server, but I'm pretty much in the same boat. I hope every top streamer pics the same realm so I know which one to avoid.
---
As an adult literally sitting in an office I need to say that stick and racoon game makes me feel damn excited.
---
PSA to all healers, you can heal yourself
---
Open to anyone with a sub would make sense, and would be nice. They won't do a completely open beta, they want that $15 from tourists.
---
Nice!
---
The game will have add ons. The game will be better because add ons are present. I look forward to using weakauras and the LFG addon tool for grouping.

That‚Äôs what I was trying to get at as well
---
At some point yes you will have to merge the layers together as the consistent population of a realm peters out, but this should only happen maybe once a week or less.  They have also said there will be a consistent number of layers which will be decreased over time.
---
What did yall get? 
---
Commander
---
ENTJ-A
---
I got this and i usually play healer
---
What is the letter combination there for?
---
I could have sworn someone tried something similar during regular vanilla and got into the 20s. It was hell though because you have no movement increases or mounts yet.
---
This made me lol

I'm sure classic betas great.
---
I'd be hesitant to trust preach currently as I imagine he is trying to get back into blizzard good books.
---
This is part of why ive decided to not rush things too much.  I work too much to really 'keep up' and wont have the time to push content on a cutting edge level, so it doesnt really matter if im a bit behind.
---
Taking a bit longer to get to 60 but enjoying the journey a bit more along the way sounds like more fun to me, anyways.  I completely understand people that want to rush (i did that for several xpacs in the past on retail), but at this point in my life its just not for me.
---
Considering I don't like watching streams and care less about streamer personalities there ends up a lot of posts that I skim over recently.
---
Uhh the Draenei are Exiles/Refugees of the Legion. No other race or group has spaceships. 
---
So unless the Draenei are suddenly gonna crash into Azeroth again, I doubt we will see spaceships again till we get Legion 2 electric boogaloo. 
---
Though I honestly loved how they were handled in Legion. Warping in above us during the invasions, beaming down portals, we have to fly up to the ships and kill the people on board. And then the raid where we fight on a capital ship while everything is demonic and alien.
---
Well that really doesn't answer the Devastating Blow problem, which earlier has been THE reason you wouldn't bring a druid.
---
Im subbed still simply for pet battles.... Maybe I need help....
---
i wasn't implying that at all, but the proper way of bug reporting is to use the tool. if you want to make sure the bug will be seen by a dev then thats the way to do it, and skipping over it because it will stop you from clearing content which was cleared 15 years ago isn't' a good reason.
---
&gt;Below is a clip of me getting sharded mid combat, and mobs spawning all around me.
---
This isn't supposed to happen, report it.
---
Once you create a char, it gets put in a Layer. Think of it like a mini server, that encapsulates a big chunk of what will be the final server when layers are gone.
---
You don't leave this layer unless you group with players from another layer. After a few weeks/days/whatever they'll remove layers.
---
My point was not to remove him, nor to make him solo heal. My point was that he should have ditched the STR gear for Int/Spi and +Heal gear.
---
Because of glancing blows this wouldn't have effected his DPS much and he would have been better at that Support Class role...
---
Again with so many people in here not actually reading the posts they respond to.
---
the feels when you miss the Ony buff because your'e too far into the AH
---
We're talking about the [manual group finder](http://i.imgur.com/kRwuilB.png), not the automatic looking for dungeon/raid tool.
---
The MT won't even be prot spec for long. Once the they have enough gear, the'll go Fury/Defiance to keep up with raid threat. This still affords you last stand and imp. shield block for fights you need it.
---
The reason every tank should take the neck is for the +hit. There aren't any other neck options that give you +hit until Nef. Even then you'd be taking it from a hunter/rogue.
---
Tanks need to have enough hit to land all their yellows at a minimum. Extra hit on top of that = more damage = more rage = more threat.
---
Tanks won't even be using Styleen's except on fights like Broodlord, Chromag and Twins.
---
&gt;Sidenote about you mentioning Demo Shout too, it's somewhat worthless for threat unless theres 4-5 mobs or more. 3 it's not gonna give you enough threat to hold aggro off of the healer. Once you get to 4-5 mobs and the healer's heal aggro is being split between 5 mobs then you're okay. I tend to only use it for damage reduction if I need it, not for threat.
---
Yeah, there isn't really an issue at all with AoE threat unless there are 4-5 mobs. But it at least puts some aggro on each mob (similar to bloodrage and battle shout), so the healer don't gain aggro for example. And since it also is a somewhat useful debuff I think it's often worth it, even if it isn't the greatest threat per rage or whatever. Apparently on classic battle shout doesn't give you threat when you refresh it, only on a new application, which increases the value of demo shout quite a lot, especially when bloodrage is on cooldown. 
---
&gt;Again all this advice is how I tank while leveling, not at 60. Lots of stuff changes then.
---
Yeah, thanks for the advice, definitely some stuff I will try out more when I get into the game.
---
150ms was very good for Vanilla WoW, probably less than 20% of players had better. I was probably 200-300 most of the time, never had these kinds of issues.
---
If you can run BFA, you can run Classic.
---
&gt;So again, irrelevant. An argument could be made that devotion aura has a similar bug possibly but it has been shown to not be the case yet.
---
Devotion aura? That doesn't do what stoneskin does. Devotion aura gives you armour and is quite visible on your player screen.
---
He's saying there are bugs in the beta, and there are.  You're talking about the test client blizzard set up.
---
It‚Äôs the lowest level where you get enough tools to somewhat control a fight, at least as a paladin.
---
Or just get someone that respects what your interests are?  My GF doesn't play games at all, but she never complains when I play games myself.  She knows WoW Classic is coming out and is excited for me.  She'd never play it or even try it, but that's not a bad thing.
---
Even now, I know a guy on [redacted server] who basically hit like level 45 and then chilled out hardcore and did profession stuff/auction house/very slowly leveled off grinding while fishing. This playstyle is preferable to him by far, and by the time he hit level 60 (which was like 2 weeks before BWL patch) he had thousands of gold, instantly had an insane set of gear from grinding 5 mans/2 weeks of MC with a guild who knew him and barely needed anything so he got funneled, etc. He was basically caught up gear-wise to the average raider, had an insane bank value compared to almost everyone else, and still got to level in his own weird way.

Try a warlock lol
---
What are you defining as "stronger"? both a great at PvP. Do you mean a 1v1 between a mage and a hunter or overall performance in wPvp, or BGs? Neither class is a bad choice.
---
Hey, I was tanking as a shaman up until the 60 raid content. It is doable if you're smart with your pulls and CC.
---
Honestly I would prefer a Classic that stopped after MC. Not gonna fly with the progression crowd obviously but that would be so cool as a server option. Or if they reworked the BWL/AQ/Naxx difficulty and gear stats so they were all the same ilvl as MC, just with different combinations of stats. That would contribute immensely to the "longevity at 60" factor.
---
I can sea that.

Okay I hope imgur handles files that big. I will try tonight.

---
&gt; People always say to level first aid and not to worry about any other professions, but I strongly disagree. I always level cooking
---
As a Hunter I can tell you right off that Cooking will help immensely when your pet is hungry. It allows you to raise the 'level' of meat you find from animals, thus letting you use said meat for longer. ( Pets that eat sub levelled food gain almost no happiness )
---
Honestly getting sick of seeing streamer posts. I give 2 shits what asmonwhatever and all the others do in beta
---
Can't get most people to tank in overwatch either lol
---
I know everyone is excited for Classic. But I was just on retail and I saw another night elf leveling in the starting zone. I asked if they wanted to group, they did, and we completed all of teldrassil together.
---
Reflexively hating modern world of warcraft because it fuels your hype for classic is a bad idea.
---
I've been unsubbed since October 2018. I opt'd into beta and re-subbed on the 15th of May, got a beta invite 2 days later...
---
1. Get an addon like Outfitter that will swap gear with one button press.  As you level, you'll only need a 1h+shield to swap.  Always keep them with you b/c you'll encounter some quest mobs that need their cast interrupted with Shield Bash.
---
2. Not always, but it is in your best interest to tank since you can dictate the terms of the dungeon run.  
---
3. Priest for heals and buffs and mana regeneration which will reduce the time you have to sit and eat or bandage, then Mage for crowd-control and food and portals.  Food is very expensive as you level and portals save you a huge amount of travel time.  
---
4. The most common mistake is pulling too many mobs at once.  You will usually only pull one at a time.  Having good situational awareness is a must for all classes, but especially so for Warriors since they do not have good crowd control tools.  The second most common mistake is not kiting a mob that needs to be kited.  If a mob has a much higher attack speed than you, hamstring it and rend it.  Then run out of melee range for a tick of rend, then back in.  You can also use a SwingTimer addon to help judge this.
---
5. Stance dancing applies to all warriors in every spec.  As fury, you will need to Stance Dance (that is: quickly swap to another stance) to Defensive Stance and equip a 1h+ Shield to interrupt a mob's spell cast with Shield Bash.  You will swap to Battle Stance to Charge into combat to generate rage or to simply move a little faster around the world, or swap to Overpower a mob when it dodges one of your attacks.  Overpower is a big dps increase, so you almost always want to use it when it procs.
---
6. You will switch to Defensive Stance anytime you are taking too much damage and need to use Shield Block.  You will also swap EVERYTIME you pull aggro off the tank in a raid.  You swap and stop attacking.  This will let you take less damage from the raid mob and give the tank more time to get aggro back. You stop attacking b/c you get a threat bonus in defensive stance.  You will sometimes swap to defensive if the off tank dies and you need to become the new offtank, but that is usually something you'll learn about much later in your gaming experience.  You will never tank as fury in berserker stance unless you vastly outgear the content you are running.  
---
7.  Yes, they are in demand.  BUT only very well-geared fury warriors.  They are, in fact, the most gear dependent of all the Classic WoW archetypes.  Your goal is to have gear good enough to push white hits off the hit table.  [https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-fury-warrior-guide/](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-fury-warrior-guide/) is a great resource for beginners.
---
8.  Generally, assuming equal skill, Classic PVP is decided by your gear and the other person's gear.  As a warrior, you want to use this stat priority: Hit to 5%, then Stamina, then Crit, then Armor, then Strength.  Use plate armor, a 2H with the highest damage, and swap to a very fast 1H with a high armor Shield when you need to use Shield Bash or soak a large hit (Ambush for example).  Best in slot items are items that increase weapon skill and items that give you extra attacks (Hand of Justice, Ironfoe, etc.).  To win, you must be able to burst your opponent down before they can escape and crowd-control you.
---
I bet the kids spamming ‚Äúomegalul‚Äù are just as fun
---
I will mainly be doing wpvp &amp; 1v1s. Ngs i like to. From what i understand a human mage is better overall then any hunter no matter the race in those situations?
---
Gotcha.
---
Jesus Christ, this is arguably one of the #1 killers of WoW's culture and put us where we are today. Realm / Faction / Race change services are right up there with LFD / LFR. I'm not a #nochanges guy but ffs.
---
Absolute best case scenario if it were to be added would be there's a 6 month cooldown the way it was in 2006. You are responsible for making your community and being a part of it on a realm basis in Vanilla. You don't just get to "jump ship".
---
&gt;The truth is WoW has catered to a small but very loud whining minority for years.
---
 I'm sure that sentiment is said by both classic and retail camps
---
Most places in the EU don't have air-conditioning.
---
Hunter is Heal because our DPS sucks feelsbadman
---
Ah, so they are meta for people that have the raids on farm and know them well. So not for the common player I guess.
---
I hope you get banned. Just learn to deal with it like everyone else instead of being a lazy gold-buying bitch
---
Original was just a 10(?) day trial. Not sure if there was a level restriction.
---
How very odd
---
Any tiger/panther in stv drops a bristly whisker, which stacks to 5 and sells for 30-50 silver a stack if I recall correctly. Grinded those for my mount money on a pserver a while back
---
I disagree, for the next 90 days at least. Let the art, battle stations, and tattoos stay while 100k+ salivate in anticipation. We can talk about blocking those posts when we finally get content from Classic players playing Classic.
---
&gt; not everyone like to watch streamers
---
Not everyone likes memes either but I don't post a thread whining about every meme post that hits the front page and invent some conspiracy that someone is trying to profit from it like you are with streamers.
---
You're being irrational; this subreddit caters to a lot of people. Some people like some types of content, other people like other types of content. Deal with it.
---
Its unusual in MMOs to give players a self rez. Many people who have not playef wow before may assume soulstones can only be used on others.
---
I like the basic idea as well. This would allow for a reset of progression within the new content, essentially replacing all gear without affecting what was gained at the previous "expac/elemental plane".
---
More than just gear management would be needed though. I don't think a system could be made well enough to fix the issue that my bank requires 50+ items for each of the 6+ expansions.
---
Guild wars 1 split theirs expansions up entirely such that characters made in base game was not available in expac 1. New expansion = new char.
---
Obviously this has the con of you being unable to play the character unless you Play through old content that you are "done" with.
---
&gt; his is what client side movement prediction on 150+ms ping looks like. There is nothing to look at.
---
I've played plenty games at 150+ and it was never this bad dude.
---
You‚Äôre assuming I actually have it narrowed down to one class!
---
\*use it on the resto druid\*
---
Whoa, that's stark. I think the ongoing longevity of OSRS is still evidence that Classic-like modes can hold the attention of "modern" players, though. (This being a counterpoint to the general "nah, players can't actually live without 'conveniences' these days" point.)
---
Just imagine a streamer getting 100k viewers running a lvl 18 dungeon and you people acting like it isn't a big deal for vanilla just because you don't like it
---
The thing that makes it feel bad is, you're leveling but you aren't gaining anything but access to raids and dungeons. No new skills are added anymore. Sure, with BFA they added the Azerite gear but still 2-3 new spells / skills per class could have went a long way with refreshing the game.
---
I know that, but how did it end up in stormwind when. They were kiting it to undercity
---
Yes but bandwagon hate is easier then having an adult discussion.
---
Hence, "When guilds start killing" :D
---
Noobmaster69, what a typical rogue name.
---
Which is so stupid. I played BFA when it came out und stopped right about when the raid released. Now that I'm hyped for classic I wanted to play again but the first raid is already kinda pointless. I can easily get my gear elsewhere as it seems and then go into the next raid. I don't want to skip content, I want to progress through content.
---
Hell, I never even saw half the raids of Classic but it didn't matter.
---
I have the feeling that leveling cooking is much easier for Alliance than Horde. Never played Alliance much, but when I look up what I can use ingredients for, it's almost always used used for recipes learnt from a guy in Stormwind, whereas Horde is forced to search through Desolace for the same recipes.
---
Noooooooo!! This is one area that killed my enthusiasm to keep leveling. So desolate and so many fights with Horde..
---
Rotating expansions? Holy shit this sub has some bad advice, but this takes the cake for the time being.
---
Thanks for your perspective. Yeah I have no horse in this race, I just think OSRS is a solid counterexample to the "nuh uh, classic modes have no longevity in 2019" stance.
---
I have never lvled cooking past like 50, don't rate the 5 stat bonus for hours of fishing/cooking to get to the point anything I make is useful. healing/mana Potions you get all the time off chests, quests, and random drop, I just save them for an oh shit moment. 
---
&gt;Well, early on in Elwynn you get a 5 use item that lets you reduce the armor of your target by 50%. That's quite a lot of armor shredded off of a target, so USE IT! (Wisely of course. Pick and choose when you will use these 5 charges, but don't just let them sit there and never get used!) 
---
I save these items for later as well for PvP. 
---
&gt; PS, when guilds start killing nefarion. Try to figure out when they are doing this. If you can time being in Stormwind when a guild turns in the Head of Nefarion, you will get a 2 hour buff that increases your attack power by 120 and crit change by 5%(for melee, I forget what % it is for ranged.)  
---
The buff for turning in Onyxia's head too
---
This sub is practically r/watchasmondgoldplayclassicwowbeta
---
They really need to make all the dungeons scale gear to the current heroic level dungeons.  And make previous raids, raid finder level gear.  So there is a reason to run old content.  Put all that crap in looking for group finder.
---
Honestly it really depends on your professions.
---
I'll be going Herb/Alch for my first professions and you make SO much gold with those profs.
---
cooking and first aid help while leveling. other professions slow you down.
---
they can help, but they almost always cost more time than they save.
---
Regardless of how popular Classic turns out to be, you're delusional if you think retail is in trouble. It will always be the Golden child.
---
Lol I‚Äôll just buy blizzard tokens. 
---
And this is how it‚Äôs always been. There is nothing lazy about being efficient with my time. Have fun getting camped be me while you try and farm in winterspring noob.
---
Interesting, thanks for the context. I have always thought that classic WoW would only appeal to a fairly small niche after 3-6 months. It will be really interesting to see whether Blizz add new (divergent) content or stick to the historic release arc.
---
too bad you're not playing tbc, you'd be able to use the seismometer to catch the fel reaver sneaking up on you
---
Sorry but I‚Äôve got no Interest in playing with baldmongold and his Zerg following him around 24/7.
---
I had already bought BFA after buying Legion. I‚Äôm lv 115 and it‚Äôs not a great experience TBH. Hopefully things will shape up when I can run some dungeons etc. By then Classic will be on us and BFA will be in the recycle probably.
---
Yep, you actually have to make decisions, not just glide through mindlessly.
---
It does have a slow cook mode...
---
***DESTROYED***
---
You do not shift out to auto attack, you shift out because you need to cast an instant spell or something similar, and then do a melee attack with your actual weapon at the same time.
---
I'd suggest not resubbung at all if that's your mentality xD
---
Yea, it's what I game for, To lose my self in a different world after a hard day at work. But I'm a very visual guy, always been a visual learner, I'm very good with colour's, great at decorating but that seems to make me more sensitive to graphics seems once I see better the worse seems alot worse and graphics is a large part of my immursion. That's just how it is. I'd love to replay need for speed 2 and enjoy it or golden eye but I just can't.
---
I can't play Pandaran because of the shoulder clipping, can't play blood elf because the tabard clips in the crotch and can't have showing cloaks with back mounted weapons. It is what it is.
---
Just play a pserver to scratch the itch. It worked for me. Got to lvl 24 and now I'm pretty content until launch. Not trying to push it so as to not burn out.
---
I‚Äôm confused by your question. They wanted to kill it but he has an ability that heals him based on the amount of people near him making him unbeatable in beta. So they kited him to stormwind so Bolvar could help kill him, Bolvar didn‚Äôt for some reason so they decided to take him to UC so the horde would have to deal with him but they got caught up here
---
&gt;The issue is raising the power of items
---
How would one go about creating a an MMO like wow without constantly adding higher ilvls to the game?
---
I think very few players would continue to play if there wasn't a next-step to pursue.
---
Unfortunately invalidation of old gear seems unavoidable if you want to keep the game alive.
---
I do wonder where the "sharding is fine guys don't worry" post went, showing the exploitability of layering.
---
Both Bunker and Control have rooms like this!
---
This is the consequence of making mythic+ dungeons time based.  It's conditioned everyone to run everything as fast as they can for more loot.
---
It‚Äôs starting to get stale, when I come to this sub I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm in a asmongold circle jerk subreddit, I can‚Äôt scroll down without seeing a video from asmongolds stream. 
---
It can‚Äôt be so hard to believe that out of the 100k people that frequent this reddit that a good portion probably don‚Äôt want to be bombarded by streamers and are looking for some good discussion instead. 
---
If I‚Äôm looking for that content there‚Äôs plenty of places I can go to find it with very little effort, maybe if these videos are being posted there could be some discussion built around them from the poster instead of ‚ÄúAMONSGOL WORLD FIRST???????? YOU WONT BELIEBE HIS REACTION!!!‚Äù
---
You sure do watch his stream a lot for someone who dislikes him.
---
Do you understand how silly you sound accusing someone else of being bitter in the very same thread that you created to whine incessantly about how much you don't like streamers playing WoW Classic?
---
Seriously, I want you to reflect on this for a moment.
---
Wahhhhh wahhhhhh the big bad mean streamer videos are making me upset wahhhhhhhhh. üò≠üò≠
---
I honestly don't remember wiping much when doing guild runs in vanilla (former EQ guildies).  Only fight I really remember wiping on was last boss in Uldaman due to being underleveled, and wipes in gnomer due to aggroing things below walkway on the way to thermaplugg(which seems to not happen in beta despite people standing almost right on the edge).  Leveling dungeons were usually pretty easy even with weird class comps and slightly underleveled groups.
---
He's definitely roleplaying to a legitimate extent to where the word is deff applicable
---
I used to farm DM with a dps warrior MT, and it wasn't bad at all. Actually it might have been better than prot warrior for farming runs because the damage and threat generation seemed to be higher. (caveat: I know nothing about warriors. I was just the scrub keeping him alive).
---
I think he's referring to that guy.. uhhh what's his name...
---
The Ass-mangled?
---
Oh so they tried taking it to stormwind first then moved on to UC?
---
The amount of quest items you pick up in Westfall is a nightmare.
---
The problem with Spriest in bg‚Äôs and organized pvp is mostly mana issues. Your spells cost a lot of mana, so you‚Äôll go oom on your own before long. This plus if the enemies are organized all their hunters will just use their mana drain sting on you and you‚Äôll oom super fast
---
Both have near infinite skill cap that you won't reach, so this isn't a good question. I'd say hunter is the safee pick in that you can do well vs casters at least with mediocre gear. NE and dwarf are situationally tied (dwarf better vs warrior rogue, NE has more tricks with shadowmeld)
---
At the beginning it will be like SWTOR. Popular, full servers, lots of players. It comes free with the subscription so many will just try it out.
---
But then people will realize that it was a lot of work and grinding and many will go back to their easy game.
---
I'm not saying it will fail like SWTOR, because it likely won't. Just that the initial burst will be a lot like that.
---
It's my opinion that a game should show you what it's about from the first moment, not after a few hours.
---
I like it to a point, when a quest points to a moonwell in an area where there are two but one dosent work for no apparent reason and the quest has no mention to which you should go, that pisses me off. But you only run into a few of these along the way
---
Nowadays you rarely ever use the automated group finde, if you're a somewhat decent player.
---
Yea it's nice to see people working together. Even throwing up a buff on someone is a big help during Vanilla. Sucks when a pally runs past me(a rogue) and doesn't hook up the might haha!
---
Looks like Classic WoW is really gonna suffer and miss such a Sally sensitive person such as yourself. Good riddance.
---
I‚Äôve been to party‚Äôs like that.
---
This is never going to get a serious answer lmao. bUt mY pRiVaTe sErVer, as if they're ever perfectly scripted to vanilla's specifics. Bear tanks in vanilla were a huge meme since there's effectively zero leather with defense on it to stop crits and crushing blows.
---
Personally i like to cook everything seperate. But there are soke
---
Dishes that cook everything all together. And cooking chicken and potatoes together can also be really easy. Sometimes i just cook rice in it and stir fry some veggies and chicken in a pan. Its really just a QoL boost.
---
There's a difference between stoicism and machismo.
---
Is it preferable to have a super easy lvling experience all throughout e.g. cats if you had the best gear from Wrath? Or should new players be forced to raid arthas before being able to quest In cata?
---
The difficulty lvl of questing has to be set for either of these cases, agreed?
---
That must've been rough!
---
&gt; You might get into a situation where you have to take down an elite that has a non-elite mob or two next to it.
---
Elite with two adds, sounds like something a lil' healing potion would fix.
---
Thanks!
---
I did enjoy legacy of blood.
---
I don't even have to farm because I won't need respecs.
---
Have fun spending real money on imaginary in-game currency, idiot.
---
Pretty sure getting 'melted' is a common phrase used in gaming, at least among circles that I have played in, whenever you get nuked by a caster.
---
I think the Onyxia buff is only for Horde
---
Desolace was my saving grace as NE Priest... STV was just far too dangerous for me then, especially since I leveled Disc/Holy.
---
Also got the gold I needed for my 40 mount there back then...
---
Not as common as people here make them out to be, but yes they were a thing.
---

LFR opened up raiding to people who were probably not raiding anyway, guild or not. I would say it's Flex raiding + the cross-server LFG system that opened up pugging to non-guilded people (like myself lately) who would otherwise need a guild to take on challenging content (not the face-roll of LFR).
---
It's not a previous harder version of the game. It's a different, unofficial game.
---
I literally remember this happening in classic, 15 years later... I quit before I even hit 70 on bc. This is the shit I loved. Pissed I'm missing out on beta...
---
Not sure I understand. 
---
Either you gear is also being squished, essentially making you gear worse (invalidating any progression youve made with the last X tiers),
---
Or the next/new tier doesn't actually making you stronger, and in this case what is your motivation to do it?
---
I had been 60 for a month or 2 before I realized you could scroll down the talent tree.
---
but what happens after Naxx?
---
The magic of Classic is there is no wrong way to do it.  Every level is an adventure unto itself.  There is nothing tying you down and restricting your play.  The zones are not linear, and you are free to explore and choose your own path.  It's about the journey not the destination.
---
Play with your friends, and suck it up.  
---
Or go to a new adventure and find new friends :)
---
All I know is my gut says maybe.
---
This is kind of what I was thinking. It's not strictly additional horizontal or vertical contents, it's both. The problem I see though is the feeling of losing your prior progression, even if you can still go back to prior content and still have it. Starting at a blank slate again would just feel like you lost something. Then again though, we kinda get that with new expansions anyways.
---
The only part of a greater solution I can think of is to do some of what Destiny does, where gear has specific effects meant to improve your character for that new content. For WoW it'd be those new levels that are tied only to a specific expansion, and as you gain them and gear within that expansion you'd get that feeling of character progression still. There'd be some crossover power progression between all of the expansions, like skills or general levels of things that could worked on anywhere (I think ESO has some stuff like this). 
---
With a system like this, all the content and progression of expansions would be pretty separated, while still giving players real reasons to go back and forth between all the content. One issue I can see though is having to collect multiple gear sets for each expansions, but I think there'd be some overlap of some sort.
---
From the comments in here, there seem to be a lot more introverts. Interesting. Expected.
---
Jesus, I didn‚Äôt know on pull you had 80 rage and tons of gcds to play with. Sometimes it‚Äôs just really better to charge and clap then swap
---
Hah
---
If it's going to be like retail, which I assume, there will be German, French, Portuguese, Russian, and Italian servers (might've missed one or two), but certainly not Danish or Swedish servers. What you might end up with is servers like Ravencrest on retail that is heavily populated by Danes, and you might see some Danish retardation in trade chat once in a while, and a fair amount of Danish guilds, but it's likely not going to be a problem for you at all. I've played with many people on Ravencrest through the years, and I've never met anyone who's ever had any real problems communicating with anyone on the server, even though they weren't Danish.
---
Yes it's worth playing, all good games are worth playing and vanilla wow is damn fucking good.
---
Same haha
---
Kinda sad the game isn't harder, tbh. I'm not a "nochanger" person, so I would be glad if they buffed the difficulty, but people claimed so fucking hard for the #nochanges bullshit that Blizzard incorporated it in their philosophy for Classic even in things that will actually lower the longevity of the game.
---
Yeah,nice tip, just 4Head learn LANGUAGE because you created a character in wow on a wrong server. This is some 300iq moves right there.
---
But you get horns in cat form! Come on man, a lion with bull horns!
---
90% of the time you will be in cat or bear form anyway.
---
That looks odd because of high latency/movement delay, enemy rogue is closer on his screen.
---
Reposting the same clip over and over? Yea moderate / remove that.
---
Streamer clips in general? That's fine. People like to watch the clips and discuss things.
---
Let me write an essay on layering
---
How are expansions made in FFXI and why wouldn't it work for wow :) ?
---
I just hope that the live team is learning from this beta. You can turn on a stream for 5 minutes and see all of the reasons why classic is better than live.
---
Rank 10, as a warrior on Horde side, damn that brown set is so sexy.
---
Its just the mind flay icon since it looks like it is melting someone's face off.  Though it wasn't until much later that they changed the targeting of the spell to actually attach the beam it the target's face.  In vanilla, it the beam just targets the body.
---
There is a chain quest that ends up there as an Elite Quest.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=1089](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=1089)
---
I think consistency is much more important. newer models would stand out amongst all the low quality world assets and doodads.
---
I can‚Äôt wait to tank again like I did when I was a kid.  Turtle shell shield was my shit.
---
Take my upvote my wise man.
---
Go tauren female and level in another zone maybe(to get another races mount)? Not sure how class quests would go tho.
---
These are from archive.org, have been out of print for 15 years. Original BradyGames isn't even around
---
The only one I‚Äôve read is Night of the Dragon and boy was it tough to get through and this is from someone who is reading through every book in the Star Wars EU (RIP). So, do they get any better?
---
One of the problems we ran into in vanilla was that a guild invests so much time and gold into gearing a tank. If that person leaves the guild, you're screwed.
---
imo that's one of the main reasons people prefer the raid MT to be in a leadership role of some variety. They are less likely to leave the guild they founded or are raid leader of.
---
We were a "tier 2" raiding guild, though, so we had problems with people getting poached by tier 1 guilds who were ahead of us. That's probably not an issue for tier 1 guilds.
---
1-20 is in my opinion too much/too many levels for a limited trial in Classic. 1-10 would be more appropriate. 1-5 would be more comparable in the value you get with a trial to the live game.
---
&gt;Asmond cleans says to his party and his stream of 50,000. "Good! don't report it."
---
Are you just pretending that you didn't understand this joke so you can fake being outraged on Reddit?
---
&gt;They did not report a bug to win a "world 1st race".
---
Did you watch the perspective of the Hunter?  Do you know if he reported the bug later after the dungeon? Do you think that a GM would have descended from the heavens and nerfed Hunter's Mark in that very instant if they had bug reported it during the race?
---
&gt;The streamers that have 25k plus viewers are not bug reporting unless it literally hinders their play at the time.
---
Yeah you're not really telling the truth here either. Asmongold and every other streamer I've watched have reported a bunch of bugs.
---
&gt;The final straw for me and Asmonds stream was when his buddy Mcconnel didnt get beta invite.
---
If you're this outraged by someone with connections and influence being granted a favor, you're really not going to enjoy real life.
---
Keep early weird consumes for random pvp goodness. 
---
Waste on pve is for retail scrubbers.
---
Rather see clips of streamers actually doing something in beta than these boomers complaining-threads.
---
Looks like you may have to compromise or not play with friends.
---
Just play what you want but outside of 1vs1 Spriests are considered low tier. Consider supporting instead or mage and warlock. 
---
Unfortunately rogue is also kinda low tier in premades. You should just play what you want and see how far that takes you.
---
35 is still millennial.
---
Or they will abuse the lock.
---
I will roll a warlock, but do not count on me playing taxi for you...
---
Remember when you and your anonymous adventurer friends killed Onyxia and turned her head in to be heralded as heroes?
---
Wrong, you don‚Äôt remember that. Onyxia was actually soloed by Varian Wrynn several years after we fucked off to fight other evils, thinking she was dead.
---
I play .2 femtoseconds per century, is it feasible for me to dual wield thunderfuries?
---
Might Helm with Defilers Shoulder Pads for a Warrior.  Otherwise, Judgment tier 2 helm and shoulders was dope.
---
Why do most people say mage is better then hunter then, and most ppl say mage is the safe pick?
---
We already have a model of this succeeding with Old School Runescape.  I would like to see classic wow go similar where features could be polled to go in. I wouldn't mind quality of life updates that wold make classic better. We don't necessarily have to add burning crusade, Wrath, etc. If its popular enough maybe we could get brand new content that adds good things and avoids the mistakes Wow took.
---
Did party members show on zone/world map? I honestly do not remember, though I think they did.
---
Can we get anything but this ugly mongoloid asmon. I hate his face
---
I'm sure BFA won't miss some LFR raider farming gold for assgold on classic.
---
Question isnt **if** Blizzard is gonna release new content or updates/changes, it's about **when**.
---
While there will be a lot of players enjoy the content and everything, there will be a point where there won't be anything new to do. The game will probably do fine for some year without updates or changes, but at certain point there will be changes made for the game to continue living.
---
Yes, lots of players kept playing private servers over and over, but imo that's a lot to do with there being new servers. It's fun to restart on fresh servers with fresh economy. The journey is usually the fun part, and it's usually fun when a lot of other players do it too.
---
Kinda like how Diablo 3 seasons is lots of fun for a while before you get bored and not play it again until another season.
---
This is why I retired from healing. I am not 16 anymore and do not care to move at break neck speeds or deal with stress of keeping up.  If I do not the tanks starts crying noob and leaves.  Noob...really...been gaming for 25 years and use to "raid" heal in many games.  At least call it like it is...maybe slow old man or poky.  At least that is accurate.
---
Meh it‚Äôs no different than you spending money on the subscription. My subscription is free because of selling keys and achievements for the past few expansions, so I don‚Äôt see the big deal with me spending some money to save me time so I can play this game the way I like.
---
This idea is probably flawed, but why not keep the level cap at 60 for all expansions? Instead of a higher level cap,  change expansions so you are leveling up talent trees that are only usable in the expansion zones, and these talent trees change depending on what content you access. That way all zones can remain somewhat challenging and relevant.
---
Ty
---
Do not think It's a bug, more like a Legion build vestige.
---
They should indeed attack any red target on sight, they will fix this I think, mass pvp capital raids were a big thing in Vanilla, hell soloing faction leaders were a thing in WOTLK for some achievement.
---
Alot of it is pretenting
---
Oh no, I feel another 26 hour flu coming on... 
---
I think it will start around noon on Wednesday. Better let my boss know I will be working from home again.
---
If you enjoy the time you spend playing he beta why does it matter if the character is wiped? What‚Äôs the point of people playing single player games if eventually they‚Äôre going to finish it and then potentially never play it again or lose their save? Because they enjoy the journey.
---
Idk still seems quite extreme some 100ms.
---
That doesn't just look odd. It looks completely terrible. If that's the way it is on their test server, they should flat out lie directly to our faces, and say it isn't. Would save the game from becoming a giant meme.
---
Im still thinking we need to recruit some kids. We need loot drama, it wouldnt be geniue classic experience without loot drama
---
Couple,\* BfA and Legion were relatively smooth, Legion particularly. WoD was a freaking mess of a launch.
---
Gonna be all over people with that First Aid prof.
---
You got me for 2 sec
---
If I won the actual Lottery, I'd still be playing classic, just in a nicer chair.
---
You will spend most of your time in a shapeshifted form. And you can still farm rep for a different mount type.
---
Playing with friends is better than anything.
---
Boo fucking hoo dude. I love how so many of you spergs whine about streamers. Get a new hobby asap.
---
Good luck buying tokens for Classic.
---
Zone was terrible. The quests sucked and the corpse runs were awful.
---
The first 4-6 hours no one will be able to play anyway, if it‚Äôs the same as the last stress test. :-P
---
Last night I was thinking about how we have spent more time in cata world/game model than the pre cata world. More time with dungeon finder than without. 
---
I was skeptical of classic because of how grindey it was. But I had forgotten how free and fun the game felt without dailies and lfr. The immersive experience was really on another level back in vanilla, tbc, and half of wotlk.
---
That bullshit have u ever see pudgy video on enhancement shaman ??  The thing is if constantly ask the sham to nightfall and switch totem ofc he will never  does  a decent dps. T2.5 give a lot of answer for hybrid, i know it's very far but make dps hybrid more viable.

Its complaints like this that brought us the blood elf plague. And now the horde look like a fashion show.
---
Bro I still remember communism in my country, im hardly a millenial
---
Yeah you can tank with this deep arms/fury build by putting on a shield and Def stance until 60.
---
Paladin, T2. The only armour set you need.
---
What about troll?
---
Downvote threads that you dont like. Like I did with this one. And accept that everyone doesnt agree with you.

---
Unless he is a druid and the tank is paladin. Than I would use it on the paladin. If he is smart enough to walk back before dying.
---
People seem to good over the fact that the reason people grouped in classic isn't necessarily because the content was hard. It was because respawn rates and drop rates were awful. You were basically forced to group if you wanted to level in the early zones because you needed to maximize your chances of getting a tag on as many moons as possible.
---
And let's not get started about the insanity of the named mobs and fifty people trying to kill one thing every ten minutes.
---
Classic wasn't all sunshine and rainbows.
---
At this point it becomes Preservation.
---
Paladins have really, really good abilities at level 8 compared to other classes. Bubble, stun, heals, and with some gold good armor and weapons.
---
"I'm gonna pretend like I don't know his name to really show how much I dislike him" Speaking of complaining, look at your cringe comment whining about some streamer because you and a handful of overs have some weird hate boner for him.
---
No, but they are pretty similar
---
Troll can‚Äôt be Druid...
---
For some people that's actually true.
---
Every time a new tier or xpac is released they could just squish your current items and equalize them with items from other old content. See my post below but I think it went over peoples heads...
---
The people in charge of classic are huge fans of classic. They aren't going to wreck their new baby.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJhX8amTi5E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJhX8amTi5E) these are a little better to get a general idea of the class, kargoz only really has leveling guides that are 40 min long.
---
Great feature man! A friend has one like that where you can type name and class, but I like the style of this one!
---
World Servers = Layers * Continents, but Continents is constant, so Layers and Servers are proportional and the difference can be ignored.
---
tl;dr: You're both equivalently right, since continents both correspond (in number of layers per) and entirely separate (creating 2 halves for each layer, with each half being a separate server).
---
Lmfao. You underestimate the power of me having no life! Back in the day there were plenty of people who did the same. Albeit not always two of the same class, just other characters in general. Probably because power leveling was a thing eventually, and I think the refer-a-friend was in place around that time too.
---
Yeah, we didn't bother with world buffs, since there was always some shitheads waiting to gank..
---
How did that have anything to do with what i wrote?  
---
You made the claim that only True men tanks.  
---
That sounds like machismo to me, not stoicism.
---
&gt;  Much of their damage is in long-duration DoT, and the opponent is feared or slowed or stunned while melting to death.
---
I don't see a connection to melting and SWP. It's MF, even the icon of the spell is a face melting, and the beam goes straight to the face.
---
Take it with somebody else. Self-report is sometimes inaccurate because we aren't always honest with ourselves.
---
MBTI is 100% junk science with some Forer effect throwin in to make it convincing, but it's still kinda fun.
---
I think its more likely that you don't see faction or race changes. Honestly the only thing I expect is realm transfers.
---
Minor beastslayer for that awesome red glow!
---
I changed my post. I was thinking shaman.
---
BfA had issues but was a solid launch. Legion was smooth as fuck. But ya of course WoD and D3 were disasters.
---
I once did a start to finish, every quest possible BRD run. It took 6 hours. That place is a raid instance.
---
I‚Äôve put so many hours into FFT. I also just realized I can probably start again on my chrome book.
---
But to your point, I had the opposite problem. I was so fixated on getting to the higher jobs that I‚Äôd stay in Mandalia Plains for weeks grinding out job levels and then play through the story with super over powered characters
---
Yawnnnnnnnnnn
---
i log into my lvl 71 main and chill in Goldshire for an hour a day.... never seen another soul
---
Oh no worries. :-)
---
Gnome is absolutely fine.  The only downside is 5 weapon skill at level 60 when wielding maces and swords in a PvE raid setting.  Which is a bit of a boost on DPS, not honestly not something you can‚Äôt overcome.
---
And gnome is actually a better choice for PvP due to escape artist racial and the human weapon skill bonus being completely irrelevant in that setting.
---
BiS = Best in Stats??
---
Humans will yield the highest DPS endgame, but the difference isn't that high. For a min-maxer it's a point to remember though.
---
Humans still have their stealth detection racial, so no free insignia, while gnomes have escape artist as a good anti cc tool. I'd never play a race I hate for a few percent of dps.
---
The offer is still there xD if you could do that then props to you!
---
ur pretty optimistic with the ‚Äûonce all melees have it‚Äú ^^ i mean its not like it drops every time
---
You could always roll a different class to play with your friends on horde, while having your own Druid alliance side. 
---
If you‚Äôre like me and really only have enough time for one character, then ask yourself what aspects of the Druid matter to you, and try a class that offers some of them. 
---
Just remember wow is a game that is more fun with friends. Chances are you won‚Äôt care too much about how you look while you are having fun with them.
---
We actually end up paying less than the US. It's 18.99 CAD with no tax, which works out to about 14.09 USD.
---
INFP Paladin.
---
Well first thing is it depends what it is you want to minmax. If you want to minmax pvp then gnome is the best choice.
---
As for pve, well at some points dagger is better than swords, depends so much on what raids are out, what the gear set up is. A fully bis AQ40 dagger rogue is gonna do more dps than a fully bis AQ40 sword rogue for example, but if you do the same for BWL then the sword wins. Obviously you can go human dagger rogue but you just don't.
---
Best In Slot, meaning the best piece of gear for that particular slot (helm, gloves etc) at that current time
---
And the reverse as well I'd say.
---
Honestly same goes for any class with the ability to tank.
---
5mans are 100% tankable by Paladins/Druids.
---
tanking is just max dpsing a threat bar ;D
---
For PVP Gnomes are fine, I prefer Dwarf as stoneform always feels useful in more situations but escape artist is a strong PVP talent. For PVE it makes no difference, humans are the best but no guild would refuse you a spot because of your race.
---
*vaguely patriotic orchestra swells in the background*
---
Please, do continue.
---
I highly recommend Alliance players to go and quest here. Also in Stonetalon peak there's a cave with Alliance friendly elites horde players got a few quests for. Perfect for well timed ganks to wipe a full group ;)
---
Can't wait to not get in!
---
Also I hope everyone that does has fun!
---
A lot of beta players are seasoned Vanilla players from private servers. Most dungeons are pretty easy as long as you don't try and run through it like retail WoW where every dungeon is a speed run. Most dungeon leaders will mark the targets right away so the mages know who to poly, rouges Sap etc
---
and this is a boring text post with 0 content
---
I host and play in Gilnean RP's all of the time and know a great many people there by sight of their characters.
---
Try going where the people are.
---
In PvP as a warrior you probably don't want to wear leather gear, right? A lot of the pre raid BiS is leather.  Also no hit in PvP?
---
Players gonna be there. Classic will be fun for a while, but months of repetition of the same stuff won't keep the masses hooked. Even if the the raiding is a breeze, gearing up sucks. Feels great to get stuff,  but it's still a long and tedious process. 
---
Best bet would be, that a massively successfull Classic changes the course of the development of Retail. Hopefully, somewhere better.
---
I don't see any posts in this thread indicating mage. Mages have ice blocks and polymorph, along with possible cool downs which give a lot of power to their 1v1 game. Hunters are going to have a lot easier time in world PvP and group bg. Probably overall too.
---
Precisely, if I wanted to watch streamers i would be on twitch, not reddit
---
This was literally the popular thing to do when I was playing in 2004-2005. People would level up to the cap of the first battleground, which I think was 30 and then BIS it.
---
Is setting up your own (offline) private server and playing vanilla (solo) legal?
---
PeOpLe Are On ReDdIt PoStInG tHrEaDs EvErYwHeRe
---
Most people in general say mage is better for all around pvp. Not talking about this thread.
---
Amen
---
I don't know, do you like getting restealths off in front of mages because they frost nova'd you right by a pillar, ran to the opposite side of the area, and then casted on you while you escape artist into LOS?
---
How about being able to go SF daggers spec end game and still keep up with a mage without imp sprint or prep? Let me tell you, it feels really good to 5 pt cold blood + eviscerate a mage that didn't expect you to pop out of their nova mid cast. It happens often. Way more often than when you'll use stoneform.
---
Not to mention you're hard as fuck to be frostshock kited by shamans. I can't remember the last time it happened honestly.
---
I was back and fourth between dwarf and gnome for months and I picked dwarf for a while but I couldn't justify losing escape artist for such a niche.
---
Escape artist still helps against warriors and rogues too, it'll still break crippling and hamstring for those easy bleed kites.
---
PvP? PvE? RP?
---
In RP and PvP (possibly also the combination of these) Gnomes are superior simply because being killed by a Gnome is the absolute worst thing that can happen to a horde.
---
Play whatever you want tbh.
---
KEEPING THIS POST SIR. *gives a firm handshake*
---
I remember trials back then were time based, not level based. I think vanilla at one point had game codes you could give your friends, can't recall if they were 7 days or 10 days of free time. I started with a 14 day code I bought at Wal Mart for $1.99.
---
I can't wrap my head around the idea, that realm transfer, which obviously should / would have  cooldown is ' right up there with LFD / LFR'. Who would even "jump ship" more than absolutely necessary, and pay for it too?
---
Hehehe
---
Walking into Arathi Highlands the very first time and seeing Fozruk. I have this memory of exploring the zone with some guildies and almost being running into him. We moved to the side and just watched him pass in awe.
---
You must have a shitty house
---
Things get janky towards the end of expansions when everyone is wearing full bis. Imagine two more tiers on top of Naxx it could get silly
---
This sub eats up any "/r/wow hates classic" narrative even though a large majority of that sub supports classic, and the all time top post is the classic announcement.
---
Okay, thanks! I wasn't *too* far off.
---
While gnome is fine, you could say dwarf is actually better in PvP
---
I think I remember the flags showing up after a decent amount of time, so someone couldn't just play hide and seek. but it was not right away.
---
There have been a few big changes in thinking since original vanilla. This is an open-ended question so I will answer broadly as well as I can.
---
1.  TPS
---
In vanilla tank gearing was over-defensive (for reasons I will talk about later) and raid dps overall was severely handicapped. In particular, dps warriors are capable of dealing some of the highest damage in the game but have no hard threat dump, so their potential was largely wasted and it wasn‚Äôt uncommon to see dps standing around doing nothing while waiting for the tank to churn out more threat. In this environment, every additional point of threat a tank can generate is equal to 1 added point of dps able to be delivered to the boss.
---
In general, threat per second has become more important to tanks than survivability. Tanks, especially horde tanks, need to be generating the most threat possible with the minimum necessary survivability. Some warriors are now tanking certain encounters without shields and are intentionally going under 440 defense in favor of other stats.
---
2. Healers
---
As I mentioned before - healers in vanilla made awful gearing choices along with everyone else and were dealing with bad internet and horrible graphics lag in raids even on higher end systems. Avoiding any spike damage in this situation is critical and led to the overly defensive tank meta. Healers today have more mana, more regen, better theorycraft, and can respond to spike damage relatively easily while delivering smooth, consistent healing.
---
3. Stigma
---
The stigma against Druid tanks, I think, came from the hyper-defensive tank meta in vanilla where avoiding crit/crush and stacking defensive stats was the rule. Even in vanilla warriors began realizing this was a mistake and started working in dps gear when they started rage-starving themselves. Vanilla tanks (or healers) felt they could never afford to take a damage spike, and this cost them a lot, and it led them to dismiss druids as unsuitable tanks. Some were still used due to the overall dearth of tanks, but they weren‚Äôt taken seriously.
---
4. The case for Druid tanking
---
The evolution of the meta has led many guilds on private servers to take a dedicated feral OT to raids. Some of the reasons are listed below.
---
Druid tanks properly using MCP put out extremely strong threat very early in the gearing cycle, allowing dps to go hard. This is especially important for horde guilds without access to Salvation. 
---
Druids work better as an off tank maintaining high levels of alternate threat due to one of their talents that provides rage from critical strikes. They can stay second on a threat list without getting hit.
---
Druids remove some gearing pressure from the multiple warriors in guilds competing for the same pieces (many of your dps warriors will still need tank gear). 
---
For more information about this you can find plenty on YouTube (I think Baron/Skarm are the most popular) talking about these issues.
---
Cooking is super strong, but I will say, it seems to take a TON of time and effort to keep it current as you level
---
Government about to ban classic due to apparent drastic health consequences
---
Lol have fun with all the retail gold.
---
You could say that (arguably) but he didn‚Äôt ask about dwarves.  He asked if Gnomes were viable, which they definitely are.
---
You need active sub to play it, not to get it.
---
It's a pity they didn't add a Hakkar "hard mode". The boss already gets tougher when you don't kill his followers. Just make him also drop better loot.
---
And because it's the best damn raid to ever be put into the game.
---
Which is funny, because it's followed by the worst damn raid to ever be put into the game.
---
fuck all that shit
---
RFK and green iron helm usually around late 20s.
---
It is realistic to assume that this behavior is unintended and there are ways to mitigate it before the actual release...three months from now.
---
But I am sure we both agree that they need to remove layering ASAP, and *Blizzard* agrees that it is the goal, with phase 2 being a limit rather than the goal (more likely a few weeks).
---
Nope.  I don't want to do the same quests over again after doing them in BETA and having progress wiped.  
---
Though, I've played on private servers enough times over the past 5 or 6 years to have a pretty clear idea of classic.  I might be a little biased because of that.  
---
If they launched actual Classic now I'd play it immediately, but I don't have a problem waiting 3 months either.
---
Sorry, PVE mainly or rather almost exclusively.
---
Why not?
---
I was surprised the first stress test wasn't level 10 cap. You can get to level 5 in like 30-40 mins. Level 10's like 3-4 hours.
---
Hope everyone gets to have some fun this time
---
Triggered I don't like your boyfriend? I guess I'm not allowed to express my opinion of a community leader being toxic and leading classic into a bad direction. Good luck playing with yourself. No one will miss you as well.
---
Yes chef!
---
This isn't because of any actual quest, there's just a ton of unoriginal people copying Verycoolguy running around with paladin twinks in Tiragarde Keep because of the Alliance friendly mobs there.
---
Cool story bro
---
It is going to be exactly like other video games released since sonic 2 (Sonic 2 set the industry standard of releasing games on Tuesdays with huge advertising budgets).  A couple weeks of hard core hype before and following release.  A few weeks after a new game takes the spot light and attention of the video game crowd and media outlets.  
---
Which that decline of attention and player base must be handled very carefully by the wow demographers.  If they do it right, servers will not feel either over populated or absent of players after the attention drops.
---
My point being, a lot of the player's re-sub for classic - not for BFA. Since it's not part of a BFA player base, how can the audience be split? 
---
At least me and my friends are only re-subbing for classic. Have no interest in retail - it needs to change too much for it to be a game I'm into. If I for some reason get bored of classic (not sure how that'll happen) then I'd likely just quit WoW altogether
---
Which would be kinda cool in Vanilla WoW. Instead of a TBC server just build upon Classic and add new post Naxx stuff.
---
&gt;And gnome is actually a better choice for PvP
---
But it's not true
---
You know, I don‚Äôt work in an office either, but... yea I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs about right.
---
Seriously do not worry about races it really doesn‚Äôt matter, if you get to naxx and keep wiping on KT it‚Äôs not because jimmy rolled a fucking human instead of dwarf, just play whatever the hell you want!
---
They still haven't really explained the limitations of layering, have they?
---
Can you jump around via friend invites without restrictions? Is there some form of cooldown?
---
The only thing I heard them say is, it would not be common to change a layer.
---
As far as I understood the tech, one layer equals the maximum playercount sustainable per realm, around 3000 players like the old servers then. 
---
So if they prolonge the layering due to high player activit (with good restrictions) it should not be really different once your in your layer compared to classic wow.
---
But they need to release more infos to be sure.
---
Idk, I don't live there.  Maybe because electricity is more expensive?
---
Ehhh I find tailoring for mages and locks to speed up lvling, as you get cloth automatically and the spell power on the early sets is nice. The Shadowcloth set falls right in line with a questing lul and you can farm your lvl mobs for the shadow silk you need w/o wasting grind time. 
---
Mining/Smelting, if you are able to get to silver/gold both of those sell quite well in ore form, people like to use those two to get over a mining/smelting lvl hump. This would considerably slow you down though. 
---
Skinning in general is very lucrative, its just a few more sec per kill for much more loot potential. Enchanting mats always sell for a load and the items come in automatically aswell or even from other crafting like tailoring ect.
---
I'm having more fun watching them play than myself playing on retail
---
ISFP - Alliance Priest reporting for duty.
---
I really like it! Have you seen the easter egg in-game in Dalaran from that book? (don't spoil what it is if you have)
---
Stay clear from Stormrage and War Crimes, they are subpar the other books imo.
---
Druids are better leveling tanks anyway
---
Meh, then I‚Äôll just do it the old fashioned way.
---
Life finds a way, trading retail gold etc.
---
Yeah I used to be a Preach fan and sub because of his cool legacy videos. But then he started railing against classic and I mean the guy still plays retail WoW to this day.
---
You give that cloak far too much credit, it doesn't have that type of insulation.
---
I mean, if you have no value on your time it's technically free. Roughly 90 minutes.
---
I‚Äôd pick gnome with escape artist over human in PvP for a Rogue every time.  Not sure what‚Äôs not true about it.
---
that‚Äôs why GW2 expansions work amazing, that i wish WoW had something similar. I would LOVE to go back to Pandaria and get as good and needed stuff there like from BFA, or just jump to whatever exp i want whenever i want
---
That was not in vanilla. I think it was in Wrath.
---
If you don‚Äôt finish the quest then yeah. Too bad you can only hit Lazy peons
---
Get new friends
---
Nope it's a really good gold sync in the game.
---
Surely you mean Randy Marsh...?
---
I can't remember who said it, but I think it's also the fact that a lot of the world is low poly, and low-res textures, the fact that your character also looks kind of crappy actually fits in. Which is an argument I can totally buy.
---
Then you don't understand the purpose of Reddit. Subreddits exist to aggregate all different forms of content on a specific topic into the same space. If you don't like *that specific* type of content, then don't consume it. But it's not up to you to dictate which content should be enjoyed by a few thousand other people.
---
You can always grab the opportunity by the horns and annoy your friends with udderly cheesy bull-bleep puns until they see red and give you your precious night elf just to stop your beef. 
---
Might backfire, but it behooves you to try.
---
&gt; Yeah, no kidding.
---
Are you being contrarian for the sake of it?  There isn't a single other 15 year old game you could PAY ME to play.  Vanilla wow is the most hyped gaming experience in the history of gaming.
---
Dunno, in my guild a hunter or two had it. We used DKP admittedly.
---
Better to give it to a veteran hunter than a new Warrior who might ditch.
---
Everyone needs to report it as a bug so they can fix it before launch.
---
Not 100% sure but I highly doubt it however, engineering skill would effect it. And yes, being gnome with +15 would make a difference.
---
It's a meme you fucking sperg. How do you know understand that?
---
The world doesn't have to be low res and crappy...
---
IRC isn't much of a thing today, there will probably be server discords.
---
Can't you do the hitting anymation anywhere by using the item? I want to smack some lazy people thay slack in raids.
---
&gt;My cousin and I
---
&gt;lovers
---
*laughs in Alabama*
---
This is actually amazing
---
Lmao why I see you everywhere gating in asmon you are a sad person my guy
---
I think it‚Äôs okay to love vanilla but desire a better UI (though the OP certainly could have expressed his complaints and desires in a more productive and diplomatic manner)
---
Dude are you that thick to not understand what I meant ?
---
Stoneskin effect got removed but stayed in effect what if devotion aura has a similar bug where it's removed from the other player but the armor bonus stays on that person despite having been removed. (stoneskin is also visible duuuuh)
---
He's talking about something that has already been fixed and calculations which CANT be wrong due to being ported over DIRECTLY from a reference client.
---
You're focusing on the wrong things to defend someone that doesn't need to be defended due to the fact that he is wrong and his point is invalid questionning things that have already been proven wrong and mis-attributing bugs
---
Not visible as in they‚Äôre ‚Äútracked‚Äù. 
---
it‚Äôs your teams last known location of the flag.
---
You'll be behind the pack like the rest of us and get into PUGs for MC and Ony.  There will be plenty of things to do before getting to more hardcore raids like BWL.
---
Also engineering goggles
---
Gnome clearly best pvp ally race for rogue and warrior. Hence why the top absolute try hard pvp player: Monkeynews perplexity etc are all Gnome. It‚Äôs escape artist and the +engineering skill and the tiny clock size and the smaller hit box. Ya op af in pvp
---
They do, although that will only lure them into the deadly labyrinth that surrounds both the early dungeons. ‚ù§Ô∏è Classic.
---
Their greatest sin was destroying BRD.
---
I've kitted Teremus to SW back in the day.  Can confirm Alliance boss does not attack him.  Also,  all the guards eventually do kill him as his health did not reset on live.
---
I really like the Venomshroud silk robe and the other varients with the big orb weaver spider on the front and back.
---
And that brings us back to my post. I wish i could filter it
---
i was joking, streamers are annoying
---
I would pick dwarf over gnome rogue anytime for pvp, but that's just me
---
Sometimes we can get tangled in the little things.
---
Does this mean we get handicap parking and disability checks now?
---
I think it would be cool if they rereleased the old expansions with a couple of important philosophies.
---
1. Maintain classic philosophy; ie, always encourage player interaction, game should be difficult.
---
2.Never increase past lvl 60, instead, reward new talents/ abilities, zone, dungeon, and raid access through zone questing.  (This allows old content to still be relevant, very important)
---
3.Revamp expansion zones to encourage world pvp.
---
I'm not in the beta
---
Even then, back in the day (up through Wrath, I'd say) low-level content mattered because you weren't zooming by it.  This started to be less true in Wrath, and by the time Cata hit, the leveling process was streamlined enough that you just plodded along until 85, 90, or whatever the level cap was for the expansion.
---
In Vanilla, the world was so dangerous that you wanted all the gear you could get.
---
In TBC, I remember stopping levelling at 19, 29, 39, etc. so I could farm really high-quality blues out of the PvP gear.  
---
In Legion, I would just queue for dungeons over and over because why bother leaving a city?
---
Killing cthun because it's probably the first fight where no one can be carried.
---
The people that complain about others "rushing to 60 by playing 16 hours a day" are just salty that they can't play as much.  They try to put down the people that have the time to spend instead of just accepting they can't play as much.  "They're going to miss so much content."  They do the same content as everyone else playing the game.  They just do more in a shorter period of time, because they play more.
---
In the first 2 minutes there's a clip in the background of preach killing asmon. Its gonna be great.
---
Play whatever you want. Human will pull ahead in an 'equal skill' situation, but ask yourself if you are going to raid hardcore. If not, you should be perfectly comfortable with going Gnome over Human, as should your guild.
---
Let's face it. Any food that takes longer to prepair then a gryphon ride should not be considered.
---
Tauren is the best race. 
---
Biggest armor in the game so you can clearly see the gear you get.
---
Yeah 100% lol. I am very excited about actually forming up and going to the actual entrance to do dungeons. I think that it will encourage people to work together because finding another group is not as easy as leaving group, waiting 10min and then queuing again.
---
:O
---
I think at that point it was just chaos.  When they tried to tame the chaos, they lost the flavor.
---
They tried hard to bring old content playable again with those timewalking dungeons for example. Too bad they were pretty pointless anyway.
---
** Dragon shows up on doorstep **

yup, you're both right.

Ahh sonyd the king of leeches

---
Now I'll admit it's been a while, but this is what I'd use when my agility was nearing 500, at which point Survival becomes better than MM for DPS.
---
The 3% hit from talents + 2% hit from DFT is pretty huge. Since T2  should have enough hit to keep you going it means you can go for more AP/Crit/Damage on cloaks/necks/etc.
---
You dont get to choose lol. You were either born before or after a certain date.
---
&gt; I think a small smattering of 5mans, maybe 4 or 5, a 10 man, and a 20 man would be the peak of how much room Vanilla has for more content. But I really don‚Äôt want to see Classic become bloated. Bloat is the biggest issue with the current game, and Vanillas pve content is well structured.
---
Personally naxx gear starts to go a bit over the top when you can e.g. oneshot poorly geared same level players. They should instead create different kind of procs which alter the playstyle of the class instead of raw stat upgrades. Blizz were imho pretty lazy in class development when they just started to remove procs and trinkets when some invented how to exploit them. Instead of curbing this random behavior, they should have just turbocharged more of that. Exploration was one of the things I used to do when I got bored at everything else. I moonwalked below stormwind and caverns of time before it was released. Good times.
---
Just make post filters and be done with it. People will always spam twitch videos/highlights, the best counter is just to let people filter them out entirely.
---
I'm just going to pick whatever servers have streamers on them.  I feel like they'll all congregate to one server and that'll be the most populated one.  I don't even watch streamers, I just want to be where all the action is.
---
Well usually then the DPS blames the tank, THEN the group disbands. But pretty spot on. lol
---
Das pretty good
---
To me this is wows number one downfall(and dungeon finder but that's for another time). This mentality, and the daily mentality, puts you on a train track rather than a hiking trail. You have to follow the speed of the expansion, log in every day to do your dailies, island expeditions every week, or risk falling behind and missing content. 
---
In the past, you just progressed through the tiers as was convenient for you (more complicated than that obviously). If you took a month off back in tbc, it didn't rly matter because you'd still be in t4 where you left off rather than a new tier has come out and now you're significantly undergeared. 
---
It also sucks because it encourages doing the same content over and over. It used to be you had multiple raids per tier, now you have one raid with multiple difficulties. This ruins immersion for me. I loved the idea of ok we got geared enough thru Kara, and have enough guildies now, to get into gruuls lair. I hate this new idea of we clear normal the first week, spend a few weeks on heroic, now we can progress through mythic. It just gets so old.
---
Most people will just decline. You don‚Äôt need anybody‚Äôs help in retail and people like to go their own pace which varies. It‚Äôs not like back in the day when help mattered and the world was full of people that were interested in the world. Now people just solo blast through levels in order to sit in Boralus all the time.
---
I was expecting something a little more sexy given the title. üòê
---
Yeah retard OP thinks the sub consists solely of people like him. I agree maybe the sub should get filters for people who don't want to see that content, but it's super blown out of proportion how much "streamer advertising" there is. I'd rather see clips of classic being played then shitty memes anyways...
---
Lmao. You‚Äôll find out in a few months
---
I am subbed, but really I only subbed to try and get an invite to beta lol. Honestly I don't really have any desire to play the current version of wow, although I do have a 120 character. I play other blizzard games and steam games to fill the void. I am still happy to join you guys if thats cool.
---
Likely not hardcore, but eventually I plan on raiding. Thanks a lot for the encouragement!
---
WotLK had the best and the worst of WoW, IMO.  At least through Mists of Pandaria.
---
Raids:  Best ever (Ulduar) and Worst ever (TOGC)
---
PVP: Best ever (Lake Wintergrasp) and Worst ever (Isle of Conquest)
---
TBC was my favorite expansion, but some of my best memories were in WotLK.
---
I don't play Taurens either, but playing with your friends is better than your character looking a certain way. 
---
You have to accept that you can't get everything you want in this situation and you have to compromise.
---
A: You don't play Druid so you don't have to be a Tauren
---
B: You suck it up and play Tauren so you can play Druid.
---
C: You abandon your friends to play in solitude, but you're a pretty elf girl.
---
The world where you play a NE Druid and your friends also play Alliance doesn't exist.
---
You ever wanna do multiple things in the game but don‚Äôt have the time to farm out the gold to do constant respecs? That‚Äôs why.
---
That's what I'm hoping for. Lemme claim disability yo.
---
Play a different class with your friends and play your night elf druid whenever you're not playing with them.
---
I never said anything about "perma loyal" as you put it.  I said I wouldn't have to worry about feeding him much anymore.  At level 6 loyalty you hardly ever have to feed your pet compared to lower loyalty levels.
---
Yup the issue OP has seems to be a moderation issue.. streamer clips are fine.. multiples of the same clip somehow getting through moderation is a problem.
---
&gt;Stoneskin effect got removed but stayed in effect what if devotion aura has a similar bug where it's removed from the other player but the armor bonus stays on that person despite having been removed. (stoneskin is also visible duuuuh)
---
Stoneskin is visible on your player screen? Where? 
---
&gt;He's talking about something that has already been fixed and calculations which CANT be wrong due to being ported over DIRECTLY from a reference client.
---
It cannot be wrong? The test client they are using is probably correct. I will agree. Porting a bunch of vanilla stuff into a BFA server could cause a host of problems. I shouldn't have to say that, it HAS caused a host of problems.
---
This is complete bullshit. I am an addict, and I can tell you that video games are not the problem. Some people have addictive disorder, so they‚Äôll get addicted to anything. It could be music, food, drugs, or anything really.
---
&gt; It's still wow, but most people between 12-18 have never stepped food into classic.
---
Which, this may be an incorrect assumption, but a lot of the viewers on streams are in this age group.
---
Fun? Must suck
---
Which is exactly where I rerolled in vanilla lol, I'm going to push through it this time. I'm still debating whether I should go Horde or Alliance though...
---
The graveyard run from the bottom right entrance on the map to Stonetalon Peak was absolutely ridiculous. I like the zone but it was a lot of running.
---
*cries in Barrens*
---
Hell, I'm signed up specifically because burning Crusade is my favorite so I'm expecting that to come.
---
I think capping at 50+ would be too much considering what sort of mischief level 30s have been able to get into. Gotta save some of the endgame wonder for actual launch.
---
I **would** like to see level 40 later in the beta though, that would let them really stretch their legs in regards to talent specs being used and would make for more interesting pvp situations, especially if they retest battlegrounds. I believe 40 is also the lowest possible level to get into BRD, which I would like to see run by an enormous group of level 40s.
---
Ultimate twinks playing against ultimate twinks. Most of the twinks were made to feel superior, noone enjoys being wreckt and one shoted. Bg queues will be affected by this as well.
---
The masses plays the new stuff, even if the old one were better.
---
Yes!! Wow. Nostalgia.
---
While i really dont know that i'd pay for that (i didnt buy a virtual ticket to play the demo), i think it really depends on how much money were talking here.
---
At 20 bucks its cheaper than a movie/soda/popcorn for yourself.  At 30-40 its cheaper than a decent meal and some beer/wine in a nice bar/restaurant, and youre going to get a SHITLOAD more hours out of it than either of those activities.  
---
For someone where money isnt falling from the sky, but also isnt tight...well, paying a bit to get in isnt going to hurt them any, and it honestly could save some in the long run if they dont do other things because theyre playing the beta.
---
It‚Äôs a shame though, I felt like defeating Arthas in WOTLK really closed a chapter in my childhood from playing Warcraft 3.
---
What a cute reply, who hurt you?
---
I can‚Äôt wait to sit and stare at my screen for 10 hours again and never get in!
---
Just questing in Tanaris for the first time. Will always have a special relationship to that done :)
---
I ran ZF Soo many times one my first char.
---
I don't like fun either.. also this will happen regardless of streamers so good luck in Classic :)
---
I'm letting my sub lapse on June 5th I think? and I'll Resub on August 27th.
---
Yes but Op said "Tanks have top priority" and then who would get it "Rogues or Fury Warriors" not Fury Warriors who sometimes OT. 
---
TF is THE weapon for tanking.
---
But a specifically "fury warrior" won't be tanking.
---
This question is asking a very specific scenario question that is unlikely to ever happen exactly in game given that most guilds will have 4+ tanks/OT and the likelihood of having 4+ TFs is pretty slim. But given the criteria of the question the rogue would be a better choice than a fury warrior.
---
I am just happy to see fresh people w/o any wow experience get involved in the beta for classic!  
---
It would be great if it ends up being a huge success with many new players and not just old school min-maxers or streamers.
---
Spriest was probably the least fun class I played during vanilla/BC. All you're brought to raid for is being a mana battery, spend the entire fight mind flaying and chugging mana pots because you go oom in 25 seconds.
---
Vanilla had a level 20/14days trial so Id expect classic yo have it too.
---
I see lot of people are complaining about pally, what about shockadin build ? I only played it on TBC and I loved it. I don't know if it's better or worse in Vanilla and I know that it isn't an optimal spec (you'll always prefer to heal with a pally) but it really changes the way you play the class. Any specialist here ?
---
Well Rogue is easily an S tier ranked class for classic WoW anybody who debates otherwise is flat out wrong.
---
 Rogue in PvP is very easy to play and experience strong results with when you factor in all of the *overly* powerful cooldowns they have but difficult to be a master at when requiring out of the box thinking when facing a counter class/spec such as the hunter. It is true the rogue is not as overpowered in group pvp battles as they would be in 1v1 or even 1v2. So if premades are your thing then good luck finding a good group. 
---
They also experience some pretty faceroll raiding yielding insane dps results with almost no effort with only downside being competition with other rogues and melee dps.
---
Leveling is a tad bit overrated as "BAD" or "2ND WORST NEXT TO WARRIOR!" where with my experience the only masochist leveling in the game is Warrior. Every other class compared to warrior obtains some sort of perk that makes their leveling or open world experience much better. Rogue with stealth/vanish/CD's/energy regeneration is something i'm sure the warrior dreams about. 
---
The only downside to rogue is your brother,mama, papa and grandmother oh and your grandmother's friends will be playing rogue.  But the same could be said for warrior and mage as well.
---
Isn't the classification mostly to secure more funding for research?
---
Not sure why. Most people could get in after 3 hours.
---
Literally a loaf of bread would be more qualified.
---
So I'm an ex IASIP addict. I use to watch every episode starting from season 1, to the last season available on Netflix. On repeat. Constantly. It got so bad that my attitude and dialogue started to change because of the increased influence from the show. (I turned into Charlie and said "jabronie" constantly) I finally broke the cycle and stopped watching the show, realizing I needed to purge my mind from it before it became uncleansable. It's been 2 years now and I can proudly say I havent watched a single episode of it, but dear god do I crave it. I crave it so much that I have to distract myself when the urge starts to build up. It's currently on my list of shows to watch on a loop during my classic playtime. I leveled in Wildstar and Rift with IASIP on repeat and I absolutely can not wait to do it again in Vanilla.
---
Well... When it's already out...
---
Excecute
---
Already have all the retail gold I need from carries. But if I can‚Äôt buy tokens I‚Äôll buy it another way.
---
There is no way to stop it.
---
Chopping off you silly is good to go tho
---
Yeah, no joke. Even as a caster, I got it at around level 12 or 13 or so on a mage, and my staff was hitting for easily 50-60% more than my best spell at the time.
---
I know we made some money clearing to the core and summoning people in to get the fragment for the quest.
---
Alchemy is so exxtremely OP at the first 20 levels.
---
I cant even describe how helpfull and time saving is a strong trol's blood potion for the HP regen
---
What OP said. And dont fuck whit murlocks!
---
My guild let me have one of our first Onyxia bags just to hold water for the raid.
---
Problem is, if you enable someone to change there specialisation at a whim, without penalty, the you loose attachment to that character.
---
if we're talking post history yours is easily comparable to a dog getting hit by a car
---
&gt;Look for a dude named "Tips" on Youtube. He has great videos on this and very straight forward. 
---
Some say he's the best warrior in duels. And others live in reality.
---
You are seeing the small percent here who are super dedicated. Yeah you will probably have trouble keeping up with them, however the vast majority will be more casual(even if they are more knowledgable). I am the only one in my guild(bunch of coworkers) who played classic and knows anything about it.   
---
Remember it will take a while to lvl so you have time to learn mechanics. You have about 2-3 months to learn information. Go find youtubers/streamers and old articles. I have been browsing here and other places to just keep learning as I plan on raiding because I didn't get to in vanilla.
---
Yea more research into why people think video games are addictive and then put restrictions on them. While we‚Äôre at it, let‚Äôs restrict music and art too! That‚Äôs addictive üòÇ
---
Oh wow. So much helpful advice, I cant say anything that hasnt been said already. I can feel the hype
---
There are plenty guilds already forming. If you are planning on going EU PvE Alliance you are welcome to join us
---
Yes there are issues, just not this one. This is just a repeat of an answered problem due to memories or private server data that people keep taking as real source.
---
It's wrong and people refuse to admit it.
---
Spirit scroll is the shit.
---
I did see that easter egg!!! 
---
I didn't mind War Crimes, it had its ups and downs... But yeah I was planning on steering clear or Stormrage... However, I wish they had audio versions of the War of the Ancients trilogy, I LOVED reading those.
---
Consistancy is a big factor I agree. But I don't know if I'm unique with this and it might be odd but I find that though I had no problem when I first played the game when I go back to low poly count games every thing seems really blurred and I struggle to pick out any detail or distinguish things. And it dosnt seem to be my eyes as I had them tested it happens even going from ass effect 3 back to mass effect 1 so I think it's a brain thing.
---
Yes.
---
Locks have some of the best utility spells out there!! I love the sacrifice bubble and ss, health stones are great aswell as life tap...they are meant for seem less leveling
---
I like being a druid with a couple spells and no shoes, struggling to find my way in an open and non(or less)-linear world without a built in quest helper. The more minimalist and atmospheric aesthetic gels well with the slower pace as well. 
---
One other thing that dovetails with all this, that I don't often see people mention, is that you rarely just solve all the problems in a zone. You help a little. Maybe take some water samples in Darkshore to help figure out the corruption, kill some bears, spy on some cultists...and then you leave...you might come back a couple levels later, do some more shit, and then leave again. Later questing in Ashenvale or Felwood might add context to your Darkshore experience, but not fully explain it. 
---
Later expansions show this may not have been an intentional guiding philosophy, but the diminution of both character and narrative both make you feel like a humble adventurer in a world much larger than you.
---
You are completely missing the point of his comment entirely. Like straight over your head. 
---
He's not saying dwarf isn't better. He is saying gnome is better than human and is viable. 
---
Also this isn't a comment about what you would choose it's a comment referencing the OP's racial choice and if it is a good fit for his rogue because he wants to be a gnome.
---
&gt; But in vanilla you get 50 talents in BfA you get 10.
---
Very few if any talents in classic impact your character.  There is about 6 talents per class and you usually only get two maximum that have a marginal effect on the play style of your character.  You also could have people selecting the wrong talents, which costs a pretty gold piece to reselect the appropriate talents, after you get rejected and laughed out of groups of elitists or min maxers.
---
If you know how to pool your rage prior to a new pull, you can have 80 Rage potentially. With 2-3 enemies hitting you, using Bloodrage and Revenge only being 5 Rage to cast, it's really easy to do what I just mentioned. The GCD + Auto Attack(Rage AND Threat) spent on an out-of Defensive Stance Thunder Clap + your Auto will end up being a waste.
---
How do you know then?

Then that‚Äôs gonna be a huge bummer for you. Everyone will expect it. It‚Äôs wild to me that people would be mad about using their class abilities. That‚Äôs part of what makes a lock so fucking sick. It was the same when I played a mage with the ports everywhere. People are gonna expect it but hey, I picked the teleport class. Shit charge people for it, but don‚Äôt get butthurt when party members ask for it. Especially when summons will make shit easier for everyone.
---
you can "request to join group" in classic beta currently.
---
In vanilla a warrior can tank 5mans as a dps spec pretty much all the way to 60. Just need to equip a sword n board.
---
Too true
---
His quote of "gnome is actually a better choice" was saying "gnome is a better choice than human for pvp" because he was comparing the two races in his first sentence.
---
When mages finally get to go full Fire and seriously fuck shit up. Yep.
---
1) create a toon on another server with the same name
---
2) transfer there, forced name change
---
3) transfer back
---
boom - name changed
---
Less time parking = More time playing.
---
The idea isn't to level though, it's just to be there to fuck the servers up.
---
It's hard in different ways. It's not mechanically hard like it is on current live, although I do think people underestimate vanilla difficulty a bit. Sure there are fewer mechanics, but there were also fewer skills to deal with those mechanics.
---
The difficulty of vanilla raiding is the meta difficulty of managing a guild that was large enough to regularly field 40 players who can get along for a few hours but not so large as that people felt left out. It was working together to farm mats, consumes, attainments, pre-raid bis, rep, all that stuff. In a way in vanilla the raid isn't the game, the raid is the payoff for all of that collaborative work you did as a guild. Vanilla's difficulties are social.
---
What would you rather see than gameplay clips? More shitty discussion threads that have been hashed over a million times? Maybe some more half assed memes? Idk I'd rather see gameplay from the current beta
---
But now you sound contrarian.....there is no game before 2004 you would play again? Thats a fuckload of classic you have jsut dismissed right there
---
I never used nameplates in Vanilla, never liked them, and I recently noticed they show up even when there is no line of sight, for example if you're on the roof in wsg you can see people coming to you. Was it like this in Vanilla too? I found it odd to be honest.
---
Play tauren female, trust me, i leveled 3 60 druids 1 male and 2 female and i wasnt a big fan of tauren either. Having the female model and animations made it so much more enjoyable.
---
It's not about them speaking their language at all(though I do find that disrespectful to a certain extent) more like I'm worried about ending up on a server where I can't find an English speaking guild. ^^ of course if I play Vanilla I want a strong server community but that's not possible if majority speak another language and you can't communicate with them.
---
I'm only going to take one day off from work I think.  It kinda sucks that it's on a Tuesday of the week I don't have Friday off from work (we get off on alternating Fridays).  Monday will be spent making sure my apartment is clean and sleeping at 7pm so I can wake up at 3am to play all night/day.  I can probably get to about level 18-20 or so in a day, which would put me ahead of the pack by a bit.  Then I'll fall back in with the majority for the work days that I can only play 4 or so hours.  I can probably get to about level 30 by that first weekend which would get me into STV quickly and not get ganked so much.  Then I can take my time and run SM a few times for gear and quests while I move to the zones I don't remember as well.
---
I work in an office. It's accurate.
---
it is a massive issue for t1 guilds but for a different reason; your tank might just quit because he's BiS.
---
Am i the only one who ends up never using potions or consumables from quests while levelling because "I might need them later " üòÇ
---
Because, and I am sure you know this, there is a fundamentally different mindset to how content was designed then versus now. Now is designed for player retention and maximum profits/subscribers. Then was "lets make a fun cool RPG! If we do that, people will stay subscribed!"
---
I just started seeing someone and I'm worried it's gonna fall apart in 3 months
---
As a very casual player it's nice having a huge, interesting and non-linear world to quest through. In retail it's like you're either Mythic raiding or just not actually even playing a game.
---
Proves nothing - the precise naming of many cvars has been modified heavily over the years. Hell, look at how massively changed the addon and macro format over the years.
---
RIGHT. https://www.disability-benefits-help.org/disabling-conditions/mental-disorders
---
Looking it up right now.
---
Do you remember how to find this post?  I looked and didn't find this.
---
I'd pay a lot of money to be in your position, and try the game new without any knowledge.
---
Yup troll's blood potions are amazing.  Especially for damage dealers.  Been doing some testing internally since I didn't get into beta, and as a warlock with troll's blood pots up (they last an hour), the extra healing per 5 combined with demon armor makes you unstoppable.

Since we are a Semi-hardcore guild, we don‚Äôt expect everyone to minimax every aspect of their game but we do expect a proactive approach from our members and willingness to learn and keep excelling in their role. 
---
For those that want to participate in PVE content, we are looking for committed players that are able to raid 3 days a week.

I know Warrior is the best and they are the true tank. I just don‚Äôt have the time anymore to raid so I‚Äôm gonna roll prot pally for fun. Tank 5 mans and call it good.
---
Hahahaha
---
I haven't subbed since wod and got a classic invite, also every account on my bnet is banned
---
The only thing it scales with is percentage modifiers ‚Äú increases damage by x% for y seconds‚Äù if I‚Äôm not mistaken so Death Wish is something to make sure to pop but if your guild or group is good you may want to pop it a bit earlier, as you don‚Äôt want the boss dead and you still have 7 seconds of death wish left
---
Thanks for confirming that even if there is such a possibility it shouldn't be too much of a problem. I really hope to make some friends when I play Classic so I hope I get into a server with a lot of other people I can communicate with :D
---
An outlier story Vs. A standard in classic. 
---
Not sure what the point of the post is. This is a fringe case used to prove what? That social stuff can happen in retail? 
---
Well duh, of course it can. But if you claim it's anything like the classic community or experience you're delusional X)
---
found the boomer :)
---
I'll wait for Bellular react to all of that.
---
They were kinda lame in PvE in vanilla imo, and they had too many debuffs that weren't really worth it. For pvp though, golly gee whiz, they were a hell of a lot of fun. There's a certain level of joy after a warrior charges you out of beserker stance, you fear him, dot him up, skip along for a little bit, re-dot him when he comes back near, and mind flay him down, taking almost no damage.
---
Hunters and rogues too stronk though.
---
Im not a 100% sure about this. I dont think one or two pieces of leather will eff you up too much in the armor department. I can imagine it boils down to maybe like 2-5% extra physical damage taken (numbers pulled right out of my ass, so id check to be sure) which is something, but not gamebreaking. Depending on the stats some leather pieces might be better than plate pieces for PvP. Atleast untill you get your PvP gear or plate gear from raids. (My warrior friend ran with the devilsaur set in PvP due to the lack of anything else good in those slots and in my opinion it worked fine.  
---
As for hit, you dont need as much as in PvE. 5% for yellows to have a 100% chance to hit a player. Unless the player you are hitting has some sort of talent that reduces your chance to hit him (i know rogues has one that when fully specced into reduces your chance to be hit by 4%, which in turn means you would need 9% hit to never miss a yellow.)  
---
But hit can be good past 5% aswell, because whites have a incredibly high chance to miss, couple that with white attacks being most of your rage generation and it becomes kind of important for most of your whites to connect aswell. But there are a lot of people that know a million more things about warriors than me, and browsing some forums might net you some more valuable intel than what i am able to provide.
---
I got a beta invite two weeks ago, I‚Äôm not a big streamer or have any blizzard influence. I canceled my WoW sub a month prior but still has a few days on it. I do have a day one account though, been playing since launch day of vanilla. I also opted in for the beta a few days after it became an option. It‚Äôs definitely not streamer/friends only. Do you want with this information to increase your chance of getting in. My theory is that I got in because of my accounts age. Most likely they sent invites to people who played on launch.
---
I think the idea of capping the game at 60 but adding seasons is great. 
---
Imagine that you can do later expacs content but within a limited time frame, these will drop unique gear and transmogs for your character. Some time later the season changes and they incorporate some of the gear into the vanilla raids and dungeons so they don't become irrelevant, this way the new content is exciting and the old content is still relevant. Older players have a reason to play, newer players don't get alienated.
---
Another feature that in my opinion makes a mmo shine is events, even in a classic server i see no reason why blizz can't for example throw in some world bosses or make some community events, these will bring people together and offer a nice change of pace.
---
The vanilla setting was really perfect for the kind of game it was. It was more of a faction cold-war. There were border skirmishes like in Ashenvale, but for the most part it was just an uneasy truce leading to a world that was mostly stable, but in which it made sense to go out and murder the opposing faction.
---
a warrior that keeps on top of their gear can 2h tank almost any dungeon content.
---
Pre-bis armors are my favorite, I loved putting together good looking outfits that were in the top 1-3 spots for prebis. The pieces from 5 and 10 mans looked more like armor you would actually wear. I found it much better looking than any tier sets. Of course excluding robes of the exalted (gross).
---
If I had to pick a set, I think bloodvine is possibly my favorite one.. It helped mages get away from how ugly wow made robes.
---
What is that on CEST?
---
you the best fam
---
Troll‚Äôs Blood potion + Demon Armor on a low level Warlock with lifetap means basically infinite mana and hp. Such a feelsgood combo early on.
---
Ye I expected them to wipe hard in DM (Deadmines not Dire Maul) but they absolutely steamrolled it. Saw the same in Blackfathom deeps.
---
The big time issue imo is they‚Äôve made the game increasingly accessible which then makes the game feel like you don‚Äôt really have a choice in what you do. So many things have been removed and classic really is a stark difference. With classic it truly is forging your own experience. Its up to you to decide what talents are best, which enchants to use etc. what separates players in this case is knowledge, which honestly is how it should be.
---
agree with this, it's hard enough to find someone even with the pool as big as it is, don't just look for other gamers lol there are plenty of partners out there who are fine with doing their own thing and respecting your hobbies as well. Sure it's a bonus if they have similar interests but there are more things in life to do together if they don't like video games. No big deal really.. just make sure you don't forget about them haha
---
No, that's superstition.  It's possible that it technically is a factor in the determination, but it's just as likely that someone that is subscribed gets passed over.
---
Just make sure you're opted in on the Beta page of your battle.net Profile.
---
Why? There are legit concerns around that tech that might spoil the Classic experience if they do it wrong.
---
They should make a reason to redo many old raids like they did with Naxx. It was really fun and a great way for people to experience old content that isn't trivially easy without having to play a private server or, now, classic.
---
I'm super excited to get classic but I would be equally excited for a chance to do Kara, BT, and TK again which obviously isn't something that will be possible in classic.
---
People will expect it, but if they are hanging around in the IF AH while the group is moving to the entrance. They shouldn't count on a summon.
---
And when I say taxi, if they are moving towards the dungeon/raid. Then I will gladly help with a summon, but if they are not, they better start running.
---
Preach in particular is very confusing. He's frequently ripped on vanilla not as a bad game, but a game that he felt was just an earlier, worse version of modern WoW. Hard time knowing if he's legit or just following the hype train for views.
---
Rise of the horde. great book!
---
best wow content creator, full stop.
---
They're such a necessity though, because when you finally get that first full length cloak...you're a god.
---
The objective point of beta is not advertising, or letting people stream content creation.  It is to get players to help fine tune the classic experience and report bugs.  It is why every item and NPC has the tooltip to report a bug on them.  They are thankful for the free eyeball views their game gets, but they purposely are inviting players that have helped in past beta tests by submitting meaningful feedback on their unfinished game.
---
amazing comment
---
Not a fan of the kind of culture that those types of groups attract. I gotta say Ill be doing the opposite and trying to avoid any servers with large groups of streamer fans. I've seen what they bring to other games I've played and it's almost always negative.
---
It‚Äôs a big deal because it‚Äôs a limited access. Themselves the deadmines are not a huge accomplishment. I don‚Äôt mind seeing streamers talk about it, but claiming it ¬´¬†world first¬†¬ª is absolutely ridiculous and is only clickbaiting and false.
---
&gt; Yeah unfortunately random internet guy needs to tell people how it is sometimes
---
Lmao. Oh sorry pro player. You are just making assumption about others, and you apparently have no idea what you talk about. That's probably why people upvoted my comment instead of yours.
---
You‚Äôre right, I hadn‚Äôt thought about it from a beta test side of things.
---
Just saw it as a lot of bitching and negativity on reddit as opposed to the OP trying to find out if this really was a bug he should report.
---
I'd sub to reserver names, can't imagine I'm alone. Not willing to sub for a tiny hypothetical increased chance at a beta invite, but if Blizz wants to offer some deterministic carrot to encourage early subs, I'm sure there'd be a decent number of takers.
---
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105541-mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule/
---
You can even go to 8 tank if you talk about the 4 horsemen ;)
---
So your assumption that someone is subscribed to r/classicwow and not going to play the game, for whatever reason, but watching some streamer‚Äôs mom hit 60 is going to change their mind?
---
From what I can remember of classic is that raiding is slower than you might think. When a guild is just starting out you are not going to be chain pulling in MC. Each pull will be slow to minimize the risk of a wipe, and having adds. 
---
Wipes will happen, and they are huge time sinks. Running back to the instance rebuffing everyone. Having everyone ready to go again because some will take bathroom breaks during this time. 2-3 wipes in one night will quickly go through that 3.5hr time slot.
---
I can't wait to stress heal everyone in dungeons so they don't need to walk back from the graveyard, I hope some ppl will add me to their friendslist againg like back in time that would be amazing for me
---
Cool!  I was in the first one
---
Nope. If it was, so little of the player base knew about it that it should be considered an exploit.
---
The whole "world first" thing is a joke..
---
Fuck dailies/weekly quests. Any game with them I just end up quitting because I hate feeling like I'm obligated to log in instead of playing the game when I want to play it.
---
When I first started gaming I was constantly belittled for doing so. Spend more time outside. Go out and get drunk. Go be a silly teenager etc etc. But I enjoyed what I was doing and I dare say it helped me grow into a well rounded individual. Meanwhile, the people that did go out drinking etc, are now total wastes of space. Lots of them have kids they didn't want (and clearly resent them), have done drugs, are drains on society etc. Yet because we enjoy gaming, we are the issue?
---
leave your friends behind horde sucks
---
I love the ebb and flow of autism in this sub.
---
Yeah I think they said since you could still accomplish getting to closest stop by disconnecting in Vanilla (a workaround), they‚Äôd just add the button and remove the hassle of having to disconnect to achieve it.
---
Well obviously you don‚Äôt waste your rage if you have excess. But I just remember on early levels struggling to handle 3+ mobs threat unless you danced a bit to utilize other abilities. The moment the first mobs swing is a miss then dodge, you‚Äôre sorta either stuck between a few options to hold threat at sub 30. And a lot of those involve more aoe then just tabbing through with sunder. You only have so much time to build threat before that healer has to heal you and starts ripping agro
---
Your absolutely wrong dead zone kiting was a thing it isn't a thing and inst possible in beta. https://youtu.be/k01xsCj_m20 look through here and warrior fights and tell me how many "leeway" auto attacks hit the rogue in deadzone.
---
Leeway works when two targets are running. Leeway is supposed to shut off with a significant slow because one person is perceived as walking.
---
yeah but a few thousand people paying 180$ a year only pays for a few engineers and a server. doesn't seem very profitable for the blizz machine.
---
Exactly. 'Balance' is murky, hard to define state that no one will ever agree is reached. You say you're satisfied with TBC balance but not enough people were at the time, so they stripped out more unique abilities to make arena 2v2s viable for every class. Its NEVER enough as long as one kid can point to a good player doing something cool and whine "I WANT THAT"
---
You could try understanding the word you're trying to replace.
---
Obviously you dont shift out only to auto.
---
Turn the question around and instead ask if there's any reason to NOT auto the opponent when you shift out to cast rejuv on yourself anyway.
---
that was my least favorite of the books. highly recommend any of the books that relate to NE or horde.
---
On the one hand, I'm thrilled you found that thread
---
On the other hand, the only reasonable explanation for OP is that shadow priests just melt faces
---
I played vanilla. 
---
I remember the first the we I ever did wailing caverns. There was no map for the dungeon, you simply had to explore your way through it. And it wasn't simple. 
---
Tanks had to pull carefully, mages actually had to cc, you needed to give the tank a second or two to build threat before you could dps, and mana breaks were happening very often. 
---
My first run through the dungeon took about 2 hours, including people falling on that one section where you have to make 2 jumps across some platforms else fall about a minute behind, more if you got lost (which was very easy)
---
I'm genuinely getting excited to play vanilla again.
---
Seals
---
Thanks üòÑ
---
Seems unlikely that we would go 15 years without figuring out how to do it on 1.12 client. Many private server add-ons have tried to do exactly this, to no avail.
---
the game has no feeling of progression whatsoever even at low level. every zone feels the same, every task is the same. game sucks lmao
---
I was an asshole as a kid. If people hate him from 10-15 years ago, I think it's a bit unwarranted as people mature.
---
Dwarves were never asked about, so it‚Äôs completely irrelevant.  Not sure why you‚Äôre so stuck on Dwarves.
---
OP very specifically asked about Gnomes, and referenced not wanting to play human.  He didn‚Äôt ask if dwarves were viable or what the best PvP race is.
---
This is the wrong sub for that
---
Try /r/wowservers
---
Do they know about classic?
---
Sadly im on a pserver. But if I can survive the suffering of 100s of allianve ganks. I can survive the layered classicwow
---
Well she's grinding green level 52 mobs at level 59 and taking a second to click every ability. She's the definition of a casual MMO player. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
---
when I quit wow in TBC I still maintained a level 29 twink. It was so much fun. And just for people who never experiend it, it was not to shit on normal players. The battleground were nearly exlusivly filled with twinks. What was so good about it that you had to gear your character only once and then could treat it like a round of counterstrike or any moba since you didnt need to play the game more to keep up with gear. I really liked that you could still play the game copetatively without needing to put any time in it.
---
If only Trolls could be Locks in vanilla lol, Regen City
---
Oh alright. Thanks sir
---
Ion stated there will be NO layering past phase 1 at the latest (so it might be removed earlier). 
---
&gt; log off for 2 days
---
What does this have to do with anything? Once layers are removed, it doesnt matter what layer(s) you were ever on; effectively everyone is logged into layer 1, all the time, always.
---

You know im right, admit it, why bother craving for moral highground?

Ahh I just try not to assume things and just read the ol tooltips
---
Thanks! Just what I was looking for
---
Ok guys chill
---
I think I'll be playing alliance for this very reason. I'm pretty familiar with the horde leveling through vanilla, but not alliance. (at least not after level 25 or so)
---
In before ‚ÄúPRIVET SERVERS ARENT ACCURATE REEEEEEEE‚Äù
---
I'm a total noob with Drive, how do I share this with my friens so my friens can fill it in?
---
You gonna start it up?
---
Not true. If a game is so hard that doing it alone means wasting time and dying a lot, people *will* interact more. It id absolutely a system that does it for you. That's why Starwars Galaxies was known to have one of the best communities in a game; people needed each other for everything.
---
It isn't about what you put in; people will take the path of least resistance 99% of the time. If that means playing with others, the game will have a good community. It all comes down to the developers.
---
The same is the case IRL as well. Now that people don't need each other anymore, communities are fewer and weaker than ever, and will continue to erode. 
---
"You get out what you put in" is a nice phrase, but it has no real connection to reality.
---
The healing hunter is passable.   
---
But a paladin tank, that's just blatantly unbelievable.
---
Ulduar was one of the best raids, I could redo the first few bosses forever. 
---
I didn‚Äôt mind TOGC. Was rather straightforward, but that first time the floor broke was pretty awesome. I do have fond memories of grinding reputation for all of the cities. And eventually soloing Chillmaw, fond memories indeed.
---
I'll probably get a lot of negativity for this, but most of them are shit.
---
If you are avid reader of fantasy or science fiction they pale in comparison to other books in the genres. Some are absolutely awful. 
---
IMO, avoid anything by Christie Golden, don't believe her hype. Especially her later works.
---
There's a couple good ones in there but generally not worth. You're better off reading The Chronicle or watching Nobbel videos if you want to brush up on lore.
---
This is so stupid I love it.
---
[Wowhead with Thottbot Theme checked at the top](https://classic.wowhead.com/) is as close as we'll get.
---
Huh.. that's totally reasonable..
---
theres some truth to it but its crazy how im getting downvoted on r/wow for just saying that classic is good and thats not up for debate. people are saying utterly mindless things like "lvling isn't fun" and "modern wow has more action"
---
When I started playing in 2005 there wasn't a quest addon yet, and I was looking up every quest on thottbot...the long version of quest helper.  So doesn't matter to me honestly.
---
RED DEFIAS MASK WAS WORTH THE NIGHT ELF DEATH RUN 100%

You don't even get to be a mana battery in vanilla. Although I'll disagree with boring, PvE shadow priests are one of the most fun casters. Because of your mana efficiency you actually have to balance you're dps vs casting enough to keep the Shadow Vuln buff up, include consumables for mana in your rotation as well, have 3 dps abilities that you need to use. The downside of course being that even played and geared optimally, you still far underperform a frost mage pushing one button.
---
Ikr. Not like I am gonna run SimCrafts and stuff lol.
---
Also around that level is the Aurora Cowl, the only white hood in the game. In case you need one for... cosplay
---
find a SO who plays WoW so you can have both. or at least one who respects, supports and accepts your interests.
---
Allow people to use tags for their posts that relate to specific types of content (r/wow and r/globaloffensive do this), people do this to tag posts related to actual discussion, bugs, twitch clips, etc. 
---
This way people can hide specific tags that they aren't interested in (twitch clips, etc), whilst others who still enjoy them can keep watching.
---
How do you know if you got into the beta?
---
What's the point of this post lol
---
osrs is not like classic wow.  It would be like if classic wow implemented the dungeons and raids from TBC through MOP.
---
Im sorry but the title of this thread is delibierately looking to start a fight or at least shit on BFA, I count that as toxic to some degree
---
Well you know what they say about assuming. It makes an ass out of u and me. 
---
But hey, at least I didnt take till 60 to learn that lesson
---
Maybe like 10 or 15 people?
---
sigh... yeah.
---
Because blizzard didn't had an issue for a decade with people only logging in on reset day... it's like the last 14 years of feedback and developpement never happened.
---
That would be awesome!!
---
I &lt;3 it  
---
I just edited it for my purpose. I removed the armor type but added playstyle to see who plan to play it  hardcore, semi-hardcore, regular or just casual.
---
once the expansion is over, balance all the stuff down from lvl70 to lvl60 so Icecrown Cita will be same difficulty as Black Temple and AQ40 for lvl60s, but for new content you would be forced to slow leveling up 10levels to reach the endgame content for expansion. And of course remove the flying for non-toplvl characters. Realms would have integrity once again and you wont be able to do everything in DND mode clicking for bis loot ;) 
---
But thats just an concept, luckily they will never do it so we have the classic on official servers &lt;3
---
&gt;If you start to add more things after Naxx, they need to have items worth obtaining without having too many items worth obtaining otherwise you run the risk of over saturating the end game content or invalidating the need to run other raids. Not only that, but you need to be smart about which item slots for which classes are valuable upgrades.
---
They could add some kind of "max itemlevel" on each player and reduce the effectiveness of increased stats after that level. Another thing they could do, is to limit the number of raid ip's of max level / gear characters so that you can't participate in everything. Some top end guilds were really harsh for their members when they required almost 100% participation on raids and multiple hours of raid/stuff every day.
---
god you come across as a dick bro lmao
---
At least you can sense the Kodos in Barrens.
---
First time running through Scarlet Monastery and the constant wipes because of pats. Loved it.
---
i made the mistake of going to westfall once. never again!
---
I‚Äôve found it to be pretty easy to level cooking off all the ingredients you get from your typical questing path
---
1) no, hes saying the way layering works isnt a hard limit, ie if layer 1 has 3K people layer 2 kicks in. Rather, as layer approaches 3K, a new layer gets spun up and some new logins get sent here.  
---
&gt; never log out

Yea totally man, I can force the server side socket to stay open indefinitely. Its not like Blizzard has root access, can disconnect you, can set up automated jobs to boot you for long login times as that's clearly abuse. Nah man none of that's possible, my connection is the connection that will pierce the system reboot!
---
Hell, I ran into this on my warlock. Spec burning rush or trail behind the party arriving in time to cast a single instant cast before the charge to the next target.  
---
Most groups didn't even pause to loot because it'll all just show up in the mail, so trying to loot a pack of mobs left me playing catch up all dungeon.
---
I love walking by random people and buffing them with Fortitude, seeing their health double.
---
Horde: I hate the walking for quests in this zone, hate the music as ive been hearing it for the last 20ish lvls aready, hate that a good portion of the quests requeir you to go to all the adjacent zones
---
MoP was a fine expansion, I really enjoyed it,  but hey I played it with like 10 friends. Biggest problem it had that really few player liked it so it was way too hard to get new faces for raiding. 
---
Vanilla had huge population, close kit community, so you basicly knew most players on the server. The game wasn't that great, but it gave pretty big freedome and didn't force anything on you.
---
How are you doing it? I had the same idea, but Blizz took out all the easy money missions from the garrison and class order halls. The idea of actually playing retail to farm gold via the AH sounds terrible.
---
I think it's the best bet. And priests are fun to level. You level as shadow from lvl 40 and are super powerful in PvP.
---
100% agree. we got one as a gift and we LOVE it. i put together a huge list of recipes that are instant pot friendly so we can enjoy good meals but have more time to play
---
Fun fact: The Draenei were actually fully introduced in Burning Crusade via a massive retcon of the Broken as seen in Frozen Throne. In classic, the Draenei as we know them today simply do not exist.
---
Wow
---
yeah the problem is on stress test the layers rearrange so often they might as well be shards. you will get killed by repops if you're questing or clearing hard to reach mining nodes and herbs. Or - the herb and mine disappears completely and you still get killed by repops.   
---
I wish someone would link where blizz is discussing whether its current behavior is bugged or not. I really hate the current sharding/layering whatever the hell - its immersion breaking
---
I‚Äôve never been so invested in a character as I was when I first read that books, or when I read it again, or the time after that...
---
Because SP has a different feel than a mage, it's very simple. Also I didn't say anything about what I'm going to play before, maybe you've mistaken me for another user.
---
If you want to know, I'm going disc/holy at the beginning then I'll switch into shadow once I've some gear because my focus will be on PvP with my priest char.
---
How so
---
Google can
---
INTJ-A (Architect), with the N being close to 50/50.
---
Good idea. I'll try and see if that HDD is still alive.
---
I never ventured into naxx during vanilla so I didn't mind having it in wotlk, but that's probably just me.
---
Looking forward to getting full might set again with a draconian deflector and of course the piece de resistance a Quel'Serrar
---
Im on mobile, have you made it so that if you choose a class which can only heal/dps you can only choose those two options?
---
I haven't played WoW in about 10 years at this point, and it's funny to hear that this is a thing (no offense to you).
---
I still remember going in with a friend group and taking our time setting up who takes what mob, everyone in voice comms, and if someone fucks up it could be a wipe if the run was a hard one.
---
More dots!
---
you can cook the chicken and veg at the same time then cook the rice in the broth you cooked the chicken and veg in. it makes for a pretty simple and tasty meal.
---
&gt; Then during some bigger releases 100k+ concurrent players and after mobile was released it tended to stay above 100k at almost all times. Right now there's 67k online. 
---
So, to me, this means that in order for classic or modern wow to experience a giant growth of population, they should try to do some prototypes on bringing wow to consoles and perhaps tablets.
---
No. I'm just having a conversation for nostalgia sake
---
I knew what this was before I even clicked on it. Good times.
---
Dude... seriously?
---
Sweet
---
Please its so annoying
---
Ill support you from afar.
---
You should be fine! FTH
---
&gt; So seductive, in fact, that no other (theme park) MMOs have tried to solve the expansion problem differently.
---
Dark Age of Camelot. Expansion 1 (Shrouded Isles) and 2 (Trials of Atlantis) added new gear, not new levels.
---
Reroll
---
I will be tanking :)
---
Him doing SM solo will always be a fond memory
---
That's how I felt when I started in legion. I wanted to do raids and really try out content as I went through it as if it were the live patch. Stuff just goes too fast and there aren't enough players there to experience it that way anymore.
---
That is so wrong.... Tanking is about control of situation, which always include having the highest threat. But it also often includes other things such as leading, organizing and instructing the group. Tanks who forget about these and think it's only about max threat are usually shitty tanks ;-)
---
I love Westfall, it's the start of the grind.  I love all those zones in that area except Redridge.  But Westfall, Duskwood (especially) and STV is great zones.
---
Yes, a great part of WoW until they deleted it. It makes all the content in the game relevant because you could do it at lvl 19, 29, 39... Maybe my favorite character I ever made in WoW was a nigh-unkillable level 49 feral Druid with the Warden Staff. The only change in Classic WoW I would ask for is the ability to lock XP to facilitate twinking.
---
The one on the 29th will be two hours earlier, with a level cap of 10. Keep in mind that it runs for 24 hours--the first one actually had events going on shortly before the closing time, not just during the initially focused launch window.
---
&gt; "You get out what you put in" is a nice phrase, but it has no real connection to reality.
---
Literally what
---
&gt; Blizzard adds Karazan as Tier 4 raid in Classic,
---
the content added after classic was balanced based on the 2.0 version of factions, classes, races, talents and skills.  The biggest change would be a toss up between the unique classes now being cross faction and specs that became relevant in end game pve.
---
Hunters get a bad rep as they rolled on absolutely everything but I had fun playing my hunter and BM was decent for me in pvp
---
Is there an especially high tax on games/online subscriptions?
---
Great video and you make some great points. I hope blizzard sees this.
---
If this isnt a troll post. Blizzard is dusting off their old "vanilla" wow servers and are going to pretty much re release it at the certain patch from the old days. MOST things will stay just as they were back then so people can relive or experience for the first time how the original game was like.
---
None of the above, must not have explained well. Important note: I‚Äôm an engineer, not a game designer, I can really only speak to load balancing theory. 
---
Essentially it seems like the disconnect is *why* layers actually help server load - It‚Äôs a rate of change thing. So like, if I know the server pop up front, I don‚Äôt need layers, can do one flat server. If I don‚Äôt know the server pop, I can use layers to dynamically allocate resources without server restarts. 
---
So if the rate of change is high and positive (tons of new logins) you can spread logins across layers proportional to the rate of change and do the inverse relationship for log offs
---
In reality server pops only take a month or so to stabilize after launch so probably won‚Äôt see layers ever again afterwards
---
**It's all acting, streamers screaming, shouting and yelling, its all part of the act to get more donations and subs, this concept has worked for many years, PewDiePie, Ninja are good examples...**
---
Theres a reason people in Venezuela farm gold for a job right now.

I once forgot to put summoning on my bar, it was about 30 too when I started to question not having it

By no means an exhaustive list. I'm a huge C&amp;C fan and I still play some of those from time to time. https://cncnet.org/ My favorite is RA2
---
And then lets not forget all the crowd favorites from N64 and SNES. People literally still buy N64s to play the old school Mario Kart on. Nintendo released a mini console recently so people could play those old games on. The emulation scene for those consoles has been going strong for years.
---
I only remember it ever being the lightning orb appearance personally, but I definitely have no sauce with which to serve you this information.
---
because tanking is atrocious pre wotlk
---
TOGC itself wasn't bad.  The fact that it made Ulduar obsolete so you're doing the same 5 bosses 4x a week is what was bad.
---
Ever heard of "hybrid specs" i cleared aq40 on my "resto" druid but i was 30 feral / 21 resto. No one ever knew. My friend was shaman 30 ele 21 resto. You can basically do the same with all classes lol. People cannot inspect your talents. Most paladins are 30 holy 21 Ret for pvp fun.
---
&gt; think back on the various tasks and distractions that interrupted you from enjoying WoW in the past
---
Whats the easiest way to break up with my girlfriend? All advice will be considered
---
No I just don‚Äôt like blind sheep worshiping streamers like they‚Äôre gods. They will ruin whatever server they‚Äôre on
---
Vanilla wow isn't a sandbox game
---
Whether it was in Vanilla or not I do think it should be taken out, and I have used it personally to avoid skull mobs and pvp groups I didn't want to fight on beta.
---
No point in subbing for a chance unless you're a streamer.  Everyone knows that.
---
I'm new to wow (2/3 months) and I started to play because of Classic. I always wanted to experience what I couldn't do years before because I had no money, you know. I found super exciting the 1-100 levelling and I loved the world. Then I started to feel more bored about levelling. I joined a guild at 120 and started to do m+ and raids. I like this PVE experience but it's not a RPG. 
---
I came from League of Legends and I feel like retail wow content is like a huge LoL with PVE and PVP, but not a rol game. You go for a queue or a group finder and you use to be summon to the place. Now i'm levelling alters only and login in my main for raiding. I hope new content fix BFA, so we can play vanilla and retail and have fun with both.
---
Btw water is wet.
---
Least played classes will be Druid, Shaman and Pally. Other than that it's quite even, with a lot of people going Warrior, Mage and Rogue.
---
i would say it makes sense as fishing poles are its own type of weapon and it needs to take its weapon skill from somewhere so fishing skill seems likly.
---
Just have the latest expansion's stats also apply to previous exp stats
---
in classic, tank = warrior and warrior is the fucking worst to level. i'm set on playing warrior for classic because it's the most fun class at 60... been playing in beta and i watch hunters/warlocks/mages 2-3 levels lower than me have no problem doing quests that i'm struggling with. you don't get to level professions as a warrior unless you want to grind on top of all the mob grinding, everything you get goes into first aid/cooking and keeping 2 stacks of food in your bags so that you can bandage/eat after every 1-2 mobs you fight.
---
Getting one half of the windseekers bindings from MC and not competing the set and getting my thunderfury until last year....
---
Too ugly to ever be loved :(
---
Awesome work!
---
I love tanking but I am mostly a dungeon player. I will do some raiding if possible, but it will be "casual", I will not aim for Naxramas...
---
The problem for me is that I dont like warrior tanking in dungeons. I like paladin tank a lot. But the thing with paladin is that I need to be healer to go into raids which I do not like.
---
If only warrior in vanilla had Thunder clap on usable on defensive stance and generate aggro... (like in TBC). 
---
On the other hand I also like tanking as druid in dungeons, but again, if I wanna go raid I will need to change to heal. Thats why TBC is my best wow version (although I love vanilla too).
---
Yeah, I don't know why they changed it.  That seemed like a part of the strategy, IMO.
---
Fair enough, haven't played beta or retail (in many years) to have known.
---
Hunters have a very high skill cap just to be on par with other dps. There pet system in vanilla is pretty wonky and pet manager is a nightmare and easy to pull random dungeon and raid patrols. Ontop of there diamant√© not scaling well with gear past BWL.
---
&gt;Ehhh I find tailoring for mages and locks to speed up lvling
---
It speeds up your kill speed and reduce your downtime once you get the gear. It does not speed up your leveling. Not even close. The amount of cloth you get from leveling can cover first aid, which is arguably a much stronger profession to keep up to your level than tailoring, meaning you cannot level both.
---
Keep in mind that those aren't retcons, but simple story progressions (of questionable quality for many).
---
The Highborne from Shen'dralar rejoined the Night Elven society when the Cataclysm was about to hit. Darnassus and the Alliance accepted their help, and now they have Highborne Mages training several Night Elves in the Arcane Arts, but now with way more caution. Maiev Shadowsong got rightfully furious because of this, showing that the writers didn't forget the hatred some Night Elves had for the Highborne.
---
For Human hunters, they alliance with Dwarves and other races who could Hunt provided stormwind with Hunter Trainers - Dwarven Hunters, to be more specific. Similar stuff for the faction Gnomeregan, but the Gnomes are more focused on *enhancing* the art of the hunt with their technology - especially mechanical pets.
---
Dont meme lag because the ping I got in 2006 with my dogshit connection was always yellow out of Chicago. 
---
Modern internet eu to na ping is infinitely better than most peoples ping in 2005 to a server 200 miles away.
---
Thanks. What are they charging for playing? Is it still the, what was it $9.99/mo, or something?
---
Only thing I was able to find is...
---
*Functionally similar to Lightning Shield, and got a new animation in 2.0
---
I think it would be cool to see previous expansions released on a similar release schedule to how it happened in real life. With those expansions, I think that you should keep the classic servers and create new servers for said expansions. Almost like how private servers have had the option of playing the version of WoW you like. As each expansion comes out, I think one of two things should happen:
---
1) Copy your character from the previous expansion over so that you can keep the connection to your character while keeping the player base happy that decides to play on the "older" content.
---
Or
---
2) Just make everyone start fresh. Plenty of us never took the time to enjoy the leveling in other content because we were all rushing from 60-70 or 70-80 etc... Things changed through the years and I know that I missed a lot of it because I never took the time to smell the roses.
---
Look, this has been debunked so many times and people need to understand something.
---
Vanilla wasn't hard. It was time consuming, but not hard. People are exaggerating the difficulty of this game to make it sound like they're some sort of pro player who only played when the game was hard.
---
No, the game is easy. It just takes time. It's still an amazing game. But the PVE is not hard.
---
Hard not to scream unlimited power when spamming mind flay in pvp.
---
I live in Holland and it's like 99% of all houses without airco. This is because it's only 'hot' for 1-2 months a year (not even full months). I think this is the same for the rest of Europe too.
---
We just use fans or those tower fans.
---
Mmmmm gimme that tusken helm
---
During the stress test I was waiting for a zeplin and chatting with this other dude who was there waiting as well.  Waited for a while.  Suddenly he disappeared, and the zeplin appeared out of knowhere already leaving and away from the zep tower.  I was like...wtf.  Then 10 seconds later another zeplin just appeared out of knowhere loaded with people who were all arriving.
---
I don't know about you, but I never did SM Cath at 30. And I'm willing to bet 99% of people here haven't done it either.
---
1. Probably due to middle of the road DPS out of all the DPS classes for Raids, and the infamous "Huntard" title of being a newb hunter not controlling your pet. There is also a hard learning curve with PvP as a hunter too, which I'm sure turns people off a bit. I don't think that includes BM though as that's a pretty straight forward tree.
---
2. They're OK. If I had to rate it E through S, tier-wise and S being top notch, I'd give them a B. Like I said, really tough learning curve and people who know how to play in your deadzone(especially casters) will absolutely destroy you.
---
3. Good luck and enjoy it. I used to play one and I loved it. I probably won't do it again this time around though.
---
Shadow priests melt faces in pvp
---
Coming from a recent private server, one of the best parts of vanilla wow is how well you learn the World because you simply have to traverse it. Places like Theramore Isle and Menithil Harbor are super important. Learning flight paths, etc. All of it I learned by heart by just playing. Its amazing
---
From what I remember they had originally designed for things like cloaks and shields as having variable requirements, like armor types (cloth/leather/mail/plate)
---
Different classes that cant use shields now were going to be able to use buckler shields. Cloaks would have had armor/class requirements, meaning the heavier full cloaks would have been restricted to higher armor types. All got scrapped, but it was an early design idea.
---
Hence the shitty small cloaks and tiny little bucklers
---
Find someone who accepts your hobbies.
---
My GF has a horse, she usually works til like 6pm, goes the stables til 8pm, comes home watches TV for 2hrs then goes to bed.
---
She's happy to watch her TV programs while I play on my PC. I do finish work at 4pm so it's my job to prepare food which I don't mind because I enjoy cooking. 
---
So I get a solid 7-8hrs of PC after work and she gets her time. Then 1 night a week we have a date night... People cringe when they hear how little time we spend sat together, but like, it works for us so who fkin cares.
---
We've been together for 5.5 years and lived together for 2.5 yrs, so it's definitely working for us.
---
It is hard to have hard evidence of something NOT existing. It's proving a negative. Someone needs to find evidence that is was usable back then.   
---
My comment on the situation is that I knew of and used the zoom script myself, but I DID NOT and DO NOT remember a script that adjusted nameplate view distance. And I knew a person in a high warlord grind group that I chatted with often. Unless they were incredibly secretive to prevent bans, I would have heard of it I'd think
---
Twink servers confirmed
---
The only issue I had with hunters is that in the original WoW, you could set up a one button macro for everything in the rotation and just spam it.  All the other classes required a little thought about switching up the rotation slightly to maximize raid DPS.
---
Shamans can gather herbs in wolf form, thing druids can in travel form as well.
---
A lot of people don't seem to think like this, when I play a tank I try to be a good level for x dungeon, find a good healer and try to get a diverse group for gear. Obviusly this is not requered for tanking, but a big part of being either good or bad at tanking
---
As warrior I‚Äôd remember the struggle leveling solo.
---
Lol why are you so upset? My bad for belittling your heroes accomplishments. It's not that deep.
---
to be honest while it is easier to level as dps its not impossible to level as tank/healer, i levelled a warrior 1-60 as tank with little to no issue, some mobs took longer to die but they didn't do me much damage so i could just tank them and kill them. also had a friend level 1-60 as disc priest and again didn't have a lot of problems, to be fair if you level as dps you have problems as well so its all fairly balanced .
---
with that in mind respec costs are there to stop people constantly chopping and changing specs, its something you have to put some thought into and make sure you understand that swapping back is going to cost more so if you are planning on going back be prepared for that
---
Hopefully they dont do that again. 
---
I wont spend 3 hours trying to login this time around. 
---
I learned my lesson from last time.
---
no, how you get that idea?
---
Level 19 was a huge one if I remember
---
I mean if they make new content past Naxx they could just barely increase the power of the gear, enough so people still want to do new raids but not enough to cause problems with power creep. Just small gains in power :) also new 5 mans would be fucking awesome.
---
Probably over saturated with Warriors is my best guess.  Rogues probably come in second.
---
Mages, Warlocks, and any healer will always be in demand.  I remembered always having issues doing things with my rogue and warrior.  Tanking was easy to find groups, but raiding was a different story.  You would never get tier drops over the MT and OT, and the offset plate items were rare and always in hot contention.
---
It's free with a regular subscription to retail wow. Which is 15 a month.
---
Hunters are not too dps and they do not scale the further the content progresses. In pvp they have a very high skill cap and most people were bad back in the day. In the end I think most people just want a class that can top dps (warrior) braindead raid dps (mage) or can absolutely dominate PvP both of the listed classes plus rogue. Hunter excelled at nothing specifically but has utility. The reason hunter is not more sought after is because I don‚Äôt think many people care about being a Swiss Army knife when they can be a machine gun. I‚Äôm either rolling hunter or warrior myself.
---
$14.99
---
Are you in hurry?
---
The old stereotype of huntards, which is true in that they're the easiest class to play, but they're actually one of the hardest to master in Vanilla. There's a *huge* gap between good and bad hunters. I was definitely a bad hunter in 2004ish and will be redeeming myself in Classic.
---
People are also aware in 2019 that while good in MC and BWL, they drop off massively after that in PVE. In PVP they're all round fun and powerful, in the right hands.
---
No. Just had limited time Today.
---
The same sub for Retail covers Classic.
---
I see. Yeah i understand that it can be annoying to some people.
---
the real thing will be explaining to wars that they need to pull with a gun
---
Hunters are pretty great, Go BM and you will have a pet that can beat most world content for you lol
---
In world PvP hunters are very good
---
their only down side is they are not the great raid DPS but they make up for it with some utility
---
1. Hunter's start strong but don't scale well throughout Classic PVE in terms of DPS. They also have the most complex PVE rotation of all classes with autoshot weaving.
---
2. Hunter is amazing in WPvP, BGs, and even duels in the right hands (though dueling radius limits their kiting abilities). Although they are easy to play on a basic level, managing your positioning, deadzone, and utility across multiple targets takes some serious skill. Hunter has the highest skillcap in PvP IMO, more so than Mage.
---
I loved playing my hunter. I would hunt for the boss pets, and pvp was fun. I built marksmen instead of beastmaster, so my dps was awesome in pvp. Loved that I can solo pve and worked well in groups/raids.
---
No, Dwarf.
---
Ok. Thanks for the Info. Deleting this post because damn... it's hostile.
---
15$ a month with not needing to buy the game.
---
You're going to be triggered to know a classic version of AAP is being worked on.
---
quest helper is the reason that retail has the markers that it has today and it was in vanilla.
---
do as i'm planning on doing, if you don't want to use it then dont, thats the  joy of addons like this if you feel it takes away from the feel of the game, and for me it does, the dont use it
---
I'm between a warlock and shaman.
---
Not if you're Horde levelling in Durotar/Barrens.
---
Save your boar meat and Scorpid Stingers. The cook in Razor Hill sells a recipe for Scorpid Surprise. That should get you to 70 cooking easily.
---
Save your strider meat. The trade vendor in XR sells Strider Stew recipe...AND Thunder Lizard Steak or something like that.
---
When you get to 100 cooking, you can learn the Thunder Lizard recipe. I usually just grind out levels 21 and 22 down by Camp T on those Stormsnouts anyway...I'll end up with tons of food, and cooking lvl 150 with basically zero extra effort.
---
Next stop is Hillsbrad and the Turtle Soup recipe, but you're gonna have to save up the gold and run to Dustwallow to buy the book.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
[Finkle's Skinner but it's fast attack speed.](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12709)
---
Might be good for tanks though trying to get hits.
---
Instead of victory rush we have hamstring.  What you do is get a mighty slow heavy hitter, swing and kite until you can swing again.  Those mobs might be able to attack you 2 to 3 times normally now they only attack when you attack.  Health get low?  Just grab first aid and cooking.  I have a priest so I'm spoiled.
---
For the first months or so, for the vast majority of people, they will be pulling one mob at a time. Because there will be a scarcity of mobs as we kill them all almost as soon as they spawn.
---
The biggest problem is that stormstrike adds debuffs and frost/flame shock to if the enhancement shaman actually added dps to the raid like say a shadow priest then there would maybe be a reason allocate 3 debuff slots to him as it is now whit only extra atrackpower on wf attacks there is not. And any shaman doing any where ner eaven tanks dps whit out using stormstrike or frost/flame shock no matter what gear and mana usages will have my vote. T2,5 is not really a enhancement sett, it is more a elemental set it lacks hitt chance and mele critt as a enhancement you kinda need close to 25% critt to keep flurry up. This is another glaring issue as enhancement you need mele hitt and spell hit you need mele and spell critt you need strength for AP agility and int for mele/spell crit there is just no gear that is actually good for you.
---
Never played a sham so it would be a new experience.
---
the stamina buff is about 10-15% max hp buff (from 1-30) and stacks with fort. as a warrior, it's been the diff between being able to kill most named quest mobs (like Den Mother) and needing help to do it.
---
There's a natural sort of disgust when everyone in the raid dies except the hunter, who feigned death well away from aggro range, too. At least paladins have to sacrifice themselves to save a rezzer.
---
We need the corpse running addon to be reestablished for full vanilla experience.
---
Hopefully it will also show population of the server. As it stands we have no idea how many servers there will be, or their names tbh. This will matter to me. Id reroll to a server named the same as my original vanilla server just on the chance to meet old friends again... but if its super low pop or crowded beyond belief there may be a decision to be made.
---
What's the point of life?
---
Does anyone have a good list of the chronological order for these?  Or a good place to buy then in the UK?
---
Pocket healer few :).  Thanks!
---
I love you for that gem
---
You‚Äôre implying that these streamer clips are going to make more people play the game.
---
As mentioned. Its Just for example
---
I got in day 1 and im neither of those things. In fact most of the people there day 1 werent if /1 was to be believed. 
---
Also i know for and fact FnF lists still arent complete and some arent in game yet
---
Also - Archeus is legit.  I still X-mog my pally to that and Verigan's Fist in retail.
---
&gt;  It does not speed up your leveling. Not even close. The amount of cloth you get from leveling can cover first aid, which is arguably a much stronger profession to keep up to your level than tailoring, meaning you cannot level both without taking extra time grinding. 
---
Locks/Mages/Priests shouldnt need bandages to lvl? Locks heal in combat and have 2x regen, Mages make their own food/water, and priests can just heal themsleves with a renew. 
---
Got to the azure set with 0 cloth farming thats frost spell power, only time lost was crafting, which can be done on boats/zeps/trams, downtime in dungeons, waiting for a specific mob to spawn, and just times when you click create 60x and go for a shit. As I mentioned the shadowsilk set is positioned in a lvl bracket where you are not getting the amount of quests you need to lvl on them alone and you need to grind, I dont see how grinding mobs you need for tailoring is a waste vs grinding mobs you do not need for tailoring.
---
Because doing both lets you avoid grinding and doing the shittiest quests.
---
higher health pool compared to higher mitigation also means it exhausts healer mana faster
---
Or you‚Äôre just blind to the possibility that blizzard has this wrong right now and some private servers are closer to the original values.
---
And the people who made classic went on to make Wildstar, so before we line up to suck their dicks, remember they got lucky and don't really understand why their own game was a success.
---
That's how itb
---
 used to be.
---
If everyone is forced to do raids from the beginning to advance to the next xpac then it would have been seen as normal. But doing it now is pointless. 
---
I would have made legendary weapons upgradable or another way to make them stronger and usefull in the next xpac untill you atleast get into heroic dungeons.
---
They are legendaries for a reason. And yes im only talking about legendaries here not epics. Those should last until normal tier dungeons imo.
---
I didn‚Äôt use talent points, like ever.  I was so afraid of the talent point screen I just never used it.
---
i'm only using a guide to make sure i get all of the quests before i do an instance.
---
Since the point was to stress the servers, they wanted to keep as many people as possible concentrated in the same area 
---
Capping at 5 makes sure people aren‚Äôt wandering off too far
---
And then you run RFD and get Icemetal Barbute before you can actually use it... and stare at it in your inventory until you hit 40.
---
That's what beta is for.
---
In situations such as this, I recommend a good pair of running shoes.
---
Not at all. Her extent of video game experience is Mario Party.
---
Stam and Spirit are really good stats while leveling.  They dramatically cut down on the probability of dying and increase your recovery between fights.
---
Cooking is never a waste of time, even if you can probably hit 60 faster without it.
---
Yeah, sorry, I should probably have worded it better. More, can anyone find any footage of anyone using the extended camera back in 2004-06. 
---
I'm in your camp, I'm sure I remember the camera script working (though it was so long ago it could be a different expansion), but also never heard of the nameplate thing.
---
Path of exile and Final Fantasy XIV
---
No, classic Wow
---
Oh shit I just remembered that we once had a shaman tank one of Garr's adds
---

---
Come on now, the streamers are milking the hell out of classic right now.  I'm not saying the game isn't fun but you can tell they are already running out (or have ran out) of stuff to do. 
---
Do you guys really think all these guys like Asmon or Sodapoppin are going to do what they are doing now when it actually launches?  No, they are going to rush to 60 ASAP by whatever means possible.
---
That's what layering is for.
---
&gt; Could someone with access confirm this behavior on the classic beta?  
---
Here's a few clips from beta.

---
I remember only the TBC version, and it looked as you described (little shadowy orbs floating around).
---
I think the problem isn't just playing hybrid.
---
It's that playing hybrid, as you described, pretty much pigeon-holes you into being in a casual guild, when you want to be hardcore but your preferred spec is so shit that it's considered meme.
---
(Unless you have a friend/guild that is willing to carry a few meme builds, but most hardcore guilds won't and are just stacking war/mage/lock/hunter)
---
This is a great idea to wait in summer till 27 august. I have never read any of the books, seems like a good time to do it
---
Because that made the game easier for the least common denominator types that don't care about that kind of thing. It allowed them to attract the whale audience that just wants to show up get loot and pay for mtx. Requiring social interaction to get loot? Thats slow and doesn't print money with mtx.
---
A majority of those deaths are die to alliance players healing the npcs.
---
You can always spec shadow for pvp and switch to your healing set for raid. Most healers in casual guilds are "hybrid" specced.
---
I think leveling with professions - even if it slows things down - is one of the funnest parts of leveling from classic/BC when I played. One of my biggest problems with the revamped leveling is that if you tried to have professions and complete all the quests in a zone you reached the top of the level range halfway through the zone. But I was also a young player who had no interest in end game content and just liked to do leveling and RP content.
---
Because FFXI used horizontal progression and WoW uses vertical progression. Equipment in FFXI had way more uses in FFXI because you can swap gear in combat, so you would swap gear pieces to cast a particular spell. 
---
Like imagine if you swap tier sets on a per-spell basis, while in combat.
---
Haha yea I‚Äôm on mobile and My auto correct is dumb
---
Hmm I thought the winking smiley would have been enough of a clue but thank you for correcting my obviously tongue in cheek post!
---
On a private server last night I said "Next time you pull when I am low on mana, I am going to finish my drink before standing up".
---
They slowed down after that.  Doubt it would work as well on retail servers but when wipes cost you about 5 minutes, and finding a new person can cost you 30+ if the group is actually able to survive, people tend to be willing to slow down a bit.
---
This tired meme be like ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
I still think ‚ÄúRallying Cry of the Dragonslayer‚Äù is by far the coolest buff name ever.
---
How do i cut out work to maximize my playtime?
---
A majority of those deaths are due to Alliance players healing the npcs. I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried when classic drops there won‚Äôt be any twinks for awhile.
---
Make a commitment to your guild to show up to 100% of the raids.  Work with them to create a raid schedule that allows this.  You definitely will not have the time to prep for raids, so you will need the support of your guild.  Many guilds funnel consumables to their raiders, so it's certainly possible.  It will take a lot of persuasion and effort to prove to your guild that you are worth supporting.
---
Great idea actually, side-talent-trees that are either 'reset' with each expansion (so we know they are temporary, and the loss isn't as harsh), or they are invalid outside of that specific expansion's content? hmm
---
Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen
---
Its contested for the same reason that redridge is.  An introduction to world pvp in a zone that should be favored for your faction.
---
But think about it guys. When they want a real stress test they are going to open beta, not 100% but i can feel it. Why test just streamers and some vanilla players when they know the real deal comes out they need an idea of what the 25mil is gonna be like. Exaggerated numbers idk what blizzard does anymore but i say hang in there...2months. Ima keep my sub for now just in case.
---
I've never heard of a "Single Spec" if that's what you mean. I thought Dual Spec was something everyone did instinctually considering there's nothing holding someone back from putting points into multiple trees. Unless you're just referring to specifically 21/30 builds of many kinds? There are actually even weirder builds than that that prove to be more effective for pve/raid/pvp depending on class.
---
Yes I'd love it if they never added flying mounts. Hell, I'd love it if they never added new levels and just added more 60 zones tuned for BWL+ geared players.
---
Of course you want them to chill... they called you out on your shit after you tried to fight with everyone.
---
ah! No, they will not. But streamers on twitch will bring people on.
---
Of course as mentionned before its for casual guilds. You wont be in the top guild of the server but you'll still be clearing content... Eventually.
---
the issue with hunters is that there are normally a lot of them as they are an easy solo class. They are easy to play, and hard to master. There are less good hunters about, as players can get lazy who play them. 
---
I loved playing my hunter and they are great in BGs. Normally there is a lot going on in front of you....so a hunter can and normally will get away with nuking down players involved in close combat with another player. Just need to watch for rogues jumping you...so track hidden and sitting on traps helps. 
---
They have good kite ability, and played well, they have great burst DPS so can nuke down clothies fast. 
---
In raids, they require less heals, and if played well can totally hold their own, even into Naxx - despite what folk say. 
---
A GOOD hunter, is always heavily sought after!
---
The most underrated thing about food buffs is the extra spirit it gives. Spirit is really good for leveling for every class because it gives both, health and mana regen. The health regeneration is still really good on manaless classes and saves a ton of time throughout your leveling journey
---
A shield is all you need gear wise to tank lower dungeons.  Holding agro is the tough part.  Even a grey shield is going to give you more armor than everyone else which is why shaman can tank.
---
I would simply disagree with them. Mage plays with smaller margins than hunter, and players can shrug off an undergeared mage easier than a hunter. 
---
All that said, these are generalities. A geared mage will blow people up and a hunter does take above average skill to be top tier.
---
Start with ep3. The series counts in reverse. Ep3, 2 then 1.
---
Source: I was in his guild, the warrior at the beginning of ep1 ‚Äúlooking for members uppa blackrock spire‚Äù was our mt. Ep 3 was released while I was leveling, 2 when we were in mc and 1 as we were starting bwl.
---
Is DI in vanilla? I can't remember, but I do remember at some point when I raided earlier expansions as paladin's people fighting over my DI (which healer) just to save repair costs because they are a real bitch.
---
There is no point to when Discord handles literally everything.
---
I imagine Server Discord channels will eventually be a thing.
---
I would say none. There have been so many retcons that the game manuals until TBC are a better source.
---
But regardless of that, avoid anything written by Golden or Knaak.
---
I mean you can still do all of those things in retail.  Even in the new expansion you can remove quest markers, read quests, get lost in zones, wander around, etc.
---
If you play it as rush to max, rush to raid ilvl, mythic raid, etc that is how YOU are choosing to play the game.
---
In my experience back in vanilla, the reason for the "huntard" title was this: hunters were the easiest SOLO class, so easy in fact, that the vast majority of group quests could be completed without then ever grouping. This had the unfortunate result being that some hunters (not all) literally didn't know how to play the game with others. And then they are thrust into a high level dungeon or start raiding and they don't know what to do. More accurately, "they know what to do!" in that they play like they always had: GO PET, GO! 
---
So, if you play a hunter, spend time while leveling grouping with others and learning that aspect of the game. If you that, you'll be fine.
---
Elder scrolls fixed this issue with level scaling and gearing through sets. So as new content comes out you that you wanna progress, you don't lose the 20 other raids you COULD do. And those  raids may have sets for your build that could suck on every other character but bis for you. I wanna see this concept in How's future so I can be level 150 bloodlust spamming sunwell like the good ol' days.
---
Also LoLing
---
Hunters are essentially the gods of solo play, as they are by far the strongest solo PvE class (able to solo mobs that might normally take 2 players of other classes to beat), and are also one of the strongest solo/world PvP classes, with a decent claim to being THE best.
---
However, the counterpart to this is that they lag behind other DPS options in organised group play (raiding moreso than battlegrounds), which is the sole focus of most of the hardcore playerbase that frequents this sub. They're still used in both raids and battlegrounds for their utility (CC options and Aspect of the Pack in particular) but once you have enough, you really don't want anymore. They also have worse gear scaling than other classes, since a large chunk of their damage comes from their pet, which doesn't get gear upgrades. This means they start off pretty strong in early raids, but drop off once other classes start getting kitted out in purple.
---
&gt;Will a casual shadow priest pve'er get a chance to raid in classic
---
&gt; I'm thinking of maining a shadow priest because I like to offheal my buddies when we play together or do pvp 
---
This is your mistake. Healing as shadow means you do 0 damage, doing damage as shadow means you do 0 healing. Classic Shadowform does not allow you to use heals of any kind, including PWS.
---
Gnome is better in this case since he will be more in sync with his character.  Role playing increases mental focus and determination.  Can't discount the psychological effects in PvP.  Sometimes intimidation and the resulting hesitation alone can turn a fight.
---
I was talking to 1 guy, and I didn't read the main thread carefully enough, and I also said what I (ME) prefer, not the others.
---
You all seem so mad
---
Just remember the golden rule of dating.
---
Never meet your wife at the club, once a thot always a thot
---
Right when I was thinking I was at peak classic hype, this comment appears
---
People recreating Classic doesn't mean you're going to be good at designing content for Classic.
---
Preach said it best, it feels so good to not be a god of destruction and for your mistakes to be punishing
---
its going to be hard to get in a cutting edge guild as shadow but... a casual guild will be happy to have you if you are skilled, especially if you are smart and willing to drop out of shadow form and heal in emergencies 
---
so in short, be skilled, make friends, dont expect to be in a hardcore guild
---
&gt;I‚Äôd really rather not have a dragon kited into my city at level 30
---
God forbid people have fun right? Not being able to turn in your quest in Stormwind for 5 more minutes until the NPC respawns is such a horrible tragedy.
---
High skill cap, easiest/fastest to level.  This made for a concoction of younger/lesser skilled individuals playing the majority of hunters.
---
I played my hunter in classic to Rank 14.  I can tell you the difference between a Hunter who knows what he is doing and one who plays "bare minimum" is BLATANTLY apparent.  If you play a hunter well, you will absolutely stomp every class in PVP minus maybe a Shadow Priest. I'm talking about Rogue/Warrior as well.  With practice, these will be the easiest classes to deal with. 
---
As for PVE, I raided with the #2 guild on my server.  Playing intelligently and understanding the mechanics of your rotation will give you 2X the damage of a hunter spamming a "DPS MACRO" button.  Being able pull your weight and then-some with utility on fights like Razorgore really make you shine. 
---
The reason for so little love is because it took a lot to play it well.  It took more than most hunters cared to invest in learning because the bare minimum was enough.  Your shit DPS was accepted because the majority did shit DPS.  As Vanilla progressed, even if you played well, you dropped in DPS in comparison to other classes. It was a constant trend of hunters not excelling even when played by the best of the best.
---
Damn dude, your post history is full of you shitting on people for how they live their life. Project much?
---
you'll either be playing as a cat or bear!
---
lol the name would be helpful
---
https://pvp.henhou.se/
---
Berserking + life Tap would be amazing.
---
Not to mention that the better your mitigation gear gets, the less rage you generate.
---
So leave the clips on twitch and stop posting them here.
---
What if I'm a tryhard though?
---
I want to rinse in proper pvp spec and do respectable dps on my rogue. That's not possible in 1 spec, so I have to spend 100g per week on respecs because blizzard arbitrary chose 50 as the cap and none though further about it.
---
Lollllllllll
---
And that's about it :T
---
Consumable stacking and dot snapshotting are sorta difficult to test at our level on beta.
---
Indeed very important for paladins when it comes to procs.
---
It also affects crusader/fiery procs and other weapon procs.
---
Also it'd be nice to check what's the proc rate on seal/judge of light. Iirc seal is ppm and judgement is about 60% in the most popular pserver. I really wanna know what are the real blizzlike values.
---
Hunters in vanilla were a running joke of being retarded. Huntards was prevalent in vanilla.
---
I‚Äôve got a couple of them from actual retail vanilla... 
---
The first being hitting level 12 in the open beta, and moving on to Darnassus and eventually Dark Shore.  When I first arrived at Auberdine, the realization that this was literally a MASSIVE world finally hit me and was awe inspiring.
---
The second being my first run through an instance (Deadmines) with my brother.  We both thought it was amazing how awesome the gear was, and we felt rich after accumulating over 1g after finishing.
---
After that, all my memories are PvP related... my first time entering STV and spendings an entire day engaging in world PvP / gank fights completely unplanned.
---
Not sure why, but I have a vivid memory of fighting an Undead rogue in WPL for a couple of hours at level 52.  We just kept fighting each other 
---
Also at level 52 in Felwood.. there was a Warrior on our server named Adak that all my close circle of friends considered an absolute god at PvP.  I was stealthing around and came across him farming something (not sure what).  I waited for him to get overwhelmed and jumped and ended up killing him.  Sent a SS to my friends and they thought I photo shopped it and called me a liar for claiming I killed him.
---
And then hitting rank 9 on my druid (don‚Äôt know why I remember rank 9 specifically and none of the other ranks).  And also my first 45 minute baron run also on my druid.
---
give it 6 months.... and the same will be said
---
its just a craze now because its new and not fully released
---
You will do good with a class you like and suck with one you don't. Watch videos, figure out what playstyles appeal to you and go from there.
---
Why would I care that my house is a dumpster fire when I'm in Azeroth all the time anyways?
---
For exemple for Druids there are usually a few specs refered as raid specs. Like Moonglow thats basically 24/0/27 or like the imp regrowth spec for late tier or resto shams who basically puts almost all points into resto talents.
---
Hybrid spec is basically get the most important talent in healing tree so youre still raid viable and rest go get some pvp talents for the fun.
---
*gasp* You mean a game forces players to make tradeoffs instead of being the best at everything all the time?
---
Gotta stay hydrated
---
This is exactly my approach as well.  I know that if you want to truly level "efficiently" you should pretty much skip all of the dungeons on your way to 60.  But like you, I wont have the time to be a head of the pack in terms of leveling, so whats the point of sweating super hard to get 60?  You can bet that I am gonna take the time to gather as many quests for each dungeon as possible and to find a group for each dungeon because that is the shit that made Vanilla fun.
---
Those players exist, but there's also players who might dabble or might be interested in a 9.0, 10.0.
---
Maybe they're just tourists for new content, maybe they're only playing Classic because of the sorry state of retail, but that doesn't mean they might not be interested in future stuff.
---
Correction, raids bring zero to one shadow priest.
---
It's really not a raid viable spec, that is only brought for shadow weaving to buff the warlocks. But even then, you're more likely to see a PI disc priest with talents for shadow weaving, who will spam rank 1 mind flay 5 times to get the stacks and then go to healing.
---
But will some raids bring 1? Yeah, probably. Will they bring a casual SPriest? Maybe if you are insanely lucky. SPriest is a PvP class, and if a guild wants to fill their raid and is willing to bring 1 SPriest, there's plenty of competitive people to ask. As a casual player, you might get into some MC/Ony PUGs or fill for ZG or something but I wouldn't expect to have a guaranteed raid seat in any sort of progression raiding guild.
---
No idea but since you pretty much don't use bleeds at all and when you do it's very minimal part of your dps, I don't think however the mechanic works matters at all.
---
I would still prefer dwarf over rogue XD
---
That's why I also level fishing. If cooking falls behind, I just have to find the recipe for whatever fish will help level up cooking.
---
Just because I'm a tryhard doesn't mean I have endless amounts of gold. 
---
I want to rank on classic, and I'm sure as hell not gonna give up raiding. For the 12 weeks minimum that I need to rank, that is 1200 gold over an entire epic mount in just respecs, then comes consumes for pvp/pve.
---
I would‚Äôve believed that too back then üòÖ
---
was always good at the Lumber mill in AB, mindcontroling players and making them jump to their death!
---
He's talking about the dual spec system introduced in WotLK. Rather than a single spec that you had to pay to retrain, players were allowed to have 2 whole separate talent point configurations they were allowed to chose from. So for example a priest might have a holy setup for when they raid and a shadow setup for when they want to pvp. Even within a single focus, for example shadow priest, a priest might have a pve spec focused on efficiency and group buffing and a pvp focused spec with more emphasis on survivability.
---
Basically this system meant that rather than thinking about the various tradeoffs one would have to make in their spec to support the different modes of gameplay, everybody got to be the best of everything all the time, which was idiotic.
---
Exactly. This is one of the many super hyped up things about classic. 
---
On the other hand, I think some people just instantly hate anything that Asmon or his fans enjoy. Regardless of whether they would normally enjoy it themselves.
---
honestly i thought they would add gbanks to classic. i know they weren't in vanilla but it was a very useful change that i half expected them to add in just for the convenience of it for players (especially ones coming from retail who never played vanilla). it doesn't matter much to me though, we'll just go back to having an alt as a gbank.
---
From the threads I've read on classic mods, it's usually easy to take a retail mod and mod it to work for classic. So I'd develop on retail, then mid it back whenever you get access to Classic. Be it a future stress test or the release. If you do it on retail, you might also be able to find a mod dev that had beta and is willing to work with you to clean it up for classic.
---
I did druid healing in vanilla so I'd be down to heal again this time around. I've got a newborn so my time will be limited and it'll be easier to get a raid spot as a casual being a healer. Also sham have fun PvP.
---
Good old classic when professions actually meant something.
---
Even the secondary ones.
---
Honestly, Joana's 1-60 *unedited* leveling video is the most authentic source for a hunter.  You'll see *exactly* what it is like to level through the zones.  The only thing better would be playing it yourself.  To be fair, it's grainy and low quality because back in 20004, there wasn't the HD there is today.  At least not for recording while playing.  Here's a link to the part one:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwLjJH8LXfc&amp;list=PL49Ga\_-r7iKkxrbckm9CkUhWzxqrOnw-n&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwLjJH8LXfc&amp;list=PL49Ga_-r7iKkxrbckm9CkUhWzxqrOnw-n&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s)
---
Well, not really. Beta is pretty limited and won't have much bearing on live server populations. Unless you're talking about specifically just bugs. Then, yea, hopefully it will be all worked out when the game goes live.
---
I'm thinking everyone will want to DPS warrior and OT to get their gear.
---
Do you need a subscription to be able to get it?
---
I remember you could make Prince in Kara back up by doing this, however that is BC and I don't recall needing to do this on too many bosses in Vanilla. I attempted to find a video of it but I can't.
---
You make a compelling point. Here are the reasons I no longer play: On my main up-to-level char, everything is rinse and repeat. Playing the game feels like a repetitive task from a job over me playing it to enjoy myself.
---
Tired to create a new character to get that whole RPG experience again, you know, explore the area and enjoy the story of that zone... Nah, all levels are rushed so you enter a new zone, are barely half way into the zone's quest story and you ready to move to next area. 
---
I had a hunter I had not played in a LONG time, he was like 62 and I left him just about to enter Zangramarsh or whoever you spell it. I wanted to relive the experience of leveling a character so I decided to do this guy, seeing as outland was an INSANELY awesome map/expansion and I am a LK fanboy so everything WotLK was my favorite. I go into the first town of Zang, start questing.... Before I get to the second quest hub, I was already level 67, meaning I could just skip Terokkar Forest, Nagrand, maybe Blade Edge Mountins and go straight to Shadowmoon/Netherstorm... I then further realize changed everything to be YOUR level instead of the actual zones, so I realized I could have skipped Outland all together and just reached 70-80 from questing anywhere in the game lol Once I did the initial's patch worth of content, unsubscribed and have not touched it sense.
---
I used to play 3-5 hours DAILY for 6-7 days a WEEK durning Vanilla, TBC, WotLK... Now I will maybe play it if it was free to play and did not take so much space on my PC.
---
Should probably go with a hybrid of Assassination/Sub.  Hemorrhage with a slow sword or mace was really solid of pve.  And then you have prep and cold blood plus some additional pvp perks.
---
Does anyone know if there will be armory for Classic characters. That way people will know your spec and gear and honor rank and stuff.
---
I know what you‚Äôre saying, but this is a click bait title.  I usually disagree with threads like this on principle... 
---
But I think it‚Äôs just nostalgia.  Classic wow is like the Pok√©mon movie.  We are going to be able to relive a little part of that life.  So I think classic is going to crush current wow, at least for a little
---
I don't believe the polls either because what people say then log on and create will be two separate things haha.
---
Buy enough Noggenfoggers to be non-tauren 24/7. Or edit the game files so your model is a gnome.
---
"Oh... I thought you were gonna say pizza or hot dogs or something... but you want Classic."
---
"Have you ever tried Classic?"
---
"No."
---
"You are going to... LOVE IT!"
---
without AR you will lose a lot of dps
---
When I say pvp viable I mean you can still kill people with it unlike lets say a shaman that wanna play dps but is full resto to raid. See the nuance? Combat rogue still can kill shit.
---
Heal heals, tank tanks, dps does dps
---
Phase 1*
---
This is also why they should just leave TBC and other expansions be.  If Classic is hugely successful and they see value in doing more to keep players subbed for legacy servers, I think it would be better if they rebuilt it as a horizontal progression version of WoW.
---
You can only track one type of gathering node at a time on the minimap, so doubling up wouldn't be worth it imo.
---
It would be much more likly in MC I would think, Garr being a thing and all, and once your in weekly, no one is going to try and make you change
---
Jabroni... cool word.
---
But they can't.
---
A full resto shaman is gonna destroy any combat rogue.
---
Awesome.  Thank you!
---
Very true.  If everyone of all classes just focused on min maxing, then the overall effectiveness of raid groups would decrease.  If sword rogue is bis and all rogues hold out for swords and ignore daggers, then you'll be waiting many more weeks to outfit rogues with swords while you DE those daggers (lol).  Even if equipping those rogues with the daggers in the meantime, they've been learning muscle memory for swords and won't be as efficient with daggers as with swords.  Yes, this is a (somewhat) dumb argument (that I'm having with no one in particular), but I like the smooth diversity that comes when people just play what they want instead of cookie cutter min maxing.
---
The Chad leveler
---
Right, I know what a hybrid spec is. I just didn't think anyone, at all, went into a full single tree and feared or avoided Dual/Tri Spec. I've never heard of or seen a Sin-Spec before in all of my WoW years from Vanilla to WOTLK. 
---
It should just be called Sin-Spec(because it's sinful to do this, you bastard), Dual-Spec, or Tri-Spec. Is this mostly a Shaman or Druid thing to do? I didn't see many of those healers so maybe that's why. In PvP or general PvE I recall seeing them invest in multiple trees of course.
---
SM with two friends until 5 in the morning. I used to talk to them on ventrilo with soundboards for the lulz. Execute competitions to see who could crit the highest, as we were all arms warriors. Finally earning enough to buy an epic mount. So many good ones.
---
That‚Äôs too bad about their diamant√©
---
Wouldn't you die from only 4 hours of sleep a night before a year is up... maybe not, but geez.
---
Nice choice. By the time you finish Witcher 3 + the DLCs, Classic will be in Phase 3!
---
Amplify Magic increases mana gains from life tap
---
These people are the reason you're getting classic and not a pristine bfa server. The community has been hard at work keeping blizzard on the right track, being critical of things that aren't vanilla is a cornerstone of this project and letting things go just because Activision blizzard "has been working so hard to give us classic" is absolutely not the way to go, Activision blizzard wants to work as little as possible and still make money. Be grateful to the people who kept them in check, not the company trying to make money off you.
---
u/FluzooTV
---
How do you kill that, which has no life?
---
That's next level maths!
---
Guess you need to l2p without offense but Ive seen plenty of sword rogues destroy warriors and many casters in duels.
---
That one had actual evidence backing it up.  This one is based on the creator's feelings.
---
OH. Got you. Thanks fella. I was mixing up terms in my brain.
---
&gt; Hemorrhage with a slow sword or mace was really solid for pve. 
---
If you're raiding others may get upset because Hemo takes a debuff slot, FYI.
---
Sounds like classic isn‚Äôt for you then tbh. That‚Äôs part of the way the game was. I used to spend 100g a week to respec. I was MT for my guild. It didn‚Äôt bother me much then. Now I don‚Äôt have the time for all that so I‚Äôll probably just spec PvP and be in a non-cutting edge guild. The game play is more fun for me so I‚Äôm really looking forward to it.
---
Is this E-S rating some sort of meme? I‚Äôve seen it and I literally don‚Äôt get it.
---
Whats the CD on AR?
---
Because tanking is hard and stressful, and everyone blames the tank when things go wrong.
---
I would be on board if they could find a way to deal with iLvl inflation. I love how Ultima handled this - items lose permanent durability and eventually break.
---
Wait, is Leroy Jenkins in your group?
---
My best mate tried to convince me of this, but I guess I just hate bag clutter too much and get rid of most of the useable shit
---
That's not what the quote says. Try reading it again.
---
Hi, /u/Gnilvert
---
Mage is way more fun in PvP
---
The only thing stopping you from pulling 4-5 elites was threat.  It was very hard to keep them off your healers if you did that without CC.  A competently geared/specced tank could easily survive quite a while against 4-5 mobs.
---
Thanks, this is exactly what I was gonna say
---
I'm not sure I understand that sentence
---
Not that I'm aware of. It's a very old-as-time basic Tier system. S Tier, A Tier, B Tier, C Tier, D Tier, E Tier.

---
Looking at this video, we can clearly see that friendly flag carrier is visible AND tracked on the map (notice the small map under his minimap). However, enemy flag carrier is not visible on the map at any time.
---
The game jus reflexes me to buy gold to be able to raid and PvP effectively. 
---
The game would be better with dual specs.
---
That should be macroable and tied to the mount and dismount action buttons
---
by the time they implement the honor system, you're probably going to have 10k gold, so don't worry
---
my rule for tanking is that if you pull aggro you're tanking it.
---
Oh you're absolutely right. The issue is that people aren't used to that and don't listen sometimes. We've got over a decade of facerolling to forget. For many people, this will take time.
---
I mean I can‚Äôt write question as a post on reddit without feeling the wrath of the internet warriors on me. It‚Äôs time to chill. 
---
Reminds me of WoW back in the day asking a simple question in trade chat and the whole server went bananas calling you a noob while the real answers came through whispers from actual goof people.
---
well to me it kind of boils down to a wide/tall gameplay preference. in Civ V there where a lot of multipliers, so that meant if you planned everything out very meticulously you could get massive yields on a 4-6 city empire that nothing else could beat. in Civ VI they got rid of basically all the multiplier mechanics and the happiness system that limited how many cities you could make without penalty. Basically what this means is that now the meta is ICS (infinite city sprawl), you want as many cities as possible because each one gives flat yields and there's nothing stopping you from spamming cities except your neighbors. So basically in Civ V you had your little plot of land you carefully micromanaged and in Civ VI you pump settlers and military and try to get huge as fuck. This is just my take on the topic, there are lots of other reasons you might like one of the games over the other.
---
TBC was in no way a strict improvement, it was just as mediocre as the other expansions. Stop spreading this nonsense.
---
I don't understand why lots of people in this subreddit seems to believe that blizzard are doing everything they can to fail at classic. There is zero reason for them to intentionally fail the game. I'm pretty sure that they want to make money and a good way of doing that is proving a game ppl want to continue playing. So yes if they say that they have read the potential issue tested it on an internal 1.12 server and seen that the numbers are correct I do believe them. They have no reason to lie and as far as I know they have never lied befor. Sure there are alot of decisions they have made that I'm not a fan of but they have not lied
---
Pretty sure u can use Disc spells such as PWS
---
As someone who lived through attunement with no guild in the first year of BC, it was such a huge pain in the ass. And you felt like an ass because you were inconveniencing so many other people just so you could enter current content. IDK, I just don't think it was as wonderful as we all remember.
---
No one was in full plate by the time they hit 45...
---
I ended up choosing mage due to quality of life benefits.  Free food and water, portals, more raid spots, not having to farm up soul shards before a raid, not having to have bag soacr taken up by soul shards.  I will likely make a lock alt but mage will be my main.
---
Server says perplexity is ~100ms behind where they are. And client-side, the rogue is further ahead than where the server shows they are. So it would be the combined amount.
---
Rogue sees on its computer that it's right in melee with perplexity, so it executes an attack and local logic says "yep, looks like you're in range".
---
Definitely hoping this sees a fix. It‚Äôs too drastic of a difference to situational awareness, totally changes the game.
---
Yeah that is the other option I was looking at. Most raids would only want 1 Hemo rogue though right?
---
Actually think Tauren were locked to only-Kodo, because they weighed more than most of the other mounts.
---
Work with eye of kilrog, or because that works a bit different no?
---
hahahaha. I can't wait for them to make another Episode just for Classic now.
---
Mages are overplayed and too easy.
---
This depends a lot on the type of player, right? I barely finished MC back in the day. 90% of my Classic time was levelling alts, and I loved it. My suspicion is that ultra-casual play like this was by far the most common type.
---
If you're going dagger spec I highly suggest putting 5 points into Sub for the Opportunity talent. 20% increase to ambush AND backstab is no joke.
---
No they'll send you to prison for life or you'll get the chair for doing something so heinous.
---
It's fine and perfectly easy to do, takes like 5-10m too if you use a repack.
---
Warlocks create so much threat you have to limit your play style. Because of that I will choose a mage
---
Oh yeah true. Sorry.
---
yeah but everyone knows the diamant√© is the real pain in vanilla overall
---
Yeah but after the first dungeon or two more people will realize by the time they get to, Scarlet Monastary, for example, which is actually a tougher dungeon
---
Pretty much.  Everyone remembers how OP fury warriors were, but I think people are forgetting how hard it was to gear them.
---
On my server, I really only remember a handful of super geared dps warriors.  And I had I played a holy priest for a AQ40 guild and they would never allow me to run with my warrior for any reason.
---
The muscle memory thing is really stupid. It's very similar specs. 
---
But yes, you want to spread out the specs of the rogues so that they all have sick weapons.
---
Or the people you seen the sword rogues face need to l2p?
---
I couldn‚Äôt decide so I had my Mage on a PvP server and my alliance warlock on PvE. They‚Äôre both fun and viable in everything.  The deciding factor for me was the fun of being a pet class and a free level 40 mount, and lots of cool quests.
---
Retail is nothing more than a PC version of a Cell Phone game.  
---
You are rewarded for playing less and not being in a community.
---
basically this post right here. 
---
My best memmories from starting the game is me and 3 friends playing together, warrior had cooking and blacksmithing, hunter leather working and me alchemy. Each of us trading stuff to each other and talking like:"omg this food, extra armor and potions will help me so frakin' much" and just beeing so happy about the little things.
---
Good times! So glad they will be back again :D
---
Yeah, I was amazed on the private servers when I went to druid tank.  In the same instance(ST) I had about 1k more HP than most of the warrior tanks I had healed, and that was in my full kitty gear(had not built a tank set yet).
---
I did take more damage, but with such a large health pool the healers could cast their big heals without worrying about me immediately dropping.
---
Did anyone get an invite to this stress-test but not the last one? I'm trying to figure out when to lose the rest of my hopes.
---
I've played classic for 4 years. I can handle the 100g per week yes, but it's stupid and pointless based on arbitrary numbers that blizzard never truly tested, and I would PREFER it being changed. I'm not saying it's a must at all, I'm simply saying that 25g respec is better and healthier for the game.
---
Original Lightning's Blade NA players,
---
We have a facebook group of over 180 members of original lightnings blade players regrouping for classic wow launch.    feel free to msg me for more information
---
I believe you're one expansion early to be prepared.
---
the dragon completely wiped the horde :)
---
Bro, I got that hammer in beta, and cryed little tears of Sadness for having vendored it off my pally back in the day
---
I disagree with adding content, but hypothetically speaking if content were to be added I would suggest no catch up mechanics. Catch up is one of the major issues with retail and imo why shouldn't a new player or an alt have to progress through all the content before getting to play the new stuff?
---
I was in the same boat but I chose Mage. I'm a PvPer and want to world Pvp... and I had to decide whether I wanted to counter melee or counter casters in Pvp. I decided that playing Mage and shitting all over the enormous about of Rogues and Warriors would be more satisfying, especially considering the amount of Rogues and Warriors that will be in Classic. Rogues and Warriors are so @#$%ing annoying that its nice being the one *they* are afraid of for once. Less stress in the world too, since I won't have to worry about being ganked as much and can turn the fight around on any opportunistic Rogue. Yea, I'll get rekt by Locks and Spriests‚Ä¶ but I feel like, personally, that's less annoying and frustrating than getting manhandled by melee all day... plus Spriests and Locks will probably be less common than Rogues and Warriors.
---
Trying to get some values in:
---
[http://classicdb.ch/?item=8094](http://classicdb.ch/?item=8094)
---
White plate lvl 45 has more than 3 times the armor of 
---
[http://classicdb.ch/?item=2470](http://classicdb.ch/?item=2470)
---
If this is about the same ration for blue or greens and on different levels (which is a good guess) the armor changes by +200% when you go from leather to plate. If you don't cap (unlikely) this means the remaining damage you get is cut in third (because that is the linear look at the formula meaning if you double your armor starting at 50% reduction it cuts the remaining damage in half to 75% reduction / 25% remaining). This is huge unless you fight against mages. Your 14% is totally unlikely. More likely it is 14 percent points like changing from 74 to 60% (this is about 30% more damage) but that is still unlikely looking at the armor values I just looked up. 
---
For a blue pair:

[http://classicdb.ch/?item=9473](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9473)
---
is also about 1:3 (even more in this case) so I think the case is valid.
---
That is true, I do plan on farming about 5k gold before phase 2, but I would much prefer leveling an alt in that time rather than spamming gold farming methods.
---
Yes, it is emergent and exciting gameplay that half the specs in the game are useless.
---
C'mon man. I love Classic and can't wait, but it could be an even better game if half the specs in the game weren't useless at end-game, with a handful of them being bad at both PvP and PvE.
---
Most people say the biggest flaw of Vanilla was Class Balance. Shame on me for wishing that more classes were relevant at end game.
---
(This is coming from someone who plays Mage/Warrior/Dwarf Priest too.. So it's not like I'm the one suffering.)
---
Please do, I come here for classic discussion, not asmon/mccuck clickbait. If those posts end up staying, please add the tag "buzzfeed" to them.
---
Not everyone will be the absolute most skilled players..you need to learn the difference between viable and optimal. Is it pvp optimal, no is it pvp viable, yes.
---
Will you be able to beat everyone? No
---
Will you be able to beat most of players? If you got the right skills, yes.
---
Well thanks for all the downvotes on my sincere question! At least I know now.
---
On par with (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19323/the-unstoppable-force)[Unstoppable Force] but way more fun.
---
The first time i encountered alliance was in this zone, 15 years ago.
---
I don¬¥t really get addicted to stuff. I have been drinking, taking Snus(Tobacco) and done some drugs(I don¬¥t recommend you do this) but i have never had a problem with quiting or keeping my life in check.
---
On the other hand if you are easily addicted its good to limit your game time and be really strict about not exceeding this time limit you set.
---
Even though I don¬¥t get easily addicted I still made a strict schedule that i can only follow if i make sure that i have everything else in life taken care of before.
---
I will play 16 Hours everyday for 14 days when the game launches. Now this may sound like a lot and it is but i have made arrangements to make sure it does not impact my life. The remaining 8 hours will be used for workout(1-2 hours depending on the routine) and sleeping. This will give me 224 or 9,3 days to reach level 60 which will mean i don¬¥t have to rush it and can work on professions and run some of the less rewarding dungeons while leveling(also known as having fun).
---
I¬¥m going to do all other things i need to do first and cook all my food for 14 days and freeze it(Healthy food, I recommend counting your calories to make sure you don¬¥t over or under eat) also keep a water bottle at your desk and make sure to drink at least 3 liters a day. I have also made sure my family/friends/work are aware that i¬¥m going to do this and that they are free to come visit if they want but that we will not be able to arrange anything during this period. If there is an emergency i will of course have to deal with it because at the end of the day video games are not as important as real life
---
After this 14 day period i will severely reduce my game time to catch up on chores and family/friends etc. Most days i will probably only log on a bit at night to run a dungeon or farm a bit.
---
I will also be leveling a warrior, I have leveled one Warrior back in the day and one on a private server so this should not be incredibly hard but wish me luck anyways.
---
I hope to see most of you when wow Classic launches and wish you a pleasant trip to 60 while still keeping your real life in check!

**Recruitment**: We've started building our main raid roster and so far it looks like we only really lack paladins and maybe a few more hunters and druids. Nothing is set in stone though, which is why we're still recruiting all classes (except main tanks). We also accept Socials, Casuals and Non-raiders!

We do not enforce min-maxing and rushing but we do expect our future members to be experienced (or at least a little familiar) with classic wow (preferably no tourists).

5 min iirc
---
Don't know about threat since dot threat is so irrelevant no one ever bothered testing this, but dot damage has snapshotting: if you use a spell damage buff and cast a dot, the dot damage will stay the same even if the buff runs out halfway through it.
---
Same. I have mained a healer since forever. Going paladin this time.
---
If you find out, let me know
---
I do intend to keep my cooking &amp; fishing up to par though this time. I never did that in vanilla, which resulted in having to level cooking and fishing from 1 to 300 at lvl 60 and that's a complete and utter bore. 
---
Since I will be playing 8-10h a day during the first weeks, leveling profs will be a change of pace.
---
As someone who played on American Internet back in Vanilla on the east coast US this is what I dealt with on bad ping days
---
The foundation of fighting rogues as a mage was getting a feel for the current latency to know just the right distance to use frost nova.
---
In TBC when people started to blast out Arena movies it was shocking to see what low latency people on the west coast got to experience.  To me it was like they were playing on easy mode.
---
Not really.  People wiped all the time in classic in dungeons.  That was because:  tanks tried to tank without using a shield or any tank talents; people tried to skip pulls and would inevitably mess up and pull 2 packs at once; people would go into dungeons at the very earliest level they could, making them succeptible to crushing blows from bosses; people ran around with pretty weak gear while leveling normally.  
---
Mobs might do less damage.  There was the guy who went and beast lored a bunch of mobs on pservers and beta and found that on average the beasts in beta did more damage.
---
Don't get me wrong, i love playing world of warcraft, but the lore's just rip-off of warhammer.
---
Even bigger PSA to warlock moves:
---
In a dungeon, use your soul stone on someone with a resurrection and NOT yourself! Even on a Shaman with their reincarnate. Mobs respawn in vanilla dungeons and the corpse runs usually add at least 10 minutes to your dungeon.
---
To be clear though, you can get out of Shadowform in order to heal, if you really want/need to.
---
nah there was both a login que and a server que at the stress test
---
I mean, when people start hitting roadblocks, yes people will try to make changes. If you think people aren't going to start complaining, especially the other priests, you're sorely mistaken.
---
Level your alt by boosting it with your main/friends in dungeons. takes 2 days played if done correctly
---
I was scared as f** because so many warrior spells generated threath üòÇüòÇ
---
Interesting. Maybe he isnt specific and he is talking about pvp or something
---
It‚Äôs viable as in you CAN clear content with it, but it ooms fast. It doesn‚Äôt really offer much to a raid group unless you‚Äôre stacked with a lot of warlocks. If you‚Äôre not healing on a priest you‚Äôre holding your group back but for casual groups it won‚Äôt matter and everyone will have fun. In PvP you‚Äôll be awesome, though.
---
You can just farm the gold it isnt hard
---
So does this mean that Big Iron Fishing Pole with like Crusader or something is BiS for 2H 29 twinks, too? Can I make a 29 enh shaman twink with a crusader fishing pole? 
---
*IS THIS OPTIMAL* oh my gosh
---
Using the word viable in a literal sense makes zero sense.
---
Literally anything is viable if you twist the meaning enough. Is it viable if I rank as a backpedalling unspecced naked rogue, sure! I can probably still kill bad lvl 48's and get SOME honor, thus it's viable!!!
---
I heard this is especially a problem for Horde Warlocks because of the lack of Salv.
---
I believed my /s detector was refined enough, but clearly reddit bottlenecks it. My bad, your clue was too subtle.
---
Exactly. I'm considering swapping factions to try out paladin, but honestly I'm not so sure I'm willing if this breaks holy-reck.
---
Let's hope someone with access to a level 30 on the beta could test it out for us.
---
I'll probably have to put Witcher on hold for WoW. It took me several months to get 250 hours in Breath of the Wild and everything I've looked up says one Witcher playthrough can easily hit that O.o
---
That wasn't a retcon as much as it fixed a major plothole.
---
Yes and you have to go to your beta page and select wow and classic wow
---
Caki walku desu
---
Oh look, another Rat-man post.
---
Right which is why I told him that he would fill a role as a dps shaman and he might need to also get a heal set to facilitate faster grouping and gearing. All things that I hinted to if didn‚Äôt out right mention. You acting like they are unplayable because of old stigmas is dumb. Not everyone is a min maxer world first raider. That mentality isn‚Äôt what classic is about, especially not now that all the content has been cleared over and over. People know all the tricks to get the most out of hybrids and they are viable. You just gotta be good
---
favorite memory is either the world pvp always being fun and unexpected as well as making twinks. twinks were lit AF
---
funniest part is the people as you will most likely start playing with the same people throughout
---
i played rogue and will definitely level up a rogue first. obviously i love pvp haha
---
i stopped playing WOW multiple years ago as it was never as fun as classic and the first 2 expansions. 
---
the game is actually hard to level up. NPC's that are higher levels will not die easily. some quest are hard and will need help. overall, it actually requires hard work to get what you want in the game. i can not wait
---
Not really grasping. If I don't see something I like I either down vote or reply. The fact that you felt the need to click my name to look at my posting history for some reason shows obsessive or upset you got.
---
Better for your game** there need to be gold sinks, and if you want to be a tryhard, you may have to actually try somewhat hard.
---
This is that fire content I needed today. Cheers man thanks!
---
&gt;I want to play druid with my friends, and they want to play horde.  
---
&gt;But I dont like taurens.
---
And how we can help You Sir?
---
Who‚Äôs Clinton?
---
There's a quest item that's an equippable trinket which kills your ass (500dmg/tick) and gives you a cool visual aura. It's great when you need to kill yourself without taking durability loss. Crystal of Z..something.
---
You can make 2 rogues ya know
---
nobody said they don't.
---
For pvp yes warlocks are definitely one of the better classes, specially once they get to the later gear tiers.
---
He just wants you to not play druid so he remains a special snowflake feral druid.
---
We had a lock top the charts in bwl.
---
I need more context here. Maybe he is referring to the fact that the beta is capped at 30, and warlocks are fairly strong then?
---
I'm not a follower of Soda, so I'm not sure if he's trolling, or what the specifics are here.
---
It actually does work. Esfand did the same thing, except he just immediately restored and logged back into it.
---
Did the entire zone in a few hours... nice.
---
So I have to multibox violating my personal integrity as well as costing me an extra subscription to play said alt?
---
Or the alternative is getting boosted, and then later boosting my friend. Well my main is going to be a rogue, that can't boost for shit, and even if I could, 2 days to 60 x2 is 4days to 60, that's not really much of a time saver considering how fast I can level with boosted gear.
---
I agree with this. I haven‚Äôt played since a bit in WotLK (mainly vanilla and TBC). I resubbed when I heard about classic and I logged in to my main who is level 80 and am just completely overwhelmed and don‚Äôt know what to do. So I just logged out and am now waiting for classic.
---
Cooking slows you down too.  There's no way you're getting enough meat from your quest kills to keep your cooking level current without sound some extra grinding, and a lot of recipes are sold by single vendors scattered over both continents, so if you don't have gold to burn buying them in the AH you're spending a lot of time running.
---
Choose whatever you want to choose for play.
---
My advice.
---
IE They didn't pay 60 dollars to become max level.
---
I‚Äôd rather play the game, I don‚Äôt see how farming gold for hours is more fun than playing with my guild in PVP or PVE. Just seems like a sincere waste of time. Why force yourself to do something in the game that isn‚Äôt fun? I‚Äôm just going to buy a couple thousand gold and play the auction house on BIS blue/epic boe gear to sustain consumables and respecs.
---
And buff scrolls! Loot and click that shit.
---
Your first time in vanilla? If you even get geared tank to low level dungeon...its your friend. I wouldn't tank random pug group ever...people running around with meme specs, clicking and keyboard turning complaining that healer &amp; tank suck while mobs are dying to old age with melee hunter smacking em with raptor strike...
---
Especially now with all the retail goobacks coming to instances wondering why tank can't hold while they spam aoe abilities.
---
It has always been $14.99. Even with inflation it‚Äôs still $14.99/month. When classic launches you will get both classic and retail for the same $14.99.
---
I think we will eventually get BC and WotLK servers. Which would be appreciated. I think BC was the best expansion in WoW history and I actually think it was better than vanilla. I didn't really like WotLK after reaching endgame, but I enjoyed the leveling process of it.
---
&gt; Again, he knows that any good guild will uses offtank to proc nightfal 
---
Seen many "good" guilds do exactly what he sugested, and from my experience mages competed with locks quite often for dps, we also have an increased debuff limit at the start so more dps from curroption from locks too.
---
The games in Beta right now for a reason guys.... calm down lol
---
Why? People are overreacting. This clips do no harm and some of them are interesting or hilarious.  
---
I agree that reposts or clickbaits, or real promotions of streamers should be deleted.
---
Play an orc or troll?
---
I did way back in classic
---
I ended up on mage for several reasons
---
1. soul shards could be kind of a pain to manage 
---
2. Food/Water, portals/teleport 
---
3. I really enjoyed how frost played out
---
Now there were things i like about locks, Fear and pets being the main ones
---
Found the horde player :p
---
https://youtu.be/k01xsCj_m20?t=3m42s
---
Neilyo auto-attacking from a long distance, just like what can be seen in classic beta and the TBC videos I linked above.
---
They are the best class in the game in late Vanilla, he's got that part right.
---
I get five extra vacation days in July for being with my company for 5 years. I decided to book off August 27-30th. When I went to book I truly realized how far away it is...
---
I think each streamer provides some good points/tips, but honestly a lot of them are copy/pasting things that are more or less general information. 
---
IMO, play the game yourself and try not to pay attention to streamers. Making mistakes in-game make you better and teach you about the game. 
---
Additionally, players in game (guildies and random people will meet) tend to provide some good info and answer questions. 
---
By all means, don‚Äôt stop watching streams if you like them, but as far as listening to their advise, take it with a pinch of salt.
---
Engineering is the best for both PvE and PvP. It's not necessary, but engineering adds some nice on demand AoE damage that you wouldn't have otherwise.
---
Eh. I don't want them to recreate bugs. We're already using updated talents, and gear. There's no reason to artificially slow or bug the game out for the feels.
---
You have to ask yourself, do I want to enjoy the game the way it was intended, or nolife poopsock my way to 60 as fast as possible so I can get bored or burned out faster?
---
I mean, this is getting a little super cereal for a facetious passing comment.
---
One reason would be you're not in range, or another that you want to instantly shift back and the time saving is worth it.
---
There's plenty of time sinks and you know what I'm using the respecs for right? Ranking.
---
The less gold I have to farm, the more I can pvp, the more everyone can pvp, and thus the more pvp I need to do. The only difference between 25 and 50g respec is that I spend 1 more hour per week pvping, instead of farming gold. That's it.
---
Yeah, exactly that.
---
Thousands of people I never see. I play on area 52 and I never see any of the big guild names around. When I sit in the horde capital out of the 50 people on my screen maybe three don‚Äôt have an asterisk by their name. That is a problem.
---
the problem isnt that it CAN be blazed through its that end game dungeons encourage it.... I was never a fan of timed end game events... Mythic+ encourages every corner be cut every cheese be used.  
---
I remember ESO had timed leaderboards at launch (not sure if they still do)  but I absolutely hated that gameplay... Now here we are a couple years later in WoW and thats all dungeons are, timed speed runs.   
---
still idk why blizz went the way of thinking faster speed= more difficulty
---
trash guild
---
Just gets a bit annoying when 3 posts on the Frontpage and more in the next are literally the same post being upvoted multiple times creating spam. Cool, the guy trained a mob to Stormwind. We don't need the same post multiple times all upvoted to top pages.
---
Not sure why community is so fascinated with the guy other than he scored a beta access. Hasn't done what has already been done countless times and is mediocre with annoying personality. *shrugs* I guess it's a samilar reason that millions of people watch pewdiepie.
---
Are you being intentionally dense?
---
If they want to get to 60 fast. If they want to enjoy more aspects of the game other than leveling fast and ignoring content, then cooking is a great avenue for that.
---
Arguably 20/0/31 ret spec is a good way to level aswell whit /sit not procing shildblock/reckoning. And if you are going prot at 40 you need a iron shildspike so you have to hope someone levels blacksmithing. Levelling whit someone I'd still go 13 point ret then holy for seal of command and run/ride speed
---
Agreed, so annoying. I liked the old version of dalies where they were for something extra -- like my beloved netherdrake. But today where you need to dailies to keep up with things like AP are just so annoying.

It was the head of a costume she was wearing. Dontworryaboutit
---
&gt;Seen many "good" guilds 
---
bad guilds
---
&gt; nd from my experience mages competed with locks
---
bad players
---
I can maybe work towards a tank alt that can eventually take over some of the lower raids (say one year into classic). Till then i'll try to stick to a DPS role. Its a compromise, but it will be something new to me at the same time.
---
He‚Äôs definitely the guy that did 9/11
---
Yea that really was amazing, thanks a bunch for the answer and tons of info!
---
Sounds like a swell idea, unfortunately not how it works.
---
Played my gnome rogue all the way to 70, definitely not a bad idea!
---
I would not hope.  They probably didn't invite any new people to this, since they have enough stress testers.
---
The spirit and stam are both great. That extra stam can sometimes mean the difference between being able to solo an encounter, and needing a group.
---
This is accurate, range has been this long since patch 1.3.0.
---
Most private servers have this fixed as well, just not auto-attacks during slows, which is wrong on private servers.
---
What was the plothole? I did the first mission with draenei in them in warcraft 3 a couple days ago. Was wondering why they weren't "normal"
---
Explore other classes. Or make a Tauren on a private server and see if you can look past it before the game launches.
---
I too prescribe to the skyrim strategy.
---
TBC's retcons were pretty huge. Draenei went from lost mutants to goodie Eredar with spaceships, a whole slew of weird changes to let the Blood Elves into the Horde, Illidian and Kael &amp; co were beaten with the stupid stick to make them raid bosses, etc.
---
Also, Vanilla actually had its own share of retcons. Night Elves for example changed massively compared to their WIII incarnation, becoming far more regular forest folk.
---
nah, he was talking about 60 with how you could get raid slots and such, including being a priest. I think pve/pvp
---
&gt; I decided that playing Mage and shitting all over Rogues 
---
Lol, have fun.
---
wont happen
---
&gt; Or maybe people are just fucking idiots
---
you've confirmed this plenty of times pal
---
There's the small matter of the words "up to" in there.
---
Right so you want me to spend about 200 hours leveling and gearing an additionally rogue so that I can rank on that rogue, without the benefits of raiding gear and without the gear being benefitical as it's not my raiding rogue, so that I can save on 1200-1500gold in respecs?
---
He yelled into the void. And there was silence.
---
When the old game kills the new game they will have to do something.  Corporate overloads gonna see the amount of people logging into one versus the other, and what game producers and designers have said about the subject up to that exact point will mean fuck all.
---
I'll complain with the locks then saying I want my 15+% dps per lock.
---
There's no telling if the xp issued on that private server will be the same as the xp in classic
---
&gt; Is it possible to mind control the flag carrier in wsg and then have a pally cast blessing of protection on him, making him lose the flag?  
---
Yes, and a note to all horde players, if you use gnomish mc cap on a paladin, chances are that they will randomly BoP you as well. So try to avoid that when you carry the flag in wsg :p
---
Shit as in "the shit"
---
Welp, that‚Äôs it boys. Shut down the classic server, it‚Äôs not needed.
---
You never played vanilla, you wouldn‚Äôt know.
---
Dat whirlwind axe!
---
That thing was so frigging awesome if you got it right away.
---
My mean looking warrior running around in the tiny spike cloth shoulders...
---
Crushing blows are +50% more damage. Crits are +100% more damage. 
---
Druids that gear properly have a LOT more armor than a Prot Warrior. So whereas a warrior might take consistant hits for 1000 damage, a Druid wouldnt get hit for 1000/1500/2000 if crit or crushed, because they'd mitigate it lower - they might take 800/1200/1600 instead (with the 1600 being rare) and would have a similar if not HIGHER pool of health.
---
Yes, the druid would take more damage overall but it's not quite as bad as you may think. Plus with the meta shifting to Warriors dropping their shields and running dual wield fury tank purely to generate enough threat, the argument that Druids are too squishy completely goes out of the window as a Bear will still take a lot less damage than a dual wielding warrior.
---
I mean you do have to multibox as in having 2 characters online at the same time. But anyway you are saying I should pay 15x20(ish months idk how long classic will last) dollars so I can save 50 hours of gameplay of leveling an alt fairly?
---
It depends on your class if that's good or not, at least in my experience. That said I wouldn't worry about rushing just do what you like. Unlike current it isn't just about getting to max level because even lower level dungeons are important due to them droping resist gear. Heck I think even a friend of mind farmed gnomer hoping for a specific ring to drop off the last boss because it had dozens of types for of the blank
---
I led pugs all the time on nostalrius for Mc &amp; bwl. There will be pugs. Aq40 and naxx are 100% not pugable and that‚Äôs ok.
---
I don't hate anything you have said.
---
Strider meat is only as rare as you make it. With as much running as you do between level 12 and 20 in the Barrens, just wreck every plainstrider you come across, and you'll have plenty. This is also good for mages and priests to collect Light Feathers so you don't have to grind so many later.
---
I also forgot to add Hot Lion Chops and Bear Steak from Hillsbrad. Cooking is easy if you make it a secondary priority to grind mats as you move.
---
Just bugs, and they are using layering to combat the sheer numbers of players in the starting zones. Which they said they are turning off later on
---
Whatever pace you‚Äôre comfortable with, I got level 1-36 in 16 hours /played but I‚Äôm not leveling professions at all and I know the zone quests by heart. I also didn‚Äôt bother attempting to do dungeons and spend the entire time grinding through quests.
---
If only my normal days off were Wednesday and Friday.
---
Oh wait, those are my days off...
---
EXCELLENT.
---
tbh, i only put a little bit of time into the first stress test (outside of trying endlessly to login during the actual stress test part - i wanted to help test the login servers.). Level 5 is too limited. But level 10 - get your hunter pets, your fire totem, your voidwalker, Bear form - all kinds of good shit happens at 10. Definitely gonna run through a few characters this time.
---
You think you do but you don't.
---
can you elaborate? Am lore noob and it sounds interesting. I read the book about the war between Draenei and Orcs on Draenor
---
Take a look at [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS_P3OaKUY).
---
That's a ridiculous thing to extrapolate from this.
---
Yes by confronting idiots like you.
---
Dude.
---
I was never actually BM, it just defaulted to that since I haven‚Äôt chosen a spec since Vanilla.  üòá
---
If a dreamer yells and no one was there to hear it did the dreamer really yell?
---
&gt;I‚Äôd rather play the game
---
Farming is a huge part of vanilla wow it IS playing the game.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt see how farming gold for hours is more fun than playing with my guild in PVP or PVE. Just seems like a sincere waste of time
---
Well if your farming when you friends are doing fun shit then you have terrible time managment skills, you farm when you have downtime
---
I don't like people bugging me for stuff so since mages get asked for portals and water all the time I would go warlock.
---
Because classic is about you having fun, modern wow is about grinds.
---
I am driving 12 hours tomorrow :T at least I'll have the evening and the following day!
---
To be honest , going off all the polls that have been done about who will play what class on different sites, warlock and mage seems a lot closer now than they were in vanilla. It might be due to the game already starting on a patch where locks are good, as opposed to vanilla where no one were sure what was going to happen to the class in the beginning.
---
Right?  I remember my vanilla days, with my rogue I had to pop every cooldown (including blind+first aid) plus the biggest potion available for my level to have a decent shot at soloing many elites.  If there was a second mob, forget about it unless I could sap the elite, kill his buddy, run out of aggro, and return.
---
The quote doesn't say you have to play 20 hours a day for a year to qualify. It just cites it as one example. Seriously, you need to read things better if you're going to comment on them.
---
Nostalrius was about 3-4x the size of an average Blizzard server though.
---
Just for curiosities sake, how did you guys ensure that loot would be distributed fairly in a PUG? There were guilds I struggled to trust in Vanilla, let alone a PUG. In Tier 2 it could be pretty tempting for a Pug RL to hold the raid hostage and priority loot for himself.
---
Does shammy will be 2handers ? i miss those WF crit
---
This guy says there wont really be PUGs for 40man raids
---
Except what's positive is highly subjective. I'd argue they had to make PvP boring because of arenas. There were so many trinkets and consumables you could use in classic and they all got nerfed. And deaths happened quickly. Now it takes minutes for anyone to die in a 3v3 scenario because they can't have their eSports matches end in less than 10 seconds of interactions from a lucky windfurry crit.
---
I personally never want to see arenas in classic.
---
The only thing I remember them saying was that everyone who was invited to the last one would be invited to this one.
---
If you watch the interviews you can clearly see that they know what playerbase they are making classic for.
---
I know that being endlessly jaded is the new cool kid shtick but some people like looking at silver linings.
---
I remember the day spec started mattering and it started to kill guilds, vividly, the day one of our rogues brought the addon DamageMeters to Molten Core.
---
RIP.
---
&gt;Sometimes I think about rolling Hunter and shitting all over melee *and* casters....
---
I thought about maining both mage and lock but hunter is the real answer. It doesn't even bother me that they're dps is kinda bad in pve, I just can't wait to kite the shit out of people and oom all the healers from the backline with vipersting.
---
25hours is pretttttty slow, esp for a private server I think      
---
But also judging pace off private server wouldn't work out well for live, unless you're slow in the first place in which case it'll be even more obvious
---
When will you release the results? I am very interested to see what kinds of patterns can be drawn
---
1. Warrior is one of the hardest classes to level
---
2. Druids are not very popular to play, because at end game your only option is Resto and people prefer a healer with a real rez, so people would rather play Warrior or Priest/Shaman/Paladin
---
3. Paladins could not tank very well in Vanilla (no taunt, bad prot tree) and there were no other tank classes
---
So basically the only 2 classes are under-represented.  And even then, the Warrior is probably Fury to level.
---
I asked why you put the confirmed in quotation marks. Because to me that implies you dont believe them, which seems dumb.
---
A dragon kited to stormwind is not really cool though, that wouldn't break the front page at any other point in wow history.
---
No but it is probably better than having the people in charge of retail do it.
---
1. Why is there so little love for hunters? They don't do anything particularly well in PvE aside from Tranq shots, the damage is relatively low by comparison, and items they want are typically better suited going to other classes, hence the "hunter weapon" memes. 
---
2. I know it's extremely fun to play class but how are they in PVP?  
---
Hunters are very strong in PvP, there is a bit of a skill floor just due to how fragile they "can" be in melee, and the inability to use traps in combat, learning how to kite and keep people ranged, while also being prepared for an engage with tricks like FD -&gt; trap, or taking counter strike become pretty important, however in most BGs, you can basically stand back and line up aimshots and multi shots and melt faces off with ease.
---
Nice. I work five tens. Salary sucks sometimes.
---
I feel like they could expand the levelvs, but at a MUCH slower progression, like only increasing by 5 levels per expansion, and not increasing the the stats to ridculous levels. So even in say 5 expansions from now, the gear from the past content could still be relevent to a degtee. I always thought that it was so stupid that my level 120 or whatever priest could just walk through and kick everything that was not in the latest or previous content down without any struggle at all. Literally just meleeing a raid boss with my staff until it died always kinda churned my stomach and made them feel... worthless.
---
Skip:
---
Higher than rank2 poly
---
Fireball if you are leveling frost, frostbolt(except r1) if you are leveling fire.
---
Frost/fire wards optionally. Can be useful, most likely won't be.
---
Detect magic
---
Flamestrike
---
Amplify magic
---
And yes arcane missiles.
---
Exploration XP has a cap based on your level. So as a level 58, you could get, say 400xp, for exploring winterspring. But at level 10, you're capped at like 110.

Some estimates for # of explorable subzones, there's not a lot of data. But, exploring every zone in the game should reasonably get you to level 10.

This is a world with years and years of content, nevertheless, it just keep being restricted to the last expansion, marking completely irrelevant to re use all the effort they have already done.

Top kek
---
You can
---
We did a +1 system I had pen and paper to track rank. Any one who got a piece of gear from winning a /roll got a +1. When an item dropped only +0 could roll. If no +0 needed then +1 could roll and then +2 and so on.
---
200h to lvl a toon after you already know the route/character? ok..
---
And if you don't want to put in that work either looks like you might have to farm a bit.
---
My entire guild bought gold in vanilla...
---
And no, I just have a career and wife/kids to take care of and don‚Äôt want to waste my time.
---
I definitely feel like it's 2007 again, crazy nostalgia
---
RemindMe! 90 days
---
Pure pugs.
---
Sure, you might have 28-30 people and need to PUG 10-12 more. But I'm talking like a retail style PUG for a heroic raid or Mythic raid. That won't really happen past Molten Core where it's just 40 complete randos.
---
yeah I miss typed
---
I always thought it was from auto and motorcycle racing. The classes determine what type of cars are allowed to compete for a given race.
---
Most hybrids are kinda viable, enhancement really is not, the only spec wors in endgame pve is prot paladins. And I'm not talking about the top 1% of guilds rushing content i am talking about top 50% guilds that will have a chance to clear content past bwl. The top 1% can easily bring a couple of ofspecs to every raid the bottom of the top 50% might not be that lucky
---
Start reading blue posts or jstfu. It's clearly a bug, they're working on. And just you saying sharding and layering are "kind of the same thing" doesn't make it true.
---
Stay calm. Blizz knows about the issues, that's why they test it.

Knaak is tough. Try something like Lord of the Clans by Christie Golden instead.
---
If it is, I would be happy to forward it to my friend who is currently working on Classic addons for August 27th!
---
Because some of us don't need to see multiple posts across top pages on the same video of his. Plus, if you enjoyed and like his videos there is a good chance you already subscribed to him and would know when he uploaded a video or be obsessed enough to check his account frequently. Some people don't like him because is nothing special. He hasn't done anything that hasn't been done before, has an annoying personality, and isn't an amazing people and have his friends &amp; followers help or carry him.
---
And don't know how much positivity supporting streamers that interrupt gameplay or get people killed. You like him? Fine. Maybe have a post every now and then on important content matter he does, but the community doesn't need to be flooded with posts every time the guy decides to stream.
---
You watch sodapopin lol and you think your the end all knowegable one about classic wow.... how dense lol
---
You intentionally left out the part where I said leveling AND GEARING
---
What, you want me to pvp naked? Without epic mount?
---
Oh I know almost all vanilla dungeons by heart. But I guess I just remember it being harder and we were probably worst players then.
---
yeah top deaths üòÇ
---
I don't understand why they changed Stranglethorn Vale.
---
That was my absolute favorite area to level up. The quests, the different elites like King Bangalash, the random pvp moments. It was so much fun!
---
Like I said, that's why SW/PI is a spec. It's better to have a sub-par healer than an OOM below the tank DPS. But if that's "shadow spec" enough for you, then by all means, it's viable as a one-of in raids.
---
Anything with a on-use OR proc you should generally consider a web-search for before you sell, e.g. Mark of the chosen. Similar with anything that seems to have a unique effect for that item slot. 
---
Anything that is a consumable, you can generally sell or use right away. Yes, there are some insane quest consumables, but you will never use them because you don't know when you should (Moist towelette, slumber sand, Light of Elune). They end up being in your bank forever, wasting away...
---
Then there are some items with uses one does not immediately see: Dancing Silver with 29 spirit is a good 'evocation staff' before a drop from ZG. Wand of biting cold is decent for cold damage instances (For an AQ40 boss). There are also some nature/frost/fire resistance pieces. Finally, pets or items with unique RP looks might be worth keeping, if that is your fancy.

Not at all, they're just an alternative. The thing with Bears is their talent tree sucked until later in Vanilla but we're running 1.12 and that's when bears were at their peak.
---
Bears generate a LOT more threat than a "typical" prot warrior because bear threat is a 3x multiplier on Maul whereas warrior threat moves generally are fixed amounts. And as vanilla advanced, people realised you wanted your tank to generate lots of threat, and it wasnt all just about having the beefiest hardiest MT around.
---
I was a Bear tank in vanilla, around the time of AQ. I tanked our guild's first Ragnaros kill (on resistance fights Druids are arguable better tanks) and tanked here and there in BWL/AQ as an offtank, but would always main tank the group's 20 man runs. Bear's main issue is the gear for them is a bit lacking in certain instances. In pre-raid BIS blues from Dire Maul/Strat/UBRS etc you can main tank all of Molten Core and a bit of BWL with zero issues. There's almost no upgrades in MC though so by the time BWL comes around Warriors are the better choice as they're all in Might and you're still in Blues. even by the end of BWL all you have is your pre-raid Blues, maybe an item or two from ZG and the bear tank chest from BWL, and Warriors are in full Wrath so are miles better... then AQ comes around and you get access to the Genesis set and lots of high armor epics and bears are suddenly insane. Naxx has a few items but a full AQ geared bear will be plenty for a threat option there.
---
If anything Druid tanking is easier than warrior tanking as it has less buttons to manage and it generates more threat, you just need to GEAR right. Too many druid tanks dont understand how the class works mechanically so don't get enough bonus armor or use too much rogue gear, or undervalue certain items.
---
I expect we'll see a lot of druid tanks in vanilla and they'll be really strong. The community knows how to use them now.
---
I chose battlenet

Already got it

The inability for people to suggest changes to classic because it's annoying.

Transmog pretty much collapsed the empire,

What no? They are the same thing. Why are ppl acting like they arent just because blizz is saying they arent. Feel like we need that spongebob meme here, the one where they try to explain to patrick that 2 things are fundamentally the same.

As someone who pugged raids until TBC, I have to disagree.
---
Valid if you never die. Otherwise OCD
---
Two brothers, longtime raiders looking for a guild. Off and on players depending on the expansion looking for a guild to level and raid with at 60. A perfect scenario would be a PVP server with balanced factions but a guild focused on PVP. Would also be ok with a normal server. PM me.

* NA

* Normal or PVP

* EST - Looking for raid times in the range of 7PM-11:30 PM EST

The good old days of shitty cloaks hah

The point is this:

With no layering they have 2 choices: 
---
A) Make a ton of servers to meet the demand of launch day so everything isn't overcrowded as balls, then almost all of them die in a few months as the hype dies.
---
B) Make not so many servers and they will be insanely overcrowded shitfests until the hype dies in a few months then they go down to a normal population and servers don't die.
---
With layering, they get the best of both worlds. They can make a few amount of servers and fix the overcrowding issue with layering, then once the hype dies and most people quit, they can remove the layering and be left with well populated servers

Oh sorry didn‚Äôt see the ‚Äúand gearing‚Äù
---
But yeah I managed to pay for it last time around and I thought it was easy, this time I have less time to spend on farming so I‚Äôm making 2 problem solved for me, I find getting gear fun soo that‚Äôs a bonus.
---
Screw it. I'm game for a phase 0.5 upon release with a level cap of 30. It's looking hella fun.
---
&gt; **there won't really be PUGs for raids** 
---
Okay
---
As a warrior solo lvling on a vanilla private server, I picked up alchemy just for that. And let me tell you: i fucking live on minor and discolored health potions. I drink so much of that shit, my undead pee must be weird as fuck. Those tiny buffs and healing shots are indeed important, especialy for classes that are harder to lvl.
---
Most beta invites for non influencers I‚Äôve seen is day 1‚Äôers / release players. I got my invite and played at release as well.
---
Thanks! Lookin' forward to using this.

Different armor types for cloaks and bucklers for rogues were in the original beta.  I remember when they got removed.  So yeah, almost made it to live.

---
Is this true though? My understanding is that much of the benefit of fury is due to enrage - which behaves differently than private servers.
---
I prefer putting in actual game hours instead of buying my way to everything in games, but you do you.

always put yourself first, man

you seem to hate everything about going tauren, but love everything about going night elf

go night elf then, you'll make new friends

I think the biggest issue with BFA and all modern MMOs is that they forcefeed you their content.
---
What happens when you login to BFA or pretty much any korean MMO? You get lots of daily chores thrown into your face:
---
"Hey, if you run a random dungeon once, you will get this awesome lootbox!"
---
"What about doing a warfront today? You will get extra loot if you do it today!"
---
"Well, I know you already got that item, but you didn't get the right titanforged version yet, maybe you should run that dungeon *again*?"
---
"Did you do your world quests today? Extra loot inc!"
---
"Did you do PvP today? Well, duh, you queue right now!"
---
Korean MMOs are even more ridicolous on that front. They just outright give you a reward just for logging in or staying online for x hours. You don't even have to do a damn thing.
---
I HATE it when games do that. Classic WoW on the other hand allows me to play at my own pace. I can decide to do a marathon session on one day and then don't log on for a week if I want to and not even have a big disadvantage when doing that. I can decide to never run a certain dungeon again after I got my loot. I can decide to entirely skip PvP if I don't want to participate in it - or I can decide to do all quests or whatever.
---
There are no achievements, no daily chores, no rewards for certain goals. The goal itself is the reward. And that feels amazing. It allows me to decide what I want to do with my time instead of putting me on themepark rails. I can log in right now and do nothing but fishing. There is no shiny popup telling me to join a fucking warfront or island expedition. There is nothing forcing me to stay logged in until I finish all of my daily chores. In fact, classic even encourages you to stay logged off for longer periods of time if you just cant make up the time to play by giving you rested experience. When was the last time a modern MMO actually encouraged you to log off for more than a day?

Oh man. I remember when that game came out I wanted to play it so badly, but my computer was a piece of crap and couldn't run it... never did play it
---
Better Sylvanas model
---
Lord of the Clans if you want more Thrall, Last Guardian if you want to know more about Medivh, Tides of Darkness and Beyond the dark portal are the Wc2 story.
---
The books are sorted by release om the Wiki. If you keep to the Classic/TBC books, you'll get some nice reading. Really, just pick the one you find interesting. But be warned, Knaak is a tough read.
---
This is why I've only the required dungeons for the achievement to get flying when it's released.  I do older content leveling other toons &amp; will finish leveling 110-120 chars after I get flying.  Right now leveling them is just boring. I'm having more fun working on Loremaster in the "Forgotten Lands".
---
thunderclap is more than enough to keep the healers from getting slapped in the face if the other dps attacks your target.
---
High rank poly is very useful. The increased duration is very noticeable.
---
Lots and lots of great memories! Priests killing annoying people during Neferion is a classic
---
I think dual-specc would be a great choice. Transmog would be nice too, but the limitation of items in classic makes it a little nonsens.
---
It's my birthday tomorrow and this would be a killer surprise. I ain't been subbed in a long time though so wouldn't be surprised by no invite.
---
 I will definitely have an alt or two, but another rogue is pointless.
---
You should in fact keep both a DPS and Tank set as current as possible.  You can occasionally get groups as a fury warrior, but it‚Äôs infinitely harder than getting group as a tank.  Also, most tanks while leveling are actually fury warriors, so a lot of them won‚Äôt want to invite you as they‚Äôll also want fury gear.  As for duo leveling partners... pretty much anything.  Classes with healths are nice.
---
And absolutely everything owns you in PvP if you‚Äôre solo.  If you have a pocket healer and great gear end game, then you can smash people hard with a warrior tho.  Honestly, their absolute shit tier level in solo world PvP while leveling is the only thing keeping me from 100% going warrior at launch.  I want to take my time leveling a bit this time around and really engage in world PvP while leveling.  Warrior is the absolute worst class for this.
---
Blizzard needs to lock down layers making it excessively difficult to hop layers. Blizzard also needs to never say a word on the intricacies of how it works.
---
That‚Äôs just arming players. 
---
Blizzards best bet, is to apply all the changes to layering they can to make it hard to swap layers then stay quiet. As the community figures out how it works and loopholes are found. Blizzard needs to be proactive in finding a solution to stop that behavior.
---
The big problem I see, even in a world with no layer abuse is what happens in 3 months if servers when adding all layers are still at 3,4,6,7x pop cap. How do you maintain your promise, progress content, and not degrade the experience by putting way too many people on one shard?
---
Well shit I just paid and downloaded it for my chrome book.
---
You never go to the bathroom? You wont have any chores that you need to do?
---
Because I know I will, and that is the perfect time to level professions.
---
It's less than 15 years of content because most of Vanilla was wiped in Cata.
---
Increased inspect range. No reason for it to not exist.
---
why on earth would they need to port retail to mobile? Have you ever played high end raiding or M+? You would never be able to play retail on mobile
---
Arenas
---
Or mythic + but without better gear drops
---
I had a friend who was forced to take an aq trinket if he wanted to raid because it reduced agro. I forget if it was a use or natural but was told if he isn't wearing that trinket because of how easy he pulled agro off the tank he wasn't allowed in the raid.
---
Aren't you overreacting a bit? A few clips a day of memorable events from the beta amongst all the other threads in the sub is hardly worth comparing it to livestreamfails. If all the threads were of the same clip or all from the same stream I could relate but that's just not the case.
---
Besides, you've already solved your personal problem with the clips by flitering asmon and esfand.
---
Nice, thanks for the info. Maybe I'll go tank instead then (planning on playing druid, and originally the idea was to tank during lvling and then healing raids)
---
Really depends on what you mean by adding new content, while new dungeons and such would be fun they would also probably need to at least add some of the class changes from tbc and beyond that made unviable specs viable, like really viable that you don't need to just be in a super casual friendly guild to be allowed to raid as that spec.
---
Honestly, I think classic would have to be way more than sorta successful to justify making new content, it would have to blow retail out of the water. If it does have some success it is easier to see them being able to justify making a tbc classic. Honestly I could see them making classic servers up to WoD even since wod to legion was the hugest change in skill pruning and all that junk with the artifact weapons.
---
For my two cents though? I think itd be easier to reintroduce some of the flavor/design of classic into retail than making entirely new classic content. Hell, I would honestly be satisfied if they just made specs played like their MoP/WoD versions honestly, really miss playing combat rogue.
---
I think the idea that there will always be super dangerous zones is pretty cool. IE if the level cap is 30 or 40, you will never be safe in EPL, which would make that zone rightfully terrifying in the same way it is in lore.
---
I had this experience in vanilla and it was a ton of fun.
---
I rerolled on a new server the vanilla patch they started to introduce battlegrounds to the game.  Farming battlegrounds was the best way to get honor and I was focused on leading the boards in honor each week for the pvp rank grind.    However, due to the low population of the new server, there was not enough pvp population at high brackets to fill battlegrounds.  I found I could get far more honor staying at 30 and running battlegrounds all day.  I ended up forming a coalition cross-faction on the server of like-minded pvpers.  We all agreed to stop at a certain bracket to pvp.  Once we noticed the population curve would catch up, we'd agree to all unlock our XP and move up together to the next bracket before locking it again.  I ended up reaching Legionnaire rank before I hit level 60.
---
It was really fun to experience the shift in meta between an Arathi Basin at 30 and one at 40 with mounts.  You could focus on gearing out your character too because you knew the advantage would be worth it for the period of time you were sitting at that bracket.
---
Yeah not being able to change my hair style EVER is the only part of classic wow I'm not happy about
---
flying mounts definitely weren't strictly an improvement
---
Depends what you are doing really, I think 30seconds is fine, but yes it can be useful, but it is also expensive. The point is to get mount fast, after that you should of course learn higher ranks. You are just skipping rank 3 at 40 until you have mount.
---
I mean, our opinions of cool are of course objective but if that isn't cool enough for you to want to see then you have a very high bar for entertainment.
---
That's freaking amazing. Damn AV used to be so damn good. Such a stupid decision to remove what made it great.
---
Yeah, areas are marked as their own level, and as a lower level, you're capped at +5 zone. So if you're level 7, any zone higher than 12 will give the same xp as a level 12 zone.
---
Layering would totally be required for a smooth experience early game. Ever played on a popular private server? Getting anything done will take 100 times longer with all the people trying to do the same thing at once. 
---
It's also a physical hardware limitation. Blizz use Amazon's AWS cloud infrastructure, and each instance can only handle so much load, they would put a cap on the load for each layer (instance of a server spinning) and when it's nearing max capacity, start spinning up a new one and start dropping new connections into that instead before the other one reaches max so that it starts getting populated. This prevents physical and virtual server crashes. It's a common tech used nowadays for CDN's. Without it it would be an abysbal experience for just about everyone. 
---
Classic isn't going to be a pure vanilla experience, and never will be. But that's okay. Infact I hope eventually we get the OSRS mantra and start getting balance changes, and new content with the vanilla experience at heart.
---
Or any RPG
---
\*On the final LAVOS core

"I might need these Mega-elixers in NG+"
---
Yep, I ain't got much time to play anyway, so that's what i'll do. Welfare boys on the other hand..
---
I leveled up for the first time in Wrath and leveling was not terribly different from what it is like now on retail. Main reason for that was that there was simply no one around to do dungeons, raids, or even group with for quests. The world was absolutely empty (except for main hubs) until I hit northrend.  I have no idea how to fix the issue for all sides but the "current" leveling problem has been going on a lot longer than most people realize. Its a tough one.
---
INFP rogue
---
Ignore Blizzard ... good one :P
---
I think it‚Äôs fair to say a good chunk of it
---
is nostalgia, but it‚Äôs also a completely different game than modern WoW. It stands to reason that many people simply prefer that type of game.
---
Also who decided nostalgia was somehow an invalid form of enjoyment?
---
This has already been confirmed to be a bug unrelated to layering. Been happening all around
---
I got bad news for you fam.
---
Sure it possible, but doesn‚Äôt that destroy commmunities?
---
It happened on live. I was on Arthas, all of our hardcore guilds left during naxx progression for MalGanis. Malganis had a new server blade and less lag so they all went.
---
Arthas changed entirely as a server. 2004/05 Arthas of Ioneye, Maydie, Mute, Pat was not the one of late 2006 we went into Bc with.
---
I know very little about Google Sheets, but is it possible to add drop-down boxes like in excel?
---
See you in STV ü§∫üí´üí•ü§∫
---
&gt; In previous beta access I got to play with players like Venruki and Pikaboo daily. On live this would never happen, but a lot of us were in the same guild on beta because it didn't matter
---
That is how I summarized it, that seems like it's exactly what you wrote.
---
When the game is live it will have ranked content progression, which is all that is needed for big time cliques and exclusive guilds.  In that respect it won't be like Vanilla where guilds existed for the experience and their intent to progress remained an open question for some matter of months.
---
Make a discount, one adopted one offered :D
---
Oooh. The patch is just a patch. You need to have an original FFT disc for ps1 and then rip the disc to make an ISO. Then you apply the patch to the ISO. (if you can find an ISO of the game elsewhere, you can probably do that too).
---
Don't feel bad, I've purchased at least four versions of FFT over the years. War of the Lions is fucking fantastic.
---
I  saw both happen on Suramar.  My guild also brought Hakkar plague to Ironforge.  Before the PVP system went in, there were huge fights daily in Hillsbrad and we were a PVE server.
---
Streamers are not necessary to make the game "feel alive"
---
Yeah so like 1/2 of the raid was guildies just running for bindings the other half were pugs.  It worked well.
---
retail is massively more difficult than classic in terms of skill required from the player
---
Thank you.   
---
-every solo warrior
---
Not the case Spriests have their debuff limit opened up to them so they can manage better than most hunters I saw at that point in classic tbf. 
---
And then if you have 5 locks in the group then you only need to do less than 25% of their average dmg to be on par with the locks. Say the Spriest only manages 50% of the average lock dps, thats like brining 40.25 people to the raid not 40. With each lock the dps output of the individual spriest matters less and less.
---
Every class has fewer spells on classic than TBC and LK.
---
Also might be too late but I'm wondering if not only the class but the role is tied to personality.....i.e. healing, tank, melee, or ranged dps
---
I'd really take everything that goes on in the stress test with a grain of salt. Being as its not a live experience the sharding behaviour could be due to any number of things. It could be manual so devs can see in real time what happens with layers or they could be cranking player cap settings or significantly decreasing them to see what happens to server load/stability. It is extremely likely in this point of the beta/stress tests this tech is not behaving at all as they intend it to in a live server.
---
Cool, another question - are there any penalties for exploring lower level areas? E.g. if I'm level 40 and I go and explore Mulgore, will I get reduced exerience compared to exploring it at level 5?
---
lmao this reply chain is sick
---
Aye. So much hate everywhere I kinda kneejerk at everything nowdays.
---
How? Are they adding an XP lock? That wasn't added until long after Vanilla.
---
We had an enchancement shaman in our guild in vanilla and he was not the worst dps in raid ever. Middle of the road most fights. We cleared aq40. If everyone is equal skilled and equal gear yes, depending on procs enhance would be near the bottom if not the bottom. But it Would still be acceptable dps to clear everything. Player skill means a lot in vanilla. You can‚Äôt have 5 enhancement shamans in a raid but a good enchantment shaman can raid just fine and he will excel at pvp, farming, questing, dungeons etc. you know the 95 percent makeup of the rest of the game.
---
If you're not AoE grinding, when will you realistically be using it?
---
I‚Äôm excited to curl up tonight with some FFT. It‚Äôs going to be fucking great.
---
Warlock vs Mage ... ultimate decision = Hunter :P
---
Nope, because as a low lvl warrior, im always struggling. So i kinda live and die on my potions.
---
If you need to bind all of those useless skills it's a You problem.
---
I‚Äôm not arguing that it was hard back then, difficulty is relative hence why many people have been remembering it differently. Either way, the average player in Classic is going to be a lot better than the average player in Vanilla. Making up statistics here, but if the average Vanilla Deadmines group wiped 2 times, the average Classic Deadmines group might wipe, say, 0.5 times, making the experience a bit less satisfying (cue Asmon ranting about Vanilla being too easy during the run). The feeling of accomplishment in Vanilla definitely stems from more than just wiping/experiencing failure, but I really think Vanilla was the sweet spot in that aspect, and I think Classic should incorporate lessons learned from the private server scene.
---
just anecdotally I have a ton of friends who are hardcore retail players and have absolutely no interest in playing vanilla wow, it goes both ways
---
Lmao I havent been to a bar or club in years but I will certainly keep this in mind
---
On my priest I remember doing /tar and then mind visioning the efc to tell people where to go in vanilla.
---
What blue post?
---
Lol, you &amp; I are playing an mmorpg. Also, your hobby consists of hanging unto every word a streamer from an old game says, and white knights him on the forums. So you telling someone else to get a new hobby is laudable.
---
summon a mage table and have warlocks make a summoning portal and health stone table.
---
I'm just wondering why you didn't wait to pop it until the beginning of your next raid what a waste of a buff...
---
Reason is a lot of people go in thinking ‚Äúima tank‚Äù and the warrior ends up being REALLY painful to level compared to other classes, tanking means leading a run, knowing how to pull, marking targets, taking shit from people when you mess up, and then finding out every guild just needs 1 MT and it‚Äôs the GL, PvP sucks as fury/prot or prot, full prot sucks to do anything other than tanking, and so they go DPS to do more with less...but alas, no other warrior tanks want to take another warrior to a 5 person instance because of loot competition. So the washout rate is very high and there‚Äôs a lot of warriors that become alts.
---

stop saying that stupid fucking word "leeway"
---
This post, about the healthy foods. When you wake up, meal prep all your meals for that day. If you do that you have more time to play and will most likely eat healthier. Also while flying, why not do a few sit-ups or pushups?
---
Amazing! Definitely can't wait for all the great WPvP moments it definitely makes the game alive and full of excitement. 
---
Work as much overtime as possible if you're not salary from here till release.  Time will go by quicker, bosses will love you(maybe), and you'll be in a better financial situation to call out "sick" a few days if you're lacking vacation time.
---
ENFP-A, protection warrior.
---
I would always say I refuse to summon anyone not making an effort to get there. Anyone trying to i would, but i say it up front. 
---
I was a warlock in vanilla I know about it and soulstone is something done when you're doing something not randomly asked about in ironforge. At least it never happened to me.
---
I guess you make a confusion with TBC where indeed there were some macros that pretty much handled the rotation automatically
---
In Vanilla, as far as I know there is no macro that will help you weaving efficiently your aimshots between autoshots in particular.
---
Lots of hunter use an addon to know when they should start channeling their aimshots in order not to delay their autoshots
---
Didn't do quests because I didn't like them. Literally just grinded mobs to level. I hated 10 year old me. Oh and didn't even know about talent points until I was 25, then just randomly put them in because I couldn't be bothered. I'm amazed I got to 40 as a warrior just doing that.
---
You're confusing two totally different issues. 
---
With dual spec, we're talking about the tradeoff of mastery in a single aspect of the game, be it raiding, solo, pvp, vs a system that allows you to perform optimally in any facet of the game. And frankly yes, those trade offs do result in emergent and exciting gameplay, as the raid minmaxers try and figure how to do their best in world pvp, and the pvpers try and figure out how to maximally contribute to raiding.
---
What you're really talking about is the problem of shit-tier specs, where certain specs are just non-functional in nearly any aspect of the game. here I agree with you. I really really do wish they'd have taken a more evolutionary approach to classic and voiced a willingness to continue iterating on class design, or at the very least give each class another refresh patch. 
---
Dual spec is the opposite of what you want. What I think you're saying you want, and what I know I want, is further work on specs to flesh them out. Dual spec is giving up on balance and saying "screw it, you guys just take two specs at once, because we can't fix this shit." This was a somewhat understandable approach in WotLK where the spec system was becoming unwieldy as more and more talents were added, but for vanilla with its smaller talent trees, I really do believe further iteration could get us to a point where all of the specs are fleshed out and functional without stepping on class balance. But sadly Blizz has decided not to go that way, c'est la vie.
---
laughs in red bandana
---
I‚Äôm on the fence about this one. It would be convenient, but something about being present and face to face with another player is what made this game great.
---
"Time Elapsed: 19 hrs 20 mins." Love it.
---
I think the same thing applies, but zone lvl +5 as cap, instead of player lvl +5
---
some of my first wpvp experiences were here.  I wandered down from ashenvale and got lost and killed many times \^..\^
---
Server reputation meant something.
---
If a guild always ripped off the pugs, it would stop getting pugs because people knew they were going to get scammed.
---
Delete this shitpost, the values are correct.
---
I don't know exactly how this would play out, but I would LOVE to have Classic have an ending point of added content (i.e. no more raids with better gear, no more levels added, etc)
---
Someone mentioned the other day how a big difference between Classic and Retail WoW is that in Classic you are able to take time away from the game and not miss out on anything. You can pickup right where you left off when you log back in. In Retail if you don't login for a day then you're a day behind on your dailies.
---
It would be really refreshing to not have to deal with the anxiety of "I HAVE TO LEVEL/GEAR UP AS FAST AS I CAN BEFORE THE NEXT PATCH OF CONTENT COMES OUT AND I'M BEHIND AGAIN!!!"
---
Who do you think is workin on Classic now? Where do you think they're going to get more people if they need to make more content for Classic? 
---
The reason why Classic is good is because they're re-creating a design thats already done. They're not making anything new.
---
If having 10% more health is the difference between you succeeding or dying then you are killing the wrong mobs in the first place.
---
Leveling professions are always objectively going to slow you down compared to not doing it. The only exception might be skinning and vendoring the skins, as it lets you afford a mount at 40 more easily while also letting you train abilities.
---
Real friends play alliance. Go night elf and get some new ones.

Hello, Im looking to level as a undead holy priest

NA, Horde, Central time
---
Id be happy to be someones pocket healer basically, I have a fairly open schedule, only having to actually be at my office a few days a week
---
Huntards are the fastest leveling class, are the easiest class to pick up and one of the hardest to master. They do very decent damage PvE and are beasts in PvP.
---
You mean smaller scale. Layering isn‚Äôt crossrealm like it is on retail. It just spreads people over multiple instances for server stability.
---
It do be like that
---
Same here :) it's going to be a slow way up to 60 but I'll love every minute of it as I did 14 years ago :)
---
This. The vast majority of people here want as close to a recreation of Vanilla as Blizzard can do. If people want a game filled with features that pander to those too lazy to invest time in the game then they should stick to retail.
---
It really is! If you've beaten the game before I recommend doing a challenge of some kind. Some of the ones I've done:
---
- No magic users
---
- ALL magic users
---
- No ranged characters
---
- No NPCs
---
- Before you can learn a new job you have to 100% finish the current job you have.
---
I played BFA for one month, let the sub run out. Haven't subbed since. I considered for literally HALF a second to sub to get the chance of getting into beta, but I kept reminding myself that Blizzard is just tricking people into giving them money, as they do these days.
---
I'm happy I didn't give in, I would have been ashamed of myself.
---
Archeology. With nerfed rewards it wouldn't give any kind of advantage and I think it's a great lore and flavour feature.

- Aoe

- Dm lasher farm

- Portals + Free gold

- Escape in pvp
---
- Strong in pvp
---
- Lots of CC

The upvotes, they're over 9000!
---
Maybe instead of better gear drops it would just drop a bit more items.
---
I'd say unequivocally that the lack of dual spec in vanilla is an ENORMOUS QOL downside. Dual spec being introduced really did make playing a lot of classes a lot more bearable.

That doesn't mean I want it for classic though. I mean, I definitely won't be playing Shaman again, specifically because of how frustrating it was wanting to be both a crucial member of my raid team (resto spec) and able to do literally anything at all out side of the raid (not resto spec). But it did help a lot with identity, respeccing was just so savage that you really had to commit your character to a single style of play most of the time. You could respec every few weeks to do something different, but it just wasn't sustainable on a several-times- a - week basis.
---
I agree with above statement! ... give this lad a drink!
---
&gt; If they want to get to 60 fast. If they want to enjoy more aspects of the game other than leveling fast and ignoring content, then cooking is a great avenue for that.
---
&gt; alot of the mystique away from Classic
---
Imagine having that mystique after 10+ years of playing that game.
---
Just raid in pvp spev in early phases. MC easy anyways
---
GOD DAMNIT  
---
WHICH HUNTER DID THAT???
---
You're not reading what I'm saying. PI/SW as a healer is viable... so there's zero argument that "well they're bring X extra dps to a raid so they only need to do half damage to be worthwhile". They can just bring another warlock, downgrade a holy priest to PI/SW, and now you're also getting PI to throw on the mage with rolling ignite. There's no world where you can argue that going straight SPriest is better than PI/Disc, and there's zero reason to run both. SPriests definitely should not have debuff slots opened to them, it should go to the warlocks so they can get corruption procs if they have the debuff slots to spare.
---
With most of the streamers being level 30 and having BiS gear, there is very little to actually do. Which is why you see Asmon etc reverting to community driven exercises such as getting to Hyjal or bringing a dragon to SW. 
---
Each of these types of "events" are fun but ultimately are empty experiences and are only to drum up viewers or used as "content".
---
If BFA was in a Legion type state it would be the opposite. Right now there are very few reasons to log into BFA due to lack of content and all of those "events" one might do have been done to death over the years (transmog runs, mount-offs etc).
---
Classic simply has the luxury of FOMO going for it since the vast majority of players don't have access to it and it is "new".
---
Guild bank. It's something that guilds are already going to have a work around for but it's one feature that I think wouldn't negatively impact the classic experience.
---
I agree. Not having the player‚Äôs realm attached to the end of their name is certainly nostalgic
---
When you make a life update video on your YouTube channel ‚Äúguys I‚Äôll be gone for about a month, family matters‚Äù
---
Im not on board with dual spec
---
Single spec only made you have an identity
---
Its the meta for farm content including naxx, but its not the same as the fury dps spec.
---
You can definitely tank any dungeon in a dps fury or arms (or cat) spec though, dps might just have to watch threat a little closer
---
Your talents should be a choice. Choices have positives and negative side effects. 
---
When you add dual spec your removing meaningful decisions that the player has to make. Please, stop asking blizzard to remove meaningful player decisions.
---
The polls are still relatively few people. The vast majority of Classic players don't go to reddit and other websites. Also, there will be a lot more dedicated mages than warlocks because they are better in just about every way. Especially gold grinding and a lot of players choose the mage just because it's easy to farm gold.
---
Don't worry, I don't actually think I was amazing so it's not necessary to go out of your way to try to put me down. The point is that it was a fun nostalgia moment, which is my interest in classic.
---
They said each layer would have a server pop. That makes it cross realm and its the whole game instead of a zone so that makes it a larger scale.
---
There's 2 posts out of the 50 in the front page about Asmon, and they usually prompt lots of discussion (low level cath clear, dragon kiting to bolivar.)
---
&gt;do I want to enjoy the game the way it was intended
---
This thread devolved rather fast into a "my way of playing the game is better than yours"
---
Never not warlock.. fear spam is hilarious
---
I remember healing in Naxx with my hunter, what an epic journey.
---
If you got into the normal beta can you still access that server during the stress test? Didn‚Äôt get a chance to try last week.
---
May be blocked if you‚Äôre on corporate internet due to the massive exploit last year
---
Special shoutout to lvl 26 trollblood regen elixirs, easy to make and life saver for warriors/rogues.
---
People get frustrated with the deadzone in PvP
---
I like this and honestly not a simple change I had considered. I absolutely despise race and faction change, it‚Äôs appalling on so many levels. The barbershop seems like a feature they would have had back in the day if they had been able/wanted to.
---
They have been nothing but positive. I've never watched a stream before in my life before, but had a great time tuning in to watch classic over the past few days. The overall consensus isn't just that Classic is good, but that this is what WoW should be. I bet were going to get even more people to try Classic because of the feedback from streamers.
---
Yup I asked this question yesterday on a stream. Pretty sure you couldn‚Äôt do cheetah form indoors before. I remember because in my hundreds of Druid flag runs, I‚Äôd Cat form, grab flag and sprint to the outside before switching to Cheetah.
---
I get enjoyment out of the entire game, not just the things that start @ 60. 
---
I love taking a slower, more methodical approach to leveling. I try to do most quests, all dungeons, leveling my crafting as a level, and explore a lot.
---
I know it's just personal preference, but by doing this, i get more enjoyment of my limited game time.
---
People don't really do that in retail though, at least the part of group content in retail that 90% of people play: mythic dungeons.
---
yikes not being able to laugh at yourself.. quite defensive there rjojo
---
So I was confused about the last one so let me ask this: 
---
Do you have to attempt to login during the 2-4pm pst time frame in order to login and play later? 
---
For the last stress test I didn‚Äôt get home until after the 3 hours were up and I wasn‚Äôt able to get to character creation. But was that because of the stress test and ques or was it because I was too late to get in and try?
---
The discussion about bolvar not attacking it was worth it.
---
Doesnt matter if the talent has a major impact on your character.
---
1% increased crit chance is big enough for you to feel like you gained something.
---
Going 15 levels without getting any feedback of your character becomming stronger is horrible.
---
&gt; You also could have people selecting the wrong talents, which costs a pretty gold piece to reselect the appropriate talents, after you get rejected and laughed out of groups of elitists or min maxers.
---
Thats a very nihilistic way of looking at it. "Wrong talent" my ass, if i had one wish it would be to change peoples mind that min/maxing should be the average.
---
Thank you so much for the info and especially the links
---
well guess i'll cancel this resub then, i tried! :P
---
so am I right in saying that most people don't run spriests in their comps ? by the logic of SPriest melting face would it not be good on defensive situations and perhaps winning the flag bacj in wsg if you go with someone who can help to cc the healer ? 
---
what dps toons do compete then ? mage and warlock as you mentioned- warrior I'm guessing - anymore? Hunter?
---
Having the second binding I needed drop in MC, and just casually be given to me, only showing up in the raid chat.  
---
Our group was half full of pugs, so there was a huge outcry as seeing the binding being given without question to a rogue and 12 people quit the party immediately.  
---
On Staghelm I was known as the Gimp Rogue with Thunderfury (and blue pants).
---
Completely server dependent. I‚Äôd look for it to be anywhere from 200 to 600 though
---
Happy to enable you! :D
---
Thanks I think this is definitely what I‚Äôll do. Elixirs will just be in such high demand and I want a profession I can benefit from and make money. Thanks üôèüèª
---
The only decision I have to make is which website to use lol.
---
You could just level two characters
---
You're thinking of TBC where at one point the top hunter spec was the "bind this to your mouse wheel and spin" BM spec. Autoshot weaving made vanilla hunters a relatively complicated spec all things considered.
---
You can, you just have to sit on the outskirts and only pull one at a time with whatever ranged attack you MAY have been blessed with LOL!
---
Right, I wouldn't want to level 1-80 on a WotLk server. I'd personally want to level 1-60 on a classic server, then 60-70 on a TBC server before moving to WotLk. 
---
I feel like I'd be able to get the most out of each expansion that way.
---
Lol allow.
---
Such faith - you remember bfa is a thing right? 
---
Oh wait "classic is a different team"
---
Not being negative, just cautious since blizzard hasn't been the same for about 7 years now :)
---
It really was near perfection. A great balance of PvP and PvE. Then just like many things in WoW Blizz decided to cave to the QQ of a few players.
---
Arena for sure, the simplicity of the talents and specs you have at level 60 really would be awesome for that. I feel like skill would really come into play a lot more.
---
I played for 7 years (since just before TBC) before coming back to classic recently and even I had forgot!
---
&gt; Follow DarkHorse on Twitter and Instagram.
---
You have no content what so ever, why would people even follow if there's nothing there? Just saying.
---
They already changed that.
---
I saw a guy on here offering a few hundred $ for Beta access. I'm sure there are some who would play thousands. It all depends on the depth of your wallet and the thickness of your neckbeard.
---
I fully expect so see a stupid high number of Rogues, Warriors and Mages because people already know those will be the Golden Child classes since they won't be doing any class balancing.
---
Hi, /u/Shav-
---
Not sure about alliance but I think the horde gets the Dragon Head buffs even in Barrens.
---
private servers didn't intentionally overtune dungeons though (at least not the K ones and the nost core ones), they tried to be blizzlike always, and in some cases they just guessed wrong and put too high values. Also, it's not even everything that is tougher on private servers, mobs out in the world have been proven to be actually tougher on classic beta than private servers:
---

---
Sure. Have a better rest of the day :)
---
Enemy cast bars + dot timers.
---
Glad to see that I'm not alone in my insanity. My plan:
---
* Three months to release: Theoretical preparations
---
* Two months to release: Start testing the route 
---
* One month to release: Start testing in duo
---
* Two weeks to release: Start to slowly shift day-night-rhythm
---
* One week to release: Grocery shopping, laundry, housecleaning
---
* Release and after: Play 00:00-18:00, sleep during rush hour

&gt;even if it's done solely for the sake of conversation 
---
People seem to lack the ability to think abstractly.  
---
And to add to the topic, AOE looting would be neat.
---
Aye, which will lead to vanilla being dead I guess again once tbc servers are released... unless they're played by people who just enjoy the process of lvling from.1-60 on the classic patch. 
---
The issue as I see it is surely you'll need a copy of the wow files for every expansion??
---
They literally created Layering to appease those people. And it‚Äôs not permanent nor are sharding and layering the same thing.
---
When I started wow,I went to Redridge and I had sweet memories. But now when I leveled an alt, I hated it.
---
Windows classic
---
It‚Äôs almost like, blizzard didn‚Äôt enforce gold buying 15 years ago the same way they do today
---
What's your current setup? Classic doesn't really need a high end pc.
---
My guess is that after the stress test, shortly after they‚Äôll push the cap up for the Beta to 40 or 45. I think July we‚Äôll see the cap rise to 60, but raids will still be closed. And then August release, obviously.
---
Unfortunately, however, I do not see there being an open beta. They seem to be keeping it pretty tight.
---
I mean I thought it was. Reminded me of coming into SW and getting blasted by Kazzak.
---
Did you even play vanilla?  It definitely depends on the guild makeup, but after the increase in slots and being specc'd SM/Ruin I was able to do amp CoA and corruption, usually topped the damage meters except for the fire mage that caught the rolling ignites.
---
If you‚Äôre into PvP, raid until T2, get the Rok bow and then grind rank 10 or 13 and viper the fuck out of people and enjoy some nice aimed shot crits and being generally annoying.  Scatter, feign, trap is a 1 min CD also which is helpful to GTFO back into range and IMO is one of the most fun combos in the game.
---
The implication is more content has a better chance of reaching more people. Maybe some of it will convince people to play, maybe not. But not having the content will definitely not bring more people to Classic.  Streamer clips might not be something you‚Äôre interested in but for those who maybe have started WoW after vanilla or never played streamer videos could be a unique source of information. 
---
Subreddits are an aggregate of content related to a particular subject/theme. For the life of me I don‚Äôt understand why scrolling past unappealing posts is such an imposition. Report reposts and ignore what you don‚Äôt like.
---
The most important thing for Reckoning Builds is still not tested to my knowledge.
---
If the stacks get purged from cc, there are old post that hint that could have been the case, if sheep, fear, sap , gouge, blind, scatter purges Reckoning the specc is dead, even with the new /sit in game.
---
After that the questin is spellpower scaling of seals and procs, and procs rate.
---
You are right, bwl and naxx are raids where shadow protection potions are in high demand. The thing that makes grave moss so valuable is the scarcity. You are really hard pressed to find it in the open world
---
Skipping slow fall seems a bit extreme imo, it's only 6 silver according to that guide (and there's only 1 rank). 
---
Aside from the convenience (and fun) factor the time saved from never having to wait for elevators and potential shortcuts you can take when fall damage isn't an issue has to work out to be greater than the time it would take to farm 6 silver.
---
Here hoping he hits 60 and then gets banned.
---
A lot of these streamers which inherently fought against Classic WoW for years? Preacher, Towelie etc (dont forget)
---
As a mage you can skip a ton.
---
My first main was a mage. I think I mostly just enjoyed the instance. I also did get the mallet for the summoning of ghazrilla, and those juicy 3% (?) Mount speed.
---
Equivalent of Bloodmyst isles on Kalimdor in TBC.
---
I‚Äôve beaten it several times, but I‚Äôve never done a play through where I set limits like that.
---
The no NPC one is something that would be a lot easier these days because of the advanced jobs like Dark Knight. Still I may do that. I always get attached to my regular army members.
---
That's a good solution. Let people filter out stuff. Cause I'm enjoying the streaming content but not about to force you to see it too
---
Again this shit? Scroll down and read why this doesn't make any sense.
---
I really liked the approach that ESO took. The game had its own problems (fire mage dragon knights in... Well, everything... And vampire stun lock teams in pvp were both absolutely rediculous and clearly untested) but the foundations for a great fun game were there. Their combat mechanics led to some of the most fun I've had in dungeons. Tanking in that game was a joy.
---
Leeeeeewaaaaaaaaay.
---
Nuke it! Dot it!
---
Making twinks is tremendously fun. I think there are two kind of twinks: 1. the lvl 28-29 character who've you've spent some time getting some adequate gear on and 2. the BIS-EVERYTHING twink
---
Casually levelling through the brackets will definitely be miserable, but it doesn't take very much effort at all to meet the criteria for #1, and that will be more than enough to make the BG's enjoyable.
---
I used to have a twink at evvery bracket and never put very much effort into any of them, and they could all hang just fine. Never looked at any BIS lists or anything, just found what I could and made it work.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between cutting Blizzard some slack and telling people to stop stirring the pot and just report a fucking obvious bug.
---
Yea I guess it's % of *overall* damage per tick. Adds up exactly to 33.6%.
---
The plothole was the existance of half-orc characters in the lore like Garona, who were initially half-human-half-orc.
---
How were they supposed to exist if the horde didn't even meet humans until they actually invaded Azeroth through the dark portal?
---
When Draenai got introduced, it was essentially a fix to that plothole, as now the writers could point towards the Draenai and say "Well, half orcs are half draenai, not human!"
---
Nah, I just added them to a list of "good trinkets" thats why I said "some" are obscure, meaning the engi one for example, or the talisman which gives you a ranged silence, ect.
---
Id love to post clear answers but there are none to be had 
---
Now if you are buying a new comp Id say but one that can run BFA decently and it should run classic quite well but at this point thats all we can really say
---
Definitely the case. Bad news is 90% of dps type people most likely won‚Äôt have the patience to level a warrior. We shall see who truly rises to the top!
---
I see, you are a man of culture as well.
---
The hunter (who was streaming too) reported it. A blizz employee probably saw the clip anyway. And it was clearly a joke at the time by Asmon.
---
Then don‚Äôt watch him.
---
I don't believe the 'nostalgia is the only reason to be excited for Classic' theory one bit but I can't help think that when this sub goes crazy about how great Westfall is...
---
Yep this is technically not a real answer to your question, but it is practical advice. Under no situation is dot damage worth losing the ability to sheep/seduce/blind a mob. This is part of the reason that tanking as a dps specced warrior is so infuriating, tossing around worthless Deep Wounds bleeds by accident can get your group killed.
---
OK sotp dots
---
Raids are easy because people are speccing properly for the encounters, if everyone came into the raid with pvp spec it would take several hours more per week to clear content, guess what those hours are the same that I would spend farming gold for respecs anyway, thus defeating the point. But yes I could be a leech and be the only one, I'm not going to do that, I'm a team player.
---
Ok so you‚Äôre full of shit. This doesn‚Äôt happen in retail because you can twink and fly everywhere. Grats finding the only other person playing WoW on your level. 99% of interactions are not even close to this so it‚Äôs a bullshit point.
---
Lmao what advantage?
---
I've spent more time on my ui than I care to admit, and I'm dreading doing it again for classic, just because I almost can't function without a solid ui that is set up how I like it, so I can't start leveling until I do it :(
---
I know others will think that's stupid, but it's just how I am. I wish I could just import my profile to classic. Or at the very least I hope I get into a stress test, so I can set it up ahead of time.
---
I dont think they have any intention to 
---
or at least they have not indicated so
---
there is one already

&gt;Edit: I like how the latest cult mentality is to downvote anyone who alludes to any sort of change to classic, even if it's done solely for the sake of conversation
---
This is honestly a question better left to be asked after about the first year.  Right now, its like you said - for better or worse: cult mentality wants everything to be exactly as they remembered it.  So anything question or conversation will get shat on.
---
But give them 1 year and people will be begging for QOL and new content.  That's really the thing that people haven't realized yet because we aren't there yet.  In order for Classic to flourish beyond the initial time table of content releases: there needs to be QOL and even new dungeons and raids.  Otherwise, its just an experience, not an actual game.
---
Sink
---
Oh I'm not I'll be tac mastery and then fury. My build is great it levels super fast and is able to basically endlessly grind.
---
Lol you‚Äôre in for a surprise. On Pservers AQ40 is being pugged. MC pugs will be going from day 1.
---
Anyone who says there won't be pugs clearly never played Vanilla.
---
Pugging took place on Burning Blade often enough. Obviously not for AQ and Naxx, but everything else was fair game and happened all the time.
---
Areana is pretty terrible with all the pve gear.
---
An OT will need threat and dmg not a little bit of defense from that trinket. Alwats get neck.
---
No there won't be open beta, they already stated that they have enough people in the beta for testing atm and aren't really sending out invites anymore.
---
&gt; Ok so you‚Äôre full of shit.
---
In what way?
---
You can't take my experience away from me, so what exactly am I full of shit about? What did I claim that was full of shit?
---
Dungeon Finder!  
---
&gt;!lol relax guys, jk. Put the gun away!&lt;
---
What is MCP?
---
Tell that to the hunter...
---
I always played Rogue and Warrior in Vanilla. I want to try hunter this time and I am fully expecting hate towards that decision. I won't raid so I am not worried about being weak at later tiers.
---
So used to the steamer hate right it was another comment bashing them
---
I'd like to point out that when WoW was originally released, the was pretty much no endgame at all and they had to rush raid content out because the devs were expecting people to spend time enjoying their progression through the levels, so it's not so much a matter of "my way is the best way" as it is "the game was originally intended to be enjoyed, not powerleveled through."
---
Play the game the way you want, makes no difference to me.
---
Man I‚Äôll be honest, I thought he was serious as well. Browsing Reddit more often lately, I don‚Äôt blame you for believing either hehe.
---
Guild Wars 2 has released two expansions without raising the level cap and people played through all the new content. They did it mostly for the story, partly for the achievements, partly for the gear (if they didn't have a fully ascended set already, which many didn't), partly for the styles (transmog).
---
Favorite memory : there are two, both involve my Troll mage, Locust, on Eredar server. 
---
One was while grinding out my last few levels (I grinded 55-60, and I was very slow) in WPL, a BoE ring (Myrmidon Signet) dropped and I just sat in shock. The best pve guild on the server at the time bought it from me for 600g. 
---
Second was while leveling with my friends in arathi, a 3v4 wPvP battle that lasted an hour, with them trying to lure us into stromgarde. We were on voice chat planning strategies like an early arena fight! 
---
Funniest memory, later in vanilla when I switched to a human warlock that‚Äôs been my main ever since, summoning guildies deep underwater. 
---
Most noob moment, when I was literally a noob, first day logging in as an undead mage, and going on in general chat about how cool the ‚Äúelf zombies‚Äù are. I was just overwhelmed by the game from the start.
---
It's because it was crushed.  I was trying for four and a half hours before I got in.
---
No changes

&lt;Sorry&gt; | NA | PvP | Alliance | EST/CST
---
Introduction:
---
Sorry is a group of close friends and family. We have all experienced Classic WoW, and are excited to have it back. We appreciate a good community, and are looking for players we can get to know and trust. With any MMO we understand max level is just the beginning, but RL is more important to us this time around. With that in mind, we still want to experience ALL aspects from this great game.
---
Goal:
---
Sorry is looking to form a tight group of players before the launch.  We really want to get some fun premade BGs going, but know we will need PvE gear to excel in PvP. Therefore, we expect to run many preraid dungeons to acquire everything we need for raids. We are determined to see all content Classic has to offer - we'll do what it takes!
---
Raid Times:
---
TBD
---
Classes Needed:
---
We are taking anyone interested at this time!

Got an old ass Desktop computer. Logged onto trial Account and couldnt  move for 5 min in orgrimmar. Definitely need a new one
---
&gt; Scatter, feign, trap is a 1 min CD
---
Oh no. What part of that is 1 min CD? I thought it was 30 second
---
The same experience here. 
---
Dinged 120. WPvP for 3 hours, kinda fun. Then ran around at max speed for 6 hours from theme park ride to ride, then quit.
---
For all casual players, gating an expansion behind raids seems somewhat harsh to me. And by not having any possible replacements from gear drops until heroic dungeons also seems to make the content even more boring.
---
Part of the leveling experience in Classic is the hunt for that next weapon to ease the questing.
---
I think your strategy would cause a lot of issues in regards to motivation for doing it.
---
Since it's so rare and used so uniquely it's hard to put a price on, and it varies all the time, some servers 3 drops while leveling, some only 1, some have 5 people wanting to play feral tank, some have just 1. That's what makes the difference. But you're looking at several hundred gold. Like the other guy said, 200-600 sounds reasonable.
---
So tomorrow I have to work during the 3 hour window but since I‚Äôm invited I can try and login when I get home and still have a chance to get in and make a character?
---
For raids i dont think your bleeds will stay up for long  with the 16 debuff limit
---
Hi, /u/Daffy82
---
Goblin rocket helm is boe, you just need to find a goblin engr to make one for you.  
---
Gnomish death ray is quite useful on paladin is BoP, so that alone is enough reason to go gnomish.  
---
More important to me is eventually you get the teleporters, gnomish takes you to tanaris, quite close to DM and AQ.  Goblin takes you to winterspring, which isn't particularly close to anything useful.
---
That's where layering comes in. Go to a layer that isn't full.
---
Unless you honestly believe that come launch they will have 100 layers per server and everyone will be able to get in.
---
Doesn't have to be 10 hour queues, it's not like back in the day where they couldn't keep up b with player demand... unless we just want to give them a pass again. 
---
Let's pretend they plan on having 5 layers each server - they've said they want to keep server pop around what it was in Vanilla, that's 15k players.
---
Let's say 40% fall off by month 1 -
---
That's still 9k players... do you really believe they will merge that server into 1 layer? No, they'll just have 3 layers since they don't want to have queues.
---
Let's pretend each server has 3 layers... that's still 5,400 people on 1 server after the first month, will they allow that on 1 layer? By what they have said so far... no.
---
All that headache only to not have queues and let people phase into each others group.
---
In Vanilla if we had friends on 4 different servers we had to decide to re-roll on the same server or play separately.
---
Also if you get gear that looks great or is notably powerful its nice to see people come up mirin on you
---
No single expansion since Wrath of the Lich King was enjoyable to play for more than a couple months. WoD made me quit the game for over a year because I disliked it so much. 
---
While I liked Legion at first, I was so bored and disinterested in the game at that point that I quit in November 2016 and swore I would never play WoW again. Classic is the one and only reason I‚Äôll ever play again. 
---
I didn‚Äôt even bother buying BFA. From the sheer amount of controversy, the frustrated player base, and the numerous poor decisions Blizzard has made with it, I‚Äôm really glad I stopped when I did.
---
Will you be committed or are you just stopping by for your nostalgic fix?
---
Right now? I dont really know
---
I think im committed, see I played back in vanilla but never really got to endgame so im excited to get into it 
---
but while im super hyped now.... there is a chance i have just eaten to many member berries 
---
either way im excited
---
someone better tranq shot
---
More and more evidence that Vanilla elites were actually quite weak. I find it sad, but thanks a lot for putting efforts into the detailed research.
---
It‚Äôs pretty good if you are able to slow fall a far distance but you can get away with just blink falling to avoid as well if you‚Äôre a cheapo
---
I think if you can run BFA on 1 settings, you could run Classic on 10. I was running Classic on max everything, and it was completely smooth. So a decent setup could run Classic fine.
---
I did it because honestly, Olandu, Beowulf, and Agrias just walk over the game.
---
I'd say given how contentious ever single one of the many, many posts on duel spec is would put your "unequivocally" declaration under some serious scrutiny. Many of us believe that duel spec was one of the single worst things to ever happen to WoW as it devastated a large swath of relevant player choice, and reduced the variety of specs you'd see out in the real world as no longer were people forced to compromise between different roles.
---
Well its the beauty of Vanilla, having restrictions to make the game not "fair" for everyone.
---
Lvl 60 In a week? First time i played Vanilla it took me several months.
---
Exactly. having to spec burning rush just to keep up tagging the mobs so I show up on the dps meter or run ahead and get some casts off, etc. I couldn't do it for more than 1 day at 120.
---
What about a separate subreddit for streamer videos?
---
Blind faith considering layering is in and will be in at launch - which still = phasing.
---
Thanks for that! 
---
I think winterspring is a farming hotspot?
---
I hope so, people really shouldn't be raiding in garbage specs...
---
Were u 11 like me and had no idea u could bind abilities to letters like x c z f? I remember when I hopped on private servers and realized I could do that and was like wow I could‚Äôve been a monster back in the day.
---
Without seeing the players armor the data is unusable, you need to see the armor so that you can calculate how much the mob hits for base, and compare that to beta values. But nice post anyway.
---
What!? Seriously!? I was (and going to be) a filthy casual in Vanilla. Did some light raiding and slaying Onyxia was one of those moments which a remember as the highlight of my career.
---
With the 16 debuff limit, 1 hemo rogue per raid makes sense because it is a decent debuff.
---
Saving for later, thanks!!
---
Don't raid in garbage specs unless you're in a very casual guild that doesn't care about any progression.
---
Absolutely. No arguments there. The premise of this thread seemed to be how valuable these items can be to assist in leveling. In reality just gaining more levels would be more valuable (better spells, better raw stats)
---
No multiple difficulty tiers, thanks
---
I've played full resto druid raid spec in vanilla and cat form still does good dmg, even with full resto gear.
---
Feral gear + cat while full resto/balance spec is still p easy damage for soloing the open world.
---
I do agree that the Beta/Stress values are correct since Classic is based on 1.12 and not Vanilla 1.1.0; however, your extreme negativity speaks volumes about your personal character.
---
Lol appease who? The ppl who didnt want sharding dont want layering. You cant call black white then just have ppl believe its white. It is 100% garbage and needs to not be in classic. 
---
Or actually i want them to have it in classic, just give us a few servers without it. That way ppl like you can go play your solo game with a bunch of random npcs and ppl like me can play a MMO
---
Fave memory was the first time walking into Org and just being in awe of the size [was my first MMO].
---
Funniest moment was greifing in world PvP with IRL friends. 5 hr brawl in and around the pirate camps near Tanaris. Was magic even tho we were only around lol 40.
---
I'll be rolling a Shaman. I like flex picks and my main last go around was a Druid.
---
Biggest tip is to lvl your first aid skill. Dem bandaids are a huge help
---
Last week there was a ~3 hour period where the closed beta servers were offline during the stress test. Then the closed beta servers opened back up and the stress test server stayed up for another day or so.
---
I'm not sure if they've announced how they'll be handling this one.
---
I bet OP will feel pretty retarded when he finds out what Warlocks can do once they hit late AQ40 and Naxx, then spec to DS/Ruin.
---
In my guild the hunters were really really close and we had our own hunter chat.  Lots of people tried to get in on it because we had so much fun in there and only a select few were allowed to stay(no raid leaders or officers were allowed obviously).
---
Well one day we were on chromaggus and we had the kill ability activating around the same time as the tranqshot needed to be fired.  One of the hunters yelled "AVENNNGEEEEE MEEEEEEEE" as he charged out fired the shot and then promptly died. He then said "av...en..ge ....m....eeeeee....".  We almost missed the next tranq because we were all laughing so hard.  
---
He dropped his baller gun that kill and we all passed for him to have it.  
---
Another time one of the hunters was having a real hard time in real life and although it was other peoples turn, or we wanted loot, we all passed it for her so she could feel better.  Same with passing on the chest piece from Nef so I could get my full set bonus even though I was behind others on DKP.
---
Like I said we were tight that way.
---
No they don't. Pop-culture consumers will always gravitate towards the new how shit. Wow is no longer the now hot shit so people leave to play Fortnite or whatever.
---
The sub bleeding nowadays is hardly majorly classic veterans LOL
---
Sweet, more raid invites for the rest of us.
---
the mages, warriors, and rogues were all very bad
---
Wait, so you actually get more XP for delaying exploration? So if I wanted to maximize available XP from exploration, I should wait until level 11+ to explore Mulgore?
---
I'm trying to plan a pacifist route to see how far I can get in the game without killing any mobs, so maximising XP from exploration is actuallly super important to bridge the gaps between non-violent quests :P
---
Red Ridge is a newb's introduction to what life is like on a PvP server. I still remember the first Undead Rogue that appeared out of nowhere and sapped me, all those years ago.
---
This isnt the case for ALL hybrid specs though.
---
30 Feral 21 Resto gets 5/5 heart of the wild, and thus is the druid healer with the highest mana pool. It's the best spec for decurse-heavy fights and has enough longevity to be a viable raid healer even in a lot of optimal setups. 
---
Likewise Paladins only need 30 in Holy to get everything they need, everything else is just fluff. So a 30 Holy 21 Prot spec is a viable raid spec for any hardcore guild that lets the paladin get BoSanctuary with no reductoin to their healing power, and thus lets the Paladin be a very capable offtank as 21 prot gets armor, threat, shield talents and BoSanc, you only miss 1h spec and holy shield.
---
Not all are viable everywhere but even in the hardcore content there were some hybrid and utility specs that one or two members of the raid would benefit to take.
---
The fact that Classic will have layering while private servers have dynamic respawns alone adds too much noise to give a good answer.
---
Warden Staff is overrated though. If you're a tryhard feral, survivability shouldn't be an issue and instead you're going to spam MCP for threat. If not, you don't want an expensive weapon.
---
Clearly I should've agreed that every case of clicking on someone's name is some sort of obsession. Yeah, no, that's exactly what grasping at straws is. I clicked on your name to have some good laugh because of how funny and ironic your posts were and I thought I made that clear enough in my first reply. It's the special kind of fanboy-hater dynamic in which every side keeps insulting each other with such fervor that you're not really sure who's truly blinded by rage and it's hillarious. It gets boring after a while tho.
---
Anyway, I'm turning replies off for this post. Maybe to prove that I'm truly not obsessed, maybe it's because it got boring, because I can propably expect the same kind of reply. Have a nice day/evening.
---
Correct.  Nobody likes hunters
---
I feel like arenas to classic is inevitable.  Not with right away of course, but after about the first year, this would probably be one of the first features to get added.
---
Old joke is old. The target market for wow classic is guys in their 30s.
---
I have to agree with the OP. Please eliminate this infestation of Asmongold world first scratching his crotch or whatever. We need more discussions in the limelight, not this stupid advertising.
---
The grind from 105 to 110 is awful I would rather spend 60 days getting to 60 than 2 days getting to 110. The experience just doesn‚Äôt give any incentive to level.
---
Rofl. Blizz sure does making the Alliance look like badasses all the time and turning Horde leaders into fucking jokes.
---
Committed or Nostalgia? Probably both. That first month will let me know though. Worse case scenario, I'll waste $15. 
---
Hoping for the best.
---
That ad is targeted based off of your browsing history
---
No change is fine at the start.  But if you want classic to be more than just an experience, changes are inevitable.
---
Yeah, they were added as the last patch before they started doing Burning crusade stuff, they‚Äôre just going to skip the 2 year wait this time.
---
I really miss the old ranks
---
They aren‚Äôt the same thing. And it is an either or situation, the servers and zones won‚Äôt be able to handle the population. Especially if we only get a few mega servers.
---
During vanilla I went alchemy, I had a bag full of buff potions. Every time I would finally decide to drink up, I would die within 10 minutes, so I ended up just hoarding them even more
---
i chose mage over lock because alliance so i dont rage as much because of will of the forskaken. and mage feels more mobile. i dont like just standing/facetanking. with soullink and fearing
---
Why are you lying to us? This community already has enough toxicity as it is! 
---
I lost all my hope in humanity because of you. Hope you're proud of that.
---
:'(
---
The thing is, it makes a lot of people a lot of money at the cost of something they don't really care about. So sadly, it's going to keep happening :(
---
anduin becoming an adult despite those two kids running around where one wants to break the others toy still being kids in the same period of time. those two are ageless beings.
---
&gt; class balance, the only reason not to do this is pure nostalgia 
---
Assuming this post isn't a troll, you don't seem to have thought this one through
---
&gt; Did you even play vanilla?
---
&gt;It definitely depends on the guild makeup
---
Sure if you play without rogues warriors and mages then locks have a chance at topping meters but who cares? Thhat's not realistic
---
&gt;I was able to do amp CoA
---
Once again, trash guild
---
&gt;usually topped the damage meters
---
Your melee had brain damage?
---
I agree nostalgia isn‚Äôt bad, just easy and I think people stigmatize bc of that.  
---
I think over the years wow lost what made the fans love it.  It definitely got popular enough to attract a mainstream audience but lost something in that process.  
---
For me it‚Äôs going to be heavily driven by nostalgia.  I played wow at the end of high school and through college.  I still have muscle memory from vanilla PvP :-/. I love and hate that game
---
Well thanks for the advice man. Those talents definitely give you enough self peel and pressure in a fight so I'll def try to remember to grab those when classic drops. One more question though...do hunters have any reliable way to deal with snares? Mages rogues and warriors all have spammable slows that can shut down your kiting otherwise. I feel like I'd have the most problems with that.
---
Well, nobody really ever had any reason to go there. I played tons of WSG in vanilla and don't remember that door.
---
...
---
Focus existed before Blizzard added a convenient name for it in the API.
---
My line of thinking as well.
---
Honestly I tuned into his stream and he was just shutting on Classic mechanically. Then later on he had multiple people checking dungeons then resetting for a certain mob... he doesnt seem like he really likes playing for the most part. Does seem kinda miserable. But there are other people that seem like they really enjoy themselves so I just personally wont watch him.
---
I only played seriously in Vanilla, and I remember the carrier showing up on the map after either 30 or 30 minutes. It was to prevent someone from just hiding and making the match take forever. Definitely in vanilla though.
---
What?
---
I plan on only doing tank stuff for some aoe farming and power leveling people in dungeons at 60. Before that I just throw a shield on in ret spec and go for it. Just not an ideal option, I‚Äôd be better healing for a dungeon group even as Ret
---
Orlandu can solo almost every battle
---
Get me my pitchfork
---
Sounds like a solid plan, maybe something I can do while I wait for classic.
---
Of course its either or. Blizz would never do both because they dont want to be proven wrong. Im 90% sure they want classic to fail so they can be like "see we told you that you didnt want this" so they are putting shit in that ppl who have been asking for vanilla forever would never want.
---
Only reason im not saying 100% is cuz they didnt announce a cash shop yet. Sure it will be there within a year tho.
---
&gt; Do you have to attempt to login during the 2-4pm pst time frame in order to login and play later?
---
No you don't.  That sounds like it was because of the login issues of the stress test.  You should be able to get in.  Maybe keep trying and make sure client is fully updated (they pushed updates during the test).
---
I was a poor high school student when I got most of those.  :(  I made due with what I had!
---
Grindr will do that
---
No, you're right. It is 30 seconds. Feign Death and Scatter Shot both have a 30 sec CD, traps 15 sec.
---
/r/warcraftlore has a couple of guides on reading order!
---
I can't imagine that there would be any computer or laptop made in the past decade that would not run classic wow in a perfectly playable state.
---
I would bet that you could build a computer for $300 and use integrated graphics and play at 60fps on the "classic" (1) graphics setting.
---
In vanilla, it definitely put a cap on my fun. Eventually I gave up and stayed in my PvP spec, sure it gimped groups but grinding gold just wasn‚Äôt fun on a PvP server and I didn‚Äôt no-life it. Still had fun, woulda had more fun with dual spec.
---
This is the only thing I'd personally bring in. Not having this in kind of encourages account sharing. Even if they don't add all the features, like taxing guildies mobs for guild bank money or anything like that this is a change that im 100% for.
---
One feature. One. 1...
---
&gt; start getting balance changes, and new content 
---
Big yikes
---
Well surely switching your layer mid-combat isn't necessary for it to work.
---
Yeah fuck it, I'm tipping this guy just for showing up
---
You sound like you don't wanna play classic then?
---
OCD it is then!
---
Brought to you by staysafe
---
There's no way they'll raise it to 60. Asmon and the like will be streaming raids before the official release and the hype will die down.
---
if youre doing skinning its just as well.
---
*You're damn right*
---
Fuck off this sub. Your just here to stir the pot. Nothing Blizzard has done shows they want Classic to fail and if anything they want it to succeed to see what they need to improve on with Retail to get subs higher.
---
Yep, the K server has long been scorned for being "easymode", when it's far more accurate in reality. Players from other pservers are in for a shock in classic. Should be entertaining.
---
You need help.
---
I think a decent offtank can do twice or thrice the DPS of a melee hunter with Nightfall, while having the same uptime thanks to Hamstring.
---
Auto dismount when casting spells. It's possibly the greatest quality of life change and nobody even realizes it.
---
Yet this is advertising in the WoW section, where retail streams are also abundant.
---
Not only that, but the Eredar (what the Draenei are) were supposed to be the evil race that made Sargeras go mad and start the Burning Legion if I remember correctly.
---
Chose promise : [https://imgur.com/a/9M6ufbl](https://imgur.com/a/9M6ufbl)
---
261 - 90. What a champion!
---
Lol
---
Cdew died more times before level 20 than he did in 5 years of Blizzcon Arena tournaments
---
Highly unlikely considering they way they have designed the beta access at the moment. They seem to be utilising the hype to encourage people to resubscribe. I'm just waiting till release.
---
Pretty sure you can't get an invite without a sub. Sorry. :(
---
They're not running the 2004 engine. Computers from that era wouldn't run classic wow
---
you can do this
---
At the best prices, yes, but not cheaper than the 900g most of us are going to pay at Exalted and certainly not cheaper than the 800g anyone at Rank 3 PVP will pay.
---
Westfall doesn‚Äôt have enough quests for 10-20. I Usully have to do loch modan as well.
---
Lol. Ya thats why they are implementing the feature that destroyed server communities on retail. They rly understand what the players want.
---
ENFJ shaman-mage-warrior lol
---
I bet you will feel pretty retarded when you find out what the bloodvine set is
---
Warlocks dps becomes more competitive when bloodvine is released - it's clear you aren't speaking from personal experience or you would know this
---
Mages, warriors, and rogues should ALWAYS do more dps than warlocks ceteris paribus
---
Every single poll I see looks about 60h-40a.
---
No that's not what it sounds like.
---
It sounds like I would prefer spending as much time on classic ganking people on my big boomer orc female rogue, rather than sit in BRD pickpocketing for gold.
---
But I'll gladly play either way.
---
If you incorporate a bit of grinding you can severely cut down on downtime, but you're right.
---
Horde 1 Alliance 1000
---
Noobmaster, hey, it‚Äôs Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy, if you don‚Äôt log off this game immediately I will fly over to your house, come down to that basement you‚Äôre hiding in, rip off your arms and shove them up your butt! Oh, that‚Äôs right, yes, go cry to your father you little weasel!
---
You kind of can with macros. 
---
Make a single macro and on each line make a new /equip &lt;item name&gt; line. You'll have to update the macro every time you get a new piece of gear, but hey its still doable.
---
Someone needs to link this video and OP‚Äôs video and then play the curb your enthusiasm theme song over it. So perfect. Love the little payo
---
Pretty sure the guy that came up with the idea of the pretty Draenei admitted he forgot about the original Draenei/Broken.
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Metzen\_on\_lore](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Metzen_on_lore)
---
Which is all just coincidental, but congrats to you :)
---
Pretty sure you can still select "Back" as a subtype of armour types, when you're searching items in the Auction house
---
The values are correct. You have 15 years of experience making your skill ceiling higher. In 2004 you sucked at the game so you couldn't do what you can do now.
---
They have done the math over and over and over. it is accurate.
---
No, I was trying to describe a crazy contrived example based on what the person above was saying where someone never disconnects from a day 1 layer and will eventually have to get DC‚Äôd
---
Hi, /u/DMorVC
---
Transmog for sure.
---
This is an MMO. We should be able to look how we want to. Customization is the point.
---
You can only wear gear you unlock, so it's not like the prestige is gone from unlocking good gear.
---
The idea that you can't tell what someones gearlevel is by visuals doesn't hold any water at all with me.
---
I have not played the "WoW Classic" that is currently in beta but I can already feel the frustration back in classic. Thanks for bringing the frustration back to me. D:
---
Relax; you don't need to know everything to enjoy the game.  Classic is designed for people to experience the game in their own way and it doesn't matter if you're in that group that races to 60 in order to clear the raids as quickly as possible.  Just play however comes naturally to you and you'll be fine.
---
How can you possibly say that? You propose a core game change and then just say "I think it wouldn't negatively impact Classic".
---
Let's just be perfectly clear: You have no way of knowing that, at all. Which is why it should never be implemented.
---
No. Im pretty sure i only ever said and ever will say sharding destroyed server communities. Well actually cross realm anything rly but sharding put the nail in the coffin.
---
And ya atm they are saying its not permanent but that rides on the expected 3 to 4x a server pop quitting on each server. If no one quits you can bet your ass they aint turning it off.
---
Sure you did. You can be sure i got that impression from your OP.  Thanks for confirming it with your reply.
---
Don't know what game you've been playing but if you say that hunters don't fall of and Warlocks are't top tier DPS, then i suggest making a guide to show people the light.
---
You just need an active subscription to play Classic when it comes out.  You do not have to have the latest expansions in order to play Classic.
---
That's an ok way to Do things. I remember it beeing done too back in the days.
---
I understand why there is a respec cost, I'm simply arguing that 25 as the cap is more reasonable than 50. 
---
The idea of giving up some pvp power to be better in pve or vice versa does sound nice, I like that and I do it on many classes. But it's just not feasible as a rogue.
---
I am not saying I want the perfect spec, I was arguing that it doesn't exist, and I'm glad to pay the toll, but I think the game would be better with a 25g toll than 50.
---
Yo so I read this whole thread and I‚Äôve been left with one burning question... are you retarded?
---
From my experience on private servers and the beta prot pallies are very much viable in dungeons and i've seen paladins tank bosses in alterac valley and mc but its Always easier to take a warrior for any content you cant steamroll because you dont have to put so much rescources into the tank. PI and innervate for example. 
---
Priest pov
---
If I can hit lvl 50 in the first month ill be happy. Always spend too much time flying around to quest with friends or making alts
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler.  It's a drop from gnomer that can be farmed - it increases attack speed by a substantial amount for a short duration and has 3 charges.  Since druids don't use the actual weapon damage in its attack calculation, this can greatly increase threat generation.
---
I plan on just playing the game without any goals. I‚Äôm now too old and have more important things to do than worry about doing 14 hour gaming sessions to race to 60
---
Good memories playing Warlock and dropping an Infernal in Alterac Valley, being a damned-near dungeon boss to take down.
---
classicdb and/or twinstar are better IMO, at least from my experience with the Beta so far.
---
Why would you do this to yourself? You sound like your well aware of what classic entails but yet keep voicing displeasure in so many aspect of classic.
---
I know classic isn't perfect but I'll take it, along with it flaws, than many other games today including retail. So what is it that you're actually looking for?
---
Sharding
---
Said no one ever
---
whew. ty.
---
Having played a tauren warrior for 14 years, I can tell you that ghome rogues in particular can be extremely irritating to play against in PvP.  They are so small, and difficult to track/target sometimes.
---
Professions take a lot of time, especially if you gold starve and have to optimize every copper. I think you're doing fine.  I also think it's way more fun to be suboptimal when you level your first N chars.
---
Both of your linked examples have zero to do with pserver vs anti-pserver crowds. Both are generic streamer "hate" posts. Provides zero value to your argument. You could complain about those posts for "hating on streamers", but they are irrelevant to the discussion at hand.
---
Wait, so at 2100 AP, is BT more damage per cast, or more damage per rage cost?
---
Or another way of asking: if I am in execute phase, and I have 2100 AP or above, should I prioritise BT over execute?
---
As far as i remember pve was never locked in vanilla. Just pvp so you couldnt like 
---
"hey log onto your gnome and /who that person to see if they hearthed or something."
---
Definitely this.  If you are willing to take the time and fish/cook, you should always have a good food option for your level.
---
Caves and fortresses can sometimes be stupid hard on pservers because of the dynamic spawns, not the case in Classic
---
Level swiftly and try farm as much gold as the game's 32bit-integer can handle
---
Playing and hopefully leveling efficiently. Stoked for pvp servers again. This time I'll mostly duo or trio with friends the whole way up.
---
Now Blizzard doesn‚Äôt have to worry about reset logging because nobody logs in at all.
---
You got really lucky! Congrats.
---
Some hardcore guilds will probably go for hunter, the rest can go shamans/paladins or whatever lower tier DPS.  It won't matter that much for most guilds.
---
His guild first killed Onyxia when other guilds were working on C'Thun. I don't think there were that many "next raids" or a big concern about them.
---
Stay away from horde pls. We dont need these scrublet wannabe elves running around org. Plus asmongold plays alliance so go play with him :)
---
Should be able to do some offtanking with that spec too.
---
Reread my comment. I said that ‚Äúraids will still be closed‚Äù, but yeah, that‚Äôs why I said it.
---
Agree with nimeral, lvl36 in 16hrs is just impossible. Your pserver must give out 5x or more xp per mob/quest
---
Retail bad
---
not to burn out.
---
It was all about game systems and vision and not about a controlled experience.
---
They can't manage to control it and make it fun.
---
Damage meters in bg's
---
Hey man, 
---
I like what you said about pvp. This is really where my game is at. I got a young family and fulltime job so it's hard to do raids and shit because of the time. But battlegrounds you can just do anytime and I sort of love that. 
---
So at least now I know I can hold my own (with practice)
---
Kudos to you for holding strong.
---
Same with transmog. How many players in modern wow do you go up to and look at their armor in order to see what they've done? I bet the answer is 0. Most people are transmogged to something different in modern wow and it completely ruins immersion imo.
---
No, but Paladins and Warlocks will have to unless they buy the 900g one's like the rest of us.
---
I‚Äôd have to go with guild banks.
---
On beta I was able to outrun mobs and kite them  without hamstring at level 1
---
Going back to mulgore to show lower levels where fitzsprocket is while mining copper because durotar was packed was great.  Gotta get my tauren brethren that beautiful goblin smasher.
---
You can make a ton of extra money while leveling by just selling these cooked items too though.  Jungle Stew specifically sells for like 75s a stack IIRC - and in STV you're going to be killing a lot of tigers.  Vendoring the ingredients by themselves will yield like 7s at best.  Don't discount the amount of money certain classes/prof combos will need to make up to get that mount, Cooking helps in more ways than one in vanilla.
---
Nah, not really.  As I got older I got more other hobbies like hiking and photography and shit and jsut became pickier and pickier with how my time was spent.  I honeslty think most peopel don't seek variety enough and end up spending their time unwisely..........  NOW IT"S TIME TO WASTE 6 MONTHS OF MY LIFE AGAIN ON THE SAME GAME.... although to be fair, WoW classic is going to be a giant social event, so not the same as most games for me.  I already have people i haven't heard from in 12 years hitting me up on battle.net for classic.
---
You young bucks are gonna get a lesson.

I agree, never cared for transmog
---
Now I just need the spell damage coefficients for the procs from Heart of Wyrmthalak and the Lifestealing enchant and I can properly calculate my end-game damage output. :D
---
Skinning is good money for everybody early on, since you get a personal bonus from every beast kill. Vendor the low-level skins and bank the higher level ones for when people start needing them. Warlocks have a great BoP robe they can make with tailoring and you can also make bags for yourself and to sell, tailoring is a good option too.
---
That's pretty cool.
---
Tailor enchanter for the lock, skinning leatherworker for the rogue. You‚Äôll want to be able to make some of your own gear. 
---
While leveling the tailor and leatherworker send anything you don‚Äôt need to the enchanter to DE. I paid for epic flying on 6 characters during vanilla by selling mats.
---
My experience from vanilla was that the dungeons in general were quite easy, only time I remember struggeling was in ZF being underleveled at the stairs event. And that was on my first char, being a complete noob, like everyone else. The main factor was that tanks would use 5 sec to swap target due to keyboard turning and mouseclicking, and healers waiting 10 sec between each heal etc. If you leveled alts with someone who had already a 60 char and some experience, most of the leveling dungeons would be a breeze. 
---
There are some tricky parts in BRD, Sunken Temple and Mauradon (if you do it early for thrash blade). But none of the sub 30 dungeons were very challenging. And iirc it would be pretty comming to rush or chainpull most of the low level dungeons later in vanilla as people leveled more alts. 
---
I'm looking forward to classic for sure, but I find it very odd how people think the dungeons are too easy. When thats just what they were like. 
---
PS: Not saying there arnt any  bugs whatsoever, some mobs might do slightly too little or whatever. But even if its fixed, no sub 30 dungeon will be hard for someone who has played the game for 15 years, or even 2.
---
To be honest this is my biggest worry. I always burn out no matter what I play.
---
Awesome.
---
Worked the night shift during the first stress test (which started around midnight here in EU). This time around it starts almost at midnight and Thursday is a public holiday. I work the night shift Friday which means I have to fuck up my circadian rhythm before work anyways. 
---
26 h session incoming, hoping to spend at least some of that time in the game and not the queue.
---
If you're hardcore, you should have no issues farming 50g to respec.
---
I would just find someone to pocket heal. Warlock, rogue, warrior, etc
---
warlock was always my first choice because they fought to keep me alive the hardest as a pocket healer.
---
I think you're onto something...
---
Again, fine for the start, but makes no sense in the long run.  You do know that between the launch of vanilla to the end, there were 12 major patches and about 25 other minor ones?  To say no changes.  To have no changes wouldn't even be the vanilla experience because experiencing the changes and patches was part of vanilla.
---
As long as they can PvP I'm good to go and play. 
---
I played a warrior one. It's was a rather boring experience. 
---
While playing hunter it kinda seemed like everyone is cool other than you.... But in my heart I know I was having a lot of fun.
---
A perfect classic is what I'm looking for. I know I won't get it but while waiting for it I'll do my part to fight for it.
---
I love the game even with all its flaws, I can understand why someone would see it as me disliking it when I argue for something to be improved, but that's just not the case.
---
You need passion for a game to yell at it :D
---
Good points!
---
I think if you leveled a Tauren Druid you‚Äôll find there is much elegance to find in their culture, mannerisms, and appearance.
---
Won't this hurt my performance too much healing wise in raids or dmg wise in pvp?
---
It really depends on how much side content you do. I think my vanilla Witcher 3 playthrough ended up with almost 125 hours of playtime, and I feel like I did about half of the side content. If you started now you could definitely get through the story of the entire game with some time left over to complete optional stuff.
---
why is noone in quotation marks?
---
That puts you way over world first, so I highly doubt it unless you provide proof.
---
Phasing != layering, phasing is in regards to a small area and to a quest like the wrath gate before and after those are phases.
---
Layering is based off sharding and is being tested as an improvement of it.
---
It's not blind faith, it's just how things are, new systems are put in place, system WHICH THEY DIDNT NEED TO DEVELOP, and tested and break like new systems (and old ones) do.
---
I agree, I wouldn‚Äôt mind them lowering it a bit, at least in earlier patches. Maybe by phase 5-6 go back to 50 because people can farm much faster by then.
---
23/27/0 is awesome for healing, and damage. Divine Spirit+Spiritual guidance gives an absurd amount of spirit, and spellpower. https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/BD_DIxAEfND8cAA
---
And there is 5 points left over to respec into spirit tap for farming.
---
I always thought that the Warcraft movie came out at an awful time. It could have been such a good tool to advertise. The story of the Warcraft movie had barely anything to do with what was concurrently happening in Warcraft at the time. They were like half way through WoD I think... only Guldan and Thrall would have been recognizable names.
---
I bring that up to say if they had released the Warcraft movie around the beginning of August it would have been AMAZING advertising for the launch of Classic. 
---
Anyways, to your question. I think it's too early on to have any major advertising going. It's still 3 months away with Beta just barely being released. I think in the month and especially two weeks leading up to release we'll see a ton of advertising. I could DEFINITELY seeing them bringing back the old advertisements like with Ozzy Osbourne and stuff lol!
---
&gt;There are less good hunters about, as players can get lazy who play them.
---
SO much this, I've mained a hunter before and it made me worse at every other class.
---
Its not optimal but its alright. Ive done and it works just fine. Tryhards wont do it but i like it.
---
Yeah man, you'll just have to take the good with the bad. And I for one think the bad makes the good that much better. 
---
I wish you the best and remember, have fun.
---
One argument against this is that no guild bank encourages more player-to-player interactions, as you can't simply put something in the guild bank. If you need something, you're going to have to trade someone or get it sent to you personally.
---
INTJ Hunter here too!
---
If you don't mind me asking for pvp, what do you consider as S tier?
---
I like the Warlock who didn't even have his epic Dreadsteed yet.
---
yea i was thinking popping out and back into shadowform when needed.
---
Thanks for the reply
---
&gt; Things hit hard in Classic. Very hard(compared to current content wow) and you won't be hitting them NEARLY as hard.
---
No, they really don't. They hit so soft that most people thought it was a bug until Blizzard shut them up.
---
Hit 60, get MC on farm, begin leveling my twink
---
Yes...Mobs would definitely snap/slide back when you and the mob were too tight but sometimes it would reposition behind you instead of moving back.
---
There was also the bug where mobs would teleport on top of you while they were approaching and wouldn't properly update til they reached you and started attacking.  If you rooted them or something it would only temporarily fix it...may have been fixed before 1.12
---
I hope they release TBC servers and allow a free transfer.
---
You wont even need a lot of practice. Hunters straight up smash everyone until people start getting geared at 60. Running into a hunter in the world is a spooky time
---
There will be addons for this
---
Oh.... I thought the guy above just made it up himself...
---
Like old systems *did.
---
If your character has the possibility of being placed in a new game world - how do you get there? Phasing.
---
I sit corrected, the previous commands are disabled and replaced with a slider which is like the old distance and way better than retail.
---
&gt; /script console=SetCVar("cameraDistanceMax", 50)
---
&gt; /console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 5
---
Now a slider.
---
You said it yourself. Servers were smaller, you knew everyone that mattered. If someone ninjalooted once, everyone would know about it. There's a difference between guildless Randomjackbob opening up a random raidgroup or someone from a reputable guild.
---
There were pugs for raids in Vanilla, there will be even more in Classic.
---
This exactly. I'm an offtank on a pserver, but I made myself a nightfall. I will volunteer for nightfall duty on every boss/trash pack where I am not especially needed. On multi target fights, I will tank skull, and then nightfall all remaining mobs in the kill order. Having a dedicated enhance shaman is just a wasted raid spot.
---
Yes you can lol you just have to know how.
---
Have you had a bad day? Would you like a cuddle?
---
meanwhile my priest, who isn't even considered a good lvl'Er, on beta is wanding stuff to death and have about 3 second of downtime between mob ( the time required to cast heal)...
---
&gt; the player base innately ruins whatever they are given by complaining about their own special interests. It's an inevitability.
---
Wait until you figure out this is how the real world also works...
---
It‚Äôs not about watering down or homogenizing the classes my dude, it‚Äôs literally just allowing classes to be able to perform in their roles come endgame.
---
You all need to clam it.
---
&gt;Capping at 5 makes sure people aren‚Äôt wandering off too far
---
PepeLaugh
---
I personally would not want an increase in level cap. I am all for new content but keep the level cap at 60.  New gear is the only thing that needs to be introduced. Perhaps we get an arcane area and need arcane resist gear. We can work with what we are given.  Or maybe if you want new gear that changes up gameplay you can add a piece of gear that changes it gives you a new usable ability.  Ex Talisman of the crusader, USE: perform Crusader Strike 6 sec cool down.  (For paladins) 
---
We don't need to change the level cap or change talents,  what is there is already great.
---
Tryhard spotted
---
I would love too. I hope they give me the option
---
Goblin Bomb Dispenser and Goblin Dragon Gun are the only 2 BoP Goblin things. Death Ray and Chicken (Gnomish BoP things) are better in the vast majority of situations IMO.
---
&gt; Your absolutely wrong dead zone kiting was a thing
---
He never said it wasn't.  He said the minimum range isn't 8 yards, it's dynamic based on your race and the race you are fighting.  I can neither confirm or deny this is correct.  But he definitely isn't saying deadzone kiting wasn't a thing.
---
Extra weapon skill is not irrelevant at 60. I don‚Äôt know the exact math on the subject but I believe that your glancing blows are affected by having a higher weapon skill than 300 because boss mobs are higher than level 60. Someone who actually knows what they are talking about might be able to further clarify though.
---
Edit: I just realised you were talking about other players being capped at 60 therefore weapon skill above 300 doesn‚Äôt matter. Apologies!
---
Most BFA players can‚Äôt participate in high level + because they have to grind rating in an add on similar to gearscore to get into PuGs. Also nobody really cares about high level + with whatever combination of goofy affixes and the mobs going up on a hp/damage slider. Blizzard flirting with making + an esport isn‚Äôt going to make it actually happen, and most players just do 1 of whatever level is required  to cap their weekly loot box or buy a carry. 
---
The whole system misses the point anyway, and so do you. Retail is no longer an MMORPG, and MMORPGs historically weren‚Äôt skill intensive games. Making them more skill intensive to try to make the content meaningful or interesting doesn‚Äôt work except in very specific instances. Skill oriented gamers can go play a Japanese fighting game or an RTS or even a MOBA to showcase their skill. Your example is really just an example of how lost this game has become and how it lacks any true identity or appeal.
---
We were like how in the hell back then too :-)
---
These comments are misinformation. The client is based on 8.0 so space and requirements are similar to legion. It should be around 20 gigs and need a mediocre build by today's standards to run at 60fps on medium settings.
---
That's not a revelation dude.
---
Spot on. I just finished Rise of the Horde and my god is the writing elementary. You still get the story and the lore and all which is great, but it is written at a 4th grade level so it gets frustrating.
---
Yep, this is the reason I lost interest on raids.... it feels so pointless.
---
If I remember correctly it's unlocked with the quest, but I didn't during BC so I'm not 100%.
---
OSRS is exactly what they should be aiming to achieve. They have done it almost perfectly.
---
because if you have 1K+ viewers your still a nobody unless you get maslac's approval,
---
But in all seriousness Iv been watching MoO\_Uk this morning do just this and competing with 3-4 others doing exactly the same.
---
A time reference. WoW came out 2004. The Mr T commercials came out in 2010. 
---
There's definitely an audience to reach through television. I hope they do. Maybe later on if they need subs? Right now they're already expecting a large amount of users coming in. 
---
This has been spoken before in this sub if you go looking for other post. Someone else mentioned that it's bad to have an extreme number at the start. It's better to let it gradually get stronger. 
---
If there is an overflow of first time players they might get frustrated not being able to complete things because theres so many. Let them know about it a few months after release.
---
Edit: sorry I think it was 2007.
---
Europeans finally experiencing the bullshittery NA has been dealing with for 8 years on pservers
---
I am happy to say I received the same joy on the stress test, and now we can have a couple level 10s this time.  I dont expect you to agree but the values seem correct to me and they have been verified by Blizz.  After 5 you should see a change.
---
Nock is the real hero here
---
I've a crackpot theory that only players who were either at Blizzcon or bought the Virtual Ticket were invited to the level 30 beta, if anyone in beta without having done either can disprove me I welcome it.
---
That‚Äôs absolutely fair then. I used to get so happy when I was halfway through a run to an entrance and that summon button would appear.

90 days is such a long time... It feels close but 90 days sounds like forever to wait.

&gt;'Balance' is murky, hard to define state that no one will ever agree is reached.
---
Yeah, agree. Of course it is.
---
But my point is, homogenizing all the classes is not the only way how to try to achieve it. I don't know if you're familiar with Dota2, but there IceFrog usually "balances" heroes to push their core strengths which define them, not "fixing" their weaknesses to give them for example escape move that everybody has. Amd it works amazingly, as he is adored for his balance and rightly so.
---
&gt; You say you're satisfied with TBC balance
---
No, not exactly. TBC is just example, that it "is possible". Of course TBC balance is not perfect (see your first point) but is certainly *better*. So the balance can be improved, without compromising class identity and uniqueness.
---
&gt; certain they know how to design a better game
---
I am not, not at all. That's why I want to leave it up to professional designers to do it.
---
But of course I'm not suggesting it now for the Classic release, where the main point is to restore original game as it was. But down the line, if we get development further in the "Classic" philosophy (new old raids, maybe horizontal progression, idk) then why not. I would not be afraid of class balance if the core values remain intact (class identity, uniqueness, RPG elements, class fantasy etc.).
---
Went and upgraded my whole set up so I can efficiently stream, and I'm also saving for a new GPU come August. My workouts and sleep have been on point and I've been spending a lot of time with the old lady in lieu  of August 27th. I'm ready for Classic!!!

Dear god yes this. Not only would it be awesome for raiding, it'd be awesome for class balance. As much as people bitch about the talents, the real problem with the variety of specs is that raid mechanics don't get hybrids any chance to shine. 99% of raiding is tank and spank where sustained dps is the order of the day. Modern WoW mixes things up by thinking about fights based around tanking multiple mobs in different phases, cleave damage, are damage, scenarios where you need to burst hard, etc.
---
Gnomish bop things can be used in any path. 
---
Goblin things are more consumable
---
So try harders should start with gnomish and switch to goblin
---
Oh....and what happens after 60?
---
I get that Eve is the best thing since sliced bread, my question to the parent commenter was how a "theme park MMO" can emulate some of that horizontal progression without losing the carrot-on-a-stick style that all but defines the genre.
---
I agree, hence the "More Aggressive" comment. Tv is like a float ad that is kinda meh, but if they hit the youtube adds and stream adds, that would be a lot more effective imo.
---
Have fun, dont burn out
---
I have to remember, this is not retail the game starts at level 1 not at 60 so there is no huge hurry, im not a hard core raider anyway
---
INTJ Horde rogue!
---
This is a really cool survey you're putting together, I can't wait to see the results!

it was definitely a learning experience... Plus I got to see some cool zones like Searing Gorge that I wouldn't visit again until I had gained 40 levels.

How about any evidence that there is anything off rather than requiring "undeniable" evidence that it's correct before anything is shown to be off?
---
I doubt Classic gets a lot of advertising.  The people who are interested in playing likely know about it.  It's a niche market, it's not something that they're going to market to new players. Blizzard is, IMO, not going to want new players to experience Classic as their first experience with WoW. 
---
Considering that WoW Classic isn't exactly going to be a channel for big revenue, I highly doubt we see a big marketing campaign for it. 
---
And I know there are those folks who are saying "WTF are you saying!  WoW Classic will be MASSIVE! 5 Million subs!  It'll rake in the dollars!" But no, it won't.  It will have it's playerbase, but WoW Classic isn't going to be a big revenue generator considering they're giving Classic to anyone with a current subscription. 
---
The costs to get WoW Classic running combined with the cost to keep it running, when you compare it to the number of people who will re-sub to WoW JUST for Classic, will keep Classic from being a big revenue generator. 
---
IMO, the execs of Blizzard see Classic as a good will gesture to the fanbase while also seeing a potential channel to pull old WoW gamers in with the hopes that they will give retail WoW a go given that they already have a subscription.
---
Oh I have serious alt issues as well
---
I fully expect to have a bunch of 40s and 30s lol
---
Thanks. Locked on PvP is cool. I was unsure, I could have sworn I tried to make a cross faction on a PVE server and it wouldn't let me. But that was a long time ago.
---
Get some new friends.
---
&gt;  I paid for epic flying on 6 characters during vanilla by selling mats. "
---
No you did not. Bc=/=vanilla

It really wouldnt take that long to be semi fluent.  Many gamers learn English this way.  Never said op had to.  Just it could be an opportunity to learn should they wish.
---
Edit: This is how i picked up alot of french.  Got put in the french kid platoon when i was a cadet back in the day.  Just made the best of a shit situation
---
On the accurate pservers (the most popular ones aren't particularly accurate), the values are very close. Things such as mob damage can be figured out with 100% accuracy with old video evidence. The only guesswork was really just certain mob mechanics and drop rates, since there is no hard data behind this. As far as mob HP, armor, and damage values go though, this is very easily mathed out.
---
Some mechanics and drop rates will differ somewhat in Classic, since this was definitely guesswork.
---
Don't listen to these people dude. They're cray cray
---
On the other hand.
---
If you actually DO reach out and speak to another player. Community still exists.
---
Any and every community requires input. 
---
Vanilla will not magically instantiate a group of chums and fellow adventurers.
---
Sub Rogue, Shadow Priest, and Frost Mage. Combine really good players and really good gear, and I feel like those three are just top notch for PvP. I feel like other classes can be a B or A tier, but those three have always felt strong to me both on the receiving end and dealing end. This is what I remember, from back in the vanilla days, at least.
---
You would be surprised how many players are opposed to what you are proposing. They want frozen wow classic servers forever.
---
Which I also want, at least for like 1-2 years, but would I want to continue to experience a new WoW with a vanilla-esque design philosophy? Man.. yes I would..
---
I think it would be possible to do so, but not the way they did it.  The problem is that if they wanted to manage the chaos, they should have first embraced it.  Instead, they tried to eliminate it.
---
As an example, let's say there's a dungeon mechanic that is easier for some classes.  A boss may be easy for Mages because there's a lot of adds that need to be AoE'd down, but hard for Rogues because they are a single target class.
---
**Blizzard's Solution**:  Make it so Rogues can do AoE damage!
---
**My Solution:**  Have this type of boss drop a BIS rogue piece.  (The worse the fight is for rogues, the more important the slot of the bigger the delta between this piece and the 2nd-BiS).
---
Now you bring Mages to kill it, but you bring Rogues to gear them.  And it's sadistic as a developer, because it makes what's best for the guild be what's worst for the dungeon run.
---
There‚Äôs an addon that does this on private servers so should be a classic version available too on release
---
Except classes are absolutely homogenized in retail. Whether you can balance and not homogenize them is a different discussion that I dont have as clear cut an opinion on.
---
Yeah before the scary 40-50 range drought. *Nam flashbacks*
---
i cant answer all your questions but i do know that for pvp engineering is THE best profession you can take because  they can use the stun bombs and other little things they make.
---
for easy money you can take up gathering, like mining which will also come in handy for engineering. Besides gathering everyone will need enchants and flasks and potions etc so enchanting and alchemy will earn you some good coin aswel.
---
If you play warlock you could craft some epics later on that can be helpful.
---
&gt; Also, how hard is it to play both pve and pvp on one character in vanilla? Is it hard to respec? Costly? Is there any class/build that can do both easily? 
---
Some classes can do both but its not like retail where every spec has to be viable in both pve and pvp.
---
for example priests are arguably the best healers in classic but shadow is mostly useless in pve but a master in pvp.
---
most specs have minor differences in talents when you want to min max but if you just want some casual fun then you can go hybrid and still do pretty well
---
I think hunters are very strong in pvp. Early on in patches their damage and pet damage is very strong and that alone can carry them.
---
As later patches come, yes their damage falls off comparatively however hunters with a proper pvp spec and some points in survival get very tanky. And they have so much utility that a long drawn out fight favors them heavily. 
---
Melee classes are a breeze for good hunters. Frost mages are a toss up. Only warlocks really give you trouble, they are pretty much a direct counter. However, a tanky hunter can viper sting down most casters and turn it into a grindy fight even vs warlocks. 
---
And if you‚Äôre able to start a fight at max range as a hunter, it‚Äôs pretty much an auto win, skill level being equal.
---
Hey he got a shield.   
---
I had the privilege to try and heal a stockade for a warrior wearing a 2h axe who didn‚Äôt understand why we kept wiping. Yelling at me for not healing him enough.  Claiming his tps was good.  I said yes but not your armour and evasion.
---
The really big question here is whether or not to balance classes. TBC brought a lot of changes and it will fundamentally change the 1-60 experience. Part of what keeps MMOs going is new content and changes to classes but I can see a hard split here in the community.
---
Correct. Did it in Vanilla. Didn't even have to spend all the money, got another lock who had done it to come with me.
---
Because it costs lots of money to respec and its boring to grind mobs for gold, mats, professions in a tank spec. So if you go tank, you need a second character for farming or you need a good guild which will support your repairs, flasks, food.
---
I agree. Advertise like crazy all over social media, YT, Twitch and others. But radio, tv or news ads aren‚Äôt worth it imo.
---
Nope, every guild needs 4-5 Tanks. Maybe one super geared main tank, but to complete MC / BWL you will need multiple good tanks.
---
I remember that Nock was a nelf hunter, but far from the most hated one on the server, that honor went to Longarms also featured here. His K/D isn't as nice but I remember everyone always complaining about him, I guess mostly because he was crazy geared and PVP'd seemingly around the clock.
---
I don‚Äôt think dumping 3k people all at starting zones really gave them any actually useful data. It was more for server load testing.
---
Agree 100% with the Movie idea. 
---
I hope the bring back the classics, that would be outstanding! I think you are also correct with the last few weeks being hammer time for WoW classic adds.
---
Honestly I thought 1 hemo rogue per raid was something most top guilds aimed to have. Back in vanilla that was my role, although I wasn't in the tip top raid guild.
---
Yeah, and no-one can make those bags yet. If they up the beta cap to 60 no-one's gonna give much of a shit about 12 slotters.
---
Your a fully geared mythic player, linking heroic rankings Like they matter. Let‚Äôs look at your mythic rankings
---
Oh.
---
People who are actually good, rank well on fights that last longer than 2 minutes. But if out damaging people who are 20ilvl below you makes you feel superior, good for you my dude
---
&gt; the problem isnt that it CAN be blazed through its that end game dungeons encourage it
---
You do know one of the big attractions of private server raiding in 2018/2019 is speed running raids....right?
---
&gt; still idk why blizz went the way of thinking faster speed= more difficulty
---
Mythic+ isn't actually designed in a way where you need to go faster for more leaderboard points. Higher key = more points, when something has say 660% more hp and damage than the base dungeon you are going to need to find different ways to pull that same content and yeah - part of that is going to be pulling 2 or even 3 packs into each other if the affixes permit.
---
Anyone who thinks there won't be some form of tracker for Classic is insane. Whether we are talking about raid speed clears (as we have clearly seen on private servers), dungeons, or leveling there is going to be a leaderboard somewhere because there is clearly a desire for competition which is a good thing. Just because you don't want to clear Naxx in an hour or if you want to do a +26 key on BFA it isn't a bad thing.
---
Me and my friend are looking for a raiding guild come classic. I intend to MT a Tauren Warrior and my friend/pocket healer is playing a priest. NA region, normal or pvp is fine, Horde. Availability is Sunday-Thursday evenings 5-11 PST. PM me if you are recruiting and need a main tank and healer.
---
To be honest the rotation pretty much is just aim shot auto shot and multi shot and you run out of mana faster than mage. It‚Äôs actually quite tedious and the worst part of hunter experience. Also don‚Äôt plan on keeping pet in raids. Other than that yes very nice class.
---
Why would you play the same class? Doesn't that completely defeat the purpose of playing to each others strengths? You will also get a lot less gear if you have to share drops with your partner.
---
If they want to go OSRS mode, they should let anyone with an character over level 30 in classic wow vote on the future. Ala Jagex community polls and only accept results that have a large majority.
---
But leave this for at least 1-2 years from release of Classic, so people get their fill of classic.
---
He doesn‚Äôt mind the hate - he actually seems invigorated by it. So maybe that should be a signal to stop a bit.
---
I dont want to bring you down but isn't the only reason you got top kills is because you were in the BG the longest? Thatn second dude has way less deads and almost equal te kills.
---
Still it looks good to see your name on top, atleast you did your part. To bad it was a lose.
---
It depends of the private server of course, there are some with bonus xp rates and others with Blizz like xp. I played on a Blizz like server up to 54 til beta came out, and I can say that the pacing felt very much the same as it does in beta.
---
Eek!
---
Enjoy your 5 chances at MCP per hour I guess. 
---
Seems completely unsustainable if there is no instance reset exploit.
---
On-hit items to work in cat form, won‚Äôt happen but a Dudu can dream
---
Druid + rogue could be a good combo.
---
Youre still competitive but you gotta work for it a bit more. People arent just dead after your opener so you gotta be a bit tighter on your kiting, deadzoning and situational spells. Your choice of pet will matter more too as some pets are better than others at endgame
---
I did ZG at level 70 with a group of ~10 people just to try to get the mounts. The Zulian Tiger dropped and I lost the roll. RIP never forget.
---
Exactly, hard values such as boss armor, hp, and damage can easily be calculated from old video evidence with 100% accuracy. 
---
Some things like drop rates and more nebulous boss mechanics do have some guesswork behind them though.
---
As long as he isn't a bad drunk that beats up his bitch, then it's cool.
---
there are occasionally difficult quest mobs to kill that reward xp on the order of 10x what a grindable mob rewards. these have typically required a health potion and i've survived with \~10% hp. warriors are a bit of an exception though, and i think i have a better way of dealing with that problem.
---
i'll likely do a run to 30 without leveling cooking just to see, but i have a hard time seeing how it would be faster. my guess is that cooking-less might \*possibly\* be faster but more expensive, but that remains to be seen. all of the vanilla/classic warrior guides have recommended leveling first aid and cooking, but then again, they also have shitty talent recommendations if you're trying to level quickly, so maybe they're wrong about food and stacking spirit.
---
LFR and Dungeon Finder!
---
just kidding.
---
Honestly, as many have pointed out, transmog really hurts nothing and people love it. I'd have no issue with that.
---
for me, honestly and it's not possible, but it'd be some of the dungeons that I enjoyed. It wouldn't work from a lore perspective but over the years, i've loved some of the dungeon designs. 
---
You'll get shot apart for the dual spec idea in your op, but part of the classic idea is that our decisions matter and have some sort of cons. Being able to switch specs on the fly makes some classes way to easy. i am on the ship of zero cost respecs in a major city though as a fair compromise.
---
Thank you both for your answers! Guess I'll be stuck with my 60% then :P
---
No! Absolutely DO NOT use that item in elewyn forest! It works on bosses. What terrible advice
---
Every single time I actually run the numbers on a comparison it just turns out to be people not understanding complex topics like damage mitigation from armor and... ok, it's been damage mitigation from armor every single time. I'm confident it's the case here as well, but I'm not going to sit through a 13-minute video so I'll be analyzing /u/MwHighlander's [comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btv8b3/cstrikebbaron_thoughts_on_elite_damage/ep332ao/) instead.
---
Swapblaster. Its the best item ever created.
---
Hi, /u/Noteorgen
---
Warlocks don't get to use corruption with 16 debuffs.  Too many other higher prop debuffs.
---
No, part of the fun was handing out hearthstones! Gosh
---
&gt;	alt-right buzzwords
---
Please don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre talking about Soy
---
I definitely liked the concept of the time walking dungeons. I think it fell far short of what it should have been though.
---
You understand pulling, kiting, can track misses/parries/etc innately, you understand what gear to get, you understand that you actually need to train things actively, first aid, cooking, etc etc.
---
Trust me. it is not only a possibility, it is demonstrable fact. The numbers are accurate. The devs have provided indisputable evidence. They have a version of vanilla running on the old code with the old everything hooked up. The numbers are identical, and are even the same compared to video footage. 
---
You don't remember it the same way because you can't account for how much you (and everyone else) sucked when they first played. Things you don't even realize you didn't know back then are innate things to you now.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. The Twitch culture is extremely toxic, and it tarnishes everything it touches.
---
Go hard
---
I premade farmed for Warlord in WSG in Vanilla, and even I can't remember that they had portals beside their camps.
---
I don't have the numbers for how big of a time difference it makes obviously, and I would reckon it depends heavily on the guild because of factors like deaths due to less dps/tanky/heal, and how much trash is skipped. But another factor to remember is that raid time is special time. It's those few hours a week that the entire guild can come online and do stuff that requires the entire guild. I value that time and want to do as much as possible with it. Obviously there's limits to how much you can do, especially like you said, with only MC/ony out.
---
Aoe looting and auto loot only things I would accept as changes. Having to reposition your camera and surgically move your cursor for over a minute just to finally loot that 1 mob in a pile of corpses sucks.
---
Yea - in particular, for Schematic: Arcanite Dragonling :D
---
Untrue, name them, you can‚Äôt as there are not 16 higher priority raid debuffs.
---
I really don't like warrior tanks for anything except raiding and even there I prefer ferals if possible. Warrior tanks can only do one thing; tank. A druid or paladin can do all three roles in 5-mans and they can ress, buff, innervate etc.
---
Are we going with the patch that has "cheap" skill and expensive mounts?
---
Don't know if anyone has said this, but could actually do Saitama's one punch man, training for 100 days,. You are 19 days late but, work your way up to 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, and a 10k-run. Everyday. And by the end you will be ripped, and bald.
---
&gt; Well actually cross realm anything rly
---
So Vanilla killed retail because that is when cross realm began. 
---
WoW is dead everyone, has been dead for 14 years - let's pack it up, we're done here.
---
1. Create a dwarf rogue. 
---
2. Lockpick the door of Naxx and bend the knee to Kel‚Äôthuzad  
---
3. Become his hand. Consult him to MC Allen Brack once again (just before phase 6), so that he announces new content that trivialises Naxx too soon. This way no-one will kill my lord again
---
4. Quit WOW
---
I mean yes, but I was probably pretty chuffed at the time anyway :p
---
I'll pay double, i still need to level my smithing!
---
I bought the first one that ever came up for sale on N*st for 100g. These useful mid-level uniques tend to be fairly cheap early on because someone's bound to find it around the level where they want gold for a mount more than they want to wait around for a better offer. After that, it seems to have settled in the region of 200-250 on the servers I've played. A [nearly identical weapon](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18531) becomes available in Dire Maul which prevents the staff from getting too expensive, and feral tank is one of the least played specs in vanilla so the demand isn't very high, and the item is low enough level to drop from absolutely anything that gets farmed for gold at level 60 so it's not real rare compared to things like Hand of Edward which can only drop from level 58+ mobs or something like that.
---
If you‚Äôre playing wow for the first time I‚Äôd especially advise you to ignore trying to get ‚Äúgood‚Äù leveling times, it won‚Äôt give you any extra enjoyment.
---
The in game calandar for organising events and raids, my guilds planning to use the one on retail to record classic events to keep track but it would be nice to have it in classic it's self.
---
"Y U do dis?" -Dog probably.
---
* Intended region (NA/EU) : NA
---
* Intended server type (Nomal, PvP, RP, RP-PvP) ; would prefer normal - will play any
---
* Intended faction : want to go horde. Thinking Priest / Druid / Warlock
---
* Intended raid/play times (with timezone) : Pretty open - Sund-Saturday. Work 8-5 but pretty free to make a schedule. CST
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild (Raiding, PvP, RP, Social experience, etc) Wanting to enjoy Classic WoW again, im not the biggest PvP'er but the PVE side of the game is my jam
---
* Any pertinent rules. Im 28 so i'd prefer a group my age. I just want a group of people who are ready to enjoy a different grind and have fun!
---
* A preferred form of contact (PM, Discord link, website application) Just DM if interested.   
---
I appreciate anyone who takes the time. Most of my high school buddies are probably not going to play this time around.
---
i THINK .. personally.. that you dont have a clue what you are talking about, and you need to just live with the fact you arent getting what you want, and that is changes
---
One of my most memorable experiences was discovering that BWL had the raid lockout tied directly to Razorgore.
---
You could cheese it by MCing him at the perfect time with a rogue and vanishing. It would make it so Razorgore doesn‚Äôt regenerate his health back in the second phase.
---
30 mains / 10 alts
---
Take him to 10%, MC, portal 30 mains to IF, drop group, kill Razorgore with 10 alts, reinvite mains, full the 10 additional spots with mains, full clear with no lockout.
---
This was during peak BWL, While only us + a handful of other guilds on Laughing Skull were capable of full clearing BWL.
---
We full cleared BWL 3 times in one night on our mains. Let‚Äôs just say I got fucking decked out and no one got banned.
---
We then realized this design was applied to all raids. ZG, MC. They fixed it by AQ40.
---
14 years later I still remember it perfectly.
---
I remember being on Tichondrius server‚Äôs first MC raid. We wiped for hours on the 2 entrance giants before giving up. Everyone was in greens/blues.
---
Need it for Mend Pet.
---
Hard cost is 406 + some trade skill created materials. Might add 2-300g in materials.
---
35 Black Dragonscales   
---
25 Dark Iron Ore   
---
6 Large Brilliant Shards   
---
10 Elixirs of Shadow Power   
---
3 Arcanite Bars   
---
406 Gold  
---
Depending on tradeskills/guild you could get it for 406g lol. Still, usually cheaper.
---
I got lucky. The mount dropped for me DAYS before Cata dropped. I was so stoked. It was the only mount I really wanted.
---
I sorta disagree, people have been referring to WoW as the gold standard of mmorpg gaming for so long that the name is at the top of everyone's head. Kids ages 10 know about WoW and I think if they have it prepped and setup, there could be a whole nother round of WoW bigger then it was in the first place. It has had a quite solid community for the past 7-10 years. Most gamers have tried it throughout it's lifecycle.
---
What makes you think that it will not garner a HUGE number of subscriptions? What else is out there that could hold mmorpg gamers attention? The newest expansions of WoW have failed heroically.
---
"And I know there are those folks who are saying "WTF are you saying! WoW Classic will be MASSIVE! 5 Million subs! It'll rake in the dollars!" But no, it won't. It will have it's playerbase, but WoW Classic isn't going to be a big revenue generator considering they're giving Classic to anyone with a current subscription."
---
Did you play classic? Do you have friends that played? I have met dozens of people (Small sample size) that played WoW in our younger years and we all quit ABOUT the same time for very similar reasons. Just in my small sample group. I will have more people playing the same game then I have ever had that I know or consider friends. I would wager a lot that I am not the only one that can say this.
---
Alot of it comes from nostalgia, but the game itself is just really good. You die if you take on more than you can chew. Gold isnt as easy to to come by. Raiding is actually very teamwork focused. It actually feels like a traditional MMO.
---
There's plenty of people who believe in no changes that wants blizzlike progression. Lots of people even said "uhh the no changes move is ruined now that 1.12 talents is confirmed"
---
The idea is simply that:
---
A) Blizzard doesn't have the right mindset to be making changes that are in spirit with classic
---
B) Everyone have different dream versions of classic and they don't overlap much. Some people see guild banks as a good change, some people don't. The only way to satisfy everyone is a compromise that is just no changes at all.
---
Maybe.  My memory is foggy. üòã
---
What time zone? I prefer horde, but can roll alliance if it's the right fit. I'm going mage, rogue, Hunter
---
Before I click on this, is this S8 spoiler or not?
---
Im hoping for Vanilla "directors cut". Instead of proceding to TBC, then wrath and so on, start including stuff that were planned for vanilla such as Northeron, Hyjal, etc patches with further development keeping the vanilla phylosophy in mind.
---
I appreciate the No Changes movement, but after 2 years it will be time to add on new content otherwise the project will die, and I personally dont want the same route ahead as retail.
---
It truly could be that the values are correct. I'm willing to accept that.
---
It has been very enjoyable, even to level 5. I look forward to release and still hold out a little hope for beta access but I'm fine waiting for release too.
---
you are stupid. stfu
---
&gt;Like I said, that's why SW/PI is a spec. It's better to have a sub-par healer than an OOM below the tank DPS  
---
&gt;You're not reading what I'm saying. PI/SW as a healer is viable...
---
Would rather have a sub par dps than a sub par healer, they don't go oom as you say they do maybe you played alli and ddint see how well mana tides work for them, I don't agree with you assment of the class as ive had experiences that contradict what you imply. The debuff slots wont likly fill up with too many corruptions. The more dps the faster the fight, thus less dmg on the raid/tanks, thus less healing to do.
---
Yea this is bad advice for the rogue. Better to go mining engineering for pvp and to have a gathering professions that will make money. Herb alch is a good choice for the warlock too if he can get someone else to make bloodvine down the road.
---
I think Soda and Asmongold have made a secret agreement to stream at different times so they both get max viewers
---
I agree. Although Arms is probably pretty similar DPS to Fury at low gear levels, I would still hate being MS specced in raid. But, its really not going to affect the ability to take down any bosses in MC imo. IDK how bad the pvp spec for rogues would be vs the pve spec.
---
But yea at least for warrior and most other classes you should be able to get away w it in MC/Ony phases. Tanks are kinda screwed though. (You could probably tank in Arms but.... dam sounds awful)
---
&gt;Was just curious if there was any information on this out there
---
Engineering is definitely something I'm leveling on my first char at launch.
---
The utility is insane.
---
You sound like my devoutly baptist 87 year old grandmother. I bet you waited until the legal drinking age to drink, and then didn't anyway because it's bad for you.
---
Live a little.
---
PvE? Warrior, Rogue, Mage, Warlock. Hunters can really shine up until BWL. Then after that they just don't seem to scale well and other classes tend to out DPS them :T Play what you want though, there is a spot for absolutely everyone as some mechanics sometimes require a class specific ability. Personally I recommend playing what's fun and interesting, so you just love playing!
---
Warriors, with the right gear and spec, are generally disgusting with DPS in raids. It's wild.
---
I would argue that transmog hurts immersion. You should look like a work in progress if you are and you should look badass if you're wearing a teir set. Or well... you should look ridiculous if you're wearing some. Nomog makes you care about your gear. In retail I can not tell you the name of a single item I am wearing. This isn't just because of mogging but its part of it. It makes gear feel disposable since you won't look any different with a new upgrade.
---
druids are better 5 man tanks in general IMO. They can‚Äôt stack the absurd survivability to MT late game stuff but their threat generation and ability to chain pull as fast as the healer and DPS can kill makes for fast dungeon clears.
---
they said less servers to not spread out population and then will increase on the fly as player demand is needed
---
No you are just currently worse than others, there's no cheat that's just the harsh reality and something you should accept, because it is okay, it means you have room to grow and improve, and that's one of the best parts about videogames.
---
There‚Äôs no cross realm in classic.
---
Yes, that's the way it worked last time and I would assume it will be the same this time since they haven't said anything different. They'll shut the other beta servers down for the period where they're actually monitoring the stress test server to make sure everyone is on that one. Then once they're done collecting the data they need, they'll start the other beta servers back up.
---
I agree partly. I played rogue and remember the armor penetration stacking! I never was a fan of hard mode though. This decision was justified that everyone should be able to see the raid content. Which lead to lfr ultimately. 
---
The first Arthas kill was epic for me. I yelled my heart out but why would I kill him again for an achievement never got to me.
---
Shamans by a mile.  Totems, chain heal, windfury, frost shock kiting, and being able to steal Hunter gear to give them a taste of their own medicine blow away the competition imo.
---
You couldn't pay me to play a druid though.
---
I'm hoping more will crop up near launch with that as their raid times or perhaps a secondary raid time within aa guild
---
Hi, /u/TheAntiOP
---
Hunters are a high skill cap pvp class. There is a lot of room for mastery.
---
Luckily you dont need much gear to do well as a hunter (hence why they trail off by end of progression--they dont scale well with gear). Double luckily MC/BWL is a 1 night a week venture. And zg/ony reset more often than once a week so easier to find in your spare time. 
---
I imagine MC/ZG/Ony/AQ20 and with time BWL runs will all be puggable.
---
Is it possible to downvote multiple times? You are basically here telling everyone that how they enjoy the Beta is wrong.
---
You're gonna waste more time by lvling professions once you hit 60 than you would working on them as you level
---
You're missing out homie.
---
Gradual is likely right. I could easily see them not advertising a bit, and once it is up and running, they can claim something like, COME JOIN X and relive yata yata yata. I would agree that will be a cleaner way of going about this rather then the absurd influx that mass advertising would cause on their poor servers.
---
People dont want 'change' because the second one thing changes, it leaves a wide open idea that something else will change, so on and so forth.
---
MD ruin makes it a non issue for horde, but you miss out on damage from either SM or Succy sacrifice.
---
saying the project will die is literally retarded when the reason youre playing classic is because it NEVER died, its alive, constnatly on priv servers, and restarted, constantly, and grows a community non stop
---
Warlocks have all this aside from portals lol
---
Does your account have to be subbed to participate?
---
Re-reading Arthas myself. Like others have said, the reading level isn‚Äôt that high, but it does cover a lot of backstory you wouldn‚Äôt find in game and is pretty interesting.
---
As for the others, overall I would say they were really good but that‚Äôs partially because I am a bit biased since it‚Äôs Warcraft. Some are definitely harder to read than others
---
As someone who‚Äôs been twinking since BC, no thanks. Not only was it not in vanilla, it‚Äôs what led to the slow death of twinking in retail
---
I watched a streamer this weekend named Criken.  He and another group of folks were running some challenge and RPing at the same time and it was hilarious/awesome.  The challenge was that they were not allowed to wear anything that someone in the guild did not make (i.e. no drops or quest items), no one in the group could have the same profession, and if you died you had to delete the character and restart from level 1.  Watching them run around and RP with people out questing as hilarious.  Watching them get scared when extra mobs were pulled or running away trying to stay alive was hilarious.  Overall, would recommend it to anyone watching.
---
Got it. Thanks man. 
---
So I. Your humble opinion what's the best pvp class you played?
---
I did/do this for other shit just never rly though abou it for this
---
Nope there was a wave last night
---
Murloc treasure map anyone?
---
&gt; Each of these types of "events" are fun but ultimately are empty experiences and are only to drum up viewers or used as "content".
---
I wouldn't say they are empty, the whole point of playing the game is to have fun so if its a fun thing to do its not empty. Logging in to find a dragon in Stormwind is pretty fun in my book. Plus this sort of stuff used to happen all the time in vanilla before people were doing it for "views".
---
15 years in the Academy, he was like no cadet they'd ever seen.
---
A man so hard his veins bleed ice and when he speaks he never says it twice
---
They call him Officer, his last name is Brady
---
So break the Law and you'll wind up dead
---
Truth and Justice is what he's fighting for
---
Officer Brady is the man, he is the Law
---
They're not specially good in group PvP because they don't have any reliable CC, their Stun is completely random and their Silence is on a 40 second timer. They do not bring some brilliant burst either, as SPriest are not a burst class ; they're good in PvP because of their self-healing and damage mitigation. Mana is also a concern, but so is it for most mana classes anyway.
---
The one thing that can be super good in group PvP is Troll's racial, Hex of Weakness :
---
&gt; Weakens the target enemy, reducing damage caused by 2 and reduces effectiveness of healing spells by 20% for 2 minutes. 
---
Very practical, especially since you can just spam the rank 1 for the healing malus which costs close to no mana. Then again, non-shadow troll priests have it too, but an SPriest having such spell is definitely a plus.
---
WPvP, BGs, duels, organized PvP, ganking, level 60, pre-60?
---
I‚Äôm a member of ‚ÄúNo changes that alters the gameplay, depth, and feel‚Äù club. One of the original devs Mark Kern has said that they should have a list of pillars that made a Vanilla what we loved, and anything that is added or changed MUST strictly adhere to those pillars. And for those that want content frozen servers forever, let them have them so they can be happy.
---
All day, all night.
---
On horde, you are correct because of windfury. For the alliance however, bear TPS has a distinct advantage with full pummeler uptime.
---
Man the old AV was top shit. And recognising old names is what really made that game special. Community was top notch back then.
---
I would argue that by making the design decisions they did they already gave the middle finger to their player base but to each his own
---
Just buy the mount, it might be "more expensive", but it also takes a lot less effort and you'll be able to get it sooner.
---
My man, try ranking without staying up to cleave on Rasta, try ranking on Jaina when you ice block siegebreaker in phase 3.
---
My point wasn‚Äôt even that I was good, I just said I do ok for raid logging and one mythic 10 a week...
---
And I just linked what I had in my history, feel free to go back to other mythic tiers, this is probably by far my worst one.
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to prove anything other than I don‚Äôt use icyveins, not sure why you think I was bragging.
---
&gt;I keep seeing everyone mention the debuff things as a means to discourage people from playing what they want and having fun.
---
I see it from both sides. On the one hand (and I know that you prefaced with that this comment wasn't an attack on me, which I do recognize and appreciate, btw) I do believe that people should be allowed to play what they want and I by all means encourage that. I didn't mean to come off as discouraging, but rather convey a warning because I've seen people talk about the debuff limit in this sub and got flack for it when I played it for a stint in Vanilla. 
---
All this aside tho I wasn't able to pull off a good rotation while I played Hemo in PvE, my damage dropped SIGNIFICANTLY from when I played daggers/swords. I did tear it up in PvP tho.
---
"No Changes" is an easy refrain for stupid people to cling to and think that they are holding a fully fledged and developed perspective.
---
You don't like it, therefore it's arbitrary and no one ever thought about it? You underestimate the vanilla wow designers.
---
Consider this: I would prefer if the respec cap were EVEN HIGHER to make it impossible for tryhards to be in an optimal spec for all content at all times. This goes against a core and intended RPG element of the game. Respeccing should be a rare, unusual thing you do. Not a weekly occurrence.
---
You can even go burst focused with ruin.  Soul fire -&gt; immolate -&gt; conflagration is good for pvp.
---
This sounds like what I'm looking for. Do you plan on doing open world raids, small and large? I'm primarily looking to bring back the small town skirmishes we used to have in South shore, Elwyn forest, etc.
---
Im not pretending vanilla is perfect. Im glad its how it is and that the "flaws" of the game allows me to play the way I want it.
---
I wouldn't throw it out, I was personally never in a guild that did it tho.
---
"You think you do, but you dont"
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty excited to play a ranged only warrior. I will only shoot my bow. If anyone complains or links damage meters then they are just an elitist jerk and they are ruining classic!
---
no world firsts in beta
---
games not finished until release
---
Blizzard has confirmed there will be cross realm in Classic.
---
I didn't you you could have 3 professions.
---
This wasn‚Äôt a thing. Hopefully he reported it as a bug. Needs to be changed.
---
Just playing the game. No plans.
---
I'm excited as anybody for Classic but the thought of doing Westfall again makes me sick.
---
I am playing vanilla right now
---
No you overestimate them. You glorify them.
---
Yes.  It fixes the problem of Rogues not having a heal, and becomes much more desireable for a group (maybe even more than dual druid).
---
According to my next few screenshots we cleared BWL for our first time the following week
---
Something tells me you dont know how to farm gold
---
Aight, my mistake, you can make magweaves. Is this method of getting mageweave faster than just farming it from mobs though?
---
I was on horde but dont recognize the guild name.
---
You cant have the cake and eat it unless you are willing to pay the cost in loss of pvp strength or gold. If you use the same logic elsewhere you'll end up with LFG, while I know that is now what you are arguing for I think its proven that this kind of logic is not healthy when applied to a RPG. The same thing can be said about the opposite for sure where the system punish you too hard for your choices in several areas (higher respec cost or even permanent talents), I've heard that a too punishing system is one of several reasons for wildstar not taking of as planned.
---
In any case it will always run into the breaking line of who decides what the respec cost should be? If the cost is lowered to 25 why not to 10 gold? Even trying to go down that road I think we should hope for wow 2 instead of taking chances with ruining the system that we know works, as in complete new servers where you can create entirely separate characters if you want to try out a expanded wow classic or even tbc or wrath.
---
I hope the tbc people get their expansion aswell as the ones who never wants a single change to classic wow, I think there is enough of a following for a healthy population for most early wow iterations.  
---
Edit; I'll add that they have stated they are open to developing new content for classic if enough people wants it.
---
no u
---
Personally I can't wait to do 0 quests in Barrens and only level in WC as a healer until I outlevel it lol.
---
The group I played with decided to all make druids and we did chain pulls in dungeons. Whenever the healer got low, we switched roles. It was a ton of fun just to mess around and enjoy a different style of play than we were used to. Most of my fun memories were mainly just sitting in vent with my high school buddies talking shit, but the 5 man druid lvling and dungeons were pretty fun
---
&gt;  It sucks because no one knew it back in Vanilla 
---
&gt; We all did just fine in vanilla without knowing what we know now.
---
???? Regardless of the rest of your argument, the debuff limit was absolutely acknowledged and a concern back in vanilla - even in casual guilds.
---
Yeah I wish new content was an option, kinda like if you don't like a specific 20-30 zone, you have one or two other options.
---
It might mean having level caps go up by just 1 or 2 every few months, as some content gets moved up or added to the top.  Scholomance might start out at 60 but then end up scaled for 63, for example.
---
I lazily looked over comments, you should add the Tidal Charm trinket from the Rare Mob in Arathi. That stun was entirely OP.  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1404/tidal-charm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1404/tidal-charm)
---
I am not a mogger, i just never got into it. I just don't have an issue with it being in classic. if it's there fine, if not, it doesn't really affect me. I can see your point though.
---
And i totally get that. My positioning needs improvement but  its just hard the literal second I throw up a rejuvenation i get rushed by 3 warriors, 2 hunter pets and a barrage of Arcane missiles because to them a GIANT RED CROSS shows up that they can click on.  I guess i was just more curious about how prevalent this add on is, does it border on the necessary to PVP or is it just a QoL thing.
---
Yeah I have no idea what happened to autocorrect there lol
---
 Didn't know about the nefarion head buff, ty !
---
&gt;In current level 120 retail wow, as you  level up, you don't really need potions and buff food for anything. From  1 until you hit 120 you can basically pull large packs of mobs, burn  them down with ease, and move on to the next pack.  
---
&gt;That  is NOT the case in Classic! You will (if solo) most likely be only  pulling one mob at a time, at least until you start getting more skills  and talent points(eventually you might be able to handle 2-3 even 4 mobs  if you're strong enough,) but most people will be killing mobs 1-2 at a  time.
---
Just wondering why this belief is still around tbh... Since 8.0 things are significantly harder than they used to. You can still easely solo mobs but i'm currently leveling an Enh Sham and outside of my earth elemental (5min cd, he has an AOE taunt) i just can't deal with 6 or more mobs.  Still easier than classic but nowhere as braindead as it used to be.
---
DW tanks barely even give a second thought to defense cap. All that matters is threat, and HP pool. You stack 9 hit minimum, stamina, crit, and AP/STR. The goal is to have a large enough health pool when fully buffed to make being one-shot by a boss impossible. Once you have enough HP to be insta-gib immune, it is then up to the healers to keep the tank alive.
---
This works on 90% of bosses, but is not viable on a certain few. Such as Broodlord Lashlayer, Chromaggus, Lord Kri, and Emperor Vek'nilash.
---
Def rating is a nice bonus if you happen to have some, but I place nearly zero value on it when weighing pieces of gear against each other.
---
And yet what people don't realize about the private servers is that they get patched as well.  A lot of them include non-vanilla based content like new pets, mounts, and enchantment effects.  Some of them include various bug fixes and visual upgrades too.  They aren't just up and sitting there with nothing going on.
---
I would like to get my epic mount . Grind in between dungeons for gearing . I would like to focus on that even before trying to raid
---
Auto stand up from sitting if you cast a spell could be in this too. I got used to it fast so i dont find it a big deal, but you notice it after drinking then trying to cast a spell sitting down.
---
Updated totem graphics for those sweet Troll totems.
---
Warlocks take up 7
---
Mages take up 1 or 3 depending on spec
---
Shadow Priest gets 2
---
Druids get 1
---
Warriors get 3, 4 if Thunderfury
---
Another one goes to Nightfall if your guild runs it
---
Hunters get shafted, Rogues get shafted.
---
Rogues can't even use Rupture most of the time even though it scales better than Evis.

---
Can‚Äôt blizzard put in fake characters from proxys (or sumthing) to simulate stress, or is the stress test actually a PR move? Forgive my ignorance..
---
your mom was there, then she was pregnant. that's all I remember.
---
All the ‚Äúnew‚Äù content that came with BFA has either been a super watered down version of WoD and Legion content (Tables, WQ, etc.) or has completely failed on delivering a fun experience (Warfronts) or were blatant lies (advertising zandalari trolls, and kul‚Äôtiran humans would be part of BFA launch).
---
have you ever driven stick? Your feet can be really fucking fast.
---
I‚Äôm not sure about mages, but warlocks and raid and pvp in the same spec.
---
Rank 14? That‚Äôs weapons and they are insanely good
---
Berserking doesn't lower GCD in vanilla unfortunately
---
The very top end guilds who min max and do speed runs required warlocks to farm ss for raid. This will not be the case for 90% of people who pick warlock. Also warlocks have more quality of life aside from portals. They don‚Äôt need to drink or eat.
---
Yep. Plus we'll spend months farming MC before BWL comes out. Then months farming MC and BWL before AQ40 comes out.
---
There is no reason why you need the entire raid to have optimal specs and manage debuff slots for your 17th Ragnaros kill. BWL hits farm status quickly, too, and there is plenty of wiggle room for a slightly suboptimal build or seven.
---
If you're doing progression raids in AQ40 or Naxx, it's more relevant, but that's a relatively short period in the lifespan of Classic WoW.
---
imo, play what you enjoy. Maybe you play your preferred build for the first 18 months and then switch to full Resto or whatnot when you get to Twin Emps/Naxx.
---
Judgment Armor Master Race
---
Playing around with specs is what keeps it interesting for me.
---
wrong
---
The pserver I‚Äôm playing on must not have exp at an accurate rate then
---
As an OG shaman, this speaks to me XD
---
Im partial to shadow priest. You only have mana for like 1 person but holy hell do you just melt their face. I also liked being able to switch holy for raids. Mind control also lets you really mess with people (jumping them off boats, zepps, into lava in BRS, off cliffs) fun for messing with the other faction
---
This guy gets it. It's all about threat and HP pool as a DW fury tank. With enough HP, insta-gibs are no longer possible, and keeping the tank alive is then on the healers.
---
Bears were previously seen as non-raid tank viable because they can't shield block or def cap. BUT, this is irrelevant for the same fights that warriors would tank as DW threat. Bears bring HP pool, and serious TPS, exactly what DW fury tanks do.
---
&gt; at ~4 minutes in we can see a warrior in full mail but no shield (2,000 armor?) getting hit by a scarlet evoker for around 60-70 damage (99 crushing blow).
---
How do you know it's a Scarlet Evoker hitting him? There's like a dozen mobs on him. 2000 armor with no shield is also highballing it at that level, it's possible but he's more likely to be a fair bit below that (much more likely to be 1500ish) since most people aren't decked out in the best possible gear for their level.
---
&gt; Caster mobs appear to be hitting low! 65 on the diviners, slightly less on the other Library casters. But some elites like the monks are slapping him around for nearly 85-100 in what I'm guessing 2000 armor (30% phys damage reduction for that level).
---
Same here: I suspect 2000 armor is a gross overestimation. He seems to be level 34, so if we assume he wears the generally best possible gear available at his level (ie. item level 39 mail gear), he's going to have roughly 1350-1400 armor without a shield. And since most people don't wear the best possible gear for their level, it's more likely his total armor is closer to 1200 or even less.
---
Though you happen to be right about the damage reduction: 1350 armor is roughly 30% DR against a level 34 opponent.
---
The pserver I‚Äôm playing on must not have it at an accurate rate then
---
What if Spearmints is so excited about critting for 2000 that he farts?
---
Damn didn‚Äôt think of it that way... Wasn‚Äôt trying to be self centred, I just saw a pattern with every major release and wanted to speed up the process to a stable server population.
---
don't care you're completely irrelevant to me
---
This is anecdotal, so take it with a grain of salt, but for the brief stint I was hemo in Vanilla I don't remember it making that much of a difference for others and going that spec seriously hindered my own damage (I went from top 3 on the damage meters via daggers to somewhere between the 10's and 20's).
---
Again, anecdotal, not to be taken as gospel.
---
Some people want to enjoy the journey and not just rush to max. It's not Live, the classic leveling experience is a huge part of the game. Taking the time to explore the cities and immerse yourself in the world is what makes vanilla so great.
---
I don't see how posting anything from streamers adds anything to the debate. Should be completely banned. If people are interested in steamers it's obvious where to go look. This forum should be for discussions like the excellent beta bug thread. Not advertising space for toxic streamers
---
Deadmines was always known as VC, to me.
---
The guy killed jaina mythic. He's probably among the best players to play the game, and nothing in vanilla would compare pve wise. Sure on his one down his parse wasn't great, but stop with your bullshit.
---
OP, I'm really glad you had fun! Nobody can take that away from you. There is still a bit of community in the BFA version of the game, and I've seen it myself. I've actually only played the game since Cataclysm, so I get where you're coming from. The first time I ever played vanilla WoW was on a private server that was active in 2016 and started with the letter "N".
---
The reason I personally like Classic over BFA is because the mechanics, leveling, and the talent trees and the overall difficulty are fun - the world is dangerous, and that facilitates a good community naturally. In BFA, even if you do find someone to level with, the game is pretty easy, even without heirlooms, even considering that the world scales with you. If that's more your style, that's valid too. We just simply have different tastes, and there is nothing wrong with that. My significant other prefers BFA over Classic, and that's because the game is just relaxing &amp; easy to level in, and you can go to literally any zone you want to. 
---
For me, struggling together with others creates friendships that last! I'll give a real life example - coming from a military career, going through Basic Training made me at least 3 lifelong friends that I still speak to today, and we share our career progression and awards that we get in a group chat. It wasn't easy, and still isn't, but it's worth it. Classic WoW, in a weird sense, has that same feeling for me - struggle, hardship, bonding with others through that struggle, and the reward of feeling like you accomplished something great.
---
It's the most underrated class in vanilla. Bear tanking is strong, and they are a great healer aslong as there aren't too many druids in the raidgroup (max 2-3).
---
I'd honestly be surprised if Blizz didn't carry this over, similar to the mailbox system. They said during the initial Classic reveal that small things, such as the mailbox, aren't worth the time investment to go reduce usability. The calendar feature may fall into that, but it's a small feature that I don't think a blue post would think of mentioning.
---
earthen ring represent! &lt;Ruin&gt;, &lt;Blood Fist&gt;, wasn't there &lt;Warcry&gt;?.. hmm. some good times. shout out to the guys from &lt;Shadow Remains&gt; too. can't forget to say hi to AIE. shit, and &lt;Nightlife&gt;.
---
I like the way Vanilla is restrictive on many things. It gives flavor and make people be committed to their class. Youre just not the best mage. Youre the best frost mage. See where I'm going? Giving everything away for free just make everything less valuable.
---
It must, I assumed it was 1x because that‚Äôs what it said on the pserver list but they must be way off
---
I have three kids.  They know about WoW because my wife and I played since 2004. I was in vanilla beta. They've seen it.  They tried Vanilla and they were turned off by it.  They played retail and they stuck with it.  It was more in line with current games in many ways.  I still play WoW.  I've played Vanilla on private servers in the last year as well.  My wife refuses to play Classic, despite being a solid raider back during Vanilla and BC: "I don't have time for that, are you kidding?  I have kids!" She remembers the grind, the time it took to do things.  I have friends who played back in 2004 - 2009, they chuckle at the idea but won't play for similar reasons.  Quote one of my friends: "I get MAX 2 hours a day to play games. I'm not spending it trying to grind in Vanilla WoW."  
---
The people left who would want to play are those who are older, played WoW, enjoyed the vanilla experience AND still actually have time to play (or are willing to sacrifice sleep for it). MMORPGs are a shrinking market to begin with, and the market for those who yearn for a more old-school experience is even smaller. It's just not a big market.  Yes, there are people.  No, it's not a lot.  
---
The people who are guaranteed to keep playing are those who are already playing on private servers. Those who haven't played in a long time?  You have a percent who will check it out, remember how slow shit is, how hard shit is, and they're going to say "ya know what? I don't have time for this. I'm going to go play Sea of Thieves with my buddies."
---
And I get that people here are so super stoked for Classic that reading this kind of POV doesn't feel great and is counter to what most HOPE will happen. But I'm not about to delude myself into that just because I'm stoked for Classic (and I really am!) that it will become this huge hit.
---
thats not the reason people play private servers, those options are generally frowned on and used as money to support the server costs,
---
20 mageweave = 1 bag. Mageweave drops from 38ish+ mobs :D
---
No changes simply means no changes outside of Vanilla. 1.1-1.12
---
It doesn't mean no changes to or ignore that Vanilla changed between 1.1 to 1.12, it simply means no changes outside of what was in Vanilla. At one point a frankenpatch was on the table.
---
This seems to be an exceptionally difficult concept to grasp, I see.
---
Just gotta bet better than the other shadow priests.
---
Also start looking for a guild now :)
---
I find cooking useless while leveling and a huge time sink.
---
Just wait till 60 and do cooking/ fishing in tandem. A little extra spirit and stamina isn't that big of a deal while leveling in vanilla. 
---
There are like 6 useful foods in the game. Winter Squid, Mp5 fish, Strength food, and stam food and you can't get most of them until lvl 40+
---
Lol, same here. I was Tauren to start, so their totems were spot on, but the Troll ones look better IMO and I think I'm gonna go Troll for my Shaman. Still not sure if it's gonna be my first character or not though, lol.
---
Great post - it‚Äôs nice to be reminded of how much flexibility the old talent trees afford a lot of classes. 
---
While some builds may not be optimal for one activity or another, being diligent and farming the appropriate gear and leveling your professions really helps in the long run. Guilds that see this (and good attendance, performance, and attitude) are much more likely to accommodate someone who doesn‚Äôt have the ideal build for their role.
---
You‚Äôre sort of right to be concerned. Shadow priest is awesome, but guilds only take one. It‚Äôd be smart to get healing pre-raid too as a backup. Benediction/Anethema makes it an easier switch
---
Pretty sure my wife is undead lmao
---
I'm super excited to make content for classic! I'm, unfortunately, not in the beta :/ But you will definitely have some WoW classic noobs to watch... And laugh at!
---
Ill take something tedious over spamming 1 all night. 
---
If anything the simplicity of boss dps rotations in vanilla makes the trash that much more appealing, "look at all the abilities I get to use!"
---
You convinced me with "With a conservative estimate of 30g per hour you can farm 6000 gold in 200 hours"
---
I know I can do much better than 30g/h, but if I was shit at farming or hated it like craghack, I would still probabaly be planning on a second toon. 
---
5,214.285714285714‚Ä¨ ish, not much under though and I do hope to play for more than a year. I still think the 200h estimate is way over what it should be early on as I'd be levling using rested xp, and have help from a account with a 60 on it.
---
I wouldn't care that much either. Just pointing at that fact that it does hurt something over not hurting anything. Also, in PVP I really wouldn't like it. Can you imagine a teir 3 warrior moging into like dungeon set. Semitruck hiding as a Tonka.
---
&gt; used as money to support the server costs
---
Or they would... dun dun dun... DIE.
---
you people are pathetic losers GG. Blizz has youre asses trained to do what they want.  You all are so sad you activated your wow sub just to play a 2 hour demo. LOfuckingL
---
It's a matter of balance, I think that 25g is more balanced than 50 or 10. That 25 is the sweetspot or whatever you want to call it.
---
You're probably right. Cross realm in phase 3 is just silly
---
Since when is threat an issue for feral tanks? They out-threat warriors by a mile.
---
I love that logic. "It used to get patches throughout it's life". Yes it did, and TBC was the expansion that ended WoW that was before it, therefore turning it into vanilla. What's so hard to understand? If you are so fascinated with your broken logic, then blizzard should simulate the patches that led to 1.12, not some new bullshit that literally ignores the very meaning of the word "Classic".
---
Suggest some changes, just curious. Let's see how easy it is to "patch" the game.
---
They said explicitly that the first stress test gave them a lot of useful data.
---
So basically 80% won't be able to login the first week cause they underestimate how many people want to play classic =)
---
Then level a seperate rogue and save both time and money.
---
Usually you also reset it at a boss like Majordomo or Chromaggus. 
---
Btw ZG and AQ20 are big in the pug world. You can also pug up to twin emps in AQ fairly easily. Same in Naxx, doing spider wing and maybe noth + razu is fairly easy.
---
If your raid leader disallows the healers from healing melee dps and tells warriors and rogues to just use bandages, maybe.
---
This literally happened in the same guild, lol.  Some time toward the end of the expansion we did some PUG raids with Blood Legion and couldn't wait to write home to guild chat about how their raids heal everyone, including melee.
---
Honestly I have been playing old school RuneScape and I like that they add new stuff to keep it fresh. I don‚Äôt see why this wouldn‚Äôt work here too. Not only that but people would drop off after a little bit because there are ‚Äúno change‚Äù to the game. It‚Äôll get boring after a while. I think keeping the game at base level the same but adding new things would keep it interesting.  Also by new things I don‚Äôt mean things that have already been added to later expansions I mean greasy ideas they can come up with. But that‚Äôs just imo.
---
Mind Flay targets face.
---
yeah, tbc was so damn good!
---
Green iron helm is pretty cheap and can be worn from late 20s-SM. 
---
The mats are cheap anyway, who knows how much it‚Äôll cost.
---
I agree. Especially in class balance. What game EVER sets and forgets classes? I understand the skepticism in Blizzards ability to tune, but we aren't getting a game at this point, it's a private server. Idc if the minority of you wanted a private server so u can play what's OP, I can guarantee the majority actually in game and not on Reddit will not.
---
 So I can value their opinions, but it seems the Nochange crowd doesn't value anyone else's opinion. That's what bothers me the most. I played vanilla, it was so much fun. I don't want to get some untuned, forgotten version -- I want a full game like that. Bring it back with no changes, but at least work on the game. And if they can't balance it the way people want, fucking fire them and hire someone who can. We're finally getting back Vanilla, and I don't want to just play it for a year, have everyone be bored of it, and it's a ghost town except for 5k people. I want this to be the future, because the way retail is, it sucks.
---
It's shill* (correcting people when you lack argumentation to try to gain a high ground is BS mate)
---
You're just being a pedantic smartass about wording, about "phasing in", you clearly aren't interested in the terms, in the tech, or why blizzard even bothers developping layering.
---
It's sad to see someone so little to say with all the information out there.
---
If you get to 60 within the first month or sooner I would really advise just buying epic mount. it just makes everything you do faster really pays for itself
---
Vanilla up to WoTLK...
---
Man, it was legendary to be a part of WoW back then. Really something to behold. Back when WoW still had 10+ million players, Mr. T ads, Mountain Dew, their own trading cards you could win cosmetic in-game items from... It was so perfectly executed, where you felt like it wasn‚Äôt just some game, you felt like you were entering a whole new world. It truly was an experience, something special for its time, much like how awesome TES: Oblivion was for lots of people. 
---
I don‚Äôt think there will ever be an experience like that again, partly because the internet was still kind of in its infancy, and all you had were forums or Thottbot or guidebooks from EB Games for info. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Classic is going to be amazing and the priv servers I‚Äôve played on have been incredibly fun, no nostalgia needed - but that really was a new era for MMORPGs. It was awesome to be a part of that.
---
which class has fewer spells in classic than bfa? i have a hard time believing that. But even if true, in bfa you don't have spell ranks so.. those take key bindings too
---
You start with 2 when you can learn the ability, and gain 2 more for each level. Since 55 water can be learned at 55, you make 10 of them per cast.
---
Not counting ranks, Priest and Rogue for sure.
---
Depends on if blizzard ignores bot caravans in Classic like they do in BFA.
---
No economy makes the game boring.
---
My mom was not pregnant in the 60s, nice try.
---
Exactly my point thank you. Tryhard guilds may not be in favor but for 90% of the guilds it does just fine especially for classes in demand. 
---
People will lower their standard for wanted classes. 
---
Rogues Warriors, Hunters and Mages may not get that special treatment but thats what you get for jumping on the dps hype train.
---
Pokemon go style mobile game soon. Im hyped lol
---
Blizzard has been doing shady shit like this ever since they wouldn't upgrade servers and made guilds transfer to other servers.
---
Anyone who subs to BfA for classic not a beta is a pathetic loser. Pathetic Loser
---
If they want to do dungeons, it will. If they want to do group quests, it will.
---
Also, that person you interacted with, you will never see again unless you add each other to bnet, as opposed to vanilla where the players you meet actually exist in the same world as you.
---
I always saved those for rogues. Idk if they are usable on players in 1.12 though
---
I think I'm going to focus on making as much gold as I can at first. Get mining/herbalism and focus on gathering materials to sell on the AH. I'm not in a huge rush to level... I want to take my time and enjoy leveling this time around, instead of being so focused on progressing as much as I can. There's too much of that anxiety in retail right now. "WHATS THE NEXT LEVEL, BETTER ITEM, ETC I CAN GET??"
---
Wrong.
---
If Gucci was cheaper and better than the Walmart brand then yes I would say Gucci is cheap.
---
The AV food is cheaper AND better than the normal level 45 food/water. The AV food is cheap.
---
Tree form for druids. Really TBC class balance and talent trees I would be happy with.
---
So thankful when they added the refreshment table.
---
Thanks for the backup but I‚Äôm far from one of the best players haha, I just linked the parses to prove I‚Äôm not completely awful and can play this game without cookie cutter icy-veins specs as the guy above suggested.
---
No it isn‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs a known quantity. You cannot make this become a challenge, and for many it was a challenge. Not at this difficulty.
---
Hunter, Warlock, Mage, in that order IMO.
---
Game is pretty straight forward. You start out with 1 or 2 skills, it eases you into it pretty well.
---
If there are enough people so the community won't be split to the point of where blizzard need's to integrate CRZ again, then fine.
---
Though i have to point out that it was WotLK that started the downfall. It was excellent up and including Ulduar, then it came...ToC and IC, effectively ruining most of the content, and the LFG tool that landed the first blow to the community aspect. From there on, they embraced that idea fully, and it degraded ever since.
---
Then again, i'd rather have TBC than some Classic+ monstrosity, i just hope there will indeed be enough players so we won't all end up screwed.
---
Sorry bud if you think they'll put resources into bcc or wotlk you are crazy - at the earliest they would do that 4 or 5 years from now *if and that's a big if they did it.

The warlock epic mount costs about 900gs but if I remember correctly about 300g is for reagents that can be reused and used to help other warlock .  So Some warlocks will buy the reagents and sell runs for about 50-60g. My numbers are probably a bit off but I remember getting my epic lock mount for around 600-650g with the help of a lock selling runs.
---
Doing deadmines is not good exp/hr. If you level fast you skip most dungeons
---
? That doesn't make sense you were advocating for hybrid builds being viable everywhere.
---
Never said they need to let it go, just not to be so negative and obnoxious about it. It‚Äôs a beta after all. Blizzard has built this from basically nothing and done some truly groundbreaking work to get to this point. It would be cool if the community just reported this stuff in game instead of plastering it online like it‚Äôs some form of shame on Blizzard for making the game this way.
---
Just kind of tired of seeing the karma-grabbing of ‚Äúlook what bad thing Blizzard did to OUR game!‚Äù
---
Early levels, horde is actually easier imo due to Barrens. But post-barrens you are right.
---
Not complaining, I am asking a question.
---
Hi everyone,
---
I am still in the forming process, so I don‚Äôt have a robust amount of info yet. That said, I would invite you to message me if you would be interested in joining a guild with the following distinctives:
---
‚Ä¢Horde PvP (Nathrezim server preferred if original servers are resurrected‚Äî otherwise we will select a suitable high-pop PvP server free of major streamers)
---
‚Ä¢Casual but guild-first attitude (for Molten Core and other early raids, PvP and off-meta specs should be fine, but players may need to change if we are getting stonewalled due to specs). We will also enjoy the leveling process rather than sprinting to endgame.
---
‚Ä¢Raiding ‚Äúofficially‚Äù once a week, probably Tuesdays with 8 or 9PM Central start time (with an additional unofficial raid on Saturdays)
---
‚Ä¢An attendance-based free rolls loot distribution (attendance only taken for ‚Äúofficial‚Äù raid days)
---
My main wishes are to provide a social and friendly atmosphere where raiding can still take place without requiring people to set aside more than one night a week.
---
Message me if you‚Äôd be interested! Thanks!
---
The devastating blow problem is answered by hitting armor cap and stacking HP pools to nearly TBC levels.
---
This proves my point even more. Oh boy...
---
Since it‚Äôs two actions in Classic (dismount THEN cast), it requires two button pressed in the addon API.
---
You say that till 85% of the fight will be auto shot. At least locks get to press something. If you want a class with rotation play warrior. Everything else is 2 buttons maybe.
---
Warlocks can use apply  useful curse for raid. Use corruption (bosses will have 16 debuffs at launch) and also get instant cast shadow bolts!
---
I really hope they market it in that way... WoW was hugely mainstream and successful in its day, but it seems like PC gaming is even more popular and accessible than it was back then. And there were plenty of kids who wanted to play WoW,  but their parents wouldn't pay a sub, they didn't want to be considered a dork, etc.
---
I don't think that Blizzard has the wrong mindset. I think the have the wrong people in mind when making design decisions.
---
Sweet, I was worried it couldn't be learned until 60, and therefore would only be 2 per cast. 10 per cast is great!
---
The guy will be ranking.
---
I unsubscribed from Hobbs years ago after he was abusing a YouTube bug to force his videos to the top of the subscription box over and over by switching the video from private to public.
---
Its how they bypasss advertising. Have their low life followers ~~post~~ spam the sub with their garbage and claim they had nothing to do with it.
---
Combine fishing and cooking. You can level them both to 225 in an hour.
---
Some of these early quest rewards being referenced worked on raid bosses well into the game. Don't feel bad about saving those.
---
And the [Sparkmetal Coif](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=55)  you can get from the Morbent Fel quest in Duskwood
---
Complaining about free water?
---
I think skinning with one of the two is better/ easier. Kinda tough to level both mining and herbalism and combining them while gathering is again tough.
---
Why didn't you know this?
---
Yeah same I managed to log in for around 90 seconds during the actual stress test time - and then I didn't actually try again for about 5 hours and managed to log in and play quite easily the rest of the time (Easily not counting every single starter area mob being camped to infinity)
---
Vanish on CD, rip
---
I cant remember what I did last year. You sure have a pretty clear vision from when you we‚Äôre 9yo. I salute your brain in that case.
---
You will melt faces in PvP as a shadow priest.
---
This is a joke, right?
---
Dying
---
Priest
---
Squadw
---
You say this but I have 1 to 5 in under 30 mins on multiple private server launches and 1 to 10 in under 2.5 hours.  As long as you don't have connection problems and can actually play, this is more then doable.
---
IT'S JUST A PRANK BRO
---
&gt; The types of folks who look to clear Naxx under two hours and all other content in under an hour see hunters as nothing more than a tranq bot. 
---
See, this is what the OP means. They're not just tranq bots, **but also Nightfall bots**. People need to appreciate the full potential of the raiding hunter!
---
&gt; Paladins have to spec 10 points into their healing tree just to get consecrate
---
The good news is that those 10 points are some of the best damage talents they can get at low level caus its vanilla and the trees are weird.
---
I dont think so but maybe, and tanks? I played dk and while they are not in classic a blood dk definitelly has less abilities than classic tanks. Unless you are comparing only tank abilities then yeah for sure but a warrior in classic has access to  fury and arms abilities too.
---
It‚Äôs magical the effect those first day beta stream numbers had on the attitudes of the retail streamer community toward Classic.
---
So what your saying is that he spams SS better now than he did 15 years ago?  You only have SS at the start with rogue so how is skill involved?
---
I'm not saying values are wrong. I'm just saying that spamming one move doesn't take skill.
---
You'd never have to respecc. It's *YOU* that desperately want to rank and hardcore raid at the same time. Two opposites of a spectrum. Just level a second rogue, keep them focused on seperate things and save both time and gold. 
---
You're asking for something the game isn't balanced for. Your intention is to be a part of the 0.1% of Classic, and you want Blizzard to cater to you specifically.
---
I'd look towards paladins since they are simple to play for the most part and they have enough armor to give some leeway for mistakes like aggro when healing or doing dps in dungeons.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxMGsVbZfZVMGp0t 
---
Was wondering if this would be a good spec to play some pvp in. Kind of like a counter support. Can still heal and support your team. But also do some dps and silence
---
Yeah but one of the main drivers of this originally was a ton of GM tickets. People would constantly ‚Äústeal‚Äù the GBank, or own the GBank alt and ragequit.
---
Interesting, I have never played rogue competitively so thanks for the info.
---
I‚Äôve been playing through virtually every class with my fianc√©. As she is also new to the game. She found mage to be the easiest to pickup and had the most fun to play. We took that all the way to 60 as a warrior/mage combo. 
---
I would say that warlock would likely be next in line for the easiest if she were to go at things solo initially due to the pet mechanics. - my fianc√© personally found managing a pet to be frustrating and annoying.
---
Edit: mage is easy due to the lack of complexity in the damage rotation, it allows you to focus more on what‚Äôs going on around you as a new player, plus you feel useful handing out food and drink to everyone. 
---
Warlock is easy due to the pet (similar to hunter).
---
you're [objectively wrong](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx)
---
So lets elaborate, you propose changes, and throw up this bullshit as a "joke" of a change? I get it, you are one of them "i have that perfect vision for the future of classic in my mind". We all do, except when you start proposing, and more people start to point the flaws and argue between each other, then you can see why threads like this are trash.
---
You don't even know what you mean when you say changes. You just think how good it would be, after all...it's not up to me, i just propose... the developers will deliver.
---
Consider changing your positioning as heal. If the enemy spell casters are able to reach you that easy you are probably far to upfront (same goes for warriors that can easily charge you)
---
I ain't fucking resubbing just for a chance to get into the beta, that's a scummy practice by Blizzard.
---
Maintanks make terrible raidleaders, as the position in itself obstructs overview of the boss area.
---
But I do agree that hunters are perfect for the raidleader position, as they can mostly autopilot their gameplay and focus their attention to what happens in the raid. As an added boon, hunters can easily avoid death and pulling aggro, which is a great benefit for the raidleader position.
---
Mages also make great raid leaders, as they have a 1 button rotiation and plenty of "oh shit" buttons to stay alive.
---
did you ask every single person on the server? More than 5? Didn't think so.
---
&gt;Class balance was a nightmare in Vanilla
---
**There doesn't have to be class balance in an MMORPG.**  
---
Scissors cut Paper. Rock smashes Scissors. Paper covers Rock == Fun game.  
---
Scissors cut Paper and Rock. Paper covers Scissors and Rock. Rock smashes Scissors and Paper == Crap game, because this means that Scissors, Paper and Rock are the same freckin thing. Thats's great in an FPS, but boring af in an RPG.
---
Here is a nice and easy food prep

https://youtu.be/DYwPipedxgk
---
Expansions? Oh my bad you mean over time - yeah they peaked at what 14 million players or so in tbc/ wotlk? But server phasing and sharding allowed playing together even on dead servers.
---
I imagine classic will have a set number of servers at launch with X amount of layers which allow (instances of a server) - the idea being once server pop dies down, they'll merge all server layers into 1 :)
---
test it out, it's not. it's about 12-16% depends on how much leather you have (usually you are not running full leather if you balance your stats correctly).
---
My favorite moment from vanilla was when totally a noob moment i look back and laugh at. I was dungeoning for the first time in Deadmines. I was with my sister and future brother in law and I was trying to impress him (i was like 15ish and trying to be cool for the 20something year old) with my mage skills even though i was a noob. We get to Van cleef, he drops a pretty rare non-mage item and in the excitement, i accidentally click need. I get the item and my sister, b-in-law and his friend all stop and turn to me in game and they give me this "WTF did you just do" look. I try to give it back to him, because i still didn't understand the whole soulbound thing yet. needless to say, we had to run deadmines like 3 more times to get it again. My most noobish moment to this day
---
I've seen several instances where first time female players really enjoy the healing role.
---
Yeah, in stormwind in the bar where the cooking trainer is, on the second floor balcony there's a "master of recipes" that has a ton of stuff, even ones from quests in the local zones.
---
This got under my skin A LOT more than it should have, glad I'm not the only one that remembers
---
classic is retail
---
just back at the start
---
Depends if u/Spearmints approves it himself.
---
Stay on top of cooking and other professions as well. It's super easy to level past them and you dont want to back peddle zones for stuff you could've gotten already
---

---
What about, eating the buff food, that someone else made!?
---
This is dumb.
---
Why do you shut his ideas down and answer them with your own ideas that you sell as fact? Do you hear yourself?
---
Hoping /r/classicwow has a list of all the big streamers and what servers they're rolling on, too, so I know which to avoid.
---
Many private servers did intentionally overtune content. The K server (which is one of the older ones) was "undertuned" (aka. Blizzlike) and a lot of people complained about it because they never wiped and could just AoE down group content. N came out and was tuned much higher which gave a healthy challenge and went a long way to preserve the Vanilla experience. There are a lot of old threads of people complaining about the tuning on K. 
---
Raids are often buffed with 3x HP on bosses or more, especially T7 Naxx on WOTLK servers. Otherwise, the content gets cleared within 8 hours of release and many of the mechanics are never even seen because the bosses get DPSed down so quickly. Here's a post from 11 days ago going into planned content buffs: https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/bpmlyr/dragonblight_naxxramas_content_buffs/
---
Also, I've seen that video but group content is the main area where the game has gotten much easier along with skill.
---
It was, /equip has been part of the API since day 1, so we can always have equipment sets through macros and therefore by UI based addons as well.
---
This!!! Although I definitely enjoyed the Level 19 Twink arena a little bit more. Nothing like grinding DM to get gear for my Rogue and then just endlessly playing WSG against other twinks. Was always a blast seeing names you recognized and knowing it was a gonna be a good match.
---
where did i complain? i asked a question. relax
---
I already provided a laundry list of things that are different. It is far far far more than just SS.
---
Yeah, the point where the downfall started is different for everyone, we know some people say it was flying in burning Crusade and we know some people would say it was anything after Classic
---
Usually for all builds you want to have Divine Fury for healing for obvious reasons.

Seeking to establish a guild that is **fundamentally about PvP**, and **ignores PvE raiding**. Dark Spirit seeks to recruit primarily those interested in Druid, Priest, and Shaman classes of all specs. Ignore raid drama, forget heal-botting, and kick in some alliance teeth.
---
**Faction**: Horde
---
**Servertype**: PVP
---
**Time Zone:** US East (EDT/EST)
---
**Event Time**: Every other day, primetime
---
**Main Classes:** Druid, Priest, Shaman
---
**Alt Classes:** Any
---
**wPVP &amp; BGs:** Yes
---
**PvE Raiding:** No
---
**Optional Twink Bracket:** 19
---
**Phased Progression**
---
* Phase 1: Core Quests &amp; Dungeons for key equipment quest rewards. Twink prep. wPvP zone control &amp; town raiding.
---
* Phase 2+: sPvP Reputation &amp; Rank 10+ gear progression
---
**Events &amp; Schedule**
---
* Guild event every other day, loosely primetime EST, as strict scheduling is not as necessary as PvE raiding. As such, other NA time zones may not be a problem.
---
* sPvP/BG , wPvP zone/town raid, key quests, etc.
---
**Interested?**

---
CoS, CoE, CoR/CoW, Sunder, Faerie Fire, Improved Shadowbolt, Demoralizing Shout, Nightfall (proc), Thunder Clap/Fury (+1 for the stormstrike effect of TF proc), Improved Scorch/Winter's Chill, Ignite (post BWL), Hunter's Mark, SW:P, Shadow Weaving, Gift of Arthas, Annihilator (proc), Judgment of Wisdom/Light(alliance only).
---
Also worth mentioning is that Taunt takes a slot, arcanite Dragonling is very strong post BWL, and Hunter T2 proc that increases Ranged AP against the target.
---
All of that is higher priority than corruption.
---
Oh sorry took the  "only 2? I hope not :(" as not wanting to spend time to make free water.
---
Warlock is a good pick, relevant for dps/raid, relatively good at leveling, people like pets.   
---
The cliche is healing, Priest are a good pick but they are harder to level up, especially if going solo.    
---
Hunter I am not sure I would recommend, it seems the general consensus is they were overrated, they level more easily but they will have a hard time fitting in end game and you will need to be confident to defend your place.
---
The obvious play is to release the remastered "WoW Trilogy!"
---
Vanilla, BC, Wrath. Progression styled in phases as we've seen. Separate eternal servers for each.
---
It just makes sense, after Wrath they redid the old world so it's a clean breakpoint.
---
It's almost as if you have to make sacrifices and choose a path.
---
You can't be good at all aspects of the game if you plan on doing everything, plus it'll be less efficient not focusing on one facet of the game. The whole point of the arbitrary cap is to force you to choose what is most important.
---
Else, we get into the same problem Retail is in where you can do everything with all specs so at that point you're just doing a checklist every week for doing all 99 things before the next reset.
---
 Which is why just about everyone except you would prefer a sub par healer, with insane damage buffs, to a bottom tier DPS with fewer damage buffs. 
---
I don't agree theyre as bottom teir as you make the out to be when ive seen past and concurrent examples of them doing competing dps over tanks, especially on Horde. I like you believed they were useless when I played vanilla, but met a guy who shattered that perception. Ive seen example of him doing things a spriest shouldnt be able to do dps wise, or so i thought. I'm just saying give it a chance when classic rolls around theyre primed to be easier than pservers and we have much better knowledge about the games systems now.
---
No one brings 5 warlocks. Maybe 3. But even then, that's irrelevant.
---
Edit: also raided a decent amount on Horde and the only time we brought Spriest was for Raz.
---
Yet I need to relax :)

It's just $18.99 CAD. There's no conversions anymore and hasn't been for a long time. Also it's never been 20 USD.

Garr?
---
If people don't enjoy playing the class they made and spent all their time on then what makes you think the game will still be fun if they can't enjoy the class they picked?
---
If a newbie comes into Classic without previous knowledge and they play a druid and run Feral, lmao they're not going to get guild invites. Do you think thats fun?
---
Because this is my first time playing wow, and most games from vanilla wows era dont let you get such an easy self res?
---
Do you realize how idiotic you sound raging at me for trying to help newbies pick their class? 
---
Can't you see i'm just trying to show people there isnt just one hard way to go and its perfectly viable to mix a pvp fun spec and a raiding one?
---
But also, it's not like those icy-veins specs don't have theory crafting behind them.
---
No man. You gotta save those low level limited consumables that lower armor and snare targets. Hold onto them until you‚Äôre fighting against someone on the other faction. Someone you *really* want to see dead. That way they know that you hated them so much you actually used that Really Sticky Glue.
---
thats what I forgot, lion meat and bear steak!
---
I agree it wasnt hard to keep cooking current just had to say 'ok i'll kill all these types of beast once in awhile'
---
Only issue in my vanilla experience was the 5hr long queue times on my server.
---
Epic riding?
---
A lot of the tests are for the various choke points in the login flow. The authentication system, connecting to the realm list, character creation, ect Those aren't as easily mimicked, as far as I know.
---
Yeah it looks like Longarms actually plays the objective unlike some ^^*cough* ^^OP ^^*cough*
---
100% agree with you on the diversity- I just think classic will be a 1 off, I don't see why anyone would be play "modern wow" after classic comes out- unless they just don't enjoy mmorpgs.
---
Agreed. I forgot how important food buffs and potions were.. playing eso right now reminded me since that game lives off of those consumables
---
&gt; and you make SO much gold with those profs
---
No, you don't.
---
I don't think you remember BC at all, man.
---
Here in BC as long as they don't have an office/building/whatever in the province we don't have to pay tax on software.
---
I do agree on that. I loved everything about vanilla wow. Im sorry you dont have more great memories from this game.
---
I still have starting items in bank, cause you never know when I‚Äôll need that potion that heals me for 50hp.

Check out that vid for duo leveling.

The only advertisements youll see is from loud mouthed streamers that will push people away from the game and not bring them in. Blizzard doesn't care
---
Well, they aren't going to make every expansion into their own game.
---
They can, but that‚Äôs a controlled test and they probably have done that multiple times. Once you stop having control of the user, they will do things that cause unforeseen issues and are able to submit individual reports for each problem.
---
Problems occur organically in unforeseen situations when you add the real user element into the mix. 
---
I think we broke their character creation authentication server because while they had the ability for multiple layers, they had incorrectly tuned/setup the server to allow characters to be created after they were technically at server pop cap. It was a great thing to break/encounter but definitely didn‚Äôt allow them to test as many people on their server as they wanted.

Not mine I will not take the credit for this amazing work. Many you list are utterly useless compared to corruption... Would also like to point out this is based on the 12 debuff limit.... not even the xtra 4 we get &gt;.&lt;
---
In the long run, I actually ended up making a profit off of it by advertising and charging other warlocks to initiate the summon event for them.
---
That is true, if you are on a PvP server rank 1 would be worth getting.
---
Well, the nost core servers, which are by far the biggest vanilla servers, did not intentionally buff any content. They always strived to be correct blizzlike, and sometimes they just missed the mark and added too high values.
---
Wow.  She's never touched a PC game before and her first foray is going to be Vanilla WoW?  Savage.  Is she actually on-board with this, or is this a pipe dream?
---
I mean, if you want to lose out on 2-3 DPS that do about double the damage of a warlock to make one fight in the first raid slightly easier, sure. Most would just put up some OT warriors with a shield.
---
That's you moving goalposts...
---
Define "mass appeal." I'd like to hear how Nintendo Mini with 3.6 million units sold is "niche." Or Starcraft which maintained an intense competitive scene right up until its sequel dropped. 
---
The point is that you claimed that there aren't any games worth playing. There clearly are.
---
The difference is that we have largely been able to play these games or their successors. We haven't been able to play Vanilla WoW essentially ever since the Burning Crusade released.
---
I was too young back then to care to look up a meta. I just knew it was something we did lol
---
A true rez for druids. Resto is their only serious spec at 60 (not looking for an argument about this), but the lack of a true rez causes serious problems with trying to take one as the lone healer for a 5-man. Somebody is inevitably going to die, you'll have no way to rez them, they'll release and run back, and then they're staring down full respawns between the start and wherever you're at. It is a very annoying issue. Buffing them with this is good for everybody and has no real impact on pve difficulty or on pvp.
---
How bout we just report it to Blizzard before we start stating that the game is changing..
---
**"What happens after Naaaaxx?" - Thread No. 1323543245346324124523563623E56**
---
If nothing ever changes, a few hardcores will remain, alongside a few people happy to technically "retire" from WoW, and enjoying the game as a digital sunset, slowly fading away with a warm feeling.
---
If it is a tremendous success, Blizzard will take notice and do something. Additional 60 content, TBC/WOTLK, who knows.
---
The most important thing that needs to be pointed out, is how pointless this discussion is.
---
Blizzard ... the company ... :P
---
Beautiful! And I agree about the theme of a class being a good factor in making the decision. I'm stuck between Druid and Shaman and one of the problems with picking one for good and being happy with the decision is that I love both class fantasies, so that can't be the deciding factor haha.
---
You can even work to make your Dungeon 2 set.
---
I think they'll have progression servers eventually when everyones defeated and cleared AQ, they'll release BC and have a "frozen in time" server for Classic, all characters are copied from the current server to the "Frozen" server, you can choose to play Classic as it is or you can move on and play the next expansion as Blizzard has released it.
---
Thats what I look forward to.
---
Blizzard ... the company ... :)
---
It's not common sense though. I cannot wait for the shit show of BfA players trying Classic, and just raging how hard it is yelling for nerfs.
---
I couldn't find a reliable info about the droprate, but if it's 40% like on current WoWHead, then it's 2 MCPs an hour in average. Then one can just level/farm on an alt or do BG or something. Remember, I said "*tryhard* feral" :)
---
Not sure why they wouldn't have more or less full T2 at that point for tanking, even if they're not Naxx geared
---
Except he lost
---
Meh, it's more of a life style thing. If you are a bookworm you won't fit with a party person. You need another bookworm.
---
Be careful tho, bookworms can be bigger thots than club sluts.
---
&gt;Classic wasn't all sunshine and rainbows.
---
that is literally why it's good. That's what us old farts have been saying for the past 12 years. You cannot have a hill without a valley. If the entire game is a highpoint, then it's a giant featureless plateau with nothing of interest and nothing of worth.
---
because this isnt a beta its an advertisement. NOBODY they invited cares about testing. We'll be testing come August 26th because blizzard wouldnt invite veteran players
---
People have optimized everything and know everything now. Power levellers can hit 60 in a week. The hardcore ones hit it in 4 days.

How many of the fun low level quest rewards work at high level? Like the candles and really sticky glue? I thought I heard that they got nerfed at some point to make high level players resist them more often.
---
Nope you can't. Plus ores in general are more around the edges of the zone and herbs are more in the middle.
---
Ease off on the Alex Jones content it's fucking you up.
---
That's some next level dumbassery. Ranged should be the one not getting healed, since on most bosses, if you take damage as ranged you just plain suck, whereas melee get splashed with all sorts of different shit.
---
You dont need to stance dance, just have 3 points so you can charge and do a sunder, otherwise you're gonna have mobs running all over the place making things annoying.
---
That is the entire point of a stress test.
---
These thumbnails of streamers with raging faces and big letters in colour. 
---
Yeah, my 12 year old brother watches these...
---
Less servers, given technology, new names for the servers to avoid confusion.
---
Again thats your opinion. Some people liked TBC more than Vanilla. Blizzard knows that, there are people who might come back for TBC that didnt come back for Classic. Yes, it is obviously several years down the line but how many nobody knows probably 2 at the minimum but 4-5 seems like a stretch to me
---
How else did you think warlocks reset threat?
---
I'm assertive but I dont like to boss people. People would get me thinking too much about the personalities and how to deal with them. And since I'm usually 20 years or so older than most, there is a generation gap. A leader needs to be relatable.
---
If you know the content then it's easier to tell people you know how it's done, fall in line. I get lost fairly easy.
---
That said, I would love to pvp w/ my own geared warrior one day.
---
Edit: INTP-A
---
To be fair when classic was first announced there were a lot of people shouting "No changes!" at the idea of starting off on 1.12 balancing. At the same time there were people shouting "No changes!" who did want to start off on 1.12 balancing. "No changes" has always been a sort of "blanket slogan" that meant different things to different people.
---
He's more or less saying that piling on new content in a vertical fashion (E.g.: Releasing a new expansion every so many years complete with new regions to explore and new gear, mobs, abilities, etc.) is not a sustainable long-term solution for an MMO game. You don't necessarily feel the affects when the game is relatively young and still fresh (One or two expansions in) but it quickly becomes apparent and spirals out of control the longer it goes on (Five or six expansions out).
---
The vanilla experience was all designed around levels 1-60 in mind and later content that was added via expansions were mostly designed from the ground up with only that expansion's level range in mind, i.e.: BC's content was designed with 60-70 in mind, WotLK's content was designed with 70-80 in mind, etc. while simultaneously not designed with or, to an extent, incompatible with vanilla's 1-60 design philosophy.
---
On the surface, this doesn't seem like a big deal, because people have played vanilla for 4+ years and farmed it to death and everyone's eager and waiting for the next expansion, and along with that comes new gear, new mobs, new abilities, etc. But, said gear, mobs, abilities, etc. all have to be programmed to be "stronger" than its vanilla counterpart; players need to feel like their character is still leveling and growing stronger so abilities need to be buffed, gear needs to have higher stat and damage numbers, mobs need to hit harder, etc. All this leads to power creep.
---
The first expansion or two in, it isn't a big deal (Vanilla uses single digit modifiers, BC uses double digit modifiers, WotLK uses triple digit modifiers, etc.) but five or six expansions out and it gets way out of hand, requiring devs top make a difficult choice of either extending the power creep even further like five digit modifiers to adjust stats in the tens or even hundreds of thousands, or do a stat squish where they drastically reduce the stats of all gear, mobs, abilities, etc. back down to reasonable levels like they did at the start of patch 6.0 for Warlords of Draenor.
---
tl;dr: Anyone who loves playing an MMO will eventually see the long-term effects of piling new content on vertically will have negative effects on the overall experience of the game and render old content obsolete or nearly unplayable through standard game mechanics.
---
Not dualwield furytanks under death wish, to the best of my knowledge.
---
You want 2 kinds of people, old players and new players, old ones know about wow reaching them is futile since they are already ontop of it, newplayers use twitch at a bigger rate and dont watch tv so any add aimed at them is worthless.
---
Tv adds will only really reach old gamers that for some reason still watch tv. Really niche imo andnot worth the millionsin investment. Twitch is huge compared to tv.
---
Any key bind tips are welcome since mine clearly suck. Currently using Titanwolf mmo mouse with blink and poly on and it seems to work for me so far
---
Didn't that get raised to 40 at one point, or was that not until an expansion?
---
100% spot on.
---
This has gotten a serious answer a hundred times, including twice in this comment chain, but people like you are too busy spamming lol meme spec to stop and learn a thing about the math behind the game. So the blind leads the blind, and the stigma stays.
---
My advice is to keep it a secret. If you don't live together she doesn't need to know what you are exactly doing in your free time.
---
I‚Äôm not arguing that it was hard back then, difficulty is relative hence why many people have been remembering it differently. Either way, the average player in Classic is going to be a lot better than the average player in Vanilla. So, while private server players may not accurately represent the Classic population, it still stands that the average player will find Classic group content quite easy.
---
The reason we all want to play Classic is because we are chasing the Vanilla experience. We‚Äôre not chasing specific HP, armor, and damage values on mobs. When someone says ‚ÄúI miss long nights of running Deadmines‚Äù, do they mean they miss how VC had exactly 4.1k HP? I doubt it. They miss the challenge of running the dungeon and the accomplishment they felt when they got the loot drop they wanted.
---
It doesn't have to be buffed upwards of 50-100% like in some private servers, but it should be buffed to give the average player the best possible experience.
---
Do you even actually watch Preach anymore? Or this video? Because he's never been ignorant about anything in regards to classic, nor has he "railed" against it. He's always been supportive of it while simultaneously saying that it's probably not for him because he's already done it before.
---
Depends on how you like to play - if you like to be jumpy, shieldy, freezy, instant-damagy - go Mage. If you like to toss up a couple dots then get CC'd and beat on while hoping for an opening to reapply dots before being CC'd again since you can't blink, your only "escape" is on a 2 minute cooldown and you already blew your insta-summon-void-sac for a shield and just like living through a beating then play a Lock.
---
Ok those are really REALLY reduced versions hahaha.
---
Played both in Vanilla, mained a Lock. They are both fairly boring in PvE as is most any class in Vanilla. PvP the Mage definitely requires more buttons to press to outplay someone but when the Warlock is geared you do get kinda lazy because you're pretty much "meh, whatever you do, I'll live. I tossed up some dots and sac'd my pet. I'll be fine after this deathcoil." Not that you don't have to pull moves out your ass sometimes but a majority of players won't be able to kill you 1v1 with just a light dusting of gear unless they severely outgear you.
---
Both are really fun in PvP, meh in PvE. Both are needed in raids and great for PvP.
---
I'd say you can't go wrong with either.
---
Fantastic thanks!
---
Message sent!
---
well, that was the part of the stresstest to get enough traffic for the login server. so if i cant login meanwhile to fullfill the stress they need, i grab some snacks and watch netflix in the meantime. no stress for me, just for blizz win-win i would say
---
What if I don't like fat chicks?
---
I was in 6th grade when a friend got me hooked on WoW (roughly 2006), and I remember going to school and gushing to my friends at lunch that I was fighting wolves with a bow and arrow and even though these wolves were full of arrows, they just kept coming and coming.   
---
Every encounter in Vanilla was part of the adventure. You really did FEEL like you were in a different world that kept turning when you logged off.
---
It doesn't matter if they *actually* are doing less damage than the tanks, it was hyperbole. The point is that they are worse than warr/rogue/mage/warlock, and even "meme" specs like feral druid; all they bring to the table utility/buff wise is SW, but you can get the same thing but better from a PI/SW priest. It's just a fact that they are a suboptimal DPS slot pick, will almost exclusively be taken to fill, and will never be actively recruited by raid groups.
---
That's just the cold hard truth of it. Sucks, I know, I'm planning on maining priest; but that's just life.
---
To be fair that doesn't even matter.
---
You think you do but.....
---
Nevermind.
---
You don't seem to understand the definition of "specialization".
---
I think Classic will be great, I think I'm getting downvoted because people don't accept anything but circle jerking here. 
---
But like if we wanna be real, 90% of all the people coming into Classic will quit the game within the first couple months because of varying issues, and there is a giant list.
---
Im 99% sure this is a joke, but to just for anyone who doesn't know, BC is a province in Canada (British Columbia)
---
Almost like some kind of Role Playing Game. Strange, isn't it?!
---
Interesting. I have friends in the same situation you are in with kids and wives and they are all planning on playing. Different play style. No, there wont be 6 hour grind sessions and such, but they will grind gradually and enjoy the pace of the game. Work with friends and others similar to themselves to experience the raids on weekends.
---
The world of competitive pushing and grinding is dying as people have grown out of that, but the appeal of a REWARDING game is still massive to so many people.
---
I cannot name a game in the past 7-10 years that was half as rewarding as WoW was to accomplish something. Getting that Rep grind done was a feels good moment. Getting that rare as hell world drop, Finally getting a group that can clear Scholo without any difficulty, PVP achievements. Those took more then a week or two. Games released in the past 10 years have been so easy that the "MMO" community that you think is decreasing looses interest.
---
The Mmo community used to like challenges. They still very much so do. Hence why the easymode version that WoW became has lost a majority of its playerbase. 
---
I understand where you are coming from, I just think you are part of a minority of previous WoW players. People with a couple hours a night to play something challenging with goals to work towards will enjoy classic just as much now as they did years ago. Kids that find all the BR and fps snooze fest games boring could easily get drawn into a challenging game.
---
ALSO a side note. The Lore of WoW has not been challenged in my memory. They fully fleshed out so many things in that game. ESO is the closest I can think of. There are tons of people out there that will jump back on board to re live the Lore components.
---
I guess we will have to wait and see how they handle it, but the more I think about it, the more I am thinking that they will just release it with minimal advertising. Once it has been out for a while and the sympathetic people have helped clean up any remaining bugs that Beta does not iron out, then maybe we will see some adds.
---
That's exactly what will happen at launch, so they'll need to know about any issues.
---
Yes being european I expect a higher level of education in people, I'm sorry.
---
I'm just pointing out a flaw and people are like "no no there is no issue" when you can't get around the fact that there has to be a problem if you think about how the system works. You can't have a dynamic layering system with no phasing and no queue. It's impossible.
---
Plus who really has faith in current blizzard to be able to continue the way of vanilla. Like whatever these people are on, probably shouldn't be on it.
---
Rep grinds
---
Collectibles/shiny things to waste time getting
---
Professions (crafting,cooking,fishing)
---
Alts
---
Thats really about all the things to do. Alot of time after 60 you *can* help lowbies and other guildies do their things or torment low levels.
---
Balance is an iffy thing. That being a normal process of a game‚Äôs lifetime, it theoretically should be done but in moderation. Certainly not new skills/spells that make the class play completely different and would cause a cascade of changes that could potentially mess it up. The main things I consider for no changes are obvious things like no flying, LFD/LFR, phasing, blatant dumbing down to make the content way too easy, too many gameplay conveniences, things like that. Things I would be fine with are alternate leveling areas that just give you extra areas to level certain ranges and new dungeon and raid content that doesn‚Äôt add power creep. By no power creep I mean make new Tier and Dungeon sets that still have the same stats as others of the same ‚Äúlevel/tier‚Äù but the only difference is the armor design and maybe set bonuses. This would have the benefit of not adding crazy power creep on new raids increasing characters power level as well as give players more customization options without the transmog system thus retaining class identity.
---
People seem to completely miss the concept of the snowball effect. As soon as your one change is implemented another change is implemented and another and another that "doesn't make sense" or is "too hard".
---
Frankly it if it was up to me I wouldn't even have went so far into the classic patches. I liked Pre-BG/Honor system WoW but I cede to the consensus on this one... but no more plz.
---
Have you ever pvp‚Äò d on a vanilla warlock before lol?
---
..You do realize that ZaaaaaM7 is agreeing with the Beta numbers as being correct, right? Deltex was the one who is trying to say that the dungeons will be adjusted from Beta.
---
Try to make sure you're responding to the right person before you call someone dumb.
---
So... is illidan the head of the mounties? (It was a joke btw)
---
I just played on a pserver and pretended it was beta 
---
Not like I'd report bugs anyways
---
Thats the difference, I use words like "I think" and "I disagree" not "You are stupid for your opinion, there is NO WAY they do this thing in less than 4-5 years"
---
It's unbelievably cathartic to see all these tryhards getting their panties twisted in this thread.
---
60 with max trade skills in the first two weeks.
---
Work on pre-raid bis shortly afterwards, keeping an eye towards Ony and MC.
---
Help other people in guild with stuff as needed.
---
For sure, I can't wait to just be able to farm and have fun - only worried about blizzard not responding to farming but caravans - it's crazy in bfa they are running 24/7
---
Get rid of layering. [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpjl0f/layering\_sucks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpjl0f/layering_sucks/)
---
‚ÄúIt's better to weave shots between auto attacks than just press frostbolt or shadowbolt all evening.‚Äù
---
Not really lol maybe on YouTube, when you get to raid and you realize you can only use 3 aim shots and multi shots before you are out of mana. Then it‚Äôs auto shot. At least you have to press shadow bolt or frost bolt.
---
I totally support this. I'm craving classic, like a meth addict being willing to suck an old nasty dick just for a small rock. But WotLK was my JAM and favorite expansion - and I hope that we end up going the vanilla/tbc/wotlk route, I will support the sh\*t out of the game during TBC even though it's not really one of my favorites.
---
Some find their joy in the Auction House and/or professions to make as much money as they can but other than what has already been mentioned (farming mats/professions/reputation), there is not as much to do as in OSRS if you put it like that.
---
Jenkins?
---
Good one warpbeast
---
Much appreciated, thanks!
---
The best WoW has ever been was during Wotlk - Ulduar, then BC comes second, BC was an amazing expac and if you can't say anything else but "FlYiNg mOUnTs" I can't take you seriously.
---
The impact of it was not as big as it would be right now. To the point that some (not all) did not acknowledge it or even know of the existence. I guess I should have prefaced it like that.
---
All good warlocks pull threat and die gloriously. Screw the healer(s). It's their job to heal. Life-tap &amp; suicide your way to victory!
---
You really only need 20 points in holy with spell crit consumables and adequate gear. A spec like the following can off-tank raid bosses with defense gear and heal a raid just fine on fights where off-tanking utility isn't necessary: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0dbxZVGxI0uVo
---
Sort of. I pulled this from an old thread:
---
&gt; Nost content difficulty was tuned towards retail values. However to compensate, gear/other items were patched onwards from Patch 1.4. Limiting itemization/enchant/buff options for tanks, DPS, and healers, allowing for a more identical experience to original Vanilla. Bosses like Broodlord, Chromaggus and Nefarian had the capability of killing your Main Tank within 1-2 seconds due to unusual damage output, seemingly **stealthily buffed**. Making it a fair challenge in progression with un-defcapped tanks. Invis pots to skip trash was not possible due to dragonkins detecting stealth.
---
&gt; Overall, with the success of Nost - it's popularity being my main metric for this - I think a lot of people got spoiled by the Patch 1.4 style release - artificially **boosting content difficulty** instead of a direct, feenix-like, HP/dmg boost. Has the vanilla private scene moved on from the traditional 1.12 itemization environment and moved towards a pre1.12 emulation style? Why do people continue to defend unbuffed BWL/AQ releases in a 1.12.1 item emulation when it has been proved possible to do?
---
You can see that the added difficulty contributed a lot to the player experience and success of the server. This is where, imo, Classic is currently missing the mark.
---
Priest is quite easy to start with, not that many spells/abilities to keep track of and for a new player it‚Äôs underappreciated how good being able to heal yourself is.
---
Bit negative it seems.... Why the jade? You still playing live? I would imagine that is where the anger comes from.
---
Also, WHY do some many people watch those idiots? The loud mouthed ignorant ones that don't know shit don't get more then 5 seconds of my time before I find another streamer.
---
The thing is, that's not OSRS it's WoW. Maybe it will work maybe it will not. Also it's not Jagex, it's blizzard and activision, epitomes of trust these days.
---
Also in OSRS not everyone agrees on the changes and there is drama as anywhere else. There are people in OSRS that want "true" vanilla OSRS. As the changes accumulate, so will these people. And remember, even if OSRS is considered success among it's players, so was WOTLK for wow. WOTLK was the peak of WoW but it was also it's downfall since it introduced the most hated design changes midway through.
---
Do we simply tell people that want to have a game they know, and can always return to, that it will be changed, to give them time limit before said changes? Do we ignore them? well now... it's a hard question. 
---
Maybe OSRS approach could work, but maybe it will break the game one day. And if you ask me, id rather not rely on a "maybe", but rely on a game that will always be there.
---
It won't ever die  if not changed. Pservers show that, the constant demand for over a decade shows this. In the end, what is people definition of dead game? Seems to me that most of the time it's simply "im bored, therefore dead".
---
My trick for getting through Westfall is to go to Darkshore.
---
ur the only person not understanding stuff here... were u there for vanilla? cause it seems like you think they didnt have a system in place back then?
---
what happened when a server got full and became unplayable? they allowed free transfers off the realm, so people could actually play  
---
what ur essentially saying is those people shouldnt be able to play at all. Blizzard wasnt that stupid back then and their not that stupid now
---
People would try and find were my huter FDed while they were wiping.  I didn't just have to hide from the boss I had to hide from the other raiders. Lets play find the dwarf.
---
I have more memories, but they just weren't apart of the vanilla experience. Vanilla was just a stepping stone for what WoW was going to become.
---
I would do hunter, and get her an mmo mouse. Since she‚Äôs starting new she can learn with the 12 button mouse right from the get go.
---
2 primary, then the 3 secondary.  Fishing, cooking, first aid
---
&gt;  But to just dismiss what OP is saying is not honest.
---
I didn't dismiss him. I answered him directly. Point for point. He was wrong. The numbers ARE correct. I explained this demonstrably and without malice.
---
&gt; NO GEAR THAT EARLY
---
The white gear in the starting zone is huge because of the armor difference. It alone is the difference that could allow multiple mobs or not.
---
My statement is accurate, I went point for point, included far more than just the starting zone data, and provided the concrete evidence to dispute his only point.
---
Again, just to be *abundantly* clear, I did not dismiss anyone. I literally did the opposite. In a thread that is being massively downvoted I took the time to explain the situation, numbers, and actual source of the discrepancy while everyone else is shitting on him. Maybe next time you should recognize that instead of trying to shit on me for doing the exact opposite of what I actually did.
---
Cheers.
---
Pservers often use dynamic respawns. Classic won't. Layering should have a similar effect, but it'll depend how they tune it.
---
Find a raiding guild, get lvl 60 asap, max my professions including fishing and cooking. Make bank and be ready for raiding.
---
First aid too. Do you put looted cloth on the AC for an easy sale or make bandages and level up First Aid? 
---
How will you save enough gold for that lvl 40 mount? So many questions lol
---
Caving to qq of a few players is why we are getting classic servers though
---
you need some reading comprehension, cause ur pretty dumb if you got that from what I wrote.  No they are not being stealth sponsored by blizzard, what I am saying is these streamers are just the kind of people who jump on anything that is popular for money.  If classic beta was not popular and BFA gets them more viewers, you can bet ur ass they are playing BFA.
---
iirc locks were one of the only classes where their ideal raid spec was also very viable in pvp.
---
You can grind and you can grind a lot, the grind will never end. Realistically speaking, there's not much different content indeed.
---
technicality but I agree.
---
I think the biggest issue people are going to have with Classic is thinking the game is all about getting to "end game". Not the case. The journey is the game. Leveling is meaningful, it IS the content. You aren't supposed to rush 60 in one week. 
---
My comment might seem out of left field for your post, but that is why these things are the way they are. If you got a level 60 boost in classic, you would move past 98% of the games content... I worry people are going to see the style of classic and see it as hindering their progress with it being as slow as it is. It is supposed to be that way. You might get a weapon and hold onto it for multiple levels, and that might be a month!
---
If your preference is based off all classes having a place in raids, you should prefer Vanilla over BC/Wotlk.
---
 In Vanilla for both PvE and PvP all classes are part of an optimal raid/premade group, while in BC if you pick a Rogue you have no place in a raid group.. The same is also true of Warriors in Wotlk.
---
in reality, nothing.  wow has essentially been raid (including the build up to raiding) or pvp at max level with some random fluff on the side.  legion onward has m+ adding 5 man dungeons as progression but it all boils down to killing players or killing instanced NPCs.
---
Fair warning, [Heart of Wyrmthalak](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Heart_of_Wyrmthalak) looks to be 1.10. I'm not expecting it until Phase 5.
---
Now if you come across the coefficients of Demonshear and Lifestealing, my Retadin would like a talk with you.
---
My guess is this is something that will be heavily talked about at Blizzcon this year.
---
People want the game in the same exact state forever. But had classic just continued on without a BC expansion, there would have been changes.
---
Never called anyone stupid or ignorant, said if x had y thought then x is crazy.
---
But if you see "crazy" as a devil term - please get some fresh air.
---
My man!
---
&gt; PvP in BC and Wrath was PEAK WoW, Battlegrounds and world pvp are bottom of the barrel aspect of PvP.
---
See below
---
&gt;Arena based PvP is what made PvP in the game popular.
---
&gt;Quite the opposite in my experience
---
According to your opening post, **you were NINE YEARS OLD when you experienced Vanilla**. Excuse me if I don't take the experience of a someone whos [brain is in the pre-adolescent development phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_human_brain#Childhood_and_adolescence) seriously.
---
yall gonna burn out. i stopped at lvl 13

---
This is what hunters can do. Being able to drop off the threat table through feign death, have their pet stay and kite effectively makes them extremely powerful if you can take advantage of enemy pathing. They are a class with a high skill cap and very rewarding when played well. I really like them as a class because their ability to avoid damage through kiting makes them so powerful compared to the more deterministic classes that can't avoid damage.
---
Yeah but I wanna be more than viable in pvp lol, never got into it hard back in the day and want to give it the good ol college try
---
I highly disagree with this. If the tank dies they will Rez with low health and no threat. Much better to Rez your healer and give them mana and a threat reset even if they can‚Äôt Rez others.
---
The dungeons, especially the low level ones, were always easy. The sense of accomplishment and Vanilla experience is still very much there. I am surprised by how much I've enjoyed the beta. 
---
My fun is not predicated on the tuning of the level 30 group content. It feels like it should. No changes.
---
You‚Äôre thinking maybe if 60 water from dm? Doesn‚Äôt that conjure at 2 per?
---
TBC brings arenas and ruins Wpvp
---
Just go play retail....
---
The pve is definitely better. ANd from what i've seen of the pvp it's a joke. They made arenas the primary pvp type but didn't balance the game aroudn them at all. And you do need real balance for a deathmatch like arena without an objective. Otherwise you will get comp stomped over and over
---
We can all roll druid for BC, that will be fun
---
I think Locks are easier than hunters being you only have to worry about soulshards rather than food and ammo. Plus nothing is easier than just dotting things up while the vw goes around
---
Me and around 15-20 IRL friends are all in on Classic, most have never played wow before. It‚Äôs not nostalgia, there‚Äôs crazy hype for Classic around where I live.
---
&lt;Get of Fenris&gt; - Horde - NA West - PvP Server - Mediumcore
---
**What‚Äôs it mean?**:
---
‚ÄúFenrir‚Äù or ‚ÄúFenris‚Äù is the big bad wolf god from Norse mythology who bites off Tyr‚Äôs hand (ring some bells?), straight-up kills Odin, and casually ushers in Ragnarok aka the apocalypse. The word ‚Äúget‚Äù in noun form means: an offspring or the total of the offspring. Thus ‚ÄúGet of Fenris‚Äù translates roughly into ‚Äúthe children of the wolf god who brings about the end times‚Äù.
---
**Our Philosophy**:
---
Despite our scary name (meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Alliance) The culture is a peaceful gaming environment free of bigotry and general ‚Äúgamer rudeness‚Äù and one in which mistakes are expected to be corrected with regards to guild events such as raiding or PvP premades. Most of us are older than your typical gamer at this point in our lives, and we demand maturity from our members, you know - like how people expect one to act in the real world.
---
**So what about loot and stuff?**:
---
We will be using a EPGP point system for loot distribution and priority. The system rankings for loot priority will be charted on our webpage for transparency. EPGP is superior to DKP for many reasons that a quick google search will tell you. Certain BiS (Best-in-Slot) items from 40-man raids may have pre-requirements to purchase with EPGP. The MT will be loot counseled items during all progression.
---
**What Gets us apart**:
---
We have a built-from-the-ground-up donation system where players may contribute materials and consumables to the guild bank to gain EP and raise their loot priority. This allows top performers an edge, and those who may be busy with life to still have access to end-game consumables if they were unable to farm them. It also provides the guild bank income which will be passed down to our raids. Do you like free enchants? So do we.
---
PvP has always been a passion of many of our members, as such ***we will have an in-house bounty system for world PvP in which players can earn EP for the collection of ‚Äúscalps‚Äù (screenshotted 1v1 or 2v2 kills of bounty targets listed on our webpage).*** This gives incentive for higher level players to assist lowbies just trying to level who may be getting camped (PvP server), and allows for hardcore PvPers to gain some loot priority in raids. Plus we think it‚Äôs cool.
---
A lot of guilds will tell you they encourage a mature playing environment, and they are likely being truthful. Few guilds actually achieve this, but do trust it is a top priority for us so that we may all enjoy our hobby. During raids we demand focus, but we also know how to have fun. We never allow bigotry to go unchecked, and although we sometimes disagree, we respect everyone in and out of guild. We do not brag of our successes, and we believe recognition is achieved through action. Many of us have known each other for going on 15 years or longer and we have already have a strong community. We really look forward to starting a new chapter on Classic and hope we‚Äôre a good fit for you!
---
**A Brief History**:
---
GoF has been a gaming community since 2004 with several hundred members over many MMOs in as many years. We started on Vanilla WoW, achieved a lot of end-game raiding and PvP success, and generally played the game like few then could.
---
**Raid Times**:
---
TBD but likely evenings during the week, and early day during weekends (to allow for night activities IRL)
---
**Guild Priorities**:
---
Raiding 40-man content (3 days weekly) and PvP (When not raiding. Premades and 20-man content will be ran on non-raid days).

Drop us a line and let‚Äôs talk Classic! Our server is already very active with players getting ready.Not playing Horde? Ask about our IRL friends who are rolling Alliance and are good solid raiders. Even though we‚Äôre gonna like, gank them and stuff.
---
&gt; if they want to care about being able to clear all the content in the game, then they're going to be a player that researches the game realistically speaking.
---
I don't think you understand how your average player approaches video games. No one fucking researches a video game before playing it. They play the game, pick a class and play. Now if they for some odd reason chose to play a druid and don't like healing they're going to have to re-level if they ever want to play in a raid.
---
What a shock to see JUST character names.
---
The only things that will limit the development of a classic raider.io (or similar tool) will be the following:
---
1) Whether or not Blizz implements an armory for Classic.
---
2) What information is included on this armory. Will raid boss kills be tracked?
---
3) The caring of the tools developers. They may not care to bother with Classic, and keep to just retail.
---
All of the issues you listed that fail to properly evaluate someone‚Äôs performance are issues that persist through retail now. But a tool to give an evaluation of your experience is actually quite big, which is the main function of raider.io.
---
Having to have people come and be inspected holds the issue of ‚Äúwhat if this person is amazing, but hasn‚Äôt gotten lucky with loot from raids where the drops are severely limited for the massive numbers in the group?‚Äù
---
There‚Äôs no perfect system, and people that want to just shit on raider.io‚Äôs flaws need to realize every system has massive flaws. Many of the arguments of r.io‚Äôs failing fall through for nearly every system.
---
I think a compromise is in order.
---
Switching specs on the fly isn't good, but a 50g cost isn't good either, since it punishes certain classes more than others.
---
Reduce it to something more reasonable like a 10g or 20g cap or quicker cap reduction times.
---
That way you still have to be in town to respec but it doesn't require you to spend hours doing something you don't like just to play the content you do like.
---
Clap
---
They changed the way combat worked at some point to prevent rezing during a fight. People feign death on private servers to dodge a death but I'm starting to wonder if that will even be possible?
---
Doesn't matter that much I guess. Just the odd repair and run back. Maybe a jumper cable here or there to speed things up.
---
A) "Uh you don't have to do this so you can't argue it's bad" Shit argument, try again.
---
b) I don't want blizzard to specifically cater to me. I gave my OWN example to prove that there's genuine reason to want a low respec cost, I can do just fine without it myself, but I still think it's healthier for the game that there's a balance on the respec cost were it's affordable, but not negligible and I think the balance is 25g, and it would make the game much more fun to play for everyone.
---
The same reply we got when we asked for Vanilla. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you remember how bad it was‚Äù
---
Warlocks are the best pve class late game and best pvp class 1v1 hands down
---
Just have links to the route ready to hand to them.
---
Longarms was Grand Marshall forever. He basically did BGs all day. I had heard rumours that the account was played by multiple people and others that he was retired and had lots of time. No idea what the truth was, but he made it very hard to get Grand Marshall on Earthen Ring.
---
Yes there were addons for pretty much everything including Tooltip enhancements, character mining(starting with census and moving on the mining gear, ect...), auction, mail, timers, super customizable Unit frames, map coords, gathering node trackers, damage meters, boss mods, bag/bank, combat text,ect....
---
The latest mod to come about in Vanilla was Threat meters.  Super analytical damage meters with graphs,ect... and things like pawn evolved in tbc IIRC but more bare versions existed for a long time in Vanilla.  I didn't play the last 5 months or so leading up to TBC so I may be wrong there.
---
Our server, Kil'jaeden, being down half the time when we tried to get our MC raid together. I swear it was the only server in vanilla since launch that consistently went down! It got better during BWL and was fine after AQ.
---
Seriously though, during our BWL raiding days we had probably 90% of our core group of officers, one of which had our sole Thunderfury, all of a sudden leave the guild. We didn't want to throw away all of our progress, so some of the older members stepped up and we kept the guild going through AQ40 and is still going to this day.
---
Hunter  100%
---
Thanks for expanding on that.  I'm mostly in agreement.
---
To me, that's what Vanilla was all about. Taking your sweet ass time to level, exploring everywhere, and making up your own fun along the way. It was a lot of fun just screwing around and doing dumb (read fun) stuff. You meet a lot of people that way as well.
---
I am holding out hoping they do another ad campaign with celebs like they did back in the day. Not alot just a few around release to get the word out.
---
You still choose a path and not good at everything if there's 25gold respecs. I'm not arguing that we should haev duel spec or free respecs, I'm simply saying that 25gold is a better balance between "chosen path" as you call it, and being able to afford respecs when needed.
---
Yea as long as you aren‚Äôt spending tons of gold on it, to the point where you can‚Äôt get your mount at 40
---
Sorry must be confusing for you, don't just open a window... actually go outside.
---
Grab a vest with a bunch of pockets and take a hike.
---
1g for a portal what i grew up on
---
You're allowed two primary professions but as many secondary professions as you want. Secondary professions include fishing, cooking, and first aid. Fishing/Cooking can be quite lucrative in terms of making gold, as can most of the primary professions.
---
If me playing a video game is enough to make her bolt, then so be it.
---
i cant wait for the leveling experience again.  I level 8 toons during Wrath but still played during BC.  Looking forward to talent trees too
---
Just what was the rationale behind that?
---
And yet none of them will have last stand. For some reason.
---
Or the other way around, where it turns out people actually liked the changes TBC brought.
---
Well, I gotta say I admire your dedication.
---
Yeah but if people read things they may be end up being informed(imagine being informed LUL) which prevents them from complaining about shit that has already been explained.
---
How did that alliance 3rd from the top get 7k bonus honor when no one else even got close?
---
Can't argue with an idiot. Keep talking about rock paper scissors lmao.
---
Going to go out on a limb and say it was the years of vindictive shitposting by retail normies that soured relations between the two communities.
---
Yeah, but you can get your dicked sucked for a couple months, and you also have classic.
---
But yeah otherwise you are right.
---
Dont worry, I'll give him water
---
In cases like that, it's best if the guild leader or someone similar plays the tank or the tank is an RL friend.
---
Yikes!!!! I don't remember it being that long but certainly makes sense.
---
Not while tanking. If your healer leaves though, you can just switch over to healing if you find a tank faster than a healer. They are very flexible that way where warriors are pigeoned into one role.
---
Reminds me of when people were crying that dagger rogues were useless and only swords were any good. Then got reck'd by my dagger build and wondered what my spec was.
---
&gt;&gt;I think it wouldn't
---
&gt;Let's just be perfectly clear: You have no way of knowing that, at all. Which is why it should never be implemented.
---
Thats weird.  It almost like they said they *think* it wouldnt, not that they know it wouldnt....
---
They're a solid class. It is true that in raids they will eventually be outperformed by rogues, warlocks, mages, and warriors once you get past  tier 2 content. However, as others have said this doesn't matter unless you're in a hardcore speedrunning guild that is trying to shave off every second in a raid. 
---
That said, they still bring utility to raids and are valuable for kiting and pulling. Also their rotation is more engaging than frostbolt/shadow bolt ad nauseum. 
---
In PvP, they are very strong. If you get the jump on someone in 1v1 you will win most of the time if you can avoid getting hit. There is also the benefit of your range protecting you from the front lines, so you can rack up HKs in AV from afar. However, you do have to mind the 8yd range deadzone. Learn how to kite people and use feign death to lay traps in combat. You will have to utilize macros to use your frost/freezing traps with Feign death effectively, as well as control your pet so that it doesn't break your traps accidentally in combat. 
---
You and your pet will also shred clothies, which is nice. Beware frost mages and warlocks with curse of exhaustion. You can kite melee classes to victory as long as you don't get hit. Keep your distance and keep moving, and you'll be fine.
---
Rogues and Warriors are the most picked because they are by far the best at their role.
---
If by "viable" you're okay with being half as effective as a Rogue or Warrior and potentially being last in line for loot because of this, then I guess.
---
I'm all for telling people to play what they want to play, but I also don't want to see people invest weeks or months into a character that they're ultimately disappointed with.
---
You get water breathing pots like in the 1-10 area bank them! They will come back around in the arathi Highlands  cove quests.
---
You act like the Defias didn't drop bandanas every rogue wanted to wear.
---
I remember going to Westfall on my Troll Rogue just to farm one.
---
Do you have any reasons why it isn‚Äôt good for the game? Just curious, I dont necessarily disagree with what you‚Äôve said, just interested in knowing why you think it‚Äôs bad for the game
---
I'm saying class balance equates to player engagement, if classes aren't balanced in classic and Blizzard doesn't take any steps to make underpowered classes any better than they were 15 years ago we're gonna see a MASSIVE wave of players quitting the game after spending 30+ hours of time into leveling just to find out they're not going to get invites to guilds because the class they chose is only optimal as a healer or only optimal to bring 1/40 to a raid for their buffs. 
---
There is no reason to play a class or spec thats unbalanced in classic unless you literally DO NOT CARE AT ALL about end game. Thats fine if you don't but sometimes players change their minds, they level up and have a fun experience and want to experience a raid now, but can't get in because "srry we don't take X cause they're weak".
---
If Blizzard doesn't take a proactive stance on Class balance in Classic this shit will flop in a couple of months. Its been like this for every single expac from BC onwards, each had their problems but if the expansion was great, it didn't matter if the classes weren't fun to play.
---
Thanks, I've been going back and forth forever, this scales the weight towards trying out Shaman more seriously!
---
Im interested in the System requirements anyone have information for that?
---
Enjoy the game.
---
Oh some guy convinced me it would be less of a time sink in a 1 years time to just switch specs, so my dedication has waned.
---
Apparently you don't understand what scaling means you knob.
---
&gt;Well, early on in Elwynn you get a 5 use item that lets you reduce the armor of your target by 50%
---
Aren't these the candles that can be used on rogues that also keep them from stealthing?
---
I have wondered how feasible it would be to have everything set up where they can have servers that allowed up to every expansion. Not sure how it would work, but an interesting though. Say maybe a server is layered with every expansion where you are on the same server as everyone but only see and interact with those running under the same expansion and when you select which server you want you also tick off what expansion you want to play under and it has snapshots of characters under each expansion. Again no idea how well this would actually work, but would be an amazing innovation if they could make it work.
---
Hunters can do that too if they get deterrence.
---
The 3 day long AV‚Äôs have got to be one of the things I miss MOST about Vanilla.
---
Why can‚Äôt they be like that on retail. Seriously, this is far more engaging than what we‚Äôve been used to.
---
AR?
---
Checking your history, seems his spidey sense is spot on.
---
RP Flair = best flair &lt;3
---
Staysafe got to level 16 in 8 hours on stream and he wasn‚Äôt even speeding that much, so it could be possible
---
I was wondering that too
---
&gt;that explains also why the mobs do less damage everywhere.
---
This has been disproved.
---
Nothing else but grind.  
---
That's why ill mostly be raid logging and maybe farming gold/mats for 1 day.
---
As someone who actually likes the goofy new tauren models I wish they'd leave in some sort of cvar command to flip that switch. keep it out of the options menu but let those of us who *really* want it to be able to.
---
Yeah, I was also a glad during BC at the age of 13. Is your argument going to seriously be about age?
---
I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but they already fixed this in Vanilla: PVE servers.
---
They did keep people wrangled.  30-40 Hoggers guarding perimeters and the like
---
I know i like the playstyle And that im not gonna top the dps meters but im worried about reaching lvl 60 And be left out of raiding
---
It seems like gnome is more popular among higher-end players but dwarves are also great.
---
Just didn't like the quest lines available.
---
Ony attunement and epic mount. Pre raid bis near 50% complete.
---
You do get less and less honor for killing other players, eventually you get nothing. Back in the day there were addons for tracking who you've killed and how many times that day.
---
I will be using this and forcin- uh.. i mean.. gently coercing my friends to do the same ;)
---
Thanks man, this is awesome!!
---
Yes, no changes outside from vanilla lifespan. Everyone knows there were a lot of patches. It sounds like you don't know what you are talking about or are just a troll if this fact just hit you.
---
Thankfully you can hide them.
---
Haha yeah, they best looking cloak from vanilla i think is the Stoneskin Gargoyle Cape, because its white, and longer than your average cloak or cape.
---
But not as fast as your fingers...
---
Since you have access to Beta, can you test if Curse of Agony does damage to stealthed rogues? My memory was that it required vision of the target for it to do damage. So if the target vanished or ran out of view distance, it would stop doing damage entirely.
---
What I was seeing most often was fury 2hander for pvp. Sure you lack mortal strike but its still viable just like feral resto is not optimal but viable for pvp.
---
I don't think that's at all what he's alluding too. More so the mechanics and daily grind required. I don't personally think any sort of change is going to happen but I can see why he's suggesting this.
---
&gt;To be clear I am not making this post to hate on streamers or people that play 16 hours a day. I don't think they are being dicks. The system actually kinda demands you behave like that to advance. So I would blame the system more then the player.
---
I get what you mean but r13 is for a select group of people.
---
Getting rid of those things (no matter how dumb it small it is) is what leads to BFA - and this is coming from someone that won't ever see r13 even though I would love to farm for it.
---
Lol, you are only proving me right by continuing to be a toxic pos. Cheers mate
---
Completing your dungeon Set 1 and 2 will occupy plenty of your time!
---
I LOVE tbc, I love the idea of fixing specs.
---
Dual spec isn't fixing specs, dual spec is giving up on fixing specs.
---
Yeah, no one gives a flying fuck about Wpvp lmfaooo. Wpvp was a joke and still is, the fact you're building your hype around a non-existent mode is unfathomable. 
---
Enjoy chasing people in classic and camping them at the GY.
---
blizzard doesnt seem to have plans to revert chat to vanilla standards, as now classic wows chat will be using the new battle.net chat integration.
---
Same. I think I might run through classic raids as my BFA toon though just to get reminded of the layouts.
---
It doesn't demand them to camp, they can just go to the next game, and if you think about mentioning queue times remember this is beta
---
I'm going to go warrior, but I'm not sure if I should go female or male orc. I think I like the female models more because they aren't as chunky, but I'm not sure exactly. What do you guys think about female orc warrios vs male orc warriors?
---
Bullshit lol. Beta Classic is about having fun, because it's inherently meaningless long term. WoW has always been a grind.
---
You could always farm gold with your guild and world PvP at the same time. Farming E‚Äôko in winterspring with friends and killing other players was always pretty fun for me. Or grinding twilight sets in silithus while battling for the spawn points, I remember that pretty well. The game isn‚Äôt only BG‚Äôs and raids, if you‚Äôre looking for that gameplay, BFA exists.
---
They have PVE servers for you
---
You can tank or heal any of the pre raid content as 30/21 easily If you aren‚Äôt a potato in greens
---
You realize the honor system is set up to discourage camping right?
---
There's a quest in Sen'jin village for very early level Orcs and Trolls. Just out of the newbie area. It rewards [Really Sticky Glue](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4941/really-sticky-glue) and it is the only thing like it in the game. Save it for level 60. Whether you use it for max level PvP or raiding, it has no equal. 
---
The same goes for [Bag of Marbles](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1191/bag-of-marbles) From Elwynn, and [Slumber Sand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3434/slumber-sand) from Tirisfal Glades.
---
Teldrassil and Dun Morogh both have items that don't scale, so feel free to use those. And Mulgore doesn't have anything, really.
---
Even if you're max level from a different zone. Go get these items. They work (or should if classic is truly accurate) on raid bosses.
---
&gt; The only reasonable course of action is to use the authentic numbers.
---
Well it's going to be boring as fuck. Trust me when your green geared tank in MC can tank both giants.
---
The point is you'll have a harder time getting away with this now. Because everything is undeniable more competitive than back then.
---
Well I plan on playing 16 hours a day. I will be the predator not the prey. I'm just saying the system shouldn't demand of me that I camp people. Killing allies is it's own reward.
---
Yeah they're real good in mc, decent in bwl, meh in aq, and bottom tier in naxx. The very definition of "does not scale well".
---
very happy also don't care what you hope
---
It would make sense considering I don't change my opinion based on community complaints :)
---
When does it launch? (Sorry I have been out of the loop) I saw on stream level cap is 30, is that for beta classic or something? When does the official vanilla wow launch with 60 cap? Also, you just need normal wow sub to play?
---
the thing WoW has done threw the year has been done in the fear of excluding people or people getting activly exluded when that is just how social behaviors work and that is what WoW is built on.
---
people are too afraid to group up and chat with randos while leveling so they stop playing we must fix this by making leveling totally a solo experiance rather than optionally co-op. people get kicked from dungeons since they aren't good enough we must fix this by nerfing leveling dungeons. people are getting shunned by the server they are on and are stoping to play and unsubbing we must fix this by making LFG and LFR with cross-realm so every body is a 1 time rando. etc. etc.
---
all of this guarding and ensuring solo and shunned players ruined WoW.
---
Once BGs are out you wont see anyone trying to get HWL for a couple months, because they'll be in BGs (mostly WSG) all the time.
---
That said, I do think they should change the system to spread out across multiple kinds of content, like each BG separately, world PvP, and faction leader kills.  Rather than raw honor per week to determine ranks, use some combination of ranking within each category.
---
Nameplates shouldn't reveal players who aren't in your line of sight. It's such a huge advantage that breaks immersion.
---
IIRC = If I Recall Correctly
---
IRC is obsolete because of the many better platforms like discord.
---
Questing.
---
&gt; Warlocks are the best pve class late game
---
&gt;best pvp class 1v1 hands down
---
tru
---
Guessing you main a druid? Because most classes are not going to be able to get away from a player that puts 10x the amount of effort into the game.
---
Warlock: 3 curses, 2 corruptions, imp. shadowbolt, shadowburn = 7
---
Mage: Winter's Chill OR Ignite, Fireball, and Scorch = 1 or 3
---
Hunter is fastest leveling class, easiest to learn, but among the hardest to master. If others opinions matter to you more than playing the class that interests you most, pick something else. I'd suggest you go with what seems most fun
---
NO! We must gatekeep Classic even more than it already has been!
---
You were 9 and playing with clickers bro, the people who were doing world progression in vanilla were clcikers
---
YOu've never played a game with real wpvp lol
---
TBC is limited action set bullshit because the plebs coudln't bind their keys on their vanilla frames, hahahah. Tha'ts why they added arena. To be a god in vanilla PvP requires 100+ binds and you can't flow chart that out. 
---
WoW took a deeeeeep dive after Vanilla. And never recovered.
---
THe % of the people who ever saw naxx sealed the game design's fate. Once the devs saw that, game just ever more casual. And it was already very casual relative to the MMO's that came before
---
You were a small child when this all happened, trust me boi. I know better than you. Hahaha
---
Hunter is looked at as a noob class because so many people play them poorly. However, its one of the higher skill capped classes in PvE.
---
Offering advice = toxic. My bad "mate", cheerio!
---
This is such a stupid argument. Imagine being a level 50 warrior with a 60 mage sitting on your body? In what world or scenario do you get away?
---
Well if you plan it right your character should be fine. I looked at the Night Elf starting zone and you should be in mostly mail greens with the exception of a couple of grays and no helmet by the time you are level 20 due to quest rewards. I think that's more than a good start for any warrior or paladin tank.
---
The only way I can see it going wrong is if a player picks the wrong quest rewards like leather or cloth then decides to tank at 18.
---
CC will depend on everyone's gear If dps are weak then you will need to CC or the healer will OOM. If the tank is in cloth then yeah you'll need to CC. If the healer has +0 Int from items you'll need to CC.
---
If you go in at the right level for the dungeon or slightly higher and you gather all your quest greens then your groups should be fine.
---
Thank you.
---
Wish I wasn't so competitive. I can't get enjoyment if I don't try hard or beat someone in some way üòÖ
---
dont play with turbo autists and you wont have problems
---
I mean it's worse on the beta test because people don't have mounts. How is a level 30 warrior supposed to escape from a hunter/druid combo without a mount? They'll just track you and chase you down.
---
Just play a private server till launch
---
The odd repair...I guess you haven't played plate or mail characters? It's super expensive.
---
&gt; We already know where this shit leads which is why i dont know why ppl want it.
---
You are comparing 15 years or design decisions under hundreds of developers and numerous lead developers across the history of WoW to the state of the current game. 
---
With that said each layer, in its intended form is effectively 1 server and you may very well have 2-3 layers on a high pop realm making it a massive server because at the end of the day there is going to be falloff with how many players are on live.
---
Would you rather Blizzard has server transfers to low pop realms when this happens? As someone who played in Vanilla and had a large influx of users from Bleeding Hollow come over to Crushridge I can say with absolute confidence that having hundreds, maybe thousands, of random BH players come over did not positively impact our server  community.
---
Stop treating Blizzard like they're the enemy. Sharding isn't even remotely close to layering and clearly a number of issues we are seeing with layering right now are obviously bugs. If you don't like that layering will be in the game at all - that's fine - go play on a private server. They aren't just going to have people sit in 10 hour queues and end up with 3000 people in every starting zone making the game unplayable for days or possibly weeks because that doesn't positively impact the game either.
---
Probably the constant ganking
---
I think it's 5 times. Adding in the GY walk back. You are prolly talking about losing a half hour to someone farming you. The biggest hope I have to avoid this. Would be a "target rich environment." God I hope its a target rich environment lol.
---
There are noobs and masters in each class. There are viable in demand raid specs for each class. There are PvP gods and utter HK farms for each class.
---
Play what you want or you will regret it.
---
Any idea why Senn got so much bonus honor (compared to everyone else)
---
I think you're underestimating the amount of stealth buffs applied by servers like Nost. For one, it was significantly more difficult than K. But I guess we'll have to wait and see.
---
Either way, the average player in Classic will absolutely be better than the average player in Vanilla, so unless difficulty is tuned, the average player experience (aka. Vanilla experience) will be significantly altered.
---
I'm just not sure adjusting the system to not demand you camp people. Is going to make the servers explode into BFA but, I do respect your opinion on #nochanges.
---
Rogue main, typically play Alliance, rolling UD Priest for Classic. Both PVP/PVE
---
Specs mattered before you had damage meters, the meters just pointed out who was carrying and who was being carried.
---
&gt; To be a god in vanilla PvP requires 100+ binds and you can't flow chart that out.
---
You can't imagine how much I'm laughing right now... Holy fuck that was a great laugh.
---
I don't think dual spec is the right way either. The guy you responded to, talks about hybrids being pigeon-holed into playing maybe 1 spec, because the 2 other are garbage in PvE, which is mostly true. And the usual mentality to justifying that is that hybrids can't be good at everything, which is what I got from your post. While TBC literally showed the opposite. All specs were somewhat viable in PvP and PvE and it didn't fuck over pure DPS classes.
---
yes, you had to of been subbed to be invited. its too late now to get an invite
---
It was a rogue and i believe he got into the 20s. He got so much attention people started following him around protecting him for a bit haha.
---
Edit: Or 10s
---
Based on all the surveys, there will be more shamans than rogues and warriors.
---
The only way an enchancement shaman gets a raid slot is if they're buying the slot or running Nightfall. And that's ONE slot per raid.
---
Of course they would. But wouldn't you prefer to have a second option just in case rather than the redunancy of an ankh and a SS on the same char?
---
I thought 'grey' quest EXP was reduced for players, which would turn the exp -&gt; gold formula into different values than what you would find on various DB sites.
---
I'd ask a lvl 30 player to go back and do a starting zone quest and compare the gold rewards.
---
No problem, always happy to help the lower IQ players
---
Just play dude
---
It has a cooldown...
---
A lot of people would still be opposed to that for a few reason,s, mostly the fact that they don't like other people seeing them as something else than them.
---
Some people REALLY hate the new models, I just dislike the jarring nature of MINECRAFT 4K TEXUTRE PACK in 360p world.
---
Man...the rpg elements of vanilla and all the old stuff really made this game enjoyable!
---
Because it's an RPG, we don't just want cookie cutter characters, we want the ability to customize our game through our characters. Customization needs choices, and for choices to matter there must be tradeoffs.
---
What happens when people can flop back and forth with specs as they need is that you see a massive homogenization. Everybody in raid is the same spec, everybody in BGs are the same spec.
---
When you have permantent-ish choices, those choices become a part of your character identity. You get known as a dedicated raid healer or dedicated flag runner because you committed to that spec, you're not just replaceable with any other random druid.
---
A warrior can go all in on pvp 31/20, or they can go mullet spec and be better prepared to OT for their guild while still being a decent pvper, or they can go pure fury dps and learn to adapt their play style to pvp as a fury. Even within a pure fury spec, maybe you pick up some nice pvp talents like imp zerker rage and and imp execute, or you max out your dps by putting 5 points into imp DW.
---
Dual spec releases the pressure valve of limitation that drives creativity in specs, and that creativity is part of what lets the player emotionally invest in their character leading to a better RGP experience.
---
He was in the bg for each objective I think. Most people probably were not in the bg for 19 hours.
---
&gt; I want to see an end of Classic progression where I won't have to constantly be freaking out about leveling/gearing as fast as I can before the next content patch comes out.
---
You should look towards playing games like ESO or Guildwars2.
---
WoW is all about that gear progression, if they don't release TBC you'll have nothing to do.
---
No, the reason it will not happen like this is because they will use the later version of AV and not the early version like in the screenshot.
---
Idk but it sure felt like that. 
---
I just hope they figured out the problem from last time or just let everyone in.
---
They didn't have enough healers or the tanks sucked or both.
---
Ahh okay then. I said 58ish because personally I wasn't abundantly decked out in healing gear the time I was leveling. Definitely was crap gear compared to the spriest spec I was running.
---
We've seen lots of mistakes on private servers though, plenty "bugs" reported on classic, cause it's not the way it is on private servers.
---
The second post is a comment on the formula used in Vanilla, it was posted early in TBC.  
---
How do they calculate weapon skill on private servers btw?
---
Yeah, unfortunately, OP doesn't get it, as evident by his other posts :D
---
Dope! ty
---
It's not 50g. It's 100g. You also have to respec back before the next week. 100g weekly just to enjoy the game outside of raiding is not sustainable.
---
Na i think Arena sucked. PvP tournaments were popular years before BC.
---
you vote with your dollar
---
I mean... just because people who also have no idea what they are talking about agree with you doesn't make you right. You're one of the very many people who are gonna have a rough time in classic wow if you even stray into it. You'll get into your first dungeon and shit yourself cause you can't get pass the first few packs of mobs without dying several times. Keep thinking retail is hard. Keep thinking that. Its people like you, that watered down this game and maybe it as easy as it is.
---
The quicker you get to 60 the faster you gain access to lucrative gold making opportunities, not to mention a jump start in gearing and maxing professions and all that.
---
If he clutches a goblin jumper cable and saves the raid its fine.
---
Wrong user
---
"My shaman buddy was 30 Ele 21 Resto"
---
His raid grp is still waiting for the Mana Tide Totem :DDD
---
How behind are you going to be if you take an extra week to level to 60? Well, you'll potentially be one week behind...
---
Fear Ward &gt; All other priest racials. That's the min/max competitive opinion. 
---
The truth? Play what you want, fuck everyone else and their try hard opinions. You pay your subscription, it's your game to play how you want. Play and elf, play a human. Play what you like, it's an RPG.
---
By far the worst repair bills in the history of the game, consumable farming being way more necessary for tanks than any other role, juggling aggro on AoE pulls for people that can't seem to notice which trash mob you're attacking, dealing with idiots that pull aggro and immediately start a marathon back to SW/Org instead of just sidestepping towards you, having to respec every time you want to do serious farming or PvPing and sometimes having to use puny daggers with a shield which just looks (and feels) ridiculous  
---
In return you get quick PuGs, first dibs on gear (assuming you're the leader), your BiS doesn't look like a clownsuit (see Fury BiS) and get to be at the front when they take the kill photo. You might look powerful in that new armor, but that Wrath helmet hides the face of a tired, broken player that just wants to LOG OUT AND HAVE SOME FUCKING SHUTEYE ALREADY.
---
you wont fall behind. leveling through classic will take a while, enjoy the journey.
---
2 weeks behind the spergs? You wont be behind. There are people who will never make it and people who will take months. Getting there in the first month is really good for the average person
---
AFAIK the only behavior that's different is sitting to trigger enrage procs. The talent is pretty straight forward - get crit, do more damage.
---
The benefit of the fury tree is that the talents actually help you generate more threat. If you take a look at the protection tree, anything past defiance and last stand doesn't really help you tank bosses better. The only valuable talent could be imp. shield wall, but it's very situational and you have to invest a lot of talents to get it.
---
A tank's job has shifted from "I'm going to take as little damage as possible" to "I'm going to generate as much threat as possible while being able to stay alive." It's the healer's job to make sure the tank lives, not the tank's job. Obviously you don't want your tank in devilsaur and shit, but you get the idea.
---
The fury tree gives you a ton of talents to generate more threat.
---
**Dual-Wield Specialization** - More damage = more threat
---
**Flurry** - Increased attack speed = more threat and rage
---
**Enrage** - More damage = more threat
---
**Deathwish** - Believe it or not, tanks will pop this on fights like Vael and Fankriss where raid damage is super high and they need to build threat quickly. Also useful as a fear break
---
**Bloodthirst** - Generates decent threat and you're able to use it on CD.
---
With this spec you are pretty much able to spam heroic strike, while doing your normal rotation of revenge, sunder and bloodthirst.
---
Those charts are extrapolated from **LIVE** 1.12 logs.  Not PServers.
---
It's the "exclusivity" that makes classic what it is.
---
Not everyone can do everything and that's why nobody plays mmorpgs today- they give access to everything to everyone.
---
I get what you mean about it's kind of a "dumb" or  not so fleshed out way to have to get to r13 but idk what they could do differently besides making it easier to achieve.
---
you could just do it with a macro pretty easily
---
This is actually explained in the wolf heart novel. the night elf mages keep to their own and are still not liked by the rest of society and are actively getting killed off in the book by their own kind.
---
Learn the mog of anything you get from Classic to retail. It's stupid and lame but that's me.
---
Ohhhh that quest!!!!!!!! That's the elite quest  in Arathi Highlands Stormgrade Keep ahhhhhh!!!!. Or possibly the elite quest in redridge mountains at Stonewatch keep. You know classic was something when all you have to do is post a pic and you just knew.
---
There are other games????
---
Optimally human for pve.
---
Gnome for pvp.
---
I have a heart vs head conundrum myself with orc and ud. Ultimately I'll end up going with my head
---
Decide what's important to you. Looking how you want. Or the peace of mind that comes with picking the most optimal race for your play preference. I knew if I went for looks, the dps left on the table would eat at me
---
Layering is the option to combat this, do people not understand?
---
Just a question for the characters, you just can create for the name but can't level right?
---
Eh worry about that if we ever get there, no point in fretting over what the server state will be 3+ years down the line.
---
Are there any food recipes that give you buffs besides stam and spirit, while leveling?
---
The honor system *discourages* camping.
---
&gt;[The amount of honor awarded for killing any person gradually decreases if you kill him repeatedly within a 24-hour window. This is the reason why long Alterac Valley battles, which can result in excess of 1000 Honorable Kills in the matter of 5 hours, yield relatively meager amounts of Honor. Participating in many short Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin games against different opponents is probably the fastest way to gain Honor. For each kill the gained honor decreases with 10%. For example an unranked player gains 160 honor on the first kill, second kill is 144, third kill 128, 112, 98, 80, 64, 48, 32, 16 and the 11th kill gains no honor.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0\)#Trivia)
---
This is going to depend on your goals. 
---
Do you want to to enjoy the leveling process and go to all available content as you level?
---
Do you want to be the first wave into raiding? 
---
Those would dictate your journey. If you don't view it as a goal to be on the first wave of raiding then take your time and level. If you MUST be first wave then you'd best hurry to 60. There is no wrong way to play.
---
&gt;They clearly got the message from the latest expansion tanking sub #s lower than ever, and bleeding more like a stuck pig. Lost 6M active users in the last 6 months.
---
Right, but I think time has proved time and time again, that they can rebound from that. They lost the most subscribers in the fastest amount of time with WoD, then a couple years later, BFA becomes their fastest selling expansion ever.
---
&gt;There is a reason they haven't released sub #s after Cata.'
---
They release sub #s after Cata, they stopped during WoD.
---
&gt;Their golden goose is dying, and with nothing on the horizon it makes sense to back classic for all it's worth.
---
Right, but Classic is Classic. They're not going to make money off expansion sales with Classic which is what half their resources are always making.
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm going to play and enjoy both.
---
um its beta?
---
&gt; If/when they go to TBC, we can assume they'll copy your character state to a new server with TBC enabled and keep vanilla separate.
---
I doubt it. More likely is that EVERY server goes to TBC and a few fresh Vanilla servers pop up for those that want to start over and stay frozen in time. You won't be able to transfer your characters to these servers.
---
I also definitely recommend The Shattering.  Honestly any of Golden's books are a good idea.
---
Not having beta will be better for us in the long term - use this time to do things you won't do in September and october.
---
Playing like streamers is unrealistic.
---
I swapped to tank for the beta as I was running into a bunch of groups that just couldn't find one.
---
The best thing I've found is just stack a crap ton of spirit and be very conservative with spell casts. I don't seem to have too much of a problem with threat so I often just auto-attack for 20 seconds to get that mana regen rolling.
---
Never use conc. on a single target unless you are in dire straights. You're dropping 235 mana on 120 damage compared to seal/judgement which is 132 mana for 90 damage. If you have two targets I find just dropping it once, judging the kill target, refreshing seal then auto attacking will get you through a fight with plenty of mana to spare. 
---
On a similar note, abuse those party tools and put that skull up one what target you're going to be slapping off the start. The less you need to worry about dealing with juggling threat across multiple targets, the better.
---
Keeping salv up on your heavy damage dealers tends to do a lot as well. Means you're spending much less mana on judgments which means more time spent regenning mana. I go so far as waiting for myself to lose aggro on a mob before judging as it's not a huge deal if a melee character takes a single melee swing or walks two steps towards a caster.
---
The one thing that I've found infuriating is fighting Thermoplug. The big problem is that he has some type of aggro dump on his knock back. Since I don't have a taunt it basically means that I don't even act as a tank for that fight. The whole time he just runs around until eventually slapping the casters.
---
warlock is good. the only real issue i had with my warlock. Is that you never get summoned. You always have to run to the instance and then you summon.
---
Blizzard creating new classic content "expansions" not increasing level cap but just adding new content? One can dream.
---
I see a lot of comments saying getting level 60 with an epic mount and farming MC. Lol you guys must have not played classic before. Idk how much time you guys have, but unless you plan on playing VERY hardcore for a minimum of 6 hours a day, don't expect being 60 with an epic mount and ready to farm MC. It's just not going to happen. And judging by how many people are playing this game non casually, you won't find a ton of played ready to raid for at least 2 months. This game is extremely slow and most people are here for a slow pace. GL :)
---
There was never a point when the debuff limit was 12.  Aside from that you have far more than 12 listed.
---
And what of the debuffs listed were "utterly useless" lol?
---
Corruption isn't a very large dps gain for a raid at all.
---
Well if you focus on leveling 7days in game time probably. If you play casually around 12
---
mog?
---
I'm just so good I never wipe man /s Hahah ya it's probably a good chunk.
---
&gt;will slowly die eventually
---
So does retail. So does every game. It is okay for games to die over time. Nothing lasts forever.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KenuH94YKaE
---
Eh it's not cheaper, costs almost twice as much as the normal 45 food. Not that you should be buying vendor food anyway, it's always better to tip mages for lvl 55 food.
---
Whatever your idea of fun is.
---
I'm reading it right now and enjoying it quite a bit.
---
What do you mean by more competitive? Do you understand exactly how the system worked? A person *can't* spend more time going for it than people spent back then. It simply *can't* be more competitive than it was at the time. We're talking about kids doing lines of adderall and playing Warsong games for 72 hours straight, twice in the same week, sleeping one time. Please understand, I'm not *against* those "cheating" tactics, I *support* them. There are very good reasons why things like honor caps and organized queues were put into place. If people start going for it on stream, I think it is going to be a serious lesson for everybody, including Blizzard. Gurgthock, of all people, should know better.
---
I strongly suspect that most people who are the loudest "no changes" folks did not play the game at the highest level at the time. I want a very authentic experience, but there were things that were flat-out stupid about the game.
---
I don't think you know what "elephant in the room" means ... a post on this topic happens every 12.642 minutes. Everyone is discussing this "issue."
---
Hi, /u/Statharas
---
Professions are hard to say being its a fresh server. Cant go wrong with Herb and skinning though or mining. If you want craftables then look into Leather working or Tailoring depending on your class. Dont go for enchanting as its costly and takes alot of time with a low level.
---
Respec is pretty expensive. I think Rogue will be best for both PVE and PVP but Im not 100% on that.
---
Not important at all. There will be PLENTY of guilds that do old content even if new content is out. There are gear pieces in Molten Core that are still sought after well into AQ40. There will also be guilds filled with people who do not rush to 60, that will start content whenever they get there. It is not uncommon to see MC / BWL progression guilds when others are well into AQ40.
---
You will not fall behind. Do not rush to 60 if it's not what you find fun. Endgame of Vanilla is arguably only a percentage of the game. If you enjoy the leveling journey, even if you want to do end game, then take the journey slow and do the endgame when you get there. It's NEVER going away, after all :)
---
I tried what you just mentioned in your post 3 separate times last night while leveling in retail and my group invite was rejected and my whispers were ignored.
---
When playing on a pserver I get ignored very very rarely. Even if we group up, knock out the cave, then leave without talking we still grouped and did something together
---
I‚Äôm glad you found someone to level with in retail but it is an unfortunate exception
---
Having to cross the dam and looking down into the wetlands, epic,
---
Typical reddit PSAs lol
---
Obviously you‚Äôre worried it will be doing well after 3-4 months - you‚Äôre on r/classicwow furiously defending retail.
---
Considering on our server, shamans were a rare breed. Our guild could only manage to bring 4-5 per raid.
---
They all went in priority to the melee groups for Windfury. I could count on one hand the amount time ive had a shaman in the healer group for mana tide.
---
It is actually going to be a really long 90 days. My big fear is that by the time 90 days actually rolls around I'll be over it and all my excitement gone.
---
The solution to this isnt an easy one for a theme park MMO. I think Blizz should embrace more sandbox aspects, it would be better for the health of the game in the long term.
---
I think one route they could have taken is something similar to what PoE does with each of it's new expansions. New content is added but older content still stays relevant. Blizz could have introduced new stats that are specific to a expansion allowing for different ways of playing your character, introducing new spells and abilities that can only be obtained through doing that content, or adding some sort of Mastery system like GW2.
---
There will still be some sort of power creep, but it would be over the course of many expansions.
---
Pot calling the kettle black. I have seen a lot of the private server communities throw vitriol towards retail players for years. You just did it just then too. It has been going both ways, but in my experience, the majority of retail players have been more than supportive of the idea of official classic servers for years.
---
Quite sure that if you removed the "being carried" from the raid, the raid wouldn't kill any bosses, so the term doesn't really apply.  
---
They were needed, even if they were doing "sub optimal" output.
---
Or they can just read the spell/stone
---
You probably just shouldn't have said:
---
&gt; It sucks because no one knew it back in Vanilla
---
so true man. Most people will have the same approach as you. So you don't need to worry about hitting 60 fast.
---
There are more relevant out of kit items in vanilla than world class pvpers have on their bars, lol
---
They all use vanilla bars cuz they have no use for any binds. Makes me laugh every time i see "pvpers" from the game. Like Cdew, who would be a dog on my server. Less than a dog
---
You'll find out soon, don't think that esfand is the limit of what vanilla is.
---
I have 5 different weapons for effects alone on my paladin. For things like CC procs, self speed buff proc, and instant cast proc
---
Not to mention my offhands
---
THere is a bar of binds in that alone. Have a bar  and a half for eingeering items. Another bar for random trinkets. Another bar for resist/mount sets. lol. A couple bars of consumes
---
That's why they made arena and locked off all the items. TO be a god in vanilla was WAYYY harder than any other expansion. Required way more knowledge and skill. And just general time in game, it's not a lobby game you have to build a bank. 
---
There is no usable flow chart when he could have 1 of 50 things ready to spam on u.
---
Correct. On August 12th you'll be able to select a realm and create 3 characters (per account, not per realm). You still won't be able to enter the game world.
---
Everyone, let's worry about the end of a game that hasn't come out yet!
---
All priests get racial spells. Dwarves get desperate prayer (instant self heal) and fear ward (buff that negates the first fear). Humans get desperate prayer and feedback (buff that mana burns people who cast spells on you). Night Elves get Elune's Grace (temporarily increases dodge and reduces ranged damage taken) and Starshards (channeled arcane damage spell).
---
Dwarves have the best racial spells. Fear Ward is incredibely strong in a few PVE encounters and good in PVP. Desperate Prayer is simply a good spell all around. All the other racial spells kinda suck. So humans have one good one (desperate prayer) and night elves only have bad spells.
---
Dwarves are the best race for priests, but a small case can be made for humans who do get 5% extra spirit, which is relevant (although not as good as fear ward).
---
Its amazing the fun you can make when you dont have a half a dozen daily, time gated things to so every day.
---
The only way you may be behind is on all the fresh market stuff. For example as a dual gatherer until i get to 60 i can make a pretty penny selling off unused mats right away.
---
Engineering also has some stuff that sells pretty well (such as quest turn ins and pvp items)  this will do well at all times but especially on a fresh server
---
i dont think you will be disadvantaged in terms of raiding, as most people join guilds with people they run into frequently. So you can easily raid with all the players who also took 1 month to level
---
&gt;because the system encourages toxic behavior
---
Explain how killing a player of the enemy faction on a PvP Server constitutes "toxic behavior".
---
&gt;I am going to be one of the sharks not one of the minnows lol.  
---
&gt;I have "big dick energy"
---
If you want to convince the world that you indeed have "big dick energy", whatever that is supposed to mean, a good first step would be to stop whining about getting camped in a video game.
---
This is such a great show!
---
I worked last stress test.. this one I'm off!
---
&gt;Better for your game\*\* there need to be gold sinks, and if you want to be a tryhard, you may have to actually try somewhat hard.
---
It's a terrible argument. 50g means people will rarely respec. A respec cost of 20-25g means people respec all the time. The latter is a far better goldsink than the former.
---
Healers can miss raids just as frequently as DPS can. The only person that has to show up every time is the MT.
---
BC and Wrath are what started ruining the game. Increased level cap, flying, arenas etc. etc.
---
Depends on your guild. No raid finder :)
---
Where? I‚Äôm tryna cash out
---
Not sure if video game release or preparing to be drafted to go to war. Either way I love it.
---
whoever said druids cant be good at pvp?
---
this reminds me of the pic of some instahoe in a bikini with the caption "who said latinas cant go to the beach"
---
I think it's important for people to keep in mind that they'll have plenty of time to play within the 26 hour period that the test will be live, but the first few hours is meant for testing and it's not guaranteed you'll get to play.
---
Please don't get frustrated that you can't play immediately, it's all for the sake of having a smooth  launch when it's actually released.
---
In 1.12.1 epic mount was changed to cost 100 gold. Skill cost 1000 Afaik
---
Previously the class names were frozen when scrolling, this is now broken for me in HTLM view. Any way to sort this?
---
Has to do with the animation. Spells always land at the focal point of a hitbox, which is typically the head area of a mob. Mindflay, being a channeled spell with a literal beam connecting to the head gives the start to the 'face melt' phrase.
---
 [https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/125515-mind-flay-draenei-shadow-form-with-updated-mind-flay-graphic.jpg](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/125515-mind-flay-draenei-shadow-form-with-updated-mind-flay-graphic.jpg)
---
It thins out for a few reasons, mainly because all the hardcore Guilds get that core set of tanks that always get chosen. Second its a hard role, since there is a lot of knowledge of mechanics and teamwork needed. 
---
Then you have the toxicity factor. Dps pulls aggro and gets killed, its one sentence in chat by the healer pissed he now has to rez them. Tank goes down and the who entire group wants to put their opinion as to why it all failed. Granted that happens less once they are more structured and players have been grouped before, but it discourages newer players in learning the role since they get shooed away.
---
You have to divide all non-Shaman / non-Paladin answers by 2 because of factions, which puts Shaman and Paladin at the top.
---
Am I the only one that has noticed that every single cinematic from sorta WoD onwards, is just a bunch of heroic speeches? All the damn time. It drives me nuts.
---
The current state of the story makes me mad &gt;:(
---
Not log into bfa and argue with myself what I want to play in classic. I've lowered it down to fury/prot warrior and enhance shaman. I'll be on a PvP server. I think currently my plan is to level a shaman, then level a warrior when I can funnel resources from my main to it.
---
&gt; Can you imagine a teir 3 warrior moging into like dungeon set. Semitruck hiding as a Tonka.
---
Or they could use a deviate delight and look like a pirate.
---
Damn, I wonder if that's the real "Otherguy" in the screenshot..
---
DSP? Is that you?
---
ahh makes sense, i think they are doing some artificial changes too
---
&gt;I don't really think an addon like or similar to Raider.IO will impact things.
---
Agreed, and you know why?
---
Because there is no API to provide a reliable data source from the classic for such an addon anyway :-)
---
Something most people scared of "Classic raider.io" seem to forget, is the fact that raider.io depends on the API for tracking mythic+ progress. No such API == No data == no raider.io
---
Anyone who disagrees is invited to tell what the data source for such an addon would be :P
---
News flash: Everything dies eventually. That includes you, me, the earth and yes, also WoW.
---
There is no way to stop that, so let's just enjoy everything while it lasts. :)
---
I was under the impression that Blizzard likes money, and to keep it flowing they need to create new games for players to buy. Since they can't make a decent game right now, they are rehashing all of their old ones. Every major title is getting a face lift and rerelease. Classic is no different from that in my mind. 
---
Money is giving us classic. Not QQs
---
Honest question, any idea how they do it in old school runescape? I mean do they release new content, better gear, etc?
---
Floppy disc and a potato
---
Healer* no idea how I didn‚Äôt see that
---
Phase 3
---
You don't need a big mana or health pool when you have AQ40 levels of spell damage damage in the MC patch. And you still have plenty of armor to take on melee as long as you wear mail. 
---
As for R13, I don't know what to tell you. Just because it has strength and melee crit doesn't mean it's only for enhancement. That's not how it works in Vanilla. AQ40 gear also has strength and melee crit, but anyone with a brain would call that stuff Elemental gear.
---
Absolutely. Easiest to use. Easy to level. Perfect for Gold Farmers. Lots of "huntards" out there that absolutely don't know how to control their pet in various situations, multishot or dot at the worst times. Etc.  The PvP was quite a tough curve though, compared to PvE. To be fair though, there are "noobs" in every class.
---
What really matters, is that you avoid the generalizing butthats and just play what you want to play. Be the Example, show them you're not a dumb dumb. I played a Tauren Hunter and I unfortunately had to frequently prove myself not to be a huntard, but they got the point eventually. Albeit I may have been in a guild that wasn't as friendly as they should be. You're still going to have randos or guilds that do heavy optimization of the guild and groups, but just avoid those if they say shit like "only one hunter per raid" or "only hunters for raid X" or "we only need hunters for these fights, otherwise switch classes or accounts". You don't want to be there, man. Don't turn the game into a job and don't let actual jerks wear you down. In a day and age where any game that comes out, people have some kind of optimization to spew out of their mouths and refuse anything else... WoW is quite old and there will probably be plenty of it considering how much knowledge about the game already exists and is available.
---
Off tank? In raids? Lol you‚Äôre joking, right?
---
Shaman can‚Äôt even get close to the mitigation of a Druid or warrior. Let alone threat generation.
---
I'm not raging, you singled out a response who disagreed with your opinion with some low effort trolling and I called you on it. 
---
Talk about dishing it out but can't take it.
---
Also you were 9 and had no clue what it takes for a game to be good. So there‚Äôs that skewed opinion you have.
---
No mouse. Keyboard turner.
---
Honestly I think they should do bonus content like the stuff that was speculated about during vanilla. And then from there add some flavor stuff like toggles for new animations/models/textures.
---
Uh.  What drives creativity in specs is encounter design.
---
One thing's for sure, after 18 months in classic and however many months in burning Crusade on the ground, many of us will feel differently about the flying mounts.
---
But I need to know that Asmongold completed the world first no wipe bowel movement... On a beta.
---
Yeah sorry I suck at that
---
Yep and a good hunter will fuck up all those asmongold wanabes lol
---
&gt;APES had many players in pvp specs for raid early on on this server.
---
I wasnt in the raid myself, but considering how our raiders keep flasking even in ZG to make it go faster, I sincerely doubt they did the first MC in PvP spec.
---
Holy clicker Batman!
---
Yeah but I started on a pserver because of the boredom and actually found myself having way more fun than live
---
30/0/21 is a godlike shaman pvp spec, especially with some spell damage gear, but it definitely leaves a lot on the table for pve. People will notice when they ask for mana tide and you don‚Äôt have it. 10% healing lost straight up, healing way gone, totem range, lower mana pool, no ancestral armor buff, worse mana spring  ... 
---
Certainly a casual guild will take you to drop windfury, I did that in Vanilla, but it‚Äôs not close to optimal. Hell on MC progression if you weren‚Äôt wearing cloth for the int you probably weren‚Äôt trying hard enough as a shaman healer
---
Yeah was thinking the same thing. Maybe 60 with epic mount, but farming MC or having BIS don't think that's possible.
---
Edit: I mean all of then combines is hard to achieve.
---
either way, why would 1 need to start getting their twink up in the first month?
---
It's a meme spec even in 5-mans.
---
&gt;I agree. Although Arms is probably pretty similar DPS to Fury at low gear levels, I would still hate being MS specced in raid.
---
If Mortal Strike shows up on the boss debuff list you can be sure we will clear the rest of the raid 39 man.
---
55 water is DM
---
As a hunter vet - heeds this comment, OP. Shadow Priests will melt your face, drain their mana and run! Also I tend to just 180 if I see a lock....
---
Or let me put it this way. *Every* PvE spec is suboptimal in PvP (and vice-versa). You're either playing a hybrid spec in a not-super-hardcore guild, or you raidlog, or you PvP in PvE spec, or you farm those 100g. Hunters and warlocks may have an easier time but every class faces the issue.
---
It literally doesn't work like this on beta is what u dont understand perplexity tested it thoroughly. U realistically cant deadzone on beta. Which isn't correct. Idk if I'm not being clear. I'm arguing deadzone is a thing in vanilla.
---
It is not a thing on beta because leeway hits u. Then u take 1 step out of leeway and the warrior has option to charge u. I tested it last stress test. This is with a lv 5 mage frostbolt.
---
I apologize for sounding condesending, english isn't my first language. Didn't mean it to come of like that :)   
---
I know BFA is a thing and I agree that it isn't a good game. Yes I have faith, because the classic team has actually deserved my faith. Remember how we didn't like their content release schedule? Or how we didn't like the loot trading system? Or how they went out of their way to re-create the old spell batching system for the new client even though it wasn't a big deal for many of the community?  
---
I agree that Blizzard hasn't been the same since Activision. But there's definetely reasons to be optimistic. Of course I'm also cautious since I want this to be a success aswell. See you on 27th of August!
---
&gt; I'd say leveling is 30% of the game, then end game is 70
---
I think you lowballed this.  Leveling is like 40-50% of the game in vanilla.  There's just so much content and it all feels meaningful because leveling to 60 is hard.
---
no procs in animal form
---
Pls let them do tbc then we can go back to fucking up the storyline lmao 
---
I'm half kidding but I would love a TBC rehash, I like many of the changes made in tbc (not all).

I do want them to get to what they are gonna do once azeroth actually becomes a Titan rather than a world soul. 
---
I'm curious what route they will go since in the lore azeroth is hinted to be the most powerful world soul yet . Does that mean all evil will just be vanquished? Will the old gods or even sargeras/the burning legion have had a lasting effect on azeroth? A lot still to answer in the world of Warcraft but chances are they continue to screw it up somehow.
---
There's a new Destiny 2 raid and season in a week. That should last me until WoW Classic launch.
---
&gt;retail has had a steady pace of expacs.
---
And has steadily bled subscriber numbers ever since WotLK, up to the point where Blizzard stopped telling anyone how many people are subscribed.
---
And in the sense of an MMORPG, Retail is already dead. It's an RPG-Simulator these days, optimized for the inevitable consumption as a mobile game.
---
for me my answer is no. I personally do not want a beta invite. I know myself, I get burnt out really fast.  
---
I started playing a vanilla private server and got to 30 right away and stopped because of two things. 1) I can feel myself getting burnt out and I didn't want this feeling for when classic hits because I want to get to 60 and raid right away. 2) server population sky rocketed 4x so zone ganking is a nightmare.  
---
With that being said, i jumped to an old private server wotlk, and have been playing the witcher till the time comes of the official release. I thought about subbing back to BFA but I definitely don't want to pay for something and be miserable lol. I have been on and off re-reading class guides and leveling guides to figure out strategy as well as videos to pass time
---
I agree but only to the extent of making the support aspect of those classes better and not the dps aspect. They should tune them so that whatever damage is lost by being a hybrid is gained when averaged out among the other 4 members of the raid group.
---
Forget the dude. He can't see that the patch previous you did far better on the rankings or has any clue how it goes for people like us.
---
&gt; Single spec only made you have an identity
---
So if a spec is your identity, what happens when I want to raid as a protection paladin? It's entirely garbage for raiding, and since it's my character's identity I can't just respec to something else.
---
Whats it matter to them what I see? If they have that much of a problem with it then they can go fuck themselves as far as I care. Who cares what I see. It doesn't give me any sort of competetive edge.
---
Does anyone know if there will be faction transfers? Would seem weird if blizzard didn't want the extra money.
---
Yeah it can definitely be cheaper, no arguement there but how much do you gain using an epic mount for 2-3 months? Especially if you take herbalism/mining. At worst you break even but gain massive QoL.
---
It just depends on your guild and communication. I don't see why you should ever sacrifice IRL needs to show up at a raid. RL comes first.
---
That's an RPG though, every class has something that they are best at.
---
 "Sorry we don't need a balance druid right now, but we would love to have you as part of our raid because of the versatility that you bring as a healer" I believe is preferable to "Sorry you are a Rogue, you parse exactly the same as a Hunter but you don't provide any buffs and are useless for some fights that punish melee dps. Pay a couple thousand dollars for someone to run you through BT and give you Warglaives and then we might let you raid" or "Sorry you are a Warrior, you are just a worse version of a Paladin for Dps with worse buffs and you don't have enough EHP to Tank. Make a DK if you want to raid."
---
If you design a game around the idea that every class should be able to fill every role in the game you end up with classes where the only difference between them is the animation, and the small differences start to make classes completely unviable.
---
LOL HK"s, ignorance shown
---
HK's? You think HK's get you honor or win you WSG?"
---
lol. Hk's get split. So if I have 40 dudes sharing an HK with me I'm not gonna get any honor.
---
And rankers can kill 2 v 5 easily, I just described to you what my bind set up was like. I have a lot of cc and fuck you items to keep some PvE plebs busy. I would never bring more peopel than needed to a fight as a pvper against people out in the world. 
---
You could get the other faction to just lay down and give you kills. That's about it. And that would not be efficient next to farming BG's because they built in all sorts of DR to make it so it wasnt.
---
Edit - people in vanilla sucked, the game didn't suck. You were 9 and obviously didn't understand. Now you're a grown man. Open your eyes pleb, lol
---
Were there actually people who played for the whole duration of these kind of games?
---
It will though, it may last another 15, 20, 30 years but eventually it will die. Eventually is the keyword I would say. I don‚Äôt think there is a death to vanilla in the near future but eventually all good things come to a close.
---
MC / Onyxia on farm.
---
FD &amp; drink my friend!
---
Exactly.
---
The 50g respec dont affect the hardcore portion of the playerbase that much. Never has. What it really hurts is the majority of players who are more casual and just want to enjoy the game. These players are the backbone of the community and having these people either quit as they cant respec outside of raids, or just raidlog wont make for a healthy game long term.
---
Polls show warriors, mages and (h side) shamans being the most played classes.
---
I think that's a large part of it. I have a friend who is very competent at the game but hesitates to tank because of the leadership aspect in dungeons. He knows the dungeons just fine and anything he doesn't know he's good at reacting to. This is a guy who completed every mage tower challenge in Legion. He's not lacking in confidence, he just doesn't want to be the one leading the way because he doesn't want to mess anything up (and he almost never does anyway).
---
If I'm playing with him over discord I can get him to do it no problem because I'll give him reminders about which way to go or things to watch out for, but I can always tell that he doesn't really need the reminders, but they help him feel less responsible I think.
---
They could be replaced tho
---
Everquest actually does this right now, they're running I believe 7 separate progression servers, and while the ones that are close to live are nearly dead, it's because they used a system of voting to unlock new expansions on the old servers, and after a few no votes a lot of people just gave up and then there wasn't even enough people left to clear the raids in order to trigger an unlock vote. The new ones that use a system of auto unlock new expansion after 12 weeks, however, are still very healthy even a dozen or more expansions in. It's all in how you do it, there has to be a careful balance
---
Grinding Shadow Labs endlessly suuuuucked.  The same shit over and over and over. I hated that world PvP largely died with BC.  
---
WotLK was amazing, and I loved Ulduar.
---
This is the most iconic pvp montage ever.
---
Rolling 2H enhance just for this.
---
"He never passes through them"  
---
Because they back up, which they arent supposed to do... You have the critical thinking of a goldfish.
---
OP was 9 and his opinion can be thrown out from bias.
---
Im not speaking about preraid bis here. Of course If you wanna play off spec you are expected to have the absolute preraid bis to make up for it.
---
But in situations where some classes are in high demand like shamans. On zeth kur there was a shortage of shammy. We could barely bring in 4 per raid guess what, they went all into the mdps groups for WF. Their mana tide was only for themself.
---
I could count on one hand the times i had a sham in the healer group.
---
bullshit bro me and my mates were on teamspeak 18 hours a day everyday for months while ranking, nobody in our entire guild did that. 99%? nope, more like 20% total or something
---
seal of command is % weapon damage
---
The thing is: When you take the guy with you AS A TANK, it doesn't matter if he can do other stuff as well...he needs to tank :D
---
Fair point, but that's a temp effect and you know to be suspicious of it as it stands out. Vs a perm change. 
---
Point taken though.
---
What does that even mean in this context?
---
Sorry i took die literally. As in end
---
What? You can see the server name in the charts, which is one of the biggest private server active.
---
No, it isn't a waste of time.  If it makes it easier, plus reduces the time/cost of leveling cooking later it really isn't any wasted time. 
---
Leveling cooking as you level is far far faster/cheaper than leveling to 60 then going back to level cooking.
---
I regret nothing
---
You call it hypocrisy - I call it self-defense. I dealt with 5 years of the ‚Äúwall of no‚Äù so I have no qualms throwing shade now. I said the retail community started it, I didn‚Äôt say we won‚Äôt reciprocate. 
---
You‚Äôre deluding yourself if you think there aren‚Äôt thousands of retail players out there who see Classic as a threat and don‚Äôt want resources going to anything but what they like. They are sharpening their knives and the real panic will come if the Classic drop off isn‚Äôt as large as expected, or if 8.2 fails to bounce subs enough on retail. I think the Twitch numbers have these people spooked but right now they can dismiss it as beta hype. If/when they can‚Äôt move the goalposts any further and when they run out of excuses - that is when you will see the real meltdown.
---
That said - for those who are open to both, live and let live. I would advise that retail-first players are not likely to get a warm welcome over here.
---
&gt;I mean that‚Äôs the whole reason why there is a respec cost  Your spec means something
---
How does me wanting to play a particular spec but being forced to raid as a different due to debuff slot limits make the spec mean something?
---
It doesnt.
---
MICROSOFT WE NEED IT
---
LFG
---
So no response to the actual thing I posted then? About how frequent/easy respeccing breaks a core pillar of RPG design?
---
Kinda, my problem is that Imperator Rome is a bare bones skeleton of what it should be and I got bored of that too fast to hold me over.
---
Escape artist is really good for pvp and dagger specialization is good for pve if you decide to spec that way. Saves you some money leveling engineering too due the +15 racial, and they look good with tiny models and large weapons
---
yup.
---
How about some evidence *any evidence* that the numbers are off rather than people's faded recollection of what they should be before you demand iron clad evidence that they are correct?
---
"It isn't much, but it's mine"
---
actually you can respec but its just comes at a cost 
---
making your choices matter
---
Back in Warlords I used a brown half length cloak as my transmog on my hunter.  The idea of an agile ranger type character tripping on their cloak seemed really silly to me, but so did most raiding gear in general.
---
Rumors used to spread around my realm of an AV battle that lasted so long, a player had entered on one day, left on that same day, re-queued the next day, and bam, into the same AV match from the day before. 
---
A legend I refuse to not believe.
---
I was planning on playing Human this time around, but fuck it I'm remaking my NElf Priestess I don't give a rats ass about racial abilities.
---
Haven't been able to test it personally on beta because I don't have access. But I think it's more of a case of not strong enough slows which makes kiting more difficult.   
---
Someone could test it easily though to see how big range the deadzone would realistically be. 
---
I'm quite certain it's that 3.34 yard window, it's just very hard to keep that without a decent slow.
---
If you want to feel like a needle in a haystack go mage. If you want to shine and still do everything the mage does but better, go warlock.
---
Right? We‚Äôre possibly 2-3 years away from naxx depending on how far they pace out the phases and people are already worrying about what comes after.
---
He didn't say "good offtank" :) Shamans *can* be an offtank, and the boss will die as long as DPS chill and healers focus.
---
And I'll argue that 100g as the cap is more reasonable
---
Would only blame the tank on bad pulls or if mobs rush the healer because he didn't spread threat around properly before needing a heal. It's probably the worst thing a bad tank can do because the healer is screwed either way. He either lets the tank die because he'll pull aggro if he heals or he heals and dies to loose mobs.
---
The entire character of Varian was constructed after Vanilla in a novel. I think it was around WotLK. Not precisely a retcon since his story was never finished in vanilla (The Missing Diplomat quest chain), but his model was in the game once under the island in dustwallow marsh and he looked a lot more like a priest.
---
&gt;Not saying it is, but does anyone know if you couldn't run the same command in Vanilla?
---
I mean. There's always a chance there's a script for the 1.12 client that nobody realized existed for 10 years of private servers but..
---
It will be stickied on the frontpage for a week. Thank you kind citizen for your concern.
---
OH yeah, I know. Thats why I'm stating how this will be a failure. Classic is riding high right now on some early game systems and fundemental system differences from retail, but once it brings in the big crowds of people from retail or even outside of wow into Classic....
---
I just hope the new players don't create a feral druid and ret pally, they're going to be really upset when they find out no one wants to invite them.
---
But the spec is not ideal for PvP, it's just not bad.
---
Arenas are the best thing about WoW.
---
Because they're doing what they should be doing: making a faithful recreation of the classic experience, as faithful as practically possible.
---
And they are doing a good job of it.
---
Completely different groups of people working on retail and classic, and most of the people on this sub don't care about or don't play retail.  In fact 90% of the memes and content are about how much people don't like retail.
---
I guess I'd ask what you like about the playstyle. It's never going to be like a TBC+ Shaman. You'll still be expected to totem twist, so even if you do find a guild that will accept you, your role is still going to share similarities with a Resto-specced Shaman. It's just what the class was best at in the time period of classic.
---
The only thing not possible is farming MC as that means you have cleared it easily already.
---
It was a week before the big nerf.
---
And we are taking a break.
---
It's probably the extra effort. Tanks should know the dungeon and the pulls while DPS just need to sheep moon and focus skull.
---
I‚Äôve been doing the same thing and having an absolute blast. I can‚Äôt wait for classic to go live

Okay then by your logic Blizz should remove all forms of choice because in the world of Min/Maxers and Elitists, there is always a right and wrong choice.
---
9.0 Patch Notes:
---
       We removed the 2nd and 3rd columns of talents because some players were choosing the wrong talents
---
        We also removed secondary stats, we didnt want players feeling like they were making the wrong choices when it came to gearing. Now all stats have a base itemization of Stamina and their mainstat.
---
Mindsets like this are the reasoning why progression is in such a sorry state. Just because for some "right and wrong" choice doesnt mean that it should be removed outright.
---
... the surveys are not faction specific.

https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b6l5jb/madseasons_poll_what_class_are_you_going_to_play/

Warrior: 3,991 votes for both Horde and Alliance means about 2,000 for each faction.
---
Shaman: 2,561 votes
---
Paladin: 2,035 votes
---
But does that require a weapon to cast
---
You're misinterpreting what I said. Vanilla won't die, but the servers will. People will eventually stop playing when no content is being released. They can merge all the dying servers, let the servers rot or they can reset the server as a season. And I was just proposing a compromise with the hall of fame type setup for an account.
---
I wager it won't be that long, but whether or not that's the case doesn't matter.
---
The game will come. I will enjoy it. What happens then is Blizzards problem, not ours :D
---
Not 100% sure because I haven't played the game but don't you have to que up at a NPC in a big city? 
---
Plus it will be cross realm so I don't think you could run to a farm spot in time to level up.
---
No idea, never played runescape all that much outside of middle school back then. My account got hacked and was unrecoverable as stated by jagex well over 14 years ago, never looked back.

---
So prove it?
---
The possibility is always here. Vanilla raids work ok if some people are carried. Some of your team members may be annoyed by the fact that they need to carry you, some may be fine with it.
---
An important question is, how do *you* feel knowing that.
---
i hope lvl 30 cap still a few weeks, im just lvl 28
---
Not having inspiration is kind of a big deal, even more so for Alliance.
---
But needed in some degree for utility and tranq shot.
---
One time I got the buff at the cleft of shadows in front of the trainer.
---
Do you have a source that pink unicorns dont live above the clouds?
---
No worries! I'm currently playing retail just to fill the void and get familiar with the game again. Fire off a message to BottledMoose#1561 (BattleNet ID) and we'll get you going!
---
It's only a bonus if he can do the other stuff as well. It's not rare that a healer leaves or a bad pull means the healer gets whacked and has to be ressed, which a druid or paladin tank can do. I'll take a warrior if I have to, but I always prefer paladins and druids. Especially paladins in scholo/strath.
---
There is no right way to do talents.
---
Does it? Outside of mages swapping from frost to fire as you move into AQ40, I'm struggling to think of any examples of raid encounters that drive specs. 
---
Meanwhile the need to balance your performance in a wide variety of content seems far more open-ended as far as spec design goes.

Dude, I would make the trip to that area as a lowbie every time I rolled my troll rogue
---
2004 account. got invited.

I am 100% sure that you don't have any experience or knowledge at software development.
---
Prove it wasn't possible.üòè
---
dwarf is the min/max option, but, if you don't like playing a dwarf, it doesn't matter that much. playing a race you enjoy is more important then min/maxing. i'm gonna be playing a Female Night Elf Priest.
---
Ahh the ol' you weren't old and didn't know any better...
---
Lmfao, I'm guessing you're 50yrs old now? Because no one with a fucking brain would suggest games can't be played seriously by children.
---
Hell all of the biggest names in Esports alone are of kids from the age of 16-19.
---
Hunter has a low skill floor, which makes it a "noob" class but a very high skill ceiling as well.
---
you wont get to raid very seriously as an enh shaman, end of story. you can try to find casual raid groups, but will you be able to clear unless a few highly geared mages/rogues/warriors carry your dps? eh
---
Little too late for pitchforks, just let me play Classic in peace. The modern WoW ship sailed in November 2008 for me and has been complete shit since then.
---
I don't think anything prior to Patchwerk is going to be the least bit competitive anyway because I think people will just be able to do it. I don't expect serious guilds to have a hard time with these killed bosses whose strats are known.
---
The problem with apples-to-apples comparisons with 2005/2006 is that they aren't going to be putting the pre-nerf versions of the end-bosses back on live servers, and there was something unkillable on *every* tier.
---
The actual difference is miniscule, and doesn't matter unless you are going to minmax everything. Every single race can be a successfull tank. Do yourself a favor, and play what you enjoy, not what a spreadsheet tells you to. The people who do the latter will burn out pretty damn quickly.
---
This is exactly the opposite reason why people want to avoid streamers. People want to avoid streamers because they  are worried about being yanked by a full raid following someone, not raid vs raid PvP that happened because they generated world content.
---
You‚Äôre going to invest a lot of time in to your character, so don‚Äôt base your entire character choice solely on racials which will come in to play like 1% of your played time. Play a character that you will enjoy playing. If you like humans better for mage? Roll a human.
---
I made another post about this survey and it is getting way more traction
---
Not trolling here - thanks for an actual positive post!
---
At the end of the day we will all have to accept whatever sloppy Joe they shove down our throats so no matter how much we complain we'll all have to endure in August :)
---
Alliance won and he has almost 1000 more HKs than the 2nd highest Alliance player. Additionally it seems like objectives are weighted extremely high. Some players with fewer than 1000 HKs but an objective credit got about the same honor as players with 2000 HKs and no objective credit.
---
Iirc it was single ball of shadow circling your character. In tbc i belive they changed it to same as lighting shield (still shadow) - 3 orbs floating, less if you used up charges.
---
Not 100% sure tho, memoria est fragilis.
---
Starting gear also makes a difference. I think UD have a bad starting weapon as a warrior. Someone made a video and the races that started with a 2-handed weapon were sometimes 2 shotting mobs.
---
Maybe you can have a friend create a Tauren or Orc then run to the UD area to hand you the weapon. :P
---
A lot of people think that retail is broken beyond repair.
---
When I say broken, I mean from a game design point of view.
---
I think we can all agree that blizzard developers are top class.
---
Are you guys leveling together?
---
Honestly Paladin, Priest or Druid would be my recommendations.

What do you mean exactly? They have said they'd be willing to do BC and Wrath but seems like you mean keep the cap at 60 and release a 1.13 patch? A bit confused how this would work and gear scaling would he a huge issue. This would seemingly split the base into 4 communities: BfA, Classic, classic with additions, and then the BC/Wrath continuation.
---
If you wanna pvp with players
---
Everyone is gonna ask you why the fuck you would roll human
---
So yes
---
Every time you're stuck in a cc or hamstring i'd think to myself as a paladin "this fucking idiot shoulda rolled gnome"
---
There are many ways to increase stealth/invis detection.
---
Grenades help aggro
---
Since  you deleted your comment. Yes I do understand how going harder/being  competitive works. And you absolutely can go harder/be more competitive  without spending more time on stuff. By being efficient, by having the  knowledge, guides and whatever to be better and more efficient than you  were almost 15 years ago.
---
The  point is that the guy doing WSG for 72 hours straight don't have to do  that anymore, because with the knowledge we have now, the brackets are  usually run by a group of people deciding the next rank 14. They're  doing this, so people don't have to do insanely stupid shit to get rank  14.
---
People grinded 72 hours WSG sessions, because they had to. You don't anymore.
---
In regards to PvE. My point still stands. People are doing runs taking 1/3 the time of a regular MC run back then. Warriors/Rogues and about any class are doing much higher DPS than back then. The once thought of Feral meme spec for DPS, actually can compete with Warriors and Rogues on Patchwerk bosses. All of these things are because people are trying harder and have the knowledge to do so.
---
Mm, I disagree with this, and your comment feels more like an opportunity to say "Blizzard doesn't care!" Streaming WoW Classic beta has been big for streamers like Asmongold.  
---
But honestly, I think you really just wanted an opportunity to push the "Blizzard doesn't care" meme.
---
&gt;What I fear this causes is players to forget that retail is in shambles.
---
For the most part, its a different player base.  Whereas they will be a lot of cross over for sure, classic isn't necessarily for the live server players, but to bring back people that haven't played since TBC or Wrath.
---
Whereas I have no stats or anything, I am going to say that the people coming back to classic don't care about live.  I know I don't.  Whereas the BFA cinematics are cool and Thrall returning seems interesting... at the same time, I didn't even know Thrall was gone.  So, whatever.
---
And like you said, there are two teams.  Classic team has nothing to do with the live server teams.  So it doesn't really have anything to do with us dudes waiting for classic to hit.
---
Lol its pserver log
---
We'd announce we were doing an MC attunement run on the realm forums with when we were doing it.  We'd head down there in a 5-man, and we'd whisper the people that signed up and tell them to head down to the instance portal when we were about 10-15 minutes to the Core Fragment. Our 5th would drop group and get ported outside of the instance to the Tomb up top.  He'd run down, take payment, and whisper us who to invite.
---
They enter the instance, we summon them, they get their fragment, and we boot them.
---
Rinse and repeat until everyone that signed up got their fragments, then split the pot 5 ways.
---
I think we were charging around 50g per attunement at the time, and we wouldn't go unless we had at least 10 people sign up.  Once we were in decent gear, it went super fast and we'd make 100g+ each for our time.  We'd get free DKP for helping guildies getting attuned, both for mains and alts towards the end.
---
My question is, can you use multiples like you used to be able to do, or can you still not stack them?  I can't remember if the whole guardian elixir vs. whatever the other one is was a thing when I started playing, but I do remember being able to use an elixir and a scroll at the same time.
---
&gt; only ranged wepon for pallies in decolace.
---
There are no ranged weapons for paladins. There is a trinket in Un'goro for a boomerang that can work once every 3 minutes or there is engineering for grenades and other trinkets.
---
In your 50s you can get a quest item that goes in your libram slot that can be used against particular mobs but it does not do any damage and therefore does not 'tag' a mob.
---
Also saves your world buffs and saves a boatload on consumes you won't have to repop
---
h0mans? I /spit on da body of ded h0mans.
---
I agree on tracking experience. I could see people getting shut of raids because they haven't done it before. But i could also see a lot of people in classic saying "i did it in '05" or "i did it on a private server" which would undermine the value of what was shown on some classic raiderio site. Then you'll have advanced guilds doing split runs selling drops to pugs that they are 100% carrying. So you have a guy that has all the boxes checked and the gear to back it up, who doesn't know his ass from his elbow, which further devalues that sites information. All of this happens on retail too. 
---
But unlike retail, in classic it mostly doesn't matter. 40 man raids are meant to hide under-performers, and pug leaders worth their salt (and those most likely to do background checks) will remember the person that wiped them because they can't hide behind cross realm grouping. In M+ you can't replace someone in the group, but if you're causing problems in a pug there will be a line of people behind you waiting on spots. IMO, attitude is a much more reliable indicator of someone's success in classic at the pug level. Which now that i mention that, if a raiderio type site had a comment section or a way to mark someone a troll or a ninja.....then i would see it be both used and dangerous.
---
The intellect really isnt relevant. It simply comes down to Escape Artist vs Perception. I would prefer escape artist.
---
Good combo for world PVP too.
---
&gt;I think we still need our pitchforks out about live.
---
No, we don't.  
---
As far as I am concerned, retail WoW is dead.  
---
It's an RPG-Simulator, prepared and ready to be converted into a mobile-game hybrid. I couldn't care less if they turned off retail tomorrow.
---
Vanilla was far more sandbox-esque than it is now though.
---
It is still a theme park game but you had far more freedom on the path you took to level and gear. Retail WoW is like an extreme version of Themepark, where there is little choice on the path you take for progression...everything is perfectly lined up for you to progress.
---
Whats wrong with race changes?
---
well there you go
---
Because that's pretty common knowledge.

Hopefully RNGesus is fond of you.
---
So do fury tanks avoid all defense gear? Without sitting to proc enrage, it seems you would have to - otherwise the talent becomes useless.
---
In protection - one handed spec, shield slam, and imp sunder all contribute to threat. Shield slam especially. 
---
I can see dual wield tanking to maximize threat making sense on farm content you want to clear quickly - but my recollection is that keeping tanks alive isn't trivial, even when prot, using defense gear, and shield block to push crushing off the list.
---
I remember getting in the 10-19 bracket but leveling to 20 before it popped. 
---
Not positive if you could just que from anywhere or if there was an NPC like in every little city to que with
---
Barbershop. I am indecisive about my character's appearance and like the change things up every so often.
---
&gt;Especially paladins in scholo/strath.
---
Can't argue with that :D
---
pwning backpedallers is so 2005
---
Kidding, I'm actually quite terrible in PvP myself, and I'm rolling a feral exactly because he's fun to PvP with :)
---
Retail WoW is significantly more complex than Vanilla ever was.  Vanilla is much more readily accessible as a mobile game.
---
why 3 curses? Only need elements and shadow
---
You could poke a mob with it though. No damage but it pulled them the same as a body pull would have.
---
From your description I understand why my brother likes Civ 6 and why I don't think I would! :) Thanks
---
I'm saying that the idea that Classic has to be what it was 1:1 will ruin classic completely.
---
People who argue that class balance shouldn't be address to retain what vanilla really was are taking more away from this game than they think they're contributing towards it.
---
&gt;That's an RPG though, every class has something that they are best at.
---
&gt;"Sorry we don't need a balance druid right now, but we would love to have you as part of our raid because of the versatility that you bring as a healer"
---
I mean... bruh, you just proved what I stated. in an RPG every class should have something they're best at, your example outright details the problem with classics balance approach!
---
If I choose to play a balance druid, I'm not fucking healing. I don't want to be invited to a guild to heal when I'm applying as a DPS, its very straight forward. If you want classic to not flop post 3 months classes and their specs will need to be balanced more.
---
What?  There is no better option than a Druid in BG's.  
---
In WSG they are 100% the best flag carriers being able to break roots and move fast with travel form, then go fire bear to hold the flag for survivability.
---
In AB they are basically the best node defense class.  Very few classes can cap on a Druid that is equally geared.  Immune to poly in feral forms, hard to kill, great mobility and ways to stop caps even at range (moonfire). 
---
Druid are easily one of if not the best PvP classes.
---
&gt; It's just that I don't, and could never find like-minded people in game.
---
&gt; That made the entirety of the game feel like I was being forced to sprint all the time, which was both not fun and frustrating.
---
Why though? This is the problem with the BFA/Retail circlejerk. Rather than people focusing on doing whatever they want to do with Classic they feel the need to shit on another game for no benefit to themselves or others.
---
I have groups of friends that I do things like 20+ keys, mythic raiding, etc with and then I have groups of friends that I just casually do shit with at whatever pace they want to go at.
---
I'm a pretty competitive person and I went through my phase of pushing World/US ranks years ago raiding 25-35 hours a week and now I raid far more casually (around US50) but when it comes to Classic I'm really not even thinking about raiding. I'm looking forward to taking my time, leveling, running dungeons, and progressing my character(s) over time. That's the great part about WoW (Classic or BFA) - you can do whatever the fuck you want and nobody can say one is more or less right than any other.
---
weapons are stat sticks while in animal form
---
True!
---
Just talking about later on...
---
You can get weapon skill higher than 300 ya know.
---
Odd groups go to left 
---
Even groups go to right
---
That means 1, 3, 5, 7 left
---
2, 4, 6, 8 right.
---
I agree, but I just don't know any other way to pick a good sever to play on.  I don't watch them and I don't like some of the culture surrounding them (kappa), but I don't know which server to join since everyone is going to be spread out.  
---
Back in the old days, I'd just pick one of the high pop servers with the biggest guilds.  Now, most of the people in those big guilds stream WoW.  It seems like the next logical step tbh.
---
450 dps top end  . also soul link wont die :P
---
That's a super convenient way to do things. If Classic kicks off you guys can do that all over again. :&gt;
---
The dynamic server cap didn't start until much later. (I can't recall off the top of my head when, but I want to say wotlk or cata?)  Early on it was static, which is why there were always constant queue times on the popular servers.
---
no, you can use seals regardless of if you have a weapon equipped. 
---
and i seem to remember soc proccing off punching things but its been 14 years since I was ret so my memory may be fuzzy there. i would assume at that point it would use your unarmed skill and unarmed damage stats.
---
&gt;proceeds to list a way of balancing things
---
Except not... He points out the distinction just before. Balance is them all being equal. Rock &gt; Scissors &gt; Paper &gt; Rock means certain classes are better against certain classes and weak against others. 
---
&gt; also what you're talking about is PVP. Core of the game is PVE. And balance there is almost non existing.  
---
Hybrid tax is a lie because warriors and hunters exist. 
---
While PvE is the core due to leveling, there were no PvE servers planned at launch. PVP is core to the game as well. Even PvE servers can flag and do BG's. 
---
The BG portal thing is entirely moot as there are Battlemasters.
---
Battlemasters were added in 1.6, you don't have to go to the portal to queue. Please stop complaining when you don't even know what you are complaining about.
---
This is very unless you are rich and willing to spend all your gold.
---
Are you not capable of separating the two? When something is done well, you praise it. Because if all you do is complain endlessly, your voice becomes white noise and dev studios have no idea wtf you even want. 
---
If WoW Classic looks good, you praise what you like to encourage the good stuff. I feel like this is social interaction 101 stuff here. 
---
This is hilarious.
---
&gt; I know they're different teams
---
This tells me you just wanted another platform to complain about retail WoW.
---
You:
---
&gt;Sorry bud if you think they'll put resources into bcc or wotlk you are crazy - at the earliest they would do that 4 or 5 years from now *if and that's a big if they did it.
---
Retail Players before Classic was announced: "Sorry bud if you think they'll put resources into Vanilla you are crazy at the earliest they would do that never"
---
You sound like a Retail player that stamped their feet and didn't want people to be able to experience Vanilla again.
---
&gt; I think it's important for people to keep in mind that they'll have plenty of time to play
---
depends.  stress test ends 5/30 7pm EST.  Between sleeping, working, and commuting that's little to no time available on day 2 for most east coast players with normal work schedules.  The first few hours, the hours meant for testing with no guarantee of being able to play, is the ONLY time I have available to play :)
---
I'm sure there were people calling for a rerelease of vanilla wow, but the motivating factor for nearly everything is and probably always will be money. Their cash cow was losing its player base so they made moves to retain them. The decision for Blizzard to remake wow was made because of the need for profit, satisfying gamer's desires was just a by product.
---
Totally me for the last months. Still hyped tho, maybe it'll last until release
---
Depends on what role you wanna play. I mean you can be pretty much any class you want between the 3 races.
---
I deleted the comment because I realized I misunderstood which part your comment was referring to. Your second paragraph is right, but that's how it worked at the time, by at least early 2006. I don't really disagree with anything you've said about pve.
---
Paladins are very easy. I recently got my wife into classic and "Seal + Auto Attack" is a great start. Then you an work in utility of healing, or judging etc. It can be as basic or complex as you would want.
---
I think a pet class would be pretty difficult although hunters are super easy levelers
---
The difference overall is so minimal that I don't really see it making a difference for average PvP. 
---
Now if you are going to seriously PvP then of course you would want to fully min/max in order to have every single advantage possible.
---
Personally I believe the best advantage of a gnome isn't the extra int, it's Escape Artist. Also you can factor in gnomes are smaller so it's easier to use the terrain to your advantage.
---
You're talking about diablo immortal right?
---
Rngesus and Oprawindfury are the two best enhancement shaman names
---
Curse of Recklessness is a ~3-4% damage increase for all the physical damage in your raid.
---
I saw that! Looking forward to the results!!!
---
This has been true for months now. It takes the better part of a day to get to level 10, at least on the weekend.
---
Im planning on introducing ice cream to places other than Tanaris!
---
I plan on rolling Dwarf Priest if I roll Ally.
---
Ahh you're right that would be good
---
*Looks at Twitch*
---
Yeah just a few players, whatever you say bro.
---
Right, but stats are good.
---
You can definitely queue in storm wind for example and then head out and hit 20 before it pops. 
---
BG queues are only in major cities so it depends on queue times and how fast you can head to a level appropriate zone or turn in a quest, etc.
---
get good
---
appeal to authority is not an argument
---
It's pretty common to see posts praising specific devs if they do things players like. People tend to hate a company as a whole, but they can see individual employees as allies, saviors or heroes if they seem to be doing what the players want.
---
This thing happens in other games too such as Warframe and many others.
---
When did you start playing?
---
Hahaha at least I have something of substance to say. Nothin you have responded with has any information based on why rogues and warriors are so terrible to level. That's why your comments have 0 pts. That's also why your afraid to say anything, because no matter what you say it will be wrong, and other people are going to start telling you that your playing rogue and or warrior wrong as well. Sadly, for you over the last 15 years people have figured out how to play warrior and rogue, and when you complain about how hard it is, they are going to tell you otherwise. I am sorry you haven't figured it out yet.
---
Most people get intimidated by playing warrior before they reach level 30 and end up quitting. Although they get a lot better after this level, there are things you can do  before then to make things easier. It's not that they are horrible to level, they just take a little more time investment than other classes because they are more gear dependent. There are guides that help you find the right weapons to get at certain levels, as well as gear.
---
Google is your friend. Does not take a pro player to figure this stuff out.
---
yeah but if you just want more hits there is the thrashblade and ironfoe. i do seem to remember warrior tanks at some point favoring daggers though, but daggers have a weapon skill that would be used instead of the skinning skill.
---
Retail WoW has more complex combat mechanics, everything else (aka. 90% of the game) is significantly simpler than Classic. Professions, Quests, Leveling, Class Ressources, Gold, Skillsystem, Dungeon/Raid Invites, Social Game.
---
I can legitimately experience the entirety of Retail content without ever talking to anyone. The only difference: It says "LFR" instead of "Mythic". Everything else is the same. And even doing Mythic Raids and Mythic + can be done with a minimum of communication.
---
The missing social aspect is what makes Retail simpler. The irrelevant world content is what makes retail simpler. The irrelevant leveling is what makes retail simpler.
---
You focus only on the combat mechanics, and that's a big mistake.
---
Here's a link to the current setup I have rolling. Feel free to ask questions. https://imgur.com/a/Rvrd4qs
---
Clearing MC and clearing Naxx is like the difference between LFR and Mythic. The mechanics aren't the limiter, but the time required to get to Naxx full clear is just as much if not more than doing Mythics.
---
One day you will die irl
---
just my luck, the one day this week where i have other obligations than sitting at home...
---
This isn't a bug, it's a mechanic. We won't have BfA-like combat.
---
And hope that you are either the GM, or you have a good bribe for yours in order to get Hand of Rag.
---
Yeah its very possible that private servers got it wrong, but that post has a bunch of formulas that have been disproven years ago.  
---
Private servers use the TBC formula since it actually comes from Blizzard rather than something someone came up with without evidence and it fits with the screenshots we have of rogues missing with 8 hit.
---
This isn't fair. TBC was still way more like vanilla WoW than it is like current retail.  Retail is shit now, but it's taken a long time and a lot of small shitty changes for it to get there.
---
It's not "tryhard" to replace raiders who refuse to contribute their fair share when they have both the knowledge and resources to do so. Go ahead and do what you do, but speaking from my own experience as a casual raider, the loot council and officers know who isn't pulling their weight.
---
Well it wouldn't be hard to complete a quest in a high level zone next to an inn, set your hearth to that inn, fly to the NPC in the big city, que, hearth, and turn in and ding.
---
Just be sure you're close enough to ding from the quest but not so close you discover a new zone and ding from that on your way back to they city :-)
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxMGs0bZf0xZVMGp0t this seems like I will just go oom quickly but I understand why it's good for healing
---
Really? Didn't know that. I've always heard palas needed linkens boomerang to ranged pull stuff
---
Why do you spend such energy thinking about this kind of stuff?  Isn't it exhausting to be in this state of doom constantly?
---
I played horde but I remember what I did now 
---
I would save quest to turn in and then que up and go and turn them in for the extra xp to level up 
---
Can‚Äôt wait to make a Twink haha
---
I would suggest checking out what this guy is talking about: https://youtu.be/JQYjsaG6epI
---
I like his take on the idea that prot pallies should not be directly compared to warriors or itemized same way as warriors are. Going for sp dmg might be more valuable then trying to reach def cap goals.
---
If you dont have crazy ideas in your head of tanking raids, only dungeons, this might be the way to go. Ill def be checking it out once classic comes.
---
Yet modern WoW is significantly less engaging and significantly more boring than Classic. I'd rather run in a straight line across the Barrens for hours on end than do another fucking daily mission.
---
I don't really care about beta or even stress testing, I resubscribed because I haven't played in so long I need the practice!
---
I actually ran into this problem starting Friday. All weekend I wanted to play something but nothing really grabbed my attention. The games I've been playing a lot recently just felt dull.
---
I spent all of sunday just watching Soda and Asmond.
---
I rolled on a pserver after not getting an inv so might end up not playing by the time classic comes out. Not sure if not getting a beta acceas is that great for me
---
&gt;A gear reset that made all of your previous accomplishments o
---
If you never have gear progression then what are you working towards if you've got the best gear at the time of AQ?
---
&gt;A mass migration away from the world of Azeroth to the Outlands.
---
Not sure why this is a negative, new expac new scenery, new zone, new story, new places to explore.
---
&gt;More simplified dungeon designs that felt like a transition away from a traditional RPG setting that allowed for exploration towards more of a "hallway, boss room, hallway" action game.
---
Name a single dungeon in Vanilla that wasn't the exact same you just mentioned except gnomeregan. Every dungeon was hallway &gt; boss &gt; hallway &gt; boss.
---
&gt;An overall simplification of the game, ie. one central hub city with everything you could need including an alchemy lab.
---
You mean like Ironforge and Orgrimmar? Lmao
---
&gt;Mind-numbing daily quests.
---
You're playing an MMO, grinding is mind numbing regardless of the action.
---
Hm ok, sorry, didn't know that. Will be fun if Classic statistics turns out to indeed be so different from what private server players are used to.
---
&gt; Also nerfed a lot for classic most likely because of BFA client and some other changes.
---
WTF
---
I was aiming for 14 / 13 / 24
---
Completely fucks over a key RPG element of the game.
---
November 2008 is WotLK. TBC was my favourite expansion.
---
Same! but also those from the alliance side! Those eagle shoulderpads were really sweet.
---
The only people who complain about damage meters are the people who suck. 
---
No one is expecting a hunter to pull more dps than a fury warrior in T3. 
---
No one is excepting a mage who is a tier behind in gear to stay on par with a mage who is a tier ahead. 
---
What people expect is for you to have a basic understanding of your class so that all things being equal your pulling a rational amount of damage and not standing there with your screen minimized jerking off and watching Netflix. 
---
Guess which group the people complaining tend to belong to?  
---
Is it possible to have 25 competent players carry 15 morons?  Yes. It‚Äôs still annoying though.
---
If they got up there, so can the Horde. #nochanges
---
1. This isn't the Blizzard Forum
---
2. This isn't customer service either
---
3. Rule 3.3. "No witch hunts or brigading.
---
Lol what are you even doing in this subreddit? Like whats your point?
---
A bit before AQ came out.
---
loved thotbot , now if you say thotbot in female twitch streamers chat they will time you out
---
I got it because I was a clueless Prot warrior and some friends decided I needed to learn to tank properly... so they took me to RFD (which I previously didn't even know existed).  X'caliboar dropped for the ret pally in the group, and Icemetal Barbute dropped and they gave it to me even though I couldn't quite wear plate yet even.  
---
I had no idea at that time that those didn't just drop all the time in there.   I was so clueless to how anything to do with loot even worked and I guess just assumed that certain bosses just gave certain things kinda like how in Diablo the Butcher on single player always dropped the Cleaver.
---
Hitting people from 10+ yards away is a mechanic? Ehh. I doubt it was intentional and my problem with it is it won't be consistent. 
---
If it's not consistent or repeatable with any degree of certainty it shouldn't be on the game.
---
Then go play retail. Why are you even here?
---
Making Elemental DPS mana-sustainable in fights longer than 1 min would make the spec pretty viable. I used to out-damage everyone in UBRS with shitty gear with less than 20 spell dam/heal. I was constantly going all out, trying my hardest to validate my character choice. I had optimal talents, I was working to get the best gear, I used the highest rank spells I could.
---
Then I went into ZG and AQ20 and was topping the meter... until I ran out of mana. I started downranking spells, it helped a little, but my DPS went down farther. Even getting more MP5 gear didn't help much. Never made it past that, I refused to go Resto on principle. I had no problem throwing some spot heals to help out, but I was an Elemental Shaman. Still am, actually. And I wasn't going to compromise. Then BC was announced and everyone stopped raiding anyway.
---
It was a based on the patch at the time which said 12, then was changed to 16. Also read the post It explains that questions you have, and corruption is a very large dps gain compared to the others. 100 dps, and chance for nightfall proc = not as bad as you think.
---
&gt;  if you say that hunters don't fall of
---
explain what you mean by this - all i'm saying that no good guild will use hunter as a nightfall bot. This is a fact not an opinion.
---
&gt;and Warlocks aren't top tier DPS
---
They aren't. Look up raid logs on legacyplayers.
---
 You're just wrong, and that upsets you but i'm not sure why... It's okay to be wrong, it means you have more to learn :)
---
And this is major problem. It's not meant to be just played, it's meant to be tested. To find out all major bugs that prevent smooth experience. Too many would just go there and play and if they face bug then just say how game is broken and never put effort making good bug report so it would get fixed.
---
&gt; I'm just saying the system shouldn't demand of me that I camp people.
---
But it doesn't. You could BG your way to the top. You could 'camp allies' in Silithus, Winterspring, and other areas where they might have a fair chance.
---
Instead, you are going to *choose* to go to level 30-50 zones. You're going to *choose* the easy fights.
---
That's not the game's fault.
---
That's where my experience comes from as well. I assume it would have worked in vanilla if it worked in tbc/wotlk
---
Like this? https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxMhsZf0xhZVMGp0to
---
I like the improved mana burn cause I feel like it's an important role as a priest to shut down other healers
---
Other way to contribute. When youre just a lazy raid logger sure. But i always been in LC guilds and never had trouble the gear I wanted. Of course i would help around a lot and be generous with my alchemy goods and would never miss an opportunity to use potions
---
Wpvp is an art...especially if there is an objective
---
There is a theme here
---
The irony of a fan of arenas not like objectiveless wpvp, hahahahaha. Don't you like mindless deathmatches? Hahah
---
Wpvp works in vanilla because there are objectives. Like taking resources, taking world bosses which give BiS loot, or wiping enemy faction raids. There are stakes here
---
You could wpvp in retail too, they just don't give you any reason. 
---
When you get wiped by 15 dudes as 40 man you'll know what I'm talking bout. Nothing better than slicing through plebs and ruining their buffs at the same time. And eventaully they'll mass up and try to do the same to you with 80+ guys to your 40 man. THen you wipe em AGAIN hahahaha. God i love vanilla
---
Cearly you're not a player. The game is so fucking good it got Blizzard to change their stance becasue people were having so much fun from a server made of bits of scrap. 
---
You know why the TBC crowd isn't loud? Cuz TBC sucks and it's just like retail what is the fucking point? 
---
Better PvE than vanilla that's it. But retail has better PvE than both so who cares?
---
You are a sad little pleb. You've been playing these games since you were 9 and are still bad...That's impressive. You clearly would have been better off starting on a more competitive game type. One where death match isn't the preferred competition type. 
---
You're the epitome of an MMO pleb. "hurr durr i love arena hurr durr fighting in the world is stupid" WUt? I agree with the last bit but doesn't make any sense in the context of being an arena fan.
---
HAHA bro what a MEME! Streamers are the worst AM I RIGHT GUYS?!?!?! ü§£üòÜü§£üòÜü§£üòÜ
---
Sorry if it was rude, but I have indeed seen basillion threads saying how illogical is *a certain interpretation* of "no changes".
---
I'll repeat and then elaborate.  I couldn't find any like minded people to play with.  Since MoP.  I haven't had a friend on retail in almost ten years, let alone groups of friends.
---
During that time I joined 8 guilds across 5 servers and couldn't even get a conversation going in guild chat.
---
I'm genuinely happy for you that you've had a good experience in retail.  But I've completely failed to at every turn since drama caused me to leave my guild and take a break mid-cata.
---
I'm not shitting on retail, I'm just pointing out that I haven't had a place in it for ten years now.
---
Possibly the worst DPS spec in the game with the worst potential Nightfall debuff uptime, does not bring anything unique to the raid group (Improved WF is a minor boost and you can get a resto shammy with it), also wastes debuff slot with Stormstrike assuming you are even allowed to use that.
---
Don't think there is anything much to add to that.
---
I like how that AXE commercial would have people up in arms in 2019 :D
---
Using blink to avoid damage is a bit like using the rhythm method to avoid pregnancy. Eventually it will catch up with you.
---
Important note: If you want to do this, make sure you're good enough to outperform most of your fellow raiders. Even casual players want to down bosses, and even casual officers will give raid spots and loot to the people who make that happen.
---
The issue with retail is that even though there is "15 years of content" you normally only really do current or previous xpac content. Normally not to many people are doing vanilla, TBC, WotLK etc in later contents unless you want to solo or do it for nostalgia reasons. The content that is most pertinent and will give you the most benefits is the current content. However, if the current content is bad, they made too many class changes, etc then people will not have the drive to do it.
---
What makes Classic so appealing is that the game is in a state where classes felt good and unique, mechanics were better, and now there is a purpose to do the content you may haven't done in years or never done at all. It helps that doing this content actually provides upgrades.
---
Actually warlock Sm/Ruin spec is both top tier for pve and pvp. Its one of the only class that can run a top build in both pve and pvp without respecing. It isnt the case for rogue (combat for pve and sub for pvp).
---
Well it was 32 in vanilla
---
I said "I like" him. Reminds me of myself just pre-TBC. My now sister-in-law loaned me the gold for my epic training and helped me run the Warlock quests as I finished leveling. Her and my brother were running MC clears with their guild, hoping to bring me up into the ranks eventually.
---
Don't do dailies then?  Not really necessary by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Auto stand too
---
And you sound like someone who doesn't understand the difference between them bringing back classic servers vs them bringing back an expansion... marketing will be great on it!!!!!
---
"Blizzard to relaunch the first expansion to their base game that they re-released in 2019 that originally released in 2004"
---
There isn't a market for it like there was for classic. The resources put into s tbc or wotlk is not there - zero incentive for them. UNLIKE vanilla where they will actually get people to resub.
---
But hey you are the detective that works for blizzard so I'll take your word ;)
---
Looking For EU Guild:
---
-PVP
---
-Horde
---
-GMT 
---
-Mage 
---
So since the good old days of vanilla I've become some sort of functioning adult, strange things started to happen...like responsibilities and commitments....my time has been robbed from me...and all I have to show for it is my briefcase, my haircut and my one-room apartment wedged between two bowling alleys....
---
So I'm looking for an English speaking guild, who understand the torture of questing for the 'work life balance'
---
I'd like to be involved in PVP (WG and Open World) and have a shot at raiding - although obviously understanding that the poor cursed grown ups out there who remember when peggle was cool....cannot be hardcore. 
---
Looking forward to right clicking mobs with you!
---
No worries! Haha, yes we will have to indeed. But hopefully it will be good enough for us :)
---
Is it possible for private servers to continue after Classic comes out? That'd be nice for those people.
---
So I'm confused. Are you asking a question or making a guide or what's going on here?
---
Having every single one of your posts in this thread buried definitely shows how wrong i am. Carry on, pro.
---
Needs a citrine to craft which are a pain to find for some reason.
---
Too bad, really. I still miss kiting Korrak into the Field of Strife...
---
I always thought they went the wrong way with the AV changes, even back in Vanilla. It was near impossible to get marks, so they made the games quicker. Instead, they should have left the BG alone (so what if it takes 48 hours to win?), and figured out something else to give you AV marks for. Turn in X number of blood/scraps/etc. maybe.
---
Again with the assumptions.
---
I'm just going to stop trying to argue with you because clearly you don't want to read what I'm typing.
---
&gt;Wtf is haste
---
I believe he mean't this from the perspective of Classic. Ie, "Wtf are flying mounts?". Not that he doesn't know what haste is
---
Yeah it does and i totally understand you. It does the job for raiding and allows you to enjoy pvp too.
---
I dont think anyone will hit the new cap if they implement it lol
---
Literally every Druid Specc.
---
Druids are awesome, and I am saying that as someone who never played a druid in Vanilla. They level extremely fast, are reliable tanks in all Dungeon content, and excellent emergency tanks even in a Raid situation.
---
One of my fondest memories is one of our druids, who was playing a Resto/Feral hybrid specc, and geared as a healer, emergency tanking Razogore Phase 2 when the Tanks died. We managed to salvage it to a bosskill, with that glorious bastard tanking the boss despite wearing half-cloth gear from Strat/Scholomance.
---
Or instead of giving the dps an arbitrary time to start dpsing you just say "Don't start dps until I say so."
---
Be whatever you fucking want. The game isn't that hard.
---
You playing classic pserver? I was looking for a wotlk p server but im not sure which one is the most populated and safe one
---
I‚Äôm with you. I listened to an interview he did with wowcrendor a while back and he just seemed so arrogant. I personally can‚Äôt stand him.
---
there's the compromise in sm ruin though as well, right? A little less overall dps than ds ruin in pve but way better for pvp.
---
I agree. I just don't think people in non-tryhard guilds should spend that much gold on a replaceable epic when almost-as-good DM mace is available. 
---
I guess Warden staff is good for a tryhard feral tank in a not-so-tryhard guild.
---
We'd sell Jailbreak runs too.  Got to know BRD pretty well.
---
Mailenhancement was another good one.
---
I spent 50 minutes fishing this weekend in the tb pond. Got 50 each of brilliant smallish, catfish and longjaws. That got me to 150 pretty easily.
---
Thinking out loud.
---
Mad boy gets mad when told his devs aren't really developing anything.
---
Okay so lets knock off all the specs you can't play in Classic.
---
- Ret pala
---
- Feral druid
---
- Balance druid
---
- Elemental shaman
---
- Enhance shaman
---
- prot pally
---
- survival Hunter
---
- arcane mage
---
- shadow priest
---
- disc priest
---
- affliction lock
---
- Demo lock
---
If you wanted to play any of these spec, consider your self at a loss because they were all trash until they were either buffed heavily at the end of vanilla or until TBC where they were actually viable.
---
&gt; They also have the most complex PVE rotation of all classes with autoshot weaving.
---
Untrue, 2h fury running improved slam has a much more complex rotation
---
It's far more based on the situation at hand with so many factors at play if you want to maximize your damage
---
The hunter rotation, while definitely a lot more complex than most other dps specs runs the same rotation regardless of the situation basically and it's not even that hard if you have a shot timer
---
Nope, blizzard wouldn't screwy over ppl that wanted to keep their characters in classic like that. Think again.
---
I love aspects of TBC but not flying mounts or arena-focused balance. Killed the PvP scene and started the march towards class homogenization, imo.
---
That‚Äôs why coms are important
---
&gt; Eh it's not cheaper, costs almost twice as much as the normal 45 food
---
The base cost is 70s and it does both food AND water
---
The base 45 food cost is 40s and the base 45 water cost is 40s
---
70s is cheaper than 80s
---
This is basic math bro
---
AND the AV food does both BETTER than the 45 food+water
---
My friends and I used to refer to that as *"speccing in to Improved Feign Death"*
---
taking about stonetalon
---
Yet we're playing on 1.12, so we just gotta wait roughly half a year to get battlemasters right?
---
Mods please ban thanks.
---
Look at OSRS when it launched everyone loved it, but eventually, people got bored because the content was becoming stale. 
---
Then they started adding new content to the game, that is in the same vein as the game, and now it's a thriving success. 
---
(By adding content, I don't mean power creep and pigeon holing people into content so it's all that is worth doing, add sideways progression, flesh out more questlines, and change up a 15 year old meta that some people have or will have played to death.)
---
Fair enough, that's perfectly fine with me.
---
I hope that it instead gets looked at by the Devs, compared to their correct reference client/server, and restricted if it wasn't possible to adjust in the original client (not just that it was not commonly known by players).
---
Probably won't raid much cause of other responsibilities. Mostly want to pvp and run 5 mans.
---
id say its about even for both the factions stonetalon is like wetlands for the ally
---
Define dead. I'd say your definition is "im bored, therefore dead game". Pservers didn't die, by simply launching fresh servers. Also to a fan, the number of players doesn't mean much. 100 million or 10000 is the same number in their eyes. And Classic, even without a single change or addition will never drop under 10000. In fact it will most likely be much higher number.
---
[http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/19398-tauren-swing-range-all/](http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/19398-tauren-swing-range-all/)  
---
This is a thread from 2008, about the same time people realised how huge tauren hitrange really was. Especially since you started fighting other taurens on a regular basis. As an example, a tauren warrior could hit a tauren druid thru the pillars in Nagrand. And therefor also macestun him, it was quite silly.
---
Add dampen magic to that list
---
I was torn between going with Skinning and LW or Herbalism and Alchemy but I think I'm going with the latter, now.
---
RBG is both more skillful and fun than arena but that is beside the point.
---
Both Arena and RBG contributed to isolating and separating the PvP community. While both are really fun to play, they never will belong in classic because they are bad for the game from an mmo perspective.
---
Yep, and all that happened in a comic book series most fans didn't read or maybe even know about.
---
The only historical evidence we have is that Blizzard DID screw over everyone that wanted to keep their Vanilla characters.
---
I hated it honestly.
---
-Flying mounts
---
-PvE gear useless in PvP
---
-Arenas dominating PvP
---
-wPvP non-existent
---
-Both factions sharing a city (fuck that)
---
Warlock is pretty bad until the later part of Vanilla, but it will catch up and leave Hunter behind.
---
What's your point? This is classic we are discussing, everyone destroying everything mode is over on live
---
Spybot, Winamp, Firefox. Good stuff.
---
I guess that would be doable. I'm assuming if que pops and you turn in the quest right before clicking accept you should be fine.
---
Horde players don't have the ability to jump or am I missing something? What's the problem here? Shit kids getting outplayed?
---
Oh lol hahahaha
---
Got to level 5 with 38 mins played. This was during night 1 of the stress test when the servers started working properly. You just have to avoid the main areas and get good at tagging new spawned mobs.
---
Retail already has set precedents for alternate WoW timelines via WoD and the bronze dragon flight. My dream would be that Classic gets set canonically in an alternate timeline and we get brand new expansions (NOT TBC or WotLK) so they can implement changes which helped the game while adding new content in the classic design style. 
---
For example, we could get the benefits of TBC‚Äôs class design without flying mounts or arena-centric PvP with a bunch of new content instead. That‚Äôd be a dream.
---
I was in the same boat between spriest and rogue. I almost exclusively PvP and have limited play time. Rogues get hard countered by a lot of things. In organized PvP and if you do premades people will want you defending. Causal BG do what you want though, have fun. 
---
I‚Äôm gonna go shadow priest and have fun wrecking one person at a time before I go back to wanding, and once I get some free weekend time I‚Äôll probably respec and go holy for awhile and try healing in bg‚Äôs behind a warrior guildy. 
---
I think rogue is the solid choice for PvE (if you want to dps, compared to shadow priest) and on par for world PvP.
---
Why would I be mad? I'm getting what I want after all these years of trying every trash expansion. No one cares what you label the work they do. Call it rehashing, call it developing, I couldn't care less.
---
It's even more epic if he was wearing cloth. :))
---
And yeah, having 2-3 HOTW-Resto druids pretty much means you always have 2-3 offtanks at any given time.
---
One day all of the universe will end. But as long as im a fan of this game, i'd be glad it's here waiting even if i get heavy burn-out. Just like i go back to D2. Numbers will never drop to a point where it's unplayable.
---
Comic books.\* He was only briefly featured in a few novels until about Cataclysm where he got a starring role in the overall narrative.
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre completely off base, and I agree that having no talent respec costs would lead to some of the issues you have stated. I do however see how dual spec is not the same as no respec fees. You could easily be the guilds hybrid feral tank and have a hybrid resto/feral dual spec for PvP. Or you could be pure resto healer for your guild in raids and be a hybrid feral/balance/resto build for PvP. The combinations are endless and having 2 specs won‚Äôt cause those combinations to be reduced. Same with mage, you could be a frost pve spec for raids and an AOE farm spec for your offspec. Or you could be a pve Frost spec and a PvP deep frost off spec. Or you could be pve Fire for raids and Arcane/POM pyro spec for your PvP offspec. They could even make the cost to respec your dual spec like 5-10 times higher than the cost of a normal respec and it might still be a good thing because it only removes one of the gold farming barriers to playing.
---
And thats how you become a copy pasta.
---
Youll have your chance to raid. Once BWL is out youll see mc and ony pugs poping out.
---
Was that WoW classic?
---
Can you not do that in retail?
---
I...I still use Firefox...
---
How long does that take relative to questing?
---
Yeah hopefully I can pick up my anethiam sometime during a pug lol
---
So..?
---
1.6 is before 1.12....
---
Don't play a hunter right now though. The autoshot is still bugged to shit.
---
Hi, /u/h34d5h071911
---
261-90 üòÇüòÇ man slayed out.
---
I‚Äôm also in your same boat. Let me have fun with Classic for at least two to three years before we start adding to the game.
---
This is the last time this will ever happen, let‚Äôs not rush through it!
---
Holy Paladin. Instant premade invites for life whereas Gnome mage #1435 will have to form his own group.
---
Dwarf priest and Warrior are both strong.  Priest gets Fear Ward, which is simply amazing and Desperate Prayer, which has its uses. Warriors get a lot of use out of stoneform, which dispels bleeds, poisons, diseases, and increases their armor by 10%.  The +10 Frost resist is also a nice little boost against frost mages; which will be your bane.   Dwarf paladins are just OKAY, in my opinion, as their class does most of what their racials give you, so they are a bit redundant.  Dwarf hunters are good if you use guns.  Dwarf rogue is actually pretty good, since stone form removes dots that might prevent you from restealthing, and the frost resist is also good against mages.
---
Humans are good at pretty much any class.  Warriors and paladins love the +5 sword and mace skill, but that's about all they get for PVP.   The extra rep can be nice if you are going for any gear from BG vendors.  Human priests are pretty good, too with the extra spirit.  Desperate Prayer is good on humans as well, and Feedback has its uses, especially with mana being a valuable resource.  Human mages and warlocks don't gain too much from their racials, but Human rogues can be good with the +weapon skills and the stealth detection.
---
So, it all depends what you want to do.  If you plan on doing group pvp with healers, then human warrior, rogue and paladin are best as you can sacrifice the defensive Stoneform for the +weapon skill.  Dwarf is better for if you plan play a priest, or if you plan to do mostly solo content, as you will need to be much more self sufficient.
---
Yo this is a great comment it hit me hard and i wasnt thinking about WoW when I read it. Thank you for this.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm always surprised how set in stone the idea that Druids are bad is. Amazing levelers, amazing at every roll in dungeons, amazing st 1v1 PvP and flag carrying, pretty much unkillable I‚Äôd they choose to run. And then there‚Äôs the perk of being fed all of your gear because guilds usually end up deleting Druid gear anyway (Since their 1 or 2 Druids are already decked). On servers I played on every guild needs Druids, but they‚Äôre still memes in forums and reddit
---
It's not gonna take 200 hours with twink gear.
---
Windfuhrer checking in
---
I'm saying if people want to play any of the classes listed above they're going to be restricted to what they can actually do in the end game because of how sub par they are compared to the top specs at the time.
---
Theres no reason to not balance the specs out during classic.
---
Thinking it assumes some sort of basis for that thought, which is impossible. But nice attempt at playing word salad, bruh.
---
Yeah, shadow, ele, enh, boomkin and prot pally just need to be able to cast their spells for the whole fight without being oom in order to be "viable" Adding debuff slots would also make kitty dps viable as well as helping enh, shadow, hunters, and rogues all do a lot better dps.
---
Dont forget mIRC
---
Agreed, I enjoyed the pvp towers and halaa and other small things that were added to entice pvp that were gone after BC.
---
It is very likely you will :) it has 50% chance to drop from the chest so some guilds start selling it
---
Scatter, trap, kite high skill cap lul
---
i read it and it doesnt really come out clear. the original was comparing wetlands to stm which is pretty fair both are predominantly occupupied  and close by horde/ally and both are lvls 20-30 contested zones. whether the zone is contested by the minority faction is entirely different from server to server.
---
Actualy, you get the mage 55 water at lvl 60, not 55. And in retail vanilla you made 2 per cast, untill suuuuper late in the patch progression (afik AQ patch or even later) where you made 10 per cast.
---
Druids are the class, and druids have things that they are best at. Balance druid is a spec, not a class.
---
How are dwarf / Nelf hunters in pvp
---
Oh snap, you're right...got my years mixed up.
---
That's fair.  WotLK was the last expansion that I played "for real".  But I didn't hate WotLK as much as I dislike current retail.
---
I made a shaman back in the day because of this video
---
but then its no longer classic....
---
The problem is, those differences aren't realized in game, they're realized outside of a given mode of gameplay. When you're in a bg, you're not gonna see a variety, you'll see the same streamlined pvp specs. When you're in a raid, you'll see the same hyper optimized pve specs. When you're out in the world, you'll see the same grind specs. The net effect is that diversity of experience is drastically reduced.
---
I totally understand trying to apply Diablo to WoW.  When I first started playing I was really confused and was wondering where you found magic find gear so you can farm stuff easier.
---
I got a rude awakening ... and proceeded to farm the crap out of vanity pets and mounts the next 4 expansions.
---
and ill assume the only class that cant be oversimplified into a meme is the one you play, then?
---
Roll another class.
---
I really hope people manage to make an addon better than what we currently have on private server and closer to retail with enemy cast bars.
---
TBC was great and that is the server I will play most if it launches
---
I think, for the average player, Vanilla hit the sweet spot in terms of sense of accomplishment from difficulty. I‚Äôm simply arguing for the best possible recreation of this, rather than what we will have on release, where same-level content will be a breeze.
---
Hardcore players will always find content ‚Äúeasy‚Äù by comparison which lead to Hard Modes/Mythic/Mythic+ in retail. I am not suggesting anything to accommodate these players.
---
I wouldn't call that a \*major\* plot hole. Garona wasn't a big character by the time WoW was out, I don't think most people cared. And there are other ways of fixing that plot-hole besides taking the Draenei and saying they are actually Eredar, while forgetting that the Eredar had a different origin prior to that development.
---
I believe Metzen just thought it would be cool to create "Good" demons and felt the Draenei were the easiest method to do so.
---
Wait, what? 12+ hour AV games is what I was looking forward to the most :( rip hype
---
I didn't do alot of dungeons until after level 50. BRD. I got there. Invited as a tank mind you. I thought Tank just meant warrior because we wore plate. Similar issues. Had a 2her. Didn't understand the whole tanking thing. Didn't have a shield. Group broke up. One of them told me to go read the guides on the forums. I started reading. Ciderhelm happened to play on my server at the time. After reading his guides I sent him a few whispers. Was friendly with him through most of classic. Ended up being a main tank for a decent casual guild. But yaaaaa that first time was pretty embarrassing looking back at it. I was so bad I didn't even know what "tank" meant.
---
I'm just telling you how it is. You will be a burden to your raid group. Do you want to be a burden?
---
The problem wasn't the timing of the movie, but rather that it sucked
---
I would say that Night Elves a bit stronger, since Shadowmeld has a lot of uses in PVP, and it can allow you to get the jump on a lot of unaware people.
---
I don't think so.
---
If it's common knowledge why would you feel the need to even clarify it to begin with?
---
The article states that Europe is generally cooler than the US to begin with and that countries in the EU that are hotter like Spain and Italy have seen big upticks in AC usage.
---
mIRC, ahhh, the good old days.
---
I've compiled a list of your greatest hits of raging like a fuckin baby for not getting a beta invite.  enjoy.
---
&gt; Anyone who subs to BfA for classic not a beta is a pathetic loser. Pathetic Loser
---
&gt; you people are pathetic losers GG. Blizz has youre asses trained to do what they want. You all are so sad you activated your wow sub just to play a 2 hour demo. LOfuckingL
---
&gt; Ya, give blizzard money for nothing. It's pretty sad how many players are handing over money to blizzard just to get ass fucked, dry.
---
&gt; You suck at wow
---
&gt; Are you a streamer? No? Then you won't be invited. It's that simple.
---
&gt; Do you think you're getting in? Think again everyone. Unless you're a streamer you aren't getting jack shit except blue balls waiting on the release. 
---
&gt; You do realize the IF they have a beta you WONT be invited unless you have XXX numbers of stream followers? This has nothing to do with testing, it's an advertisment. Why else would they invite a bunch of scrubs like the ClassiCast members who don't know jack shit about Classic?
---
I never said I disliked vanilla, I'm saying that there were some obvious negative things about Vanilla I'm glad were fixed but for some reason we're going back to without remembering why there were so bad for the game.
---
My biggest gripe is class balance, if over 50% of the specs in the game are unplayable in the end game how do you think classic will survive more than 3 months?
---
Google the class/spec you'd like to play followed by the word 'profession' or watch a classic profession youtube video.
---
It does not work in vanilla, TBC and wrath. I don't have other clients atm so I can't check. In vanilla it was 100% hardcoded and only client hacks could change it. After 1.12 the range was increased at some point (no clue if it was 2.0), but you still couldn't change it.
---
Just google and see all the pserver threads with people asking, the answer is always the same.
---
Edit: But yes, camera distance could be raised above the menu slider cap since forever. But there never was an option for nameplates to begin with, that's rather new. Additionally only ONE function can change this cvar in the beta client, the others throw an error, so it probably is an oversight. At least I hope so.
---
You are right.
---
Part of classic was some things being better than others, the quest for balance is how you get every class and spec feeling the same, just like retail
---
Classic is WoW as it was not as it is today
---
Are you blind?  Ofc dwarves are the superior choice for visuals.
---
Thanks :)
---
It was a joke mate, lighten up
---
Links arent allowed here but you can def find  populated wotlk server - look at r/wowservers
---
As for the classic one I play at - it has &gt;10k online so at least its fun that everywhere is full of ppl
---
[When you top score but still lose the BG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7d/DJ_Khaled_Suffering_from_Success.jpg/220px-DJ_Khaled_Suffering_from_Success.jpg)
---
The one thing that costs a lot would be the consumables, so Herbalism/Alchemy would be reasonable.
---
For guilds that require Engineering (for extra DPS), then you can do Engineering/Mining and have Herb/Alch on a fast leveling gathering alt like hunter/feral drood.
---
Engineering and a 2nd crafting profession if there is BoP gear that is BiS for a period of time.  For example a mage will want tailoring for robe of the archmage as pre raid bis.  Then later on for the bloodvine set.  Outside of those times ita not needed.
---
If you are power leveling, cooking just slows you down. You can buy food w/o buffs from vendors. First Aid is pretty easy to level while on boats/zepplins and you will definitely get enough cloth while leveling but you might be missing cooking ingredients.
---
WoW wasn‚Äôt my first mmo, so tanking was pretty easy to understand for me.
---
Warlock is not bad at any stage of Vanilla. Warlocks offer much more than just DPS. A Warlock could do zero DPS in a raid and still provide enough utility to make having one mandatory. The only problem is that their usefulness does not scale in numbers, so there is not a reason to bring 6.
---
If you‚Äôve sat in their earnings calls they openly discuss micro-transactions for retail. If they could also bring micro-transactions to Classic....which is what the normal stockholder would like.
---
However, that‚Äôd utterly ruin the game and hopefully they understand that.
---
Just got to find the recipe for savory deviate delight!
---
Any alliance guilds with 1-2 raid nights a week, maybe one on the weekends? 
---
Not looking for a top tier guild schedule-wise, but would like  to see almost all raid content at a reasonable pace on a working schedule.
---
How do you learn about a 15 year old game that you‚Äôve never played and can‚Äôt play until it‚Äôs re released without reading forums and making posts like this to engage with the vanilla vets like yourself? 
---
I never played patch 1.12 so I don‚Äôt have a great idea of how the classes will work together or how important the main specs actually are. You can get so much more detail and Info from asking real people about their real experiences rather than just watching endless YouTube and reading forums. That‚Äôs why I came here. 
---
It‚Äôs good to hear the shittier specs still fill a niche, because that‚Äôs not really what you read elsewhere.
---
Engineering BiS prof
---
This was in Vanilla. I remember doing this back in the day holding the flag. So shitty, haha.
---
Could you pm me the classic server you are playing on? That sounds like a healthy population
---
A geared enhance with lucky procs can one shot anything in PvE. There are a bunch of hilarious montages from over the years. If you're a PvP orientated player and may consider healing I'd push you in the Pally direction, but if you're only interested in DPS specced PvP Enhance shaman might be for you.
---
I've already lost some excitement, as I remember all the things that brought vanilla down that people have no interest in fixing
---
eh, it's only to level 10, only for 24 hours. i'm definitely gonna roll a hunter to fuck around with. if i was in the real beta and was gonna hold onto the character for a bit, i'd be inclined to take bugs that like that more into account, i'd probably avoid hunter.
---
But 24 hours of screwing around? I'll deal with it.
---
We‚Äôre 15 years later. I don‚Äôt think 90 days is gonna make a difference.
---
Becuase you're asking me about it?  It's common knowledge that most countries in the EU don't have high AC usage.  Two countries =/= the entire EU.
---
Going hardcore ...
---
Engineering will be required in any semi-serious guild, even for healers.
---
My guild killed Illidan before 3.0 and downed exactly zero bosses in Sunwell. Big nono indeed.
---
I'm pretty sure it was 19.99 but it could have been 18.99 I haven't been subbed for a while I didn't know they did away with the conversions.. my bad
---
This is something you eventually grow out of. It just takes time. People grow in "acceptance of usage" more as time goes by.
---
Oh I forgot about this secondary debuff from CoR. True
---
Of course you assume I will be raiding. If you keep looking at the game through only the perspective of raids then obviously only certain specs are viable.
---
People acting as if being in a spec that pulls a bit less DPS means you'll never get into a guild or are disrespecting your guild members if you do are being unrealistic.
---
Sure, if you're playing in a guild that is shooting for maximum effeciency that's true, but realistically up until Twin Emperor's in AQ40, the game is remarkably easy and does not require nearly as many people pushing their class' potential as some seem to think. Many players, good spec or not, are going to be pulling shit DPS regardless. Even in a middle-of-the-road level of seriousness guild you may find yourself beating out optimally specced players in your hybrid spec.
---
Just play what you want and be very clear to those who you play with what your expectations are. If your guild doesn't care if you're off-tanking while you're half arms spec, then who cares? I would argue that same guild would still be able to pull off clearing the majority of raids in the game even if they accepted hybrids. It just may take a bit more time or gear.
---
The class balance is shit though. I don't see people being happy if protection paladins are forever shit as tanks. People accept it because that's what it was at the time but they won't if new content is being added.
---
Yes yes yes 100 times yes! Anything that does ANYTHING to your boost your stats for any length of time is only going to help your journey to go as smoothly as you can make it!
---
Who the hell made the original that had all the spelling errors?
---
From what I recall, if you level there from 10-&gt;25, you're likely to find it (anecdotal, but I never had a char not get one, across 5 that went thru the barrens before bc)
---
There are only going to be a handful of realms. Layering during phase one is going to act as 'virtual realms' to handle massive overpopulation during the first few weeks. After the initial population bubble the realms will drop to a healthy population and layering will be removed.
---
I specced my druid balance because I thought that was the only talent tree, but still played in cat form. And stats didn't matter, if it was leather armor, I wore it.
---
Yeah, when you can start a new character and be content capped within 2 weeks on BFA, that 15 years of content isn't "real"
---
It takes you two weeks just to hit 60 in classic. There is a ton of investment to make after that, even for the most minute changes.
---
Yes, exactly this.  We can be both critical of BfA as well as not jumping down their throats every time someone notices a bug that was already acknowledged.
---
I think you should let her pick whatever she wants and then you play a support toon for her class while you level together.
---
I would say that it is. Do you believe global warming is man made? What makes you believe that? Could it possibly be that most leading scientist thinks so? Do you believe in big bang? Have you seen the evidence? Or is it because leading scientists believes in big bang?
---
But either way, lets argue:
---
Gnome: 0.5s delay remove root/slow 1 min CD 
---
Dwarf: immune to disease, poison and bleeds, +slight armor buff, 3min CD.
---
So what uses are there. As a gnome you can break nova/slows from a mage without having imp sprint spec, this allows flexibility and the use of cold blood which combined with base damage evis and low crit is amazing early, which is the time to be ranking. Against warriors it allows you to break hamstring and kite better. Against any engineer it allows you to break netomatic, and versus flagcarry druids you can remove nature's grasp.
---
Dwarf: Allows you to remove devouring plague which doesn't allow you to stealth, but does make UD shadowpriest a better matchup as it's mostly just a face on who can kill who faster type of fight.
---
Allows you to remove blind, which helps massively in rogue vs rogue matchup, but ultimately rogue vs rogue matchup is oneshottable so without LAP(not available pre 1.8), it's pointless.
---
Allows you to remove bleeds from warrior and get restealth. Quite good, similar to gnome in that sense.
---
So in total, gnome allows you to fight mages and druids better, dwarf allows you to fight undead priests and rogues better. Now if you are world pvping I can see the appeal to dwarf but it's still arguable, if you are doing premade pvp, then gnomish is the clear winner.
---
Engineering is also the best profession for PvP so if you aren't losing out on anything by maining Engineering. You can even sell ammo to hunters for profit.
---
Actually got back into Street Fighter V and having a blast
---
no not really i plan to go into demonolgy  for lvling and wpvp but then its sm/ruin @60 for pvp/pve. Master Demonolgist/ruin is the closest thing to a SL spec thats for pve and its only for twin emps in aq but im sure you can find a weird niche to help your raid with this spec. once im fully geared (T2) ill definitely fuck around with a lot of specs
---
Yes, it was probably the way they decided tom implement fights in the server so people with worse connections could still play instead of being out of range forever.
---
You can watch any vanilla/TBC video (from back then on original blizzard servers, not privates) and see that melee does indeed attack from a range further than 5 yards.
---
#nochanges
---
I'm gonna have to turn this around at you and ask if you watched this video. Preach himself says that he didn't think he would like classic but after rediscovering it, he loves it. That's him admitting he was ignorant.
---
It really depends.  As a hunter, if you are in a position where you are getting bled, poisoned, and need the extra armor, then you are in a bad spot no matter what race you are.  Stoneform might clear those debuffs, but it's possible you will die anyway if people are in your face like that.  If you are any good at kiting and keeping people at a distance, then shadowform is probably better.
---
Unfortunately people don't choose a class to play only a single spec. Especially if they're not keen to be a healer.
---
&gt;If you never have gear progression then what are you working towards if you've got the best gear at the time of AQ?
---
Gear progression worked fine in classic without a complete reset. I would much prefer a system like EQ where you typically kept gear longer and you would sometimes be using some gear from 2-3 expansions ago. Gear and upgrading felt a lot more meaningful, and doing well in a particular expansion put you ahead of the pack when new content was released because there weren't any artificial resets.
---
&gt;Name a single dungeon in Vanilla that wasn't the exact same you just mentioned except gnomeregan. Every dungeon was hallway &gt; boss &gt; hallway &gt; boss.
---
Huh? I'd name most of them. Maraudon, Black Rock Depths, Dire Maul... pretty much everything except for Scarlet Monastery, which I'm not a huge fan of.
---
&gt;You mean like Ironforge and Orgrimmar? Lmao
---
Well you named two cities instead of the one option you had in TBC: Shattrath. But you also strangely forgot about Thunder Bluff, Undercity, Stormwind, Darnassus, and Booty Bay. Also these cities didn't have absolutely everything like Shattrath did. Need a Druid trainer in Undercity? Not gonna find it. Need to train Axes? Gotta go to Orgrimmar. Also none of those cities had an alchemy lab. Before TBC you had to go to Scholomance or BWL for that. That's why I mentioned it.
---
hogwash
---
Haha, don't mistake this is me standing up for any design choices they made.
---
I'd like to see this be a restart for the WoW series.  Almost like an alternate timeline.  Maybe don't go into TBC but something else entirely.
---
Lol no
---
i actually used to let my subscription run out back in the day at 60 , and I just stayed logged in for a few days playing for free, I would randomly get kicked off and such and would have to resub, but I did min/max the system like that. so people WILL game the layers, if it possible.
---
Anyway it was just a silly goldcap joke :)
---
I.may have got that wrong. I meant like the gear you get from pvp...
---
Good points but not entirely true. The triple crit is extremely rare with windfury, and a very well geared shaman hits a normal white hit of ~400. So basically windfury combo with one crit could be around 1500 dmg, not quite enough to one shot. But when that triple crit hits its amazing.
---
&gt;I never said I disliked vanilla
---
HMM
---
&gt;I honestly didn't like classic all that much tbh.
---
Also, if you want to gripe about class balance, BC was equally notorious for issues with classes being excluded from raids because of their spec or even just being melee vs ranged.  "Sorry, we already have a melee DPS for Kara, we can't take any others."  BC was just as bad.
---
And private vanilla servers have been running for YEARS.  Why are you talking as if Vanilla WoW isn't being played right now?
---
Enchanting vellum. Being able to enchant from a trade/bank alt and sell on the AH would be nice.
---
Its definitely 18.99, I checked a few days ago
---
There isn't a single thing any of those specs do better than their counterparts.
---
Not a single thing.
---
Tell me more
---
I don't know if I would agree. It's a quite useful spell compared to something like ampilify, but again it's not a mandatory spell.
---
I don't know how it was for everyone here but on my PvP server a lot of people never seemed to take Alchemy on top of their Herbalism. I made quite a bit of gold doing that.
---
I was a bit more focused on PvP myself but I found myself to be successful with mining, engineering. alchemy, herbalism. I dabbled a little bit in skinning/leatherworking but that was shortly before I quit playing.
---
I know since your question is specifically raiding I guess I would say alchemy but as usual try to go with someone not common in your group of players/guild.
---
I'm not looking for advice on what to roll. I already know I'll be maining Ret and alting Enh. Just wanted to ask why there don't seem to be any Shamans doing BGs in the beta.
---
This wasn't legend.  AV's lasted 30+ hours all the time.
---
if you think arena is esports friendly I have some bad news for you
---
I've never seen 2h fury before, bloodthirst does damage based off AP not weapon damage, why would you ever want a want a 2h for fury.. that's like duel wielding arms using MS with a 1h..
---
SM/Ruin is always going to be popular for both pve and PvP though, and they spec deep into affli so they will utilize three primary dots in PvP. With the odd immolate thrown in.
---
please continue
---
It's also absolutely amazing in Arathi Basin, since you can shadowmeld at the point, then wait for people to come in thinking it's clear and you can get the drop on them.
---
This is so accurate lol
---
Quinn was playing Ret and got owned so bad he deleted his paladin. Rets with the proper 2hander and some RNG with Seal of Command can do some decent RNG burst with the berserking buff in WSG, but beyond that they can at least bring 2 CC (HoJ and Repentance) which are both 6 second CCs.
---
Burst would probably be waiting for a crit then HoJ-&gt;Seal/Judge-&gt;HoW or something I guess. An actual ret can probably explain it better X(
---
I like the way you see things. I personally would like more npcs and more lore in each town. More boutiques and more quests lore wise.
---
 Also more dungeons and raids with a challenging 60 content.
---
Remember it's leveling and gearing, and whatever gold I use for the account I have to farm which takes time(about 50g/hour). If I'm going to pvp I'd want at least good dungeon gear and epic mount.
---
If you get 2 each level and you start with 2 doesn't that add up to 12?  
---
55 = 2  
---
56 = 4  
---
57 = 6  
---
58 = 8  
---
59 = 10  
---
60 = 12
---
Well this thread was about dual spec. One for raiding/pve and one for pvp so I assumed this is what you meant.
---
The current policy that you say there seems perfect to me. I've been really enjoying all the footage from beta and it seems like it's mostly coming from streamers.
---
Healing the kultirans is such a troll move, I love it.
---
Not that human doesn't generate more threat, but you do realize all tanks regardless of race can/will be hit capped, because shield slam still requires it. Right?
---
The true advantage of weapon skill is the glancing blow damage reduction, something that only effects white damage (of which is the smallest component of threat especially on fights where you're rage capped.....like vael).
---
Because fishing is boring and what is the point of spending dozens of hours min/maxing at the current level 30 cap? If they don't raise the cap then you will have wasted your time. If they do raise the cap then you'll replace everything you worked for in a matter of hours.
---
Spending 18 hours fishing in the Beta? No thanks, I'll save my energy for Release.
---
about what?
---
I didn't know that, quite interesting.
---
Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily true, especially for feral/resto etc. I know rogues can have multiple viable PvP specs as well, they are slight variations, but ultimately different. I think the fact that people do play unoptimal builds already means you will still see variety even with dual spec. Otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt ever see a ret paladin because healing spec is vastly superior to ret for PvP.
---
Adding on to this....
---
In vanilla if I get the best pvp kits to form battleground rewards. How does that compare with tier 1 or 2 kits?
---
Dude, I miss the initial difficulty of Cata Dungeons, or any previous expansion for that matter, Cata and backwards. Scratch that, Wrath and Backwards, pre LFG patch.
---
Nefarian phase 3. 40 people use sapper charge on adds. Phase 3 over.
---
This feels like the wow equivalent of Fortnite's covered bridges
---
Gotcha thanks for the info!
---
You remember that rating is a group activity, a social activity, and usually involves working together to make sure all professions needed are covered. So you wait until you find your guild
---
I am pretty salty cause the spec I will have to play in pve on my warlock is unusable in pvp.  I will have to see how things play out or just level an alt class to pvp on.
---
Its not about blood thirst but about your auto attacks with flurry.
---
Theres even a fury pve spec with 2 handers. Its apparently better than dual weilding for a brief period of time. Requires a weapon like bonereaver tho. Its what theses guys were running.
---
More like 1.5 races
---
We had arena skirmishes one the TBC patch came around. Was fun but without matchmaking it was a lot of stomping just throughout sheer gear difference.
---
Thanks for the advice man.
---
Knocking that casting bar back
---
The ashbringer was made by Magni instead of Timolain and players never got it.
---
Khadgar has atiesh and players never got it.
---
The Outlands as it appears in WC3 and likely how it was originally planned wasn‚Äôt as diverse. It was just hellfire with some of the mushroom trees from Zangarmarsh. The fact that Nagrand and Terrokar exist mostly unscathed undermines the motive of the original orcish invasion.
---
I don‚Äôt believe there was ever any mention of orcs being originally brown before Burning Crusade. When Grom drinks the demon blood in WC3 he turns red, not more green. Moreover, orcs‚Äô greenness is probably based on the typical fantasy orc trope and likely wasn‚Äôt planned to be an indicator of demonic corruption.
---
Darnassus, according to the night elf intro cinematic, is a fairly new development caused by druids attempting to make another world tree. Some cataclysm quest text seems to indicate blizzard forgot this.
---
Some furbolgs appear in WC3 named ‚Äúpandaren‚Äù in Northrend. In WC3 the pandaren bremasters were added. This suggests that most pandaren are savages without a notable civilization and the more sociable brewmasters are an exception.
---
Silvermoon City was totally decimated in WC3 and the few surviving elves from that area followed Kael‚Äôthas into the Outland. In BC, it‚Äôs revealed that the area is mostly okay somehow. 
---
The Forsaken in Vanilla are an unfortunate people (hence their name) struggling to survive and find their purpose in the world. They‚Äôre distrusted even by their allies and must prove they no longer seek death and destruction to the living civilizations. They have sinister instincts and methods but as a whole they seem a lot less evil than WotLk onwards. It really doesn‚Äôt make sense how Sylvanas now wants to end all life and everyone on the horde seems ok with this. 
---
I‚Äôm sure they changed some lore about the emerald dream but I don‚Äôt know the recent story about it enough to say for sure.
---
Others have already mentioned the Draenei. In vanilla the ‚ÄúDraenei‚Äù appear in swamp of sorrows as what was retconned to the ‚ÄúBroken‚Äù. 
---
There‚Äôs probably more but that‚Äôs all I can think of now.
---
31/0/20 Shaman is really what peaks my interest. Just unsure if the loss of Mana Tide Totem is too much of an issue or if I can simply be in the melee groups.
---
Inputs?
---
I've been working on my first playthrough of Breath of the Wild.
---
Solo min/maxers are just screwing themselves over anyway (PVE).  Everyone doing the same cookie cutter specs/builds just leads to a lot more gear competition in an environment that had the lowest gear drops per raid week ever.
---
MC started off with an average of 0.5/player BoP Epic drops each raid (or 1 drop per person every 2 raids) on average.  It was buffed about 50% at some point in Vanilla, but regardless, the drops are much lower than subsequent expansions.  10 man Kara had \~2.5 drops per person per run (everyone pretty much got anything they needed in 3 months or less).  10 man Naxx averaged over 5 drops per person per run (everyone got what they needed in 6 weeks or less).  I believe 10 man naxx had the highest drops per person per run of any raid ever; blizz decreased raid drops when Ulduar came out.  All these numbers are straight averages, not accounting for duplicate drops, etc.
---
In a low gear acquisition rate per week environment like Vanilla, it's better to leave yourself flexible and not get so caught up on theoretical min maxing.  People backing themselves into a corner like that may look good on paper, but they'll just end up with less because they're all competing with each other more than normal.
---
Heh, when Eye of Rag dropped in my guild last year, it had to be forced onto someone. No one wanted to invest the 5k gold it takes to complete a PVP weapon that'll be replaced by AQ40. I doubt they ever crafted it.
---
But you're right it takes political saavy to get a Hand of Rag, it will be popular in Classic for the status symbol alone. If OP can become an officer/class lead in his guild and announce that  Hand of Rag his is mission from day 1, most people would be totally fine with a Shaman taking it.
---
You can download the client and create characters a few weeks in advance, I hope they use that info to add servers if needed.
---
You dont think people who never played wow are interested in classic wow?
---
Dark souls is popular because ofnits difficutly and all modern MMOs are mindless grindfests 90% of the time. Classic wow will be a place many people who want an old style MMO will come to
---
What changes did they make to the mailbox?
---
But if the guild really needs repair bots, you shouldn't love the guild (because of mass wipes)
---
It's a bug, quit the circlejerk.
---
So, 
---
Since the wow and the class are made to be balanced... Why is that hunter drop off as many people say?
---
&gt;Also, if you want to gripe about class balance, BC was equally notorious for issues with classes being excluded from raids because of their spec or even just being melee vs ranged. "Sorry, we already have a melee DPS for Kara, we can't take any others." BC was just as bad.
---
Okay, heres the problem though I'm trying to get at which I obviously didn't make clear enough.
---
If the community isn't open to the devs doing live balance updates different from what they were in Vanilla than we're going to be spinning the same wheel for years and years, whereas if we're open to the idea of Devs being able to step in and retroactively balance a spec or class where they weren't viable before, then we can enjoy the game with any class / spec regardless of the timelines continuity.
---
Basically, if balance is an ongoing process then it doesn't matter what it WAS like.
---
They have separate dev teams, and share the same subscription. To say that they are competing with each other, or that people think one is threat to the other is nothing but delusion from your end. Are you going to start worrying that classic is dying if the next retail expansion pulls more twitch viewers? I know that I won't. Nobody cares about twitch numbers, and they will both feed into each other anyway. Games go through peaks and troughs, WoW especially does this when new alpha/beta, expansions and patches come out before settling down. If you seriously think that people are hoping for a 8.2 sub bounce, then your are yet again delusional. The only people who care about it are Blizzard, and they don't even announce the numbers anymore, and they already got their sub bounce from the classic beta anyway. A WoW sub is a WoW sub. Blizzard doesn't care if you play retail, classic or both, they get the same amount of money from you anyway. This narrative that the two are competing for the communities and Blizzard's attention is nothing but the child of delusional fanboys and idiots. 
---
&gt; I would advise that retail-first players are not likely to get a warm welcome over here.
---
And that is why anyone with a functioning brain thinks that this subreddit is a shithole.
---
Sm/ruin is raid viable and not terrible in pvp i mean youre not soul link tanky but youre like a shadow specced mage.
---
Isn't one of the materials for the repair bot a drop from a mob that only has 3 spawns in STV?
---
I‚Äôm very very judgmental
---
* **Graveyards and graveyard capture points are now at different locations.** The banners players must interact with in order to capture a graveyard have been distanced from each other somewhat in order to alleviate "graveyard zerging" and make graveyards more meaningful to both defense and offense.
---
* **NPC difficulty has been scaled down. All NPCs have had their power reduced by 15-30%.**
---
I think these were the two changes that most people hated, with the NPC nerf being the worst.
---
These work on endgame bosses? I always have that idea when I get the bag of marbles but often forget about them or just say "eh fuck it" and sell them somewhere along my journey.
---
I'll actually save them this time around, heh.
---
The funny thing is, I've been actually sick for two weeks already so I can play stress tests at least. But damn if only I had beta...
---
Holocowst for tauren shaman.
---
Not every class should be topping the meters.
---
If the bonus damage from Trueshot Aura was credited to the hunter, then we would be saying they are the top DPS class.
---
Chronicles is full of retcons.
---
Need to level your bow skill somehow
---
I was raiding on a healer and i can count on one hand the amount of time i had a shaman in my healer group for mana tide.
---
All the shamans we had were put in the mdps and tanking groups.
---
My favorite comment so far. I think that'd be a great idea. I think the resilience stat is required for competitive arena but it'd be a lot of fun to have a structured arena setting with no added benefits to mess around with
---
So has my 1080 at 240hz
---
I get burnt out easily too and really, really want to make it to 60 to raid this time.  Every time I play a private server I get to 45ish and stop playing.  I'm very excited for Classic to come out and am not going to stop until I get to 60 and down Ragnaros.
---
Mandatory LFR but just for you.
---
I play Dota2 with a friend who also waits for Beta or release .. we dont play Dota cuz we rlyrly want to atm we just play cuz we wanna do stuff together ... classic ruined us
---
I reported it just in case.
---
&gt;/r/wow: Class identity is gone and everyone plays the same way now. This sucks!
---
Said no1 with a brain.
---
Specs can be viable while retaining identity.
---
Being able to switch between 2 specs doesnt remove class identity.
---
That sounds really promising! Thanks a lot man
---
I had the same thoughts as you. I've just created [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowlatenight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowlatenight/)
---
Well, it might hold more value now, since it could take months to a year before we see AQ.
---
I will be playing ds/ruin
---
&gt; Gear progression worked fine in classic without a complete reset
---
What happens when AQ is finished and there is no more left for them to add in classic?
---
You're essentially going to be stuck doing the same thing with no reason left to play, but yeah gear progression is bad tho right?
---
**Benevolent Elephants**. A US Alliance, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
‚Äã
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don‚Äôt plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.‚Äã
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people‚Äôs time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a ‚ÄúB Team‚Äù more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of ‚ÄúA Team‚Äù Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a ‚ÄúB team‚Äù raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: 2 raid nights to be decided once majority get close to 60. However they will be 2 of Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursdays. (With a possible 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: Also to be decided once majority get close to 60, but somewhere in the 6:30pm-12am PST range. For 3-4 hours
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord

Alliance were upset that it was 50/50 win/loss ratio and whined until Blizz moved the Horde spawn point, so now it's 90/10 in favor of Alliance.
---
Their argument was that Horde could run out and turtle at a GY and, using the newly introduced Reinforcement system, almost never lose. It wasn't as bad as Alliance made it out to be, but Blizzard loves them some Alliance, so they got what they wanted.
---
I think there are still 2 or 3 BG's in modern Retail that have same or similar W/L for Alliance, but there is one for Horde now as well.
---
STV and Stonetalon where it drops from mobs i think. Target dummies also drop them though, so that might be a option too.
---
Wasn't there like a 30 day cooling off period in Vanilla when you transferred that you couldn't transfer again? I'd imagine they'd probably do something similar.
---
The whole point of wow CLASSIC is for people who want to play the way it was.
---
Thats how it was. Get used to it or play Live or a Private server.
---
Pve is not necessarily raiding. I just plan to run 5 mans and pvp cause I wont have time to raid. Regardless this is the same attitude that everyone has when they tell hybrids that they will be useless unless they heal. That is only true in raiding. And even then not every guild will be going for server firsts and speed runs. Shit I played a resto druid during vanilla and I can tell you I was way more useless than any off spec class cause I was a bad player.
---
Iirc traps also have 30 sec
---
16 is completely different from 9. Way to grasp at straws that don‚Äôt even defend your argument. Lmfao. I also never said kids can‚Äôt play games. Thinking with that 9 year old brain of yours.
---
&gt;LOfuckingL
---
What the hell is this.
---
Regarding anything that you say about retail as in BFA. A completely new player will find BFA fun and engaging. Probably because they're not massively burned out. This is not the only reason why person finds no fun in a game but it is always the less considered reason.
---
BFA is not objectively better or worse, it is different, and a blizzard can't do a thing about how much we choose to play their game and burn ourselves out.
---
I'm a nooby retail player so sorry if this question is dumb, but how many servers will classic have? How many does the beta have?
---
You pick engineering because it's amazing and then consider if you need a profession to make gold or if you can manage without (and then go something for the guild like blacksmith). You probably gonna need a profession to make gold. 
---
The main options are skinning, mining and herbalism. Skinning is great while leveling, and if you are able to do devilsaurs(need some friends, pvp spec and good at it), then skinning is quite nice for that. Mining is great because as a warrior you need like 40 arcanite bars for your early gear, and when diremaul comes out there's a good gold making method in DME where you kill bosses with a healer, you need mining for that. Herbalism works well with pvping because pre phase 3 and even after when in queue, you run around and kill people in the world, and you can pick some flowers in the meantime. Felwood is very great for this as horde for example. It's actually quite common to see warriors doing all 3 of these professions in a lifecycle. Skinning+mining until 60, then drop one for engineerng, and later drop the other for herbalism.
---
Duskwood holds a real special place in my heart. I love that zone. So creepy and dark.
---
Yo don't forget to get reckoning
---
this constant retail vs. classic mentality is so stupid and it's ultimately only going to hurt both games.
---
Am I the only one who plans on playing and enjoying both? Classic is gonna be perfect for killing time between BFA updates lol
---
Zeroed is much much better than Themechanic though tbf
---
How does one go about getting on a pserver?
---
First of all, thanks for taking the time to explain the mechanics/formulas. 
---
In case you need another example for research: [https://youtu.be/EITksIO5aA8?t=667](https://youtu.be/EITksIO5aA8?t=667)
---
Curious on how this will all work out on release.
---
1.5 AV released
---
1.8 AV had the number of NPC reduced and the difficulty of NPC reduced by about 30%
---
1.10 AV removed more NPC
---
1.11 AV removed more Guard NPC and reduced HP of NPC
---
So by 1.12 the zone had been nerfed so much that each opposing side could completely ignore the other and rush straight to the final boss without doing any of the objectives or having to clear any guard NPC.
---
I have to respectfully disagree. Not having cast bars really is a unique and fun detail in classic that alows for some cool 200IQ plays. For example a shaman baiting a kick with a hearth stone cast instead of a healing wave. It also adds a slight layer of complexity to raiding and dungeons (which is needed since most raids are relatively easy nowadays) bc interrupts have to be looked for and not just handed to you via a large obvious cast bar.
---
As if the point of beta wasn't to find as many bugs and exploits as possible. Dude pls.
---
Lmfao, cmon man. What does a survival hunter do that any other spec can't?
---
What about a balance druid, or a feral druid? or a ret pally or a prot pally?
---
Prot can't tank in dungeons or raid all that well because they didn't have a fucking taunt, a simple SIMPLE buff would be to give them a taunt to allow them to be played in the end game.
---
&gt;  Why is there so little love for hunters?
---
Less flashy than a Warrior or Rogue so there's less epic PVP videos made for them. PVE wise, new hunters are famous for not dismissing their pets and wiping the group. Or multishotting CC targets, etc. It's just a meme.
---
&gt; I know it's extremely fun to play class but how are they in PVP?
---
Godlike from day 1. Your pet alone can solo most classes while leveling. At 60 they stay very strong. Viper Sting is one of the most important debuffs in the game, and you can 3 shot unsuspecting healers at 41 yard range.
---
Hunters are also up there with mages for having one of the most profitable gold farms in the game (solo mara/DMT instance farming)
---
Auto loot, dear god.
---
Hell yeah! The world PvP will be fun as fuck with level 10.
---
And at least I'll level something different than on the previous stress test. I mean 10 levels still isn't something that would take forever.
---
Yeah, tbh it's strange they didn't move that over too.  I mean, it's just a calendar.  I don't think it breaks "muh classic nostalgia immersion" that much given the utility it provides.
---
Well I don‚Äôt think there should be a debuff limit in the first place so that‚Äôs another discussion.
---
With the debuff limit in place however, it sounds like the spec you want to play isn‚Äôt great for raiding. So you have to go with a hybrid spec to make up for that.
---
Or pay the respec costs to be able to switch whenever you want. But the point is I don‚Äôt think people should be able to switch whenever easily with no drawback. If you spec into something there should be some commitment.
---
I think the best solution would be like a 5-10g cost to respec 5 talent points. That way you have some leeway with talents without having to shell out 50g for a full respec.
---
nah. i got eso a couple weeks ago and have been really enjoying it. i also picked up hearthstone again after 3 years of not playing. dusted all my wild cards and was able to make some pretty good decks. but i will not touch either of them once classic is out :)
---
Agrees. Plus there would be lots of cool ways to improve in game travel.
---
Factions can spend resources collectively to improve roads that provide MS while on them.
---
Create and maintain additional oddity flightpath.
---
More boats more docks. More direct cross continent transits.
---
I like how people throw in that someone is mad like it disproves the point they're trying to make. Theyve literally got nothing else when the umad shit comes out
---
Off topic some but this reminds me of Raid wipes where they'd BoP me the Hunter I'd feigen death, or SS me, the use goblin jumper cables to get the healer up. Those were good times.
---
Maybe there will be an addon for that :P
---
The lich king fight is the best one experientially. It's no contest.
---
Preach. I windfury totem and then alt tab MSN Messenger for the rest of the fight.
---
It's really a great start to the game, along with STV when it isn't cancerous with corpse camping.
---
For me the vanilla leveling experience goes side ways around 40 when as an alliance I have to go to Kalmidor.  I really struggle going from 40-50.
---
Yeah man, keep using the age argument, we all know why you're here instead of playing fortnite. You got stomped on by a 9yr old and are embarrassed.
---
F that, there's no way they should be doing that. If you want Vanilla WoW, you get Vanilla WoW.  And Blizzard absolutely doesn't want to be balancing two versions of WoW. That's an utterly slippery slope for Blizzard.  The moment they start adjusting those classes (pissing off every single person who wants an authentic BC experience in the process) suddenly they're stuck trying to make sure everything is right.  Which means possibly balancing bosses and gear as well.  There is no way Blizzard wants that when they're trying to fix BFA as well and plan for the next expansion.
---
They do, and it's not a niche in the grand scheme of things, it's just raids. Shamans can oneshot people in PvP and paladins are pretty good. When it comes to solo and utility they bring many things. This reddit is toxic for reason an im one of these toxic particles. In the end, you get similar threads 20 times a day. People simply ask before they use the "search" bar. And if you are like me, and follow these boards you notice a pattern. Everyone wants something different. I hope you can see where the problem lies and why people are aggressive more more often than not, when it comes to these.
---
We will see :)
---
What if the healer needs a mana break? Rage doesnt last forever.
---
Less NPCs, less quests, areas removed and raid bosses removed.
---
Awesome!
---
So you're saying people can't speculate?  That's a pretty big statement since every single company has to speculate on every single decision they make.
---
I'm actually thinking about it myself. Just don't know, if I should wait for Reforged or just play it now.
---
That's how I feel. My goal in mind is to level a paladin to 60 again, get t2 and heal all raids but focus on the legendary hammer for ret pvp.  
---
I found myself having to take breaks from things, instead of questing go to some pvp for awhile, professions, or respec a whole new role and quest that way to change things up. The only thing about vanilla wow is you quest a lot and questing gets very repetitive and boring for me. I definitely will not be remotely close to the first level 60's but I hope within a week I can be there, otherwise this vacation time i'm taking off is pointless lol.
---
Literally unusable. Thanks for NOTHING.
---
/s
---
&gt; Blizzard absolutely doesn't want to be balancing two versions of WoW
---
Implying Blizzard cares about retail anymore.
---
It's not really common knowledge if it's something you feel the need to explain.
---
Seriously, I remember grinding AV tep to get the frost wolf back in the day because I couldn't afford the epic mount and didnt realize that farming would've been quicker lol
---
I agree. As a casual knowing that I have to git good to actually even see some content is really motivating. If I can just do the easy version it takes away a lot of my need to get better gear and improve.
---
My eyes were really opened recently with the release of Mortal Kombat 11. People were getting really pissed that they were getting stuck and having a difficult time with The Gauntlet (static difficult content) after like a week. I'm happy that there is content that I will probably never be able to complete, it is something to strive for and for those that can they get to show off the sweet skin from completing it.
---
Not all content should be doable by everyone.
---
Good rebuttal. Everything you say reinforces the fact you‚Äôre 9.
---
Name does not check out.
---
if its a perfect match it only fuc ks with the initial instant and not the full second!
---
In what regard is fury 2h viable? When you have a MS warr already?
---
I will be in the next day or 2. Got a late invite but I'm gonna hit 30 tonight and then get some more gear and start doing BG's with it to see how it works out.
---
I couldn't figure how to get a gun to shoot on my rogue. I had equipped the gun and ammo to my character, but didn't realize the Shoot skill from the skills tab needed to be added to my bar (not the gun itself). When I asked a buddy of mine, he asked if I picked up a "flintlock" from the general goods vendor. I must have went to 3 or 4 different vendors, but none of them had it. When I asked him about it, he told me he was just messing with me, and told me about the shoot skill.
---
I DIDNT GET INTO BETA FUCK THIS  
---
sorry for using the F word i was pretty mad for a second there
---
There will always be fans crying out that the next expansion is their favorite and they would like to see it. That will happen after Wrath. It's a completely legitimate ask, and it's logical to assume that we are back at the beginning and we know where we are going.
---
At least you won't be a spell clicker.
---
Pff, costs ingredients. The professional paladin places his heathstone nearby and bubbleports out. You can seriously cut down your costs if you combine the two options.
---
Bit iffy on PVP servers as you might be slower as the corpserun and delay the raid.
---
Man, thanks. That's really encouraging. I'm not so into the macro level stats etc and just wanna have fun playing. But it's just disheartening when I read things online and people complain or compare the hunters.... So many posts I saw people talk about classes and for hunters.... 
---
"hunters = lol. "
---
Can confirm, my wife had an ally mage but all my char were Horde.
---
Sorry but no. There has only been talk from Blizzard that TBC would be next followed by wrath. They have not talked or even hinted towards making new content for classic. That‚Äôs not even on the table.
---
Transmog?
---
Well for pve you wanna be fury so we are speaking as 2hander fury being a pvp alternative for respeccing.
---
Private servers have that option. So I‚Äôm sure classic does as well.
---
Glancing blows does not happen on yellow hits like heroic strike, so it's actually not that big of a deal. What is a big deal however is the 3% hit you gain from 300-&gt;305 weapon skill, which helps you get hitcapped without hurting too many of the other stats. Remember TPS is all about getting the maximum out of your gear, you want as much threat while still staying tanky enough, getting 3% free hit allows you to wear more tanky gear without losing damage, or allows you to get more crit without losing tankiness. Every stat counts even if you are going to cap that stat eventually. 
---
If you are a profession tank that knows how to duel-wield tank however it becomes massive with the offhand rage regeneration.
---
Incredible
---
Oh yea I should‚Äôve read through the sub a bit before posting. Haven‚Äôt gotten many positive comments lol. I did get the answers I was looking for though!!
---
On PVE you can roll both factions.
---
Welcome to classic WoW :)
---
wait what the fuck, i had no idea! warlock seems perfect thematically for trolls
---
Im just trying to give the people another option, but as usual, all of this turned in to a shit show :D
---
How so? How does me paying to go from night elf to human once every 60 days ruin that?
---
It wasn't patch 1.12, the last major changes to AV in vanilla were in patch 1.11.  And those changes were the final batch of NPC removal/nerfs as well as some grave yard changes.
---
&gt;But if I can survive the suffering of 100s of allianve ganks
---
Just keep surviving and prepare for vengeance when you'll hit max level and get geared. Warlocks can be monsters in WPvP.
---
Okay I'm out of the loop. Will classic wow launch with wsg/ab/av?
---
I am only explaining it because you asked...  Next time someone asks me something I'm just going to tell them to fuck off.
---
I'd say a more fitting comparison is a Safari VS Themepark
---
Sad no invites til after Stress Test ;(
---
Shamans at 30 are really lackluster
---
At 60 enhance needs luck and above average gear to DPS people down. Elemental needs slightly less gear but is better overall (imo) in PvP. With really good gear they can near one shot.
---
I absolutely came down with appendicitis during the hours of the stress test/open server. My heart was crushed along with my infected appendix. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem like I would have got in anyway. 
---
Redemption will be mine on the 29th!
---
As a Frost Mage (assuming keeping Ice Barrier up while out in the world) I would think you would be able to kite and CC a rogue and win that fight, but its been a long time since I played vanilla
---
&gt;a lot of people will discover how much easier the content is
---
Everyone discovered this the day patch 1.11 was introduced
---
They nerfed everything, that's all it is, lol
---
That was because of reinforcements not the 1.11 AV changes.
---
I know right?! I even give Arcane Intellect buff to warriors like they need it!! :D I love buffing!
---
Thanks, I really hope so.
---
I think it would be much cooler to see some cooperative esports pvp on this scale vs the smaller arena teams. I think it would be hard to pull off but damn, that would be fun to watch.
---
That 40 ally vs 30 horde though... You still won.
---
Was 3960 honor a lot back then?
---
That Senn dude on ally had almost doubled every else honor at 7326.
---
The gear you get from PvP (R12+) is very good and on par with T2 for the most part; at least for PvP. As GrokFu said the weapons from R14 are the best you'll get for a long time. It is super time consuming to get to R14 though.
---
My point is, this is NOT Classic, it was vanilla. Balance is fluid and can be changed to reflect a better experience.
---
I haven't seen an official confirmation pass by but you miss the point of the post. What's after?
---
The ret should be holy and the enhancement shaman should be 30/0/21 then they're both super effective in pvp.
---
Idk about this enh/ret comparison... they're both pretty easy to counter by most classes.
---
It's a goof.
---
The fucks wrong with you lol.
---
Blizzard is giving the community what we've been begging for, for years.. and you want to whine about the state of current WoW? 
---
Hold on.. let me check the store..
---
Nopes. Store is All Out of fucks. I'm afraid I can't give one.
---
Oh wait! There's a vending machine over there. We're in luck! It has a fuck left! And I just happen to have a dollar. I might be able to give a fuck!
---
..
---
Oh no! The fuck got stuck.. I'm afraid I just can't give a fuck..
---
But you have a nice day now.
---
Hahahha no. /equip came with tbc. 
---
There was a script (/run UseContainerItem(bagIndex, bagSlotIndex)) you can use that targets a specific bag slot (or use an addon for using the name).
---
Auto loot is in, it was already in vanilla anyways, only the option for not having to press shift is new.
---
The only people getting banned here should be the nooby horde team.
---
I would be interested in seeing that macro.
---
Im not gonna be an asshole who ganks lowbies for no reason. 
---
I'm honestly suprised pvp is so popular when all I've seen so far is ganks from people 6-30 levels higher than me. 
---
I don't get it.
---
Hear hear brother.  My little guy is 6 months old now, but before he arrived I saw the writing on the wall and quickly invested in a new gaming laptop and consolidated all my favorite games onto the Switch.  It's a solid combo for fatherhood gaming :)
---
Yeah, Enhance is in a really sad state in 1.12. Have fun, but don't get your hopes up.
---
Yeah that's very true.  If you just quest for 6 days straight you'll get to 60, but that's sitting there for 6 days /played straight.  That's just way too much time questing.
---
Dude, you are a fucking legend :D
---
You can yeah.
---
Could you get this and wear it at level 20 when the quest becomes available? It says ‚ÄúItem Level 33‚Äù but I‚Äôm unsure if that‚Äôs a rating or the required level to wear it.
---
Anyone can get away with missing a few raids. RL obviously has priority to games. Just be a decent person and let your raid lead know you wont be attending.
---
If your raid bars you from raiding with them because you missed 2 raids.
---
You should find better people to play with.
---
You pick engineering. End of story
---
Fishing is a great money maker too. I think a good 60% or more of my gold likely came from fishing.
---
sounds like retail is what you are looking for
---
Classic is a recreation to the best of their ability of vanilla
---
Classic could have been different but thats not the direction they decided to go with it
---
All speculation is based on some form of data. Him thinking guild banks won't impact Classic is based on ***NOTHING.***
---
Considering the amount of money Retail WoW brings in for them?  Yeah, they care. And it's utterly brainless to think otherwise, both from a financial perspective and from a development perspective.
---
Look, you can say, with your 24-25 year old perspective: "Oh, lulz, they don't care about retail WoW because it turned out poorly."  That would also be idiotic. BFA's leveling experience, IMO, was one of the best I've experienced.  I rather enjoyed it.  But the end game and classes were garbled. They made mistakes.  That doesn't mean they don't care.
---
In life, making mistakes doesn't equate to "I don't care." You will make some pretty heavy mistakes in whatever career you choose / have chosen. That doesn't mean you didn't care.  It means you made a mistake.  Whether that mistake is misreading data, misinterpreting feedback, etc.  
---
I firmly believe the people working on WoW care about the game.  It might not fall in line with what I think the game should / could be, but I won't say they don't care. And it'd be utterly stupid to think the execs don't care when WoW is bringing in some hefty revenue.  The moment they say "lulz, w/e, just do something" is the moment they lose a LOT of money.  
---
It's so easy to just point and say "they don't care" simply because something didn't turn out well.  I've been part of projects that just failed, and I can tell you in those projects everybody f'ing cared.  The people working on Titan, within Blizzard, cared.  In some regards, they cared too much about their ideas and it hurt the project. 
---
I hate this knee-jerk reaction gamers have to point and proclaim "no passion, they don't care."  It's just brainless drivel, and it shows that someone isn't even trying to use the brain they have.

I would like Classic WoW to continue where it left off. No major changes (complete Talent System rework), but tweak the numbers so things like Enhance Shamans and Balance Druids are at least viable specs.
---
I've played a Hunter and here's my thoughts on why there is no love for them:
---
-easy to mess up. In a group you can easily mess up the day by forgetting to turn off taunt on your pet and forget to unsummmon it. 
---
-PvE rotation is easily messed up by new players well as most new people will clip their autoattacks and not know that multishot is better than viper sting, which leads to poor dmg
---
-frost trap is unreliable. Getting one off in the beginning of a pull is one thing but feign death+trap macro doesn't always work. Better to go with a Mage for CC. 
---
-end game damage scaling is poor. 
---
-same gear as rogue/dps war but worse dmg. Tanks aren't too happy with a Hunter in their group and Rogues aren't either, both being the most played classes which also do more dmg. I would say a lot feel entitled to the gear over a Hunter due to them "doing more dps" with it.
---
-Hunters are great at PvP by default with a BM spec and everyone hates being slowed and having a pet that they can't CC chase them down
---
I could go on and on. It's super fun for the player and the class is very needed but I do see why others don't like the class very much. It's the Hunter life!
---
TLD; Easy to be bad at. But also easy enough at allowing you to progress the levels while being bad.
---
Shaman don't get a bunch of totems or mail armor until later. Pretty gimped specs compared to other level 30 classes in beta.
---
We had hunters who legit went afk on trash and bosses just autoattacking and having their pet in. Didn't really notice it until dmg meters.
---
You need a sub to play on the test server if you got an invite
---
You're probably right, but since it is enabled on the beta right now I'm still holding out hope.  It'd be a nice treat to play a 'custom' version of WSG that'll never exist again after these tests are done.  All level 10s, minimal abilities.
---
&gt;VERY hardcore  
---
&gt; 6 hours a day 
---
Them's is rookie numbers, son. You got to pump them numbers up.
---
Especially since the pserver babies and circlejerkers repeat the "bringing more than 1 druid is a waste" meme
---
When in reality the guilds that keep 3-4 druids on the roster will end up doing better as they can gear up better, do good healing, and it turns out that innervates, brezzes, and decurses matter

---
Nobody knows what Blizzard will do. My preference is to TBC. No "Classic+" or anything like that.
---
The reason that private servers keep having ever lasting population is because of the constant fresh servers. If there was just some 3 year old server with all content out and people in full bis, people wouldn't play. That is evidenced by private servers.
---
It's nowhere near 10% healing lost. That 10% is of base excl. ur gear.
---
30/0/21 takes totem range?
---
If you mean AK 5% its...yeah... vs total mana over an encounter its not near 5%.
---
Ancestral could matter if you're tank healing and not using chain heal.
---
It's not THAT big a deal, and the very premise that you don't know that it isn't a flat 10% healing is a yikes to begin with.

---
Yes it is a specific option in the interface with a checkbox
---
How about you play the game, right? You beat Naxx, right? And ***THEN*** let's have this conversation.
---
As someone who main'ed a druid I can speak to the truth of this. While lvling feral I never had issues tanking low lvl stuff. Around 50s it started to become an issue so I strictly tanked, but continued to build my healing set as I wanted to MS resto anyway.
---
At 60 I switched to full resto and things were fine. Yes, every now and then I'd get turned down from healing something because I didn't have an actual rez, but I was always accepted for UBRS pugs when gearing up. My guild had no issues with me in MC, ZG, Ony, BWL, or AQ20/40 (guild fell apart during AQ so I never saw Naxx)
---
Personally I find the people who complain about druids the most are those that never played the class themselves or took the time to pay attention to the druids around them. We were certainly around and welcomed in most groups/guilds.
---
It was also nice playing a class so very few people played or even understood.
---
Knaack sucks. Read any of the Christie Golden books and it'll blow your mind how much better they are.
---
Just roll new servers like the privates did.
---
3mbps was pretty solid, even for the end of the winxp/winamp/mirc days. You had a nice connection ;o  
---
From what I can see, the global average today is like 8mbit, to download at 3 per second you need like a 20mbit connection, so its still more than double the average connection today lol :p
---
I'll record it tomorrow. Its literally like a .5 yard window.
---
Like your code link even says IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning
---
30%slow+ is walking so leeway isn't supposed to be active. That's the issue. Both not slowed ur correct 7.66 yards. 
---
Slowed 5-8 yards 
---
Leeway how ur stating doesn't work either. From what ur saying leeway is active so charge is now 11.6 yards minimum yeah. Let's assume that's correct what happens when the warrior stops moving? Leeway over and now suddenly he can charge? I can test this tomorrow too.
---
Sorry to necro the thread, but I've been researching how i want to spec my mage for the upcomming classic release and yours are the best explanation I've come around. When i watch people pvp in vanilla (i started in TBC) they use a lot of nova -&gt; CoC. Especially in 1vx. It seems like a big damage loss if you dont have improved CoC. Is there really nothing that can be cut? I know you touch upon it in the post, which was very well written, but maybe permafrost? Is the slow really that important? Thanks a lot!
---
 How about you play the game, right? You beat Naxx, right? And ***THEN*** let's have this conversation.
---
Not really. hunters beat mages and warlock all the way until 1.8, at that point they are even until hunters get beaten by warlocks/mages from 1.9 and so on.
---
But they are still ahead for over half of the game.
---
Would be kinda odd considering Classic is literally "Patch 1.13" when you log in and look at the version in the bottom-left of the title screen. But yes I do see what you're saying, but not everybody agrees, which is why conversations have to exist. No matter who wins, there'll be a side that is unhappy

They did back in the day. So unless blizzard changes it, but totally worth holding on to just in case.
---
Not if he wants to play resto...
---
Yeah...I'm sure it took him plenty of BG's for him to compile this video.  It's a highlight montage, not 1 WSG.  Enhance is pretty poop....I feel bad for all the people who are going to roll enhance just to realize its pretty terrible damage wise outside of a WF proc and VERY boring.
---
I know. I get it. But honestly if your guild is PvP focused and trying to get a bunch of rank 14s, it can make sense to have arms. It is MC. YOu take a small hit early on in your raid times but you save much more time and money for more important things.  The mages aren't fire so no ignite. Noone is swinging a nightfall around that early. There isn't really that many other important debuffs you are going to push off. You are basically playing with 15 debuff limit instead of 16 but it really doesn't matter in MC.  In the end, you are trading maybe 30 minutes of your MC clear time so that everyone saves 100 gold per week. Then they get r14 gear and you faceroll the rest of the game. Sounds like a decent trade off for me. 
---
Anyways, 90% of guilds aren't even going to be monitoring their debuffs, especially that early on.
---
Back in the day I two manned Shadowfang Keep as a Prot Paladin and he was a hunter. Mend Pet on a bear and an occasional Flash of Light and we just went slow as hell. But it was a blast!
---
This is what burned me out in Vanilla. I ended up with like 30 characters on multiple servers with the highest level being 40. Had to take a break from the game due to work, and didn't come back until TBC.
---
I'm almost done with finals/senior thesis and will be finishing the Witcher 3 expansions and probably giving Destiny 2 a try since I nabbed it when it was free a few months ago. Didn't care for how bungie managed the game but enjoy the sci fi space exploration of it
---
I understand what classic is, I'm not sure what you're trying to get across here. I'm just saying that my point is Classic could have been a better version of Vanilla instead of a straight up copy / paste.
---
Class balance is a huge issue and will likely be a big problem for players in the coming months.
---
‚ÄúEverything on the table‚Äù is not ‚Äúlet‚Äôs add wrath after naxx‚Äù. Not sure where OP is getting his information.
---
Pretty sure it's Ahn'Qiraj, not Quiraj
---
This is just patently false.
---
Personally, I NEVER click on streamer videos in this subreddit.  Remove them all, as far as I‚Äôm concerned.
---
I respect your decision on playing the minority class. What spec will you main?
---
PvE:
---
Fury Warrior, Sword Rogue, Frost Mage
---
PvP:
---
Arms Warrior, Sword Rogue
---
Ret can survive from CCs but Shamans only have to die
---
Private servers have shown us that interest does wane very strongly after naxx comes out. The reason the PS scene has lasted for 12 years is overwhelmingly because of the FRESH meta where people were constantly promised new, better, less buggy, less corrupt servers. Without that it's reasonable to think there will be a huge drop off in player interest after naxx is out. All the hardcore guilds quit once the game is 'solved' and then all the other raiding guilds quickly follow suit.
---
I've never heard of dual wield tanking?
---
I'm guessing you meant Naxx.
---
And hypothetically, I would have preferred that they added additional content without having such a catastrophic impact on the original content, just like I stated before.
---
Again, they could have used EQ as a reference here. The first expansion added an additional continent to the world. Yes it expanded the top end of the game and had a big focus on additional raid content, but it also added additional content for all stages of the game. And yes, the population spread out a bit as the world got larger but original content was still very relevant. When epic quests were introduced, they still required you to travel through the vanilla world and complete vanilla raid content.
---
I'm not sure why this is difficult to understand. It's totally possible to have expansions without resetting the entire game. Most MMOs did it that way.
---
&gt;you might be able to handle 2-3 even 4 mobs
---
There is only one class that can do that, its a mage or a warlock. Cmon dude keep dreaming no other class can do such a thing
---
They should if they take damage at least, which Bolvar should have after getting hit by the breath
---
If there‚Äôs no official confirmation, then how did you come up with the 3 possibility‚Äôs? 
---
What‚Äôs after classic? TBC. If you think they brought back classic so they could add new content then idk what to tell you.
---
it can still happen, it's just less often in 1.12. It wasn't really until TBC and reinforcements that long AVs were completely gone
---
Paladins having crusader strike. I hate that ret pallys aren't very viable
---
Lol locks are the absolute best for early and late pvp imo, nothing has utility like it. Health stone, curse that can counter each class, fear, drain life, sacrifice demon for shield. You name it they got it. Most of it before lvl 40. Also self soul stone for self revive
---
I don't give a fuck about your unironic opinion. Please never reply to my post again. Thank you.
---
Or...you could of got an invite and then the hype would for sure be gone by September. What scenario do you think is more likely to happen?
---
but endgame :P
---
I did 1-30 on a private server in 1 day 14 hours /played, so i'm hopping I can do 30-60 in an additional 3 /played days. But we'll see I'll probably be bored at level 30 again lol.
---
No just locks in general
---
So in other words...professions, trade chat, and guilds matter more than ever. Noted!
---
In T3 maybe.... soooo once the content is at its end.
---
Your PC hasn't even played any games yet and it's already on the losing side.
---
I see, I have overlooked a major factor: level 30 meta. Completely forgot about that. Ignore my second question then.
---
Yeah, it's like Ret. That 1% of the time when you got both a regular crit + Seal of Command crit proc was *amazing*. Even more so if you had Hand of Justice proc too. 
---
The rest of the time was hot garbage.
---
???? Not complaining. It's the current explanation for leeway issue.
---
If you want to destroy and have healer friends yes warrior 100% the buildup is slower but once you get there it's like you are level 62 going against 60s
---
Thanks, but is it really that simple? I'm focusing mainly on pvp but I do know that I will have to do pve to gear.
---
This is Vanilla
---
I know... that's the problem.
---
We are  living in a stupid society, that's why streamers are so popular. ;)
---
No, he was a starring role in wrath. In multiple cinematics as well as a big role in ToC.
---
Hit 60, start making money until the first surge of dungeoneers are level capped and ready to hit the 60 instances.
---
You've reminded me how annoying pserver minmaxers are going to be in classic.
---
If you do filters PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE remove the character limit on text posts; people who dont want simple questions can filter those out, and there are plenty of times I have a simple question that doesnt require a full paragraph explanation
---
I‚Äôve heard hunter is not that gear dependent, and you can always hide behind enemy lines and viper sting casters to get rid of they‚Äôre mana. They can also feign death and trap when people get into melee range. However getting a good bow seems very important to be able to kill people with ease without having to kite too much 
---
Warlock is a solid choice with a lot of CC and their dots can wreck people, and they become godly when they get good gear. 
---
So I‚Äôd say hunter for more casual play, and if you enjoy kiting and warlock for a more serious player that can spend time gearing up. 
---
I was in my early days thinking about hunter as well instead of spriest but I feel like I will enjoy spriest a little more.
---
My plan is to get retro wow and try out both with just pre bis gear to see which one I like more. 
---
And my alt is going to be a rogue once battlegrounds open up so I can do low level pvp on them.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowlatenight](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowlatenight/)
---
For all those that want to that are either looking for a late night guild and want to play in your region, I created this subreddit. Especially for September and probably even October, the average guild won't have enough 60s to start doing MC so it would be useful if a lot of late night guilds chose the same server so we can combine raids for some time. It just makes a lot of sense for late night raiders to congregate to the same server.
---
Also here's there's already a subreddit for people that want to raid during day time: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowoffhours](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowoffhours)
---
If you intend to play day/late night and don't want to commit to a guild yet, it just makes sense to me to follow these subreddit and keep an eye out of which server the bigger day/late night guilds choose to play on. If you join a random server odds are strong you won't find a single guild raiding during the day or late night.
---
If you have to ask, you‚Äôre not even close to the 95% best.
---
You're absolutely right but you are arguing it in the wrong place.
---
vaguely related

i was watching a few old hobbs videos in one of the 07 ones he shows what youtube usto look like man it was such garbage

&gt;If you do filters PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE remove the character limit on text posts; people who dont want simple questions can filter those out, and there are plenty of times I have a simple question that doesnt require a full paragraph explanation
---
I think the problem here is whether or not he is telling people not to play hunter because they will get "stuck" in this role.
---
That statement would be outrageously false.
---
Horde versus Alliance argument aside, that is beautiful.
---
Boo
---
I'm a healer main and REALLY wanted to roll Holy Pally main but having no viable offspec has deterred my choice. I've decided on Priest since ret/prot pally don't make a substantial impact in classic. I feel you here
---
Don‚Äôt think I was top 5%, but. I loved being a (Human) lock at end game in both PVP (got to Lieutenant Commander) and PVE (C‚Äôthun before nerf/mounts, and up to Faerlina). Lots of groups want a lock as well.
---
Not creating a single alt.
---
Surely not in classic wow, but I believe I'm able to go there.
---
&gt; Then just like many things in WoW Blizz decided to cave to the QQ of a few players.
---
Do you really think it was just a few players that didn't want a BG lasting multiple days?  Some of the people in this community have such insane notsalgia-blindess that you've convinced yourself that Vanilla didn't have problems that the majority of people wanted changed.
---
Don't get me wrong, there is definitely fun to be had in the old AV's, but there were plenty of problems that came with it. Especially when it was imbalanced and one side was just getting farmed for hours and hours and the people getting farmed just wanted it to end to get their rewards. People also forget that in Vanilla the Report AFK system wasn't in place, so people would literally just sit afk in AV for honor. Not to mention the queue times.
---
People really need to stop dismissing genuine complaints as "a few ppl QQ'ing", and Blizzard making reasonable changes as them "caving to a few qq'ers". It's fine to prefer one thing over another, but it doesn't mean you're right and other people are wrong. As someone who enjoyed old wow, and has played on private servers, the unjustified elitist, and self-congratulating portion of the Classic community has always been a huge turn off.
---
Let's be real: The reason for Draenai was that the Broken ones did exist in WC3 lore anyway and they needed a new race for the outlands expansion that got enough lore to carry most of the questing content on outland.
---
But the Broken Ones were not pretty enough for an alliance race so thats why we got tentacle demon chicks.
---
Yup it's a thing.
---
Basically you wear duelwield for more threat. The cost is the ability to block and some armor. And then you have a macro to swap back to shield if you need. Skarm did a guide on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_azvBdVgz0 
---
It's a very tryhard method to get even more threat. It's a bit risky, but if done correctly you shouldn't die.
---
Why can‚Äôt they let the people who want to only play Vanilla stay on content frozen servers and let the developers that are no longer needed for those servers move on to add new content that sticks to certain pillars to not go down the road of what happened to retail. Don‚Äôt see how THAT is hard to understand.
---
It should be limited to elites not being elites anymore though, I don't think they ever changed normal mobs back then. If at all the differences should be rare at least.
---
I tried finding that option  during the stress test and couldnt find it. 
---
Granted I didnt look to hard so maybe I just missed it.
---
Look, I was just making a joke on the state of retail but in reality when we look at the problem of live balancing, Yes it's blizzard who is balancing two version of their game but there are likely 3 CORE teams at Blizzard who work on WoW.
---
- A Team 
---
- B Team
---
- Newly found C Team
---
The A team works on the better Expacs, this theory has been proven time and time again and their workflow process has been confirmed by Devs a couple times. They've got a team working on the current expac and a seperate team working on the new expac, the two teams talk but their designs are fundamentally different from the last one.
---
The B team, the lesser dev team who has a history of bad expac design.
---
The C team, the Classic team. These guys only work on Classic and likely do not touch retail projects at all, unless asked to personally look at something.
---
There is no reason for there to be a problem for Blizzard to live balance "two versions of their game" when they've got 5 games they're currently live balancing for at the moment. They handle these "versions" the same way they handle new IP's / games, a separate entire team.
---
You can have a Live balance team, and a Classic balance team with no crossover because there is no need for either of these teams to be communicating to each other.
---
Yes, warriors are unmatched in terms of dps until naxx.
---
Warriors with gear and a healer are also the best ones in PvP. Sword spec &amp; MS will oneshot anything with enough luck and have the highest pressure available.
---
We know for a fact clearing naxx comfortably doesn't require engineering at all, on any of your players. Many guilds will be perfectly content raiding 3 nights a week clearing all content and couldn't give a shit about speed running.   
---
So yeah I think it's safe to say most semi-serious guilds won't care at all what profession you are.
---
The ingame classes are somewhat only combined rpg classes. Nothing would be against a human picking up a gun and become a "hunter" (there are human archers,  or crossbow shooter guys, or even cannoneers in the game). The playable hunter class combines nature  druidic elements with that of the dwarven sharpshooter, and other units I previously mentioned. It is the same for other classes. Nathanos blightcaller was a human ranger as well. I think the developers just disliked the idea of this "Jack of all trades mix" playable hunter class and decided it does not really fit the humans which is true. Also not everyone that uses a gun automatically is aligned with nature and has an animal companion. That is just a game mechanic. There are too many of these game mechanic elements in the game that have nothing to do with the lore.
---
I mean it's common sense. If the point is to keep classic as classic then every expansion down the line is less *classic*. What I'm saying is that we discuss what we want to keep from classic as we move into next expansions, I'm not advocating for new content. 
---
The argument can be made that the most classic experience is developing new content with vanilla's systems.
---
How'd you get into beta?
---
Asking someone to not reply to your post one a public internet forum...
---
I'm not sure what you're using, but look for ways to maybe save the settings files or export functions.
---
Maybe not in P1
---
If we‚Äôre lucky they‚Äôll see how crazy big Classic is and model WoW 2.0 after that instead of what had currently been created with retail. 
---
Lmao let‚Äôs be real though they‚Äôll do the one that gets them the most money.
---
We aren't regardless. We're having the *massive* class revamps from day 1. That's already a completely different experience than vanilla. I guess you can't play now, eh? 
---
It's going to be a big fucking improvement, because original class trees were mindbogglingly stupid.
---
There's nothing wrong with fixing problems to make classic even better than vanilla. There's nothing wrong with classic being a better game than vanilla.
---
 &gt; semi-serious
---
I think you mean, extremely serious.
---
That's how it is on private servers. You cannot use vanilla data because 1.12 talents changes things massively.

Hello
---
\[Classic Squad\] is a Classic WoW community that will be based on a specific EU Alliance PVP server. The aim of this discord channel is to create a pool of players that you can advertise spots in your groups, based on the same server and by what you require.
---
Everyone has a specific role on discord corresponding to the class and spec they will play in classic. You can @ them to advertise what you need.
---
We are currently a community of around 20 people but are looking to expand for the convenience of everyone helping to find pre-made groups.
---
If you are looking to play on an EU Alliance PVP server you have nothing to lose, join today :)
---
**Please read MOTD**  
---
[discord.gg/ydmvCYR](https://discord.gg/ydmvCYR)
---
PS: This is not a guild, its a discord community.
---
Only free hks are bad players, not classes :)
---
&gt;  Their cash cow was losing its player base so they made moves to retain them.
---
Having played enhancement in multiple private servers, the ‚Äúluck‚Äù needed is highly over stated. If you fight 2 people it‚Äôs pretty much guaranteed to proc on one of them. People make it sound like you‚Äôre gonna go a whole WSG with only 3-4 wind fury procs.
---
Many cloth wearers will get 1 shotted
---
Or even if we do move to other expansions, are there systems that we want to keep in place?
---
U should hop on private with me.  That‚Äôs helping me get thru lol
---
It's there, disabled by default.
---
Definitely. I would want to be a ret pallys so bad but I feel like a lot of others just wouldn't accept me. Unless you're Esfand than it doesn't really work. But all my friends want to play horde anyway so it's not really an issue. Going restore druid
---
LOL so sad. Get out of classic, you obviously are extremely young. Stick to watching xqc and other spergs that make you feel at home, it's where people like you belong.
---
Steelsnap sends his regards.
---
Yea so I've understood it, but then I see things like a warr will never touch a good fmage. What I'm looking for is the class that will do the best against most classes I guess.
---
It's actually perplexing to me that people would rather keep requesting for recycled already experienced content, rather than keep everything that made Classic a fun experience, stay true to those philosophies and then continue on to brand new content, like an alternate universe WoW. A fresh slate, this time with mistakes to have learned from.
---
Just like spell batching
---
\[EU\] \[PVP\] \[H\]
---
I'm open to anything really, however, I am looking for a guild that isn't too hardcore, because let's be honest, we're all old and have jobs now.
---
I'm willing to adapt my schedule to suit raiding/events, however I will give you a quick rundown of my available times and hopefully we can come to some sort of arrangement. I work from 0630-1600 in the week, every day. Training BJJ on Mon/Tue/Thur 1700-1930 (approximate times) - Those days would also be my main play days, from 1945 to around 0000. I am willing to move my days around as much as I can to accommodate the right guild.
---
Any questions, feel free to hit me up. I intend to play an Orc Warlock with 0 vanilla raiding experience, however, I have played from the start of BC and know my class. I have dabbled in private servers so know my way around the class in vanilla.
---
That doesn't sound right, everyone else that has gotten the beta had an active sub, and I believe they said you had to be active. Had you canceled but still had some time left?
---
Google classic phases
---
Again, false. Look at the DPS meters at https://legacyplayers.com/
---
Hunters do not beat mages and warlocks. Hunter scaling is pitiful compared to caster classes.
---
The box u linked has item id 21228, which means that it was added  with 1.9 patch. So it shouldn't be in game yet.
---
MoP is when WoW truly lost its way
---
Yeah this has made me want to play on a pserver
---
As this isn't a scripting condition please defenders of, this is actually how it was, open up the 1.12 client and show us how you can see nameplates similar to this Legion new-age WoW command. Because I have my 1.12 client open and have yet to find this magical command people are claiming this as blizzlike.
---
Pretty sure he means dps wise, and he's right warlocks are pretty bad until they can start stacking hit which is around ZG patch
---
&gt; Good thing is up until i'd say DM, a pure dps spec warrior can toss a crappy shield on, go defensive stance and tank just fine all dungeons.
---
Nah, as long as the Warrior knows what they're doing, you can realistically tank every single non-raid dungeon with a 31/20 Arms/Fury spec. Or even 31/5/15 hybrid spec. And even in MC/BWL they perform just fine as a secondary tank with the right gear swap.
---
I somehow convinced my guild to let me run my Arms Warrior as my primary character from Hunter. Worked out well when we reached BWL content as Mortal Strike was super useful in the Ebonroc fight.
---
except the strawpoll saying that most players are going to roll a lock, so there will be so many of them they won't be able to find raid groups even with the 16 debuff slots.
---
I legitimately believe it was some form of the following:
---
    /cast Revenge
---
    /cast Shield Slam
---
    /cast thunder clap    
---
    /cast shield block    
---
    /cast heroic strike    
---
    /cast sunder armor
---
Or whatever the vanilla equivalent of that would be. It was like a reverse order of priority of buttons to push as a tank, so if revenge was up it would do that, but if no revenge, then it would shield slam etc....
---
It was really really bad, especially if he was required to tank multiple mobs, because the threat would be all over the place. On a single target he did fine enough, because the ability spam worked out ok, but a good tank could easily out-threat him if they were fighting for the boss.
---
Highly doubt it will be that long, they even said in a dev interview that they'll feed us the content however fast the community wants it.
---
Ye same here, Ill give it a better look tonight.
---
&gt; Because now is the prime time to talk about. 
---
It really isn't. The best time to talk about it is after we've gone through the phases and have some ***data*** on what people feel about it all - their characters, their possible desire for doing it all over or what have you. Talking about it now is pointless. It's pointless because literally every dynamic about this changes from now and until the end of phase 6.
---
The most widely accepted has been: "Was it in Vanilla?" - which constitutes 1.1-1.12 as an answer to folks looking for an answer to if people want changes or content post-Naxx.
---
&gt; and it's already in.
---
Quoting myself.
---
I was a little 13/14 year old punk. Half of my guild didn't like me but put up with me because my friend's mom was higher up in the guild and she would regularly give me talks about being an "asset not a liability". I got the call up to run MC as a substitute. Perdition's Blade dropped and I whispered the loot leader with every DKP I had after months of getting subs in for various runs, like 155. 
---
There was another rogue who would have benefitted from PB and bid too. He was way more liked in the guild and raided a lot more than me. We'll call him MainRogue
---
The loot person announced the winner "And... Perdition's Blade.. uhh well.. it goes to PMmeyourfinances.... Uhh yeah.. with a bid of 155.. wow.. MainRouge why did you only bid 150... You have like 1,000 DKP" Everyone blew up laughing hysterically a mix of MainRogue not spending enough and me taking it. But I was pumped, it was the coolest thing I had every got my hands on.
---
A good warrior with a healer will definitely touch the mage and will 1-3 shot him. 1on1 is completely different though, but theres no balance there.
---
Don't lie, it's that steamy tent chapter that's got you re-reading ;)
---
Yea looks like I was just talking out of my ass. I cant find any raid from APES with mortal strike warriors. Must have just been some dumb rumour I heard. Regardless, I stand by my point that you could be just fine in pvp spec in phase 1 and 2.
---
Let me quote myself: 
---
Leeway for abilities isn't active when either player or target is slowed more than 30%, however auto-attacks are. 
---
Charge is 11 yards because of the range calculations for the actual ability itself, it won't be any lower when it's player vs player, only higher if it's vs a tauren.
---
With leeway on minimum range it would be 11 + 2.66 = 13.66 yards... However I think leeway only applies to the maximum range for spells that have both a minimum and maximum such as charge, shoot etc... Which would mean charge would always have 11 yard range.
---
The test video is old, that's how I believed it should work up until recently... I agree it would be more reasonable to have auto-attack leeway function the same way as melee abilities, would certainly make for better gameplay as well. 
---
But it doesn't seem to be the case when examining old videos from vanilla and tbc.
---
Lol that ad wouldn't fly these day
---
Any one can PvP and do PvE as they please, no one is stopping them.
---
If you want to encourage a certain behavior you must levy some form of a tax. This means that 50g is NOT arbitrary but rather is more of a deterrent to an unwanted behavior than is 20g. WishdoctorsSong is completely correct in that your decisions require consequences in order to be impactful and create an immersive RPG. Rather than attempt to experiment with hybridizations that would allow you to compete in both PvP and PvE (albeit not as "optimally"), you would instead opt for generic builds that someone on the internet told you is "optimal".
---
It is also important to note that the Respec fee introduces a VERY important (and scarce in Classic) way to reduce inflation by removing circulating currency.
---
As for forcing people to grind an extra 30g, no one is forcing you to do anything. You are still able to participate in raids and PvP you just need to come to terms with financial consequences of your class choice rather than attempt to impress a change upon all players.
---
Warriors if you have a group.  Just about anything else if you run solo.  I played a solo warrior back in the day... lol.  If you don't find someone to follow you around, you weren't going to have a good day in BGs.  Burst is ridiculous though and MS was broken back then with the 50% reduction in heals.
---
And yes, you do need gear as a warrior.  AB and AV exalted gear plus some legionarrie pieces should do the trick though.  I wouldn't count on getting in to a raid and getting gear that way.  Warriors are a dime a dozen and the raid offset items were rare and extremely coveted.  I remember my server really only had a handful of super geared arms warriors running around.  Its really not easy to get your hands on the premium stuff.  I was a healer for my AQ40 guild and I was never allowed to bring my warrior, not even on the MC farm runs after most people already got their stuff.
---
But I remember the alliance guild leader every once in a while would show up in a BG with 1 holy paladin and resto druid and just wreck the hell out of us.  Nothing you could do to stop it.
---
Level 10 twinks have been a thing since forever. Rogues at least. 100% dodge and all that.
---
I guess some things might be different without access to level 60 enchants.
---
&gt;Save
---
Everyone will use a cast bar addon. It's just that the Blizzard one is slightly more accurate.
---
your argument here makes no sense:
---
Don't praise the good work of classic wow team
---
because
---
retail wow team is making decisions that I don't agree with...
---
go complain in r/wow if you are unhappy with the direction of retail wow...
---
Yeah I‚Äôm praying that it stays that way lol
---
But content takes more than a raid cycle to produce. For players, maybe it's not best but if your goal is to get developers on board then it needs to be done earlier instead of later.
---
it doesn't exist, there is not a single homogenized class on vanilla wow, thats a crappy wotlk+ design philosophy 
---
pvp is pure rock-paper-scissors
---
Get a couple stacks of limited invulnerability pots and you can shit on rogues and warrs as lock too :)
---
1. Elemental shamans are extremely good in BGs, most PVP shamans played 30/0/21 specs.
---
2. No just no, Ret pallies are a complete meme and pose no threat to anyone. It seems like we are going to have a lot of ret pallies, I wish I was playing Horde almost.
---
Yeah I would love to be able to 40 box AV lol
---
Adding new things to Vanilla makes it not vanilla. You think you do but you don‚Äôt.
---
Duels vs BGs vs WPvP are majorly different.
---
If you have a pocket healer, warrior will be your best bet.
---
gonna pvp to my heart's desire. 19/29/39 etc.. No rush, no plans for raiding, just going to enjoy it like I did the first time around. Hopefully find a guild of like minded individuals just to hang out with.
---
Believing doesn‚Äôt make you better at video games.
---
Jea sadly there seem allmost be no paladins in beta other then the publicity guys that would never test anything :(
---
i hope someone tests this soon.
---
Just use some magnets.
---
i like it dude i usto do mods like this every year
---
the gold square on the right pannel how did you do that? painter tape then paint blue and pull the tape?  
---
either way good work def fits with the classic theme
---
This man is why my heart has been pink for 11 years, and why I picked up engineering. I was 14 when I made a warrior in BC, and was upset when I found I couldn‚Äôt heal myself. I saw Hobbs‚Äô Scarlet Cathedral video and never went back.
---
I was invited for the last stress test but had to work and wasn‚Äôt able to download the client, where can I download it at?
---
Okay cool, this is one of the best describing answers this far. But let's say I wouldn't have too much time or luck to farm in short time. Then what class would you recommend? I think locks need quite good gear too?
---
For the first 40 levels of release me and mates I played with did all dungeons with a Shaman, Mage, Warlock, and 2 hunters.
---
Shaman would tank AND heal. We used poly and 2 traps for CC and warlocks void as an offtank (along with Hunter pets).
---
Eventually one hunter quit playing and we picked up a druid who became main tank. Everyone was pretty much a hybrid and we approached every pull differently.
---
I gotta say it was ALOT of fun.
---
Please tell me what servers there are currently that is pre AQ.
---
Oh yeah. There's none.
---
Lets go back, all the way back pre AQ.
---
Here's some BWL logs from &lt;APES&gt;. I picked apes because I want a guild that represent the best players with fair loot, so there's no chance of the skill/dedication from one class to be higher than the other. These clears are RIGHT before ZG came out, so that you see the as fully geared players as possible.

The stacking procs aren‚Äôt going to work though lol
---
&gt;‚ÄúEverything on the table‚Äù is not ‚Äúlet‚Äôs add wrath after naxx‚Äù. Not sure where OP is getting his information.
---
Both the devs and the community have discussed the idea of moving on with the expansions. There are people asking for Naxx -&gt; TBC -&gt; WoTLK as a natural progression. Don't know where you got that the devs wanted to jump straight to WoTLK
---
Lots of Mountain Dew and Dr. Pepper. My computer wasn't riced out like that and I always played on a regular computer chair. No drugs for me. Plenty of hot pockets/Pizza rolls though.
---
Since I am older and I assume a lot of us vanilla players are older now it's going to be more like a lot of coffee and sunflower seeds.
---
Good luck. Enhance is trash in 1.12.
---
Ele is good though, so you'll be fine if you're flexible.
---
This will will not be the case. More than classic wow sure but not more than mages/rouges/warriors. There is a million straw polls with different data and archetypes.
---
If people didnt want to play a 19 hour bg, then they had AB and WSG. Why cant there be options for both preferences?
---
I remember mobs repositioning themselves if you crowd them. 
---
I don't think they backpedaled though, this looks like a newer rendition if how the mobs used to turn around and run back to their hitbox range, turn back around and re-engage.
---
The issue is that some classes are OK with making choices and perhaps sacrificing a small percentage of their raid potential like all dps classes.
---
This whole trade off approach does not really pan out equivalently for priests, druids, paladins and shamans as they are hybrid classes and with the exception of the druid restricted to a support position in raids that are not on farm status.
---
Sombody else asked 'is air conditioning not a thing where you are??'
---
To which you responded that most places in EU don't have air conditioning. If the knowledge was actually common you would have just said 'He probably lives in EU' and assumed he would then realize that people who live in EU generally don't have AC.
---
You're just trying to be a snarky fuck and pretend that you're responding to an idiot that doesn't possess common knowledge. Guess what dumbfuck; you're not as smart as you think you are.
---
What? naxx isn‚Äôt out in p1 and mc isn‚Äôt nearly hard enough ‚Äúto require‚Äù engineering for anybody. The only way engineering for pve could be justified is if the guilds‚Äô sole mission is speed running. But speed running isn‚Äôt semi hardcore, it‚Äôs arguably more hardcore than method. 
---
When method finishes the tier they chill out, speed runners are just getting started.
---
This is quite a bit different from batching. That changes the way the game plays for all classes. This is something that just make melee way stronger vs certain classes. 
---
Take druid for example. They rely on getting out of range of people to survive. Using rays on people and running. This is going to make that incredibly hard to do.
---
He's not wrong though.
---
I mained druid in vanilla for a long time.  I loved playing my druid on a pserver until 60, and then I got bored really fast.  I was able to easily find groups, including raid spots but it was just lackluster.
---
Druids are really fun to level.  Min/max elitist guilds rejecting you aside:
---
1) The lack of a rez in 5 mans *sucks*.  A fun part of 5 mans is doing it when you're still in quest greens trying to gear up.  When you're in that boat and you're the druid healer, dudes die a lot, and you can't save time.  They have to run back.  That gets old really fast.
---
2) Raiding on druid is *incredibly dull.*  You'll *probably* be playing an HT spec, *probably* on MT duty, which means you target one guy and cast one rank of HT over and over and you'll end up with huge overhealing.  You will also have to decurse a lot, but good mages do that too.  You're also the worst alliance healer by a mile and innervate is generally overrated.
---
It's really easy to feel "less than."  Even when others aren't giving you shit about these issues, you'll start to feel it.  You'll get the sense that, "wow, I would really contribute a lot more to to this raid if I were playing a priest or a paladin."  That's a shitty feeling to have.  It's hard to stay high on the joy of playing a druid when you realize you're kinda just baggage.  Even if you play a memespec like balance and you're doing well (for balance) you'll have that nagging feeling like you just can't keep up with the other classes no matter what you do, because you can't.  You'll end up rolling an alt... mark my words.
---
Yea I'm having a hard time deciding, I want to own, I might have a pocket healer as my friend is a Hpal, but then again I want to run solo as best as possible too.
---
Also, they are ==&gt; DEVELOPING &lt;== complex software systems to make the modern game engine compatible with old terrain data, art assets, lighting, and game systems.
---
Dwarf.
---
For adding capabilities to your class, engineering can contribute significantly to DPS. Grenades and dynamite give you some extra CC and AoE capabilities. Gnomish battle chicken and arcanite dragonling give you and your group dps enhancing buffs. There's really no reason to go anything but engineering as a primary profession unless your goal is to make gold or make gear/potions for your guild to progress in raids.
---
They removed loads of patrols, mine fields, the shredder  quest, a boss, a set of caverns...
---
All so people could grind their precious honor faster to get loot.
---
I'm invited to the stress test (only) and yes it shows on my Accounts list under Games and Subscriptions.
---
Title should read ‚Äú20% chance this is the last thing you see before you die‚Äù
---
Exactly.  They should keep at least one pristine classic server, but after a year or two do something like Path of Exile seasons where they change things up and add new content.  I'd rather have that than TBC
---
I know right. Let's make respec cost 10000g.
---
Let's make mounts cost 100000g.
---
If you disagree you're just too lazy to invest the time like a pleb
---
go back to retail pls
---
FilePlanet! That's how I got into beta way back then. I had a paid fileplanet subscription lol. God damn.
---
Looks beauty, would love to see how this was done
---
Savory Deviate Delight is your friend.
---
That I've learned, but I'm just looking for that slight edge, like in wotlk humans had that slight edge with trinket racial and could go double dps trinkets for example.
---
Good plan!
---
Probably much slower, quest XP is pretty big in vanilla. And dungeons are much slower than retail.
---
Still, I'll take camping points at some dungeons as I level. I want to farm materials and level professions as well. I don't mind hitting 60 a bit slower and raiding with people who had a similar goal.
---
Getting to 60 is not the entry point for raiding. The entry point is 60 and professions/gear decked out for raiding. If you hit 60 and you don't have anything done, you will have to go back to the lower level zones anyway.
---
&gt;Dawn of War
---
I can see you are a man of culture as well
---
Engineering wasn‚Äôt required 15 years ago to clear naxx. It isn‚Äôt needed on pservers, it isn‚Äôt needed on classic. It‚Äôs purely a tool to go faster. The content isn‚Äôt tuned around 40 thorium bombs going off every two minutes to get you enough dps to beat the enrage.
---
Yeah, I think you're right. Guess I'll start today :)
---
When you send Goku your energy from azeroth
---
Agreed ,even in bfa the durid, shaman, warrior, hunter, and DK specs all feel distinct to me. I can't say for the other classes because I don't play them much. 
---
I swear that r/wow contains allot of ignorant and or malicious posters
---
I still know more than you.
---
Again, so is spell batching.
---
About druids escaping: They managed to do it during vanilla, they'll still manage to do it. It's working the same way it used to be.
---
Jesus. The length in which they are seeing target bars is stupidly far!
---
‚ÄúWe go from naxx to wotlk‚Äù is literally what you said. That‚Äôs where I got ‚Äúdeva wanted to jump straight to wotlk‚Äù. 
---
Don‚Äôt make your post so long if you‚Äôre gonna forget what you even said.
---
Considering cat runs faster anyway, I don‚Äôt see any reason why you‚Äôd be in cow form for anything
---
You said "that's how it is on private servers", not me.
---
For somebody excited about the game you seem to be very filled with hate. Good luck in your life man.
---
Talking about where his character was actually fleshed out after Vanilla. It wasn't in a novel, it was in comics leading up to WotLK. The first one came out in 2007.
---
Layering.
---
While we're at it: you should probably not use your Voidwalker to level up until you reach your mid-30s, where its threat generation is more relevant since you get the right talents.   
---
  And even then, it's probably better to use your Imp for the damage and Stam buff!
---
I mean there‚Äôs still gonna be smaller limit on locks because they‚Äôre a debuff heavy class and there are plenty of important debuffs so you can‚Äôt just be wasting all 16 slots on lock stuff.
---
if they supported content creators i could live with this interface 
---
only just though lol
---
remember the period where yt thots would make replies to pretty much any video on youtube and it would get pinned directly under the video rofl
---
takes me back
---
Love this format.
---
You really can't make a `/dismount /cast spell` macro for the ability?
---
I wouldn't use Earthen Ring US as an example of server communities dying over time. ER maintained a strong sense of server community all the way until *WoD* when the community imploded, starting from the RP community, because everyone got sick of one another.
---
I only joined ER in Cataclysm, but people still kept a strong record of everything that happened on the server all the way since the beginning. It really was an exceptional server.
---
As it should be, for the alliance!
---
&gt;be hunter
---
&gt;one shot cloth classes from a further range than any of their spells
---
Wow, truly skilled Pepega Clap
---
If only there was a Bell toy...
---
You're talking about Horizontal progression vs diagonal progression. 
---
Its not an easy problem to solve, its not as simple as saying "well just don't make gear better every raid."
---
The root of the problem is, if every subsequent raid or new challenge that comes out is as easy as its previous predecessor than what is the point in progression? Guildwars2 has this problem, imo its the biggest reason why many people don't play it to this day. 
---
Imagine a world where you leveled up to 60 Conquered Naxx, then AQ then after that a new raid came out and the gear drops didn't improve and the difficulty didn't increase. Why would you do the raid? To complete it? Achievments? Story? Probably but then there wouldn't be any reason to return to that raid after you've done it once. So whats the draw to playing the game if not the end game? Leveling? Socializing? PvP?
---
These are HUGE questions devs have to answer when making and designing MMO's.
---
In ESO they handle it pretty nicely, you've got a level cap of 50, but then a seperate level cap once you reach 50. At CP 160 gear stops improving, its the best gear you'll ever get in the history of the game, but the incentive to keep playing is because your level cap is at 810.650 levels inbetween the gear cap and the true level cap.
---
Each level earned after level 50 essentially rewards you with a passive point you can allocate to make your character stronger, the question they need to answer now is how do they raise the level cap without making the game problematic in the long run?
---
In theory the best way to handle it in WoW would be to never increase the level cap, but increase the strength of gear rewarded from the next tier of raid, not dungeons.
---
This way you could experience all of TBC in your elite vanilla gear and then start upgrading your gear once you start raiding in TBC, so on and so forth for every expansion afterwards.
---
Those aren't Horde colors.
---
Any feral spec will naturally grab some of the cat talents anyway (predatory strikes, sharpened claws, heart of the wild) so even if you are full restobear 0/30/21 your cat DPS will be fine for solo grinding and questing. If you want to sacrifice some bear talents for the 1-60 grind, I wouldn‚Äôt bother with the bonus armor talent while leveling. That frees up 5 points for cat move speed, CP generation, and/or flat claw damage increase. You won‚Äôt notice the loss of survivability until you are hitting the 55+ content and by then you should be considering gearing and respecing for whatever you will main at 60
---
Hunter imo. A great hunter &gt; everything. Warriors with a healer are awesome no doubt. Frost mages are also awesome for sure. I would rather fight either one of those over a top tier hunter.
---
During my PS days I was pissed that my guild made me switch from BM to MM to raid MC. Then  evicted me when I made one mistake
---
Sure he might not be, but him getting glad has him better at PVP than most people who touch retail, classic or most in this sub. Downvotes might be incoming but Vanilla WoW PVP wasn't as skill based as current MMR systems.
---
You will not have raids every day when pushing for rank 14. it is very unlikely you would raid more than one day per week.
---
Not sure what ur talking about.
---
Their raid dps starts falling back after bwl compared to other pure dps classes. That‚Äôs about it.
---
Their burst is absolutely insane and they can be massive beasts in each aspect of pvp but you rly need to know what you are doing the skill cap is pretty much the highest in the game.
---
Part of raiding is wiping. If you're farming, that's different. If you're running through content and never wiping you're not trying to do hard content. You're farming.
---
auto loot is already in classic... it also was in vanilla as well by holding shift but in classic its available without holding shift too.
---
This.  This is one of the ways players on private servers can/have kept things fresh. A new server launches, they migrate to the new server as a fresh start and go through the content in staggered progression all over again.
---
oh no it's already happening and the game isn't even out yet. Gl blizzard
---
He never said it did.
---
Accurate. :)
---
Read again.
---
Only good thing about hunter is viper sting lul.
---
For the Alliance!
---
I hear you, but you're just looking at this 1 game. Activision Blizzard is or already has "remastered" all of it's major titles. Starcraft, Warcraft 3, Vanilla WoW and I bet Diablo 2 as well. Do you think this is the product of people posting on forums or a business strategy?
---
I added a TL;DR for people with a shorter attention span who can't read in context.
---
Are you serious? Regardless if I am among or could be among the "95%" you could give your opinion on the matter without telling me what I am or not.
---
I'd completely disagree here, hybrids seem to have some of the best overlaps between specs and content. Holy paladins are amazingly strong in pvp. Druids have multiple specs that are great in both, HotW lets you pretty much play full feral outside of raids, Swiftmend is an awesome flag runner as well as pure healer, disc priests are strong pvpers that guilds will want to have a few along for for the PI buff.
---
Meanwhile over in dps-land, prot warriors are trash anywhere but in a raid, combat rogues have sacrifieced nearly all of their pvp tricks, all mages except the winters chill bitch should be arcane/frost which is a terrible world spec. Warlocks are lucky in that they have SM/ruin which is strong in most realms but still falls into the master-of-none category. Not everything is candy and roses over in dps land as far as spec utility goes.
---
And that's a good thing, it brings us back to the whole point of the thread. There should be tradeoffs and consequences in your spec choice, and vanilla succeeds in that.
---
alliance gonna have ret paladin memes and horde is gonna have enh shaman memes, I love it
---
Spell batching effects all classes. They all have the ability to use CC, consumable version or not. This looks like something that does nothing positive for a lot of classes. 
---
It function more as a bug than anything, far beyond what spell batching replicates.
---
who would have thought in the end the wow killer would be wow
---
Yes!  I'm so jealous of the people in beta.
---
Resto, just would be nice to be able to go feral for raid prep and making some money in downtime.
---
Shit I remember The Eleventh Hour. Guys from that guild helped my guild clear MC the first time. I think their horde-side guild was The Seventh Guest... Good shit
---
I actually used a stencil and painted the gold on top of the blue paint.  I would recommend using vinyl stickers instead of painting because moving and taping down stencils takes forever.
---
The only thing racial weapon skills affect is your choice in gear. You'll hit a bit harder and more frequently with a sword or a mace in your main-hand, and might be able to ignore a piece of 1% hit gear and prioritize crit or a bit more mitigation.  With night elf and the extra 1% dodge, you can ignore a bit of mitigation and focus more on hit. 
---
Ultimately though, it doesn't matter that much. Pick the aesthetic/racial skills that you want and git gud at your class. What's between the keyboard and the chair matters more than the min/max meta.
---
So? Blizzard is on completely uncharted waters here. Why would they ever produce anything at all without a single shred of evidence that people actually want it?
---
That kind of evidence isn't something you can poll or debate your way to. The only kind of evidence that shareholders understand is sub count.
---
As an example, if Classic ends up bombing (we don't know yet), how could you justify to shareholders to begin creating new content now? That's right, you can't. Just stop. It's embarrasing that you pretend to have so little understand of the basics of life. You're smarter than this.
---
Damn. My friends and I are rolling ally since we played horde for so long during the private servers. I'm going to miss that
---
Dude, a level 40 server would be fucking amazing!
---
You disagree, so fuck off? Now that's some serious narcissism.
---
My guild is still progressing BoD (currently on Mekka), and I kinda had fun until the moment I start seeing people play Classic on Twitch. Now I just want out...
---
Gotta get that weapon skill up fast!
---
That's for Blizz to decide, I'm not arguing what should or shouldn't be. I'm one of those people who will stick to WSG and AB regardless of how AV is implemented. I'm just commenting on how a portion of this community is extremely arrogant and dismissive about other people who have genuine preferences and complaints about classic.
---
Blizzard has made plenty of mistakes with WoW over the years that speak for themselves. We don't need to pretend that everything that was changed from Vanilla made the game worse, or was a result of a small number of people QQ'ing. There were plenty of common sense changes just from Vanilla to TBC that made the game better.
---
I agree, AV was cool but making it more around an hour for a decent run verse an entire day was a great move. Maybe when I was 18 I could do that but there is no way I could do a 19 hour AV today.
---
Just you wait when itemization kicks in. You will not ever kill a healer again besides priests. Also t3 paladin. You will literally do no damage to him.
---
I think that the people that tried the alpha should've given insta access to the beta.
---
Firefox is still good. I switched to it from Chrome recently due to memory problems in Chrome (Despite having 16GB of RAM).
---
Dwarf is by far the best, but if you can't get behind a dwarf you can go human just fine. Perception still has its uses in WSG especially in scouting FCs
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted. The old raid content is absolutely easier than the modern progression content. We just weren't as good at the game back then and raids were 40-man instead of 25-man.
---
Go on pretending that vanilla raids need a perfect class composition, in a version of wow with class balance changes and buffed itemization, modern internet connections and pc performance, and ungodly amounts of resources.
---
It's precisely because the content is fixed that you can get by with nonideal compositions.
---
It's a shit goldsink that depresses player activity - an obviously undesirable outcome.
---
It also doesn't affect each player equally, another poor design for a goldsink.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not really true at all but ok.
---
Ah okay.
---
Exactly, hence the comparison to flatearthers. I am not trying to disparage actually good investigations based on facts, but This anecdotal stuff is just muddying up the whole picture. If people want the game to be Harder, why do they just not advocate for that?
---
There will be addons yes.
---
As for thottbot, I think it's going to have to be classic section of wowhead instead.
---
If you don‚Äôt want to speed run it literally doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
The only profession you NEED for raiding is first aid. 
---
Herb/alch/enchanting saves you money.
---
Tailoring/LW/Bs all have gear others can make for you (except tailoring, the class specific robes are bop, but don‚Äôt require tailoring, so make them then drop) 
---
Mining and skinning give you no benefits in raiding
---
Engineering has ooc items like repair bots as well as grenades you can use in combat to boost dps‚Äîbut literally 0 content in classic requires engineering grenades to beat enrages. 
---
As a caster, if I were ultra hardcore, I‚Äôd level tailoring and mining, make my robe, drop tailoring for engineering, level that up, drop mining for herbalism. I‚Äôll probably still do that for PvP, it will be a cold day in hell before I throw grenades at a pve boss in classic. 
---
People talk about how the grenades are ‚Äúrequired‚Äù yet when a hunter comes in saying you can get 80-160 more dps by cycling in and out of melee he gets blown out of this subreddit for being ‚Äútoo tedious‚Äù....
---
Like just whatever. Being able to kilm shit
---
The easiest and most likely solution is that Blizzard does a Wow Armory for classic, which I think we all expect.  Even if there's no API access, you can easily scrape the page the same way that we did in 2004.   If that displays events like "Bob killed Ragnaros", well then that's that.  If it doesn't display those, you could at least surmise some amount of data about boss kills from things like what boss drops the gear they're wearing, faction reputations, etc.  
---
And if for some reason they don't do an armory, the same information could just be gathered locally by an addon, with some history tracking, based on 'inspect'.  "Bob is currently wearing a piece from Chromaggus and I've previously seen him wearing the legs from Rag.  I was also in a group with him that killed Lucifron".  None of this is perfect knowledge, but death by a thousand cuts means an active player would eventually have a decent idea of who's killed what.  
---
I'm not a fan of classic [raider.io](https://raider.io) either, but it's definitely not impossible.
---
I‚Äôm getting my girl a PC so she can heal me while I level. Sometimes you find that lucky girl that will be your priest bitch. :)
---
It's not that bad if you know what you're doing. As long as you stay away from orange quests, and find mobs 2-3 levels lower than you when it's time to grind you can have a pretty smooth leveling experience as a warrior.
---
It got a bad rep in vanilla because most people didn't understand how glancing blows worked, and they assumed warriors should be able to solo the same stuff as hunters.
---
It was literally the only reason why i never used a gun with my hunter. One shot was ok but having that sound all the time, no!
---
Lol it's not about them, it's about who their boss is, which is J Allen Brack and Kotick who obviously do not understand classic.  JAB is on record for saying people don't want classic.
---
He's only backpedaling now because of how bad BFA is.  I'm sure deep down he still means what he means.
---
Because there will be no one there to play it with them. In essence, they wont be playing the same content because it will be so empty and dungeons, raids, and even elite mobs will be basically impossible to kill without finding a high level to carry you (not really "playing" anyway). Less of an issue in the beginning but a massive one after a couple of years or enough content has been added. I think there are better ways to do it than they did but its not as simple as it sounds.
---
Not sure what I said warranted such a response.
---
Druids can easily compete as one of the top healers in raids but the vast majority of people think they are bad because you only bring 1-2 to 40mans.
---
You only bring 1-2 to raids because hots do not stack and you need a certain amount of Priests/Paladins/Shaman to cover buffs and dispels. Druids also underperform when a guild brings too many healers to a raid. Too many healers means a lot of heal sniping, which Druids cant compete against very well.
---
Luckily for me, when i first started playing, my friends had all rerolled on a fresh server, so I was leveling with some experienced players that coached me long the way.
---
In most cases, while tanking 5-mans, I remember Demo shouting, tab target sundering, and swapping into Battle stance to Thunderclap, then back to Def stance.   Looking back on it, I'm honest surprised how quickly I picked it up, considering I was still a keyboard turning, clicking noob.  I probably could have been a decent tank if I hadn't swapped to my warlock later.
---
They don't need it
---
But why would I as a DPS warrior buff or choose an optimum spec when I do more damage than a ret paladin or boomkin who is full buffed and perfect spec?
---
Empty raid slots are viable, no one denies that. Which means all specs are viable. And in a semi hardcore guild when vanilla was live. Ret paladin was legit, they started off the expansion being able to one shot bosses with reckoning lol and had kings. 
---
But I'd rather have an empty raid slot than have a paladin who convicnes teh rest of my guild they don't need to buff because he does no damage on 1.12
---
Welcome to raiding,  lol
---
People will move to the lowest common denominator that gives them loot.
---
And having shit specs means you can't pressure people in proper specs to buff.
---
Esfand adds hours to his guilds play time just from his drinking, lol, and he's playing ret near optimal beyond going and farming gnomer for the crowd pummeler
---
You have no idea waht you're talking about. Your'e gonna spend hours upon hours in those instances, no1 got time for you to fuck around
---
Can't upvote this enough.
---
The case is closed on which specs are "raid viable" and which are "not."  I use "not" in quotations here because I believe that classic is going to end up being so easy that any spec will be invited and in fact raiding with as many meme specs as possible will be a fun challenge for advanced players.
---
Guild adverts will fall under "no memespecs" vs. "memespecs welcome."  Players will pick memespecs allowed if they want to play an "overlooked" spec.  Otherwise, they'll stick to the cookie cutter raid comps and face roll everything.
---
It is. But I think it means something else now. :)
---
I want to finally find a guild/group/community again i enjoy playing with.
---
From vanilla up until wotlk ive never had a problem with finding one, but ever since Cata it went downhill, dunno why... maybe because of lfr.
---
Most of my time spent playing vanilla paladin was pre 1.9 and I'm still not over the shift in meta.
---
It's something like waking up from a long coma 30 years from now and learning that Druids are kings of PVE now
---
For a rogue not only do you get to boost your dps by a little bit, you also have a chance at a res via jumper cables. 
---
10/10 would go engi on Rogue.
---
There were massive changes in every patch of Vanilla. A class rework almost every patch, etc.
---
You sound like a private server baby who thinks 1.12 is the only Vanilla experience.
---
Just join a guild that raids bi-weekly so you don‚Äôt have to respec as often.
---
It is not, though. Full shadow priests are super gimped in raids. You lose out the ability to realistically slow heal so you become a one button priest that thinks he is good but in reality really isn‚Äòt.
---
Sure, you can clear like that. But if every healer (and non-healer) used that approach then you would start to struggle even with simple bosses like Golemagg. Let alone primitive Domo approaches or Rag.
---
100% and even higher ret numbers because of Esfand (not knocking him, he's just spreading their popularity).
---
Warrior is punished so much harder in Vanilla/Classic than retail. Will be fun
---
... and you are playing a 1.12 based patch. Your point is ? :D Im not theory crafting here, people are doing this as we speak.
---
I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôd be stunned then dead within seconds of me breaking stealth.  The first two hits could crit for over 3k damage if i remember correctly.
---
Hunter is just trash in pvp. No real instant damage (arcane shot lol). Has to stand still for auto shoot. 30 second trap cd (and every tryhard will wear skull of impending doom anyway).
---
You like AV not my way? Play something else.
---
Only way I see you getting to be an enhancement shaman in raids is if it is your alt and the raids have been on farm for months. Even then you'd most likely be put to be a healer in healer gear (even if your spec is 0/31/20). Any good raid leader or role leader would make you do that.
---
I learned today that the World Health Organization has officially categorized "Gaming Disorder" as an ICD-11 disease.

I'm no lawyer, but based on my understanding of social disability eligibility, you could conceivably claim this as a reason to quit working and collect disability checks, assuming you can get it formally diagnosed.
---
Title: no. There is a Wowhead theme though.
---
Mods: yes, Addon devs need to make them work though.
---
Thottbot quest: if you don't know them, sure. You could read the quests or ask people in game too.
---
Badly.
---
Nobody has ever said Druids aren't good in PVP.
---
Well I know where you are coming from. I really like the horde bike but the sound of it is so annoying that I can't use it for long.
---
Ricksantotem
---
Hunters seem to be quite nice in PvP as well, but I thought they could only really compare to other classes with early gear?
---
Step 1: Get to 60
---
Step 2: Farm mats, gear, and other players
---
People will know nowadays. You can‚Äôt hide that you‚Äôre cheap/casual in 2019.
---
Sure, you're just in their forums trolling about how much they're not developing. If retail was any fun, you'd be playing it right now instead of wasting time here.
---
So every tryhard is going to be rocking skull of impending doom and using it before your every trap?
---
Cause you can‚Äôt use it (or couldn‚Äôt in vanilla) while trapped.
---
I can tell you haven‚Äôt played with or against many good (not even great) hunters by the fact you call them trash.
---
You can check 
---
classic.wowhead or classicdb.ch for the info. I'm currently having an easier time finding stuff at classicdb but I know that wowhead is working on their stuff.
---
What's that I hear? Traditional Alliance crying?
---
Yeah, but level 30 is a different world than 60.  There were 19, 29, 39, and 49, twink tier lists back then, that showed in the different level brackets, which classes were the strongest.  Warlocks, hunters and rogues were very strong early on, but then in the 39 and 49 brackets warriors, shamans, and shadow priests started taking over due to scaling and their gear options.
---
Bgs are the only way to get high ranks. It gives so much more cp than world pvp.
---
This! I have been thinking about, how to make end game content more attractive for players so it wont get to boring raidlogging and i came up with an idea of random events happening throughout the world. Some may be huge, requiring preparation and time and some may ne spontaneous. This would keep the world alive. Im mindblowed, noone ever came up with this idea at blizzard
---
You guys all need to look up a Venn diagram on google. So does most of this sub though tbf.
---
I learned to tank from my buddy who went hard into WoW a little earlier than I did, so I never really struggled. You just need to know a few principles to get started.
---
* Use a shield.
---
* Sunder armor is your main tool for generating and maintaining threat. Not Taunt. Not Thunder Clap. SUNDER.
---
* Forget about Charge until you know what you're doing. Pull with a ranged weapon, and use Bloodrage to generate rage.
---
* Communicate with your party. In multi-mob pulls, designate primary and secondary targets (using icons, traditionally Skull and Red X) so everyone's on the same page.
---
Just knowing and doing those will put you ahead of the curve. The rest you can learn by doing.
---
Hate to break it to you, but classic won't be difficult in the slightest. 
---
*16 debuff slots (instead of 8)
---
*Buffed 1.12 class talents
---
*Buffed Itemization/Gear
---
*Player skill/knowledge of the game is drastically improved.
---
I died a lot in windshear crag.
---
In PvP no. In pve yes.
---
PvE hunters fall off after t2 or so. In PvP they remain a strong contender. Assuming they are played well.
---
Not exactly "free hk" but they are much stronger late game (late bwl-AQ40). Problem with warlocks early on is that they have so little health, a warlock in full MC gear has 1k more hp than a warlock in full preraid gear. The stat increase they get as raid content goes on is so massive. As for hunters, they only scale bad in PvE, they scale just fine in PvP. A hunter in BWL-Naxx gear will have close to 6k hp and 30% crit chance and thats a tough matchup for anyone.
---
Leeway also is a factor for all classes. Some from an attacking perspective, some from a kiting/running away perspective, some from both.
---
It still affects everyone.
---
2005 on ventrilo, musing about our classes and why we liked them, 
---
I pipe up with ‚ÄúI like revenge, it‚Äôs like a second taunt‚Äù (to be fair, it is a lot of threat)
---
I got laughed at for days. ‚ÄúLoveshisbuds doesn‚Äôt even know what revenge does!!!‚Äù 
---
I was 15 and so embarrassed I misspoke that I pretty much stopped tanking, stopped playing that character and within 3 weeks was leveling a priest. I‚Äôve mained a priest since, and I have learned to tank. Tanking pve in classic and arms-in up PvP is the god tier experience.
---
I got into the first stress test, but didn‚Äôt get any emails, the option just appeared in the battle.net client.
---
He said he believes in his ability to achieve 95%, not "I believe im in the 95%, therefore i am"  Surely you dont believe world of warcraft requires some special talent that is not achievable through a little hard work and perseverance?  The first step is to believe you can do it.
---
He isn't saying he'll be good *because* he believes it, he's just saying he believes he can be good.
---
for some reason i thought it was once the flag carrier went past the half way point of the map.
---
next time try sprey adhesive 
---
wear a mask because its terrible for lungs
---
it can basically make whatever the stencil is tacky to prevent the color bleed on the edges
---
dong a patern with tape then putting the blue over the tape would have taken ages but you end up with a nice end result.
---
either way really like it and that you went to the effort to have a different interior colour
---
It all depends on your spec.  Early on, Sm/Ruin will struggle due to the lack of spell hit and crit.  Soul link will be super easy mode, as you basically get a free permanent 30% damage reduction as long as your pet is alive.  So just dot-rot them down.
---
Yea locks seem quite interesting to me as well, they have quite a lot of different skills.
---
Locks are fine without raiding gear.  PvP stuff should be fine.  Soul Link with a Fel Hunter made you less squisher than other casters.  Plus, you can drain and have your health stones.  
---
So probably lock, rogue, or hunter.  Mage is fine too.
---
Bro I have been bored with other games since the end of TBC. Wow ruined gaming for me. After classic and TBC. Nothing was ever good enough. Nothing else was ever worth playing. With only three notable exceptions for me. Civ 5, Fallout 3, and Fallout New Vegas. May Fallout 4 rot in hell. I cast aspersions on it's name.
---
Edit: Elder Scrolls is a poor mans Fallout. Generic ass fantasy. Bland and boring. Snooze button plx.
---
When you have Bonereaver's Edge
---
They just use it when they engage you.
---
You mean like the out of combat ressers?
---
Guildbank and battlepets ( battlepets only for fun and cosmetic )
---
It is arbitrary. Under your reasoning, making the respec cost 500g, or 1000g would improve the game, because it would make your spec choice matter even more.
---
Of course this is silly, because it would soon show that some classes suffer far more than others, and not in any meaningful gameplay reason, but an arbitrary gold sink selectively applied. 
---
And this is the fundamental problem with the excessive respec tax - it's not balanced between classes.
---
Which makes the mechanic fundamentally flawed unless the cost is reasonable. It doesn't make sense that some classes can pay 0 tax and pvp/pve at 99% viability when some *must* pay 50g any time they want to play the other.
---
I used to DPS with a 1h and shield from level 1 to about 30. This was because a good 2h in D2 was about twice the DPS as a good 1h, while in WoW, the difference is usually about 25-35%, so from my perspective all 2hs that I came across sucked and werent worth using over a shield. I would go to dungeons as the tank, but didnt know what it meant, so I would just DPS stuff and no one would really question me because I was using a shield at least, they thought I was just bad.
---
At level 40, I respecd to get MS and since I was setting up for this to be my spec for a long time, I was carefully looking through every single warrior ability to see which talents were worth it. When I looked at Heroic Strike, it said it generated "increased threat". I asked my friend wtf threat was, which he explained makes mobs more likely to attack me. I wondered why anyone would want to get attacked MORE, it made no sense. He just  said "for tanking". I thought for a few seconds and suddenly it all clicked together, the shield, the better armor for warriors, I finally understood what people meant by tanking all this time. From then on, my runs went 100x better and almost all my groups were successful.
---
Prot warriors are kind of useless *even in raids*. I don‚Äòt know. There is so much wrong with your post I don‚Äòt even know where to begin. For one thing the mage thing assumes there is no AQ or Naxx.
---
It sounds like you are a druid main and projecting to other classes. Because indeed, a druid‚Äòs tri spec is quite viable. But you could not be more wrong for Shamans and Priests. In fact for priests you are making my point without realizing.
---
&gt;s this is common sense, but let's not forget tha
---
&gt; ~~/S~~ 
---
ftfy
---
\*cries in the corner\*
---
I would suggest also thinking about equipment. If you play the same class, you need the same EQ twice.
---
It might be better to have classes with different EQ, e.g. one with cloth and one with leather, then you will be a lot happier about drops.
---
Furthermore, it is important what you want to achieve: Get 60 fast? Get rich? Have fun exploring and questing? Raids? PvP? Depending on that, there are different combos that are better or less good.
---
he's just a pserver kid

Better bang for you buck. Still not ideal.

FFXIV does a good job of keeping old content relevant and populated, and making sure that most new players actually experience it on their way to the level cap.
---
I'm not sure how extendable this is to WoW - there are only 2 (soon to be 3) expansions out, the core focus is a single narrative questline centered on your own character, and it relies on an automated party-making system to get you through older content. But the coming New Game+ system, the level-synching mechanic for older content, and the doling out of relevant end-game rewards for running older content would all go a long way toward making older content relevant.
---
What if running stat-synched Molten Core with for the first time gave you relevant end-game currency? What if you got end-game currency for playing through any vanilla, TBC, and WOTLK content for the first time with your recently boosted BFA character?
---
And hardcore raiders don't have to worry about their own efforts being diminished, because the currency-bought equipment can be restricted to one tier below the current best.
---
That's interesting. I played with a hunter and warlock in vanilla that had one button macros for raiding, but thought tanks would need to be paying closer attention.
---
Preach ripped on vanilla, but he just as often sang its praises. This is the dude known for his Legacy videos. For what he enjoys most out of the game, raiding, tbh the old version was worse in a lot of ways, but the problem is that the game now is JUST about raiding for him. Whereas in the past, it was about so much more, and raiding was the cherry ontop, not the whole meal.
---
Well the vanilla world record right now is 4 days and 20 hours. With your math you‚Äôre suggesting a time of 4 days 14 hours. Unless you‚Äôre playing a tier 1 leveling class and have more extensive knowledge than the literal world record holder(s) I wouldn‚Äôt plan on that time.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to de-motivate you but realistic expectations will also help prevent burnout. Just take it at your own pace and enjoy the game. You only get to level 1-60 for the first time on classic once. Don‚Äôt ruin it for yourself.
---
Your team should be protecting you. If you stay 30yd away you shouldnt be getting ganked by 5 ppl.
---
So casual guilds have to be optimal?
---
people are more sure about what is optimal in this game?
---
I would argue that most people/guilds except the very hardcore are consistently saying that they aren't too concerned about what is optimal and will take a handful of not ideal specs if that's what people want to play.
---
Druids are a super fun class.
---
played a tauren druid in classic myself, getting raid armor helps alot :)
---
Also tons of noggenfogger + deviate delight
---
In the end playing your fav class with friends is all that matters imo
---
Start her with a single player rpg first. Diablo 3 maybe. Just some basic leveling to learn equipping gear, pressing spells to damage things... etc. Basic RPG stuff.
---
Wow was my first mmo experience and I had played tons of other blizz games and RPGs and I was still rather overwhelmed starting vanilla. I could not imagine wow classic first game ever. Seems like a setup for failure. Unless maybe she's played a lot of console games with rpg, fighting... etc.
---
/shrug, obviously depends on the person and their desire to struggle and learn.
---
There was addon for this in Vanilla and there is an addon for this in classic.
---
Yes, that's what I think too. The TBC old world changes were mostly changing elite quests to normal, increasing quest XP rewards and reducing the amount of XP required to level up.
---
My intent is to go HoTW spec for as long as possible, and it'd be really cool to get of to a good start when spamming dungeons as fresh 60 with the bis tanking weapon. If it's around 100g or so on launch it just might be worth it seems.
---
One of the best meme formats ever.
---
One of the coolest things I remember was when we got Felgaurd. All of a sudden you have a charge ability.... so fun. Tell your pet to stay put walk a bit, let rogue or anyone stun attack you and boom it charges in and you get to kicking some ass. 
---
Lock mounts... fantastic stuff.
---
Believing you can be good doesn‚Äôt mean you can be.
---
This sounds pretty fun. TY!
---
Something like, yeah. Edited.
---
Let‚Äôs get dr Phil in here
---
Classic WoW has essentially the same spec requirements as Retail.
---
It sound like a band aid fix for people with bad ping. Not an intentional dynamic for PvP. Oh well, guess it ls gonna make its way to live.
---
vellums are definitely something i will miss significantly.
---
It'll be fine. I used to play wow (during MOP and then Legion) on a laptop worse than that and never had any issues. In my case, I didn't even own a desktop at the time, I just hooked my laptop up to a monitor/keyboard/mouse and it worked well.
---
And I‚Äôll say it again. Believing doesn‚Äôt mean you can.
---
Longarms was the retired dude whose wife died that played a hunter all day every day and had Grand Marshall for months on end. I wonder if he's still alive.
---
Absolutely false lol
---
There goes his career
---
Soda did a tier list which is fairly accurate placing the likes of Locks, S. Priests, Sub Rogues and Frost Mages at the top, in that order. However his list was 1on1 duel based. Which placed Arms Warriors near the bottom, and H. Paladins were not a factor, which is accurate. But in a group setting, they are both top tier.
---
What you should consider is that the only competitive PvP aspect are premades, essentially WSG and AB. In that setting, range tends to be preferred due to AB especially having very few areas where you can pillar hump. However Arms is still mandatory due to MS. A few Rogues can sneak in, but again range is preferred. 
---
You are correct in that Arms is dogshit if you just randomly pug and hope that some healer will heal you. I played a Warrior, and back then that happened maybe once every 8th-10th game. In that random pug like setting, Hunters tend to be the best PvP class due to the general chaotic nature of pugs, and again the open nature of WSG and AB.
---
All 3 of the classes you considered are decent. Warriors just come with a alot of caveats. Id wager most Warriors at lvl 60 will eat dirt in most BGs due to simple lack of healers.
---
Try dauntless, i started playing it recently and its stopping the wow itch. And its free now
---
Prior to the human change, I would argue that gnomes are the best race for Rogues if your intentions are to PvP as alliance. While stoneform is a great racial against a few use cases, rogues generally lack mobility. Doing everything possible to eliminate that weakness is key. The biggest "pro" for stoneform is that you get an advantage in the Rogue mirror. I would argue that the biggest advantage in the rogue mirror is landing the sap. While Stoneform can definitely turn the tables in the matchup, if you and the opponent are at near equal skill level, the match will usually be determined by the person who finds the other player first.
---
My opinion is that Stoneform is primairly good against Warriors and Rogues. Yes, it can have usages against other classes/spells (Devouring Plague, Armor Buff is good) but generally the most bang for your buck is in those two matchups. 
---
On the other hand Escape Artist hits: Frost Nova (Mage), Crippling Poison (Rogue), Concussion Shot (Hunter), Hamstring (Warrior), Frost Shock (Shaman), Entangling Roots (Drood). Pretty much the only classes you don't get any usage against are Paladins and Priests. And boy howdy do I got some news for you... Unless you're choosing to duel a paladin you won't have to fight one!
---
Again, this is all opinion, but I don't think the choice is even close. When the opener is the deciding factor in most rogue duels, you're better off going human to try and game the system that way. You still do get a ton of play out of Stoneform against Rogues, but best case scenario, you get outplay opportunity. Against warriors, you can just bleedkite assuming you don't mess up your opener. So I feel like Stoneform is a "win more" racial while Escape Artist actually closes the gap on some matchups that will give you issues.
---
Druids. Balance as sustained dps is garbage. But feral isn‚Äôt bad, dps or honestly tanking till raids. They are great healers that just require a bit of foresight. This just in: you don‚Äôt need a res if you never let your group members die. 
---
Hunters. In Vanilla they were massively popular, they probably will be on classic too. But if you read this forum, it comes across as though hunters are off in a corner eating paint chips when everyone else is dps ing. Hunters are only detrimental in a speed running scenario where you want 16 warriors. Only sped runners should be looking at them as inferior, they are plenty viable and will soak up loot that would otherwise be sharded. Unfortunately tho the propoganda is such that many more speed running guilds will cast hunters aside.
---
Yeah! I read somewhere in this subreddit about running around like a noob was pretty cool because you were running so slow and got to experience the big world as a traveler. I remember exploring some cool places or trying to run around high level mobs just to get to somewhere, it could be pretty frustrating, but I think we all liked it still somehow :D
---
It's a thing.
---
apparently "all the time"/2 = "rarely"
---
TIL
---
Come on buddy, no need to drop as low as "the basics of life" for an internet argument and try to at least understand what I'm actually trying to present. 
---
The only evidence shareholders understand is sub count. Okay, that's fair. The game launched and it's doing great. The shareholders want to know how you can maintain this sub growth after the 6 phases you already developed the content for. What I'm saying is that point will come earlier then your vision for it and it's best for us to be prepared. It's a win / win situation for us and Blizzard should they ever need to point to a strong community demand for future content. 
---
Should the game fail, then there's no loss on Blizzard's side. My post clearly states that this should be a community effort to try to come up with ideas early so that when Blizzard is ready to move on, they have some community feedback to fall back on. Should the game fail, then there's no financial loss on them. We would just have lost a bit of time talking about a project we loved.
---
As for the shareholder argument, there's always more nuance then what you are presenting. In fact, the argument can be made that, for an investor, the **only** successful and proven model that exists to revitalize an old MMORPG is the OSRS model. Should your model for "the basics of life" apply, why wouldn't investors use an industry success as his or her preferred method?
---
One of the basics of life is to sit down, listen to somebody else, and engage in discours. I don't think I hurt anyone with this post, we're all excited for this and try to tone down the hostility.
---
Yeah, his reasoning for not thinking he would like Classic is a lot more nuanced than you seem to be letting on. It's discussed many times in the video. He literally discusses this within the first three minutes of the video:
---
&gt; ..but for me, I've lived through Classic. I was there from day 1, I was in the beta, I played it all the way through and I was done with that journey as far as I was concerned, like Preach of three weeks ago was done with that journey. And Blizzard asked me about classic several times over the last couple of months....
---
&gt; ... and my answer was always pretty much the same thing - I'm not interested in the content... I've done Molten Core and all the way to Naxx, I'm done with that stuff. That's not what I'm interested in. What I am interested in is the community aspects of it, like that's stuff I really want to experience again...
---
The way you're presenting "ignorant"  within the greater context of your comments seems to be insinuating that he is ignorant about what makes Classic different from BfA. He's always been very knowledgeable about that, and was never a naysayer in any video I've seen him talk about Classic. He totally did and does understand, and never needed to "see the light", aside from realizing personally that he actually will personally put more time in the game than he thought.
---
Release TBC on all servers in ~2 years, create new servers for those that want to stay in Vanilla. But they have to start from scratch.
---
Literal Warstomp 31/7/13 GOD SPEC.

I actually don't remember if the ghostwolf was worth I just know for most of Vanilla i was 31/X/X. and I tried the ghostwolf out for a bit.
---
4 years would be entirely too long
---
I just pull off the pet pre kill, fixed the hassle for me
---
&gt;professions
---
start off with skinning+ mining/herbing. crafting professions are able to make money later on, but the first goal should be your mount at 40. you can always change your professions later on.
---
&gt;respecs
---
hard? no, a few clicks
---
costly? yes, especially if you try to go back and forth between pvp and pve specs as the price increases with every respec (caps out at a certain value).
---
&gt; Is there any class/build that can do both easily?
---
warlock with SM/ruin is as good as it gets, most classes have some kind of pve/pvp spec which wont be ideal for either but you can get away with it unless your guild wants hardcore progression
---
I say the Hunter class is just not that good. But a better player can still kill other people with it. But you can't make miracles happen
---
oh wow got to level 30 before I learned this
---
‚ÄúNot liking it much‚Äù != disliking.  Same as disliking != hating.
---
I wouldn't mind transmog months after last phase.
---
Warlock Naxxramas record on Private servers is 1111.1 dps.  Theres only a total of 5 warriors and 3 rogues that have higher than that.  So you're wrong, a very good warlock can top DPS charts.  You talk like a 15 year old, highly doubt you played classic

 Scientists have concluded that this is the last image that the human brain creates before death. Could this be the face of God?

Nefarion buff only works like that on private servers. In vanilla only the person turning in the quest got the buff.
---
Prioritize BT, it's more dmg than a 20 rage execute. Basically in any situation you could use both you wanna do bloodthirst first, that's at least what ppl keep telling me.

---
Well I am trying to be positive and think that satisfied fans and community is what will drag blizzard out of the shithole they are in, and thus bring them the most money. 
---
Wow 2.0 sounds like a dream but so was the classic wow untill official announcement.
---
Casual guilds who raid in vanilla still buff
---
Bring consumes. Just not ALL of them. Buffs/consumes are a massive % of stats available to a player in an engagement. Some are much more expensive/time consuming than others to get tho. 
---
But you can't have ANY standards if I as a DPS warriors who brings no consumes and is in PvP spec is still trouncing my ret Pala who does everything as you would in a hardcore guild but play the right spec.
---
You just throw your guild into disarray
---
Which is why guilds like Esfand's can't clear any content. Because his presence guts any ability to hold your guild to any workable standards.
---
All you'd have to say is "well we give esfand loot look at his dps, and we even wait for him to drink". And again he's playing it about as well as one could. Doesn't get better from there
---
the point of the game is literally to get a chance to play the game exactly as it was 14 years ago. If that's not what you want, you should not be here. There are plenty of new convenient MMOs to play
---
blizzard is hiding the truth, sort of like a white lie. it has done it before and it has reasons to do that.
---
you kinda want proof, right?
---
if you watch this https://www.twitch.tv/videos/428799948?t=33m44s  at 37:19 mark kern is saying that blizzard has actually lost the data and recover some from nostalrius team. i have no idea why kern would lie about this, i see no benefit for him.
---
on the other hand blizzard has stated numerous times that their main concern was that ppl abandoned the game before lvl 30 because they found it too hard so they kept nerfing down the old content for leveling. 
---
&gt; This has been disproved.
---
regarding this, blizzard just said "you need to trust us on this" without providing any evidence. they could present the patch notes where it is written, for example, that the mobs have been demoted from elites to normal. but guess what?  there are [none for classic and TBC](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/8-1-5) on the official site! we only have unreliable, external sources that anyone ca edit. this also points out that blizzard has lost some of the vanilla data.
---
the mobs in question where elites for at least 90% of the vanilla duration and got nerfed right before TBC in order to make leveling easier for the new players to catch up with the veterans that only had to lvl from 60 to 70. entrances to instances were guarded by elites.
---
also many that played the game back then are remembering that mobs where a lot harder in instances at least. tanks where not supposed to survive getting pounded by 3-4 elites while in battle stance with 2h and deathwish on  [like this](https://clips.twitch.tv/GeniusAthleticDonkeyBibleThump). in vanilla this would've meant almost instant death. 
---
that also points out that defensive stance and 1h + shield is obsolete at level 30 which leads to what? a design flaw? why make shields for that lvl if there is no need for them?! whats the point in damage reduction defensive stance?!
---
they did the same with AV, providing the nerfed version that was live for a short while at the end of vanilla. they are actually removing the grind and the hardships. the only unbearable thing now left is the grand marshal grind. they are providing the nerfed version of vanilla because a lot of ppl expressed concern that they not have time for wow like they did 15 years ago. this is understandable even though you dont actually need to do all the content but dont push the "vanilla was hard" narrative when you're not gonna make it like that anymore.
---
there's a lot more to say but i know a lot of reddit users are downvoting brainlessly without any counterargument so why bother?  :)
---
Golden may be shit, but nothing tops Richard Knaak in pure shittiness. He was given the task of writing a trilogy about the War of the Ancients. What does he make? A trilogy about his Mary Sue character Rhonin traveling to the past to help out in the War of the Ancients. The same Rhonin that was given a smoking hot elf wife that's also a Windrunner in his first novel.
---
This passage from the Wiki article on Rhonin says everything:
---
&gt;While in the past, Rhonin encountered legendary beings such as Cenarius, Malorne, and Aviana. He became friends with the heroes Illidan Stormrage, Malfurion Stormrage, Tyrande Whisperwind, Jarod Shadowsong, Maiev Shadowsong, and Shandris Feathermoon. Rhonin actually became Illidan's mentor, not in the least to try and harness his reckless power, but despite Illidan's admiration much of Rhonin's work involved cleaning up Illidan's mistakes.
---
It sounds like an actual fan fiction recap.
---
Oh my god, I forgot about this bug. Given all the drama that surrounded my guild back in the day, I am shocked we managed to clear BWL without the entire guild collapsing.
---
I remember the entire raid would strip naked during the pull in case this happened, and we all had macros to put on all of our gear when the pull went smoothly.
---
I‚Äôm glad to hear I‚Äôm not the only one.
---
Once I got invited to a ZG raid and proceeded to soulstone myself. I'm still sorry about that.
---
Yes that‚Äôs a good way to get a discussion going. Flame the people that don‚Äôt agree with you. That really backs up your point.
---
They are using the same framework from BFA. It's a lot more demanding now.
---
So you have two options:
---
Take the crafting professions and craft the gear yourself
---
Farm the gold and buy the gear.
---
It can be a pain getting the patterns.  For example, Lionheart Helm is pretty much BiS for warriors until Naxx, but the pattern is rare, and the helm itself is pretty expensive.  Same goes with Flask recipes for alchemists.
---
In a lot of cases, guilds might give patterns to their members so they can craft exclusively for the guild.  If you don't think that's an option for yourself, then it might be best to go two gathers profs, or mining/engineering and try to make enough gold to buy the gear yourself.
---
You had way faster internet 15 years ago then i have today.
---
Compete with yourself

The only buff name I like better is the one Thrall gives tanks during an encounter in Dragon Soul. "Last Defender of Azeroth". Absolute *peak* for Tank buffs. 
---
Just a wicked name, and it was strong as shit too since the fight was basically a huge DPS/Healing race while the boss mauled your tanks IIRC.
---
I don't really like the idea of fresh servers constantly coming out.  Private servers have proved that it kills the population of older servers, so all the progress on your older chars are essentially meaningless since it's on a dead server.
---
&gt; Why people think they should be allowed to play whatever they want...
---
Holy shit, dude, are you serious?
---
Pay my sub.  Until then, I'm playing what I want.  I'm sure you look forward to not grouping with players like me, and I assure you that the feeling is mutual.
---
I'm just watching the old Classic videos, figuring out what I'll main, reading guides. 
---
I can't enjoy other games too, especially the current WoW. I login, do WQs, maybe some rated PvP and logout. I don't even bother with weekly M+ anymore. BfA is bad, but damn knowing Classic is coming I can't enjoy anything about it.
---
There are games like Mordhau than can definitely entertain for a while, but it's not a game I'd play for long.
---
I was thinking about trying a new MMO or even a private server (haven't played on private servers for years) but I'm deciding if it's really worth it starting completely new for like 3 months.
---
Expectations vs reality, lol. I probably won't even be close to the 4 or 5 day mark by that sounding. Plus private server vs live data is always different. So I can imagine during live it'll probably take me much longer. Definitely going to enjoy it as much as I can. thanks!
---
If WoW 2 is great, I‚Äôd pay $30 per month to play. $15 from 2004 in today‚Äôs money, after inflation, is around $30. No mtx needed. Make the game good and people will sub.
---
One should mention that a "good" raid leader who min maxes, switches the shamans around, providing manatide for healers and switching back for melee group.  
---
At least that's what I heard.
---
They already came out and said that they won't be naming the new servers after the old ones.
---
Can't remember which interview but I think it was Ion and the other dude with the goatee. It was a recent interview I think that they did with Tipsout when the beta and release date were announced.
---
Once the release date was announced it became real.
---
Before that the anticipation was built on dreams... now its cemented in reality.
---
The wait is real now.
---
Maybe streaming isn't for you, but people who stream actually enjoy it.. that's... why they do it.
---
You're actually only getting "paid" about $6 an hour in this hypothetical. So yeah it actually seems pretty worth it lol
---
Dual spec, in mostly every mmo; tanks and healers are played by less players and it's obvious why. Gives them the choice of healing/tanking when they need to and damage when they want to.
---
If I'm going to be someone's heal bitch for the rest of a game then it would be nice to swap without the cost.
---
I think he just liked the convenience of having one button to push, outside of his cooldowns (shield wall, last stand, etc..)
---
He would watch threat meters like a hawk and be sure to bark at anyone that was getting too close to slow down, I can still here his voice to this day. He was an older guy, heavy set, pretty hairy, motorcycle 'gang' type with a bit of a New York accent. Our guild name started with a W, and he said at one point "Listen, if we kill Nef this week with no wipes, I'll shave a W into my chest".
---
We one-shot Nef, and he shaved his W into his chest. I have the pic somewhere, lmao.
---
He was kind of our guild mascot.
---
Lets be honest, the streamers who play wow deserve every penny they get for all of the funny omegalul moments and hours of entertainment they provide to this community. We should all do our part and support them. I've already given Soda $100. He even said my name and it made me all warm and fuzzy inside. I plan on putting back about $500 this year to donate to him and Asmongold. I just love donating to my favorite streamers and my favorite game! =)
---
Go Gnome lock if you want to try hard tho, they're best in both PvP and pve
---
Nefarion and Onyxia buffs are only city-wide on private servers. In vanilla only the person turning in the quest got the buff.
---
You won't grt those numbers with fedex levelling even.
---
Nature's Swiftness is just so powerful. I wouldn't skip that :P
---
The RPG books are for lore, the novels are for Mary Sue fan fiction vomit.
---
I mean you've mostly just misrepresented information or tried to quote me out of context during all of your interventions. You should no faith in a discussion aha
---
It actually helps them.
---
To confirm, a normal sub gets you access to both bfa and classic
---
&gt;streaming just ruins it completely
---
Streaming is a job.  They are forced to play what pays regardless of what they think about the games.
---
Eh the druid healer has rebirth if someone else dies. No way to res the druid otherwise though
---
&gt; We aren't regardless. We're having the massive class revamps from day 1. That's already a completely different experience than vanilla.
---
And they hated him for he spoke the truth.
---
oh his comment seemed like a legit serious suggestion to me
---
1.8 GHz CPU ... I agree with /u/Minkelz
---
That sucks. Would have nice to use my old laptop from 2008 again. 
---
Windows vista 64bit. Lol
---
I'm actually excited because I am using the time to beat some games I know I won't come back to. Zelda BotW is a great game, but I know I won't even touch my switch when Classic launches.
---
Sadly, a lot of people on here have never and will never understand this.
---
Dunno if theres a huge difference. But i just soloed that fortress as hunter (no pet since only lvl 8) on a Private server. As a wow noob. Dont wanna be a dick, but how do people have problems killing him as 2+ people?
---
yeah same man, i cant find many people today that were in beta with a fileplanet sub but that was the main reason i got it back then
---
Lmao slideshow
---
I don't mind little bits at a time but after listening to it for hours it gets pretty annoying. However I do still prefer the old sound to the new.
---
They are using the same framework from Legion, not BFA. Specifically, it's a fork of version 7.3.5.
---
What's the problem? Cant you handle google drive?
---
1000 gold!
---
Haha, yup yup!
---
They are dying down a bit for me since most the top streamers are level 30 already and going on crazy stints for gear/crafting/wsg that I'll never achieve as I'm a casual, but have found some others like XQC that just started and don't play it for 16 hours a day.
---
After that I'll probably actually have to head on over to pornhub for real WoW porn.
---
money is why they do it
---
The wait is killing me!!! As others have said, 90 days out is way too long. There's so much hype around Classic right now that everyone is just going to be burnt out on being hyped before the release date lol. We're all going to be over classic by the time it's released...
---
I would love for them to expand on classic but they will probably just rerelease their bad expansions until we are back at bad wow. I would rather have 2 completely different wows releasing new content and it would help with longevity. 
---
Wrath feels more like new wow than TBC imo. TBC added many things i didn't like for example dailies, flying, no 40 mans, resilience gear just to name a couple. But still TBC was the beginning of the end even tough it's still the 2nd best version of wow we've got.
---
Keep the slow speed, difficulty leveling, time consuming for consumables/ worthwhile professions making gold useful, raid size, community features, power curve, PvP setup, linear raids.
---
I think splintering the community with 10 different versions of wow will be short lived and i would much prefer two very different versions of wow over slowly sprinkling back in the things that made wow not for me.
---
In some cases yes, in some no.
---
*Druids - if both feral, then yes.  If one feral one resto or balance, then no.
---
*Hunters - both of you need a good ranged weapon, everything else is gravy.
---
*Mages - as long as one of you has tailoring, you'll get all the frost gear you need
---
*Paladins - if one is holy and one is ret, no issue
---
*Priests - may stumble against each other, but already a bad pairing to begin with
---
*Rogues - will probably stumble against each other, part of why they're B-Tier
---
*Shamans - if one is enhance and the other is ele/resto, no issue
---
*Warlocks - will probably stumble against each other, part of why they're B-Tier
---
*Warriors - will definitely stumble against each other, but again, already a bad pairing
---
Was awesome back in 2008. Excellent frame rates and super hot exhaust to keep me warm in bed playing. 
---
$1499.99 üòÇ
---
I completely agree with this. 90 days feels like forever. Everyone is going to be burnt out on Classic before it even releases lo.
---
Mind flay‚Äôs animation shoots beams of energy into the target‚Äôs eyes/face, even on character models which aren‚Äôt humanoid.
---
INFP-T Orc Horde Warrior Tank who does not really enjoy pvp. I guess this fits the Mediator profile.
---
Gonna have to update to at least Windows 7 first
---
Isn't that what they are using in BFA also?
---
Ooooor, i've seen vanilla/classic/TLP server happening in other game, like Everquest, and I have a pretty good feeling how thing will turn out.
---
I'm also in this subreddit cause I got beta access... but yeah, this sub have a real lack of usefull content, i'll agree.
---
This made me throw up in my mouth, just enough for that terrible stinging sensation in the back of my throat, but not enough to warrant the toilet. It tasted like my last meal only sour.. thanks for that.
---
Yep, this is normal for someone who has stress test access, but not beta. Looks like you're in the stress test!
---
Love this reply, you listed some interesting things here.
---
Thanks guys! Though I will be raiding fairly casually, I always enjoy min/maxing my character. So if I can eek out a little more dps I think engineering is the way I'll go :)
---
Thats cuz you get your "mana" from Health. And you frequently have to sit down to eat
---
üò≠
---
I want it to be 1000g just to spite mr. 25g here
---
he's basically just saying he agrees and he thinks its a pretty insightful thought
---
I think it wasn't as popular back then. Why save the head if someone will most likely pop it in your raid day and you won't get the buff.
---
can you hide cloaks in classic? I wasn't playing when it came out so Im not sure when transmog became a thing
---
That still leaves dots to contend with, but yeah. A drain soul alone deals 2% of a mobs health per tick at my level. That would be fairly difficult to reliably pull off a kill with.
---
I was NS for a fairbit too. I just liked to abuse my warstomp in its place as well. I 100% agree its more powerful than the 31 point ele talent, but the 31 ele talent was just a fun animation to go with my Zandalarian Hero Charm.
---
It's stupid easy to get it caught up to 100 as alliance. Go to goldshire and fish that lake by there. There is a vendor that sells recipes for the frogs and the 30 hp fish that helps get you super far and you get your fishing to 100 too which you can use to fish up health pots behind the goldshire in or go to the river between elywynn and westfall and fish up random profession materials
---
You didn‚Äôt have class trainers or auction house in Shat. You still went to the necessary faction capital city to get those services. Even then, outside of mainly IF and Org, the capital cities were only used for a specific purpose (trainers) not available elsewhere or while leveling. The numbers of people hanging out in Darn or UC/TB didn‚Äôt compare to the primary capitals. The closest was SW (some servers favored SW while others favored IF, the only capitals like this).
---
So while everything was made more convenient in TBC, it isn‚Äôt near as bad as you are making it. They took out what many consider to be unnecessary bullshit (let‚Äôs be real, having to make a trip to Scholo/BWL for flasks was bullshit).
---
&gt; I agree that frequent/easy respeccing breaks a core pillar of RPG, but so does not being able to
---
oh man that is a serious galaxy brain take
---
Minor correction, the cooking book is in Shadowprey Village in Desolace, you are thinking of the first aid one which is in Dustwallow :)
---
I was watching a video today by someone on YouTube saying with the old talent trees there wasn‚Äôt an actual spec for each class.  This confused the shit out of me.  If it‚Äôs referring to Hybrid classes then I can see that but it just didn‚Äôt seem right to me.  I remember playing as full specced marks hunter and full subtlety rogue.  
---
But this is exactly one of the reasons I‚Äôm looking forward to playing classic!  I can be a real mage again or anything I want really! 
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not a huge fan of azerite gear or the new talent trees.  You have to kind of build your talents in almost a similar fashion as everyone else and the randomness of the azerite traits is ridiculous.  I want to be able to have more say so of my class/spec.
---
Sure, and we've had 15 years of systems growth beyond stuff Blizzard has done. Yes, maybe layering can be abused. But it's silly to think Blizzard wont or even cant take counter-measures.
---
Those people don't deserve to raid with others who do anything more than the bare minimum.
---
You made a list. I copy and pasted that list. I get told that‚Äôs out of context
---
???
---
Classic: Help someone, they might help you, or hold you in good standing for future references.
---
Retail: Helping others is a waste of time, because you have a laundry list of errands to run. WQs, daily chest, weekly this and that, daily pvp, etc.
---
I'd support it if it's like Ulduar hard modes. That has precedent going back to Ahn'Qiraj, with the Bug Family encounter, where the kill order determined difficulty and loot. The Hard Mode feels like it really is additional content, rather than just higher numbers.
---
harder than what?
---
There is a bit more going on than just a title change between the letters L F R and the word mythic, to be fair. 
---
M+ can be done without a mic until like 15+. I‚Äôve never been a part of a successful current tier mythic raid without a considerable amount of communicatiom, certainly much more than was standard in classic and would be needed for the vast majority of classic fights if on comms. (I mean shit, my first raid guild did mc and bwl in 2005 only using raid, whispers and guild chat‚Äîmy other vanilla guild that I got to huhu with had nearly everyone muted once trash was cleared until the boss was dead except for tanks, raid leaders, and people with specific assignments who needed to talk....meanwhile on live, just watch the GM of Limit raid lead one night, there is constant raid relevant chatter from 1/2 the raid over any 1 minute period.)
---
Classic is better in every aspect like you said, except combat (not that bfa is combat at its best, I think that goes to Wrath-MoP rotations) problem is combat is a huge part of the game.
---
this subreddit has really given people some madly wrong impressions on streamers. 
---
Sure there's some idiots out there who think they are gonna get money streaming, but they are in the minority. Most streamers just stream because they enjoy it, and when they grow big enough and realize they can actually sustain themselves from something as crazy as playing videogames for an audience, then that influences and often makes them sell out and do the best to maintain it. But it started as a hobby for everyone.
---
It's called Outfitter. Not sure if the 1.12 version works in Classic though
---
And the crazy thing is it‚Äôs almost impossible for someone to be a server first raider and a grand marshal/high warlord because of the amount of farm time that either option requires. Which gives such a feeling of real choices and takes committing to what you primarily want to achieve
---
To add to this, it allows players to make meaningful decisions in their talent specs that reflect how they spend their time in the game. There are many specs that have talent points that are required to be effective at your role and talent points where you get to pick between a couple of different things based on how you play. Sure there's usually something that is optimal in a pve raiding environment, but maybe it doesn't matter too much and you can replace it with something that is really great in another aspect of the game.
---
For example: improved gouge vs dodge chance for a combat rogue.
---
Dodge is better for raiding because almost nothing is gougeable in a raid, at least you can evasion-tank a little better or avoid a few more cleaves if you take the dodge. But improved gouge let's you pick an herb in combat or get a couple of extra ticks on a bandage in a 1v1 PvP scenario.
---
The Vanilla talent system is designed to make you make decisions, and dual-spec or low-cost respecs destroy that aspect of the game. A big part of compelling gameplay is making meaningful decisions and having to live with the consequences.
---
I'd get something with a graphics card
---
I love the fanatical classic defenders.
---
somehow M+ is a shit system, but somehow they'll enjoy spamming the heck out of BRS/strat/scholo.
---
somehow BFA itemization is awful, but they don't see any problem with 5 man becoming irrelevant super quick minus the odd HoJ trinket / ironfoe like item.
---
Meanwhile they are talking about how hard classic was... when most classes have a 3 button rotation. Heck, healers can do naxx with only 1 button! FoL spam ftw!
---
I also love how classic player pretend nobody play BFA, but brag about Nost or wathever pserver reaching 10k player online...
---
really cute.
---
Another great reply, this is the information I want. I don't want people telling me that I have to play that one class, I want general information about the game style of classes so that I can choose my class.
---
...and I will say it again.  He never said it did.
---
This. 
---
I actually think that the osrs model is what classic wow needs.
---
You know teh implication was "play what you want and expect people to group"
---
Obviously if you play solo, do whatever you want. 
---
Why do you think anyone would care? DO you hear yourself? lol
---
Need to work on that reading comprehension. How you could have interpreted what I said that way is beyond me. 
---
Pay your sub, lol
---
If you join a team as a non optimal spec on an MMO patch that will never change. You are the worst kind of human
---
Some one shoulda taken a belt to you and taught you about the importance of competency and not letting your team down. Whether that be in work or a game
---
Ughhhhhh people like you disgust me, the worst kind of useless men. It's a game the whole point is to WIN. Or feel like you did
---
I made a decent buck leveling an alt on another server than my main by making target dummies and farming them for their fused wiring. Definitely not out of the question
---
*Alliance wins* 
---
Checks out
---
servers would be dead as fuck for 2 years
---
Stratholme Holy Water is a cheaper alternative.
---
I would prefer to play in a guild where no one is required to use consumables and we take whatever classes people in the guild want to play. That way people are playing casually and not stressing over raiding.
---
Will that hypothetical guild compete with your super optimal minmax guild? Hell No but it's not a fucking race. Every single reply your getting is arguing against you so just accept the idea that everyone doesn't want to play the game the same way and fuck off
---
Have fun with your server firsts and we will have fun with whatever we are doing.
---
You don't just turn on the stream and suddenly pay the bills man that's not how streaming works. It takes months if not years to build an audience for you to actually make money, and if you don't enjoy it, then you are NEVER going to make it. Almost all streamers start as a hobby, and when they get big and money becomes involved sure lots get greedy and sellout.
---
If you can get it. Go for it. It looks sick and people will know you‚Äôre serious. Just know that unyielding maw is very very close to being just as good. 
---
Tanking as a bear is really fun though. Highly recommended. 
---
HotW is definitely a good route to go on for both PvE and PvP
---
Well then it's already failed. The class changes are all going to be in from day 1. A massive improvement to vanilla.
---
I guess you shouldn't be here either?
---
Only people OK with improvements to vanilla are going to be able to play classic, because class improvements and many other important gameplay, CC, and itemization improvements will be in from day 1.
---
&gt; &gt; So do fury tanks avoid all defense gear? Without sitting to proc enrage, it seems you would have to - otherwise the talent becomes useless.
---
Not quite - a few examples for a guild that's progressed through BWL are:
---
Helm - Wrath is fine, but if you have good healers you can use lionheart with +100 HP. Helm of Endless Rage works as well due to high stam and offensive stats.
---
Neck: Ony Neck over a tank neck. This is an easy place to pick up +hit.
---
Shoulders - Drake Talon Pauldrons over T2 - You get more offensive stats while picking up some HP and dodge.
---
Cloak - Zulian Tigerhide Cloak (15 agi +1 hit) - One of the few cloaks with hit
---
Chest - T2 Chest due to limited options and high stam/def stats
---
Bracers - T2 are fine because of high stam, but they can use bracers of true flight for +hit if needed.
---
Gloves - Gauntlets of Might
---
Belt - Onslaught Girdle
---
Legs - Wrath is fine due to high HP and no better threat options.
---
Boots - Chromatic Boots - Decent def stats (stam/agi) and + hit
---
Rings - Masterdragon slayer/donjulios
---
Trinkets - DFT (yes tanks should get it) and Gem
---
Bow - Satyr's bow for +hit
---
The idea is that you're picking up hit and offensive stats where you can without sacrificing too many defensive stats. You aren't in full damage gear, but you want enough hit to be able to land all your yellows and more whites.
---
&gt;In protection - one handed spec, shield slam, and imp sunder all contribute to threat. Shield slam especially.
---
You aren't wrong here, fury is just better threat for a majority of the time you spend raiding. Shield Slam/Impale is a viable spec for progression when your tank needs to be using a shield.
---
Also - consider rage generation. If you're using a 1H+Shield, you can't spam abilities like you can when you dual wield. With dual wield, you have almost 100% uptime on heroic strike while still being able to spam your other abilities. This is due to rage from the increased damage you're taking + OH damage. So having points in improved sunder is more of a bandage to help with poor rage generation, compared to being able to spam sunder with a fury/defiance spec. Your threat is exponentially higher due to your rage generation.
---
Of course all of this is dependent on classic being similar to pservers. I also wouldn't recommend the guild stepping into their first raid in 10+ years to do this. If you're DPS isn't pushing high threat, you can probably put on more defensive stats since you don't have to worry about threat. The amount of threat gear a tank uses is solely dependent on the raid's threat.
---
&gt; My recollection is that keeping tanks alive isn't trivial, even when prot, using defense gear, and shield block to push crushing off the list.
---
If your tank gets to the point they can push crushing blows off the table, their threat will be terrible. You have to sacrifice so many threat stats to get to that point. It's better to load up on as much HP as possible and bring an extra healer if need be.
---
Just some other things to vomit out here since I've been rambling:
---
A tank in full defense gear means DPS can't go as hard. This makes fights take longer and increases the chances that something goes wrong. For example my guild killed Fankriss in under a minute on our first AQ 40 clear. Having a dual-wield tank with high threat allowed us to bypass the mechanics of the fight. Same for Huhu - our tank dual-wields and then switches to 1H+Shield for shield wall at 30% so that we can push through the enrage phase quickly. However, they still use full tank gear (with enough +hit to land yellows) on Twins because of Unbalancing Strike and exploding bugs.
---
You're also right about this being used on farm content. Something to think about though is how much of your time spent in raids will be after you have it on farm. Classic will be here for a long time - your DPS will become really geared. What's the point of them having all that DPS gear if they have to hold back or the tank can't hold threat?
---
Deep Prot will work fine for most guilds during progression. Once the raid is on farm after a few weeks, you'll want your tanks to go fury/defiance. Otherwise you're just going to have threat issues or continue to clear content at the same pace.
---
People told me the same thing (not as harshly) when I started playing WoW in 2004.  They said to go any thing but hunter, they are terrible. 
---
They were wrong.  I had a blast on my hunter.  And vanilla was the best time I had on my hunter.  It has a lot of room for skill.  
---
You have to be prepared to push past the class limitations and borderline break the class to get the most out of a hunter.  That's what steperates a huntard from a skilled hunter.
---
There are some things I found experimenting that I've never heard any one mention.  (I did hear about some meme builds on private servers that look an aweful lot like some of the stuff I did)
---
Don't private servers use 1.12 talents?

on the battle.net launcher
---
lmfao ok bud, says the guy who says retail wow is hard...
---
Thank you. This is my point. Options have always existed for those who don't want to commit time/energy to something in the game. 
---
Yet time and time again Blizz caves to those who complain the loudest. LFD/LFR and all this cross-server garbage is more proof of that. 
---
Blizz at one time did care about their playerbase and we had a great product, but over time they only cared about catering to the masses in order to rake in even more money. 
---
Even the release of Classic is simply to lure more subs back. They finally realized there is this untapped pool of players they can bring back.
---
I'm having fun with Auto Chess, but I really want WoW.
---
Both
---
Your mistake is thinking it has to be one specific thing.
---
&gt; when your GM already says Hand of Rag is reserved for you, and you're gonna 2H pvp
---
Found the one of the original QQer‚Äôs.
---
Every expansion was a "learning" experience and look where the game ended up.
---
For a private server it seems slow. On Classic it would be fine. The streams I've watched most achieved like one level per hour until 25+.
---
I don't think this has clicked with him yet.. projection is powerful with this one calling others "low IQ players"
---
Holy shit
---
Damn, you saw right through me haha.
---
Those few paragraphs have me hooked and coming back hoping there‚Äôs somehow more
---
Yes and so will classic. That's why using vanilla data to see how good dps is at early stages is pointless. Sure private servers have inaccuracies, but it's nothing compared to the massive difference between 1.12 and say 1.6 talents.
---
I mean, it's not like you need a macro to dps as warlock. You literally just spam shadowbolt.
---
Why‚Äôd it get downvoted ? Only watched 1/3rd of the vid but nothing seemed out of the ordinary.
---
Why I believe I can be that good because I've been. So what's to say that I won't be again? But yea could you tell me your honest opinion If I said I am among the 95% best?
---
That's probably the biggest problem with this. Everybody is just going to assume they are lagging like crazy.
---
The vast majority of people who stream don't earn anything close to minimum wage. They stream because they think it's fun. Even streamers who make it have gone through a very long process of streaming for nothing at all.
---
Did they ever make it to Hyjal last night? I was watching for a while and last I saw they were corpse running in wintergrasp a bunch
---
Pretty sure you could purge soul link. Maybe not by 1.12 but early on you totally could.
---
Druids:
---
Hibernate steelsnap, root one add, kill the other. Reapply hibernate to steelsnap, kill second add. Heal up then kill steelsnap with regrowth and rejuvenate still rolling. Easiest quest of your life.
---
Other classes: reroll Druid idiot.
---
one of these things is nothing like the others
---
tbh when in doubt try them on a private server, its not like blizz lets us buy access to beta
---
Hi, /u/keatonb87
---
Yea that's a huge topic with WoW. No one enjoys being ganked, not many enjoy ganking, 95% of wPvP is ganking - yet the majority prefers PvP servers. Maybe it's the magic of those 5%, maybe the feeling of danger and faction rivalry...
---
thank you I‚Äôve made my choice off this
---
I could see them doing YT adds, but at the earliest 1 month before release. Right now would be way to early, since we are talking about a product that can‚Äôt be preordered anyway.
---
you need an invite.   you need sub to get invite.   if you sub now you probably wont get invite so quickly
---
You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôve been holding off too but I‚Äôve got the itch bad to play. Probably drop in on it tonight now.
---
Unfortunately, it impacts the UI (sometimes quite negatively)
---
OTOH, some people are goal oriented, and the faction rewards are only available for doing their BG.
---
I think you would need to go to therapy then, so no more playing for you...
---
I only made it to Nax a couple of times before TBC, but I would that leveling one the reason I fell in love with the game. I would say that for me it was more 50-50 enjoyment level leveling vs endgame. But I guess it is individual
---
Only guy i know who got r14 effectively dropped out of high school for a solid semester to make it happen.
---
They ruined tanking in Wrath, that‚Äôs true. But all dps classes got better in terms of engaging sustained dps rotations.

It's a lot easier if you enjoy fishing.
---
I always level fishing and cooking together. It's a nice way to make some extra coin, and it makes it a lot easier to keep cooking at a useful level.
---
I've been debating this back and forth myself for months now, and I've finally settled on Lock for a multitude of reasons, many of which have been listed in other comments, so the only one I'll add that I haven't seen so far is that Warlock has SM/Ruin which is good for both PvP and PvE, which is a huge selling point for someone like me who will be playing both aspects fairly equally but refuses to farm 100g a week to respec between raids.
---
I tried and tried to get a build that would do Raiding, PvP and AoE farming as a mage, but the fact that frostbite is so good for PvP, and so bad for the other 2 makes it very difficult.
---
Monopoly hinders progress for sure. The tele communications companies where I live (Denmark) can't have monopolies by law, internet is seen as a public necessity/human right - same as water and electricity. The internet wars have raged for the last 15 years, and as a result, 100mbit connections are super affordable, I even know people that opted for 1gbit because the price isn't insane anymore.  
---
All public mail (from like courts and other governmental departments) are now mailed to every citizen via the internet too, unless they specifically opted out, something only a handful of elderly have done since they cant/dont want to deal with the interwebz.  
---
And we still don't hold a candle to Norway and Sweden, our Scandinavian brethren. Their average speeds are higher than ours D:
---
I'd love unyielding maul but then I'd have to wait for DM to release, I'm planning on doing a lot of dungeons before that. I'm a bit worried about doing HoTw spec and being a gimped healer and a gimped tank while not doing any of the roles particularly well.
---
I honestly cannot play any other game...
---
Just play a private server?
---
They said they wouldn't do it because they thought it would be too technically challenging to be worth it; IE, they thought they would have to essentially re-write the entire game in order for it to work; something that could take years to complete.
---
It wasn't until Nost shut down, and Mark Kern delivered the 200k signatures to Mike Morhaime that they too another serious look at it and Omar Gonzalez was able to make the modern client read the old code, which saved them TONS of time and effort.
---
Sure money is a motivation, but for most players that already have a wow sub, they won't be making any more money off of them than they would have gotten anyway.
---
I've had a couple fun on level fights. But very few.
---
But warrior you tried to attack me at the bottom of a lake. Haha, you need to breath and I can fear kite you
---
Oh really? So you have a job and you get paid potatos? Because yeah...money ! Money is bad !
---
Yesss the silver xp theme
---
It was never 12. 
---
It was 8 and then increased to 16 in 1.7.  In 1.11 debuffs gained their priority system.  
---
The post is a really cursory analysis and not that accurate.  e.g. the poster writing off Gift of Arthas, concluding that you wouldn't get 38.5 physical attacks off in 3 seconds (or really 12.5 hits per second).  
---
Really though, if you had a decent number of rogues, fury warriors, and hunters that should be a pretty easy number to hit.  Rogues using a 2.6 and 1.5 would be attacking ~2.0 and 1.15 which is 1.3 attacks per second per rogue, counting just white hits even in bad gear (miss chance) that's still expected 1.1 hits per second.  SS would add another .5 to that bringing it up to 1.6 hits per second.  8 rogues *alone* would beat out 100 dps with Gift of Arthas.  
---
But since that's a lot of rogues, Fury Warriors are less but still a decent number of hits with flurry and DW.  
---
And AFAIK it also counted for hunters and their physical attacks (Aimed shot and auto shot and multi shots).  
---
In short, it would be easy to hit that number with a normal raid comp that didn't for some reason completely avoid rogues and fury warriors.  Plus it increases the tank's threat... 
---
And you still didn't answer which of those buffs was "utterly useless."
---
1k crits emerged for rogues in 19 when the leg enchants were released and the TBC mailbox enchant exploit because you could stock AP, even then it was someone sat on the floor in a dual simply for numbers.
---
The only thing in vanilla close to the leg enchants available in later expansions is Naxx shoulder on white item.
---
Play rogue.
---
That's why you sneak up on cloth wearer's that are sitting down and drinking in the middle of WSG.
---
Shamans have ghetto stealth (ghost wolf) thats harder to see than my fat tauren ass, so once a month or so you manage to sneak up on someone and one-shot them.
---
That once a month occurrence made it all worth while.
---
God, this reminds me of Vanilla so much. Nobody could spell "Rogue". Even the rogues began calling it Rouge.
---
As a warlock main I can tell you that soul shards aren't as much of a hindrance as you may think. Soul bag is usually full just from farming and shit. I've also played rogue and mage in vanilla on private servers and it really depends on what you like. There's some really good class breakdowns on YouTube that should help.
---
Sending mail wasn't actually instant.  Took time to go from AH -&gt; your mailbox, sending something to yourself took time, took like an hour even if you COD'd if im not wrong.
---
Cool. But talk to Op because he did say and has said it many times in the comment. Y‚Äôall have y‚Äôall a stories mixed up here.
---
Was that ice cream cake place any good?
---
Why do people keep mentioning this as if it has any relevance? It was a screw up in the earliest days of the game that was fixed almost immediately.
---
Items are attached to  the staged content unlock plan. Patch 1.9 aka AQ war effort is phase 5, so it shouldn't be in the game. 1.12 affects  class design, bg mechanics, and stats on existing items.
---
Opening in a new tab works for me on mobile (android) using chrome browser.

Lol whoops

An actual Asmongold chair! Nice.

Finish Naxx obv
---
Both methods end with a death.
---
Yea exploration is slow af, again people can down vote all they want but at 30 min after launch when you /who there will be lvl 5s. You can have a not remind you.
---
Ok now you are just blatantly lying haha.  Why you gotta be like this dude?
---
Yep, you can choose to hide the cloak from the UI.  Transmogs are not a thing though.
---
I wouldn't recommend druid to a new player.
---
I agree 100% about WotLK, but in spite of the changes that I didn't like, I still had a metric ton of fun in that expansion.
---
Bro there are gonna be a ton of us in your same position.  Kids / jobs all the good stuff.  15 years have passed I know for sure there will be guilds doing 1 raid night a week etc. don‚Äôt stress it
---
Found the homeless kid who dropped out of high school.
---
Because no one says druids are bad at pvp, and *especially* at low levels. It's just some dude's terrible pvp video from 15 years ago, it's spam.
---
L O L guys im laughing out loud. Ok virgin ill stay out of clasic cause a retard from reddit told me to. Nice stalking btw. sO sAd
---
Remastering a game is not the same thing as what Classic is.
---
Starcraft just has a shiny new coat of paint on it with updated graphics, but the underlying code and systems are still the same.
---
Warcraft 3 I think has a totally new engine, but for the most part, it's the same game too.
---
what causes that meteor effect
---
Whenever you check r/classicwow just check through New and downvote unnecessary stream posts.
---
I don't think that the people playing Retail are averse to helping players out. People will still stop and assist with stuff. It's just that in Retail there's simply no reason to help the vast majority of the time. The world is trivial. In the event you do need help for a group quest there's a handy little button to click.
---
Plus people have to run so much different content they have to run just to progress. WQ's for rep gain. Island expeditions for Azerite. LFR for a chance at a 5 iLevel gear upgrade etc. Ain't no one got time for socializing.
---
That makes zero sense. If they release TBC servers, they should have to be the ones to start over. If I want to stay on Classic, when it came out before these hypothetical TBC servers, why would I be forced to restart my progression?
---
If you're getting into streaming with the goal to earn money, you're in the wrong business. It's a hell of a grind and we're talking hundreds if not thousands of hours before you are able to make anything worth mentioning, let alone make a living out of it. Sure, you can still get lucky and get to the top very quickly (see dizzy for example) but that requires being extremely talented and dedicated to what you do, and some luck too.
---
Keep in mind, to be top 1% of streamers on twitch you have to average 10 viewers, 10. You get in to streaming by liking what you do, and if you're talented at either the game or entertaining and very dedicated, or preferably all of that, you've got somewhat of a chance to make some money in a very over saturated business.  
---
And sure, if you're lucky enough and all of the above, you can make absurd amounts of money, but that's not what we're discussing. 
---
TL;DR If you start streaming with the goal to just earn money, you're an idiot.
---
Hey! Just like air, if I can‚Äôt see it I don‚Äôt believe in it. 
---
This classic game looks and plays exactly like vanilla wow did 15 years ago, therefore they must have done nothing. 
---
‚ÄúIf you do your job right, it‚Äôll look like you‚Äôve done nothing at all.‚Äù
---
Pfft only nax? I'll be level 70 by the end of 1st month
---
I was in a top end guild. Did everything up to 4hm, never was there even a discussion about engineering that I remember.
---
All are good IMO
---
I think the problem is certain private servers having faster respawn times which leads to the mobs respawning as they try to clear up the castle. Any server that‚Äôs blizzlike has 5 minute respawns and may be a lot more balanced.
---
I still use Winamp
---
Hah, no u have that backwards. The majority try to stream to make money, and the few stream with a passion. The ones passionate are usually the ones who end up making money.
---
Lol oh please, cause everyone will be rushing to cap and end game content.  How about the thousands who played on pservers for years?
---
ok
---
&gt;A dragon kited to stormwind is not really cool though
---
During beta for classic wow tho, it is actually really cool and fun. 
---
Stop being grumpy classic wow is coming bro
---
What elements of vanilla wow would you say are analogous to mobile gaming?
---
To each their own. I'm not concerned with boss fights and content from 16 years ago. Min/maxing in stuff like this just seems silly (to me), especially since the design philosophy for these fights is different from today's standards where this tiny information makes or breaks a fight.
---
Great post! I agree with almost every single thing you said, except...
---
The leveling is probly more like 55-60% of the game in Vanilla, with end-game being the other 40-45%. Just MHO. Cheers! :)
---
Not exactly thothbot but almost as good.
---
As for addons, i'm sure most popular ones will be updated. But ye there will be a bunch that'll miss for sure.
---
Wait.. 19 hrs?
---
I dont think youre suffering from memory loss. I think youre suffering  from something else called autism and mental retardation :)))
---
No idea.  Don't think they've disclosed it yet.
---
In it for the PVP. PVE was never good in wow.
---
Runescape and league
---
Or let people do what they want.
---
Ignore all these people who don't want to have a conversation about this topic; it's a tough one with no real answer that gets people riled up easily.
---
Here's the problem; WoW is about consumption.
---
Every new expansion is just a new set of challenges and environments meant to be consumed by the player. Where WoW succeeded, and why we all love Classic, is because that content was presented in a way that felt meaningful through solid RPG/social mechanics.
---
Eventually, that content runs out and we get bored. Eventually, PvP gets repetitive and we get bored.
---
Eventually, the social circle you've formed diminishes.
---
Developers could make more content, add/remove mechanics (flying, pet battles, LFD), rebalance the numbers, whatever; it doesn't fix the problem, just pushes it down the road.
---
The guiding principle *I* certainly want Blizzard to adopt is that it's the *people* playing the game that makes it fun. Give players the ability to influence and change the world, make them the driving force of the game (within reasonable limitation) and players will create a world they want to be in. In other words, make player interaction matter.
---
This could be done in a multitude of ways, ways that Blizzard has dabbled in many times. Allow players to really have warfronts where they please wherein they make camps, loaded with supplies, that they can stock and wage war with the opposing faction for territory (a la gates of AQ). Something as simple as a board in neutral towns where bounties could be placed player's heads would allow people to easily become infamous. You get the idea; let the players create the dynamic, the opposite of what Blizzard has done in BfA where everything is meant to be grinded, completed, and consumed.
---
I wonder if with the new blizzard anti-cheat stuff, if they will be able to tell who is account sharing or not, and those players will get banned?
---
I consider Rouge the official WoW spelling now. I've seen people berated in chat for saying Rogue.
---
OP clearly established a past history of playing in the top 5% of papers in later expansions as well as a willingness to learn/work toward being in the top 5% of classic players. 
---
That's a little more to go on than a vague statement about belief.
---
Mage offers the most group utility of those options, less healing necessary. I‚Äôm biased though, I mained a mage. You‚Äôre a source of AoE damage, food and beverages, crowd control (sheep), arcane intellect buff, decursing and portals home.
---
Can‚Äôt comment to warlocks, but Alt-ing a rogue, they‚Äôre exceptionally gear dependent and not as critical to group play- and since they‚Äôre on top of mobs, need considerable healing.
---
Oh yeah! I forgot DM was phase 2. As you‚Äôre leveling up be sure to let your guild  and others know that if they see a warden staff you want it. You‚Äôll be in everyone‚Äôs mind and people should be good to give it to you. Just keep your eye out for it on the AH too. 
---
Oh and also! 
---
Enchanting is good for tanking Druid‚Äôs to get smoking heart of the mountain. A BiS armor trinket. However you need like 265 enchanting. I left enchanting after that and I gotta tell you that was a freakin gold sink
---
I knew the basics of tanking when I started playing WoW. I had played a shadowknight in the watered down Playstation 2 version of Everquest back in the day (EQOA - look up gameplay videos on youtube if you're curious) so I was already familiar with the concept of tanking and holding threat. It took me a few runs of deadmines to get the hang of it. Stance dancing was a new concept to me at the time, but once I learned I could go battle stance and use mocking blow if my taunt got resisted or missed I started learning how powerful the warrior class is. In EQOA taunt was just an ability you spammed to generate threat and hold it on a mob. If you lost threat as the tank in that game you had a huge up-hill battle to get it back since there were no abilities that put you on top of the threat list. The only noob stuff I really did back then was open fights with taunt instead of using sunders/revenge out the gate. It led to situations where I actually needed to be able to pull off group-mates but taunt was on cooldown.
---
I feel like the environment design of TBC didn't take a ton of flying into account during development. Fast forward to Wrath and you can tell Northrend was designed with flying being a much larger factor than before and it worked very well. 
---
When it comes to the age-old argument of flying vs no flying, I've always been in the camp that flying is only as good as the world design. Wrath is the perfect example of the environment taking full advantage of flying.
---
I remember playing AVs in TBC and still having good, long fights with bottlenecks and even boss summons... I feel like the BG didn't really go to shit until much later in the game's life.
---
Mage and rogue will always be good for DPS and PvP, but in later tiers the mages will need to spec fire which might make pvp not so fun. There's something wrong with your raid if the mage has to hand out water to every single member.
---
As a warlock, you'd be summoning people (but def not the entire raid), handing out healthstones to the tanks, and soulstoning a healer for wipe recovery or in-combat rez. You can just replenish shards while farming a few mobs for drops.
---
It's what Blizzard did before (minus the new Vanilla servers, even though people were asking for them the day after TBC launched).
---
After ~2 years, the number of people that don't want TBC will be in the minority. Minority gets the hardship.
---
Warlocks will be more unique. So you will stand out and obtain tier easier. Also they have so much utility it‚Äôs insane so it won‚Äôt be hard to find raid groups. Their PVE spec can be used for farming/pvp and do all extremely well . Easy to level and fun aside from raiding rotation. Most classes press 2 buttons so this shouldn‚Äôt be a huge factor.  Soul shards are not bad as people say. Aside from raiding just keep a few on you at a time. All you do is cast spell before mob dies and you get a SS. Don‚Äôt listen to people who say you need to farm 40 ss before each raid they are dumb. That‚Äôs for the top end min max guilds so 90% of locks will only give health stones to tanks not the whole raid. There is no down side to playing lock besides low dps in the first raid tier.
---
Free lvl 40 mount 
---
Cheaper lvl 60 mount
---
Make a character for each class and slowly level all of them using all professions. Maybe some horde as well on a pvp server.
---
Yeah, having to swap between Prot and Arms for PvP or Fury for Pve Dps is super frustrating. Prot is worthless in Pvp and PvE dps... so I wont really have another option. 
---
I'll probably end up rolling a 2nd character semi-specifically for Pvp.
---
Actually yes, you can do emergency heals on yourself believe it or not with the right tanking spec. I speak of the HotW spec (0/30/21) where you have access to Nature's Swiftness (NS).
---
A few times now, I've had healers that fall behind or go oom and it's as simple as a Bash + NS + Max rank Healing Touch.
---
The best part is that your health you heal is more than you'd be healed in bear form since 90% health of my non-bear form may be 3900HP while that's 5800HP in bear form so when going back to bear form, it will scale to the percentage instead of the raw healing (It'll be as if you healed yourself a free 2k HP).
---
Being a Druid is about using your versatility to your advantage, hope this helps!
---
I thought for sure there would be a few ads of old friends dusting off their battle stations and even more relatable for me (a new first time father) Dads coming up with clever funny ways to play while they take care of their babies. There‚Äôs so much they could do with this I don‚Äôt see why they haven‚Äôt
---
Loool no wonder I could have swore I saw this a couple hours ago.
---
He‚Äôs in tiragarde keep in durotar waiting for the named mob for his quest to respawn, you can see in the mini map and by the quest he‚Äôs on
---
One guy on the team is.
---
Didnt work for me. Spouse got a druid up to 82 in Cata, and made a panda.. but never played since.
---
Classic i's a different game, not just another chapter in the current theme/story of the current live game. It's the "base" game of any other game - it's the play Diablo 3 in full legendaries (getting bored after some \*years\* of playing) then creating a fresh char in Diablo 2. It's playing GTA5 for 3 years, then starting fresh in GTA3 - it feels fantastic, because it's different and way more "directly connected to the game" when you're significantly weak and everything is harder around you and the world and everything feels as if you know it since a lifetime.
---
Anything Blizz will do on the live game won't make you feel the same as the old game, if **you don't enjoy it anymore** \- once you've seen several expansions, defeated millions of villains and conquered the most badass worlds, anything they do at this point (even if it's a masterpiece, work of art etc) will feel pretty much garbage/boring/same-thing-with-different-colors/recycled/not-fun and so on. Once you buy 10 cars over your lifetime, even tho they're all nicer looking than previous one, more comfortable, more powerful and with significantly more tech in them, you will \*always\* have the most fun, by far, in your first car - it touches your feelings, it's simpler and you feel connected way more with the car.
---
It's ok to not like the game, maybe you should quit (for a while or better, for good). Never forget the base rule in gaming - you should never play a game if you no longer consider it's fun for you to play it.
---
I personally doubt you will play Classic for 5 years, that's not a sustainable, long-term/years-long game if you ask me. I am as excited about Classic as many other players, during the stress test I've looked and observed in details at every place and object in Elwynn Forest. I've taken more than 200 screenshots of which dozens in every spot of StormWind and I've compared them to the ones I took throughout 2006. I am so looking forward to playing it! However, I am not looking forward to explore SW anymore in the stress test, it's no longer exciting after I've throughoughly inspected it, at this point it already feels as repetitive and non-exciting as everything in the live game. I do like the old SW way more than the current/post-Cata SW, but even then, I'm already no longer excited about SW itself. Probably the entire game (Classic) will have the same fate of becoming non-exciting after a while (especially since I already went through all the insane grinding and raids farming in 2006), but currently I'm so looking forward for release!
---
a trinket from AQ40 trash mobs. During the time of this video it's damage was affected with spell power. I fear with classic it no longer will be affected with spell power.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21891/shard-of-the-fallen-star
---
Edit: Forgot the link to the trinket.
---
They will roll these classes first... but most people will reroll when they find out shamans are slow, warlocks need gear to do well, warriors are hard, and when the salt builds up from rogues constantly ganking them, they reroll rogue.
---
I don't feel bad for anyone that voluntarily takes part in an activity. I personally ignore streamers as if I am watching a game related video I am usually looking for information as opposed to entertainment. An exception to this might be like a good background on lore. I do think streamers getting items and gold gifted to them does kind of ruin the spirit of the game a tad but I am honestly not informed enough on the matter to make that an absolute statement. Anything I know about streamers is random crap I read here and unfortunately my recommended WoW videos are filled with them.
---
I know. As a kid I even started questioning if it was wrong, when I PLAYED Rogue lol
---
Dual spec
---
Just because YOU will get bored quickly doesn‚Äôt mean everyone will. Private server success is proof that many people love vanilla wow and will gladly do all sorts of grinding and farming because they enjoy it. They like that they can set a goal (that isn‚Äôt ilvl or a specific trinket) and farm/grind for it over a period of time. They enjoy finally getting the reward they‚Äôve put in hours/days (sometimes weeks).
---
Well put.
---
Deciding which activities are worth doing is the best part of the game. Not sure why difference in priorities creates such a backlash in the community. 
---
"Enjoy the game the way it was intended", pfft. Just enjoy it.
---
Me and my IRL friend were both glad during season 2. Not lying at all.
---
The fact people had to explain what odds and even were made me cringe every time.
---
pvp also sucked compared to tbc or wrath
---
The guy is speaking the truth and y'all are getting butthurt. üòÇ The lvling, wpvp, community and even farming bis is more fun then MC and ONL. They're super easy and boring. Once BWL drops shit gets more interesting.
---
Ive just been nurturing a dormant Mount and Blade addiction in the meantime.
---
This is what people aren't getting... Same content for 2 years is a stretch. Huge stretch. Nothing releasing, nothing changing.
---
I think it's gonna be a ghost town within a year unfortunately
---
I'll be testing on my partners laptop for the next stress test. See how something basic works.
---
Mage for ranged dps and rogue for melee, and warlock if you want to be a special snowflake
---
Why tho?
---
Because the meta has shifted that everyone used Druid flag carrier, so you countered that as hard as you could, as did your opponents.  In an effort to try and out smart them you bring your best Prot warrior for even more survivability and when that works the opposition counters.
---
Have you checked out Witcher 3?
---
Not every streamer has their Discord people blaring over themselves they have it more or less muted on their stream until something important is happening. Sodas group of discord people aren't yelling over each other in discord when im watching Sodas stream.
---
Your hybrid Druid pvp feral/resto sounds perfect for my needs, any chance of a build link please?
---
People would share accounts to have access to their bank alts.  Blizz kind of turned a blind eye to that back in the day, but there is no way I see them doing so now.
---
Despite what all the "try hards" tell you, unless you're actively gimping yourself in talents pretty much everything is viable. as long as you can carry your weight you'll always find a guild that will want you therethe only problem are the sets pigeon hole you into healing  because they have no set bonuses for damage on druids/Shamans/Paladins Tier sets.
---
Thats one thing i hope they do if they go the OSRS route and create new content for it is better itemization for sets (the token system from WotLK would be amazing for it) and less fights requiring 8 tanks unless they give us more options for tanks in those situations
---
I played Rogue during vanilla beta and its initial release but I think this video made me roll a Mage as my main not long after.
---
In Classic WoW I am still deciding on Mage or Rogue.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqeQXkrherQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqeQXkrherQ)
---
I'm mostly talking about pugs, which will be what 99% of players end up in. Even in this post naxx geared premade group you're describing 2 years down the line,  hunters are still mandatory for viper sting alone. Killing Paladins isn't the issue, no class in the game can do that. High level PVP is about mana control.
---
[https://raiders-tavern.com/nostalrius-survey-analysis-201606/](https://raiders-tavern.com/nostalrius-survey-analysis-201606/) has some information that might be interesting for this including two bits
---
 80% did play Burning Crusade on official servers, 85% did play Wrath of the Lich King. Only 68% did play Vanilla on retail 
---
The second part is what was interesting as in for every three people two didn't play vanilla but played nostalrius.
---
 Most players were between 20 to 24 years old. Lots of them¬†did not play Vanilla WoW on launch back in 2004 
---
This to is interesting because their ages were in the single digits and still played the "vanilla" wow.
---
I just think this shows its not just nostalgia but also the game itself drawing people in.
---
That said nostalgia is a part just not the only part.
---
Kind of in your boat. I haven't played since wrath, (a little WOD but got burned out in like a week), but yes. Sometimes I get the feeling when I /w someone they are like, "who the fuck is guy and why is he talking to me, weirdo". When back in classic, it was almost standard to group with people in the same quest area and talk to one another.
---
Imagine looking at this unironically as if it's a good thing. There legit are people who want this.
---
And there was something entirely magical, going into a raid dungeon and hoping 1) something from your tiered set would drop, 2) it wasn‚Äôt a piece you already owned, and 3) that feeling when you got it( or didn‚Äôt...). That anticipation was everything. I look forward to that again.
---
it's the influence from retail.
---
modern mythic raiding is soo friggin hard and tightly tuned people will go to extreme length just to get 1% more dps or healing... 
---
Compare that with Molten core where half your raid can be mouth breathing , keyboard-turning clickers and you'll still do just fine.
---
old habits die hard.
---
Someone will correct me if i'm wrong I'm sure, but from what I know:
---
1) Set 1 (tier 0) should be available since they are drops in dungeons that are available. I'm not sure if the quest for Set 2 (tier 0.5) will be available right away, but it'll take you some time to farm Set 1 anyway.
---
2) Most dungeons will be 5 man with the exception of UBRS being 10 man  (not sure if LBRS is also 10 man).
---
3) I think the limit is 5 runs/resets in the same dungeon per hour.
---
Character development and choices mattering? What are you, some kind of RPG fan?
---
I don't want to take too long leveling but I'm going to keep all my professions maxed out as much as I can. Including fishing
---
In terms of level of be happy at 45 after 30 days. I just want to have cleared MC atleast once before phase 2.
---
No way. Part of the experience was having to GO TO an enchanter for your enchants.
---
It's not a huge deal but it's one of those other little things that encouraged player character interaction even more.
---
I'm trying not to be too hardcore this time around. Ya know?
---
There is no ‚Äútruth‚Äù. You can‚Äôt tell people what they enjoy, it all is opinionated.
---
Do I need to be subbed for a stress test invite?
---
I'm happy to tell you that windfury had been nerfed and 2h enhancement is laughably bad in 1.12.
---
They ruined the game continuously over about a decade. The old team needs to come back and show them how it's done. 
---
The highest rated post on /r/WoW right now:

[I just want BFA to be over at this point](https://reddit.com/r/wow/comments/btp9my/i_just_want_bfa_to_be_over_at_this_point/)
---
1. What you call dungeon set 0 will be available. The upgraded set will not be before very late.
---
2. It was changed around a couple of times, I don't think we have heard specifics yet, but most likely it will be 5man normally and 10man for ubrs/lbrs
---
3. You can have up to 5 dungeon ID's at once, and each ID resets after 1 hour.
---
I don't have beta to test it and also it is 30 capped so it is not testable. But I have evidence I pointed out. And you mentioned not being full leather now. Sonia leather better or not? Don't think this is how it works. 
---
I played and leveled a tank paladin during TBC and I assure you the armor diff is significant. 1-3 pieces of leather is ok if it is below level 40 so it is vs mail. But no way vs plate. The difference is huge and level 50 bosses shred through you.
---
Yeah, but I‚Äôd rather believe that one cynical redditor, I think.
---
"I'm going to make a post on the classic subreddit, trying to shit on something everyone else wants to enjoy, because I want to be edgy and different."
---
I strike a nerve? I've made no claim other than saying you sounded like people who said Classic was never going to happen.
---
Yea it's seems amazing and worthy of it's accolades but, for some reason I can't get into it. Not a mark against it though. It looks like a 10/10 to me. Feel the same about RD2.
---
that's when you found out half your MC raid was AFK during trash and doing nothing but auto-attack during boss?
---
He's not speaking truth, he's telling people how to play the game based on his opinion. More than that, his target audience, people planning to speed rush, know exactly what they're getting into. They don't need someone telling them what the game will be like, they know what it will be like. If they choose to rush to 60 and get to endgame it's because that's what they like. Who is he, or you, to tell them otherwise?
---
Ah I c
---
I mean, it is a little bit sexist
---
&gt; regarding this, blizzard just said "you need to trust us on this" without providing any evidence.
---
TIL side by side video comparisons aren't evidence.
---
&gt; entrances to instances were guarded by elites.
---
Some were, some weren't. There still are outside most, and I'd be willing to bet the mobs inside the ST entrance are still elite. 
---
&gt; also many that played the game back then are remembering that mobs where a lot harder in instances at least.
---
No one remembers the amount of damage they took 15 years ago. Also, people keep saying they remember it differently, and you pointed out how there are no patch notes, why not some actual evidence of your claim? You demand evidence from patch notes, but provide none for your own claims.
---
Even then, when things were changed, or the fact that they were changed, doesn't matter as long as it was on or before 1.12. What matters is how it was at 1.12. You could pick apart each patch and pick and choose what you wanted to keep or leave, but that's why they just went with 1.12, no questions. 
---
&gt; tanks where not supposed to survive getting pounded by 3-4 elites while in battle stance with 2h and deathwish on like this. in vanilla this would've meant almost instant death.
---
They also have WW axe and probably the best gear they can possibly have in every slot, it's not the same as leveling through that content normally.
---
&gt; that also points out that defensive stance and 1h + shield is obsolete at level 30 which leads to what? a design flaw? why make shields for that lvl if there is no need for them?! whats the point in damage reduction defensive stance?!
---
Higher level content that you aren't absolutely max geared for... obviously...
---
&gt; they did the same with AV, providing the nerfed version that was live for a short while at the end of vanilla. they are actually removing the grind and the hardships. the only unbearable thing now left is the grand marshal grind. they are providing the nerfed version of vanilla because a lot of ppl expressed concern that they not have time for wow like they did 15 years ago. this is understandable even though you dont actually need to do all the content but dont push the "vanilla was hard" narrative when you're not gonna make it like that anymore.
---
They are providing the final version of Vanilla. No matter what they did, there would be people like you who would bitch and moan about one thing being in X patch and not Y, or vice-versa, and they would catch shit no matter which features they chose to put into Classic. Which is why they went with flat 1.12. If you don't like WoW as it was in 1.12, don't play. It wasn't that much different though. 
---
Don't forget that people know way more about the game now as well, which is part of the 'It's easier than I remember' argument.
---
I don‚Äôt see why it would need to be limited. Aren‚Äôt tabs like 5k gold which in vanilla is an assload of investment.
---
Idk I've been clearing endgame for 4 years and I still enjoy it.
---
I mean, that goes both ways right? Some people like it the way it, why ruin it for one party so the other can have it their way?
---
It‚Äôs a private server...
---
People that were on the previous stress test are the ones that will be in this one so if you weren't invited to that one, you are very unlikely to be in this one and yes it requires an active sub, but you don't have to be playing BFA just be subbed.
---
&gt; It was 8 and then increased to 16 in 1.7. In 1.11 debuffs gained their priority system. 
---
Were not talking about actual retail with these 8, 12, and 16 numbers. 
---
&gt; The post is a really cursory analysis and not that accurate. e.g. the poster writing off Gift of Arthas, concluding that you wouldn't get 38.5 physical attacks off in 3 seconds (or really 12.5 hits per second). 
---
"Right now one tick of corruption does something in the neighborhood of 300 damage/3 seconds, assuming you're SM/ruin spec, you're flasked, and you're getting shadow vulnerability. That 300 is a bit misleading because it doesn't include the damage from the instant shadowbolts that the corruption might create, but lets ignore that. With this napkin math, you would need to average \~38 *successful* melee strikes in 3 seconds *just to match* corruption. Not just 38 attacks, but 38 attacks that land.  
---
I don't think you're going to exceed 38 melee strikes / 3 seconds, except in very unusual circumstances ie. stacking dagger rogues, using hunter pets, melee heavy raids. In those unique circumstances, Gift of Arthas would beat corruption and it would be worth applying. If your raid has 5 hunter pets biting at the heels of bosses, by all means.   
---
For everyone else, steer clear of Arthas, especially as we move towards ZG, AQ40, and Naxx. The two are somewhat comparable now, but that's quite temporary. When warlocks get more gear, corruption continues to scale up, and gift of arthas continues to provide the static 8. At the same time, hunters and their pets become less viable, and less present in raids."
---
MUCH less cursory than your maths... and she even left out nightfall procs to make it lean towards melee...
---
The debuffs i find useless in raid are such: CoW, Faerie Fire, Demoralizing Shout, the amount of incoming dmg you reduce is far below the dps you can achieve with these. If you are using them its a waste of your mana/rage
---
That is a strange but unique setup friend
---
Wtf are those hotkeys
---
People wont like what I don't like. Fact.
---
Thats good enough man! Dont gate keep her as a gamer, if she plays mario party, shes cool with gaming in general. Establish a boundary and tell her about it.  Spouse and I's second date was getting WOTLK at midnight release. I lead a raid team and Liz played Animal Crossing on my game cube.
---
Don't forget the scroll vendor in SW!
---
reading comments it was effected by spell power during vanilla so it should be in classic
---
ive seen other videos where paladins use fire proc items because sp effects them , including some axe
---
Even stupider then
---
Imagine living inside a bubble and not understanding that pservers have existed for years and people actually enjoy end game
---
I'm not sure if there's a clean solution. 
---
I'm guessing you can just use some clever VPN tricks to make it look like it's the same person at the same location, just with different devices.
---
It would discourage blatant account-sharing but it would still be possible, so all the aspiring R14's would still just do that anyway.
---
The only *clean* solution would be xrealm rBGS matching premades together during a primetime window. Then R14's would be actually skill-based instead of time-based. But that won't happen, vanilla is (sadly) more about putting in time and gear grinding than improving your own skill level.
---
shortcut to recycle bin, without a shortcut arrow... porn folder?
---
Armor not being linear is skmething you also forgot. And tou can easily test it out on a paerver, for that they should be fairly accurate.
---
Compring 2 different classes on 2 different eras just invalidates you right now.
---
Dont be a fat guy.
---
Livers are life...level that cooking bruh.
---
1. The blue dungeon sets will be available at launch, the upgrade quests to make them epic won't be available until Phase 5 (AQ).
---
2. BRD, Dire Maul, Stratholme, and Scholomance are 5-man only. Every other dungeon can be 10-manned, but you can only complete quests in 5-man (with the exception of UBRS).
---
3. If there's no one inside your instance, you can right-click your portrait and "Reset All Instances". You can only do this 5 times per hour.
---
If you play a warrior and you've got a hpala next to you, he can literally cast blessing of freedom on you and you will wreck everything. I mean everything.  
---
Solo is a different matter. Warrior is a super fun challenge and with engineering and other items you can really outplay even the hardest classes for you (frost mages), a good warrior to watch and get inspired by is monkeynews (youtube it, great clips). Beating a good frost mage will require patience, good gear (survivability) and sometimes consumables (free action potion, skull of impending doom, tidal charm, health pot/root tubers are some of the items that will help you massively). But its hard, dont get me wrong.  
---
Locks and mages are both great options. Kind of boring in PvE compared to warrior in my opinion, but both really shine in PvP, especially in 1v1s, but also in a premade setting.  
---
Farming gold will for sure be easiest with the mage due to AoE farming, and respecs wont be as big of a problem. If you don't want to keep farming gold for respecs warlock is the best option, as their PvE spec is totally viable in PvP too.
---
Don't really get the point of this post.  Nobody is saying that you can't find friends or community in retail.  But it's pretty clear how classic *fosters* community interaction.
---
Point being, the community was much more prevalent in Vanilla because the game and world encouraged people to group up and help one another.  In retail, it's easier to just queue for quest/dungeon/raid, phase in, kill boss, leave party.
---
Never knew his story :\ Maybe he'll come back for classic and we can rekindle old rivalries. I have this highly unrealistic thought that they'll recreate at least some of the original launch servers and people will gravitate to their old haunts and it'll be one big happy reunion, but I guess we'll see how it goes :p
---
[Link for the lazy if you‚Äôre confused](https://youtu.be/ja1j7xWpB3w)
---
Your proposal is pretty much the assumed format for how classic will go if blizzard decides not to roll out Bc or new content. 
---
They‚Äôve said they are committed to classic long term. That pretty much implies server resets like diablo, which has been relegating old ladder character to the non ladder realm for nearing 20 years now.
---
No way, Slyv needs to keep the Nelf bounce!
---
Not only are they decked when it comes to raid gear which no one else has a use for, they are decked before that.
---
Druids level fast. Amazingly fast. They drag until they get catform, and then it's a blast. They are consistently among the first to reach cap, and when they do, THEY ARE THE ONLY AVAILABLE TANKS, because warriors are lagging behind.
---
So they tank, and when the warris hit 60, the druids are already in full pre-raid gear :P
---
He's downloading at 3Mbps, ie megabits per second, not megabyte. Less than half of todays average. Still not bad for 2004.
---
Who the f struggles on any boss in MC, lol? You could do a 40 man druid raid with boomkins, resto and feral druids and clear MC in a weekend with full blue gear.
---
I mean every class needs good gear to compete at the level u are talking about. By good gear, you're going to need either R14, which takes a SHIT ton of constant play, or some good PvE gear as well. Both take time.
---
If u don't have much time, u might want to curb your expectations and play what you enjoy. There's no arena, only ranking system goes by basically how much u play, so there will be no way for you to be "competitive" if you don't play 12 hours a day
---
back in the days, tanks and healer were considered gods in raid while the DPS was mere trash lucky enough to be in their presence.
---
The tank never sucked... it was the DPS fault for overaggroing.
---
the tank was never slow to pick up mob.. it was the DPS fault for being out of position.
---
the healer wasn't responsible to heal DPS... ever ( i'd say those guild had a big surprise on Vael... but they probably didn't make it to Vael).
---
DPS meters were a big no-no... kind of like with LFR nowadays ; the one at the top is considered an elitist jerk and people hate him.
---
You even had guild giving tanks and healer loot priority.
---
pretty much the opposite of retail.
---
They are all getting a lot of views and subs. No need to feel sorry for them.
---
Yeah, you realize the old team is the team that introduced stuff like flying mounts, daily quests, and LFD queues right?
---
Do you mean balanced? Instead of OP?
---
Badly phrased on my part.
---
Arena was an ATTEMPT at making it esporty, and, as you point out correctly, an extremely bad one.
---
I really wish I saved screenshots from 2004-5. That is quite a few PC builds ago and I didn't really make a habit of saving images. :(
---
Of course ill definitely have a ‚Äúmain‚Äù and an alt ill prioritize more... itll just take me probably 3-4 months till theyre max.  Im not interested in serious raiding so ill mostly just be leveling/pvp with some friends
---
UBRS and LBRS are in the same instance portal so their player limit will be the same.
---
Nature resist is brutal in most raid encounters .  it does not benefit from curse of eles either.  Tbc onward your type of damage really didn't matter.
---
I'd like to see video footage from 2006/7 but I've struggled to find any. 
---
I know they have an internal vanilla build and have some comparisons where the numbers are in line. I also appreciate greatly the efforts the devs have gone to in these comparisons. It's possible this build was compiled using some of the adjustments such as the higher player damage and lower mob damage.
---
I felt the same on my Shaman, Hunter and Priest. People are quite negative over there.
---
I'm playing Auto Chess and looking forward to the new PoE league so I'm set game wise until classic
---
Spec into wand spec, pull with fire blast and wand away
---
Go to moo\_UK stream, ask him to open his bags. Ask him how he got em.
---
Again, im not theory crafting here. Its a working way to get stuff (bags and pots in this case)
---
Of course it's not just 1 thing. No reason to make a game if there is no player base. The comment I replying to was
---
&gt;Caving to qq of a few players is why we are getting classic servers though
---
This suggests that primary reason this game is being released is because people posted on some forums. Not true. All these games already have a player base - anyone who purchased these games before, liked them, and still games occasionally. You rerelease a great, older game, update it, make it pretty and compatible and you will automatically have a large amount of people ready to buy your product. Congratulations, you've now done a little bit of work (relative to making a new game) for a lot of money. There are several companies out there doing the same thing with old titles. This is a simple way to make money without developing a new game. I don't know how to make it any more clear that this is a business strategy.
---
Dwarf, otherwise you should not play priest
---
Dwarf is unquestionably better for everything, except your eyes. If aesthetics matter, we can‚Äôt help you. Racials nor priest specific racials are a big enough game changer to matter outside of say the servers preeminent premade pvp group and the speed running guild.
---
Yeah I read some of your posts and replies and I really think you‚Äôd enjoy shaman. The mobility is best in game from 20-40 as you pick up ghost wolf there get 40% increased movement speed. Through enhancement tree you can reduce cast to instant speed, though I probably wouldn‚Äôt blow the talents on just that as there are some other helpful talents early. That 3sec cast puts you ahead of hunters and druids in move speed, which is a big deal until you get mounts and even then it‚Äôs only better to mount up if it will take more than 17sec to get where you‚Äôre going. Takes some pressure off farming the gold for mount.
---
Yes, it was a mechanic implemented back then to help deal with lag and reduce stress on servers.
---
Just like.... you guessed it: Spell batching. That people wanted back because it was back in vanilla.
---
it was easy before patch 1.11...
---
thinking about how my guild wiped on barron geddon back in the day... i'm not sure they'd be able to do LFR today.
---
I also pulled a lot of raids as a hunter. It's very convenient to pop Cheetah, shoot the baddie, and pull it right to the tank.
---
Haha exactly. I remember the guild i joined had a ‚Äúno kids allowed‚Äù bs rule. I was able to join and just always used the ‚Äúdont have a mic‚Äù excuse for vent
---
I'd take a 10 year old over a bitchy 26 year old every day of the week. üòä
---
Starcraft Broodwar, you‚Äôre Our Guy
---
More like, you don't like AV the way it was originally designed?  Don't spoil it for those who do when you have other options available.
---
If they don't raise the cap then it was useful the entire time you were on the character.
---
You can't use the same argument for both eventualities. That's not how arguments work.
---
Instead of that, we'll get auto dismount when touching water.
---
i had to make my own server just to double check my character with the tier sets lol
---
I hope in the future they have servers dedicated for different versions of the game. Retail, Vanilla, in a few years TBC, and "Classic". Classic being, like you said, new content but with the classic themes in mind.
---
Very weird of you to speak on behalf of every classic wow streamer - I wonder if any of them have different opinions then you and actually enjoy streaming the game? Seems likely that's the case
---
Alliance RFC raid bois
---
Rather cringe than wipe
---
And even after youve cleared AQ and get bis , youd have played for more than a year already. How was that not worth the investment?
---
Both are super fun. But man, I love me some pom pyro mages.
---
It serves the same purpose regardless of the method used. Rerelease  an older, popular game to cash in on past success. Little bit of effort, big pay off.
---
The game hasn't launched. It's in beta.
---
You're putting the cart before the horse.
---
The hostility comes on the back of hundreds of these threads. Yours isn't special. It will be as pointless as the hundreds before it.
---
Phase 5 is a long way off. I guess it gives you time to gather the materials for the quest so that when it comes you just go do it.
---
You can 10 man Scarlet Monastery? Why did Asmondgold and the others just do it 5 man? :(
---
i like westfall personally-- theyre all grindy quests so i just throw on netflix on my 2nd monitor and autopilot. way better than the vast, bleak nothingness of the barrens imo
---
When trying out the stresstest i found the performance to be way better than expected. In dun morogh my fps was hovering between 4-500 on graphic setting 8 when i tried to uncap it. Yes, I do have a good rig but all I'm saying is that you won't need a monster PC to run it on decent settings. Im running a i5 [8600@5.2GHz](mailto:8600@5.2GHz) and GTX 1080 with 16GB of ram.
---
Second hand prices tend to be really good fps per $, if you aim to buy a used rig id look at something like a i7 4790k and a GTX 970/1060/1070, depending on where you live ofc but it should be pretty cheap. You can find this in Sweden for around $500-$600 and it would definitely run classic well, with some performance to spare.  
---
The 4790k is definitely one of the best fps per $ when it comes to gaming performance, even today. Over here its not uncommon to find a motherboard, 16GB DDR3 ram and a 4790k for $250, people tend to sell it as a kit when they upgrade to a new cpu. Throw in a GPU, PSU, HDD and a cheap case and you're good to go.  
---
If you're buying new, I'd go for a ryzen 2600 (or similar price range) and a GTX 1660 with 16GB of ram, but thats going to give you somewhat similar performance in game for a way higher price. Gaming on a budget = used rig, atleast in my eyes.
---
And a casual officer will give that raid spot to the person trying to down bosses, no matter what spec. Rather than giving it to some semi-afk DPS warrior that doesn't care shit about anything and /follow on trash and halfwit his dmg on bosses.
---
I first saw this video when it was new in 05/06, but only just recently discovered that it took place on my server. (Frostmane US).
---
Sat down with my wife, who also played at the time, and went through every kill, recognized about a third of the victims, including a member of our guild.  I don't have any video of that time, only screens, so it was very weird seeing them in motion again, if only for a few seconds before their deaths.
---
go on /r/wowservers
---
Bro, you were 9. You keep saying stuff like  
---
\&gt;  Imagine a world where you leveled up to 60 Conquered Naxx, then AQ 
---
AQ was before Naxx.
---
You have literally no idea wtf you are talking about.
---
What comes next is irrelevant. If people say it enough, and Blizz decides do try to do something like "Classic+" that's fine, but it will be separate from Classic. To this day, EQ1 is opening new progression servers every few months and they get hundreds if not thousands of people on them every time. There is even one that is locked relatively early on in the expansion progression and it has a healthy population.
---
Actually I do. Just not in Classic.
---
And I‚Äôll add this, I think flying in TBC and WotLK wasn‚Äôt totally awful. Yes, it did destroy world PvP and made things feel smaller, but just think about how cool Storm Peaks and Icecrown were. I really liked those zones.
---
That said, I absolutely understand the counter argument, and agree with it when it comes to world PvP. When you can just mount up and ignore everybody, that eliminates it in its previous form.
---
You keep comparing this to spell batching. This isn't spell batching. This doesn't do anything in a caster vs caster fight. It doesn't have a presence in every PvP encounter like spell batching does. 
---
It existed. It's probably going to exists. I won't argue that at all, but this isn't spell batching's younger brother leeway Jenkins. Most people are going to assume they are lagging like crazy, and this has vastly different results from one fight to the next. Spellbatching is at least recognizable as the way spells function.
---
It's not an alternative because they don't share cooldowns.
---
That's only 5% true. The large majority of those things were added by people who came well after Classic was released, and Expansions had entire new teams of people.
---
What do you mean weapon skills? Like classes know all their relevant weapon type skills by default?
---
A Feral tank can pre-hot before the pull and top off the group after the pull while the healer is drinking.
---
Using Rebirth can prevent a wipe or save the group from a long run back (especially in long dungeons like Dead Strat, Scholo, BRD, UBRS).
---
It's a lateral difference compared to what Warriors provide, but it does matter in the argument of viability in tanking dungeons since these can be major time savers.
---
Gods he was the strongest back then!!
---
I donno why you get downvotes, it's a reasonable question.
---
I will play a Tauren Shaman in Classic.
---
To make a long story short. I like to heal. It's fun to buff a grp with windfury and other totems. Shamans are also cool looking and in pvp we are a cool BURST/purge/windfury/heal hybrid and that's fun. And yea we will use the ugly turquoise dress at first but later the Shaman bis gear will be awesome looking tier gear!
---
Oh I just saw I missed an invite to beta a week ago. Time to join in
---
Total war three kingdoms. So good. Just came out.
---
after trying a private server a couple weeks ago, i think i might wait a week or two before starting on classic. there were quests that actually took an hour just because it was a race to tag a certain mob first before the other 50 people standing around trying to as well.
---
I know that premades were one of the most hated things on the forums back in the day.  They eventually removed the ability to queue for bgs in a raid group, so only 5-man parties could do it; but like everything else, there was backlash on that decision as well.
---
I would suggest that premades had a preference to be queued against other premades at all times, but unless there are ton of them, queues would take forever.
---
It's really a slippery slope when it comes to what people enjoy vs what is best for balance and the rest of the playerbase.
---
&gt; It's possible this build was compiled using some of the adjustments such as the higher player damage and lower mob damage.
---
Dude. No. it isn't.
---
They have the actual database from vanilla. They literally just have to drop in the tables for stats man. They have the ORIGINAL vanilla client running internally to compare against. Literally the original data. Far better than a video.
---
The damage is identical. The entire community had your exact thoughts a couple of weeks ago. it has been debunked. Thoroughly.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291845/elite-npc-damage-is-not-way-off-in-classic-wow-blizzard-reply
---
Your perception is based on your skill level difference and/or simply mis-remembering the events of the time. Memories are notoriously biased.
---
You do need sub to get it but its kinda too late for getting access anymore.
---
Can anyone spare some adderall?
---
Thanks, wasn't sure about LBRS.
---
I'm aware.
---
As many as they can / as many want the spot. (many would, just for the nostalgia and $ alone). should be invited back to make the game what it was. 
---
The people that made BFA need to be named, shamed, and banned from fucking up the game any more.
---
&gt;Even if there's no API access, you can easily scrape the page the same way that we did in 2004.
---
An Armory scraper would have to go through RIDICULOUS amounts of requests to be even remotely reliable.
---
The amount of data isn't the problem. The problem is the number of queries. It would never be up to date to any standard that would make it halfway useful. The thing that made raider.io possible, was the fact that you could very easily get the numbers via the Mythic+ score API...and that was only because it tracked only the top percentiles anyway.
---
So no, an Armory scraper won't be a thing. Wasn't back then either, even though it's technically easy enough to implement.
---
&gt;could just be gathered locally by an addon, with some history tracking
---
What's the point of that?
---
Player inspection is a thing in classic anyway. If I have to inspect someone to keep my "score" of him up to date, then the Addon is useless, or rather, what it does is redundant. I make an UBRS group. You wanna join. I tell you to come to the bridge for inspection. I can SEE your gear, I don't need an addon to tell me what gear you had last week.
---
And what's more, once I KNOW you, and have done a run with you, I will invite you again if you were decent and didn't behave like an arsehole. The fact that I know you outweighs any gear considerations.
---
Something people forget, is that Classic Servers are CLOSED COMMUNITIES. The reason why raider.io and similar crap was ever used, is because Retail reduces your fellow players to faceless bots.
---
Well the fact is we're getting the 1.12 version, which is a PvE race, so this was all hypothetical to say the least. I expect the goal-oriented people will get their unstoppable forces on the first AV weekend after its release.
---
I'd argue ret was decent enough to be accepted, because it brought acceptable DPS (More than they did in Vanilla, where Warriors and Rogues are doing about twice the DPS), while also providing unique buffs holy/prot paladins didn't. My point is that it's viable and generally accepted.
---
The raid benefits more from giving it to a fury warrior, because they now have someone else who can be a great tank if needed. 
---
As far as the player goes, probably the rogue because they can dump threat.
---
I think it'd be sick of they took things like Guild wars into WoW. Declaring war on another guild, being able to kill them on sight (same faction). It would cause a LOT of huge guild fights. It starts off as 1 member gets ganked, he tells his guild and they come, next thing you know it's 50v50.
---
At least they aren't doing what Disney is doing:  re-releasing all their old IPs as "live action" so they don't enter the public domain.
---
You gonna be disappointed because people wont agree with you.
---
That‚Äôs next level UI for vanilla.
---
I'm thinking maybe he's not a native English speaker and doesn't understand the phrasing. Or a troll. Shrug.
---
lmao, what? Engineering isn't required at all.
---
Sorry I'm not sure what the intention was with this comment the English died very fast
---
LFG :)
---
And it would give Alliance 2 viable tanks while Horde only have 1. 
---
What you don't seem to understand is that people want classic *because* those specs are unusable in PVE. And some of those specs are good for PVP. Not everyone gets to be good at everything.
---
yikes making fun of someone and then calling them defensive when they say they weren't claiming to be the best *emoji because I'm eleven fucking years old*
---
"R u tanking the bitch"
---
Accurate whisper is accurate.
---
No shit dude, I want to quit my life for a month and just play. Too bad I'm old now and can't do that :(
---
\- NA  
---
\- PVP
---
\-Alliance
---
\- I am debating between a Mage, or Warrior. I have played the game and raided endgame from Vanilla til now
---
\- Raids on the weekend only. Friday after 8 PM MST. Saturday and Sunday anytime.
---
\- I want to play in a guild that wants to push content but at the same time remembers this just a game. Hard to explain but I do not want to pressure people into playing a style they hate or raging or kicking people out cause they had to go to work. Also I prefer a group that is a little older. Maybe above 25 at the least. I am 30 and just feel better playing with a mature group.
---
I work a full time job as most of you do. But I also work a side job at home which allows me to play WoW and make money at the same time almost every evening and all weekend. As I result I am online  ALOT. But while I work I wont be very talkative. Just doing mindless stuff like farming and what not. I hope a guild is okay with this playing style. I can always stop my work for a few hours for a dungeon or raid. 
---
Send me a PM.
---
Min maxers are not screwing themselves over because the gear is the same. 90% of the good items that drop are also good for the bad specs. Only shitcan guilds misusing DKP let decent upgrades get DE'd instead of used because they're not BiS.
---
The gamers are just as much at fault. A lot if what they implemented was asked for or driven by the industry in general.
---
Also pretty unrealistic to ask for the old team. Older members might have retired. Others moved on to higher positions, other companies, other industries. 
---
I've been on the same software product for 12 years. Across all teams on the project I think there's me, one other dev, and 3 business analysts from that time. Then there's a set of folks about 6-7 years in, and another set about 2 years in.
---
... my point, be glad there is even one dev still around. He's the golden goose. :)
---
Warrior with a elemental shaman buddy really feels more like a windfury wielder than an enhancer.
---
On average a warrior will probably proc more windfury swings than an enhancer.
---
Enhancer: autoswing and stormstrike
---
warrior: cleave, mortal strike, hamstring, execute, bloodthirst, revenge, whirlwind, heroic strike, sword proc, overpower, sweeping strikes extra hits, slam, pummel (?), mocking blow and retaliation.
---
If that‚Äôs what your microwave looks like, you have issues. Wipe the fucker down once in a while.
---
They could fix this by offering a kind of shuttle service that makes sense in the game world. Like a mini flight path where you can pick your landing zone in the vicinity of the destination.
---
Something wrong with ^ medulla oblongata.
---
UI addons started to get really advanced at the end of vanilla (I imagine the complexity of Naxx had something to do with it).
---
By TBC, you could almost mistake a player's UI for modern wow.
---
yikes thinking that‚Äôs making fun of someone ü§£
---
If you AH the greens that drop as you level you should have more than enough for mount training when you hit 40
---
That's it. I asked you not to reply to me. Omw rn, your done kid.
---
Edit: YOU'RE*
---
I think it might have been on EU. I recall the guild name.
---
I still clicked and KB turned into Sunwell...
---
&gt;People in Vanilla didn't worry so much about min/max. Just played the game and chilled.
---
It'll be quite different this time around, no doubt.
---
That's precisely the point. Not every aspect of the game needs to be tailored to people who don't play it often. The difficulty does not need to scale with your new schedule.
---
Truly the only way to atone for clicking invite vs inspect....
---
For me it's going to be swapping adderall for pot, soda for coffee, water, and beer, and replace the microwave with grubhub orders from my favorite dim sum restaurant.
---
Just make sure Grid and bartender works.
---
So is everything if you look at it WANTING to find something sexist.
---
Back in the early 2000s people were ALOT more relaxed, and we all had a better time because of it.
---
nooooice
---
It's not just WoW, it's all of Activision. Every game of theirs is suffering, all of it is because of atrocious management. If the Classic team is a new one with sane management, and this seems to be the case, then it will do just fine.
---
It‚Äôs really not that bad. Warrior is not hard to level at all on Beta, it‚Äôs probably not even in the bottom 2 classes for speed. Health regen is about 3x what people are used to on PS with tbc core. You can tank any dungeon and be #3+ off tank for any raid completely fine without any points in prot. Progression content is going to very short and sweet for most guilds, 3-4 weeks max, so after that any guild not speed running will be fine with you raiding in pvp spec.
---
Tell that to elementals healing for 700-1000 noncrit on lesser healing wave while blasting enemies with upto 4k damage every 6 seconds... until oom.
---
Elementals really live the hybrid dream. Big damage, great heals, awesome support with tremor, grounding, WF totem, purge, cleanse etc.
---
A lock without shards is a useless lock. Min maxing or otherwise. And we don't need to drink but we eat non stop.
---
Actually most try hard guilds will probably want you to play hybrid vs full resto etc. Especially when it comes to speed running. Healing output doesnt drop off that much by going deep into elemental or balance.
---
I posted this in a thread where someone asked what specs Classic will run on:  
---
The client runs on a slimmed down and retrograded Legion client, if you can run Legion you can run classic.  
---
If you are unsure of how well your PC runs Legion, these are the recommended specifications:
---
(however, Classics new "Classic mode" lowers the recommended specs a tad)
---
"The best chance at playing **World of Warcraft**: **Legion** at recommended sys **specs** on a 1920x1080 screen resolution will be if your PC has at least the GeForce GTX 750 Ti/Radeon R7 260X v2 graphics card. The CPU required to meet recommended requirements is either an AMD FX-6300 or Intel Core i5-3330 3.0GHz processor."
---
One thing to take note of, the client they used for the retrograding does not have the current multithreading optimizations that the BFA client has and therefore thrives on a higher single core speed over multiple slower cores.
---
Hope it helps
---
I don't have anything certain, but going by the Phase 5 notes this would fall in with the  
---
&gt;Dungeon loot reconfiguration: Tier 0.5 Dungeon gear, Relics, drop rates and location changes 
---
There are certain dungeon items introduced in later patches that are flat better than raid gear and would mess with progression too much to not keep it staggered. I believe they said the loot tables like the ones you mentioned for MC/Ony are static, and items will not get updated stats throughout the phases.
---
I'll be pleasantly surprised if dungeon items from later patches are available from the start, but I am leaving these off my lists for now. Many of them seem "too good to be true" especially when compared to what raid difficulty content will be dropping.
---
1.7 is when SP/HP stopped affecting "on heal" affects such as crusader. I did not see anything about damage affects In the patch notes and wowhead comments seem to indicate there was still scaling happening for damage items.
---
I was in high school and couldn‚Äôt get my character past lvl 50
---
Beta is determined randomly. Only buy a sub if you feel you can get some enjoyment out of BfA/retail because getting into the beta is not guaranteed.
---
Well, because he is funny and he is in no way an elitist. For example, just today he was talking about how there is more than one way to be good in the game. One way is to have skill, the other to get decked out in tier gear. He said he likes this as he acknowledges his lack of skill but hopes getting gear will save him.  
---
Your description of what you think he‚Äôs like shows you don‚Äôt ‚Äòget‚Äô him, which is fine. Short answer; he has such a huge following because that huge following do find him entertaining, and he has a bigger following than any other wow streamer.
---
MSN Messenger FTW!!! My god the hours I spent on that...
---
Playing often is different than playing 20 hours a day
---
Flying bad people tend to talk about how its bad for world pvp and decreases chance encounters out in the open world and makes the game feel less like a living breathing world
---
It has less to do with the content of Westfall and more to do with the sheer number of times I've been through there.
---
&gt;	Who the f struggles on any boss in MC, lol?
---
Any raid that is new to MC and has not one healer specced for healing will likely struggle at least for a few weeks in MC.
---
I'd like an addon that would point out to me when someone say LFM &lt;instance i wanna go to&gt; so I can whisper them and form a group :)
---
Don‚Äôt know if someone said it already, but they should just pull an OSRS with classic.
---
I wish I had beta invite. Cause retail wow is about to make me unsubscribe. But honestly I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not playing it right now. That way I get a really fresh start win it opens up officially that won‚Äôt go away. The time I put in then is the real deal. I am surviving now with classic streams and I actually picked up D3 again with the new season. The grinds game play is satisfying my need to play right now. So it feels pretty good.
---
Also this is TBC pre-patch.
---
You can tell because of the "Tree of Life" buff at the top of his buff bars.  Druids didn't get this until TBC.
---
Still, 12/15 is damn impressive.
---
Because they suck. Enh shaman is a weaker Warrior, with much more RNG. Kited very easily in Vanilla.
---
Everyone is different.
---
I've played vanilla servers on and off since 2011 (also played retail back then, stopped after TBC) and I still enjoy the endgame. I love competing on the DPSmeter in raids, trying to do everything i possibly can to dish out every last DPS I can, it's fun for me. I can compete with myself, others in my raid and on the server, and performing well is super fun to me.
---
There's always something to do, you always need to go back to MC forever because of that last BiS piece you and so many others desperately need, but your guild had shit RNG. You still need to go to ZG to get idols for your head and leg enchant whenever you get upgrades, you need exalted with cenarion hold and brood for earthstrike and the exalted ring, you still need DFT from ebonroc, you still need to farm consumables. PvP is super fun and gearing to make you even more powerful is fun too. Helping friends and new guildies gear up and helping them reach their goals is fun too. Just messing around in the world, ganking people, making them miserable and competing over resources is fun.  
---
Fuck, even deep into AQ40 farm when you're finally able to get your damn DFT or quick strike ring you've been longing for for months, maybe over a year, and now you can perform even better? Damn, that feels fucking good to me.
---
We're all different, but there's so much to do if you want to.
---
Could you provide me a link as to where they said this. I'd like to know a date I can start pre-loading and making characters as to reserve names and such.
---
Well i guess fuck me, my subscription ran out 20 min ago.... But i want to play..... but i don't want to pay and be only able to play BfA, i want classic beta!
---
To be fair, perception is nearly useless. 
---
The spirit and rep gains are much more attractive holistically speaking.
---
There's a lot of "non-competitive" personality types that like to still participate in competitive things but whine about being losers the entire way...
---
&gt; TBC 60-70, then delete Outland and replace with Northrend 60-70, then delete Northrend and replace with Cata end zones 60-70, and vice-versa.
---
I like most of this. But instead of deleting the area, maybe its just treated as a new timeline. Once you hit level 60 in the main base game, each expansion is a stand alone where you clone your character into this new realm. That realm stands alone away from the base game and all leveling and gear progress stays there. The next expansion comes along, and its the same thing. You clone that same level 60 version of yourself and progress to 70.
---
So all the gear and progress from Burning Crusade stays in its own alternate timeline and doesn't transfer over when Lich King comes out.
---
I like levelling. I want to level. I have so many alts that I've started levelling. And almost every time, I grind out cooking and my other professions... only to be disappointed every time with making all this +1 stam/+1 vers food, +5 health to bracers (when I have 1000+ hp already without heirlooms)... I WANT to do those things, but I want them to mean something. Sucks to make what should be level appropriate food, only to just sell it immediately for a bit of gold because it just isn't worth the bag space. Classic can't come soon enough!
---
i mean, if you want to take Engineer, take it for PvP if anything. taking Engineering might make certain phases a few seconds faster.
---
You're absolutely mad if you think a 19 hour video game session is defensible.
---
**Sorry, but this isn't Vanilla.**
---
It's in the TBC pre-patch. You have the "Tree of Life" buff on you, a spell that didn't exist until the 2.0 prepatch.
---
Is ElvUI still a thing? That was a god send. As a healer all I care about is some sort of raid frames addon and clique.
---
This will happen. It existed in retail as an addon before blizz made it official.
---
Yeah, you're right
---
People can do whatever they want
---
Wow will never be what it once was
---
This thread made me realize there are 3 types of people that will be playing classic, a small subset of retail players, private server players, and people brought back by nostalgia most I presume will quit after a few months.
---
Yeah, I've lost interest in classic, it's not for me, stupid thread
---
Can confirm...click botted my way through most AVs after doing a couple 2 day long slug fests. It‚Äôs fun the first time, but not when you‚Äôre trying to get to exalted in a reasonable amount of time
---
Exactly. In the warcraft 3 manual they talk about how sargeras found the nathrezim and the eredar and noted how supremely evil they were.
---
&gt; If they don't raise the cap then it was useful the entire time you were on the character.
---
Yes totally worth fishing for 6 hours to get a 12 slot bag. Those extra 2 slots will be useful the entire time you're on that character.
---
Well let see, 15 years ago, my computer had 256 RAM on a Pentium 4 processor and ran in a standard integrated video card... and I was a AQ40 healer.  My uncle later on gave me and 256 RAM upgrade.  Any idea on how I can get my hands on that dream boat again?
---
Yes, except I AM NOT IN THE BETA.
---
yikes not being able to laugh at yourself.. quite defensive there valzorrr
---
So Alchemy will be useful since the very early unlike never in BfA?
---
DUDUDUDU DUDUDUDU DUDUDUDU DUDU LET IT GO
---
Devastate as well, it was the protection 41-pointer introduced with the TBC talent trees.
---
Because I as a individual might have met the fierce dwarven hunter "u/underhunter" in one of my journeys. Him suddenly becoming a gnome would most certainly fuck with my immersion within the game. Apart from that, it's a MTX which can give players an advantage (some racials are good for X whereas others are good for Y) so players willing to spend money on race changing will have a edge (no matter how small that edge may be).
---
Ehhhhh you say that, but then you get in a never ending AV turtle and it really isn't all that great.  Speaking from a lot of recent experience on private servers.
---
Wrong
---
This is a woosh for me; straight over my head.
---
You arent expected to stay in the bg for 19 whole hours. Old AV had people drop out and join back in many hours later.
---
It's a battleground about resources. Literally a battle of attrition. It's long.
---
spot on
---
what constitutes vanilla?
---
People with real problems will be getting help if they are lucky. Smart people with no self esteem will utilize this and get paid to play games.
---
Na, all low level dungeons are 5-man.
---
Ahhh gotcha, that makes alot more sense. I've exclusively played horde from vanilla till now so I'm sure it's the exact same way I feel about the barrens
---
I never said it wasn't worth the investment, I'm just looking to the future. Are we just gonna ditch this game after we get all the best loot?
---
19 hours of continuous play is completely ludicrous, why did people ever put up with that horseshit?
---
~~Pet attack speeds were normalized in, eh, I think 1.9? But definitely before 1.12, which is what Classic is based off of, so don't concern yourself with things like attack speed when considering a pet.~~Edit: I was thinking of run speed normalization. Yeah, 1.2s attack speed is useful, but there are other reasons not to run Wolves in PvP. If you want insane attack speed for pushback purposes, consider Broken Tooth.
---
If you want a really good little secret (assuming they don't elect to fix the bug as private servers did), tamable beasts that are immune to CC in their original forms‚Äîparticularly the rare Razorfen Krawl bat Blind Hunter‚Äîmaintain their CC immunities after being tamed. Which, I think needless to say, makes them utterly absurd in PvP scenarios. But since this was technically a bug that simply wasn't fixed by the end of Vanilla, you can't be sure that they'll keep it in place with Classic.
---
No one will really be new to MC, and the game is simpler than kid games released today. Anyone will catch up with the "Decurse every 30 seconds and just tank and spank"-mechanics on the bosses.
---
There's also tons of information about everything. New guilds with people who never raided vanilla didn't struggle with MC in 1.11 and 1.12, and they for sure won't now.
---
MC, ZG and BWL will be puggable within weeks from when raiding guilds have started raiding.
---
Thematically, trolls don't do much with demons until later expansions. Especially not the Darkspear trolls.
---
Maybe it doesn't. But you wouldn't want people making empty guilds just for more convenient space, so I think it makes sense to have a progression system where it starts off small and still takes gold to unlock slots.
---
Can we retire the term "tourist" already? It's so elitist and gatekeep-y, I'm suprised adults use in a non satirical manner
---
Ah yes, I didn't even notice that.
---
God, I miss old Devastate.
---
Weren't there "Broken" in swamp of sorrows in Vanilla?
---
go tigers! I can appreciate your overwhelming pride in the tigers that you would name your reddit account after them
---
God man, if u do that in Classic you'll probably have Cancer wished upon your family. I miss gaming back in that era
---
Do you need an active sub to participate?
---
That's fair.  I stand corrected.  Thanks for pointing this out!
---
this may or may not be a dumb question, if you die in a zone, can you ghost walk to another graveyard to take the spirit healer resurrection?  That way you are walking by dangerous areas as a ghost at 125% speed?  or is this too dumb of a method since you dont get to get any exploration xp as a ghost?
---
Sorry, man. It's hard to remember. And it will fluctuate based on supply and demand. If there aren't enough enchanters and no recipes learned yet, prices will skyrocket. I remember Large Brilliant Shards, which were common disenchant resources from endgame dungeons, sold for around 4g a piece.
---
Equipment from quest rewards generally don't have level requirements.  If you're eligible for the quest and can complete it, you can use the item.
---
Whirlwind Axe is a good example.  You get the quest at 30, but the axe itself is like a level 40 weapon because you absolutely CAN'T do that quest at 30 without being carried or with a group of other 30-35 warriors.
---
Ive been listening to yt streams too.
---
I am so fucking excited to have classic and everything hard back. 
---
I hate retail... since cata. 
---
They stripped it down too much, made it too casual.
---
I don‚Äôt hate it on the same level as the person above, but the way I see it there‚Äôs a loss of identity with the system.
---
You *are* a Night Elf Rogue. You *are* an Orc Hunter. You *are* a Gnome Warlock. So on and so forth. Your identity in the game world is a big factor. Your class and class are, in some ways, just as important as your name and faction. By adding payed race/faction changes, part of what makes you *you* is no longer quite as relevant. You can *say* you‚Äôre a Human Paladin, but with a click of a button and some numbers on a credit card, you can become a Dwarf, thus tarnishing that identity.
---
at max level you will run into issues because there is not alot of defense gear for non warriors
---
and if you want to be able to tank bosses you really need that defense rating to not receive and crushing blows... your main chance is to farm the deathbone set in scholomance really ... otherwise you cant do shit
---
5 man dungeons and even ubrs are easy AF tho for pally tanks and in aoe situations even superior to warriors
---
Joke would have been funny had I actually used the word ‚Äúto‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwith‚Äù so that‚Äôs why you get the downvote. So close but so far :)

That's a really strange thing to legitimately worry about, why do you care so much about them?

I just wanted to make a joke from ur name tbh, saw his comments on monkey news and it was a YIKES
---
Attack speeds weren‚Äôt normalized until 2.0 pre patch. Everything else was.
---
I would say no for pvp though as wolves don‚Äôt have a focus dump.
---
Edit: [2.0.3 undocumented change](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.3_(undocumented_changes))
---
Edit 2: blind hunter was the only pet that retained their cc immunity throughout vanilla, all other tameable bosses had it fixed before 2.0.
---
Vanilla and Bc had all the same decision makers. Wrath had most of them too. 
---
BC is probably the game they wanted to make (basically vanilla refined and with new content), Wrath was the game they thought could make even more money.
---
You seem to have a wealth of knowledge to the inner workings of Blizzard and their staff.
---
yeah the darkspear it makes sense them not being locks i suppose, I'm more thinking of the enemy trolls i guess

Who the hell puts their porn in desktop

---
Hardest part of classic raiding is getting 40 people to show up for the raid in the first place.
---
Yes, Cross Realm BG's are good for the game.
---
They are using a new system called ‚Äòlayering‚Äô which is essentially one continent is a giant shard of 3,000 people.
---
Edit: this system is dynamic and will change based on server population - also everyone in each layer is an individual that occupies your server, and is quoted to be removed by phase 2.
---
Alliance never wins BGs anyway. They should just auto give horde the win each game, save time.
---
Invite people who can res
---
It's still impressive you got 12/15.
---
Layering will be a thing around launch.
---
Lol all the streamers wanting to roll enhanc because of this guy.  Enhanc is honestly pretty garbage until you get good enough gear, and good luck being able to raid as enhanc.  And then it's still very RNG dependant, plus you can just get kited all day long.  But if by some miracle you grind a hand of rag and a top pvp rank then yes you will roll faces.
---
If you're okay with building your own (it's really not that hard), look up /r/pcmasterrace. And look on the sidebar for builds (https://www.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace/wiki/builds). The lowest build there should run classic fine.
---
I started a toon on a vanilla private server to get used to it before classic and I'm having a blast!
---
This is 100% my reasoning as well.
---
I think he means mass autoloot. You had to loot all the corpses individually I believe if you kill a large pack.
---
Do non WoW names ruin your immersion? Tbh Im just not convinced that it does anything to ruin journeys or give an edge. Luckily we‚Äôre playing a snapshot of history so we know exactly which races are good or not good with classes. However if this wasn‚Äôt the case, itd suck to pick Dwarf only to have racials nerfed for example. Or realize you just hate all armor on your dwarf, but night elves look good in armor and youd want to change. Theres no way of knowing these things at roll time.
---
&gt;a lot of us were in the same guild on beta because it didn't matter
---
 My entire point in that sentence you used to summarize 5 paragraphs was that guilds and progression didn't matter. Nothing really mattered but testing what was available and **having fun**. There's no point for ego or being elitist, wanting to do things with only rank 1 players or A team mythic raiders is just not possible on Beta. 
---
Everyone was in the same guild, just like on beta now mostly everyone is either in the guild Classic or Make Azeroth Great Again. The entire point there is that in this environment, that is currently being showcased to over - half a million? a million people? Is IMHO not the experience they're going to get once it goes live and raiding and battlegrounds are top priority for people. The qualities people are falling in love with, that are constantly listed in top posts on this sub, might not be there later on. I personally find that to be a problem as it tends to be a larger repeating pattern with every expansion. 
---
Think about what its like early on in any expansion. Everyone is still in a honeymoon phase. Running dungeons, gearing up, world pvp, bgs, unranked arenas, groups have a diverse level of skill usually accepting anyone. It always feels very open, very diversely populated, very light hearted, very fun. That all sorta goes away once the majority are level capped and priorities shift to raid progression/ranked pvp over the long haul. The larger point I was making was this problem is not exclusive to any single expansion, and could potentially be the same for Classic, and what can we as a community do about that? So hopefully now you can see why I'm annoyed how you chose to summarize what I was saying.
---
We are getting "layering" which is essentially the entire server sliced into giant shards.  So you'd in theory see the same people over and over on your layer, but there are other versions of the entire map with other people you're not seeing.
---
They have said this is for a limited time only.
---
I don't want sharding but I want layering because it actually gets rid of the worst parts of sharding. As long as it's not permanent, it's completely fine.
---
Weak effort
---
the chance is still very slim. it's 0.1% on 1.12
---
Dual spec would be great, since not all specs are super viable in raid, and I PVP.
---
Optimal build were a not an issue back then because nobody had access to information. 
---
Seeing a character over level 40 that didn‚Äôt even had a spec was not even rare.
---
You need:

---
* 5 Firebloom
---
A lot of these crafted items have cooldowns, won't be cheap.
---
Damn I totally forgot about dying to that big bastard. I wonder how long until blizz announces BC servers...I'd love to actually do all of the raids, since I was still leveling for almost all of BC
---
Do you have a talent build you could link that someone in the above gear set would use?
---
What patch was this during?
---
Really? That seems a bit absurd. Or perfectly rational if you're an angry toddler.
---
Respond to me on the 27th. I'll gladly eat my shorts if you prove me wrong. There will be 3000 people spread across 6 starting zones.
---
Noob question... but from what I've read, it seemed to me that Shamans were quite meh in PvP and PvE (both as DPS) in Vanilla.
---
But how are Enhance and Elemental on PvP and PvE?
---
Adderall: Play 48 hours strait.
---
Pot: Play 10 hours, sleep, wake up, "why the fuck am I a level 1 ghost???"
---
Meh, I wouldn't want to get farmed by a 10 man premade full of rank 1 players as my little 5 man stack. I don't blame them for taking the 15 minute debuff.
---
WoWhead actually imported Thotbot comment database
---
Classic nes!
---
Do not sub in the hopes of beta access, literally the worst thing you can do.
---
Spirit the most valuable stat for warriors while leveling to 30 for solo leveling
---
In 2019, Thotbot and Thottbot would be two very different things.  At least, I would hope so.
---
Yeah, I take that back. I was thinking of *run* speed, which was indeed normalized in 1.9 alongside the Lupos change.
---
yikes. Sounds to me like you've only played private servers.
---
That's just my opinion though, might not be a truth.
---
It‚Äôs potentially because there are some laws in the works based on preserving old versions of software  and video games (bigger issue now with nearly every game falling under the ‚Äúgames as a service‚Äù (GaaS) model) which would make private servers and potentially the monetization of them legal, so they need to nip it in bud by snagging those funds for themselves. 
---
That being said, Retail is actually dogshit right now and Classic might as well be an effort to keep their sub numbers up, it got my sub..
---
Edit: some words
---
Playing Pillars of Eternity 2 with all DLCs and also Titan Quest with new Expansion. Next week I will be playing Chaosbane, so nope, gaming is great! :D Classic will be great! Life is great!
---
Middle Schoolers in 2005?
---
I mean MC can probably be comleted with 10 decent players
---
If you like multispec, BFA is waiting for you.
---
I would like to know how much time he spent on it.
---
&gt;To be fair the streamer premades are full out sperg and farm lvl 30 prebis lol
---
wtf do these words mean, lmao
---
This is 100% our mindset as paladins, not even just prot spec, but coming from playing a paladin starting in BC and going back to the class on pservers, paladin players seem to be committed to finding that secret formula of talents and rotations to make dps and tanking viable.
---
I do think there is merit to this (I've been able to create some interesting builds with high sustain and respectable dps by spending more into the holy tree and less into ret), but not as far as tanking goes.  There's unfortunately just not enough wiggle room in that spec/tree to make any more meaningful progress as a mana-sustainable tank it seems.
---
You had me at ice cream cake
---
Yep, a few of us are working on one. Hoping to have a version ready for launch.
---
That‚Äôs probably true for most. For thecsort of people who wouldn‚Äôt have been raiding 15 years ago, Vanilla does lack content. These are the people who enjoy pet battles and the endless collections blizzard has on retail (900+ plate chestpieces for warriors to tmog into‚Äîgotta catch all) etc.
---
For some, the enjoyment is playing the game to its breaking point. 
---
Either way, accessible endgame or not, the first 200+ hours played of classic is a COMPLETELY different experience to retail. That will hook a lot of people, and turn others away. For most people in 04-06 that first 200+ hours was the game. 
---
On another note, $30-$45 for 200-250 hours of gameplay is a pretty solid price. So even if you do get bored at 60, it took you two-three months irl to get there probably 7-10 days played. That‚Äôs a worthwhile purchase.
---
i've seen this video so many times, and the fact that he doesnt use Stormstrike in the first bit of the video still blows my mind!
---
Just trying to keep up with my friends while levelling my warrior.  Maybe level 40 but I'd be okay with 30 and professions caught up
---
Much appretiate you taking an interest in my dilemma! Can you tell me a couple of words on Enhancement pvp potential. I keep reading that it's a diceroll and it's boring. Have you tried it? What's your experience with the spec?
---
Swoosh
---
You gotta stack that diamant√© and make it extravagant√© for +100 DPS, that‚Äôs how i always played my huntant√©
---
Fair, but for one, I‚Äôm quoting the [Onyxia Wipe Animation](https://youtu.be/HtvIYRrgZ04)  (Captain Obvious, I know) and two, what the other guy replying said‚Äî better cringey than wiped. 
---
I unfortunately was in a guild with at least one person who I am not certain could count to twenty without taking off his socks and shoes; I sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt trust him to know what odd &amp; even numbers were.
---
Maybe posts like these are the reason no one talks to you in groups.
---
What endgame? Everything has been done, people got so much better at the game that the raids won't last a reset...
---
I just got invite to 2nd one and i didnt have invite to 1st. Acct from thanksgiving 2004 if u care about that fact. Was active from launch thru cata. Came back at end of wod (hated it) then unsubbed again. Then played for all  of legion and thru to today in bfa
---
The class changes happened all throughout vanilla, from a couple months to almost 2 years after release.
---

---
As you can see, 3 classes had their revamps on and after naxx, but they will be in from day 1
---
You can because dismount isn't on the gcd iirc.  It has to be a cancel aura macro though I think
---
ok not prebis just bis but it means best in slot
---
I just want the mount and pet tab to save bag space on my chicken egg or snake buddy.
---
Fucking Fileplanet!
---
Doesn't seem like it's worth getting in a tizzy over. I spend much more than that on water for a single dungeon run. Of course mages help with that but in my experience the group is not interested in my drink breaks taking 50-100% longer because of inferior conjured water.
---
Yeah, nothing wrong with that. If you dont do it too excessively
---
Lol. BIS Has been around for a long time, but this isn‚Äôt the first I‚Äôve seen ‚Äòprebis‚Äô also I have no idea what a ‚Äòsperg‚Äô is.
---
It‚Äôs really not a bad thing. Everyone still has to meet up and walk to the dungeon.
---
Yeah that video doesn't show how many times you just stand there praying it procs.. also he was not only often in way better gear but also vs newbies backpedaling and keyboard turning
---
I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone that plays 20/hrs a day consistently. AV does not take that level of dedication. Maybe 9-10/hrs a day for the highest levels of farmers. I can't play nearly that much but I don't want them to change the game for me, I'd rather just accept maybe I am not the intended audience than have Blizz nuke the game for me which is exactly how we're in the predicament in the first place.
---
Yeah it is totally impossible that a re-skinned Legion client, that they even admitted they had to redo a lot of stuff because it was misreading things, could be unauthentic.
---
&gt;its bad for world pvp and decreases chance encounters out in the open world 
---
Agreed 100%
---
&gt;makes the game feel less like a living breathing world
---
This is where I disagree. It always felt like (at least in wrath) that Blizzard missed an opportunity to reinvigorate wpvp by designing desirable flying locations to have the potential for wpvp. Yes, people would still be able to afk in the sky high above danger, but in the end they are just sitting there doing nothing over what could have been a hotly contested pvp area. Granted, I'm woefully naive to the entire process of level design.
---
I'm not saying it's what happened but It is possible. One of the reasons Bliz gave for a classic version not being possible was because they didn't have an archived code base from vanilla. So they've had to rebuild the current code from somewhere and just for arguement sake potentially it's from 3.1 when levelling was easier.
---
I agree memories are unreliable and it's entirely possible that it is a combination of difference in ability and inaccurate memories. Which is why I'd my old recordings or could find some from 2006/7.
---
The patch cycle from 1.1.0 (2004-11-07) (US release version) up to and including 1.12.2 (EU) (2006-10-13) (Drums of War).
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x
---
Dungeon Finder, by far. Not for raiding though, just dungeons.
---
Making palas viable tanks would be neat too.
---
No, go back to retail.
---
Jokes on them, I don't have BFA, only Legion still.
---
I meant more that it applied sunder armor.
---
Maybe I just miss sunder armor more...
---
Been playing since like 2005. The game is ruined.
---
I'm glad I stopped paying Blizzard a cent after WOTLK. They fucked up hard. Here's to hoping they pull their head out of their ass for Classic.
---
Lmao, balance is a worse mage / lock at everything and feral is a worse rogue.
---
But yeah go on and tell me how people want  to play classic to enjoy underpowered classes and specs.
---
I'm doing the same thing! 
---
I'm finishing Illidan first, but are there any good recommendations for the Kirin Tor or the Darkspear Trolls? I'll be rolling a troll mage, so that should be fun.
---
Sperg=try very hard
---
prebis is just shortened pre-raid bis
---
Lol nice.
---
This makes no sans. The original poster said this is the last thing you see before you die, making it 100%. Not 20%. 20% means there's a big chance (at least 20%) you don't see this before you die, and a big chance (at least 20%) of you don't not seeing this before you die, which defeats the porpoise of whatever nerdy crap this is about.
---
My only suspicion is that your trying to troll, and I don't appreciate that. I don't want my reeding of commints to be filled with trash like this, so I downloaded you.
---
Hi, /u/Norian45
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Even if you are piecemealing the tie spent in it, it's just ludicrous to me that people actually want something requiring that much time back in the game. My AV battles never took that long and they got decided just fine within a reasonable amount of time. Alliance stalls us out on their highly defensible mountain fortress then runs roughshod over our poorly reinforced wooden barricades in open field. Quick, decisive, ~~balanced~~.
---
iirc that macro works, but you have to press the button twice.
---
Aktually at high levels it's pretty much consensus alliance have a big advantage with pallies and horde shouldn't ever really win with bis comp/gear/skill players.
---
Possibly the WORST PC hardware advice I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
They do, that's why they wanted it in the first place. That's why thousands of people play Vanilla PServers. Delusional.
---
Critneyfears for those destro locks
---
So the problem is that it happens too quickly? Like if I just deleted the Old toon, suddenly its okay? Or if I switched mains and retired a too am I still that toon? 
---
I agree about Faction xfer, in classic thats completely different than retail, so faction matters. Id argue so does name. But race? It‚Äôs just not important. Like I said in my other reply to someone else, we‚Äôre getting a snapshot of history. So we know what race/class combos are good. But if the game changes..it would suck if your race gets randomly nerfed. Or if youre a new player and like Humans, so you roll one. But then you see T2 on a Dwarf and suddenly armor looks like shit on humans and all you want is your toon but as a dwarf. I dont think its a big deal. 
---
Does changing your name in real life change who _you_ are? Id argue it doesn‚Äôt.
---
yeah it was for the ultraxion fight , it lowered your big def cd by 50% so you could soak hour of twilight ( which dealt around 300 k dmg when tank had 200~k )
---
I'm rolling a Dwarf Priest. Mostly for flavor because I love dwarves, but also because of Fear Ward!
---
First thing I'm doing is getting out of the start area + all quests. Exception - I'll be skipping the "felix's bucket of bolts" quest because that is going to be camped hard.
---
Once I make it to Ironforge, I'll pick up Skinning and Tailoring as professions. Skinning for nice supplemental income as I level, and Tailoring so I can level it as I go and work toward Truefaith Vestments.
---
As soon as I hit level 11 in Dun Morogh &amp; parts of Loch Modan, I'll hightail it back to Ironforge and level my Tailoring from all the cloths I've stacked, as well as sell the leather I've been accumulating from Skinning. I'll buy a Lesser Magic Wand if there are already some being sold as well.
---
I may take a brief visit to Elwynn Forest and do some of the quests there to hit level 12, like Hogger and Princess. 
---
I will then take the famous shortcut to Auberdine through the north passage in Dun Morogh, take an intentional death, res at the graveyard near Menethil Harbor, and after tagging the flight path, I'll sail on a boat to Auberdine (if I make it in one piece, that is!)
---
Then, I will be in the coziest leveling experience vanilla has to offer - Darkshore! It won't be as densely populated as westfall or loch modan, AND there are way more quests! From there, I'll level in the natural progression of Night elves until I have to go to Stranglethorn Vietnam.
---
Beyond that, I'm not too sure! It'll be a journey and I can't wait.
---
Ret is a free kill that can RNG burst someone if they aren't paying attention. If anyone tries to initiate with a ret, the ret needs to be really good to handle it compared to other classes. 
---
Enh shaman are stuck in roots and snares casting lesser healing wave
---
[Nope!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgU4Oum8SLg)
---
Ok, then report it with the tools provided in the beta. Why post it here??
---
Dude who the fuck is gonna drop their BG when the que could be hours long?
---
&gt; and one side was just getting farmed for hours and hours and the people getting farmed just wanted it to end to get their rewards.
---
I think I've identified the problem.
---
I‚Äôve taken a sabbatical from retail wow and started playing ffxiv to fill the mmo void in my spare time. I keep trying to cast spells when I‚Äôm mounted and I just get a notification that I‚Äôm unable too. Wow ruined me.
---
No, he had to leave because he was already running late and the chat told him to just go. He said he'll try again tomorrow (ie: today now)
---
I just thought they were weak at fresh 60 but scale really well in later patches. This might just be referring to  PVE then.
---
&gt;Blizz made me change that name for some reason though..
---
Maybe they thought it was...Ovensive.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zXDo4dL7SU
---
Well, I have been inside Blizzard HQ a few times a year, (during Classic / TBC launch) and saw it first hand. Many of the newer employees are fucking retarded.
---
The older ones from the Classic were more relaxed, and just generally handled everything better.
---
How can this be vanilla if you have addons of any kind? /s
---
Cool screenshot, fun fight.
---
If all you ever do is add new content for level 60 you still run into the same problems. If they keep the same level cap(not saying they shouldn‚Äôt) but add several more raids it won‚Äôt be long before people can run MC with smaller and smaller groups because the power creep is still there. It trivializes old content and a majority of players will skip it by having guild alt carries where they gear up dozens of alts quickly by carrying them through old content. While you‚Äôre at the same level cap, and it‚Äôll happen slower, content will still become trivial through power creep. Just keeping the cap the same doesn‚Äôt fix any problems, it just slows things down. There‚Äôs no good solution to this problem though. If you keep content relevant for too long it becomes stale. If you make it irrelevant it becomes dead content. It‚Äôs a rough decision blizzard has to make.
---
An image of a cheerleader with text encouraging someone to literally grab her? And you're implying that it's all okay? Because people were more relaxed? Please.
---
You are right, but you're still nuts!!
---
There was once a time... when you couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúdelete‚Äù recycle bin from desktop iirc :(
---
Are you talking about automated dynamic caps or the fact they changed them manually up until later? Members of the team back when Vanilla was out have said they tweaked the numbers as required. The equipment could handle around 4 or 5K before burning to death at the time they just where controlling the numbers as required
---
&gt; I'm not saying it's what happened but It is possible.
---
You keep saying that. I keep telling you that it isn't. They have debunked this possibility. With ample evidence.
---
&gt; One of the reasons Bliz gave for a classic version not being possible was because they didn't have an archived code base from vanilla.
---
They got the original code base. This is not accurate anymore.
---
&gt; So they've had to rebuild the current code from somewhere and just for arguement sake potentially it's from 3.1 when levelling was easier.
---
This is false because they have access to the original code base. Read the blogs. It is 1.12 that they are using.
---
&gt; Which is why I'd my old recordings or could find some from 2006/7.
---
Again, for the last time, **Blizzard has a copy of vanilla from the ORIGINAL CODE up and running to compare against.** They are literally comparing it to the game as it was in vanilla. 
---
This is not a disputable point. Your position is not possible. You lack insight into the dev blogs that have been posted. I linked you one that shows you directly that you are mistaken in thinking it is possible.
---
I don't know how else to say this. I've stated it at least 5 times now.
---
Basically feral heart the wild with bear crit talents and i would go grab nature swiftness in resto. You just pick the logical choices and whatever you feel fits your playstyle.
---
Like GW2
---
10-15 people are afk during trash. 2-3 people are afk during actual boss fights. If you died to a living bomb, damage meter would normally determine that that person was not even at their computer.
---
Lmao, imagine thinking if you arent willing to sit in a 19 hour long AV then you're a casual who should just "pick something else"
---
Then stop queuing into it on purpose while laughing about it, wasting everyone's time.
---
I‚Äôm anxiously waiting for the RFD attempts. It‚Äôs kinda silly honestly.
---
I'm aware. He's a fucking idiot for real. "YoU ThiNK yoU WaNT iT HURRRRRRRRRR"
---
I hope they somehow keep his dumb ass out from touching it. I think he got the position due to nepotism or money, because he is truly a fucking idiot when it comes to WoW. Look at subscriber numbers for proof.
---
Okay thanks for the info. It seems theres strong consensus now that this is a bug and it shouldn't be in the game. I haven't seen a blizz response yet but hopefully one surfaces soon
---
From what every defender of the theory that classic is vastly superior to retail, saving time is what killed WoW. Get good scrub, play like a man and spend 5 min to loot a pile of corpses.
---
People who want it back in the game who the people who want classic.
---
Why would I want zergfest AV in classic when I can go play that on current wow with the all of the other changes that got us here.
---
Beautiful blue case...I bet that bitch look better red.
---
Lok'tar
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it sucked. It‚Äôs certainly different. PvP since Cata for sure, but the arena age in general has been about meta gaming your opponents cds. 
---
You‚Äôll never kill a healer when your cds aren‚Äôt up on live. Hell, you probably won‚Äôt kill him even if they are.
---
Vanilla wow PvP plays out like a fighting game (1v1 with comparable skill/gear), counters and mind games and set ups. Retail, to me, plays like Pve with pillars and spell interrupts, it‚Äôs about spamming your keys. Vanilla PvP, to me, seems much more personal, what I have to do to beat each class varies a whole lot more than my play style does on live when facing different comps. 
---
I like both, and I‚Äôd say at the upper levels retail PvP is harder. But I do think it‚Äôs a whole lot better of a spectator sport in Vanilla.
---
Yeah, but it's something to do and some of the sets look really nice. :)
---
You know /s denotes sarcasm, right?
---
Oof. Way to be a bigot.  
---
Whole lot of anti semitism in your posts.
---
I think just making the first tab 1k is enough of a barrier that your average joe won‚Äôt be getting a gabble to store stuff.  Now your AH goblins there‚Äôs not much you can do to reign them in other than break TSM but I don‚Äôt see them doing that.
---
There's nothing difficult about an AV filled with AFK bots farming meaningless honor and HKS for 19 hours. You're delusional if you truly believe that.
---
Well, idk if I'd agree with that. The CPU choice is debatable but games that dont have great multicore support (classic right now doesnt have the same multicore support as retail) tend to love higher clock speeds. I play CSGO a ton and since it only supports 3-4 cores, intels run circles around amd, for now at least. But yeah, ryzen 5 will definitely work too if you're able to find one on the cheap.   
---
I wouldn't give someone the advice to buy a GTX 700 series card to play a modern game in 2019 unless its a cheap 780 Ti. If you're running a 760 or 770 you're 100% going to drop below 60 frames in raids. 970 is too cheap to argue that you should buy something shittier in my opinion. After all he wants a smooth experience, it's not very fun to buy something for a purpose and it wont run at a stable 60 fps in rougher situations.
---
Oh I agree I‚Äôll be playing until the servers shut down but eventually they must, or are converted to something new or something
---
People who want to stop playing AV at that current time?
---
Classic is not about instant (or fast) gratification.
---
It's for people who enjoy putting time into stuff.
---
in the US&lt; telcom monopolies are enforced by law. We have multiple companies, but entire regions are exclusive to a single provider.
---
What‚Äôs the problem? If you don‚Äôt want to play it when it‚Äôs out you won‚Äôt be missing out
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Im aiming for 14/13/24
---
The updated graphics as an option for those that want it, and a guild bank
---
Holy nostalgia Batman
---
I‚Äôd like a beta invite, but mostly to try out different classes to see if it helps me make up my mind. Otherwise I‚Äôm still happy doing my rocket league and elite dangerousing
---
And I forgot.
---
5. Hunters always forget to turn off speed aura, that makes everyone daze.
---
Agree. Fury warrior, prot tank and healers are the only fun specs/roles in Vanilla raiding, everything else is brain dead (tbh so is fury it‚Äôs just 4 button brain dead)
---
No respecs! if you want to try a different spec re-roll you fucking casual.
---
I mean that's the problem. You always feel like you HAVE to, or you'll just be gimping yourself. It's stupid, and retail completely sucks. The class design sucks. You guys and the 100 keybinds each class needs, like come on. It doesn't make u good, it makes it a damn mess, and less skill dependant if anything. U can barely remember what skills each class has, so there's barely any counter action gameplay.
---
In Vanilla/BC, if you saw an important CD popped by the other player, you could play around it. Blind or vanish, ice block, fear dot and run for a bit, feint and trap, etc. On retail, every class has a million important CDs, so it really doesn't matter if you Dodge one of them. I shouldn't need over 20 keybinds to play the class optimally in PvP. It's just silly at that point.
---
Dude PvPing as Protection was some of the most fucking fun I've ever had in WoW. I don't mean pure Aggro-Protection (taunt talents, threat talents), but the other protection builds like Shield Block/Improved Revenge/Improved Bash/Concussion Blow, etc. 
---
It's fun as fuck in the middle of a big scrim BG. I never respec'd for tanking, but I will admit my aggro retention wasn't as good as a pure PvE tank. It shifts some of the PvE aggro control onto the other party members since they can't blast quite as hard, however. But you were tougher than nails, and a stun/silence/interrupt machine.
---
What the actual hell are you talking about?
---
Don't make up racist shit because you disagree with someone on a video game.
---
It looks like you're pretty new to warrior, and that's okay, sorry if some of this comes across as a bit harsh. I recommend you stick to a spec with 5/5 tactical mastery and anger management. Look for a cookie cutter build, they are popular for a reason. That being said, here's my review of this spec:
---
If your goal was to skip the best talents in each tree, you nailed it. There is a much better dw tank spec out there, but it's not recommended for anyone who isn't already intimately familiar with the warrior class and the tradeoffs of dw tanking.
---
In prot the key talents you're missing are 5/5 defiance and 1/3 imp shield block. Even in a dw spec you want imp shield block because you will sometimes need a shield and the talent is that good. You also skipped improved sunder armor, which makes your best spammable threat generating ability 20% better.
---
In fury you missed the mark because you should never put more than 20 points in fury without getting 5/5 flurry and bloodthirst. These are the abilities that make fury worthwhile. Piercing howl is an amazingly versatile ability for just a 1 talent point investment, even though it doesn't work on raid bosses.
---
Warrior 31-point talents are always better than 21-point talents, unlike some other classes.
---
my server always ran ubrs as 15man, and lbrs as 5, though as they are raid able i believe you can take a full 40 man raid into ubrs, and into the portal for bwl
---
&gt;garbage expansions
---
TBC would like a word with you.
---
The night elves still dont like magic lol..the mages you see are technically a long secluded pocket of Highborne who didnt go with the Blood Elves, and werent on the side of Azshara
---
In what world is wetlands close to horde territory?
---
Not Classic related.
---
Yes. That is why most of my time is spent on classicdb.ch instead. I tried classic.wowhead and it was very lacking. I'll check back on them later once they get stuff together.
---
Oh look, another link to a twitch clip

Enhance is super garbage. All of the videos you are watching of them shitting on people is pre the nerfs. They were hit with the nerf bat in anticipation of getting a rework. One that didn't come until TBC. Enhance sucks ass. That being said like any other class. You stack enough epic gear and you can clown people. Just as long as they haven't done the same.
---
Windfury is bugged on the beta at the moment, making one of the biggest strengths shaman has at 30 rather lackluster.
---
Its not proccing properly and when it does proc it's not always giving both extra swings. This is probably the main reason.
---
Forgot about the judge refresh.  Been so long.  I still remember much prejudice when dps reqs were not being met on m'uru
---
Fair enough if thats your opinion.
---
Really? I'm actually hoping Blizzard outright bans any addons that attempt to emulate LFG.
---
Only plebs use the armor reduction for anything less than kel thuzad
---
Me neither man, played BC but never pure Vanilla. Have tried a few private servers and really enjoyed it.
---
Still a cool vanilla big crit montage though...
---
He said at the bottom of the post he reported.
---
People were also pretty relaxed about racism in the 50s, doesn't mean it was ok.
---
Oh I know, I was around.  I just couldn't find my ass from a hole in the wall in UC, lol.  Turned me off to the whole race for a very long time.
---
I think any chat addon have some sort of keywords alert.
---
Dude it's nice you wrote such a long post, but I disagree with a few things. 
---
&gt;Anything Blizz will do on the live game won't make you feel the same as the old game, if you don't enjoy it anymore.
---
Sure and I'm not asking them to reroll back WoW back to Classic. That would be insane. However just because BfA is such a terrible expansion it doesn't mean I don't enjoy modern WoW, I don't honestly know why do you think that when I didn't even mention it anywhere.
---
Legion was so pretty damn good. Yeah completely different game than oldshool WoW I used to love, but I didn't mind that. It was the most enjoyable expansion for me since Wotlk and something I would gladly call "modern WoW". 
---
&gt;It's ok to not like the game, maybe you should quit (for a while or better, for good). Never forget the base rule in gaming - you should never play a game if you no longer consider it's fun for you to play it.
---
But why would I quit? As I said, modern WoW gameplay isn't the problem altough you keep giving me examples with old and new cars. 
---
Why I was able to play trough the whole Legion, I mean I was subbed for the whole expansion and I don't regret that. 
---
So why would I even quit for good (I mean really) if I know Blizzard can do better? BfA is dogshit, so I'll just quit for good a game I've been playing since late vanilla?
---
&gt;I personally doubt you will play Classic for 5 years
---
Why I would do that? I'll just wait meanwhile playing Classic until the next retail expansion. Yeah, I'm not coming back to BfA that's for sure. And honestly no one knows what Blizzard's plans with Classic are, if they'll go OSRS route or they'll release TBC. But I hope you don't think Classic ends with Naxx, that's basically already confirmed it won't if there's enough interested people in it and trust me, after two years there will be still more than enough of them.
---
&gt;it's no longer exciting after I've throughoughly inspected it, at this point it already feels as repetitive and non-exciting
---
Well, that's not true for everyone tho. I mean do you realize there are private servers out there? I enjoy going the old OG just as I used to back in the pre-Cata days. Nights are just much better and it's whole old design feels more realistic, brutal. The new OG is just weird. And that applies to the many other locations in game. I haven't played on private servers since Nost shutdown, however I used to play on many of them, vanilla, TBC, Wotlk so I'm so used to the old world, yet somehow I get chills every time I enter OG with new character. Something that doesn't happen on retail.
---
It's almost like you don't know there are other battle grounds you can do that will be shorter, and that everything doesn't need to be for you.
---
This is going to be the defining difference between vanilla players and people coming from newWoW. I was watching a twitch chat argue earlier that the high warlord grind should be removed because "it's too hard to get rank 14". That's backwards. The high warlord 'grind' (which still required you to WIN GAMES) is still talked about today because it was so hard that only a few people ever did it.
---
You want rare feats? Go to vanilla and take part in epic 19 hour AVs.You want easy content that is on rails? Go to live.
---
Everyone complaining that they only want a slight tweak to have it more their way are the exact same people that got us live.
---
I wish I could upvote this a million times!! I freaking LOVED AV in the day.
---
Have you tried path of exile?
---
imagine getting burned out from classic
---
Yeah. I fell asleep with my finger on the W key in my guild's first 10-man Strat. Pulled everything. Never lived it down. Used to fall asleep in raids all the time. ~8 years later, diagnosed with narcolepsy.
---
Good share hopefully if anyone else sees one they will post here
---
More varied Raid encounter mechanics.
---
&gt;  Legion build vestige.
---
Did Legion change how the city boss NPCs worked?
---
The Ret/Shockadin loves makes me want to vomit
---
Holy Paladins are bar none the best support in the game....Easily one of the most if not the most broken spec holistically
---
And these plebs wanna do damage with the worst kit for it in the game. WHAT?
---
I'm on my own little crusade to save the NA scene from shitty paladin off specs.
---
Idiots venerating idiots. It's disgusting.
---
What they need to do is make Mythic+ give equal iLvl gear from every raid, and to make it fresher scale up older content for Mythic+(change every week)
---
So say this week Mythic+ is ALL Bfa content(not just latest patch) + say Tempest Keep and Black Temple. Just up iLvl every patch and you have easy stream of content
---
It depends, I honestly can‚Äôt remember what ‚Äúdismount‚Äù was considered in vanilla, and I can‚Äôt test on Beta. 
---
The rule is if it‚Äôs a unique action (i.e. requires a button press), you must press a button twice. 
---
In other words as someone else mentioned, a macro like the one you put there would work if you pressed it twice.
---
Rets not a meme. It's a very good spec you are very bad at playing. The reason why people shit on it so much is because they want to pressure you into being holy because, it's the best support in the game by a mile. Ret paladins with gear hit reasonably hard and still have access to all the uber op pally support spells like BoF, BoP, Cleanse, Bubble, and BoS.

16gb is barely enough for chrome to even launch these days. And what it doesn‚Äôt devour it leaks in a few minutes anyway.

As a player from vanilla, i'd argue that transmog is one of the key things that absolutely killed the game. There is no sense of achievement anymore. Visual indicators of someones progress are gone, whilst levelling, you know roughly how likely you are to be able to gank someone based on their gear. It just flat out ruined wow. Once you get that tier set, you'd be proud and patrolling in it, and people might think twice about bothering to gank you. Everyone being dressed in achievements they did at some point takes way from the characters behind those achievements. Is this the first person to attain a particular item that is an utter ballache and requires a decent raid that I should be shit scared of? Or is this Sircaptainalt, slayer of the dragons 6 months ago on an alt, that might have been in the instance. It just utterly murders immersion and any sense of accomplishment. I'd argue transmog is probably one of the biggest mistakes that blizzard made in killing their own game. It also made items worthless, why would I give a toss about a pair of leather shoulders, when based on some previous experiences on another character, I can make it look like the best shoulder item in the game. From an mmorpg perspective, that makes zero fucking sense. I'm a pretty weak low level character, but I can just pay some gold and visually equip the best things in the game and still be shit. Such bad decisions. Fuck.
---
I agree, as long as they bring demon hunters back again. By far my fav class playing from day 1 vanilla through bfa. I‚Äôd love to see them introduce the class into a vanilla style game.
---
I know eventually they were able to increase them for major patches and expansion launches; but I think this was around WotLK, when they better realized the population surges associated with these events.
---
I'm not 100% on late vanilla, but early on the realm populations caps were static.
---
I'm still not sure how people get around defense actively reducing the usefulness of enrage. That's my big concern, if you will get enough (or any) procs on live without sit enrage.
---
Seems silly to you. Is the reason why people play the game for others.
---
You can hide cloaks and helms in classic through the interface settings
---
Ah ok thanks for clarifying. I didn‚Äôt know if that was the case for all quest items. 
---
That helm is so good for the level you can get it!
---
Big part of why I preferred BC dungeons over Wrath.
---
Took longer, were bigger and way harder.
---
At a certain point RHC became a joke, I managed to go from fresh 80 to like 3.7k GS by just spamming RHC with a buddy for 3 days
---
Did like 40 RHCs and got so much gear and eventually badges I was able to do Ulduar a week after hitting 80

Not taking a close look at random names... I should just kill myself. Or wait, I just ignore morons like you. That should do the trick as well
---
You'd make a good mod around here if only you were more aggressive. Gotta toss in a ", pleb." at the end of your sentence.
---
Nope... next couple months are going to be busy.
---
Playing through Ori and the Blind Forest right now. Got a new PoE league starting next week. FFXIV expansion at the end of next month. Mario Maker 2 next month. Also eyeing that new Total War game that just came out.
---
Even if all that doesn't occupy me, I still have Witcher 2 &amp; 3 + Hyrule Warriors sitting at the top of my backlog of games I really need to play through at some point. I have this preconceived notion of how I'm going to dislike Witcher combat, which has kept me from touching them &gt;.&gt;
---
Also been sitting on Spider-Man and the entirety of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Waiting for a good deal to grab those, which could happen during summer sales @_@;
---
30mg Adderall is pretty intense.  
---
Go for 15mg extended release.
---
That is how I feel about the 4 bitcoins I had on my first gaming PC my uncle built for me...
---
The healers in my leveling guild were aholes.  Dps, also aholes.  The rules are simple:
---
1) chain pull till the healer calls a break
---
2) if you don't pull fast enough the healer will pull
---
3) don't let the healer get hit. 
---
4) get fed gear
---
Rfc and wailing caverns were rough.  By the time we got to brd we were a well oiled machine in any combination of players or classes.
---
Rules were similar for dps on damage, right target, cc, dropping runners.
---
I really don't get some of the people on this board. For years everyone talked about the reason they preferred Vanilla over retail was they hated the "GOGOGO" mentality of retail where you could just charge into a giant pack of mobs with no priority targets and no CC and just aoe down the group and never talk to anyone in your group. 
---
Then the Beta comes out, and in the Beta not only do you not need to CC/prio target/talk to your group, with how little damage the dungeon mobs are doing you don't even really need a tank or healer (although without a healer it would probably be slower to stop and eat).
---
It isn't just "well people just sucked back then". If the damage is in fact correct (I haven't seen any evidence so far to convince me one way or the other), then it is the 1.12 talents that are trivializing the content and it should be rebalanced. They should be recreating the vanilla feel, not vanilla values.
---
Imo having the game die content wise is stupid and simply restarting it over and over again is even stupider.
---
If your point is to get a setup for a non-extensive task (running WoW classic is not an extensive task) then this IS the cheapest solution you can get, sorry.
---
You could, it was an interface option
---
If ever they do, it has to be on an entirely new server so that the advertised classic servers remain as is. Same goes for TBC/WotLK servers. Start fresh, leave original classic servers alone.
---
That's awesome that your mom raided with you
---
So saying something shouldn‚Äôt take 19 hours is me asking for everything to be easier? Cool
---
While I wouldn‚Äôt totally cheap out if you‚Äôre looking to build a rig, you don‚Äôt need a monster gaming rig to play it at all. I played vanilla on a piece of shit, total factory Compaq laptop from 2003.
---
dude no you still have to win. If you lost games you lost honor relative to everyone else
---
If you have mob density, duo is where it is at. Pref shaman but druid/priest works well too. Just buy your duo partner water.
---
Salt.
---
Prot pallies are fine as the 3rd raid tank. If not tanking, ,you become the dedicated rolling buff bitch.
---
But inherently it doesn't show you what it's about from the first moment... 
---
You have 1 ability, a racial, and your auto attack at level one. 
---
You don't get talents until level 10
---
You don't do a dungeon until level 15-20
---
You don't do a raid until 60
---
I enjoy every factor I just said, it's not a critique about those things, they are just examples of the fact that the game doesn't show you what it's about, well potentially, for days of time played.. 
---
By the time you get a full talent tree you have at least 50 - 60 hours sunk in 
---
I'm not asking to make it like retail, I don't want to pull 7 mobs and live at level 3 but I don't think level 3-5 mobs should have such high resist/dodge. 
---
Level 1-2 mobs tend to do less than 3 dmg per attack so that's not an issue you can miss 12 times and live , it's when you are level 4 and you have literally 2 abilities and the enemies hit for 12% of your hp while dodging or resisting 1/3 of your attacks ... It's not practical at that point in the game and it just wastes time. I'm not learning anything because all I'm doing is casting fireball repeatedly or watching my character auto attack and hope RNG swings in my favor... Sorry that is not skill . Level 6 or 8? Sure, I have a slow or a heal or something or at least a bit more natural stamina or even developed more weapon skill ...
---
If you fish up a cat in a bag then you certainly should let it out of the bag, but if you want the gold coins you shouldn't talk about the reel social club.
---
I didn't make up your post history. Nazi.
---
don't paladins get the epic speed mount in phase two?
---
Ok, you're really over-exaggerating how useful the buffs are. Alch is pretty OP in the early levels, but cooking isn't amazing or anything for leveling. 
---
If you don't want to level anything but first-aid, don't. Cooking isn't really that good for non-Warriors before endgame, especially if we don't have the mp5 fish in phase 1.
---
Healing potions are good, but that's common sense. Mid-strong leveling classes probably still won't even use them often.
---
You left out the bit about losing the match in the title.
---
hum... you weren'T supposed to use much more than 1 button as a healer in classic.
---
get that mid-30s heal rank, and spam it over and over.
---
on the few fight with AoE damage sure, you have your prayer of mending to use... and loatheb was a unique case... but if you were the weirdo with 6 different rank of 3 different spell on his bar, I'm sorry but you were the noob doing wrong.
---
Out of curiosity how is it to late?  Do you not think they will keep inviting people into the beta throughout June and July?
---
Ankhs aren't cheap but neither is Arcane Dust and Portal reagents but people still want em
---
I played on a bunch of private servers. A guild that goes with ~ 10 shadow priests / ret paladins / feral druids / enhance shamans is almost certainly going to struggle their first few weeks in MC.
---
You seem to be assuming that very experienced players go as a suboptimal spec because they want to overcome a self-imposed challenge. When in reality they don‚Äòt even really like healing.
---
Liar and a bigot.
---
Guild Wars 1 is one of my favorite games and I still play that.  Recently I bought a few more copies and now my kids are playing it.  It's been a shitload of fun adventuring with them and introducing them to different mechanics and coming up with their own builds.
---
I feel like you have no idea of what is going on related to classic wow development and are barging in here, doing no homework, trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist.
---
There's has been a ton of interview content to listen to the classic team talk about the vision they have for classic wow and how they are implementing it. The communication has been great and I think most of the community agrees that the execution of this project has been excellent and as they say "a love letter to our fans".
---
chill out everything is fine.
---
Not really accurate for either.
---
Never built one before, but sounds like I ought to give it a try!
---
Where did I say we don‚Äôt need any. I‚Äôm saying not all locks have to stack 40 ss In a raid. Also a good warlock won‚Äôt need to eat.
---
Played it for a long time years ago, unfortunately just can't go back to it
---
Well that world record is from live vanilla, not pservers. But yeah. Just take it all in!
---
Look at Mr. Fancy Life over here.
---
He wasn't saying you need engineering to clear the content. He was saying any serious guild would require you to take it.
---
Pretty please sir.
---
have they confirmed they're doing cross realm BGs?
---
You are correct, sorry if I wasn‚Äôt clear, but like you point out, the equipment API was there. 
---
Ignore the /equip thing, the macro API isn‚Äôt actually related to the game version, i.e. in Classic we‚Äôll be using the 8.0 Macro API, but anything that wasn‚Äôt backed in BlizzardUI hooks in 2006 wont be there in classic.
---
Not sustainable for most, sure.  That's the point of the cost in the first place.  To discourage constantly changing your spec.
---
There were definitely people back then forking over the 100g per week, but most only respecced occasionally.
---
For thoses who only played pservers, innervate used to be druid's 31 resto talent.
---
When blizz made it so you had to specialize in a spec and go 31 before going into the next tree is when I knew I would never come back to WoW.
---
Respecing and doing wild hybrid specs was one of my favorite things to do. Forcing us into 3 specialized buckets made me mad and ruined plenty of viable and even theory crafted "best" specs for situations. 
---
It was TBC but I remember going Demonic Sacrifice and the rest affliction for a fun lvling build where I'd sac my VW for health regen and then aoe farm with dots and Howl of Terror 3-5 mobs at a time. It was so much fun and it would be impossible when they forced ppl to go down one full tree.
---
same boat
---
Pretty much everyone else has covered this. Your dps will be very bad, mana issues will be a thing, and most serious guilds won't be throwing you an invite until the content is close to on farm. 
---
Also your tier sets are pretty abysmal from a dps perspective, so you'll be looking for melee offset pieces, which will probably get prioritized to literally any other melee dps first. 
---
The reality is an enh shaman in the raid is probably fine, but the general community mentality towards enhance is that they're bottom tier in usefulness.
---
Video replies were a good feature.
---
Even if this were true vanilla molten core speed runs would still be more entertaining than anything in BFA lmao
---
It's common with people whose language isn't english.
---
Dungeon finder is already in 1.12 in the form of meeting stones.
---
I thought all the hordies had to be a member of an alea iacta splinter guild??
---
I didn‚Äôt say change it to the way I liked it. I just said how I enjoyed playing it more when it took less time to finish it.
---
From what I remember the only time your race actually makes a big impact on what you do and how you play is if you're a priest.
---
That said forsaken cannibalize is useful but still.....
---
Oh sure, I just expect many people who want to go enh shaman from that video will be in for a bit of a rude awakening
---
I had the exact same encounter but in the stockades.  I had to be taught the concept of Taunting and defensive stance.  I literally didnt know what the purpose of Taunt was when i got it and was such a monumental scrub at the time that when i learned the skill, i literally thought it was a joke skill that no one ever used.   I had never touched an MMO up until wow in 2005.
---
So what you're saying is that you haven't given blizzard a cent since at latest 2010 (end of WOTLK). However, you have also been playing since 2005 and also everything from 2010 to 2019 is utter dog shit...
---
Speaking from experience about the recent expansions I see?
---
&gt;	And better class/spec balance
---
Oh fuck off with that shit.
---
The hunter class is really good. It just takes someone who knows how to play one to make it work. There is a reason the word huntard was used.
---
Legit philosophical questions tbh
---
I don‚Äôt mind nerfing something else so the total dmg stays the same. I just want at least one button to press
---
Possibly a stupid question...did you play for the full 19h?
---
Ah yes. The totem quests. Such fond memories
---
An addon that gives you 10x experience by exploiting the code that correlates between mobs and character received experience. ‚ÄúWhy even play classic if you want 10x experience‚Äù. Because bitch I said so.
---
Jk I don‚Äôt actually want that, just figured I‚Äôd have a conversation with myself about it. I‚Äôll see myself out. ‚úåüèª
---
To all those who want Dual spec, how much would you pay to unlock a second spec? When it first was intruduced it costed 1k gold, altho it was wrath so gold were worth less, but still a fair amount
---
Nothing else can kill wow, it has to do it itself
---
Actually 100% true, believe it or not. My armory has the proof, lol.
---
Not going to lie I'm sinking into depression with all the anticipation. I have tried so many games in the last few weeks and I can't manage to stay on them for more than 15 mins normally.
---
&gt; have you been sleeping below a rock for the past decade ?
---
have you been hit in the head with a rock, every day, for the past decade?
---
Who is gonna "fact check" blizzard.  Who is base truth?  Blizzard is base truth.  Who should we trust more than the people who actually have the data? And they've already looked into this.
---
Also, streamers are gonna be able to tank mobs way higher level than them because they've been working on BiS gearing at level 30.  Warriors use an axe from a quest that isn't supposed to be realistically completed until level 40+.
---
Lol yeah because enh is even decent. Enh was trash. If you couldn't kite an enh, then you belong on retail.
---
Very few AVs last that long or even close to that long. The point is if you can't/won't commit to something go do something else.
---
I haven't raided mythic content since ToS due to RL commitments and I'm unable to put in the time. Yet I'm not crying to Blizzard to make mythic content more "accessible". I accept the fact that right now I can't raid mythic content and stick to other things I can fit in my schedule.
---
This whole "I deserve to see and do everything" attitude is a major factor in WoW's decline. I get it's an unpopular fact and I'll continue to get down voted, but oh well. Some people are too soft to handle the truth.
---
No wtf?!
---
I wouldn't worry about the speed too much as long as you're havin fun, that's all that matters. 
---
I know a few of the private servers are super crowded right now making it hard to complete quests in a reasonable amount of time.
---
Horde has more and usually better players.
---
If you need shards how do you get them if not farming. That made no sense. A good warlock doesn't need to eat? In what scenario?
---
So how would you know if the latest expansions were good or not if you didn't play them?
---
or
---
How did you play them if you didn't pay a sub?
---
Mario Maker 2 coming out in a month. Really loved the first one I am happy I will have 2 months to focus on Mario before classic comes out.

It‚Äôs a scene from an anime called jojos bizarre adventure: golden wind. They are gang members. 
---
The meme itself is used to describe someone who is minding their own business but agrees with his comrades and then joins in.
---
 Idk if that‚Äôs an okay description or if I ruin it trying to explain. The anime is kind of weird but gets better over time. So I‚Äôd understand if it went over lots of ppls heads.
---
True, my statement was broad. What I'm trying to get at though is that the core mechanics of and tone of the game should be set early. You should see resists, dodges, parries, misses often enough to know that these mechanics are important. That when you do hit level 10 you'll already know the importance of either increasing those stats, or going for talents that reduce them in your enemy. You'll have had bad enough RNG to know that even \*one\* mob can give you a hard time, making you cautious as you move on. So even if you aren't pulling 7 mobs in the starting zone, you should still understand the danger of a single mob, and not suddenly experience a shift in how the threatening the mobs are when you are in much more dangerous areas. I knew before I reached Fargodeep Mines that having mobs that close together with a real aggro radius was going to require careful approaches. If you set a new players expectations that it \*won't\* be that bad they could get equally get frustrated with the change in difficulty after they had gotten used to the starting zone. 
---
Things don't have to be skill either. I didn't need personal skill to play FF7, but that's just the type of gameplay RPG players look for sometimes.
---
Retail is dead.  I really hope they actually care and try with this opportunity.
---
There is no argument, Alliance is best.

Enjoy your mud huts and ugly women.

No, stop lying about racism you desperate nerd.

You're doing it right now because you're mad that I said something about your game? Get a life, you racist pos

Yes they have. It‚Äôs already in the beta.

Massive decline in Subscription numbers.

It's not rocket science, man.
---
&gt; the skill level difference compared to today isnt going to magically save you for taking crushing blows that eat a 3rd of your hp away.
---
No, but spending hours at soft-capped level 30 farming BiS gear will make quite the difference...
---
Absolutely NE for battlegrounds if you care enough about winning to play defensively. Shadowmeld is a massive force multiplier. 
---
More mobile playstyles dwarf might have the edge.
---
I vaguely recall that there are rep requirements or crafting requirements or something that will push back the first clear.
---
Upvote for use of Gravity Falls.
---
That's just every vanilla pvp video though with few duel exceptions lol
---
I dont get the downvoting here.  I want to avoid being on servers where streamers are.  It's already silly that people can make a living off of streaming, but to have their follower sheeples _also_ play the fucking game for them to elevate the streamer even more isn't something I'm interested in being around.
---
What ever happened to people just playing games to play games and have fun?
---
I quit before dual spec was introduced, but it seems like a solid addition. If people are worried about balance, there are plenty of ways to restrict it so that it doesn't go overboard. Have it be a lvl 60 unlock, requires a long quest chain and couple hundred gold to unlock.
---
You could even set the 2nd spec to only be active while in a battleground. Or toss a long cooldown on it, like 48 hrs.
---
It would make it a lot less painful to play a spec like ret paladin.
---
it wasn't only about balance.
---
it was about being able to enjoy different style of gameplay, being able to PvP and PvE without ruining yourself, or heck, allowing your super-raid geared healer to kill a mob slightly faster than he did when he was a fresh 60...
---
Thank you, this was the first video where I have seen any.
---
The fuck are you talking about. Back to retail with you

You'll easily kill 100 mobs in the barrens. Probably way more. And if you're not lucky enough to find it, it drops often enough that it's usually a pretty cheap recipe.
---
They've said they're pretty much done with invites, they have enough population already.
---
The general consensus is that Nelf is better because you can stealth yourself and your pet. 
---
Dwarf is only good against rogues which you already hardcounter.
---
I actually forgot that Swiftmend replaced it at some point and Innervate became baseline.
---
Whats with this beta lasting forever?  Why let people play at lvl 30 so long?  Just get it over with already so there's at least an ounce of hype left for the real thing.
---
This is how I picture Bobby b.
---
Hi, /u/Khelgor
---
If i remember right they have to rebuild it. Sure they have some stuff to work from but they are recreating something that is long gone. If a cook makes a stew that was made using a roast and people decide they want a roast so the cook makes a roast would you say he didn't cook that roast because there used to be a roast before it was made into stew?
---
maybe not the best analogy but still.
---
Exactly the same here, I normally have such an easy time having fun while gaming but lately I'm getting so much enjoyment watching streamers do the most simple things in classic. I've watched probably every classic video on YouTube at this point and I'm watching vod highlights all the time. My body is so ready for this game to come out.
---
We're planning a week one Rag kill. Ony might be a little harder.
---
I think speedrunning is going to be a much bigger thing in Classic than it is in Retail.
---
this is classic vanilla behaviour, wtf are you guys even talking about? this is how it is supposed to be.
---
They could go the GW2 path and introduce horizontal progression with old expansions.
---
So all the expansions give different perks that are skippable for people who just want to max gear and raid.
---
You think you do, but you don't
---
Most people will be end game raiders.
---
Achievements. I think they're really motivating for exploring typically ignored content.
---
exactly!
---
Been strongly considering this. I've never really been able to make myself get into total war games though with the step learning curve, but I really like the setting of this one and it looks like a lot of fun.
---
yet ever since they added talent / unlimited respec there's 10X more strategy in every PvE boss and PvP comp... because they don't have to care about those going half and half.
---
Go play current wow if you want it to be like current wow. Dont come in here judging people who want different things.
---
Is this non buzzword enough for you?
---
Dont like it, dont play it.
---
You dont go into a restaurant and demand they remove everything you dont like on the menu right? You either eat there and order something you like (play classic and dont play AV) or you dont eat there at all and you leave (dont play classic).
---
Dont ruin other people's enjoyment just because you dont see how they can possibly like something you dont.
---
they were abused by people pretty hard it was always some crazy woman trying to piggyback of the op's video
---
a reply with no views would be directly displayed under or next to any video they replied to so it just got abused hard
---
That's not hotkeys, barring the 1 through = bar. The numbers in the bottom right are stack count not hotkey.
---
What I'm trying to say is we've got a clicker here bois.
---
It's not a dumb question, yes you can do that. I believe only Night elves got faster death speed.
---
Yup. I personally know he was working as not intended right up to the BC prepatch at the very least, but I never played my Hunter alt again after BC launched, so I'm not sure when they did fix him.
---
[You sure about that?](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brwu8f/waitin_for_the_boat/)
---
Those gnomes and countless other characters headed en masse to Silithus. Tanaris was a battleground where horde and alliance met on their way.
---
Guild Wars 2 is basically a Theme Park MMO and it handles expansions very differently.
---
You don't get extra levels, but you unlock new talent trees and you get interest new abilities(IE one expansion focuses on gliders, which are incredibly fun). The old content isn't necessary, but its definitely worth doing.
---
&gt; I raided up to Aq40 with my "resto" druid except I was 30 Feral 21 Resto. No one knew and it was tons of fun in pvp. 
---
Those poor priests not having an Innervate available.
---
yeah hair matching sets looks great
---
Degrees of quality matter.
---
Crying hell and damnation because the word "Hottie" is used somewhere next to a badly drawn cartoon figure, is unwarranted and overreacting. Equaling that to the suffering of minorities in the 50s is absurd.
---
And this is the last I will say about the topic, because this is really not the /r for such discussions.
---
Achievements and anything that saves on bag or bank space.
---
BUFF THE DAMAGE BLIZZ.
---
mana drain? you must have a weird memory then ... that was not a thing for shadow priests
---
You should be ranking up arcane missiles if you do any PvP. It's one of the abilities you use when people are jumping in and out of LOS.
---
LimeWire PRO, omg
---
Limewire! The quickest way to get a virus back in the day.
---
Worse than that: People have weird patterns of behavior that are the opposite of perfectly random, leading to demand spikes!
---
I know they did in Durotar
---
Even amplify is good for those starting dungeons. You can get by without it tho.
---
They will ruin Horde BGs.
---
That too.
---
Damn you right tho lol
---
It's just one basic move. Not like it will completely change the balance of the class, it would just make retribution a little bit better
---
Dude, people aren't saying it's sexist because of the word "Hottie".
---
&gt;It also sucks because it encourages doing the same content over and over. It used to be you had multiple raids per tier, now you have one raid with multiple difficulties. This ruins immersion for me. I loved the idea of ok we got geared enough thru Kara, and have enough guildies now, to get into gruuls lair. I hate this new idea of we clear normal the first week, spend a few weeks on heroic, now we can progress through mythic. It just gets so old.
---
So to summarise this paragraph:
---
It sucks having to do the same content over and over, I loved the idea of doing the same content over and over. I hate the new idea of doing the same content over and over.
---
Ok I see your point like you can't ignore leveling weapon skill because if you don't you'll miss and parry all your attacks like it sets the tone like you said and I'd definitely agree.
---
Wow isn't supposed to be "easy" , really, ever throughout the story. Early it should be simple and encouraging enough for someone who's never heard of or played wow to do fine, though, and I think that of any game.
---
The taskbar is unlocked and it's triggering me
---
I subbed and I got into the stress test so already that 15 dollars was well spent. 
---
I have a friend who has had an active subscription since wotlk and he didnt get beta or stress test. 
---
It is all luck it would seem. 
---
If you can afford 15 dollars why not take a gamble.
---
**Obnoxious Min/Max‚Äôers:**
---
You can‚Äôt bring more than 1 or 2 Druid‚Äôs or Hunters because they‚Äôre not ideal.  
---
**Also Obnoxious Min/Max‚Äôers:**
---
Vanilla wow content is trivial; we‚Äôll full clear every raid in 30 minutes the day it‚Äôs released with 25-30 people
---
That‚Äôs a great point. Lot of (deserved) shit slinging towards Blizz but the way they‚Äôre handling Classic feels like a step in the right direction.
---
Honestly I have never gone with Engi myself. I know its *the* PvP prof, but how does it help in PvE?
---
I'm considering it when Classic comes instead of my usual tailor/enchant.
---
&gt;An Armory scraper would have to go through RIDICULOUS amounts of requests to be even remotely reliable.  
---
&gt; So no, an Armory scraper won't be a thing. Wasn't back then either, even though it's technically easy enough to implement. 
---
For the sake of argument, scraping armory pages was how simulationcraft and sites like wowprogress worked for years (at least until [2011](https://www.wowprogress.com/post/66_US_Armory_partially_broken)). 
---
&gt; If I have to inspect someone to keep my "score" of him up to date, then the Addon is useless, or rather, what it does is redundant.  
---
I haven't had time (or beta access T.T) to look into exactly what the addon API they're using is, but if it's retail's, addons can inspect on mouseover.  This reduces the player burden to zero, since the addon is essentially just updating passively in the background.  And you're right, this is less useful for people you've known and grouped with, but is much more helpful for a person who you've never met later in the expansion.  You would be able to easily see he's ZG geared if you inspected him, but the addon would also be able to tell you he's fully MC and BWL progressed as well as 5/6 ZG.  Instantly on a mouseover window.  Whether or not you find that information useful is another thing entirely. 
---
Ultimately though, you're right and this is nowhere close to the level that [raider.io](https://raider.io) is in retail.  I'm mostly playing devil's advocate.
---
Not wasting my time this go around. 4 hours of wasted login attempts was my contribution to stress test city.
---
Easiest way is to use Ice Barrier or Mana Shield :D
---
Haha I think that is the best analogy I‚Äôve heard
---
What a strange post. Small time streamers are cashing in hard because of the Classic hype and are having the time of their lives.
---
PREACH! I like this idea. Or have the CD reset with the weekly instance reset
---
I'll be honest, I never went in there!
---
Lol no. A good priest might get away with using 4-5 healing spells only for most of the time. But even if we disregard downranking, a priest has
---
- shields
---
- renews
---
- heal/greater heal
---
- flash heal
---
- prayer of healing
---
- holy nova
---
Good and experienced priests use 2-3 renews, 2-4 flash heals and easily 3-5 slow heals (at like 1000, 1400, 1800, 2500 and max rank heals).
---
Heck, I know a lot of people who have lesser heals ready to go before gear starts kicking in.
---
A lot of priests only ever use flash heals. Almost all of those are bad because the heal - while being a good jack of all trades in strong guilds especially during MC - is not optimal on its own. There are just too many opportunities for renews, or a bunch of slow heals when predicting high damage. The best healers will sync their cast bar with the enemy swing timer.
---
Source: More than a year of playtime on multiple priests. Granted, priest is one end of the extreme, whereas a class like paladin is the other extreme (but even those should have their slow heals at hand). I know a lot of Shamans try to cheese healing meters with chain heals but good Shamans twist totems per GCD and have both healing waves available (until they go crazy and quit).
---
I think you are mixing up Loatheb. Every healer can only use a single heal in that fight and it will be their biggest and slowest heal (the one priests use after inner focus).
---
I personally don't want to play the beta or a private server before Classic launches.  While I don't think I would get burned out, I do want to experience it as fresh as I can when it launches and know that the past few months aren't going to be reset or lost.
---
I love Asmongold, but thank you for the knowledge.
---
How is that possible? The world record to hit 60 is 4 days 20 hours. So you're going to get 40 people to hit world record pace which is 5 days played within 7 days.. not gonna happen.
---
Like many others, I got back into Warcraft 3. Just started the undead campaign. I picked up Minecraft again, too. The last time I played it was almost 10 years ago, and I've actually been loving it. It's meditative and simple and any game that lets you zone out to a favorite podcast while doing something simple and repetitive  like strip mining is a winner in my book. I can't wait to do the same while grinding mobs in Classic.
---
Oh okay cool. I see "woke" and I assume the worst these days :P
---
kek
---
Make your new home in Stormwind :)
---
I am invited to the beta but am not really playing it, it's like playing a private server for me outside testing stuff it's characters you ultimately throw away
---
I think I understand what you guys were trying to argue now. I thought you guys were trying to say that Stabbers's ping wouldn't be a factor in a situation where leeway is being given, which is pretty clearly false to me. But there is of course no reason to make that argument, and you're just trying to say that in the Vanilla system (which Beta should be made closer to, according to you guys), the chaser's ping shouldn't be a factor in how far away he is able to auto from.
---
Is that correct? I agree with that, if so.
---
LoL! "Wrong" opinions! Dude, opinions by definition can't be wrong. You just don't agree with me and that's fair. Also, unsubstantiated claim ("people like you are reason retail wow is where it's at currently"). Move along.
---
Yikes... When I was younger I would have gotten a bunch of sodas, but I know better now: lots of water, black tea to stay awake, and good meals well spread, that's how you stay awake and sharp.
---

That depends on the amount, for both.
---
why are you stalking his post history? lol
---
I should have clarified when I said "Solo" min maxers... I was referring to people who aren't in organized raiding guilds with progression gearing strategy in mind. Casual players who probably aren't going to be clearing current patch raids every week, but more sporadic and focusing on easier prior phase raids. 
---
A lot of these people are coming from retail where you can find nicely organized web page specifically for your class and spec to get best stat prioritization, enchants, spec builds, etc. Basically bis map for how to prioritize your cookie cutter character. 
---
This works really easy for casual and hardcore players alike because it doesn't take but a fraction of the time and energy as it did back in vanilla to get gear. Back then you just kinda got what you got in any given month and hoped it worked with your build. A lot of people even respec'd around gear (more significantly around 1h/2h melee specs) or even simply around weapon specializations. 
---
If you were a weekly raider in an organized group, you'd have an easier chance of reliabily getting gear that you wanted in a reasonable time frame.
---
&gt;I'm mostly playing devil's advocate.
---
And a good thing you do, because discussions don't go anywhere with people only agreeing with each other.
---
Or Void elf? üòÑ
---
TBH, no one other than a shaman or pally should ever use it. Warriors should be using swords or nightfall for 2h (with the exception of MoM from KT) or be dual wield fury.
---
God*
---
I believe I am playing on the same one. Everywhere is crowded and it really feels alive
---
Lmao, you guys are so insecure. I come in here and tell you the truth and you get so butthurt. 
---
I never said it shouldn't be like current wow only that you guys are crazy for thinking that someone you should be using a 19 hour BG for gatekeeping to keep people from playing the game. 
---
If that's truly how you feel then I feel sorry for your basement dwelling ass that thinks that way. I hope classic succeeds for the sake of gaming but many you idiots make it real easy to see that if your attitude doesn't change then most people are gonna be turned off. 
---
You must be one real shitty person with a worse attitude where you feel like you gotta bash people for not wanting to no life something as simple and easy as an AV. 
---
I hope you get help
---
And even then at higher levels you get the random ones that revert back to being all tiny and even if they have better stats I just remember thanking Blizzard for giving us the option to hide cloaks.
---
Oh I know, not gonna.  Def not worth it.  I'll just wait.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; All of the information I've seen so far has not debunked anything I've questioned which is why I have the questions.
---
Blizzard literally saying that they have an internal build of 1.12 and that they have compared the numbers and they are EXACTLY the same is not debunked for you?
---
And the link I posted had the dev blog in it.
---
&gt;  and if they have released information which supersedes my information I'm happy to update my knowledge.
---
They have. I just told you this. at this point you are going out of your way to be dismissive of irrefutable evidence while continuosly saying "I'm happy to update my knowledge"
---
Your knowledge is out of date. They have an internal build of 1.12. They used said build to compare the numbers. The numbers are perfect. 
---
Additionally, your knowledge that they never had the original source code is wrong.
---
https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-classic-gameplay-vanilla-wow-server
---
&gt; We had the original 1.12 client and server and data. But they were designed to run on hardware that hasn‚Äôt existed for a long time, in an overall tech stack and part of a broader Blizzard infrastructure that hasn‚Äôt existed for a long time.
---
I cannot be more clear: You are simply wrong. No "it is possible" about it. You have approached conspiracy levels of dismissal of facts and I am really regretting bringing you up to speed. next time tell people you won't listen to reason or evidence before you pretend to have questions.
---
She watched me giving WoW a whirl and was interested, but we both know she won‚Äôt be able to do the things I was doing with the mouse/keyboard so we were looking for some suitable options for her. 
---
I‚Äôll add that I made this thread after she and I couldn‚Äôt decide what class she‚Äôd enjoy the most, and she had indicated she wanted to choose one of the easiest roles
---
I didn't try it in vanilla, but I have a lot of experience playing spriest in TBC and it was very fun. I was always extremely valuable to my guild and remember groups fighting over me. My DPS was pretty damn good by the time I got to BT.
---
My cousin leveled a rogue, I leveled a night elf druid and was doing one half of the aquatic form quest (where you have to go to the top of darkshore) and killed the threshadons while I was there. What dropped? [A sweet dagger](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=5516), it's just a shitty grey item but to my cousin (who had hit level 10 and got dual wield) it had twice the damage compared to one of his daggers, so it was quite an upgrade.
---
Another moment is in Stranglethorn Vale. You can go to the Nesingwary camp and do those quests at level 29 (which is the lowest level to start questing in STV), but my cousin couldn't solo the tigers. So when I had to go do something, he'd have to either wait or go back to Duskwood. LUCKILY a high-level priest (can't remember if level 60, but at least higher level than us) gave him PW: Fortitude, which gave him JUST enough health to survive the tigers, allowing him to continue smacking around tigers on his own while I was gone for a bit.
---
If they do a TBC server make it brand new with no character continuation.
---
Remove flying but provide quests to grant new flight paths to the areas that require flying such as elemental plateau or Netherwing Ridge.
---
Blade's Edge dailies need to be reworked, I think there were some flying missions.
---
I'm okay with heroic versions of dungeons, but also create level 70 heroics of vanilla dungeons so the content doesn't become obsolete
---
They can add in a lot of changes programmatically without having to create new zones or content. New spells in professions would not be that hard either.
---
If your end goal is as simple as getting 60 and killing Rag you're still quitting too early.
---
he plans to manipulate time itself
---
Whats the worst part of sharding for you? For me its breaking up the server community, which layering still does.

Mages. The masterclass :D
---
Well, it's a strategy game. That's like saying you maxed out starcraft after beating the campaign.
---
I can see some aspects of current as a mobile thing. The mission tables. In fact I think either it was or it was talked about being made into one during warlords of draenor. I could but wrong but it sounds right.....
---
I don't think you should have any trouble running this game with pretty much any computer from the last decade.
---
I will bet that the game runs at 60 FPS easy on integrated graphics if you use the "classic" graphics mode.
---
that $500 build linked above will laugh when you throw classic wow at it.

All my hype and time investment is being saved up for the day it's released.

**&lt;Heralds of Norgannon&gt; | US-PST | RP-PvE | Horde | Social &amp; Raiding Focused**
---
--------------------------
---
**About Us**
---
&lt;Heralds of Norgannon&gt; was founded by Players who are getting older and want a more relaxed, community focused atmosphere. We have jobs, families, and other commitments that prevent spending large amounts of time online, so we need to make the most of that time. To that end our focus is on both Raiding (Non-Hardcore) and Player-Driven Content such as Roleplaying, in-game events/contests, and so on.
---
Tues/Thurs - 7PM-10PM PST
---
Optional Raid Night: Saturdays - 7-10PM PST
---
Loot Rules: Loot Council with Transparency
---
**Why Softcore Raiding?**
---
Vanilla Raids have been cleared uncountable times for over a decade and few titles have reached the level of optimization for both Player and Raid performance that Vanilla has. With that in mind we do not consider Raids to be the end all be all content that they are on live, instead they are part of what makes the game enjoyable. Raids are one part of what makes WoW Classic great and while we're excited to experience that content but it isn't the end all be all.
---
**Roleplayers**
---
We plan on having Roleplayers as a significant portion of our Guild because Roleplaying is an endless source of content. We will have regular RP Events and Contests once everyone has settled into the game, these will also be open to anyone on the Server as part of our Community focus.
---
We are not out to alienate those who are not fans of RP. Roleplaying will take place in its own channels and will not be part of our Raids, there is also no requirement to take part in Roleplaying if you don't want to. We offer it as a source of content and an outlet for Players who enjoy it, not something to be forced on everyone.
---
**Requirements**
---
* Willing to play on an RP-PVE Server
---
* Be social and willing to view WoW Classic as a Journey, not just a Destination
---
Please check out our website at https://norgannon.enjin.com/

What was the big impact of races on Priests?

Really stupid question - how do you know if you‚Äôve been invited to beta?

EU?

Which is true.... MAXED that shit RIGHT OUT. Easymode.
---
I am not choosing her class for her, I am looking for information to give her including seasoned players thoughts on difficulty. I made this thread after her indicating she wasn‚Äôt sure which class she‚Äôd have the most success with. We will be playing together!
---
Riding isn't a secondary profession in Classic, it's in your spellbook. Each race has a different training you'll need to use their mounts.
---
Assuming Exalted and Rank 3 PVP:
---
Both factions: 4 Training = 64g
---
Alliance: 14 Blue Mounts = 896g
---
Alliance: 12 Epic Mounts = 9,600g
---
Horde: 11 Blue Mounts = 704g
---
Horde: 11 Epic Mounts = 8,800g
---
Alliance total: 10,560g
---
Horde total: 9,568g
---
Lots of these abilites most certainly have uses, but not big enough to warrant the gold fee, at least not until you got mount.
---
It's almost like some people can enjoy things differently than you.
---
I wouldnt mind this but maybe with some sort of cool down for use? Maybe 1 visit per week/month?
---
I disagree; It's an issue with the entire gaming community. The obsession with optimizing your play at the expense of everything else, even in non-competitive games, is everywhere now. I hate it.
---
that recipe sold for over 100g on most servers back then. Some servers even had prices for 400g.
---
besides killing 100 mobs does not give you a very good chance (about 9.5% in the best case) to drop it.
---
This, idk who he or his mate try to do this.
---
Our guilds Goal is to clear MC in the first 3 weeks, wich is somewhat reasonable i think.
---
Yes, leveling together!
---
Like I said these abilites are not useless, just very limited use.
---
The easiest way to not get dazed by a mob, is to crush it, see it driven before you, and hear the lamentations of its woman.
---
&gt;for the smaller streamers who are trying to make it big off of classic.
---
Any examples? I've never heard of 'any' streamer making it big off of any one game or in-game event. Of the known streamers that I follow, they either play whatever, or have a specific niche that they enjoy that they would probably still play even if they didn't stream.
---
I became less hyped for Classic once I found the City of Heroes rogue servers. That hits my nostalgia more than Classic. I'm living in Paragon City now.
---
This thread is the exact reason the game became what it is.
---
There's a big difference in committing to something that may never end and something that may take an hour to complete. One of those is reasonable and one of those will only drive players away. 
---
That's all Im arguing. No where am I saying that people should be given free access to the hardest content in the game. I am merely saying providing some restrictions is overall better for the health of the game. 
---
Especially when something like AV isn't difficult. Anyone can AFK and farm honor all fucking day. Its not even close to being the same level as mythic raiding and to compare the 2 in an effort to demean people who wanna play is pretty fucked up. 
---
If you guys can't see that then you're delusional.
---
Warlocks and Spriest are absolutely terrifying in pvp once they get gear. Biggest issue with shadow early on is gearing. Most guilds back then would only bring 1 shadow priest to raids purely for shadow weaving and even then you'd have to fight warlocks for gear.
---
&gt;I mean do you realize there are private servers out there? 
---
Ofcourse, it's how I actually started playing wow in 2004 until i managed to get money to buy it in january 2006 and I've been there a few times after that, for nostalgia. I don't like re-doing everything again, tho. It's nice reliving old things, but putting months grinding reputation/farming that piece of gear/clearing MC/BWL for 30th time just to progress further is not something I would ever enjoy doing again (let alone have the logistics/time anymore); let alone spending 3 hours clearing a dungeon.
---
What strikes me is that the "BfA is the worst expansion" meta we had it everywhere with Legion too - farming AP is shit, worst xpac, legendaries suck, worst xpac, WQs are just daily quests, worst xpac - and a dozens more reasons that Legion was worst xpac, it was all the meta for months --- then soon after BfA release, everyone switched to the "Legion was best xpac in years"; we already had it before with MoP (I mean man, what a ton of shit that xpac got from everyone everywhere - and I genuinely liked it and I miss it) and ofcourse WoD too. So every new xpac is the worst, but the newer xpac automatically makes the previous one "way better", this keeps repeating in like the past 10 years, but it seems that not many are acknowledging this is how **we** perceive it.
---
Oh, yes, there were Hoggers--but only after a server restart, and even then players got through. I was questioning the wrangled part, not the Hoggers. :-)
---
Shadowmeld is very useful in duels as well. Scatter &gt; trap &gt; run &gt; shadowmeld/drink  
---
Even if they knew where you went, they have to get right up on you just to break your drink unless they have a ranged AOE and most people aren't going to blow a grenade for it.
---
Is shadow remains still top guild in horde there? I played alliance on ER from 2006-2011
---
Yeah I‚Äôm going to be playing a healer to make things easier but she wants to get a character that will be super easy to play
---
It'll happen. World record pace was 4d20h when there was 4 people in the world trying to level quickly and didn't know what they're doing. Get enough try hards together and I think you'll get a whole guild dinging 60 in under 4d 10h, so 6 days fairly comfortably with sleep every night. That gives you one day to get consumables/rep/attunements/gear and have time for a proper MC raid.
---
Clearly this needed to be shared with everyone.
---
A game intended for fun that's not meant to be taken too seriously?
---
You are going to play 18-20 hours per day oof... that's gonna be tough.
---
You just need like 8? Ish people for honored hydraxian for a dose I believe. If people played literally 24/7 or shared accounts it'd be doable
---
No, frequent and never respec are not binary, there is balance where the core pillar is not broken, I find that balance to be 25g.
---
k kool no source
---
hes got heirloom gear duh
---
Raiding as any healer is very similar though. Every healer has several spells with cool niche uses, but the most efficient heal is used the vast majority of the time (Healing Touch, Flash of Light, Greater Heal, Chain Heal).

Seeing people not on your realm is the worst part to me, by far.
---
Now let me ask you, how does it break up the server community?
---
I hope they keep it up and bring back true classic WoW. 
---
The fact that they guy who said "You think you want it.. but you don't" is now running blizzard is worrying.  How long until he decides to fuck it up? I truly hope they ban him from having any input on Classic. He's done enough to ruin Blizzard already.
---
Hah look at this guy with his fancy computer that wouldn't die when doing AV... but jokes aside this is pretty cool, 3600 HKs!

When I played vanilla I could get at best 5 frames per second in AV so I never did it ;\_;

You have to douse the flames at each boss, but IIRC it's not too difficult to get the one time use items to do it. It's been a long time since I cleared MC.
---
^this, I like being able to change my appearance.
---
Same could be said about someone who thinks something should be changed just because they dont like how it is. How self centered does one have to be to think something should be changed drastically just to cater to them.
---
Mainly just want his weird face off my recommended.
---
Even after Korrak left, the games were still long. After the removal of several npcs at the tail end of vanilla they got faster.
---
IIRC, viper sting was a TBC ability. I rolled an orc hunter at the end of vanilla and he ended up being my alt at the beginning of TBC and eventually became my main later on in the expansion. My memory could be off though, that was a long time ago.
---
I remember my first journey to Duskwood on my dwarf hunter way back in 2004.  My 14 year old self was actually genuinely creeped out with the music and appearance of everything.  Such a super intriguing place.  Can't wait to get killed by Stitches again because /afk on the road to grab a beer/food.

EU - Alliance - PvP/PvE - As hardcore as my job will allow
---
Hi guys, I'm another 2004 player who's been taken over by the Classic hype. Wondering if there's a friendly, mature, primarily English speaking guild that I can join. I'll be playing a lot on release and it will be around the normal out of work times (though I won't lie I've booked some holiday for release to get stuck in). Looking forward to playing all content including PvP at 60.
---
I've played all expansions but nothing has quite beaten the vanilla gameplay. I like a challenge and am eager to tear up some kobald with either Warlock or Mage (I hear warrior will likely be widely picked though that's been my main for most of WoW). Though I'm happy to fill a role if we're missing a certain class, the general 'guide to what class to pick' YouTube vids have me excited to roll any of them!
---
So it will be great to meet some like minded individuals and start WoW classic on the right foot!
---
I will do a grey quest in beta tonight and check to be sure, but I'm fairly certain I got 100% rep for a grey quest in the beta earlier. Which I believe is NOT working correctly.  
---
I'm working from memory but I'm pretty sure there was a grey quest rep scale that reduced the amount you got.

---
I‚Äôve heard anecdotal evidence that death knights were tested in early stages of the game, which made things such as ‚Äúshadow damage‚Äù on the certain green shields (that were still in Vanilla) make sense. I believe that warlocks at one point were also going to use leather, and paladins were going to use ‚Äútarges‚Äù (think Diablo as an inspiration).
---
As a lock, in everything other than the PUG's that were raiding towards the end of Vanilla, a lot of your primary responsibilities that your group would demand of you required copious amounts of soulshards. Summoning players, making healthstones, soulstoning the designated person. A lot of the time in raids it might be a struggle to get shards back as you move along so if you didnt bring enough you would wind up being unable to do your job. Not just top end guilds, if you were a raiding warlock AT ALL, you needed to farm up shards before a raid.
---
If you aoe farm the rep it takes like 4 hours and you can do it while leveling.
---
Lol is that Joe Biden in a nuns outfit trying to poke an underage cheerleader? Man 2004 was truly ahead of its time
---
I really would love to just see a mock up version of TBC class balance and trees modded to fit a level 60 cap. I'm ok with it not being in the game, but I think TBC did so much for class balance that I'm just curious to see what theories would be made on how to mimic that on a level 60 scale. Maybe for a future 1.13 patch if Blizz ever goes that route to add more content to classic (I HIGHLY doubt we'll get 1.13+ patch content but I like to dream)
---
So obviously you couldn‚Äôt appreciate the jest in my first sentence. My bad. 
---
You really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a valid claim, are you kidding? The lazy mentality of *‚Äòoh why not just click a button without any human interaction*‚Äô is what made the game a goddamn Call Of Duty lobby, where you just press a button and poof there is your minigame for you. Were you around when these changes were made? Do you know why they were? Because people like you asked for it. And then you asked for it some more and now it snowballed into the ghost of an MMO we have today. Classic is prolly not for you, man, so why don‚Äôt you move along.
---
I would like a word with TBC.
---
* Flying mounts killing world PvP
---
* Resilience and Arenas killing BGs
---
* Ridiculously balanced Raids killing servers worth of guilds
---
* Spaceships and Lazers
---
* Retconning the entire Backstory of the burning Legion to fit in Tentacle-Face-Dudes and Floating BlingBlings
---
* Loss of faction identity (Pallys and Shamys for EVERYOOOOONE!)
---
* Downsized raids
---
* The crap that was Mount Hyjal
---
* Daily Quests
---
* Reputation Grinds
---
* Wellfare-Epics
---
A lot of the crap that later got worse, started out in TBC. Making Grand Marshal/High Warlord Gear accessible to everyone in the prepatch, was the Original Sin that started the downfall.
---
It definitely contributed in that way. Went from imbalanced 10m or world pvp to refining everyone around 2,3,5's
---
Yeah, I belive we managed to call in reinforcements and summon the Ice lord before victory in AV (even after mass removal of npcs).
---
Holy shit this is awesome. I remember downloading this of FP too, as well as all the original counter strike updates before it sold off to Valve. Ahhh the good ol days.
---
It's easier if you just kill the mob before you run away from it.
---
Nah it was in vanilla too.

I know right, fellow eu ring here :)
---
After this stress test, blizzard should open up the beta for everyone.
---
Oh, didnt know that honestly. You'd still be pretty tight on time overall though
---
It really wouldn't surprise me if the next wow xpac gameplay is a basterdized / hybrid of classic and BFA. 
---
Get some of the amazing classic features and mix it with modern casual base. Like talents, class quests, LFD, etc. Instead of level 130. Maybe go to 40... Who knows.
---
I kinda wanna ask /r/WhyWhereTheyFilming
---
I avoid STV like the plague until at least 37-38 to make it more tolerable.  I have not seen really any disruption in my leveling speed by just doing the other interchangeable zones.
---
Again, like the guy said, if you couldn't blaze through dungeons, this expectation would not be there.
---
If all pulls had to be slow, deliberate, and involve heavy CC, people wouldn't have the expectation of rushing through the dungeon. But since they do not, the expectation is that you are able to rush through the content as quickly as you can run. And if you can't keep up, you are a 'noob' or 'bad'.
---
&gt;no pandas
---
pandas bad but cows are good, right?
---
I don't think what you're suggesting is reasonable. For actual significant story content, you're going to have to sell expansion packs. I don't think most people would be on board with Classic selling expansion packs.
---
Back on retail launch I had hopes Paladins being the same as Diablo 2 ones

Lmao, keep digging that elitist hole man. I am sure you're a god on whatever private server you played on despite never actually playing classic when it was live.

---
My face when i got this q yesterday. And then Ashenvale.
---
That's something I've always loved about Vanilla. As you go from fighting pirates and murlocs in westfall to searing gorge and all the elementals and dragons to the plaguelands full of liches and zombie warriors it really felt like you were progressing your lowly adventure to higher and higher challenges. 
---
Especially BRM while leveling. It's almost like Mount Doom.
---
You just made my day sir :D
---
\*laughs in Dwarf\* 
---
So glad we can just climb up the mountain by Gnomeregan and save 30-45 minutes to Menethil Harbor.
---
Yeah pretty much. The clips that were posted here clearly show there's some type of leeway being added to the system.
---
From just the clips it looks like as long as the runner is running away from the chaser, then the chaser gets x yards added to his melee range.
---
4d20h is Joana who is known for perfecting fast leveling, it wasn't some rando at Vanilla Launch lol.
---
Blizzard has some splaining to do.
---
Versatility is actually a druid's strength IMO. I generally play this spec: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0pcxhMxRLZVecoco](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0pcxhMxRLZVecoco). Great balance world PvP / farming spec that is perfectly fine to raid heal with. Balance raid dps is a joke, but one of the best open world pvp classes.
---
Another common hybrid spec is this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZVMhoZVxfoeqzo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZVMhoZVxfoeqzo). This is a flag carrying spec that you can raid heal with. Not as great for farming, but I used this to raid heal and grind honor through mc / ony / bwl tiers and had a blast.
---
Toys.  Well, specifically, one toy.  I really hate having to equip the Piccolo as a trinket and wait for the cool down before I can make people dance.
---
Hey, gotta get that skill level up somehow!
---
It really whips the llama's ass.
---
Taking the release week off work to grind out like 12 hours at least a day in leveling. Hoping to hit 60 within 2 weeks tops then will flip to skinning devilsaurs and crafting the 2 BIS to sell for gold to get my epic mount/have available funds as needed for raiding. Then will grind dungeons to get what BIS I can get prior to Onyxia attunement and raiding.
---
Archives exist.
---
Good.  I recommend Mage or Hunter.  They‚Äôre cool, easy to learn and hard to master, and it‚Äôs fun to blow stuff up from a safe distance.
---
Bonus: hunters can have a cute pet =^_^=
---
USE YOUR TOUCH TO GRAB THE HOTTIE!
---
Each race has 2 spells based on their races. There is mild overlap sometimes but mostly unique. Only dwarves had fear ward so even if you were an average priest, but not a horrible one who would ruin the raid by being pure moron, you would be invited just for that one spell.
---
I suspect MC/Ony might take a little longer just because it'll take awhile for people to get up to 60 but I fully expect them to be cleared within 3 weeks.  As for the rest, they'll be cleared the day they open in each phase.
---
Long term I suspect MC/Ony/ZG/AQ20 and possibly chunks of BWL will be fully pugged routinely.
---
&gt; The vast majority of people here want as close to a recreation of Vanilla as Blizzard can do.
---
Ya, so let's not even let the other people discuss it on a public forum lol
---
If this thread is annoying to you why are you in it? just leave and let people discuss things they want to discuss.
---
Well part of that is just how MMOs are. The difference is there was some progression within tiers. Now you do the same raid just at a different difficulty as opposed to leaving one raid to go to another. 
---
Maybe this will help you understand:
---
Kara --&gt;gruuls---&gt;mag 
---
As opposed to 
---
Antorous (normal)--&gt; antorous(heroic)---&gt;antorous(mythic)
---
It's not very immersive to say "wow we completed that raid! Now time for a new challenge: the same raid! But slightly harder" 
---
As opposed to "wow we completed that raid. Time for a new challenge: a new raid!"
---
&gt;If people didnt want to play a 19 hour bg
---
Who the fuck has time for that?
---
If only I would have been injured by a city truck so I could collect disability but alas I am a vanilla player in my 30's and will have 2-3 hours of gameplay a day. 5 hours if I avoid my responsibilities completely outside my career.
---
It's going to take me forever. Which is fine.
---
This is false. Everyone in the city gets the buff. The difference between Pservers and Vanilla is there is an 8 hour cooldown on turning in a head.
---
It‚Äôs also a terrible idea. 
---
Buying used 5 year old hardware, with no support or upgrade path, from sketchy sellers on eBay that you have no way of validating the condition.
---
Sounds like a great recommendation.
---
i think i took it to show my friend fileplanet was in fact working, despite the horrid queue.
---
Right. AV was still there, essentially, but the spirit of the huge battle turned into a base rush.
---
I honestly cant focus on any game right now. I wish I had beta lol but i have been watching a lot of twitch in the meantime.
---
Imagine being a horde streamer who stream snipes allies, but still gets butthurt about this kind of stuff.  Blizzard giveth, blizzard taketh.  People avoided premades on retail, they did it on pservers, theyll do it here. They arnt going premade for the competition, on either faction.
---
I hate how literally nothing is difficult in the game anymore. Questing takes literally no brain. I dont have to plan pulls or be careful what I aggro. Dungeons are the same. There is no challenge left except in the highest tiers of PVE content. PvP is just a chaotic joke.
---
I think it's pretty safe to assume that the stress tests will continue to have more and more players than earlier ones.  Seems especially likely if they continue to raise the level cap, since players will be more spread out.
---
If they're tweaking infrastructure between tests, they'll need to increase the load on said infrastructure to see if improvements have been made.
---
Hope on, brother.
---
I really enjoy some of the classic content creators and youtubers, but I just cant understand why asmongold is so big and liked. He seems so obnoxious to me.
---
Maybe try doing something else other than gaming until Classic comes out?
---
Have they confirmed Ony buff in p1? Ony was in the game at 1.1 but she didn‚Äôt drop her head, and therefore the buff, until 1.3 when diremaul came out. There shouldn‚Äôt be any world buffs in P1 except songflower.
---
I'd like rated arena that doesn't have any gear or special currency tied to it like it did on retail. Make it gives a chunk of honor every week or something based on the rating you have but that's it.
---
I used to collect twink gear. 
---
If someone was starting a new twink they would always check with me for gear. 
---
I hope to collect all the twink gear again.
---
My ah my b I misunderstood
---
Yes. 
---
Retail server for each expansion would be nice. 
---
I would like to see classic, static, frozen servers. 
---
But also servers with new content, within the oldschool game. None of this new shit.
---
Regarding point 4. I should have clarified. Look for an elderly relative who spends most of their own time living in the filth of their own existence.

Whats the opener you used then? Those are nutty crits. I do agree though rogues should be able to shit all over a mage if they get the jump on them.
---
Looks like he assumed correctly lol
---
I recently got an air fryer and I can only assume it is very similar. You can buy frozen premade chicken wings and throw them in from frozen for 8 minutes and they come out super crispy. Anything frozen cooks in only a few minutes and turns out pretty amazing. I do frozen burgers, fries, wings, sausage links, taquitos, grilled cheese, or anything that you want fried. It is also healthier because it uses no oil and isn't a mess to clean up.
---
Don't forget (and correct me if I am wrong it's been well over a decade) you needed the proper rep as well.
---
Speculation is they don't want to siphon hype away from the next Retail patch, which is in July I think?
---
No. I am excited about Hytale too.
---
Well it's not out yet.
---
My personal favorite is Zuggernut. Alliance tremble in fear for THE ZUGGERNUT IS HERE

Org &gt; Ratchet &gt; Southern Barrens &gt; Tarren Mill &gt; Southern Barrens &gt; Ashenvale &gt; Southern Barrens &gt; Ratchet &gt; Silverpine Forrest &gt; Ratchet.

It's actually just south of Ratchet, but meh.
---
"Repair runs" tended to be raid enders. All of a sudden everyone needs to go take a shit, smoke or go get something to eat. Everyone swore they only needed 5 minutes to do those things, but you'd often be waiting 30 mins to an hour before everyone made it back to the raid. A repair bot keeps everyone focused and in the game.
---
Idk why this is the most common argument. Idk about u guys, but I'm not looking for a 5k, one server population. It's completely irrelevant.
---
This is what always got me with ESO. I‚Äôve tried that game countless times, even bought it on release. The combat just feels so awkward and clunky to me
---
I miss proper weapon glows
---
No, they won't.
---
Same as most people are not even doing Heroic raids on Retail, but fumble around in LFR and Normal-Mode, most people will level for a looooong time, then gear up slowly in endagame dungeons, and then run around in MC/ZG/AQ20 gear, with maybe a piece or two from BWL if they get a lucky PuG.
---
And that's completely okay.
---
Also the worgen in duskwood. Took a group of us about 40 minutes to kill 8 vilefang. In this time the named mob and the surrounding chests respawned 3 times. They all spawned at once after.
---
Genuinely curious, why do people hate this guy? I come to classic from private servers and must have missed out, im behind the times, im still hating on shenna
---
They are the best while leveling at everything. Best at PVP by far, best at questing, grinding mobs, DPS in dungeons, etc. 
---
At 60 they start to fall off, and since hunter is a popular class and not many are taken in raids, its hard to get a spot in a raiding group. Not to mention that pre-raid BIS is heavily competed with rogue and warriors.   
---
Still gonna roll a hunter for the amount of fun they are to play though, even if its gonna be harder for me to get a spot in raids.
---
Except warrior is also pretty much two button spam. Once you get some gear you don‚Äôt even bother leaving berserker stance. Maybe once in awhile you‚Äôll hit heroic strike. 
---
Then again having cooldowns to press is nice so there‚Äôs that.
---
I agree with you. I want classic. 
---
I am thinking of minor updates within the scope of classic. 
---
Like 1.11 to 1.12, content only, like a new dungeon. 
---
The thought is... 
---
In a year, all major guilds will max out on raiding, and get bored 
---
Stay within the 1.12 balance, but new raids, dungeons... eventually.
---
But you need to blast through so much content to do that. What I was saying is that doing that is the same as buying a boost in a game. Then complaining there is nothing to do. So many games these days are all about the end game first. Leveling is just the barrier to "the game". That attitude will give you a very lesser Classic experience imo. Versus someone who plays it like an RPG and realizes that the game IS the leveling.
---
Speaking of, wtf happened to reforged. Announced at Blizzcon then _silence_ ever since. Could they honestly be dumb enough to _not release it_ before WoW classic comes out?
---
He probably means having to train up weapon skill for each type of weapon. I get why it was done that way but it ends up just being a tedious chore for most people who have already done it multiple times.
---
Magmadar needs tranq shot to stop his enrage which luciferon drops 1 skillbook a clear and you need at least 3-4 to be successful. So probably a month or so until they can get past that part.
---
Oh wow... Bleach is older than I thought. Never watched it but the main Rogue I played Vanilla with always had to stop playing to watch his soap opera (Bleach).
---
They also said they will re-evaluate needs. So yes you probably won‚Äôt get in now or soon. I don‚Äôt see them not inviting more people or increasing the pool in time though. Seems weird to only have a closed beta with a small pool. As they already said their closed beta is uncharacteristically small.
---
Nay, I love seeing a characters portrait and know who they are before I even look at their name, if they have their hide helmet on.
---
I don't see why talking walruses, pigs, bugs, wolves, bears, hyena, and cows fit Warcraft, but pandas can't.
---
Low level alchemy pots are surprisingly strong and useful, and in classic there was no battle/guardian elixir restriction. I always love being an alchy and using all those super cheap elixirs while I leveled.
---
The old, "Kite him to Vael's room," strat.
---
Maybe they were trying to convey that you play the class and not the spec. Which is almost but not entirely true. You will always have your core toolkit with whatever build you want but the talents change your character at a functional level even if your core playstyle doesn't change drastically. Which is why you see warriors go Arms for pvp and Fury for raiding.
---
I imagine they will soon up TBC servers that you can transfer characters to.
---
Crying hell and damnation because the world is maybe just the tiniest bit better when men aren‚Äôt being encouraged to grab women (but only the hotties) is unwarranted and overreacting.
---
Don't know to be honest.
---
I don't hate him, but I don't watch streamers in any case, only a few Preach Vids every now and then, as hes my generation of players.
---
Really just used his name as an example :D
---
Well, it's a good thing I've had plenty of practice strafe running in project 1999.
---
Yes :( if I send Hasan nudes can I get a beta key?
---
Just don't start a paradox grand strat.  It'll ruin other strategy games for you entirely.
---
What do you mean by developping? Because clearly, you have no idea what it implies. Creating new content and developping are 2 different things. The challenges of recreating vanilla as it was 15 years ago on a different engine was an immense task, and the devs are being praised because they did an amazing job.
---
Cucked by the Alliance for 19 hrs straight HOLY

fair enough I guess

Are shadow hunters supposed to be shaman?
---
you don't need 3-4. lol. 3-4 makes mag a joke, but you can do it with less

If I understand the explanation for layering correctly, this should never happen once the system is working correctly.

I‚Äôm from Earthen Ring. We‚Äôre simple people. We get along. In all my years of playing since Vanilla, this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen our server mentioned on any platform of social media

I was already bored with every other game, and the modern trend of game design in general.

I can't get over how bad the leveling 60-70 is in that game. I never hit 70 in SB

Good lord the runbacks in this zone SUCK though
---
Thank you for helping me fill my time as i wait for this to finally release. I guess i have been subconsciously preparing and am getting new glasses with blue light technology. I will start to prepare a to do list and start knocking it out, so that i can have a less stressful time enjoying classic for the first time.
---
That MSN messenger shortcut got me more nostalgic than Classic ever can.

Where are the hot pockets and doritos bags
---
Wiping in naxx on the server that shall not be named atm so i atleast have something to do, even if it feels kiiinda pointless with classic coming out so soon. Feels exactly like wiping in naxx during vanilla with TBC on the horizon:P

Thats being safe cause it can still miss. Edit: the only way i really seeing it happen would be for 3(safety for missing tranq shot) seperate raids to run to get three hunters to get the skill then come back to mag and take him down. But you'd need 40 people with 3 different toons at 60 and geared- 120 seperate people geared to fight luci
---
Why aren't you posting them then?
---
Dungeon finder was one of the biggest contributing factors in retail WoW's loss of community. It's the very antithesis of what Classic is about.
---
Honestly people will be charging upwards of 50 gold for it. People know it's valuable and will try to nickel and dime you. 
---
And the ones that sell it for cheap will get bought by scalpers just reselling it for more.
---
After reading it I'm like 90% sure it's a parody article. 
---
"Obviously there are a few bad things as well such as no taunt and no shieldwall." said as basically an afterthought. 
---
Then goes on to list 11 consumables that he says are the "EXTREME MINIMUM" amount.
---
Microwaves are inefficient we drink Soylent now
---
I hope there‚Äôs people who try to play enhancement. 
---
But it‚Äôs one of those specs that did not translate well from 2005 to today where fewer people lag out, backpeddle, etc. Every ranged knows how to kite, etc. 
---
Most of the time in pvp, an enh shaman just feels like an ele sham who unlearned their talents but forgot to choose new ones. As you practice and get better, you learn to keep a shield on and kite melee.
---
I‚Äôve actually started playing on a classic FFXI server. It‚Äôs crazy to see inspiration from EQ and roots of early wow.
---
Sharding never had anything to do with "seeing people not on your realm." 
---
Sharding is literally layering but applied to a zone instead of a continent.
---
I think because the "Shadow Hunters" were very specific to the Trolls. Orcs and Taurens don't have Snakes in their iconography and overall style near as much as the Trolls, so they went for something a bit more...neutral.
---
More than 3 slots in my Stables for my Hunter companions.
---
Dead Zone?
---
Arrows cost?
---
One less bag than anyone else?
---
Screw that, the real struggle is choosing to drop Deathmaw, Broken Tooth, your Carrion Bird / Owl tank, or your Son of Hakkar whenever you need to go learn a new skill.
---
You nailed it. 
---
I am thinking classic 1.12,  but add basic content. Raids, dungeons. 
---
Imagine if a expansion came out, added 3 new raids, but no level increase. 
---
I'm just rambling, but I would love to see vanilla lore expanded, such as the orginal warcraft books, before TBC. 
---
New content, within the scope of vanilla.
---
To be fair I have seen just as weird if not weirder shit on pvp servers.  I'd also rather see some elven sex cult then some 13 year edgelord saying n\*\*\*er in chat every 5 seconds.
---
where is the mission table in vanilla wow?
---
Then you just waste your own, yeah? Seems pretty childish
---
Besides healing potions, Scrolls of [insert stat here] are useful as well!
---
When I was on my warrior in Elwynn, I'd play through that zone slowly.  Level mining to 75, level blacksmithing to wherever gives level 15 equipment. Level Fishing, Cooking, and First Aid.
---
Every little upgrade, you actually notice the difference. 2 extra strength you can see that! 5 extra damage, super noticeable!
---
I have not noticed this at all &amp; was playing a baby gnome this afternoon
---
they need to add challenge back to retail. Nothing is hard anymore. Reputation grinds are not hard
---
What. Do you not know that it's also cross realm... Whereas layering doesn't have any cross realm whatsoever??
---
Edit: so, in short, it's not literally the same. As you claim it is. Also, they asked ME what the worst part was for ME.
---
What an odd but cool coincidence. So nice you still have that. I have about 4 screenshots from classic left, everything else evaporated through several windows reinstalls over the years with basically no backuping.
---
At least I got one with my old raid in BWL so I don't forget their names.
---
Do you want to PvP?
---
Are you attacted to insanely high skill capped characters that provide you with unlimited outplay potential? Pick Mage.
---
Are you edgy and bad at the game? Pick Warlock.
---
Joana's gone down to 94 hours tho.
---
Poopsock speedlevelers are going to get sub 100 hours.
---
Just like @wegwacc I don't watch streams, but I  dislike that dude because of his in-game toxicity and trolling, I wouldn't wanna be on his group, not even his realm
---
I'm not saying it's a bad thing at all. In fact I love it! I played all of those games as a kid and I'll play them again when they are released. I agree with you, I have noticed a turn in Disney within the last decade.
---
Balance is only a concern when there's gear that can only be obtained through arena rating. Make it just give a chunk of honor and/or contribute towards your rank and then arena balance isn't much of a concern anymore.
---
The beta doesn't seem like it has *that* many people to need layers.
---
I did day 10 on a pserver recently(with proper exp) and yeah it was rough. I played way more casually than everyone else, was 59 as a hunter on the day. I played 35h on the launch, then about 14-16 on the following days taking 1 entire day off for some family stuff. Think my /played at 60 which was day 11 was 6days played, so that's avg. 13hour aday. 
---
Hardest part is having enough people who actually no life level especially on the weaker classes like rogue/warr and the more "casual" classes like healers(yes healers are usually more casual from my exp), the guild I was in had recruited like 60 pserver heroes so we had enough, but I can't see a regular guild do it without mass recruiting. The mages are the ones who farm the rep btw and they level very fast, some hunter can join and get boosted on it as well so that you have 8.
---
Let's be real. Whatever class that just ganked me is a noob class.
---
regardless. Its nearly useless. It increases the range by such a small amount, and with how infrequently the server ticks the rogue will be on you before you can react anyhow.
---
I played a healer in PvP
---
Agree tbc killed wow for me
---
The culture and lore doesn't fit or mesh with warcraft universe. It was forced.
---
Ah makes sense I guess. But you need 40+ people to do that.
---
I have the addon on private servers, have to press twice. once to dismount and once to cast the spell.
---
Yeah, but well, do you know the percentage of players who killed mythic jaina? around a thousand. Imagining there are still 2 millions people playing the game, well you are top 1%. Sounds stupid said like that but it's true.
---
True, I started watching him right around his start which was a few months after tbc launched, been a long time since I‚Äôve seen those SM clears
---
I guarantee there will be addons to sort your bags and search them. I'm pretty sure ElvUI already has a version for the beta and includes those.
---
Druid not Shaman
---
**&lt;rockstar&gt;**
---
\[Alliance\]\[NA\]\[PvP\]
---
Semi-Hard, Evenings/Weekends, times TBD
---
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
**Summary:**
---
The premium non-hardcore WoW experience. This guild is targeted towards stable adults and is designed to fit well with a standard working-person's routine. We want members whose schedule fits so they will want to stay with a balanced community long term. The leadership will strive to be transparent, fair, and do what they can to make our plans and goals a reality.
---
**The Four Tenants:**
---
1. Enjoy What you do and Who you do it with: Having fun is more important than enduring the pressure of raiding most nights. We will focus on building a strong, drama-free community of gamers.
---
2. Excellence at what you do: Strive to be among the best for the limited time we have
---
3. Make the most of y(our) time: We will find creative ways to be efficient, and members will respect the groups' time by being prepared to the extent that is possible. Planning and organizing will carry this very far as long as people meet expectations.
---
4. Balance: We will go at our own pace, not raid -too- much, and respect everyone's need to be a responsible adult outside of the game!
---
**Raid Details:** 
---
Everyone will want to experience as much of raiding content as possible. I would like to give everyone the opportunity to experience what is possible to clear in this type of guild.
---
Schedule: Main 40 man scheduled raids will have a 3-4 night per week schedule, based on a survey of the guild's availability a few weeks before the first raid.
---
Progress: The key here is to go at our own pace and not compare ourselves to hardcore guilds. As long as progress is made and people work on their characters when they can, we will clear content and possibly all of it, eventually. Content release schedule will be longer-tailed, and raids do not become irrelevant like in other WoW expansions. Progress and Blizzard content plan permitting, officers will create plans to maximize possibility of clearing all content.
---
Classes: When it is clear that class choice or performance is becoming a liability, then that will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. I'm fine with sub-par classes players for easier raids. There will be opportunities to include those who aren't part of progress content.
---
Loot council: DKP systems are fair, but are easy to abuse without additional rules. A council system will generally give drops to characters that would benefit the long-term position of the guild in scheduled raids. A calibrated executive decision is a straightforward way to go.
---
Alts: Everyone will be encouraged (not mandatory) to work on an alt character. The personal benefits are farming, tradeskills, diversity, summoning, scouting, PvP etc. This character will enable alt raids and potential raid splits if MC/BWL are clearable early/easily.
---
**PvP:** 
---
Grouped PvP will be a part of the guild's experience, going on a regular basis on off-raid-nights.
---
**Other Activities:** 
---
Allows members to still have fun with the group but not be required to be online every night. Alt/farm raids if people want to shoot-off an MC clear on an off-tuesday night, this could very well be a reality. 20-mans on off-nights to have fun and to gear up new characters. Be social in the active discord w/ potential to play other games together, post media, chat on your phone at work, etc.
---
**About the Guild Master:** 
---
Veteran of Rank-1 NA guilds between WotLK and WoD, now mid-30's married professional. I want to enjoy WoW again and run a guild that others can enjoy and benefit in a way that others have given me. I have learned effective (and seen poor) leadership styles from elite raiding guilds and my career, and how to convert a vision into tangible plans.
---
**Discord:**
---
[https://discord.gg/ep83vAJ](https://discord.gg/ep83vAJ)
---
Find an online admin/officer/member and to start a conversation about your interest in the community. We are looking for various levels of involvement: officers, raiders, PvP-er's, and casual players.
---
Shammys will be one of the most popular classes, according to all the polls and private servers.
---
Omar is on the team. So that‚Äôs at least one I know of for sure.
---
none of the sweaty guilds care about being safe. if it misses then its a wipe and they reclear and retry. they'll go until it dies.
---
ANd the healing from the Renew, you will inevitably earn.
---
My standard answer whenever this kind of discussion comes up: **Let's see what happens.**
---
Classic is still not released. With all we see so far, I think it's set for tremendous success, but only time will tell.
---
And if it does end up a big success, well...we'll see what happens.
---
people would invite me to random raids on my lock in vanilla. I think its cause I would volunteer to do coe or cos and would always have a big bag of shards and start handing out green rocks as we did trash mobs. That said during many trash mobs i would instead of fighting make more stones and only drain souls at the end. I was invited by random guilds/people to everything except naxx like that despite not being in or being in other non raiding guilds. Even got gear at times because I deserved it they would say.
---
If you pee as an undead you have bigger problems.
---
It‚Äôs gotten me three days straight
---
he's annoying
---
sounds like vanilla to me
---
Open world pvp wow is some of the most fun I've had in a game. Unfortunately there are some assholes that spend all of their time ganking lowbies because they have shitty personalities. However if you want to start battles outside of a town the best way to poke the hornet's nest is by killing two or three lowbies, and then loitering outside of town. Eventually you'll be outnumbered and have a good time testing out your pvp skills.
---
Omar Gonzalez ‚ô•.
---
I hope he keeps all the new people in check and reminds them of why people like Classic.
---
That 1 extra damage early on adds up
---
Class design. The decided for the sake of balance and fantasy to make the shaman use totems based on the elements. Decided an offensive turret totem would fit best under the fire catagory. Decided having it be named Serpent Ward did not fit the fantasy of fire totems.
---
Couldn't you use another addon that puts the UI into more modern, simpler colors to circumvent it?
---
Shift out -&gt; Auto -&gt; spell, takes around 0,1 seconds.
---
What a way to worm in some extra dps!
---
Yep. We‚Äôre stockpiling and sharing. Thank god the USPS can‚Äôt afford drug dogs.
---
I think AV is such an interesting thing. People are so mad that we have the 1.12 version now. But you guys don‚Äôt seem to remember that it was not just the loud, vocal minority that begged for changes to AV. 
---
People were actually pretty fucking pissed off after the first month or so that AV would last an entire weekend. 
---
Now everyone is crying that it‚Äôs not that way which is interesting to see. 
---
I liked the old AV but having remembered it pretty clearly - I can definitely see why it was changed. That shit was absolute hell if you were melee in its original form and I distinctly remember a lot of people felt pretty meh about AV due to the sheer lack of progress you‚Äôd get vs time invested even in vanilla.
---
I wish I had gold to give you, but since I don't I offer you an internet hi-five.
---
No cuz like, afk, so I go spend my time doing something else. Making pvp unplayable for others is just as childish as afking so why not meet at their level?
---
As someone who is currently suffering through upgrading to Windows 10 at work, I long for that XP start menu more than anything else mentioned in this post.
---
I bet he was trying just as hard not to die before level 20 as he was in his Blizzcon Arena tournaments!
---
I also definitely didn't watch him dieing on his vanilla character while tabbed out practicing arena on live either.
---
What's the point in hyperbole like this, other than to circlejerk?
---
I'm sure there are a few that will get close to that but saying World record was 4d20h "when there was 4 people in the world trying to level quickly and didn't know what they're doing." is disingenuous at best. Joana knew very well what he was doing and had to practice to get it to that point. Even if they think they have 40 people who are ready to dedicate to that, I can't see it happening. We'll see soon though =D
---
All BGs in at launch with all the different level ranges.  No rep could be gained with the faction until the appropriate patch release.  I just want instanced pvp to do some fast games instead of going to tm ss to see if there is anything going on.  Then going to STV.  Then logging out because no one is active in those zones.
---
This is some tryhard gatekeeping.
---
There's plenty of people having fun with BFA. Even when people bitch about the game it's still got plenty of rewarding content. The problem with it is that Vanilla had an under served market that's now being served with 'new' content, and BFA is in between raid tiers.
---
There's nothing new to see in BFA at the moment versus a metagame environment that's never been tested enmasse before. It's a fun gimmick.
---
Agreed. Still the same server. Same people. Still build a reputation for yourself. It‚Äôs a win win across the board. 
---
The removal of traveling to dungeons etc was what killed the worldly feel imo.
---
Yup. Healthones and Soulstones can make a progression attempt and Summons are amazing. It sucks being the lock who has to run ahead, but at least people will get to know you more. I remember when I first started raiding on my warlock, which didn't last long lol, and I got chewed out for not have 4 full bags of Shards.
---
Because he's a leader. His stream is okay most of the time. The reason you have such a negative opinion of him is that. The youtube videos he's in aren't made by him. They are made by 3rd party aggregators who take a 16 hour stream of him being engaging and pretty cool. Then they chop out the 20 minutes he was whining. To be honest I don't think his stream would have any whining except his friend Mckuck is unbearable. Though I will never understand hows he's bigger then Esfand. Who is ten times better.
---
It hasn't changed raiding at all if you mean LFR.
---
People use the custom group section to pug norm/heroic/easy mythic bosses later on. But that's just the same as they did in WoTLK via trade chat etc.
---
Raiding is still guild based as always.
---
Hunters are [phenomenal in PVP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B24r8J6ZZs) but you're going to have to put in a lot of effort to juggle your dead zone, your pet, trinkets, consumables, offhand items and lots of clever macros to drop you in and out of combat.
---
It's a really easy class to pick up but I'd argue it has one of the highest skill caps in the game.
---
I don't see how the culture and lore didn't fit or mesh with the warcraft universe. They fit in way better than the Dranei or Gnomes.
---
Regardless, How does Pandas fit LESS than Cows?
---
It was a funny point, that Cdew himself said on stream.
---
Thanks so much for this. I've been looking for a fun side coding project. Classic mods seem like a good choice. My problem with wow modding has always been sufficient resources and docs. Any and all helps.
---
Or maybe we don't need amphetamines to play wow :D
---
I guess this is how our parents must have felt about Pikachu and Spongebob.
---
Not saying it will be you, but there will be shitloads of people begging for all the things that this community currently is downvoting and attacking within a year for sure. There will be front page suggestions for new QoL features. It literally happens for every game I‚Äôve ever played and browsed the games reddit.
---
Osrs, PoE, Tera, BDO.... every game‚Äôs reddit will inevitably be filled with people sitting on reddit at work, trying their hardest to make it easier to keep up. Not saying blizz should listen but if you think the subreddit won‚Äôt be flooded with these posts I got bad news for ya
---
I said some aspects of current not classic as a way of pointing out current wow was closer to a mobile game compared to classic
---
&gt;since they have enough stress testers.
---
bruh
---
What about all those fishing bugs you could be reporting! :s I usually can't stand fishing either tbh. It has good rewards but I kinda wish it just wasn't a thing at all, so I wouldn't have to do it or feel bad about missing the rewards.
---
It's the MethodJosh model.
---
MC and Ony will definitely be down within the 2nd lockout. First is possible since I assume you're gonna get a guild of pserver guys that plan to no life to go for world first.
---
Out of interest, what is your current live progress? Or most recent live progress world ranking wise? 
---
Just interested in a point of reference re. how hard C'Thun/4H seem now.
---
I raided pretty hardcore in TBC/Wrath, and I defiinitely feel this way. I remember at least one occasion where something my class had that was good utility in raiding got nerfed exclusively for PVP reasons. I've always felt that the game should be balanced from a raiding perspective, top-down, and PVP be a thing you can do for fun on the side. Trying to turn WoW PVP into an esport never sat well with me.
---
Like the other commenters, I don't hate him at all. I just find his personality very obnoxious and arrogant (Which is part of his twitch persona and appeal I suppose, to each their own). But there's nothing forcing me to watch his Twitch channel so he's easy enough to ignore there.
---
However I'm pretty sick of seeing the dozen or so channels on Youtube that do nothing but post clip/reactions from his stream, showing up on every wow search and in the recommended videos.
---
So filtering him out is a quick fix.
---
So like twitch except no viewers/donations
---
You did need to sub to get beta access.  If you don‚Äôt already have it there is very very very little chance (if any) that you get in at this point. 
---
Be happy tho, you get to go into the actual launch  completely fresh.  I‚Äôve actually had beta access since a few days in and haven‚Äôt logged in once (nor do I plan on it).  Would rather be completely fresh and ready to roll with characters I actually get to keep.
---
Not sure actually, couldn't have been longer than a few days
---
Pretty sure witch doctors were rolled into shamans as the whole "ward" thing was clearly the inspiration for the totems in WoW.
---
Yup. Rofl. Was fun though.
---
It definitely wasnt because of arena. It was mostly a PvE change so you didnt need to carry the moron that rolled a Draenei Spriest just to get the +hit buff and shit like that.
---
Arena definitely became the focus of PvP balance tho but thats what everyone who was PvPing was playing.
---
I'll be right there with you. 60 will come eventually and you can fully clear the game on a 2 night a week raid schedule.
---
Also never start a land war in Asia.
---
Most Classic raids will be easier than normal mode retail.
---
I was playing classic WoW for the first time with my long-time-player friends. I was on the role of tank, because I liked tanking on Blizz's WoW. I didn't know that Tab was the button to tap to switch targets. When my friends found out about that, while we were on the first section of Deadmines, everyone went ballistic. I got bullied into learning to spam Tab, and still the whole dungeon must've taken us around 5 hours to complete. To this day, it's one of the most cherished memories I have of playing online with friends.
---
Rated bgs, vanilla wow lacks an endgame to pvp outside of gm/hw farm
---
Are you speaking from Vanilla or Pserver? 2h Fury was the main DPS spec I've seen on both...   
---
Deathwish + Execute can take you from middle of the pack to miles ahead #1 damage and likely going to die at 5% from pulling aggro.
---
Just a lame joke üôÇ
---
I actually had fun this weekend watching streams of the beta. Which was weird, but it was very nostalgic and fun. One thing I realized is that the unpopular classes in pvp did pretty well with skilled players, at least at 30. A confirmation that I definitely needed to l2p back then.
---
And Ret Paladins will be there too.
---
Yes, he said it flippantly and facetiously in passing.
---
I also watched him corpserun and brute force the same elite spider like 4-5 times just because he wanted to see if he could do it, and didn't want to try kiting or swapping to 1h + shield.
---
People are playing to have fun and show the game off on stream, they aren't sweaty try harding and getting beaten down by how hard it is.
---
probably a friend of his could have gained access and lures his friends into a life sucking experience untill august arrives
---
I agree, 7 series is minimum. but itll work.
---
&gt; ...so I could collect disability...
---
[Never give up hope, my friend!](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bu46eg/august_27_2019/ep6pr20/?context=3)
---
People should honestly stop being so good at the game. Then nobody will AFK out
---
Are you daft? Obviously you need to kill mobs to get SS I‚Äôm saying that most people are turned away from the fact that you need to fill your bags with 40ss before a raid and that‚Äôs simply not the case. The only thing you need a ss for solo content is to summon pet. If you are farming you dot the mob wand and let voidwalker tank and you take 0 damage so no eating . Have you ever played a warlock or are you just putting your 2cents in with 0 knowledge of what you are saying?
---
Oh thats super good to know. I havent been good about all the media information about classic. Thank you very much
---
And I could see your point, maybe if WoW had a more robust tutorial like system. Like it introduces you piece-meal to certain aspects and presses on you that this will be important as you leave the 1-5 experience. Without that though, and instead just a few pop-ups I think the starting experience enemies need to resemble their higher level versions. Otherwise new players might feel misled. I may just be speaking from some negative experiences though. Often when something is "overtuned" in Retail a lot of players used to easier and faster gameplay throw a fit. They revamped leveling a while ago, and while doing so made a lot of enemies in dungeons much longer kills. Not everyone was happy with that.
---
Yeah even most private servers can manage to script a proper 20% proc chance, no worries.
---
Ironic because we do.
---
You are mixing patches. I only played AV after Korrak left and the matches were still long and could last for a day or two.
---
No you‚Äôre not crazy. In fact up until the release date announcement [this was the top post of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a16wwq/unpopular_opinion_the_future_of_wow_classic/).
---
I think as long as they keep servers around with no changes i‚Äôm 100% for new content.
---
Just in BGs tho. World PvP will still have its clowns
---
Warrior damage and Paladin tanks?! Dafuq.
---
How in my 30 years on this planet I never found out that mbps and mbit mean exactly the same thing will probably remain a mystery. Why in the fuck tho. And also why would a download manager show your connection speed rather than your download speed. Wat.
---
Not a chance. They want people on their servers. The events they create are a big draw, and they need to be able to make snap raids at a moments notice
---
with 3/3 of the sub talent you got to 85% speed
---
So shaman in warcraft didn‚Äôt have totems? I always did feel they mixed a bunch of stuff to make them though. They have spirit based spells and nature spells and elemental totems and they also do hexes and stuff. The lore tries to make them sound like they‚Äôre one with the elements, but what element gives you the ability to turn someone into a frog?
---
No one will clear MC week 1.  ony may be possible but unlikely.
---
Aside from the Hydraxian rep, getting your tanks to 60 in less than 7 days is crazy.
---
The only time I had 4 bags full of just shards was when 4 friends and I sold mc attuments. Decent money and the people got way easy attunements.
---
Hunter, feral Druid. Both have 30% movement speed.
---
Beta invites are through except for Friends &amp; Family.
---
* Keep Updated Textures/Models (not in beta so not sure if this is currently the case?)
---
* XP from PVP
---
Idk what polls you're referring to, but the ones I've seen, Shaman was at the bottom.
---
MC is releasing on launch and everyone will be level 1. So i'm gonna go out on a limb and say it won't be cleared in 6 hours.
---
I‚Äôm going warrior tank, but I won‚Äôt tank for a guild unless they agree to pay my repair bill during raids. Take advantage of capitalism!
---
Okay I'll retest soon.
---
Ok?  Do you not understand what the numbers 1.x mean in what I replied to?  I summarized the changes to AV while adding a bit of info.
---
MC is early for it, but your guild would have eventually ran into a hard competence check (and gear) on Vael.
---
Just wait until classic comes out, the more hype u get :D
---
Bhag'Thera is level 40 elite, you aren't going to solo that at 28 or 29. Might as well have a full group and cut the xp down as much as you can as they are mostly (all?) kill count quests, no farming for the elusive heart that only 1 in 10 animals have or whatever.
---
so what do I need to do to get an adderall prescription?  No way its OTC right?
---
Faction imbalance is going to suck.
---
Yes, edited the post. For total, theyre ofc at the bottom as their number is basically divided by 2.
---
Links to polls? I was planning on playing shammy lol
---
You can. First explore wherever you might go later though
---
I need my nostalgia tho lol
---
If the polls are any indication, Shaman won't just be equal in popularity to Warriors, they'll be *more* popular, to the tune of about 25%.
---
FWIW I thought it was painfully obvious that Naxx &gt; WOTLK meant "Moving on with The Burning Crusade after people have exhausted Naxx content and gotten tired with Vanilla, and similarly moving onto Wrath of the Lich King after Sunwell Plateau is played out."
---
It was short hand. Moving straight from Naxxramas to Wrath of the Lich King makes zero sense, lol.
---
&gt;I'm pretty sick of seeing the dozen or so channels on Youtube that do nothing but post clip/reactions from his stream
---
I totally get that, i watched one video last night from another streamer, this morning my top 3 suggestions are the same highlight, from different people/channels, like damn.
---
In my experience, the 17/34/0 cookie cutter fury warrior with all of his gear lifted off of a spreadsheet puts more effort into downing bosses than the "RUN WHAT YA BRUNG" all-in-one spec shaman. I don't see how you can try to put a playstyle that is *actually* based on putting less effort into the game on a pedestal by insinuating that they put *more* effort into the game. That's just not how things work. If a person's talent specialization - the absolute easiest thing to fix - isn't committed to raiding, then chances are high that the player isn't either.

I'm not saying you *can't* play with a sub-par raiding spec - do what your heart tells you. What I *am* saying is that the sentiment in the thread title is misleading players who might be new to a pre-dual spec game. If you want to play a role without the proper tools, it won't be long until you're replaced by someone who does have the proper tools.
---
You need exalted rep to buy other faction mounts. But thought something was different in original version. Maybe mounts are BoE instead of BoP because I remember someone saying have someone or an alt of that faction buy the mount you want. Could of sworn after the change the mounts couldn't be traded?
---
In the best gear possible it's a mediocre spec. There will be seas of salt.
---
Grand Marshal going 137-199. 
---
Just Vanilla things.
---
Season 1 Gladiator.
---
Somewhat misleading. They've reached the amount they currently want and have tapered off for the foreseeable future but will issue more invites as they see fit. 
---
I.e. unlikely but not impossible. Wouldn't resub for it if you have no interest in current game.
---
&gt; Edit 2: blind hunter was the only pet that retained their cc immunity throughout vanilla, all other tameable bosses had it fixed before 2.0.
---
This is actually really intriguing.  Clearly a bug, but you think they'll let it stand for the sake of #NoChanges?  I would think that would make it the de-facto Hunter PvP pet.
---
Yup pretty much suums up my life right now. Wish they would throw more invites out. Though I dont know if they havent or not. I know more streamers got into the beta recently. I would have hoped they gave more out to plebs though. A  good portion of the streamers i watch arent even playing it anymore. Really disappointing tbh..

You lost the BG, but still feel like a winner classic WoW in a nutshell.
---
This sounds like aids.
---
Only reason they‚Äôre at the bottom is because only the people playing horde pick them. If 15% of people want to be warriors but 8% will be shamans/paladins, assuming a pretty even split of A:H, they become the most popular choice on that faction.

I have an Invite but my wife hasn't yet. We've played together since we met in Vanilla. We take turns on it right now, I've let her make a few chars and I have a few.  
---
Whilst one is playing we stream it on twitch so the other can just watch it downstairs in the xbox.  No mic or crappy music just gameplay. It's a really chilled way for us to share the experience as fairly as possible.  
---
Haven't thought about loading up a different game since beta. I tried watching streamers but find them quite annoying. I do watch some content on YouTube each morning before work however from the likes of preach or taliesen etc August cant come quick enough
---
Warlock / Pally, both get free mounts
---
Yeah he probably tilted when OP said hes a former glad and himself could never be one.
---
Until you are like level 30, you are still gonna be leveling fireball as a frost spec.
---
It's fine though, most raids want 6+ shamans.
---
Well you need 80ish gold by 40, I‚Äôve just never been able to afford it on any fresh server I‚Äôve ever played on without grinding a bit.
---
It really isn't about underestimation.
---
It is entirely about being able to afford your mount and skills.
---
Or that bear one....forget the name.

Ok
---
RBGs to replace R14
---
R14 grind is really the very worst feature classic had by a long shot. It didn't reward skill at all. Just massive inhuman amounts of time investment, botting and accountsharing. It heavily promoted a very unhealthy and ToS-breaking playstyle.
---
Saving raid IDs

I've been going through and fixing up things like TukUI, ElvUI, and Auctioneer. Never really worked with LUA before.

---
These two have gotten me through most of the issues.
---
Since the beta is just an 8.0 engine, you really just have to strip out or wrap methods that aren't available in the Vanilla API.
---
Yes, that means sharing loot with 6+ other shamans :D
---
A  couple of things. 
---
I've asked questions and not stated anything explicitly I don't think so i'm not invested in being right or wrong. I had kept open possibilities either way because I hadn't seen newer information.
---
The quote from Ion about having the client and server data, they had previously said they didn't have this data and I hadn't seen that he'd said this. I now can be confident they have the actual data. Thank you. 
---
I've never said you weren't right. Links to sources such as the interview with Ion are good sources from which I can update information, also the interview with Omar. This hadn't displayed when I tried to view it on my phone so apologies for missing that. As for a random person on Reddit? I can't just take your word for things and accept it just because you say "you're wrong", not one of us should do that. The sources validate what you've said though and in addition to this makes it more likely that when I see your posts I can have greater confidence they're likely to be accurate. It's the same way we build trust in any interaction.
---
I'm not above accepting I have been on some info here, I don't see being wrong as a fault unless there's no learning from corrected info. 
---
You've been very helpful and I am sorry if you've felt frustrated in these interactions. That was never my intention.
---
Get out
---
This has been reported at length. I can attest to doing it myself last week. Thise exact spots even.
---
The answer weve seen is this isnt a bug and were misremembering it. They have the code and know its right.
---
Not a chance. Ive never seen everything spawn within a second all over after 25 minutes of nothing.
---
Were almost certain this is a layering problem... but thats us not knowing anything about how layering works. But i mean probably.
---
Mounts are an aura. You can cancelaura your mount, which does not count as an action (at least didn't back then I'm quite sure) and then cast.
---
I think most people that "want Vanilla" want the game to be great like it was during Vanilla. They don't really want to eat Vanilla and nothing but for the rest of their lives. This will become more and more obvious as time goes on.
---
Is warrior/rogues considered weak classes? I thought they were top dogs in vanilla, feel like half this sub wants to roll either of the 2
---
I do, but I'm also saying AV was perfectly fine in 1.10. I played loads of Alterac Valley even before they introduced +1 rep for each honorable kill.
---
Your mount is an aura. Cancelling auras does not (or at least did not) block further actions I'm pretty sure.
---
Well yes and no. Tier is good of course but most sought after healing gear is well.. just healing gear. It doesn't really matter if it's 6 priests or 6 shamans that you are fighting over loot.
---
private servers don't have AV working properly
---
Bearshare

I‚Äôve followed him on streams as well, he doesnt seem that interesting there either. Alhough watching streamer play on for hours has never really been too interesting for me
---
It's actually running on a BfA client. Similar min specs, but I'd say if it runs BfA it'll run Classic is a better rule of thumb.
---
At end game they're great, yes. Leveling not so much.
---
Weak in terms of leveling speed.
---
Once they hit 60 they are top dogs for sure.

They're weak for leveling is what he meant. So harder/longer to get to 60.

I see a lot of people saying "theres going to be an addon for this"...well why wouldn't you let Blizz just put it in the game in the first place? Whats the difference between an addon changing the game or Blizz doing a small QoL (within reason). Is it really #nochanges if theres going to be a bunch of addons changing the game anyway?
---
IIRC you can not hit exalted with just quests, you'll have to do cloth turn ns.
---
But they choose not to rebuild it at least in specific areas where people liked to do it.
---
This is very true. When I first dinged 51, I spent days trying to get an AV win so I could get my Ice-Barbed Spear. That was my main focus. Some of the queue times and situations in that BG were really frustrating.
---
I finally got it, and then I was able to have some fun in AV, but it could be a mess.
---
Spear was totally worth it though. That thing was a beast.
---
Mhmm, it doesnt really help that you‚Äôll lose tier AND the most sought after items
---
No, it's called "presenting a fact".
---
Whether or not you agree with it, is irrelevant.
---
Reputation gained from quests decreases as your outlevel quests. Your best bet is to level entirely in Undead zones and then grind runecloth for the remainder.
---
1. Noob hunters constantly pulled agro in dungeons because the pet was set to defensive vs passive
---
      a. Hunter pets growl set to auto cast, constantly pulling threat off the tank
---
      b. Hunters could roll on damned near anything, and noob hunters thought that meant that anything they COULD roll on they SHOULD roll on.
---
2. They're good enough in pvp vs the right enemies.

3. No problem, much love

You dont need a full raid of 60s to kill reg. 58s is enough for the most parts

Mhm nah I watch his stream from time to time he's clearly obnoxious. This "leader" role rests on nothing but his streamer position, the guy is basically an NPC, being guided by actual gamers for any trick or glitch he plans to explore for a recent example...
---
I'll upvote ya. I feel the same way. I played during vanilla, loved it, and i play now, still love it. I will play both. Because i love both. Not sure why you have to hate on one to love the other.
---
Yuuuuup. This happened to me on 2 characters so far. Certain spots are super bad for it, and sadly there is a higher kill requirement for the quest than actual spawns of them.
---
I know in vanilla ive never seen that place farmed out, and they were super dangerous. Now its an hour long quest with a 5 man jumping around bored.
---
Soda is definitely my favorite streamer. I make sure to give him money out of my paycheck every month. Totally worth it to hear my name called by my favorite streamer =) I think if I donate enough to him we might become best pals

The hydraxian rep is a non issue with mages aoe farming it. You just need 7 or 8 people to get to honored for a Rag clear. Multiple people have gotten warriors to 60 in less than 7 days. It will be hard, but there will absolutely be a guild of dedicated pserver vets that plan to try for the Rag kill in the first lockout phase. I don't know that they'll get there, but they'll certainly get close.
---
Glad i'm rolling horde so I won't have to deal with the ret palas not healing in bgs.

id prob
---
warlock/priest (or mage)
---
both dot builds , run dot mobs run to next pack repeat
---
at lower level voidwalker and just wand
---
war/mage (or priest)
---
war tanks , mage kills and sheeps
---
druid/rogue 
---
rogue kills druid tanks and or heals
---
paladin/hunter
---
 hunter would prob be on follow and use the pet and a basic rotation , paladin would be either ret or prot
---
ill prob do similar but with 3-5 i like 3 combo's a lot better than 2
---
edit actually hunter pally may not work due to hunter dead zone , in that case you would need to match it with another ranged
---
Can you get into RFC before lv13?
---
 If the spell is orange, you can chose whether to train it or not.
---
It's not that he's interesting it's that he's a leader. His target audience is 7-16. He leads them places and organizes them to do things. Thats why he's so popular. People, especially young people gravitate to leader ship. People are hard wired to do that. He's very good at what he does. Chances are though. You don't fall in his target audience range. Basically I am saying you don't get blues clues because your not a kid. Same with Asmogold. You are not his target audience.
---
doritos on the floor and hot pockets are in the microwave
---
Well if you divide other classes(not paladin) by 2, you‚Äôll see that shaman is the biggest of them all. (Because shaman is horde only, so basically 50% less. To get the real percentage for horde, you double the amount of shamans to compare to total.)
---
If you can stand fishing, that's not a bad way to go either.
---
Personally, I'd rather jerk off with 40 grit sandpaper than fish.
---
Apology accepted.
---
Well traditionally (this was changed on ND latest server, but been the case for every other), the meta has been that you only queue AV doing AV weekend, and doing that you zerg full offense no defense and whoever is fastest wins, as that gives the most rep and honor. But off AV weekend the games are filled with less meta oritated players, and especially a lot of lowbies, and because the games don't actually fill it's more like 15-25 on each team, the games usually take forever. And of course on AV weekends there are some people who just want to watch the world burn, and form up a small premade of defenders to turtle out games to annoy either the opposite or own faction, it doesn't take more than 2-4 mages and a healer to completely destroy a zerg, and a typical reaction to ones own zerg failing is for some to teleport back and ruin the other factions zerg. And that's how you get turtles :D
---
As for how the zerg strats works, you run all the way to the enemy base and take the graveyard, you ignore the towers completley. Usually you have a big prot tank riding n front tahking the mobs(with defense capped you can't get dazed btw). Then you slowly kill the warmaster/marshall which are some NPC's defending final boss despawned  by taking towers, you can seperate pull them out and when all of them are dead you kill the warchief, this takes about 10 mins total. Alternatively when you have a sick premade going you straight up tank all the marshal/warchiefs while zerging the boss and not even taking graveyard. This means 6-8min games.
---
It's the same concept as the basic hunter vanilla rotation except with some melee attack cooldown to play around in relation to ranged attack speed
---
This is then basically repeated ad infinitum.
---
That's still nothing compared to the rage management and stance dancing and second by second decision making a proper 2h fury slam warrior has to do
---
It seems to me, that the only acceptable answer for you would be: 
---
50G seems like a reasonable number.
---
And that's just the way it is.
---
You get more rep doing the quests at the correct character level. So doing the quests at 60 wont be enough. You'll have to grind turn-ins for repeatable quests or mob grind or something.
---
Just speaking from something I read on night elf rep for other races to get their mounts. So ideally you want to run early to the zone that has the rep you want. And you want to know what zones give that rep to assure you hit them all. If you do, you'll likely have or be close to the needed rep I think.
---
I was just thinking about this at work today (haven't seen this post until now) and I had pretty similar thoughts.
---
I have an average of about 5 hours of free time a day. Times 90 days that's 450 hours of free time. Think of what one can accomplish with that amount of time if it is not wasted. 
---
Reminds me of Seneca:
---
&gt;It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.
---
I've got a nice fat list of tasks I can check off and of more general goals like working out before work, eating better, etc. 
---
Let's do this!
---
Too late I already rolled need on all the priest gear...for my mend pet.
---
I‚Äôm sure you and your friend do. 
---
But you saying that is pretty funny seeing as OP admits he meant naxx to TBC and then to Wrath. Not fresh new content.
---
Only addon I really want is Classicons
---
Dueling is so obnoxious and toxic as a hunter. 9/10 of the time the opponent tries to start the duel on top of you. Like, really? Fuck right off.

Imagine if Rogues couldn't stealth until after a duel started.

---
Missing poop bucket.
---
As said above, you probably need runecloth turn-ins. You can get pretty far if you start questing straight away in the intended zone, but exalted, that's a bit further. I don't know about Forsaken reputation totals (only have Gnomeregan/Stormwind experience in vanilla), but if I recall correctly it was a bit over half of the exalted bar you have to finish in the end with materials.
---
Ahh make sense
---
(Inferno Effect intensifies)
---
I use diapers, poop socks are nasty.
---
Now hear me. Until recently I couldn't decide whether to play Warlock or Mage, checking out both classes on private servers, but suddenly I knew. There is no way I could play Mage, Warlock is the choice all the way... for the weirdest possible reason. I don't want to play Mage BECAUSE he has teleports.
---
Why you might ask? It doesn't make sense. Teleports are considered one of strongest perks of mages. And yet... it does. Remember the zeppelins between Undercity and Orgrimmar, or boats between Teldrassil and Menethil? As a mage you won't see them... ever. There is no point. Teleport is faster. Instead of running back through wilderness after completing a quest you can pop into main city in few seconds, always. There is another game that allows you to skip "annoyances" with teleports. It's called BfA. I'm joining Classic to leave BfA behind. I'm not playing Classic for quality of life features. Mage in Vanilla has in-built QoL features. Playing Mage would mean intentionally skipping content that I waited years to experience.
---
Back in BC I considered teleports an amazing ability. Everybody did. Same as they did with flying... and other "features" that ultimately deleted immersion from the game. At this moment I can't help but consider them a part of slippery slope that ruined the main game forever.
---
the rotation that changes with every weapon upgrade you get, and which still includes trinket swapping, melee weaving, yes pet management still matters and you should plan to keep pet alive as much as you can etc.
---
It's much more complicated and skill expressive than you seem to know.
---
LFM Adderall
---
I'm planning to main a 31/13/7 Holy Paladin. All the big talents raids want you to have for healing (Holy Shock, free spells on crit, and improved mana regen from Blessing of Wisdom) *also i*increase my damage output and mana efficiency in PvP fights and general grinding. The shield talents from Protection let me AoE farm with a Crest of Retribution shield too. All I need is two different sets of gear in my bags for +healing vs +spell damage to swap between.
---
This is what we call bias its good to have perspective and like I said I play a warrior not a hunter, but come on it's not even close. It changes based on what buffs / random procs they have up and the speed of their current weapons.
---
I dont think 7-16 year old would be so interested of classic wow, which was created before they were even born
---
Why the understatement? ALL classic raids are easier.
---
That is, in a purely mechanical sense.
---
However, you have 40man raid logistics, consumables (which are mandatory for everything beyond entry-level BWL), limited gold, limited access to gear, limited player pool (no xrealm), and the social dynamics of your realm (no finder, you have to talk to people).
---
When people like you think of "difficulty" you only consider fight mechanics. Those are indeed trivial in Vanilla. But in Classic, fight mechanics are a minor part of the game. And the rest, most of which ceased to exist in retail, isn't easy, as most people who think they will "rock" classic, will soon find out.
---
I feel bad for people that are so mad while watching streamers that they make a reddit post about it.
---
How pathetic you are little man
---
This is just you being bitter. Because you don't like him. He is in fact a leader. He takes people places in the world. Organizes events and engages with his audience. You just don't like him because you aren't in his target audience range. Next you'll shit on blues clues for not being cerebral enough lol.
---
I imagine he meant using mana -&gt; life tap -&gt; eat. I've hardly played warlock so I don't know what leveling one is like, but that's what I imagine he was trying to say.
---
Honest question, are any of these actually good reads? I've heard likewise.
---
1. they roll on ya gear.  more importantly, they are not a competitive class in pve.
---
2. pretty good in pvp
---
Pr√≠vate servrREEEeEeEeEeEeEeEeeeee

Unbreakable himself was a mouse clicker
---
And now we know that the majority of your raid having Goblin Sapper Charges completely trivializes certain fights like Viscidus or some of the trash packs in Naxx, that were either nearly guaranteed wipes or required a lot more gear than they do now.
---
Awesome, didnt know quests had different color codes for difficulty
---
Posting as a reminder to download Wallpaper Engine when I get home
---
Okay. This was years ago in older videos where he railed on it.
---
&gt; It's a really easy class to pick up but I'd argue it has one of the highest skill caps in the game.
---
And you'd be 100% correct.
---
It‚Äôs a game. Literally everything you do is a ‚Äúwaste of time.‚Äù That‚Äôs the whole point.
---
Will my subscription to bfa carry over to classic? Or are they separate? I don‚Äôt wanna spend another 15 dollars
---
You would be very wrong. He got his audience hype for classic. His audience found him in retail. For the events he organized and the stuff he gets people to do. Like mount offs and world exploration. Again I'll say I dn't personally love him but, I'm not his target demo.

This must be like the 4th time you've posted this, or more. No one gives a shit, and take another downvote

That‚Äôs true, but I found that the speed people wanted to speed run them to get max chests at the end made them (understandably), so i didn‚Äôt really enjoy it. Also if anyone died or caused the group any delays, it was a constant ‚Äúkick x player‚Äù or constant whining in chat, etc.
---
At the top levels of play and gear nothing really is "laughably bad". Might be less than optimal or not up to its old capabilities, but laughably bad is a stretch.
---
Hey, have you ran the addon any more?  
---
Would like to know the population ratio between alliance and horde. Because in vanilla most servers were 1:2 ratio of alliance:horde and it was the reason why we rolled alliance (more world PvP).
---
Was it beta or stress test?
---
Well you are always gonna lose south after items because you have x amount of healers needed. They all need the same big items. 
---
As for tier it can suck yeah, but because tier is kinda mediocre unless if stacked, so you can decide if you want to be tier focused or just individual heal pieces focused. That helps splitting up shaman loot better.
---
Yup, I Re-subscribed just so I could level in Azeroth just to scratch the itch. I've got 10 level 20s now lol
---
Yeah and that's still 200 stacks of runecloth.
---
I played Everquest.  Tanking in WoW was a breeze comparatively.  I disliked when they removed Taunt from costing 5 rage and instead had a cooldown.
---
&gt; This isn't spell batching
---
I know it isn't. But it's also an outdated mechanic that makes classic gameplay feel like authentic classic gameplay
---
&gt; This doesn't do anything in a caster vs caster fight.
---
Yes it does! You'll miss lots of frost novas, howls of terrors etc for instance
---
&gt; It doesn't have a presence in every PvP encounter like spell batching does.
---
Again. It does
---
&gt; It existed. It's probably going to exists.
---
And I'm glad. I want the same experience I had back then. With all its pros and cons.
---
I distinctly remember buying a winged helm off the auction house for my rogue because I liked the way it looked. It def has intel and spirit. The rest of my gear was solid, not sure of my thought process on that one.
---
Horde is expected to out number alliance by a lot so it‚Äôs not a straight cut on the other classes.
---
For 5 less rage and almost the same threat, don't forget shield bash!
---
TBC would be the cheapest thing to do for Blizzard, and they have been making a lot of decision making that revolves around hiring less people (loot trading/right click report+automation means less GMs, sharding/layering means less servers and less people needed to maintain said servers).  I have no doubt that they would move into the next expansion.
---
I also just don't see what they could add that would make sense to vanilla. 
---
If they add post naxx raiding, then 5 man content just outright dies because there will be people who could practically start soloing some of them (naxx40 gear was already insane, I remember naxx guilds 3 manning scholo way faster than 5 man pugs ever could dream of doing).  Having a climb in gear quality will cause extreme issues, as was the original fear of the devs back then. 
---
If they do "horizontal" content like I keep seeing people mention.. then what in the world could they add that would feel meaningful?  More 5 mans?  Why?  Every 5 man has more than enough gear to choose from to get set up pre raid as it is, so any new dungeon they add would simply be adding items that are copying others, just with a different skin.  
---
The game isn't quite set up like runescape was.  In OSRS, it doesn't matter how much content they add, because the core of the game is to make gold and level up skills that can take actual years of intense grinding to achieve.  Even the "raid gear" tends to be situational in that game (apart from a bow that exists) or has a downside like costing gold to use.  
---
So while I can understand why so many people would love to see it happen, I just don't think it is practical.  TBC is the only real option they have.  
---
With that said, I don't think people would care too much if they changed TBC a bit, because it was the true beginning of the end with how they handled catch up content; though I doubt they would outright get rid of flying or anything like that.
---
He is an entertainer and just that. He is good as the game, more or less. And funny (depending on your sense of fun obviously).
---
Some watch streamers for skill (like I do with some overwatch streamers) and Some for entertainment.
---
You would be surprised with some of the cringey nostalgiacs in here.
---
Not sure, I stared the install before I left for work. I'll find out when I get home in a couple hours.

"I hate what the game designers and developers have done to World of Warcraft, they ruined retail."
---
Also you:
---
"I hope those same game designers and developers who I say ruined retail World of Warcraft design new content for Classic!"
---
Don't. Just don't.
---
No problem it‚Äôs a big decision in vanilla. Enhancement is RNG reliant for sure. I mained other melee classes in vanilla and other expansions (war in van and ret in TBC-WotLK) so I didn‚Äôt feel the need to melee on Shaman. That said, my guild leader was a High Warlord enhancement shaman and he had fond memories. 
---
Enhancement is far from boring at 60 and in PvP. There are certain drawbacks of the spec for sure. You will struggle against some classes that have more tools to keep you at distance. You will have to bind certain important totems to allow you to survive burst or allow you to gap close/break cc. But the class is doable and can be very fun. Keep in mind that the RNG fantasy won‚Äôt come online till later in the game as you don‚Äôt get WF till 30 and Stormstrike at 41.  All said, it‚Äôs very satisfying to watch someone melt when all your procs align. 
---
What content are you looking to prioritize?
---
I think you‚Äôll find most people on this sub in support of the original spec/class design, even with its obvious warts. And as OP mentioned, hybrid specs are a thing. However I think a much better idea of class identity AND balance is TBC. I don‚Äôt think they ever made every spec so valuable yet also so unique with their own quirks.

I don't trust these polls. The results are always worlds apart from reality both in retail vanilla and on private servers. If you look at the stats from the current biggest pserver, it's over 20% warrios and just 6% shamans. On that server, shaman is the third least played class on horde, ahead of only druid and priest.
---
For leveling i'd say hunter, but if you plan on doing dungeons, probably something like paladin, warlock or mage since micromanaging the pet will be an impediment at first.
---
I don't have more data, but I'll be able to run it again in a few hours with the new stress test ;)
---
Playing on private servers to test out the classes leveling experience right now.
---
ur like the only one who gets it lol
---
Heh, I thought I didn't use Tidal Charm back then but now that you mentioned Arathi I immediately visualised farming it. That has to be like a 10 years old memory.
---
Gathering professions are a great way to be able to afford your mount. Herbalism and Mining funded my first few mounts; it doesn‚Äôt have to be the high-level stuff, either. I remember copper bars going for a gold apiece (which was a LOT back then) and for my first mount, I just made laps in Stonetalon.
---
He‚Äôs a weirdo, sure, but I didn‚Äôt see a single racist thing in any of his comments or posts, not sure where you‚Äôre getting that from? Granted, I‚Äôm a fucking weirdo too but that makes up most of the Reddit users anyway...
---
&gt; assuming a pretty even split of A:H
---
It's possibly even worse than that because there does seem to be a faction imbalance in favor of Alliance. So your 15% warriors example is actually divided like 9:6 Alliance to Horde. So Horde Shamans would outnumber Horde warriors like 8:6. Using those numbers.
---
lmao. your first sentence sounds like a hunter not a mage.
---
I did exactly the same thing. Male dwarf hair can be pretty unruly.
---
Replace drain with burn
---
No they dont. Tank nor healer gear does not help with dps checks, and there are quite a few of those nowadays
---
20/20/11 so you can be versatile!
---
Do you plan on AOE farming or not?
---
It changes some points a bit, I like going with something that can both aoe farm and solo farm, because aoe farm is better but only if you have the spot. 
---
Something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0VZZVhMhsfpho 40 points in frost then go arcane, finish up either with more arcane or more frost.
---
Seems to be different in bgs when finding FCs on the beta currently. Def not the best but its something small
---
The last I heard was that they stated that it was based on a fork of the 7.3.5 Legion client, but yeah if it runs BFA it will run Classic for sure!
---
I hated the Atiesh retcon because I was one of the few that had one in classic and I loved having the ability to teleport to Karazhan because it made travel time a lot quicker to move between continents since Booty Bay was fairly close by.
---
Gotta guess that its a stress test as the next one starts tomorrow
---
Ton of shamans gonna reroll off class when they realize they just a heal bot and their dreams of enhance are never gonna happen. Warriors also prolly won't be as popular as people thing. Outside of the neck beard community. They aren't super popular.
---
then you are unstoppable. God speed /u/UbiGeofram
---
Can you log into the beta server or?
---
&gt; Links to polls?
---
~20,000 votes on each of these:
---
https://www.strawpoll.me/18053669/r
---
https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/
---
In both cases Shaman scores at the bottom of *total* classes, but considering a rough 50/50 split of factions that actually puts them at the top of the Horde proportionally.
---
U can play to lvl 20 without a sub though?
---
You can just get an addon for this probably within the first week.
---
I've never done AoE farming, but it seems fun and pretty OP so I would definitely want to do that
---
i dont really care, i just dont think they realize streaming 1-30 content 8 hours a day is gonna burn them out...so when the game finally releases they are gonna hate playing it. Of course the 30-60 will be unlocked before then, but 3 months is a long time if you're streaming all day every day. I just feel bad cuz although they are loving it now I think they underestimate the burnout potential. Im just making an observation is all.
---
I've mained hunter for 10+ years. If this guy wanted to talk about hunters I'd be talking about hunters. 
---
Mages are pretty cool too, though. Much cooler than Warlocks.
---
God Bless America.
---
That I can aggree with.
---
TBC IMO was the best phase of WoW ever. But then I'd rather support a TBC server after a couple years of classic than changing classic OSRS style.
---
In case people still wonder why big streamers are so despised around here...the constant low-effort, clickbaiting trashposts of their fandrones may have something to do with that.
---
TBC launch was why people loved it.  I would argue most people couldn't care less about the second year, and the vast majority of people either didn't do sunwell, or truly didn't enjoy it if they did (my entire guild was kind of bored by the time we finally cleared it).
---
Karazhan, gruuls lair and magtheridon were epic beyond anyone's imagination, and they introduced mechanics that were not only a new challenge (mostly), but fun as well... though some may argue magtheridon was true hell to learn for a casual guild.  
---
The biggest issue I could see with going to TBC would be changing the raid size from 40, back down to 25.  This time around.. if they announced going into TBC, then guilds already know what happened back then, and that they might as well reform as soon and as quickly as possible leading into the expansion.  Guilds were absolutely destroyed in the transition back then.
---
To be fair, pets are the worst and required so much micromanaging just to get them *to attack a boss' back* that you would often welcome a spec that didn't rely on pet damage in endgame.
---
Eh, if a shaman had an issue with that, they deserve some serious side-eye. Most classes have to cough up silver to pay for all sorts of reagents but ankh is the only one I can think of for Shaman. If we can soulstone the priest and let the shaman ankh, that‚Äôs two separate people who can res. In any wipe, one might be closer to the mobs and would pull/die, or maybe it‚Äôs best to have two separate reses for in-combat use.
---
Frost is probably the best for leveling, just in terms of being a consistent and even curve as you go. Fire is only really viable once you get good gear, and arcane is pretty much just a support tree for your other choices of frost or fire. 
---
BC made fire-mage really fun, but in vanilla, really the most viable spec is frost, expect to be throwing a lot of frost bolts out during raids, like a lot a lot. I was considering playing mage myself, but decided against it, when I realized how basic the "rotation" is in end-game content. Mage is VERY fun to level though, you will pretty much not have to worry about traveling from main-city to main-city after about 20, playing with portals is the shit.
---
dear diary...where the fuck is Mankrik's wife? SERIOUSLY WHERE THE FUCK IS SHE?!
---
Same man, played some private server but its not the same. All i want is classic live so i can play games again.
---
I had a glimmer of hope to get a beta key, and from what i've read you need to be subscribed to get one
---
Undead ;)
---
And here I am trying to decide between warlock and priest ü§î
---
Exactly my plan!
---
I have played both sides off and on since I started in '05. Each has their merit, but I can appreciate those who are staunch supporters of their chosen faction. I just like seeing both sides of the stories where possible.
---
Those are perfectly fine specs to heal with. Unless you're really pushing hard on "world firsts" healing specs can be kind of flexible
---
CK2 has ruined me. Nothing will be as in depth as that game.
---
Not doing av during weekends for sure then!
---
Problem with this is that GW2 has horizontal progression with barely any stat increases after hitting max and getting max gear and runes in while WoW has straight up vertical progression. They would have to rework every piece of gear and raid at 60 to do this. 
---
I'd love for it as well, but sadly it's a huge endeavor and I highly doubt that Blizzard would put man hours into it.
---
Fuck them. Play what you want and have fun! All classes are viable in their own way.
---
I think the only concern going into TBC would be the guild raiding restructure. 
---
So many guilds outright died going from 40/20 mans into 25/10 mans.  The math didn't even make sense... blizzard completely jumped the gun with that and had no regard for the community's feelings on the subject.
---
Hi, /u/RedFactoryDev
---
OMEGALUL! That was EPIC. You gotta love the super funny classic streamers like Asmongold
---
Maybe that‚Äôs what he means but I guess he spams shadow bolt and that‚Äôs counterintuitive when you could apply 2 dots and wand using no mana and killing just as efficiently.
---
Min/maxers aren't screwing themselves over. They will just run the dungeons they need to until they get their gear. Then in raid, will bid DKP or roll on upgrades and BIS items against other people who need it too (this applies to casual guilds as well).
---
Pretty simple really. Getting BIS is pretty much the same as just raiding a lot. You won't get every item instantly, but eventually, you'll get there.
---
This is mindblowing, needs sticky and more exposure. Also please apply for a job at Blizzard.
---
And most guilds won't care unless they're hardcore.
---
And with 2/2 fleet footed, I think it bumped it up 115% passive run speed/100% stealth speed.
---
I could be wrong on that as I‚Äôm not sure exactly how they stacked.
---
So many posers in his wake.
---
Absolutely. It is possible that Blizz could astonish the entire community and make perfect horizontal content for Classic, that is new and refreshing, yet old and appropriate... but there‚Äôs just SO MANY factors that could make the game worse as a whole. TBC is the obvious, cost effective option.
---
My PC case looks similar to that and I legit have a recliner for a game chair. I'm 2/5th of the way there.
---
&gt;This is the hardest decision I've ever had to make
---
If you don't mind my asking, what have you done with your life so far?
---
Well a 40man raid can take 8 shamans (20%) so Im not so worried with my choice of a Tauren Shaman resto healer ;) And judging by this reddit most shamans believe they will raid as enh. Soooo good luck with that.
---
I forgot this today. And I'm gone tomorrow. Um, I will try and remember it on Thursday. Please feel free to PM me and remind me if you don't hear from me. I'd like to make this happen
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/uTAk9lo
---
Sorry I was referring to vanilla servers not retail. In vanilla it is important that your tanks do not die and your healers have as much mana as possible, after that you can pump everything into your dps.
---
Lol choose whatever gender you are in real life. Easy.

I started sewing at the beginning of the year, and even though it's only been six months, I still find new things to improve and adjust each time I make another dice bag. Doesn't matter how many times you do this, you'll always find something new to tweak and improve. I look forward to seeing the next project.
---
(w)PvP mainly. I'll try to delve into everything, since I've never played vanilla, and my WoW experience overall is somewhat lacking. Also thanks again for the detailed presentation of the spec! I love the theme of a melee using magic and it's good to know that in practice it's not lacking either! 
---
You haven't mentioned what you will be playing and why? Will you go warrior once again?
---
There is plenty of love for hunters, but at the same time I also know it's really just jealousy from all the other classes for all the really cool things and utility we can provide.  
---
Glad there isn't nearly as many as I expected on the latest straw poll.  I really loathe rolling overplayed classes.
---
Just to clarify: not during leveling
---
You're assuming it won't be on cooldown at the start of the next raid.
---
To all the people who are rolling paladin at launch: thank you for providing me with target practice and free kills. Really appreciate it :)
---
There were still things in t4 that t6 raiders sometimes still wanted, especially in regards to gruul and kz.  
---
Keep in mind that the only real reason an aq/naxx 40 guild keeps MC in their line up, is because you have to do it for legendary weapons.   So all they'd have to do is have more legendary choices that require the running of kz and it would be exactly the same.
---
As you said yourself, frost is your best shot.
---
Now, even with the choice narrowed down to frost, you still have 2 options to choose from. You have a single-target oriented build (which is also better pvp wise) and a aoe oriented build.
---
With the aoe build, you can efficiently tear down loads of mobs at once (granted they are meele) with kiting them, blizzard and cone of cold.
---
With the ST build you aim to quickly take down single or a pair of mobs at max, with keeping them at distance with frostbite procs.
---
Now, depending on when you are planning on leveling, I for one will go the ST build, seeing as places will be very crowded and you wont get many chances to pull loads of mobs before anyone else tagged them.
---
100% agree.
---
I'm not sure those polls will represent the larger population.
---
they should just remove tauren from the horde. they are disgusting animals that are not civilized.
---
I think his point is arguments like these aren't valid for ruining certain aspects of the game that many others enjoyed, and was the exact reason everything we've all loved about WoW went to shit. The reason the game was great (other than the community which died after WOTLK imo) was because a lot of the goals were unattainable...there was a true sense of adventure seeing someone on a Zulean Tiger, or knowing that less than 1% of the playerbase ever got to see the inside of Naxxramas. There was always something to strive towards and achieving rare goals made the game exciting and wonderful.
---
can clear that easy content with 30
---
To make things worse, smart guilds will try to award 3 pieces of T2 to a single shaman since the set bonus is insane and BIS for all of classic (and TBC until it was nerfed).
---
Hopefully you get lucky with helms and legs before BWL.
---
Fair point.
---
Yet the devs themselves likely don't want sharding/layering and understand that community is important.
---
Yet someone signs their paycheck at the end of the day.
---
It's a Paradox game. It's nowhere near complete. It will be great in the future though.
---
I gotta say his reaction faces on the thumbnails are every bit as awful as the buzzfeed title plague on youtube. I fucking hate this. Am I just too old for this sensationalist crap?

---
I'm sure if they had more time, they would have made distinct spells for each race if shaman, sort of what they did with Priest racials
---
Did they re-add boob bounce?
---
its almost like theyre talking about leveling play not boss fights which account for 1% of the game
---
a "leader" in what playing video games and video taping it live? WTF is this nonsense, this person is in the right place at the right time in history for simple minded boring people to watch. Leader of televising the playing of video games LOLOLOL 4
---
If it's slower it's not more efficient. You can 2 shot L58 mobs with a shadow bolt. Kill 10, life tap, eat food.
---
I may give it a go. $60 is a lot too. I keep telling myself that so I don't spend it and get dissapointed when I lose interest.
---
Block user. See ya
---
This. It can be done, just make a full group with high leveled friends to cut your xp gain from the quests down and make sure its one of the last things you do.
---
You're talking about twinking though...so I guess friends are out of the question. Have fun being lame and bad at the game!
---
Damn that's a brilliant idea, I've been looking for something to quench my Classic thirst.
---
Just beta test on a private classic server. It‚Äôs free and instant.
---
Mage or Warlock. Warlocks start strong and scale the best into the later phases of Vanilla. They also bring unique utility in the form of soulstone, healthstone, summoning, and curses. Mages also have great damage and utility with portals, food, polymorph. Don‚Äôt play a rogue. Everyone will roll a rogue and without a dedicated dungeon group you might be passed over quite a bit.
---
That's your opinion.  Sounds like you've always been a solo player and been left behind a lot.
---
No man. Gotta be a lady. You're going to be looking at that backside for probably 20+ days /played.
---
Frost is just dandy especially if you are on a pvp server
---
Buddy. He doesn't come up with anything. Esfand is like "we could do this" so asmon goes "okay guys LET'S DO THIS", you got some kind of dumb-tinted glasses on if you think this guy is a leader... But you're right, I'm not in the target audience that watches a guy reacting to videos all day haha
---
Yeah they aren't bad either
---
Why would you miss more abilities with leeway? The whole point is it gives leeway. 
---
Most people are just going to assume they are lagging. It's not really adding much to the game tbh. It's probably just going to be abused.
---
I tried Europa 4 for a few hours and couldn't really get into it either. I know if I dedicated the time to it I would, but getting to point where I don't feel like I'm just looking at a colorful map kills me
---
where is fleet footed, i can't find it in the talent calculator?
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue)
---
I played Enh Shaman as my first char in Vanilla.  I went from Twig of the World Tree to Unstoppable Force and couldn't get enough of those bursts of numbers.  Its definitely fun, and how fun the procs are make up for all white hits.  Also, it's not like you'll just be standing there waiting for WF procs, you'll be chasing people around spamming frost shock, purge, and earthbind/grounding totem while insta-shifting in and out of ghost wolf like a druid and tossing heals off to whoever happens to be close by.
---
You make him sound like the pied piper of hamelin.
---
Instead start a "fuck this place" war with rural Australia, and bet on Australia winning!
---
Free money
---
Thats your opinion.
---
Warlocks require the most skill in my opinion. You'll have to be more creative to beat people, but when you do you'll feel like a god. Especially when you beat a rogue. You'll also level pretty fast with a lock.
---
Mages are true glass cannons and are wanted in pvp and pve. A good mage will burst you to 50% before you realize. A skilled player with a mage is a pain because they're slippery, ranged and burst. Mages are also the best aoe farmers from my experience. A mage with T1 or T2 farming tyr's hand or the other scarlet crusade town will make good gold.
---
Now rogues. Ok, rogues are slow to level initially, but holy shit, stealth and backstab. A good rogue will have people wanting to riot in pvp. It's the funniest and most frustrating experience depending which side you're on. However once you understand how they work you won't fear getting ganked. Two or three skilled rogues loitering around goldshire will make all of stormwind come looking for you. In vanilla a rogue with dungeon set blues was a nightmare.
---
Not to level any alts. This will be the true test.
---
Remove Instanced PVP. 
---
You have to rank up by fights in the world.
---
It's exhausting though. As a 21point Disc Priest I have 3 buffs per person
---
I have a reasonable idea every 15 years or so, my last one was getting vanilla lol
---
And what kind of new content?  
---
New raids?  Post naxx40 raids that would increase the item level even more to the point of being completely broken?  Naxx40 stuff was already insane.  
---
New 5 mans?  The existing 5 mans have all the gear choices needed and then more that are unneeded.  So new 5 mans would basically just be for levelers, because end game ones are absolutely not needed unless they remove items from the game.
---
So basically it would just boil down to more battlegrounds... we've seen how that goes.
---
I could see it going either way. Probably would make it defacto pvp pet, definitely make it an amazing solo play pet. Stun immunity and it‚Äôs a bat so it has claw and screech iirc.
---
Bro, I'm in the same boat. I keep reading that Witcher 3 is right up my damn alley. But I can't put more than 15 mins into before I go to something else.
---
Assassins Creed Origins and Odyssey have held my interest though.
---
GoT meme.
---
It's a lot of fun indeed, and when you got the spot and in the zone not dying, it's amazingly OP.
---
That's fair, history repeats itself lol
---
Did you afk at all to eat or use bathroom?
---
What differences in talents do you make between AoE and ST? Is it just Frostbite? Improved Blizzard?
---
Getting them with logic won't work, sadly.
---
Isn't that exactly how classic is going to be in phase one?
---
Or get over it and watch the Asmongold videos because they are high quality &amp; tend to have engaging content, regardless if you find him enjoyable as a personality.

I remember when I finally got the frost mage multiple mob pull down and you could handle 4 or 5. But one slight underestimate on range of frost nova or slow on blink and boom, it was over.
---
This. I leveled a Priest back in the day, didn‚Äôt know what to do next so rolled a Paly. By the time I got him to 60, TBC was a week away.
---
Completely disagree that they will ever turn current retail WoW into anything remotely like it was before.  
---
Classic has now given them a bucket that will catch the spillover.  Why completely alienate your new market at this stage?  They would sooner do a WoW 2.
---
I respect the indecision you have
---
Another thing to consider is this is a launch of a fresh batch of servers, with low spawn rates, and high populations. It won't be like a pserver where there is no mob competition and such. I see a lot of people getting frustrated the first day just from sheer lack of mobs to kill, and you won't be able to just quest somewhere else because everywhere is going to be crowded.
---
Shaman had Lightning Shield, Purge, and Blood Lust.
---
Things like Healing Ward were from witch doctors, and it seems like healing Ward was the inspiration for stuff like healing stream totem.
---
Enhancement seems like they just completely made it up.  Honestly the transition from WC3 shamans to WoW shamans doesn't make much sense.
---
Then again not much actually makes sense of the transition.
---
&gt; Am I just too old for this sensationalist crap?
---
No, but you were born with a curse that will haunt you for your entire life:  
---
A functioning brain.
---
It will cause you great misery, by giving you an unfiltered, unbiased, and analytical point of view on the world, which will reveal all it's nastiness and absurdity to you. Worse, it will make you realize how the people around you act this way day in and day out, and you will be completely and utterly powerless to do anything about it.

Yeah, and ironically they want you to spend more time in the game, but encourage people to do everything at max speed (mythical, even if it‚Äôs non-mythic and it‚Äôs just about re-runs in a certain time period). This creates a direction where people reach end game so fast that they are left asking ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the content?‚Äù.

If the game was much harder and required more careful approaches, I think it would be much better.

Is your off-hand weapon that epic from Zul'Farrak?
---
Okay, I see a lot of people saying Dual Spec. I understand why you want it and I understand it‚Äôs convenient. As someone who plans on going warrior tank, even I have to admit it would be nice so I can switch to Arms with the aesthetically pleasing two-hander.

BUT! I really think that would actually hurt the community more than some people realize. Tanks and healers are highly coveted, especially in the leveling stages. Yes, you can tank without being prot specced (in the leveling stages) but not as well as the warrior who is prot spec. Same with healers, a shadow priest can heal but it‚Äôs easier with the priest who went holy. Now, the reason I think it would hurt is because the players who decide to level that way are going to want to group. It‚Äôs so much easier for them if they have a damage spec who can deal the damage while they heal you or the tank holds aggro so you don‚Äôt have to worry about pulling too many mobs and not having enough health to tank it or having a tank for an elite mob. That person then decides to add you to their friends list and now you have someone who is a critical role for the dungeoning experience, making it easier for you to get in that group. So instead of waiting in trade chat for an hour, you message your new friend and you‚Äôre good to go. Making friends and building a community is part of the classic WoW experience. It benefits you to make friends in vanilla and if everyone can dual spec their way in, why make friends? You can just pug your way through everything the same way you can in retail, because you‚Äôre going to want a proper tank and healer for dungeons like BRD and Dire Maul. I‚Äôm not shitting on you for wanting dual spec, because I understand the convenience of it, but I want people to see why I THINK it would be a bad idea to implement it.
---
Personally, the one thing I would like implemented from retail is archaeology but completely revamped to have more lore in it. I think it would be a neat feature to have.
---
&gt; It gives flavor and make people be committed to their class
---
No it doesn't. You can change any time it just costs you.
---
&gt; Giving everything away for free just make everything less valuable.
---
Sure it's fine to have limits, but the way it's limited in vanilla is extremely punishing in terms of experimentation and gameplay. It's how it's going to be, but it's still not that great of a system.
---
He has 35k kids following him around. That's a pretty good analogy to be honest.
---
&gt;Fuck those cows.
---
Thaaaaaaat came across very wrong...
---
Yeah who knows, I see the strategic advantage to #NoChanges. Its a version of the game we can all agree upon, one that is definitively "Classic". Its also the best way to get CTBC -- The Holy Grail. 
---
Classic reboots were going to start with Vanilla or not at all. 
---
Each and every person has things they would like changed to classic, thats why these threads come up. But someones "no gameplay QOL change" is a gamebreaking immersion reducing disruption to someone else. So #NoChanges is something we can all get behind. 
---
I cant tell if those who mindlessly parrot no changes are trolls or idiots.
---
I might not be able to level to 60 on time.
---
Raptors are the coolest mounts on the Horde faction and you want to trade yours in for ....a dead horse?

Lol, OK.

WoW should've had different balance approaches for PvE and PvP a long time ago. Glad they're doing it now. If only their tooltipp game would be spot on now, to showcase difference depending on content...
---
Huh?
---
being able to customize your own channel, videos were rated by stars, comment section was way better too. Fuck google+
---
Random thought experiment: To what extent would you be overpowered if you had the ability to learn every single talent in all three trees? I think it would fun to mess around with something like that, but that's probably more of a pvirate srveer thing.
---
It sounds like you should not have been an officer.
---
Asmon doesn‚Äôt post his own videos though, it‚Äôs not his fault if you find the titles and thumbnails obnoxious
---
The dungeon loot needs players to upload information via the Wowhead Client, not through the datamining which allows us to add items and spells to the site. If nobody running dungeons uses the client, then we don't get information on exact sources and drop %.
---
I made a post on the subreddit a few days ago and people generally seemed excited about the client updates, but especially for the level 20-30 content we need more people uploading to get exact information!

Sharding isn't cross realm.  Particularly if sharding is the solution to overpopulation.  You're not going to be pulling people in from other realms because you have too many people on the current realm.  Where do people even get that ridiculous idea?
---
Just because the tech works with the cross realm tech in BFA doesn't mean that sharding implies cross realm zones.  It was never even floated that way by the devs.
---
Dude I've done it. Like, a lot.

Racist bigot
---
&gt;Was this a rare occasion or mostly how AVs used to go?
---
No, it wasn't.
---
AV games that lasted for several hours were actually pretty common. Not as common, but still something you could see regularly, were games lasting for **SEVERAL DAYS**.
---
2 hours is actually on the short end of things.
---
Leaders rarely do come up with anything. Generally a leader is just the guy who moves first. What makes Esfand not a leader is he suggests. While Asmon implements. I feel like you guys are taking me saying Asmogold is a leader. As me saying the dude is Julius Ceasar. He's not he's just a leader. All you have to do to lead is move on an idea first. Which he does. Then 35k kids follow.
---
Most of us played the **** out of this game and couldn't imagine playing it again because there have been so many times in the past where we were had wow burn out.  
---
I'm looking forward to it because I don't enjoy current wow, at least as a "wow" game.  It feels a lot like an open world Diablo where as Preach put you basically destroy hordes of enemies combined with a little bit of customization in talents and gear...but D3:RoS does it better.
---
not my fault you play an inferior species. go make me some milk
---
You made a post literally about watching YouTube videos about Classic WoW. So unless you have a Beta Invite, you are watching footage of someone playing beta. And if you are watching a Video without gameplay, I question your sense of entertainment.

With faster dynamic respawns and more people than a regular Vanilla server.
---
Oh man I though this was serious and I felt bad for a second.
---
Fire is best in 5 mans for raw damage, but frost makes leveling a lot safer, plus you are pigeonholed into frost for raiding MC/ony/BWL anyway :\
---
Personally, I will probably just do fire because I enjoy it a lot more, but it is hard to deny the importance of the frost tree.
---
If you're already sub to bfa you get access to classic for free
---
Normally the tool tip will say "exp or honor" iirc. I would surmise that this will not work based on your description of the tool tip
---
To be fair only the females are cows....
---
You forget a lot of players don't know how the real world works.
---
I absolutely loved them. I twinked 49 and I remember one time being attacked by two players at once while defending the black smith alone at Aretha basin. I mind blasted, dotted them, feared, mind flayed, and used regen, shields, pots, trinkets and flash heal to stay alive. I beat them both. Then a third guy came right after as the fight ended and I beat him as well. A teammate who was running toward the black smith saw most of the fight and he was like ‚Äúholy shit man, you‚Äôre insane‚Äù. Such an awesome feeling. Shadow Priests are super fun and they definitely feel powerful. 
---
I think I‚Äôm rolling Druid this time (so I likely won‚Äôt have that same sense of power lol) but I may roll a shadow priest again as a female troll, just to recreate this experience.
---
It might seem small, but I think the feeling of clicking on the individual corpse to find that sweet loot is really significant from an RPG perspective. When I returned to check out WoD I was so bummed to discover that bosses weren't lootable, and the game just randomly assigned someone a reward. There's something special about rummaging through the shiny corpse.
---
The joke being, that most people make the joke because of how well known it is.
---
LMFAO this has to be a troll, no?
---
There were PLENTY of times you'd log out at 1am, sleep, wake up at 8-9am and log back in and queue into the same AV.
---
Holy shit that's a fucking throwback to old school you tube poop.
---
^  This guy is prepared for classic with that 2005 meme meta.
---
Check out this update I made a few days ago on the topic :)
---
TLDR Wowhead Client is up and running for Classic, and TONS of NPC and Quest related info is powered by the Client, not datamining.
---
We appreciate everyone using it and spreading the word! A lot of the starting zone and lower level NPCs are starting to get filled in, but more people means greater accuracy, especially on higher-level content.
---
Unfortunately, the 30-60 content won't yet be filled in as nobody can play it yet, but the client will process the data instantly as soon as it opens.
---
I save my bubble hearth for when I run on top of the org bank
---
I didnt go into depth. I did say my brother and other officers plead my case. We had wiped 12 times and people were dicking around in discord and prolly missed my explanation of how we should call it. The officers also all voted to call it. I had to be the bad guy
---
Frost is only required in MC/ony/BWL due to resists.  Fire always outdamaged frost at 60 with preraid gear alone, in 5 mans. 
---
Fire in AQ40 and naxx40 was easily the highest damage output.  If resists weren't a factor, then frost would only be used for leveling/farming.
---
They have the data. Not disputable.
---
They have the numbers. Not disputable. 
---
They compared the numbers. Not disputable.
---
The numbers are consistent. Not disputable.
---
End of the discussion.
---
Cheers
---
I feel like when you hear leader you think "Julius Caesar" Because he's a balls on mega leader. Asmogold is just a regular leader. All you have to do to lead is move first. The idea you move on doesn't have to be yours. All you have to do is move. If 35k kids follow. You just became a leader. If you do it day after day, you are by definition a leader. Again though. Saying he's a leader is not the same as saying hes a world breaker.
---
I have a feeling that people will vastly underestimate the early raid content (Thinking specifically BWL here). And I think it will cause some frustration.
---
People that know what they are doing should breeze through untill AQ40/Naxx I would imagine.
---
Been playing morhau and D2 prepping for the new release on tuesday! On top of that I got into LH to test out some classic content and not be as shell shocked from wow retail to classic.
---
That would make sense and what I was thinking. I was just watching some videos of priest pvp coming from private servers and it seems to work for them but I know they have different coding
---
You're jobs a joke, you're broke
---
PoM fire is an insane pvp build as well, especially in those 1v1 situations where you can just get a free burst kill if someone screws with you.
---
The more you say the sadder and more entertaining it is, lol. Sorry you're so bent out of shape by it dude!! Clearly hit a sore spot lol.

Oh God msn messenger.

On the other hand, I've seen things that should never sit in a guild's storage for as long as the did because people couldn't easily view the contents ingame.

Shouldn't proc off pvp as pvp doesn't grant experience.

But it will work off killing green or higher mobs at 60 eventhough you are exp capped

Clap. Clap. Clap. Clap

being able to monetize video game streaming should be outlawed in my opinion. It  does nothing good for society.
---
What you're saying is not true. Legion wasn't a huge piece of garbage in 7.1.5. as BfA is now, I'm sorry but if you like BfA this is not how you'll make people liking it, by saying it's just player's mentality. You just don't want to hear BfA sucks and it's easily the worst WoW expansion to date. 
---
And I think you remember Legion little bit wrong, yes people were complaining about it's problems. But I don't remember seeing players leaving in huge amounts, I don't remember seeing so few raids being runned in primetime. I don't remember my realm being empty, I don't remember my guild that's been running for years being empty. And most importantly, I don't remember people saying it was the worst expansion. I'm sorry but if you think people will have great memories a few years about BfA you're delusional.
---
Also 2004 pservers? And you were playing them just fine? Because from what I remember the first pservers were beyond unplayable.
---
Nightfall on hunter is a waste, get a off tank to use it instead.
---
Hi. What's your take on shamans ?
---
Very true, I just prefer frost as it allows me to get away lol
---
this was def a thing.
---
Also, I disagree.  Current PVP is significantly more difficult than Vanilla, even in its current state.  Ignoring important CDs usually leads to a loss.  Using defensives inappropriately can easily lead to dying.  
---
People claim you can't outplay someone but that's just flat out wrong.  
---
Things like focus macro chaos bolt/gpy to pop defensives out of someone not being hit, pull spell reflects, etc are all great examples.  Casting fear while simultaneously casting seduce to pull enrage, then stop casting fear while making a warrior still sit the cc, are another great form of outplay.
---
Arena 1-2-3 macro'ing druid caster form leap on Blade's Edge so they're not predicting a leap back up is another great form of outplay that can happen.  
---
Those are just a few things.
---
I think you're suffering from being a 12 year old that can't take an insult LOL
---
It's tough. I want the updated VFX / Models / Animations, which shouldn't be a problem at all, to implent with a simple on/off slider. We had that one already...  
---
Aside from that, yeah, dual spec by a longshot. So many specs for PvP need some adjustments (blackout for priests for example) because they're useless in PvE / Raiding. Paying the hybrid tax with inferior damage, sucking in pvp because you need to squeeze every bit of damage out of the tree / instead of pvp utility stuff, having the highest maintance cost due to necessary consumables and also respeccing frequently to be halfdecent at something. It's just a mix for desaster for every hybrid class.  
---
It also fixes the age old problem off to few healers / tanks and gives more freedom to experiment.
---
The Wowhead team set up the Classic site so you can have it look like Thottbot :)
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=290177/thottbot-visual-theme-now-live-on-classic-wowhead-site
---
We also imported a bunch of old Thottbot and Allakhazam comments too!
---
Everyone gets lost in WC, Sunken Temple, Zul‚ÄôFarrak, and especially BRD. It‚Äôs a rite of passage.
---
No one gets lost in the Razorfens, though; you start out lost and a successful run is when you manage to get unlost.
---
I think Tauren are pretty cool. I would much sooner cut Purple elves, Dwarves, and gnomes. Unfortunately no matter how many times I kill them. They always seem to re-spawn.
---
Looks to me like someone created a thread to simulate the barrens chat lmao

Vael, the killer of guilds.
---
It's such a shame. I've played on ER-US since November 2004 and it used to be a huge, vibrant community. I think it was one of the largest servers at one point. Now it's a ghost town.
---
What polls have you been looking at?  Shamans have been low in every single one I've seen.  Talking in regards to faction stats, you are typically seeing 5% shaman and 10% warrior.  That is a fairly huge difference considering mage is usually second with 8%~. 
---
If you look at the big polls that don't take faction into account, usually warriors are around 18% with shamans down at 5%, barely above pallys dead last at 4%.
---
It‚Äôs even cheaper if you are a Tauren for total cost
---
It isn't about thin skin. More about doing my best to make them look ridiculous.
---
I think "Vanilla" means more than everything predating TBC.
---
I‚Äôll gladly take TBC in 2 years instead.
---
&gt; also vs newbies backpedaling and keyboard turning
---
That's the most bizarre thing when watching those old pvp videos. It's like yeah no wonder everyone thought it was op they all move around like they're using a racing wheel.
---
i still dont get how people have autoattack on the bar.. Especially on 1..
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt remember how mounts worked in classic, the cancelaura stuff was in the post WOTLK macro rework.
---
There is a white leather hood in brd i forgot the name though 
---
Edit: ghostshroud
---
Idk why people are down voting you. Can't chain procs WF or other extra attack procs and it has its ap cut by half. Losing ~360 ap per hit of WF is pretty huge.
---
You are a hero of the internet. Fuck asmongold. I dont not like the guy but 20 accounts for just clips of him reacting to shit is re god damned diculous. I had taken to just reporting all of them for everything it would allow in hopes some of the shitty less connected fanboy accounts get wiped by the youtube bot and one less spam garbage would be in my suggested.

Preach gamings entire Youtube Channel uses the Video as background noise, and is all about the commentary and discussions. I have him running in the background while I'm playing.

---
And this may come as a surprise to you, but I didn't hate on anyone with this post, so pump the brakes, no one crapped on your personal deity. I gave a useful hint on the usage of the Youtube Search Engine, which btw. is applicable to every search parameter, and may benefit people looking for specific things that have nothing to do with wow or streaming.
---
If you want to be aggressive towards me because I try to help people improve their user experience in a search interface, then please waste someone elses time.
---
Fair enough, but it is still the case that for a pretty long period of time, frost is pretty much required as a mage.
---
female.
---
Agreed. Even back in TBC, I wished abilities did different things in Arena in order for that to be balanced while leaving PVE alone.
---
Farm Strat UD and get really lucky ?
---
Or as the others have said lots of cloth turnin's or hope you just eek it out at the start by leveling via their quests and making a leveling route focused on max rep efficiency.
---
If they dont fix WF until the game goes live, nobody needs to worry about enhancer ever.
---
Edit:
---
Was reported already tho, so Im optimistic that were going back to lucky onehits (or 4hits + shock actually) :D
---
That may have just been your server. Because mine was nothing like that. Hunters and Rogues were the cock roaches on mine.
---
Ok assuming that 57% horde number is correct... 8 percent divided by .57... still high at 14%.
---
For sure. There's tons of knowledge that will be there from the start. 
---
But doesn't mean that you have to play that way. Play however you want to play, I say
---
Yeah, it's nice when RPGs have roleplaying elements
---
They seem very effective in small battles before they oom. So having spirit tap would be great tryna land killing blows and move from target to target
---
its still entirely possible to have 19hr games with 1.12 av. no reinforcements yet.
---
Sameness buddy, great times with that :).
---
Because for the first half of the video storm strike didn't exist.
---
I want to get into the 55-60 range and start recruiting people for my guild.
---
I'm not at my desktop anymore, I'll add builds later.
---
But basically with aoe, you strictly dont take frostbite but improved blizzard.
---
It'd the other way around with ST. There are a few more minor differences, but those are basically the core
---
Frostbite is actually bad for the AoE build, since it has a good chance of ruining the pack of mobs you are kiting.
---
No the only advice my mom gave me was, "Watch out when your walking home from school, your every child molesters dream. The boy the dosnt grow."
---
You make many valid points here! Thanks for the quality reply. I'm guilty of having dual spec on my wishlist, however I'd love to see it have a 7 day cooldown. I think it'd be convenient to have it, but it should reset weekly with raids.
---
Hunters get trash talked because of the playerbase that play hunters lol. From what I know, it's been that way since OG Classic.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree. Just saying it‚Äôs a bit more inflated because it‚Äôs on the popular faction.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nth4RqqmQZ4
---
Is that a grunt shaman with top KBs wow
---
Starts 1.6 or 1.7 ish , then goes into 1.10 where storm strike becomes a thing, but before the WF ap nerf 1.11
---
They still could fill in with the old data until we have updates.
---
I‚Äôm doing one up from this, my vanilla experience is going to be dual boxing warrior shaman just to feed myself windfury totem and heal bot.
---
Me, in a folder disguised as Internet Explorer. Tech savvy people don't click that, non techies won't get near my pc. Win.
---
So what you are saying is, next time I want to search for a Preach video, I should type "PreachGaming -asmongold" makes sense.
---
Hunters by far... Get 30% speed boost with aspect of the cheeta and beast tracking to make mobs show up on mini map
---
&gt; Play however you want to play, I say
---
Obviously, that goes without saying.
---
I like the THICC ladies, but not so much their animations. I actually *really* like male Dwarf heal.
---
I literally came here to say how good it is.
---
^yes. but also keep skin color and face changes off for obvious reasons.

Back in the day people would just live off their lives, if you repeat the same thing today you will probably die.

---
Isn‚Äôt the title you get after killing maloriak (Sp) in black rock descent technically a buff or debuff? I can‚Äôt remember. But ‚Äúslayer of stupid, incompetent, and disappointing minions‚Äù is one of my favorites as well
---
An arms warriors is going to rape all of those apart from a frost mage.  If a shaman gets the jump on you with frost shock spam, then they might have a good chance, but if warriors get that charge off, they are screwed.  
---
Hunters are similar.  If they caught a warrior off guard, then they get the win, but if a warriors gets that out of combat charge off before the shot reaches them, then the hunter is just going to be screwed unless that hamstring misses.
---
Retail's current mob tagging system. One person per mob always makes me anxious when I'm trying to just relax and quest and then all of a sudden somebody else shows up and now I'm constantly thinking about how I have to urgently get to the mobs I need or else I'm going to be waiting for a respawn timer. Then again, it's also nice having a reason to talk to those around me to group up, but then there's also the problem of being told to piss off and it's back to the headache inducing race. This could just be a me problem since I'm socially awkward anyway.
---
You're correct I have no way of knowing that. I suspect it will never be implemented anyway so I guess it doesn't matter. However, the need for a guild bank still exists. The work around nets blizzard with an extra sub fee (which actually results in breaking ToS with account sharing). 
---
A guild bank with limited functions that acts as just another few bank tabs (similar to how an alt works) that can be accessed by specific guild ranks would... in essence...be like having a separate account.
---
I see, I didn't really know what you were saying because you just posted a link and didn't write anything. Especially considering your previous comment was saying that the linked poll didn't show many shaman, and 14% puts it at the most played class.
---
You forgot your full-set Defias gear
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Silver linings right?
---
Maybe but not In classic
---
Red is dead baby. Red is dead.

Okay bye, I am done with you.

Officers are supposed to be the leaders of the guild. If the two members missing was going to make it not worth raiding then that needed to be decided in advance. Calling a raid after an hour because you ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt like how people were acting‚Äù falls on you as an officer and leader.  Depending on what expansion you wasted at least 20 people‚Äôs Tuesday night by not being able to competently lead a raid or make a decision before hand to cancel the raid. You probably won‚Äôt get this because like every other person you believe your the right person to be an officer in every guild your in because it‚Äôs a status symbol.
---
Lol at faerie fire being useless.
---
They didn't even do any analysis and just concluded that you aren't even going to get 38 hits every 3 seconds.  How can you say that's less cursory than my math?  You don't need 5 hunter pets to make it viable but the 15 attacks per 3 seconds their pet would provide gets you pretty fucking close to that 38 hits per 3 seconds she cites.  It's not a "unique circumstance" to have enough melee to where arthas gives more than 100 DPS...
---
You use curse of weakness while your tankis undergeared, and curse of recklessness otherwise.  Pretty obvious why the / is there I thought.
---
Nightfall procs are negligible.  You get a 4% chance every 3 seconds to reduce the cast time of shadow bolt by 1 second (from 2.5 to 1.5).  Demonic Sacrifice is more dps than SM even if you add in Nightfall.  You expect less than 1 proc per minute, and each proc is basically 65% increased cast speed of your next SB.  That's not an appreciable dps increase unless you have 4 or 5 corruptions out.
---
Its only really hot for maybe a month here in Germany where i live so the costs to install and run AC is not worth it (electricity is also more expensive compared to the US like 3x as much). 
---
Most summer days its "only" around 25¬∞C - 30¬∞C (77¬∞F - 86¬∞F) but usually there are a few weeks with where we have up to 36¬∞C (97¬∞C) and if you're not used to those kind of temperatures it sucks.

This video made me want to roll enhance shammy. But then I actually thought about it and the frustration of how RNG this is just turned me away from it lol.
---
Its what makes vanilla great FOR YOU
---
I do see that, but in order for you to use a guild bank you'd have to be in a guild which would require some level of social interaction to begin with. Managing a guild bank using an alt or another account is a very tedious process.
---
AIE was fairly small until some point in BC.
---
I like having Taurens in my group. There aren't enough.
---
That said, I cant play a cow. The aesthetic doesnt work for me. Troll and orc ladies for life
---
In vanilla, you just go raw damage as a warrior for PvP.  Being able to charge someone and have a good chance at a double crit (auto attack into MS) can 2 shot most people in the game.  If you don't get a crit, then there is actually a fight to speak of.
---
Not all boars have livers.
---
Not all murlocs have eyes.
---
However, Vancleef has 5 heads.
---
its just a gimmick
---
Downvoted, not related to classic in any way, also low effort clickbait.
---
Fair point, but - more supply, more demand, so idk :)
---
Allow you to choose to xfer a Classic Vanilla character over to the new Classic TBC servers, if you so decide.
---
Imo, make it a REAL decision. Not a character copy to a tbc server, but a transfer. If you move your main over, there‚Äôs no takesy backsies. They are now a tbc character.
---
But any characters you don‚Äôt move will remain completely unaffected. No pre-patch shenanigans, nothing. It remains on patch 1.12 (I think classic will officially be 1.13 though?)
---
Sorry, I'm not "tech savvy" enough to understand the post.
---
Yeah, I'd love to see it barebones. Like, just a few extra tabs like you'd have on an alt anyway. Nothing extravagant.
---
As an enhance that was frost shock specced I have to disagree
---
Right, I don't think 50g is reasonable. Or at least, with slow decay rates. Could just as easily decay the price quicker so that you can respec every 2 weeks without breaking the bank.
---
I'll be playing a hybrid that won't require respecs very much so it doesn't really affect me, but it's a big problem for warriors, for example. It sucks that a prot warrior can't really choose to PvP without giving up tanking - while the mage can pick multiple specs that work well in both. Flawed.
---
Modified Power Auras Classic will work if you're talking about Vanilla servers. For Classic, you'll have to wait until someone updates AddOns - I'm pretty sure WeakAuras is being worked on but have no idea if it's usable yet.
---
Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom
---
Hand of Justice
---
I am sure with one proc somethings going to hit the floor.
---
Yeah cause twinking wasn't super popular...
---
You can use WeakAuras to track it. DruidFocus if you can find a version for classic
---
There is an unreal engine render of [Elywnn Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlNAJJtCfpI), looks pretty dope, still prefer the cartoon-ish style of WoW though.
---
Also, [Duskwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5elh0aaIIz0) and [Durotar](https://youtu.be/VRzKUR628aU?t=6) if people wanted to see more.
---
In regards to 7.
---
If you start your own group, then you can still find a tank.  I never remember having issues getting other warriors to join me despite knowing that we would be competing on the same gear.  
---
People were always so desperate to get into 5 mans back then.  Might turn out to be different, but I guess we will see.
---
But you could just click the buff off with no GCD. I mean I'm not arguing as I clearly don't remember myself, but it seems illogical to restrict you from casting a spell after dismounting in a macro
---
I didn‚Äôt math the original poll. But when he assumed half of each class will be on each faction, i remembered blizzard polled it ok facebook and horde had the higher numbers.
---
&gt;Emote!! /love, /hug, /wave are all great ways to try and stop a fight.
---
Let me put it this way: I have hugged, loved and waved many a corpse back in the day.
---
I had to do this when I played some warrior on a p wrath server not too long ago. Had to find a perfect balance between rage generation and threat generation. Doing one full tree didn't supply enough of either.
---
I hear Ele was super bursty? Or am i mistaken?
---
Achievements
---
Roll another class then
---
Oh I remover lime wire well lol rip my dad‚Äôs computer...
---
emotional bitch.
---
Twinking was absolutely super popular, without a doubt.
---
So were Teletubbies.
---
Guess what they both have in common? You guessed it.
---
Well I wasn't shitting on him personally anyways, just on the way 'his' videos are presented
---
Like all of those things don't apply to the 2h fury warrior what, it's more random however and has much more intense resource management
---
Do you even overpower bruh
---
And no it's called experience based on full t3 hunter roommate and myself playing 2h fury at the highest level and comparing notes
---
Groveling does work sometimes if there is no incentive to kill you
---
It's difficult to justify killing some one when they're sitting there just spamming emotes at you. Sucks all the fun outta it
---
Asmon does have the ability to get all those videos removed with a single mouse click though, Youtube has a copyright system built specifically for this. 
---
Not necessarily saying he *should*, just that he could.
---
same. this is literally the only thing i want.
---
^blizzard ^^pls.
---
&gt; It's probably just going to be abused.
---
Just like... :p
---
healers are always in biggest demand, but mage is not bad, i'd say somewhere in the middle.
---
There's always drugs for that
---
It's not like he used much spells in combat.
---
Warriors are frickin everywhere.
---
Private servers for practice
---
It's even funnier because almost everything people are getting angry over has actually been shown to be consistent with Vanilla. This is one of the very few exceptions.
---
Guess he won't be alone then :)
---
Are you sure you know what the term "dual-boxing" means?
---
Red = Dead
---
I kill everybody regardless of lvl. Best part of the game is denying other people from enjoying it.
---
Yo that's my boi Senn! We used to have epic WPvP battles. I would win sometimes and then he would win. Damn I can't believe I remember that
---
No one has time to fuck around in a video game? A video game with content _released 15 years ago_? A video game that by all measures, is solved, practiced, and trained to death? Damn dude.
---
Vanilla had lots of flaws.
---
In a general sense, I sympathize with the point of view that any given system can always be made better, and that nothing is ever perfect. But in this specific case, I have to agree with the OP.
---
The reason retail is the way it is can be seen very clearly in this thread.
---
The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Lots of the suggestions in this thread seem like good changes that would positively affect QoL. But the problem is where do you draw the line? How many of the changes do you make? If you start changing small things, pretty soon some people will just ask for the next, slight bigger QoL improvement. For a while this might seem fine, but next thing you know you've just remade Cata, and blown the whole thing to hell.
---
The "slippery slope" argument is often made fun of in this community these days, but there's a reason the argument is made so much: *It's a good argument*. Nobody knows for sure which "small QoL" change was the straw that broke the camels back. Nobody knows exactly where the magic of the game was lost. A lot of the magic from Vanilla happened *directly because things were hard and there was low QoL*. So much of Vanilla's brilliance came from emergent and social gameplay, and almost all of that aspect of the game is completely gone from retail. **Trying to fix the flaws of vanilla wow, as you put it, is for better or worse the direct cause of why so many people hate retail**.
---
There must exist a perfect hypothetical version of vanilla where only the right changes are made, but I don't trust any actual human being to make those changes without ruining the game as a whole.
---
I'm not trying to be memey or smarmy here, but honestly, the people who want all these QoL changes, maybe vanilla just isn't for you. That's OK. There's nothing wrong with those people for wanting the things they want. But they just don't want this game. Don't take this game away from all the other people who have been asking for it back for 15 years.
---
Yea, people who plan on raiding 4-5 days a week will be able to reach that insane power spike, but the vast majority of players are going to be disappointed, considering most simply don't hard core raid.  
---
MC/BWL gear isn't enough to consistently top charts on every fight compared to rogue and mages.
---
If you want proportional armor your only options are like male Human and male BElf. Everyone else has something wrong about their proportions or shape of certain items (looking at you, Tauren and Worgen helms)
---
You're in the wrong place if you're looking for empathy on a PvP server. PvE server is where it is at.
---
Where is the video link??
---
No need to be guilty of it, it‚Äôs a thing that‚Äôs been in since what, 2008/9? It‚Äôs not exactly a new feature, but I do think it‚Äôs something that has deteriorated the community. A 7 day Cooldown does sound like a good idea if they were to implement it, but I wouldn‚Äôt know the full extent of that.
---
I mean it is though. That's something that took a while to understand but for everything you don't like, there are a million people in a different age bracket than you who do. 
---
People constantly say "what happened to old TV network X why is it so bad now" and it's the same concept.
---
All the kiddies will eat up whatever grabs their attention first.
---
The diplomatic option? You mean eyeballing the shit out of each other for suspicious activity? Then as soon as they look at you funny, you both go ham af on each other regardless of the previous unspoken truce?
---
Or you two have a truce, everything is peachy... until a rogue pounces on you. Then when you defend yourself, they see you attacking their ally, so they jump on you too?
---
Nah, babe. Don‚Äôt even open yourself to such betrayal. Red is dead.
---
It's not as easy as it seems, we don't have robust vanilla data on-hand to simply insert the old data in. We've been working on some manual updates but it's a bit time-consuming. We'll likely have some update soon though if dungeon uploads continue to be sparse.
---
As an example of how the client does updates, on Friday this page was empty and today it has 7 drops: https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=645/cookie
---
Or continuing to make posts about things that blizzard has already confirmed as not a bug, which is also a problem on this sub.
---
I never said he'd be alone, I said he'd be without friends.
---
I'm dumb and mean but I select my words carefully.
---
TIL you can get away with being douchey if you just say you're doing it on purpose.
---
**Actual players in vanilla:** let's do an all-druid onyxia because we can
---
You know the guy? Legend
---
You forgot Ele Sham. They are beasts in 1v1 bgs and world PvP as well as those 3.
---
Yeah, we prefer N64 graphics.
---
I don't know man. I almost never used cooking / potion buffs while leveling in vanilla. They may help you leveling faster, but I wouldn't say you absolutely must use it.
---
later, sorry bro i bring great dishonor to my family
---
That's of course fine too! its more the people who seemingly are married/dating someone who actively hates what they do, and that they have to ask permission to play games at all that boggles my mind
---
Turn the second box off and make some friends in-game to play with.
---
Honestly I hate the fans more than him. It‚Äôs insanity we need an internet purge
---
Didn't wowhead grab the old thottbot database back in the day?
---
I am aware that this is old, but it can't be too hard to flag the records, and replace them as soon as current data becomes available, no?
---
Pretty sure it works, but people very rarely spec it. BG's aren't attrition battles where you want to be efficient and need mana regen. You blow all your mana in fights and then drink when the fight is over.
---
I will try before raid, thanks
---
&gt;Balance is them all being equal  
---
False. There are many ways to balance games, rock&gt;scissors etc. being one of them  
---
Most notorious example of this would be Dota.  
---
And again, rock&gt;scissors is mainly a PVP thing.  
---
PvE vanilla has almost no balance. You could argue some classes are balanced to have damage and some utility. But then you get warlocks that have unique utility as well as top damage. So that argument falls flat.  
---
&gt;While PvE is the core due to leveling, there were no PvE servers planned at launch. PVP is core to the game as well. Even PvE servers can flag and do BG's.  
---
No, its PVE because leveling/questing is PVE, dungeons are PVE, raids are PVE.   
---
PVP side of the game doesn't even have tenth of the content PVE has and had nothing at start of the game. Server type is irrelevant.  
---
PVP is a "mini game" that you get to do sometimes but can entirely skip essentially. Most of the game revolves around PVE. 
---
&gt;The BG portal thing is entirely moot as there are Battlemasters  
---
They are basically the same thing. Instead of going to portal you go to masters. Except you don't even have to do that, just have one of your party members there, which defeats the whole purpose of making you go to masters to Q for PVP.
---
That argument doesn't really work because it's actually, wow we completed that raid now let's do it again every week for a few months to gear up so we can do the next one. 
---
I'm fact with the phases for classic it's arguably worse than retail for raiding because you'll do the exact same content (no difficulty options) for a few months with no option to progress because there's no where to go until the next phase(patch).  At least in retail there's extra difficulties to do.
---
N.b. I'm not pro retail at all I just think it's a ridiculous argument.
---
I will try before raids. Thank you
---
I'll have to trust you on that, never did real high end pvp in vanilla
---
Hugs and kisses are for rp servers.
---
Holy shit my PC did in fact look almost like that. No black parts, all sillver/blue....with a spider-man emblem in the front.
---
Do we know what time on the 27th the servers are going to go live?  Considering taking the 27-30th off work but no point in the 27th if the servers aren't live until later.
---
The issue would be what talents are you giving up for Spirit Tap? Most of the talents taken are quite impactful on their effectiveness in pvp. Spirit Tap would be nice (and procs in pvp if you get the KB), but I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôd sac for it.
---
Priest.
---
Just like a bug. Definitely not spell batching. That's for sure. No way to abuse that. No sir. 
---
Anyway this isn't as functional as spellbatching. It just looks like bad lag and will turn people off. Unlike...
---
Then how does gear progress?  Kind of defeats the purpose of an MMO where progression is paramount, but yeah that would be nice.
---
It is a little bit related to Classic, because this is a tribute to Nogg-Aholic the movie... You don't know about this vanilla movie ? :D
---
fuckin' *yawn* 
---
you are whining. I went back to "scroll down" as you say and your comment thread was at the bottom of this post. know why? because you're complaining to hear yourself talk. of course you will need to pay a penalty to constantly respec. of course you won't be able to maximize your score with everything. so what are you going to sacrifice? that's the choice you have to make. pick something to sacrifice. if you don't want to sacrifice anything, play retail.
---
Does he actually use a chair like that? It looks super comfy.
---
I won warden staff in ZF on my shaman back in vanilla... and equipped it... yikes
---
Again i didn't explain fully as i only use reddit on my phone and we are sharing light hearted stories 
---
Your fault is making too many assumptions. This was heroic progression on nighthold and i often would fill  in as raid lead. This particular night was our first raid day we got to guldan within 3 hours and wiped on him 12 times for stupid mistakes. The raid had also started late by 30 minutes. People wanted to keep going as they assumed we raid for 4 hours. It was made clear we raid until 11pm as most people get off at that time. They thought we should go till 1130 since they were late. I called ot at 1050 as the officers decided also many of our top end players were frustrated with our bottom end whom seemed to enjoy wiping. We also had a whole other 2 raid days to do guldan and helya. Not once during guldan did we get him under 30% and our last wipe he was at 85%. We clearly needed our raid lead whom was our top dps 
---
As main tank my role as officer was not to decide punishments etc. Get off my ass
---
Yeah I got yelled at for soulstoning myself in SM on a private server. I was kinda peeved cause I figured ahnk. Later he explained himself and it made sense. He was nice about it later
---
There are 2 better 2handers that drop from rag himself than hand of rag for warriors, so yeah generally shamans and ret's take it.
---
That sucks
---
&gt;	It‚Äôs difficult to justify killing some one when they‚Äôre sitting there just spamming emotes at you. 
---
False. If they are red and I have time, I will kill them. I will emote hug and kiss their corpse back.
---
*Begins to think of the possible origin of a race of humanoid cows...*
---
You know what, nevermind.
---
Also, Robo is that you. I got money it is.
---
Are you talking about private servers or pre-patch 1.12 "retail"? Just want to make sure.
---
Yeah it's wonked
---
Wtf are you smoking? Getting the urge to grab inappropriate fps sure but c'mon now
---
You just have a premade carry you. 
---
It's no big deal, the entire group has raid gear and basic coordination which trumps randoms.
---
Long as you paid a Chinese farmer to play while you slept it didn't really matter how good you were.
---
Sure, you tended to be better than most, but that's not saying much. There were plenty of rank 5-13's that were much better than some who got r14.
---
Make taurens and gnomes skinnable.
---
yeah i agree it's not worth getting in a tizzy over. only issue is it is only 5 ankhs per stack and the cd is pretty long on reincarnation.
---
Shamans don‚Äôt get ankh until 30 afaik, soul stone is 18
---
By that logic I could post a BfA video and say it's related, because it's also World of Warcraft.
---
A Tribute to some vanilly movie != Classic Content, unless it SHOWS classic content, end of discussion.
---
Mages will be pretty easy to come by, but yes you will need usually 2 in every premade. Usually defending will be your job if frost, as you and hunter can sit on the banana ramp up and slow pushes towards your FC. Offensive are somtimes elemental or arcane fire. Warlocks are high demand due to lack of players if thats your thing, but you only need 1 in every group. However, if you wanna be a swole link 1v1 king, premades won't have any need for you. Priests are the only healers on horde side, so they're in high demand. You usually run one offense and one defense priest. On alliance, paladins are your offense healers and priests are your defense healers, especially because they can dispel free action pots etc on other teams offense.
---
Wrong sub yea
---
Limewire PRO
---
Sounds like redemption to me
---
I think the mounts were bow very early on in vanilla. But I believe they were made boo long before the patch we‚Äôre going to be based.
---
windows 7 still works just fine
---
Put ~2k hours into Total War: Warhammer 2 , would highly recommend. Even has some good lore - skaven yes yes. 
---
Zerkovich on youtube has some beginner guides that help newer players out that feel lost on their first campaign.
---
I would gladly trade you taurens for gnomes bro
---
Dark Age of Camelot?
---
Frost
---
It works on most pservers. Can't confirm classic. But, the points are definitely not worth it, no matter what spec you go.
---
Is this the Destromath Guild? I remember killing and being killed by members of this guild leveling up way back in Vanilla and TBC. Great guild.
---
Look up Pat pvp video. Thats a r14 warrior who had one more talent points than everyone else.
---
No one expects portals for free though
---
Calm down my friend, breath :D
---
I thought what is best is life is a the open steppe.  A fleet horse.  A falcon on your wrist. And the wind in the hair !!
---
Well, PVE servers are the diplomatic option. If you're are on a PVP server, don't whine when someone ganks you while you're questing. Is it frustrating? Of course. But so is wiping in a raid. Get angry at the character, not the player behind the keyboard.
---
can anybody join or just for invited people?
---
Such good times on ER PvPing horde side back then. My only problem was trying to choose between playing my hunter Shinhadouken or my druid Habanero.
---
Also, Longarms was such a joke. He was the easiest kill in the BG other than a clothie wearing blues. He didn't understand anything about hunter burst or sustained damage and was always spending mana to cast serpent sting or scorpid sting on you.
---
Shamans work with the elements of Earth, Fire, Wind and Water.
---
Snake is not an element.
---
Is that monitor stand a nes? Wow.
---
That's us! Thanks for the shout. Feel free to come hang on Discord :)
---
Then dont die as Shaman 4Head
---
The archives weren't configured that way - even importing the comments was a very time-consuming process, more complex than we expected because of some issues with the backup information.
---
We'll probably have something to show soon for the higher-level dungeons as it seems the earlier ones are in decent shape with the Client, after only a few days of public use.
---
Hi, /u/ComatoseJoy
---
And how does that make any sense, you are implying because he is twinking he won't have any friends, but then saying it's really popular and he won't be alone, hmmm
---
Redemption
---
Your description of hunter dps in your post didn't even mention melee you probably didn't even know it was a thing so your comparing notes with your "t3 hunter room mate" likely has 0 relevance. There's also lots of other nuisances for hunters. Depending on the skill level and # of hunters in the raid it changes what tier set you choose to use. T2's set bonus applies to all hunters hitting the boss out performing T3 in alot of cases. But putting your best hunters in T3 and using your unskilled hunters as support w/ the tier bonus is also an option if your hunters aren't all equal.
---
I don't know from just reading what you write I get the feeling you have little idea of what you're speaking about.
---
I plan on finding where a Rogue is griefing (popular spot is like the entrance to Redridge), sitting in stealth as kitty. When the Rogue kills the level 18 entering the zone, I will simply Faerie Fire him and run away and do this over and over again. 
---
At least from what I've seen, the rogues that come here aren't usually ?? from this area's range.
---
Anyone have any ideas for a hybrid fury and arms warrior, who can pve and pvp?

But they don't mean the same. Mbps = Mega bit per second

Amazing!
---
Permafrost would be the talent that you'd drop if you want to pick up Improved CoC. I just don't really think it's worth it. Permafrost makes your life a lot easier, especially because you don't have Ice Barrier to work with.
---
Furthermore, if you want a strong 1vX burst then going FN &gt; Blast Wave will do just as much damage and still apply a slow as well. Granted, it can be a bit harder to position for it correctly, and being able to double up and do BW + Imp CoC is pretty nuts. But I'm personally just not one to prioritise talents for group fights, as I believe group fights are generally going to be won on other aspects than a bit more damage on an AoE skill (like interrupts, CC, position and targeting, Permafrost actually does help in those areas as well).
---
Oh how I envy you...to go through that first playthrough again...
---
Fun, unrelated, disturbing story:
---
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) can be genetically traced back to an origin in the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), a sickness in Monkeys.
---
I leave it to the dark recesses of your fantasy to figure out how that happened ;-)
---
I mean, yes. Because it is essentially new content, especially to most players. If they had been playing this for over 12 months daily, like retail, they would be just as bored...
---
Hillsbrad Foothills is a such a different place on a PvE server. If you have already done Vanilla on a PvP server then I strongly recommend going PvE this time around. There is so much to every zone that goes unnoticed when your attention is focused on not getting ganked.
---
I can hear this picture.
---
I‚Äôm on my late 20s and that‚Äôs the one thing I just can‚Äôt get my mind around in gaming culture now. The twitch/YouTuber/content creator worship and drama is out of control. I want to be nowhere near anyone or anything streaming related when I play video games, hopefully I can avoid a server on classic that has any notable ones on them.
---
I am talking about Vanilla "Retail". I never played on any private servers.
---
only invited.  some subscribed people are getting invites, but probably a lot of subscribers never get one
---
Seems par for the course
---
What part confuses you? People gravitate towards "twink" characters because they yearn for the chance to excel in an uneven playing field. These kinds of people aren't typically Chads, and there is certainly no shortage of them.
---
Thanks a lot. I'll take it into consideration!
---
Could you pm which server? Thanks!
---
You mean you don't want to play a cow that turns into a bear? 
---
(Seriously I never understood half-animal races turning into different animals.)
---
Me too. Only thing I hated is retraining weapon skill after every respec. Not only did I need to spend gold but flail around as well.
---
[You heard correctly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE_KzAEBIVc)
---
I played vanilla from launch. I was in one of the top guilds and we were the first who cleared Naxx on our realm. I was also R14 and one of the best PvPers on the server.
---
i'm 27.
---
those parents were complaining about cartoons....that is a totally different physical medium that parents do not like. IF we as children were watching a show where a stuffed animal reviewed what happened on last nights episode of game of thrones THEN we would be at an analogy.
---
He was a good guy, I remember once I was talking to him and I said "How can you stand just shooting green things all day long?"  
---
He replied: "I'd rather grind people than mobs."
---
yes, damage is correct. that video is very dishonest. he's just directly comparing damage based on levels and not the mob itself.
---
Rhahk'zor, the level 19 elite, swings VERY slow, so, he does a lot of damage per swing. every other mob he compared hit much faster, so, they do less damage per hit. he's not taking attack speed into account at all, so, he's just directly comparing damage and wondering why mobs that hit faster aren't hitting as hard as a slow, boss elite swinging a big two-handed mace.
---
The same reason Athene got popular, the obnoxious attitude is part of the act and his viewers are in on the jokes. When he's serious about something you will instantly see his body language, tone of voice and demeanor change.
---
Example is when he made the video guide of how to be elitist (one of the videos that made him popular years back), he was taking on all the stereotypes and observations and pushing them to the extreme as a form of satirical comedy. Of course not everybody gets it, just like not everybody "got" Athene back in the TBC/WOTLK days.
---
I think Asmongold talks a lot of sense when he's being genuine, but his audience is to be avoided, though his worst "haters" are just as bad as his worst audience, I hate seeing posts about him all over the internet with people who dislike him spamming all ways to try to get him banned/silenced, I wouldn't have to see his name/face half as much if the haters grew up and got on with their lives instead of dedicating it to him.
---
"QOL" and "new content" is what got us into this mess. You need to be way more specific for your argument to hold any water.
---
I think it must've been a server thing. We always called Deadmines DM. After Dire Maul came out it was always abbreviated DME, DMW or DMN to specify which wing you were running. It also helps that no level 20 should be looking for a Tribute Run and no level 60 needs a group for Deadmines.
---
Imagine getting really angry over what abbreviation people use for a level 15 WoW dungeon, that would be silly, wouldn't it?
---
I‚Äôve played around with the talent calculator a decent amount and it seems like I would be giving up 5 points in discipline for it. Either being 5/5 mental agility, or 3/5 mental agility and 2 in mana burn
---
Whats wrong with being a douche?
---
u/theantiop remember when u got turned into a cow on Nef?
---
none because i quit during wrath so i havn't experienced any of what the current WoW is.  I'm comign back because it's classic
---
Finally got around to playing Alien Isolation friday night, decided to smoke a joint before-hand - not my best idea.
---
Engineering is fine, but honestly, unless you are in a Hardcore raiding guild or are super into PVP, it's not really necessary. 
---
There is next to no gold to be made from Engineering.
---
I was the priest that MCd him and promptly sat down for that 1 shot.

Transmog
---
Yeah but how will he get to ‚Äútop levels of gear‚Äù when it‚Äôs shit in the beginning
---
The reason I say he's a leader isn't that I think he's a good one. It's because he takes his "kids" on adventures and organizes stuff for them to do. Keep in mind your camp councilor is a leader of sorts. Just a leader of kids. Asmogold is the wow equivalent of a camp councilor.
---
no I didn't jerk off till I was like 17 so idk what that was
---
Hmm do cooldowns reset on death? Is is possible to get the hunter killed and battleres him to use one tranq
---
I would definitely recommend taking a point out of frost channeling and into Shatter.  10% more crit on frozen is way better than 5% mana

---
I don't really know wtf people like you mean when they say "at top levels of play". Playing an enhance shaman isn't exactly rocket science, the difference between a braindead monkey and a rank 1 glad is probably the closest in terms of class skill gaps in vanilla when playing enh shaman.
---
Plain and simple classes that don't suck will do twice as much damage as an enhance shaman. The 1.12 enhancements purpose in life is to be a buff bitch, which can easily be achieved by useful specs like resto and eventually ele.
---
I still believe people should play what they want, but this retarded retail mindset that anything can be good as as long as it's played well needs to be dispelled.
---
I actually never got one, yar har
---
I'm giving you one last chance okay?
---
I can do fine with the 50g respec. It's not a big deal, but I think the game is healthier with 25g respec. And yes I can get everything I want in the game with no sacrifices. 
---
Leveling a 2nd rogue to save 100g a week is pointless.
---
And I get the feeling you're nothing but a bang average warrior *shrugs*
---
As I said , melee weaving or not - it's the same fucking concept like how hard is that to grasp?
---
Once you learn the rotation in relation to your weapon you just spam that shit over and over with little variation 
---
And your point about t2 hunters is so irrelevant to the point we're discussing in regards to rotsrion. The full t3 part is to show you know, implied veterancy of the class 
---
Your hollow arguments are so void of critical thinking it's hilarious really
---
Walk away, twink. I'm sorry to have offended you.
---
Just kidding, I'm not.
---
The Tauren are wary of their Horde brethren. There are quests offered by Taurens that are not obtainable by Forsaken players for Lore reasons due to this lack of trust. Tauren have no place in the Horde if they cannot trust their compatriots.
---
I do not grovel.
---
I would give druids a rez and paladins a taunt - no other changes.
---
I suspect you need to grow up.
---
Idk I dont agree. The key difference is multiple raids per tier as opposed to one raid per tier with multiple difficulties. Having multiple raids gives you a sense of progression because you get a new setting, new bosses. MMOs will always have repetitive aspects, that's just the nature of the genre. But it sucks to finish normal than rl says "10 min break then we do heroic" and you re enter the same instance and fight the same exact bosses with maybe one mechanic difference. 
---
You're wrong in saying "no option to progress" because the progression is from the first raid in a tier to the second to the third. Hence Kara to gruul to mag. You had to gear in Kara before gruuls, even though it was the same tier. Did you play classic or tbc? Its night and day in terms of progression and immersion. 
---
Idk seems like a difference of subjective opinions so whatever lol. As someone who's played both, I prefer the old style but to each his own.
---
No offense but I smashed that downvote button so hard

Lolol, I had a shield. #shamanlife
---
Group made it to the dungeon. Tank said "noobs" and hearthed out. Awkward silence. "Hey, you can tank shaman." Wut? "Yeah you have a shield, just use rock biter."
---
We proceeded to clear sunken Temple in it's entirety for the next 2 hours. They kept calling me back to tank as a shaman. Best crash course ever and I've tanked on some toon ever since then.

It's an absolute horrible choice IMO. But are you planning to go shadow or healing? Disc or holy its a 100% no go, shadow is a low low maybe if it were up to me. I can't see me ever using it, especially not in BGs
---
Mm... I'm personally hoping that Classic takes a page from OSRS rather than just repeat itself. Repeating itself will either remove "Classic" as it goes on or split the servers with each expansion until it finally starts repeating its' mistakes.
---
Yes, most PvP players are closed minded.

Vanilla ‚Äî&gt; TBC ‚Äî&gt; WotLK

So you expect them to pay someone to go back and effectively break parts of the game because people liked doing that?
---
It was a bug in vanilla, it wasn't a feature. People commonly abusing it doesn't change that fact.
---
Hunter gonna rinse.
---
They were not hard to play at all in PvE.  The 'hard' part was more of a tedious nature than anything else; needing to make sure you always have ammo, pet happiness, and overall self control.  
---
I do agree that almost everyone sucked at them back then though.. also tended to be the ninja looters of a group.
---
Everybody knows that it is a "character". The insult comic is not a new thing, it just requires the person to be extremely witty and able to take it when the same type of joke is thrown at them. Asmongold just gets butthurt and can't come up with funny comebacks.

The things we do waiting for Classic.

Or building a twink is a fun challenge that rewards you for the effort you put in. I don't see how maximizing your gear in a bracket that you generally enjoy is something that would cause so much grief.

Besides this character will probably just wPVP in Ashenvale and keep my faction safe, but you go on bashing people for shit you don't like.

Because re-implementing something which was a bug would be a bit weird.

I'm rolling holy pally with engineering and mining PvP heals for days....or a priest or  shaman or a druid /sigh still don't know what I'm playing but since I've always been horde I might swap to alliance since this will likely go into TBC and I never played Ally's in classic or tbc

I'm torn. When he's being obnoxious it's because he's usually playing to twitch chat, which is pure cancer. But in some clips I've seen where he's being serious, he seems like a very measured, chill person.

started on bonechewer at  release. my ign back then was Lalana.

Friend who got me to play , xiaomei, was a vis maior raider. i can't remember for sure but i believe vis maior was a transfer. my friend xiao who got me to play, joined them when they xferred. Miss the amazonians though, their leader was super friendly.
---
be thankful you don't have a beta invite so you aren't burned out over the next 3 months and you can actually enjoy the game when it releases. I wouldnt want a beta invite if I even got offered one. I didnt even change my beta settings. Unless you actually want to do testing, theres no reason to join the beta.
---
Target faces? What are you talking about man?

Memes are fun, but straight out lies not so much. Download malwarebytes and scan your system.

Plus you can get the Baron mount a lot easier than you can get the ZG mount.

The main advantage of modern youtube is being able to upload videos in much higher quality and being able to speed up video in the video player. Otherwise i think old youtube was better.
---
Fuck yes, I use to sharpen my stone endlessly back in vanilla...
---
It is possible for all alliance races (humans have it easier obv) to hit exalted with darnassus from quests alone. That‚Äôs the only one I know but I‚Äôm 100% certain
---
Hunter would be my choice 100% over Priest. Spriests aren't invited to any premades ever and all their damage is dispellable aside from mind blast. They're not nearly as effective now as they were in 2005. Hunters on the other hand, as player skill has increased they've only gotten better.
---
Key word "eventually". Again, gear acquisition is 5 times slower for vanilla raids than it was in TBC and 10 times slower than wotlk.  Most casual players did not even get half of T1 by the time T2 came out.
---
My server had a server wide custom dkp system. Most people's gear dkp transactions were recorded publically online for everyone to see. It became an issue with people not using their dkp for upgrades in favor of holding out for bis items so they had to put some rules in place to entice people to not hoard points.
---
Some would argue let them hoard their points, but it's not as efficient in a low gear drop rate environment and pisses a lot of people off when done excessively or unreasonably (at least it did on my server). Might work on a private server where you can do content for more than just a few months, but regardless, someone who is rolling on every upgrade is going to get ahead in the short term before bis people start catching up.
---
Well after 21 days I hit 54 with NO talent points used. 
---
I learned the hard way. Sunder was always the go to. I used to rend EVERY mob in a pack. Learned :P
---
Only race that can farm the other factions mount is humans to get the NE mount. 
---
If you do every single quest, at appropriate lvl you will be abit more than half revered. Then you've to farm morrowgrain for the last part. 
---
Cloth turn ins wasn't a thing until AV releases. But ye Once AV comes it'll be much easier, partly due the rep u gain inside AV, but also that they enables the cloth turnins. 
---
If you'll go cloth turnin way, make sure you do all the appropriate quests at their level for said faction to optimize the rep gained. As grey quests will grant almost no rep.
---
Edit: Case in point: Me reaching exalted with darna at lvl 50.

---
This video is the sole reason there are so many enhancement shamans on the beta right now.
---
I don't think classic is killing anything. Classic just opens a home for people who miss classic or don't enjoy retail (or whatever reason). It is a win win for me, if people don't like retail they might play classic, if people try classic and don't enjoy it, they might try retail. More people getting into WoW 14 years later is a good thing for the community. I will be playing both and play whatever I enjoy most at the time.
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
SMACKED DOWN BY FACTS AND LOGIC
---
Agreed. Going for that mana efficiency.
---
You just keep on giving
---
Find a healer and make friends this will get you threw the leveling
---
Megabit and megabyte are two different things though no? I was always taught that the rule of thumb was 1:7, you can transfer at roughly a 7th of your connection speed, so a 100mbit connection can roughly transfer 14 megabytes per second. This has held true during the different speeds I've lived with.
---
That‚Äôs great! Do you plan on being as successful this second time around?
---
Gonna be Alliance (my friends want to roll so I'll go with them) and will be playing Nelf Hunter. I'll probably play as much as I can but will have a full time job. I have 5 friends with me who wants to play as well and will pick healer/tank. If you're interested in adding 6 new members in your guild, pst me! I'm more of a PvP kind of guy but I'd like to do PvE too for Classic since I didn't really reach that far (was around 50-55 when TBC came out. End-game content is going to be fresh for me and I'm so excited to experience it with friends and potentially other gmates!
---
Cmon, stay in wow spirit lol
---
Yep, that‚Äôs me. Friday morning, I ran some tests in the Beta on known quests and they gave full rep when gray. However, after Friday afternoon‚Äôs WSG patch, I ran some more tests and verified that rep decay is now in effect for gray quests. You can see the results of my tests in this thread:
---
/r/classicwow/comments/bshono/regarding_rep_gains_on_grey_quests_closed_beta/
---
EDIT: And to answer the OP‚Äôs original questions, you have the rep decay formula right. Usually the decay of 20% per level starts at six levels above the quest level, when the quest starts first turns gray (relative to the level of the quest, which is not the same as the minimum level you can get the quest).
---
Also, very few of the lower level quests give spillover rep, but a good number of the quests in the secondary zones do give spillover rep. So, definitely quest in your target faction‚Äôs zones from the start, but also supplement with higher level quests from the other factions to benefit from 25% spillover rep as well.
---
it will be successful for a maximum of a couple of months. after that people will probably stop playing wow for a time and come back with the addition of the next expansion.

Backpedal sprint vanish cheap shot ss kidney celly
---
Warriors were the most popular class back in vanilla by a landslide.  There is a huge difference between hunter and warrior players.
---
Hunters have a very easy time leveling up (relatively speaking, still is slow and tedious with its own challenges) and are not incentivized to partake in grouping as often as other people.   Hunters needed to maintain things, but that was the extent of it.
---
Warrior players, much against everyones' desire, were forced to learn 2 playstyles.  DPS and tanking.  Most of the time we had to be the ones to form the group, otherwise we would simply not get into them due to so much competition.   
---
The main difference is one class was forced to take initiative and experience true leveling hell, where as the other was able to coast through the leveling experience and never had to worry about true competition for most of their gear (speaking from an alliance perspective).
---
Hey all, been lurking on this sub for a week or two due to the classic hype. Took me this long to remember that my original guild was one of the top guilds in vanilla's early raiding scene and that we'd made a couple videos back then (early 2005). Definitely brings back some nostalgia while providing a slice of what new classic players can expect when they bite into the original experience. I can be seen a thankfully few times in the video as Zzat, orc Warrior, thankfully because during the majority of the fight my camera was pointed at the ground while attempting to blindly whirlwind the whelps. While the videos aren't much by today's standards, apparently they were inspiring enough to be reuploaded by a few people over the years. Enjoy!

We were Discordia, formed in vanilla beta by a bunch of competitive Warcraft 3 players and teamed up with some MMO vets who steered us through this unknown territory.  We played horde on Archimonde, which was one of the largest servers of the day and sported a huge population on both factions. Other big guilds were here too, Nurfed being the notable one I can remember. Depending on who you ask, we had the world first/second Onyxia kill, another guild having downed a tauntable Onyxia 24 hours before us, and we had to face a hotfixed un-tauntable version making it more difficult for the tanks. We had some more firsts in MC as well as I believe 4th or 5th Ragnaros.

If you don't level cooking while leveling don't worry - leveling it later with fishing is even easier.
---
1. You're not stacking defense, so you're getting crit more
---
2. The build isn't dependent on enrage. Fury talents, independent from enrage, help to generate more threat than prot does. Read the portion of my post regarding rage generation.

---
Well just fuck anyone that plays any game and only goes for end game content, turning progress in a game a chore/barrier is just dumb.

Turning it off implies that it's something the players control. Getting rid of it implies it won't exist anymore.

---
Waiting for this to go on sale, I never buy total wars on launch after the shitshow that was Rome 2
---
That is true in that case, but I really feel when you are tanking a boss at low level, the boss shouldn't be hitting for 30-50 damage. The boss should be a threat to the tank. This dude switches out of bear form, loses threat, regains threat and the Boar hits him for 38 damage. Seems fishy.
---
The quests for Dungeon Set 2 (Tier 0.5) won‚Äôt be available until phase 5 (the AQ content).
---
Mindflay works too, and you can juke healers with rank 1 shadow word pain. The one reason I've been considering not playing a hunter is that they seem to do very mediocre damage without a good ranged weapon, and I feel like getting one would take me a very long time due to my limited time to raid.
---
They did when they were 11. No gainfully employed adult does.
---
 I think classic TBC should be rebalanced around level 60. Don't increase  the level cap or the core game mechanics. Don't add flying mounts.  Adjust the outland zones to be available for questing from 45-60. It's  all just HORIZONTAL content to flesh out the classic experience.
---
Elemental is honestly a really good spec, with burst potential. 
---
For everything except raiding, that is.
---
I simply CANNOT wait to see my first horde around level 20-30 (likely in STV/Alterac/STM/Deso) and stay behind them in stealth for a while... cry a little inside because I'm sword combat spec and this will take 10 seconds instead of 2 (I just want a sweet, juicy ambush) and wait for my perfect opportunity to MURDER the hell out of them.   
---
Rogues are so much fun to play. When they retaliate by seeing you later in the zone, and you successfully Vanish away, then go back and kill them at the proper opportunity... \*sniffle\*... its glorious and makes me laugh hysterically behind my keyboard.
---
That‚Äôs why you do skinning + another gathering that you can track
---
Seems a bit ridiculous.  Vanilla WoW was fun, but it's not the be all and end all.
---
[WRONG!](https://youtu.be/6PQ6335puOc?t=21) :-)
---
God I love this scene ^^
---
That is pretty cool! Did you get into the beta this time?
---
Yeah from what I can guess it wasn‚Äôt added until patch 2.01, which is when they added 41 point/tbc talent trees but the level cap was still 60.
---
And fleet footed wasn‚Äôt made useful until patch 2.3 from when it got buffed from 4%/8% to 8%/15%
---
I do kind of wish they would put the 2.01 trees in instead of 1.12 .
---
Seems annoying that ‚Äúoh you know that thing that was really annoying and took years to fix? Yeah well they did fix that is in patch blablabla 10 years later‚Äù
---
I forget how spoilt we are with all the little quality of life things. 
---
.... I don‚Äôt miss farming poisons or blinding powder for example, although I wont mind buying them from a vendor like during tbc.
---
i know I know... quality of life improvements are a double edged sword : difficulty and inconvenience is the nature of the beast that makes up the vanilla experience.
---
I think this is the simplest and most accurate thing I've seen mentioned here.
---
I personally don't feel it is hard to master hunter compared to most others, but it is extremely easy to make a mistake that can wipe a group.
---
If I can hit level 35 I‚Äôll be happy.
---
warrior+priest sounds very easy and good to do, since you can just open with dot into wand and then play the warrior, go back to priest if you ever need heal.
---
Maximizing your dps in PvE is actually much harder than most, if not all, classes.
---
But its YOUR post talking about watching YT lol.
---
You're right, they aren't 100 percent the same. It's really important for analogies to be 100 percent the same.
---
Interesting point about the NE armor shred item.
---
I wonder if they are soul bound or tradable. I've never paid attention with it because I usually used it soloing the furbolg cave if I couldn't find anyone.
---
Might be an interesting pvp grind before bgs come out to level a few characters to get the item early and trade them to a pvp main.
---
Dumbing them down for you, considering you aren't able to defend your stance very well, but you can keep going if you like.
---
I played both factions in classic and BC so your lucky to have that option. I most likely wont go paladin at launch. I think ill do Hunter since it was my first character ever and it will hit me right in the nostalgia. I will prob make a pally after that way il have a fun time leveling up a second character.
---
In 4 years at my current work this is legitimately the only period of 2 weeks I could not get off as the heads of 2 departments are out (maternity leave and getting married). Last 90 days is going to be trying to find a way to either play from work (open office :/) or find a way to get off work. (ya never know, not giving up hope)
---
I've seen Paladins tear up Warlocks on beta.
---
Yikes, dude. What did he ever do to you? I swear, people get mad about the tiniest things these days.
---
Honestly most people will be playing them for their excellent group healing and utility for raids. While another portion will be chasing those sweet, sweet 2h Wind Fury procs and Elemental Overloads. I‚Äôm curious to see how many actually make it to 60 though. The totem quest lines are a serious pain.
---
No class, spec, where rag is useful is useful in pvp tho.. Rag is a terrible weapon.
---
The problem isn't binary. There's more than 2 viewpoints.
---
It really depends on how tight your budget is.
---
Byte is a capitalized B. Megabytes per second would be MBps. 
---
1 bit is 8 bytes.
---
speed runs are for alts man unless you're going for world first (if so Good luck man!) Me I'm leveling a healer or a tank so I will be grouping all the time and on a pvp server
---
I call bull on that... no one had any idea what hunter was truly capable of (or lack there of) in 2004 lol... no one had enough time to do anything what so ever, and so few people actually played the beta.  
---
Hunter was never considered weak by any means, but they got a bad rep due to people rolling on crap they shouldn't be and failing to properly control their pet.
---
Thank you for your opinion.
---
Looks like you're fine with sacrificing the gold to constantly respec. So what's the issue? It's unbalanced? If it feels a little too expensive, then it's working as intended in my opinion. 
---
Is epic mount training too expensive? Does grinding rank 14 take too long? Is it too hard to find a raid group that will put up with your complaining? These are all features, man, and I promise it's all been well thought-out. 
---
I'll quote /u/Taliv1 : 
---
"You don't like it, therefore it's arbitrary and no one ever thought about it? You underestimate the vanilla wow designers."
---
By the way, I dont have any issue with discussing game features. I take issue with your attitude in the rest of your comments, which sucks.
---
Quite the opposite, quite frankly.
---
I went on a vanilla private server just to see what the hell I was getting into, and I got to like level 20 (I had already gotten more than enough of what it was like) and I don‚Äôt really want to go any further because then I‚Äôd feel like I was wasting my time considering how the launch is only 3 months away. So, with a new final fantasy 14 expansion in 1 month, im taking one month to try and see if I can finally hit diamond in league, then swapping between league and FF14 until classic launches, with the master chief collection hopefully making its jump to pc somewhere within that timeframe.
---
It's been a ton of fun. I Google lots of things after a couple attempts because I get irritated with puzzles easily (I know, great choice of game lol) but it's been very enjoyable. My gf is also doing her own first playthrough as well.
---
My stance defends itself. Examine the psychology of the average twink player. Most of them are pathetic people, generally ineffective, desperate to feel some sense of accomplishment in their lives. Twinks are kids that got benched from their tee-ball teams.
---
Yeah they should just kick you out of stress test. Saves time and work for everyone apparently :D
---
They already told us nearly no beta invites anymore so dont check it until you get an email.
---
No way are they going to split the community like that.  Almost everyone I know who is joining classic are really only doing so in hopes of TBC landing someday.
---
If they don't force a transition, then they wont do it.
---
You are aware of the fact that he is resposible for Classic WoW happening, right?
---
I tea bag them.  That's practically the same thing.
---
Wait, you think inflation has decreased the value of a dollar by half since 2004?
---
The drop chance of those mount was painfully low tho..
---
This is a barely passable truth. If you aren‚Äôt having threat issues in a mitigation spec, there‚Äôs no reason to play the fury-prot hybrid build. The build you‚Äôre talking about is meta when your group is geared enough to constantly give you threat problems, speed runs, etc. Definitely not fresh. If you tank week one as fury-prot hybrid, you are trolling.
---
yeah i'm gonna play the shit out of classic, but i really hope they're gonna release TBC in 2 or so years, since the classes were so much more fleshed out, i mean just look at the dumpster fire that is vanilla enhancement shaman. Or things like ret paladin, boomkin (which is still a bit weird but it's not "lol good one, go buy hide of the wild") and shadow priest
---
Tbh It wouldn't bother me that much if they implemented it, but yea it being expensive would make it better in my case.
---
Never worked in my experience, kind of people that gank lower levels take their attempt at sociopathy pretty seriously.
---
Hi, /u/badgerbacker3872
---
Where is the vent server icon?!?! üòÇ
---
Got perhaps a talent calculator link for that ? Would love to see. Iv'e never played priest before, only ever had experience as a Blood Elf Paladin during TBC in early 2008. Going priest this time due to two friends who are gonna be warrior and mage so going priest would fit in nicely in our lil group.
---
You can play around with the last point, going 2/3 imp HS and 5/5 DW spec. The important thing is 5/5 defiance, 1/5 imp. shield block and last stand in prot.

---
On a private server I raided as a holy pally when I was actually 31/0/20. I had all the important healing talents in holy so I healed just fine and a decent amount of ret talents where I can run around the world not completely gimped and PvP'd as a Two handed SoC Shockadin.
---
Life moto
---
Just yesterday, Asmon made fun of the people posting his highlights with over-the-top thumbnails and clickbaity titles and said he doesn't approve of any of it. Maybe you shouldn't be so quick to hate on the guy.
---
No, it's not OTC. In fact, even with a prescription, you can only get a 30 day supply and they will not refill it again until the end. You will fail a drug test without a prescription to back up why it is in your system as well. Going to doctor trying to get a prescription will vary wildly from doctor to doctor, because there are alternatives that can be taken that aren't stimulants like adderall. Some won't prescribe them at all, and just refer patients to avoid the hassle.
---
What? I think you misunderstood or I wasn't clear. In many games these days, leveling is irrelevant. It is so easy as to be pointless. Which I hear is an issue with retail these days? Many games I find leveling gets in the way of the 'harder' end game content. 
---
In vanilla it was 'hard' the whole way. Leveling felt fun and rewarding rather than being something you just quickly got out of the way. 
---
The fun for vanilla was being part of the world and the community you played with and all going through that together. If you just solo aoe mob grind in a corner by yourself to reach end game. Then start complaining about nothing to do, that is your own fault.
---
Plus with 40 people, it‚Äôs a lot easier to accommodate 2-3 hybrid builds than it is in today‚Äôs lower group size raids.
---

You can change that, however you need to delete your cookies and cached browser content, which you can do in your browsers settings.

After you delete cookies/cache, you are presented with a "blank slate" home page on youtube, and can then influence what you get recommended by using relevant search terms.
---
The issue is how it impacts pvp because people dont want to respec.
---
Just watched this yesterday. Man what time to be alive
---
Think again.
---
Elitism was the worst it ever has been back in vanilla, because people who were among the 'elite' raiders were far above those who were incapable of reaching those heights.  
---
It wasn't until TBC that this started to change a bit, because people who had T4 were considered great players even if they were incapable of spending time in T5 content.  This was due to how harsh the learning curve was for things like KZ and the other 2 raids.
---
didn't they say at first that we would get no email and it would be directly flagged into the launcher?
---
Very cool, I played with a few of the VM raiders that hung around after the guild retired from raiding in a pug group. Still remember a bunch of that guild. Kold, Sixthy, I forget the rogues name but I think it started with an R, he was very poetic. Good memories :)
---
You bet I'm fucking binding eye of killrog.
---
People like you are about 70% of the reason people hate on Asmon. You'd think you'd want to support a streamer you like, but instead you turn people off of watching him because you want to be a little shit.
---
The points for transmog are that in the long run, gear appearances aren't invalidated. Imagine putting all the work into making T2 but that set's appearance never being used again after the period in which it is relevant. If retail continued the no-transmog route we'd have fifteen years of artist assets not being used as everyone is funneled into the few current sets.
---
Additionally, to my knowledge most tier sets in Classic aren't particularly good til T2.5 or T3 depending on the class, so those going for BiS will spent most of the game in various states of clownsuit, not just an intermediary period. There will be very short stretches of the game where your character actually looks cohesive, this isn't like when vanilla was current and people just wore a full tier set because 'that's just what you do'.
---
I can agree that for the game Classic is, no transmog is reasonable. But I do not agree that no transmog could stand the test of time over a decade of content and artist assets.
---
Mind flay's icon looks like a melting face, so it is referred to as a spell that "melts faces".
---
Arguing against a single element of vanilla not being perfection is a losing fight here.
---
Weird jerk, but ok
---
I would like dual spec... But I would like to have it unlocked by an epic lvl 60 quest. Have the quest take you all around the world, with different parts of the quest requiring you to be in different specs.  At the end it gives an item with a 24 hour cooldown  or so to activate your dual spec.
---
On private server launches I just go by feel, if I'm struggling on a quest I skip it and I can make it up by grinding mobs that aren't as contested.
---
It helps to know how much exp you get for certain quests. Like, there's a really pain in the ass STV quest that gives something like 100 exp.
---
The originals lasting potentially days were fucking hell. Both being in there (it was epic for sure... but still hell) and waiting for the queue. Longer games meant longer queues as you wait for someone to drop or a new battle to begin. This was made worse by faction imbalance in servers. The lesser faction had an easier time getting in.
---
I was half joking and wishing, but I'm on my phone and I'm pretty sure it's specific to my account and video history - clearing cache on the app doesn't wipe it out, unfortunately.
---
I've been bit by this phenomenon.  After the Classic beta and official release date were announced I suddenly burned out on every other game.  Even City Of Heroes.  I've loaded up Warcraft 3 (never played it before) but I've barely started it yet...just the intro campaign.  Otherwise it's just the occasional Overwatch round.
---
I don't even want a beta invite because I don't want to burn out on Classic before it starts, and I'm not getting one anyway because I canceled my subscription in 2011.  3 months to go...
---
Disgusting behavior. 
---
Fight in *every* engagement you think you have a chance of winning, no matter how duplicitous you have to be. Have no mercy.
---
Run away or hide from every encounter you don't think you can win. Anything else feeds their ego.
---
Never grovel and debase yourself in front of the opposition.
---
enough with the relabeling memes or movies turned into wow memes
---
Well its better than to check the launcher daily i would say. I mean your and mine chances of getting into the full beta are well below 0 %. Enjoy tomorrow for a sneak peek and wait until august. 
---
I mean the beta servers are infested with streamers+followers anyway.
---
meh it's fine, guild master is a warlock or druid or w/e  and one of the officers is MT
---
Right!? I'm so bored I can't seem to wanna play anything.
---
Of course he's a troll.  He wants to be a druid.  It's right there in the post.
---
Agreed. I love classic but damn it are the graphics bad. Not quite going back to play halo without the remaster bad, but still pretty bad.
---
&gt; dps night just have to watch threat a little closer
---
If you‚Äôre talking about a pure fury spec (off-tank), then yes. But you seem to be referring to the fury-prot hybrid build, which would experience the opposite of what you are describing. Fury-prot hybrid is the meta for giga end game raiding *specifically because* of additional threat requirements from your leet dps.
---
This PC... it looks good but, it‚Äôs... wrong.

cons: not the best in their field(s) at anything (except WSG flag carrying)
---
Na I missed out. My old account no longer exists and my current one is somewhere around 2010 I think.
---
I probably wouldn't play a lot as I am saving my time for its release.
---
Change 24 hour to a 7 day cooldown and I'd support it! I fully believe there should be a way to unlock a dualspec that resets on tuesdays with raid instances.
---
This! Mordhau is the only game I play atm because it's a great 24vs24/32vs32 battleground PvP game.
---
Got in a Week ago, still no Email. Better check the launcher
---
Omfg LimeWire, dat p2p malware.
---
SCBW was a MASTERPIECE. So many hours in that series.
---
im a fan of sharding for this reason. 90 percent of Day 1's willnot make it to 60. I really dont want mass server bloom, like Wrath, just to have empty shells like MOP after every one rage quits
---
Working as intended. Sacrifice something.
---
edit: I figure you might be trying to say that 50g respecs affect PVP negatively overall. You think it would be better if everyone in battlegrounds was using a PVP appropriate spec? And a 25g respec fee would allow this? Someone screenshot this thread, Blizzard might be hiring developers
---
If you mean by firemage bug is that the damage of the ignite of all mages count towards the damage of one single mage and you can keep stacking ignite that's not a bug it was in vanilla, can confirm played a mage.
---
If not then it will probably be fixed and yes I know warlocks do catch up but I do like the concept of a dps class not doing as much damage as a class that is specifically designed to do a lot of damage instead it's useful by other means (summons, curses, soulstones, healthstones etc)
---
Improved roads would be pretty sweet if they gave it some kind of pvp aspect.
---
More boats fits into my hope that eventually they will flesh out the classic world. Why not have crews on the boats? And why are there so many empty buildings? Classic has so much more potential as wow 2
---
Male lol
---
This is desirable.
---
I am a woman and I remember very well the person that got me hooked on the game.  I was told I could play an Elf, ride a tiger, have a bow, collect animals that would fight with me, and hide in the shadows.  They had me at ride tigers.  So I made a hunter, was given 10g and here I am today lol, many many adventures later.
---
My comment wasn't meant to be serious... but yeah I'm gonna play this game hardcore lol. I'm not gonna grind R14 though, that's just too much effort for me.
---
That's my only worry with classic, that every server is just gonna have  a bunch of streamers ;(
---
I've seen people commenting about making a list of what streamer is going to what server when classic launches so hopefully that happens so I can avoid these people like the plague
---
And how the crap are we suppose to know that is an actual vanilla video?  
---
At least put a little thought into a post before calling out many other people.
---
I have no alliance to Asmongold, I just don't understand why he would be singled out, especially if it's not a "hate post". The OP could have just as easily put "wow classic -explicitlyexclude" as the search terms. 
---
Not to mention the OP claiming that knowing how to exclude phrases from a search is tech savvy. I'm sorry, YouTube, as a platform, is not "tech", it's Social Media.
---
What I meant with disrespectful is just that if you're typing/talking with a lot of people around you and you know they can't understand your language; I do to a certain extent find it disrespectful to continue IF you are able to communicate in a language everyone can understand. It's sort of like trying to keep other people out of your conversation while talking in a public space. 
---
Not sure how to explain it better but I hope you understand what I mean. I don't mean that you can't talk in another language if you literally can't speak anything else. But if you are fluent and everyone else around you can't understand your native tongue and you deliberately try to keep your convo 'secret' around others it just comes off in a very rude way I think.

Why? 6% for both horde and alliance classes? If 20% of all characters are equally split between horde and alliance, something being at 6% but representing 50% of players isn‚Äôt too bad. 
---
But why are priests so low? People don‚Äôt like to heal?

Fucking shamans purging off my hots.

Why would we? I want world pvp to exist and I think many of us still will after 18 months.
---
You didn't have to play for all 19 hours. You play all night, go to sleep, go to school, come home, queue up and get into the same exact AV as the night before.
---
It was just a neverending battle. It was large enough to feel like real world pvp without one side dominating the other due to server population.
---
Gods*
---
The ignite bug is a bug, I just couldn‚Äôt remember if it‚Äôs in Vanilla.
---
Shockadins are a thing though and they're fun to.
---
Hey, someone has to be happy about losing =)
---
I'm making the assumption that if you already have a character you get queue priority I might be wrong.
---
I think blizz will underestimate players at the start, or rather go the usual route of, why get servers that can handle the amount of people at the very beggining of an expansion (in this case classic) when you won't need them for later. So the launch will be server crashes and queues and stuff as usual.
---
I've a feeling they will disallow multiboxing for classic. Because that's one of the most gamebreaking/economy thing that u can do in vanilla. 
---
This is part reason why pservs always disallow them. But everyone would multibox and solo with their own 5mans. 
---
Altho what speaks against that they would disallow is, it takes a sub per account, so blizz might allow it just purely based of that. 5x subs is better than 1. 
---
But ye i hope it'll be disallowed.
---
Easy Dwight. Way to miss the point on pretty much all of that.
---
used to game in vanilla with a dude named Nucular. Dope ass mage.  
---
Miss the guy and the crew. Sup to all the arthas bro's out there.
---
swapping specs constantly is expensive, you'll have to do enough farming to keep up. 
---
you can play shadow priest full time but be aware that raids will only ever take 1 and they only do that because it gives warlocks extra shadow damage.
---
if you're not looking to raid then it doesn't really matter of course, but if people see a priest they will probably expect them to be a healer.
---
I'm pretty sure I'm going to play on a PvE server. Played on a private server and I grew pretty tired of getting ganked. I'd rather just do my PvP in battlegrounds and be able to chill in the open world. Hahaha I wish it was easier, both classes seem fun and I only want to main one because I already know that I want to have a rogue alt once Bg's come out to level up and mess around with in lower brackets. But I like all your points about hunter.
---
I‚Äôm bored of them all, but I do have beta so I get to be even more bored of them when I can‚Äôt play the beta.
---
I don't think a rated arena would work but I'd LOVE to see the casual "war games" make a come back. In my opinion the resilience stat is mandatory for a functioning max arena but it's sure be fun to fuck around with
---
I think you need to refresh yourself on that.
---
That's a good idea. do your raiding in your raiding spec, then use the item to switch to your farm / pvp spec until Tuesday, pay for a respec to raid again and the item comes off cooldown.  Essentially a 50 g on use item per week.
---
I'm still sad my parents gave away my old PC that had all my old WoW screenshots in. I tried tracking it down but the damage was already done.
---
Calm down guys! Hear me out before you downvote this post. I promise you I'm going to be reasonable.
---
Shamans, druids and priests uses pretty much the same gear until nax you are pretty much fighting 12-14 ppl for your gear as a healer.
---
Seeking others for \[NA\] \[Alliance\] \[PvP\] \[PST\]
---
I'm actually looking to connect with new players or those who only played WoW a bit in the past (I only played a month at launch).
---
I think it make for a more fun experience to all learn and grow together.
---
Will be maining a hunter, and looking to make great PvP content.

&lt;Envy&gt; PvP Server, Alliance | PvE Raiding Guild | EU
---
Envy are a long-running guild from private servers and retail looking for additional players at launch and beyond.
---
But first, let me start by giving you some general information about us.
---
History:
---
Formerly known as Millenium, Inside Job and Cobra Kai across various vanilla servers; we as a guild have been able to achieve consistant progression through content from release, while earning a position among top guilds. We‚Äôve also accumulated a massive amount of vanilla information over a span of several years, and it‚Äôs safe to say our resources are some of the best out there. We are a moderate raiding guild with an experienced core that has been together for over two years now, and we plan to continue our success come Classic.
---
Wednesday, Sunday and Monday
---
18:30 GMT - 22:30 GMT
---
Our raids take place on Wednesday, Sunday and Monday night at 18:00 until 22:00, and we prefer our raiders be available for slighty longer on Monday nights for progression periods; currently looking to start MC progression within three-weeks of launch. We will also host optional ZG raids (once released) throughout the week at the same time. We are currently seeking exceptional players of all classes and roles at the moment, though healers are always highly sought after.
---
We have big plans when Classic comes, but we can‚Äôt do it without your help! If Envy interests you, you can find more detailed information on how to join by visiting [https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/](https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/)
---
Additionally you can contact myself or probability#1475 on Discord via DM for more information.
---
This game will consume your life. Tread carefully.
---
Good for him! Still obnoxious in my view ! A good streamer shines cause he's got something special, what Asmon does could be done by anyone else that's what makes it annoying to see his face everywhere
---
well, as i said, you need to be logged out of google services for this to work, obviously, because otherwise the algorithm still uses the data it has stored, server side, for your profile.
---
i guess you have an android phone, which means you are pretty much locked into the google services. depending on vendor type, there may still be things you can try (access yt via the browser in incognito mode instead via the app for example), but in this situation, i'm afraid you're pretty much out of luck.
---
what do you mean by world first? thousands of people have already done everything they‚Äôve done on stream...
---
There we have it, where did the big bad twink touch you?
---
Make friends with a priest, trust me ;)
---
I found that for me Firefox used around the same and sometimes more than Chrome.
---
depends on the faction
---
Horde has 3priests, always, due to dispel (ally has pala/priest, pala makes ally better than horde), you always have 1-2 mages (elemental if the mage is really good) since they can defend well and assist with everything, even emergency flag carry.
---
Warriors increase with gear, you don't really want a lot of them but alliance can go up to 3 warriors in t2 early, usually when AQ hits (AQ gear necessary to even compete it is that good) since they have paladins making wars much better (windfury totem is great but a cced warrior cannot proc windfury, paladins get rid of all cc and cannot really be cced).
---
Hunter only 1 if you use one, great for defense and they scale well with gear (for pvp, not pve). No idea if 2 hunters work, AQ40geared + hunter can probably burst ridiculously hard if the enemy team utilized more clothies or leather than usual.
---
Druid one for flag carry, resto spec more or less. Preferred.
---
Rogue 0 to 1, rogues make for amazing defenders and assistance of their own flag carry due to their CC. Hard to play properly thus 0 to 1, a mediocre rogue is a liability more often than not.
---
Shaman is ele/resto, rare early on but once AQ hits ele damage gets ridiculous they melt everything before going oom (naturally they heal dispel poison etc mostly) so you can see up to 2, no idea if people would even go 3 but i doubt they'd be oom too often. Enhancement does not exist.
---
Priest is 3 for horde as mentioned, alliance varies. Always disc/holy shadow is trash. Alliance runs priest on defense only since they can dispel free action pot, huge boon. Offense paladin preferred.
---
Warlocks are non existent early on they require gear but geared warlocks are S tier in pvp, ridiculous instant damage and tanky as hell. Fear is very powerful and deathcoil counters druids. I can imagine some teams using more locks than usual if the locks wear aq40+ gear due to how op it is.
---
Gimme dat TBC. I'm s pve server homie, so flight is fine, after a gate keep. (5k gold was fairly hard to come by)
---
Damn! That was fast.
---
Your post just proves that you know nothing in this regard. Not even a little thing and the only source for any information you have is from reddits' jibber jabber. But on the other hand your anger, rage and self-adoration is cute and funny. So keep on posting!
---
yep that was my point. they said that we would get no email..
---
Any organized PvP interferes with the core game, because it takes players out of the world.  BG's already do enough.
---
You have to realise that these polls are very accurate (because of how statistics work), but ***of the sample population***.
---
So the class demographics you're seeing are the choices of the knowledgeable and/or hardcore players, and no-one else. Because these are the people who frequent the places these polls appear.
---
The demographics on the real launch servers will be significantly different (probably at least 2-3% shifts per class) due to then including every kind of player, at every knowledge level and playstyle.
---
Additionally the demographics will probably change by at least 2-3% just based on time. Some people may decide they don't like their first choice, or just the attrition less invested players.
---
So, overall, it wouldn't surprise me to see swings as large as 5% per class. If you look at a real server 4-6 months after launch, vs the community polls we're seeing now.
---
I dont know why people keep repeating this meme. Its not funny nor true.  
---
Every class/spec has something unique it brings. If not fully unique, then coupled with other aspects of the class (for example hunters can soak some things with turtle, so can rogues with cloak; but hunters are ranged)
---
I am almost debating putting game time on my other account and just dual leveling (maybe figuring out some multiboxing software?)
---
Psst, hey buddy.  It's only $15.  That's like a cup of coffee.  Skip one a month and you can play this Classic for years to come!
---
Well, now you know why I play Warlock =)
---
And me and my boomkin homie, would find em, Id Levitate him as he Typhooned em off thier mounts to their death.
---
Same boat. All games are trash now that i got a taste of the nostalgia. Might have to buy a pc again and get ready for classic launch.
---
Yeah unfortunately weapon procs in forms don't happen until WOTLK :(
---
Fuck you Blizzard. Take my $16 that you stole and pay someone to test it.
---
I think my first character at launch will be a Rogue with herbalism/alchemy/cooking/fishing/first aid all fully maintained at my level.  Levelling a Rogue is hard enough as it is but I'm going all-in with professions and secondary professions as both a way to keep me going but also as a way to generate funds for my epic mount.
---
From personal experience horde side priests and warriors(geared), alliance priests, mages and warlocks. The ultimate answer any experienced player from vanilla or private servers will tell you is play what you're most interested in because the grind to 60 and beyond is so long you'll lose interest playing something you hate.
---
But when you're 3 inches short of pleasing a woman you can always just gank level 30s to fix your ills.
---
Yep pretty much! I still consider myself clubbing someone to death with my stat stick
---
If you are trying to level quickly then you need to decide if a quest is taking too long and if grinding mobs instead will be faster. Only you know how fast you can grind mobs and if there are enough mobs nearby that you can grind easily, so no one else can make this decision for you.
---
If you are just using the guides to get some structure to your questing order and to avoid running back and forth to the same areas for different quests then go ahead and complete quests even if they are contested. Unless you stop having fun of course then go ahead and move on.
---
Well that we can agree on.
---
yeah i just want some kind of arena functionality. Doesn't have to have rewards or anything, can just be for fun.
---
yeah, them Lightning bolts give your mana bar the SUCC
---
So much knowledge but so much less patience.
---
Well if those streamers were smart they would avoid pvp servers. Not too smart playing on a pvp server when the opposite faction can see exactly where you are when streaming. The only way you wouldn't be griefed every moment you were in world was if you forced your army of fans to follow you wherever you went. Even then, ylthey would still die as rogues and other would make a bead line for him.
---
My first toon was a hunter. Got him to level 16 before just deleting him. Pets were terrible.
---
What about if you PvP fury?
---
Agree.  The way retail dual spec works would really harm the game imo.  I do think there is probably a way to make dual spec great in classic.  Epic level quest with large up front costs, like the 0.5 tier gear.  Have the quest grant an item that has a long cooldown for a free respec or even cause the respec cost to decay a stage or two instantly.  That way you bring a nice feature but make design it with a classic mindset.
---
Ready steady go

---
I was referring to dps'rs tanking 5 mans. Anyone can do it, just takes a shield and and slightly more attention from the party. 
---
I was also pointing out to mr walrus that a dual wield fury tank isn't running the standard dual wield fury dps build in gear or spec
---
Warriors still have two roles, just healing isn't one of them.
---
It won't be any where near as hard at Classic launch.  
---
Classic warrior has over 2x private server hp regen. You'll have help for essentially every quest 0-60, all zones will be super populated. You can group for any hard quests and you'll get tons of free druid/pally/priest buffs and heals just randomly while running around which makes solo levelling significantly easier.
---
Hell yeah I played on Earthen Ring back in the day too.
---
Where are you spending $15 on a cup of coffee?
---
No, but I did the wall jumping in STV to get to the cave and buy the SUPER rare tiger mount.
---
These people could be playing mid patch 1.5.0 and they'd be arguing how it doesn't count.
---
&gt;i cant make an argument so ill just act it off  
---
sad
---
Hunters have an extremely high skill ceiling, while being fairly easy to afk auto shot dps. The sheer presence of a pet allows for easy solo content which in theory makes the game easier for those less inclined. 
---
As for roles with the game, hunters are necessary in PVE content and serve vital roles in PVP. PVE we‚Äôre top tier DPS through BWL and are used primarily for Tranquilizing Shot and our ability to kite. In PVP we hold choke points extremely well and hound the ever living hell of clothies and healers. 
---
To me personally the difference between a mediocre hunter and a good hunter is pet control and feign death / trap macros. While there is a plethora of things that go into making a good hunter. Those who are able to control their pets which can add a significant amount of dps through them attacking and buffing raid. Feign death / trap macros, a hunter in a fight who is able to freezing trap a dead zone enemy, distance themself and either bandage or cast an aimed shot is the point in which I say to myself, ‚Äúok I would want this guy in my premade‚Äù.
---
Raid as resto (as basically every healer class is forced to) and collect your pvp gear in the process.
---
.
---
.......WHAT KIND OF COFFEE ARE YOU DRINKING???
---
I also thought, the item you get from the quest could have an on use effect of causing your respec cost to decay one or two stages, effectively making it cheaper to respec, but not an actual dual spec.
---
MC will be cleared within a day by private server xp guilds. You can do it in green/blue gear easily.
---
Playing alliance warlock for all those easy raid spots and free set pieces because there are no other warlocks around hell yeah baby, summon bot and candy vendor standing by.
---
Refer to previous post.
---
he got a clip in this video that windfury procs three times in a row, the first two he kills a mage, then he finishes another guy... that is what I call lucky af
---
Alliance warrior...go to wetlands...accidentally pull 4-5 packs of gnolls consistently. Learn to hate life.
---
I had so many X-fire screenshots for wow that are now lost to time.
---
Ah I see now, sorry. I thought you were still referring to the meta fury-prot build in your second paragraph.
---
Athene was good at the game but if you ever watched him streaming he played like shit a lot because he was engaging the stream more, Asmon is probably the same. He's done some pretty impressive stuff in the game that shows he's way above average, yeah not a Method raider or an elite PVP'er but he's not trying to be.
---
Even if you're way above average you can still play like shit if you're not focussed. I've seen a bit of him doing Armory and yeah he was playing really poorly a lot of the time, but his primary engagement is the stream, is trying to make it an entertainment show and the playing probably goes out the window as a result.
---
I've tried to stream in the past, It's extremely difficult for me to focus properly with that distraction, having to discuss or think about a topic and engage with others while I'm playing turns me into a bunny rabbit hopping keyboard masher. I ran a youtube channel doing Warrior guides at one point and was heavy into theorycrafting, going into the details of rend tick tracker timing and the finer elements of DPS optimisation for world speed kill ranking and other pointless endeavours, but I couldn't maintain that skill level without 100% focus and could easily turn into a buffoon of a player, very few people can play at 100% all the time.

For 48 hours, you would have to keep popping adderall pills. They don't last that long, even XR versions. If you've taken enough to be up for 48 hours straight, I'd imagine you are closer to tired as fuck but can't sleep than actual "Look at me lvl 48, 45 hours in #NoSleep til 60". They can force insomnia, but they can't make your body feel rejuvenated.
---
If it is, you wait till next raid
---
Wait, what? They are EASIER you say?
---
Enhancement will do well in wPvP if you get the drop on someone. Elemental will be a bit easier at wPvP since they have the ability to burst at range. You will mostly be trying to close the gap quickly to deliver your melee burst. But since there‚Äôs less buffing and support in unorganized wPvP, you will have some success and I‚Äôd imagine you will have a good time. I played a 39 ele twink which was a good time and there were plenty good enh twinks bc of the access to good 2h weapons and wf weapon.  Shaman is very good at burst though so that should give an advantage for the loose structure of open world, instant ghost wolf will be your friend here. 
---
Im currently working leveling as enh on a pserver before launch and it‚Äôs very efficient. I put on a lightning shield, drop a flametongue, shock an enemy, and melee twice and it‚Äôs dead. Very little downtime. 
---
I‚Äôll probably level as enhancement and respec to elemental/resto once there‚Äôs enough talents to make it more efficient. 
---
I don‚Äôt have the time to level, let alone gear up a warrior. They are incredibly gear reliant to do well. I had that experience the first time.
---
Yup this is Frostmane-US during BWL era. Guild is &lt;Grove Street&gt; which was PvP centric at the time. Which had some mixture of alts from bigger PvE guilds... Iniquity and others of the time. Our friends still joke about remembering him asking for help with the Jesus part of the video in guild chat, most didnt even give notice till it blew up on warcraftmovies and the memes about his mysterious disappearance or death. Good old classic WoW community in those times.
---
LFD/LFR, I just cant stand talking to people. So much easier to be teleported too. /s
---
For real though. Guild Banks. Would make my job as guild alchemist so much easier.
---
I'd love an option to just swap into retail graphics. I didn't play vanilla so the whole nostalgia thing does nothing for me.
---
I'd really like to play a Tauren without that vanilla head.
---
Get past that somehow, make it to STV, constantly pull 3 trolls and die....
---
Because classic is about you having fun, modern wow is a casino.
---
FTFY
---
I'd flag carry for wsg premades and I would get praised for doing a good job and patted on the head. The next week they forget who I was and I couldn't even get an invite if they needed 5+ spots filled.
---
I played an Ele/Resto in Vanilla it was rough to say the least. Looking forward to doing it again.
---
Quite funny you would say that, since I'll be playing a prot warrior, and don't have a problem with it.
---
you can tell that from the 208dmg  "Devastate" on his screen
---
People just want to try to replicate the experience they had the first time is all.
---
Ouf sounds like some dicks
---
I am not 100% sure myself.
---
One thing I am sure of is that rend is complete garbage in PvE back in vanilla, with only minor usage in PvP.  It almost isn't even worth keeping on your hotbar past like lvl 30 (kind of spitballing, but I think you get the idea).
---
Yes, solo levelling a warrior on private server is far harder than on Classic. The hp regen makes a huge difference. You really don't even need bandages/food as a warrior (it is nice and helps but you aren't completely screwed without it like you are on PS).
---
&gt;replicate the experience they had
---
What does this have to do with adding **new** ui changes that didn't exist back then?
---
I've actually considered playing with my fellow Swedes but I'm not so sure I want to join a server with people that already are well established on that server. I kind of just hope to make new friends and join a fresh guild through meeting likeminded people in game.
---
Is the server going to be a retail community moving Classic? I would assume so otherwise how do you know there will be a lot of Swedes? (I assume you'll be one of them so hej btw)
---
Played a Holy Paladin named OdoyleRules on Bonechewer but, it was in TBC.
---
This server-wide DKP system is very interesting. Might there be a video or blog post on the topic somewhere?
---
Eh most people will download basic UI mods for this. And I‚Äôm sure the player base for classic in 2019 is well aware of the top Addons and how to use them properly.
---
&gt; This game will consume your life. ~~Tread carefully.~~ **[LET'S DO THIS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4)**
---
Ive been having a lot of fun with Dauntless for the past week. Not classic fun, but Id give it a strong recommend
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. I am working lot‚Äôs of overtime now so I can fuck off at launch. I‚Äôd certainly drop everything if I got a beta key though....
---
Hmm, interesting.
---
When being rezzed by another player, the "Accept" button flashes telling you to accept it, in true kiddie mode fashion.  Not in Vanilla.
---
Dude add me on MSN so we can share those fuckin GIF emojies please.
---
You would need to be playing about 12 hours a day, every single day for that to happen.  That is assuming you do no instance runs unless the group is immediately headed in already, and you know 100%, without a doubt, where to go and when to go, which quests to skip and how to properly pull everything.
---
The first point is correct and should be fixed.
---
The two others were do-able with addons from the start and shouldn't be changed.
---
Didn't play wrath at all?
---
Chad the rogue adds a Gouge in there
---
Yes, most likely it will. I don't know how I feel about it personally.
---
Ya I felt like druid was one of the better flag defenders in AB too. Stealth, tracking, and immune to a bunch of CC. Oh well.
---
&gt; Eh most people will download basic UI mods for this.
---
There were no addons that could do these things
---
In the case of debuff tracking, it was an absolute impossibility for an addon to do that
---
The button is a picture of a turtle üê¢
---
Kevin Jordan streams on twitch, he was the class designer for vanilla wow.   I‚Äôm sure you could ask him for some class fantasy insight
---
then dont use these tools and act like its 2004 again, no one is forcing you.
---
From my memory, at 60 paladins are basically one of the best healers 90% of the time you will be healing. You'll never tank a raid, only 5mans, and very rarely will you be dpsing as ret, you might get away with it but I wouldn't expect it to happen till you have some good gear atleast. As far as this spec, you might see 1 per guild, not many ran like this. If they did, it was all for pvp. its more luck burst than consistent damage.
---
A little bit but, I X-fer to Storm-reaver for that. Wrath was kind of a garbage expansion in my book.
---
Well I mean people play a sham cause of windfury and chain lightning‚Äîthey heal cause you have to. The class fantasy is there.
---
The class fantasy of the priest is diddling young boys and healing big warriors. You role that class cause you‚Äôre set on healing.
---
Yeah sure spriests, all 2.5% of your raid.
---
Either dual spec or arenas (but with teams so you can only push with people on your realm)
---
depends on time zone. In the US, servers are actually going up on the 26th. I'm CST, so game goes live 5pm on Monday the 26th.
---
Good evening, looking for a guild for classic, I'm in the beta and working on my routes and refreshing myself to the pace of game. I played since vanilla launch recently going afk for lack of interest in BFA. I will be rolling a dwarf priest/holy for classic. Mature player generally looking for a fun setting to joke and push content with.

Will be leveling for 8ish hours a day the first week it is out on my undead mage/troll hunter (whichever I decide to level first). Mining and Skinning while I level for extra money, seriously focusing on professions once I am at the end of leveling/start of endgame (engineering lol). I plan on hitting level 40 after 7 or 8 days. 
---
Then I go back for my final year of college, but I still plan on being able to hit 60 two months after it has released. I‚Äôm going to get pre-raid BiS, focus on gold farming, dungeon crawling and PvP, possibly raiding. I am most looking forward to the long hours I will spend with some of my best friends during the first few weeks in Discord, leveling, gearing and world PvP with alliance dogs. 
---
For the Horde.
---
We back to hating asmon?
---
I‚Äôm trying to finish my first play through of Divinity OS2 before Classic comes out or I‚Äôll never get to it.
---
No not even a little and it's not fun. You'll die to trash a million times from bad WF procs. In addition to that your a terrible dps and an even worse nightfall carrier as it can't proc off of WF.
---
Seriously hope not.. It ruins immersion within the different zones. What happened to the good ol' trade chat?
---
I *think* most of people who are in this subred have played Vanilla?
---
Too many people worry about the diamant√© meters without considering class utilitant√©.
---
Not sure about Fury Warriors, but I used to have a 60 Arms Warrior and could dominant every class besides Frost Mages and would be consistently in the top 3 for kills in BGs. Took a while to master stance dancing, but it really makes a huge difference when you effeciently switch. I remember being decent with DPS but I never got to do any of the end game raids before TBC came out. I'm guessing you'd need to go Fury and stay in Berserk Stance, though.
---
That's what I said. Totally unacceptable but on Reddit it gets downvoted haha. Guess I'll leave this sub before classic even started.
---
Druids being able to keep costumes inbetween shapeshifting :(
---
Fuck that's quite bad, hopefully it's all fixed before launch.
---
No Shamans are the worst Nightfall users because wind fury can't proc it. The up time they have on it is horrible. Even a melee hunter would be better.
---
It was possible to create global chat channels at various stages in WoWs lifetime, however I can't exactly recall if the LookingForGroup channel for example was global during vanilla or if that was in TBC.
---
Having said that:
---
On the beta at least "/join world" seems to work.
---
Man i‚Äôve watched the Discordia Movies to death!
---
I've had a few queues. Largest was like 300 and it took a minute or two.
---
Imagine actually being serious about choosing human male. üòÇ
---
My first time tanking was on my paladin alt in TBC. I did tons of research before tanking anything of any importance with the spec, and fully geared myself to uncrushability/uncrittability before even speccing over.
---
So while my first dungeon run trying it out was rusty because I had to get used to all the nuances, I was pretty well prepared and I would say I was prepared as hell and as a result did it well. Highest content I tanked on her was a full Zul Aman run and waves in Hyjal.
---
So yeah. I wasn't a noob. I was an elite gamer.
---
&gt;Can you do it for the Home page and for "suggested" content? 
---
Yes, or at least, you can try to teach the algorithm what you don't like. Press the menu button next to a recommendation and [pick "not interested."](https://i.imgur.com/ukczkMG.png) This works on the site and the app.
---
If you're just using the web site another option is to use a browser extension that blocks all YouTube recommendations.
---
Achievements, they're a fun extra thing people can strive for with some cosmetic rewards tossed in. Hurts nothing and gives people an extra thing to do.
---
i'm sorry
---
Fuck adderall
---
lol that human butt tho, Thats why i play these fantasy games, so i can just be a boring ole human.
---
There‚Äôs nearly 120k member here, I think we‚Äôd be surprised at how many ‚Äúnew‚Äù WoW players are here since Classic WoW has become bigger than BFA, but idk..
---
Started Spring 2005. Accomplished absolutely nothing lol
---
They scan your computer when you play wow so it's pretty for them to tell even if you use a vpn
---
The problem is that it could be legit the same person using different computers.
---
Fiery enchants FTW!! I made a fortune selling those!
---
Me neither, that's why I thought it would be great to discuss it. It's been a huge part of private servers for years, some would find it devastating if it vanished.
---
It turns out that a perfectly balanced rpg is pretty dull and lifeless.
---
Dude I hit level 55 on a Druid and was wearing white gear still, I had no idea what I was doing in vanilla lolol
---
They definitely are, tbh I would play a druid in classic but PVE resto seems super boring.
---
D A M N!
---
The addon API is source itself. Just because I don't know of anyone doing it, doesn't mean it was impossible. You can make addons that do this with vanilla clients, thus you could do it in vanilla.
---
They might be a bit pessimistic, but the average time it took back when the game was new was like 320 hours across all classes... that is a lot of time.  
---
I am sure it will be way faster now days, but my guess is more like 250~ hours across all classes, and I feel that is actually generous.  Not to mention the world record was like 168 hours by someone who did things perfectly.
---
"Reason to quit working"....I feel like you already disqualified yourself if you have a job. Unless you've had like 30 in past 6 months because always late or no show from gaming all night. Start claiming Azeroth is better than reality to a doctor, and you might end up on some mental institution for hallucinations or on some prescription that turns you into a zombie.
---
I feel you on this one man! Thats why I am currently playing a vanilla private (since I did not get into beta) to just quest/and explore with my friend and get that out of our system before launch. Then on launch I will have had that experience again in vanilla while still using addons to be competitive and get  ahead on my server!
---
Hobbs if not your probly still doing it wrong.
---
Explain to me how giving a mini tutorial on using the google/youtube search interface constitutes an act of hate.
---
That‚Äôs it, back to nightfall duty for you. Our shaman‚Äôs wife is in labor tonight.
---
aoe looting would make my pp hard
---
I think its a no brainer to add them to the game and remove them in phase 3 or phase 4 depending on how long they want to give people to get them.
---
That's enough proof for me, thanks for collecting and sharing :)
---
10/10 post, hopefullly these apes finally stay quiet with their 15 year old "memories"
---
This kind of shit is stupid and is obviously not a bug. If anything it is the purists that will ruin the game.
---
Only deal with shadow priests elemental shamans and feral flag druids... horde might not  have no healers at all
---
The majority of people got their change.  They're playing it now with BFA.  I hope it works out well for them but I, like many other people here liked it better when a single AV could stretch on over several days.  The only time in recent years I've seen anything remotely come close to it was Guild Wars 2's World vs World in the first year.
---
Man of culture ahead of your time using Mozilla but disappointed to not see an AIM shortcut, msn messenger was for plebs
---
Read the guides, he tells you which to skip when unavailable and what to do instead.
---
Average time back then was 320 hours, and world record was 168 hours. 
---
This tool set to normal or fast is actually optimistic imo.
---
/world is indeed a private server creation. Difference is private servers made it an official channel while on beta it is not. It is a user created channel that can be locked and passworded like any other private channel guilds make for classes etc. Expect people to troll and mess with /world come launch.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt play for 8 years, I‚Äôm only subbed now because of classic and I wanted to reformat myself with the game, holy crap nothing is the same.
---
Oh I remember lmfao. Like the second time I ever played I put in like a 12 hour session on my friends computer while he was sleeping Haha. I used to live with my grandma who had a PC on dial up and my uncle lived there too. So I had to share with 3 people. I was in high school, so I would wake up at like 2 or 3 whenever my uncle went to sleep and I would play until I had to get on the bus. Get off school and take a nap lmfao. God it was bad.
---
I agree that the unarmored mounts should be in the game. So what if some people won't be able to get them.
---
Wait did he for real die?
---
Lmfaooooo. Basically what I'm thinking.
---
Wand shooting too. Have to press it twice before it shoots
---
I can only recall general and trade chat being a thing. Global or worldchat is something I only remember from my days on private servers
---
Yeah my first thought was "oh, yeah... Same realm" when I was wondering why the names were so short.
---
For some context, the only DPS advantage Humans have over Gnomes is +5 Weaponskill on Swords/Maces. No one actually knows what this entails. There‚Äôs just not enough actual empyrical data from that time to figure it out. 
---
The prevailing theory is that it increases your chance to miss or glance relative to the targets Defense skill. Bosses have ~315 Defense (we think), so Humans would have 305 Weaponskill. 
---
From the little data I‚Äôve seen it equates to 0.04% Hit Chance from the Racial, which is pretty negligible.
---
Same, never got the chance. Parents tossed the old PC while I was at university, without any word of warning. Was such sad news, still makes me sad I didnt get to keep anything from those early years.
---
You have to get to 60 first. That's the challenge of clearing it in the first week. It will not be done on the first day.
---
Yeah I finally just said fuck it and rolled on a private server. At least I can mess about with levelling paths and builds and stuff.
---
Kept telling myself that it would be a waste of time to start on a private server now, but then so would playing another MMO/looter game in the mean time. Whatever I play, it's getting dropped for classic.
---
never said that.... did you even read my comment. stm is close to horde territory and wetlands is close to ally territory again comparing the because they both have similar circumstances
---
This is surprisingly accurate.  
---
If we take into account that the world record back then was 168 hours by someone who planned a route, then if anything.. this tool set to normal or fast might be optimistic rather than pessimistic.
---
Lmfao money isnt the issue and I dont drink coffee :p it's mainly the time involved. When I was 14 it was one thing lol.
---
The 60 toons fighting over 3 skeleton spawns in Deathknell beg to differ
---
CDs do not reset on death.
---
I love spreading these rumors lol
---
His eyebrows and nose make a T
---
Which changes specifically from BFA?
---
&gt;and basicaly vanilla dungeons are a walk in the park...
---
UBRS is a walk in the park when you have a full BWL geared warlock and a mage from the same guild murdering everything and everyone and a warrior-tank from the partner-guild, who had to take off gear in order to generate enough rage...
---
My point is: SFK is not meant to be run with multiple close-to-30 players decked out in the available gear. Run the dungeon at the appropriate level, and it is challenging (no, not mythic+ challenging). Run it at lvl 30 and it's a walk in the park, as intended.
---
who has better sustainable dps during leveling? maybe lock
---
enha is probably the worst ‚Äúnot troll‚Äù tier pvp spec in the game, and its extremely gear reliant. no1 wants to invite enha shamans to their dungeon groups but you do you, have fun!
---
Right, but we're talking about fighting mobs lower level than you. As long as you out level your opponent, and you take them one at a time, you don't really have to eat all that often. Just take a 6 second break every minute to bandage and you're good to go. 
---
It's when you're fighting high level mobs (that block, dodge, parry, and rage starve you) that you might be eating all the time.
---
The issue with that is, all his followers upvote the hell out of any post about him. That's why we have 3 posts on the front page with the same exact stream/clip.
---
achievements.
---
never played one before
---
Yeah dude, this game is extremely addicting. If you're fine with that and you have the time, by all means go for it. I know I'm going to play the crap out of this game lol.
---
Warlocks in SL spec early on to carry through not so good gear, later on with gear (AQ+) warlock turns into a living god, everyone wants warlocks in premades or raids.
---
Mage, elemental spec once you have some good gear, high skill class but S tier, incredibly powerful if played well and versatile in premades (can do offense and defense, high damage instants making them a noob class as well).
---
Paladin, holy, immortal healer nothing else has to be said. Kings of offensive setups for ally, ret does not exist.
---
Priest, shadow does not exist, healers are in high demand. Dispel can dispel free action potion more does not need to be said.
---
Rogue is tricky, scales super well with skill but even a mediocre rogue is a liability. You need to be REALLY GOOD to be in a premade (otherwise 0 rogues) but it's worth it. Endgame PvE gear on a rogue is disgusting.
---
Warriors are meh, needs good teammates and gear but then a valuable asset. Sucks solo.
---
Hunters drop off in pve but in pvp they remain strong, hard to play but versatile and they keep casters in check. Great defenders. Gods in wPvP (outrange everyone, kite with cheetah) as anyone you want to kill will die.
---
Druids, stay away from this trash. Only good for flag carry due to their self sustain. Can't kill for shit. Can beat worse players ofc but do not torture yourself. Druids are ret paladin tier of shit in all aspects of the game.
---
Shaman only ele resto. Healing only is not in high demand but their general utility scales hard (wf totem, poison cleanse and purge) and once AQ hits a lot of spell damage mail exists and their damage skyrockets into oblivion, they annihilate people with lighting bolts (you are a hybrid keep that in mind).
---
In terms of tierlist it's elemental mage followed by warlock and then rogue. Lock probably SL spec due to their tankiness but others work. Rogue is the usual cb prep spec.
---
I agree with you.  They're welcome to think we're delusional and they also are welcome to stay in retail and expect and receive their participation rewards.
---
A lot of this happened during changes. It's a big part of the video with him changing specs and then relying on rnjesus to make enhance work lol.
---
How DARE you. In my day, my best friend was a tauren. You monster.
---
WR back then near the end of vanilla, was 168 hours by a guy who spent a lot of time planning a route and practicing it.  
---
If nothing else, if you use the WR as a judge, then this tool is optimistic when set to normal or fast.
---
&gt;and said he doesn't approve of any of it.
---
If he doesn't approve of it he can easily get them removed from Youtube with a single click via their copyright system, he just doesn't care to.
---
I used 31/8/12 spec back in the day.  My favorite opener on mages was to cold blood ambush, run through them, then gouge.  Commonly, they would blink but land still disoriented.  Then its backstab into KS and its lights out for the mage.
---
On the other hand I remember really good mages still making me look stupid from time to time.
---
Not sure that 4d 10h is eaven posible for all classes. And yes all the raid don't need to be 60 but you need a 60 tank and he needs atleast some gear and warriors are one of the slowest levellers in the game. I think 7 days might be a stretch. Alsow it was normal for the game to have server reset on Wednesday we get a Friday release if they keep Wednesday resets you have less time for a first reset kill
---
50g isnt broken.
---
Addon that increases the ignore list cap.
---
Mine on private server is constantly filled. Not just because of gold spammers, but anything from legitimate whisperer homophobia and insults, to people who were massive dicks in a dungeons and I want to ensure I don‚Äôt accidentally group with them again. As well as your insufferable trade chat trolls.
---
Can you believe Vanilla client only lets you ignore 20 max at once?
---
How dare you. You should be ashamed.

The Blizzcon demo ran off of 7.3.5; the current beta is a variant of the BfA client. Not sure why they swapped over to the new one, I'd imagine it has something to do with cybersecurity.
---
Dude, this is NOT a bug. You purists, I SWEAR. The most annoying type of people we have to deal with leading up into Classic.

This would work for the home page, but even if you log out of everything and delete all your cookies, you're still going to see generally popular content related to the video you just watched. Like if you watch a WoW video you will still be recommended generally popular WoW content on the video page and at the end of the video, which will probably include popular WoW streamers.

You're probably better off trying to [teach the algorithm](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bu5iw2/just_fyi_you_can_filter_streamers_from_your/ep7uhm5/) what you do and don't like with the "not interested" button.

Is a problem for me
---
I guess I didn‚Äôt really have a noob tank moment since I rolled warrior specifically to tank. Big oof was me speccing into prot to level.
---
Yeah, I'm going to try and just enjoy the ride Haha.

Looks like the original website no longer exists, but here's a blog post from TBC. It started up mid 2005.
---
https://www.engadget.com/2008/07/16/15-minutes-of-fame-more-than-mere-leftovers/
---
What rumor? That mount vendor shows up only once per year for 10 minutes. I camped that thing for literally months, 18+ hours a day. I earned that mount
---
Well if, to your point, you're running in to the middle of a group then the extra point in Grim Reach literally does nothing?
---
Actually both of those points do nothing? Being able to throw a few CoEs on melee targets would be much better than a CoA, right? 
---
I get that it's situational, but I feel like CoE has way more potential power than the range on affliction spells. 
---
Both are good, CoE might result in some saves, increased range definitely means better overall damage over time since you've got some extra range to dot folks.
---
Mocking blow is a taunt.  
---
Revenge is a tanking ability that is low fury cost and high threat instant attack.
---
Rend is mostly used in duels against rogues/druids to keep them from stealthing.
---
Slam is used by 2h fury warriors on Alliance side in their PvE rotations.  (It's good dps with a 2h but you have to use it right after an auto otherwise you lose dps because it resets your swing timer).
---
- It wasn't possible to see enemy name plates for 100y
---
- It wasn't possible to track debuffs on enemy name plates
---
- Range detection on raid frames in 1.12 clients is only possible via an API loophole, it's unintended behavior
---
That makes sense. Would it be possible for Blizzard to ban such channels if the toxicity is too much?
---
To be honest, I'm actually fine with instances like this.
---
It allows me being a shaman to dps while my 3 warriors friends WF everything to death. No one has to tank until a boss. Win win.
---
Yeah I remember hunting Sleeve and Pantleg down. And this guy named Sandisk that used to troll in Stormwind all the time.
---
Hi, i would like to introduce Bourbon Raiders. We are a casual, family-oriented guild. We do plant to complete all endgame content, but at our own pace. Our website is: bourbonraiders.guildlaunch.com.
---
You can reach me on discord: Algammon#1375, ot my battletag: Breakout#1905.
---
Female with the twin braids so they swirl when you cast.
---
I played vanilla, but never really got into a raiding guild. I've never had a lot of time to devote to games, I've always had to juggle work, school, and family.
---
Check out the game Outward
---
Been fulfilling the itch for me lately.
---
**Buy your Curses**
---
A lot of leveling guides will tell you not to buy any of your curses (save for CoA), in order to save money, but if you plan on doing dungeons then you are gimping yourself by not buying your curses. Warlocks are valued for their utility more than their DPS. If you do not buy your curses then you are abandoning your utility.
---
* CoT slows down casting speed (great for casting on healers) and that can "save" more dps than CoA would have done, and gives a larger window for other classes to interrupt.
---
* CoR Makes target immune to fear (including running at low health) and reduces its armor while increasing its attack power slightly. Casting this on a runner can save your group from extra adds (or even a wipe). If your group is melee heavy then this can be better for overall DPS than CoA.
---
* CoW reduces the amount of damage that a mob does per hit. This can be huge on mobs that have fast attack speed, especially if you're healer is struggling.
---
Where‚Äôs Mankrik‚Äôs wife?

You're completely misinterpreting my post. I never said that there was anything wrong with ganking or that it made me angry.
---
You're brave
---
TIL retail wow shadow priests don't melt faces anymore. So sad
---
I was alliance on SR and was thinking the same.
---
I knew one, ONE dude who did r12 as a hunter in vanilla, and that was 2h before high school, race home after, play til 1am, and wake up at 5-6am to do it again the next day. Shit was insane. I was happy to have my Blood Guard.
---
I agree that it might break the immersion to some degree. It has given our characters the ability to log on azerothian 4G everywhere, lol
---
PvE servers don't have the awesome battles that arise from PvP servers. I'm simply offering another option for people who play on PvP servers but want to mix it up a little bit.
---
There will always be twinks bro. Always.

Good ol fashioned fun at Tarren Mill
---
Just collect gear for both sets, and just keep your shadow spec. Your healing won‚Äôt be as optimal as it could be, but you‚Äôll do fine for pve.
---
You could also just keep up shadow weaving if there‚Äôs no other spriest in the group (basically like a PI/SW priest but without PI) and provide for the group.

You say that now, if you plan to pvp I bet that'll change real quick
---
You don't need bandages or food outside of the spirit buff in pserver. If you stack spirit you regen so much it's insane. If it's any improvement in classic it probably won't be that far behind the other classes while leveling.
---
Big fish eats little fish
---
The trick I found on pservers was to always do green quests. Same exp but they're significantly easier to do as a solo warrior. Leveling isn't so bad when you're 2-4 levels over the mobs you're fighting. 
---
I personally do **all** of the starting zones. 
---
Elwynn &gt; Dun Morogh &gt; Teldrassil &gt; Westfall &gt; Wetlands &gt; Darkshore, and so on.
---
It's never really that seamless though, ofc. There's a lot of traveling and back and forth to ensure you're only doing greens and dont let anything turn grey, but it's great for reputation farming, and you can easily chain pull mobs.
---
If they put unarmored mounts in then they should stay in. There is no reason that they should only be available to poop-socking jobless basement dwellers that can grind 1,000 gold in the first month.

 **Guild Name and location**
---
&lt;Guide&gt; - EU PvP Server- Alliance
---
**Language**
---
**Guild Type**
---
Hardcore PvE Guild, with mandatory PvP Events
---
**The Philosophy**
---
We're a guild where the leadership have experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive.
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, with the goal of realm first and fastest, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we mainly need to recruit people.
---
**What we expect of you**
---
We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. We expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay and are able to research stuff yourself, in order to improve your gameplay. However, we‚Äôre always here to help you improve.
---
We also expect you to participate in events, held by the Guild during the time we wait for a release, on our very own Test Server. We expect that when you chose to apply for this guild, you will show dedication towards it, even prior to Classic release.
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule** (GMT+1)
---
Wednesdays 18-23
---
Thursdays 18-23
---
Mondays 18-23
---
Obviously we don‚Äôt expect to need all of the raid days to clear the content in the early stages. Most likely only one or two might be used. But when we start needing more days, these are most likely the times.
---
During new content release we expect to raid when servers open up
---
You can find more information over on our Discord, or by PM‚Äôing me or an officer from the guild. We hope we caught your interest and that you're up for the challenge!
---

---
Nice dude! This has helped me so much. One of the best posts on this sub imo.
---
In the battle.net client, check the drop down menu over the install/play button in the WoW tab, there you can see your account, PTR and if you have beta it will say something like "Classic beta and stress test".
---
played vanilla through BC, got perma banned just before raiding started and blizzard DGAF back then, no backsies. 
---
started over, didnt catch up with my guild sadly. kept playing hard through WOTLK and then petered out.
---
Promising it right now:  
---
Every ret pally who crosses my path while leveling, WILL get a free healthstone.
---
I may be a demon-summoning maniac with zero use for the holy light, but goddamn, you gotta admire these glorious bastards =)
---
One whole talent point to spend. What will we do with all this power?
---
Curious, how did it "take you time to remember" that your guild was one of the top guilds? Surely that'd be something you'd just know and not go "oh yeah I forgot we were pretty darn high up". That's like paragon going "oh yeah, we did get a few world firsts eh? I forgot!"
---
Even if the chance were 1% (I think it was lower in Vanilla), you're looking at ~69 runs just to see it, and then you have to win it.  Good luck.
---
Edit: Oh, I thought you said "any raptor mount", didn't realize you said the **ZG** mount.  Yeah, you're right.  I did ZG almost every cooldown during Vanilla and only saw the raptor/tiger a handful of times (like 3 or 4 total).
---
I would want compaion and mount tabs, instead of them taking bag space I could collect them without feeling wasteful :)
---
Warrior is not only the slowest, it is slowest by a landslide.  
---
Anyone who played back then will say the absolute same thing.  Warriors would look at one another and understand the true pain they went through to hit 60... it was a brotherhood no other class could possibly take part in.
---
It wouldn't be be very exclusive if everyone can get it again, right?
---
Yes, and sadly, once BG's come, wPvP activity will basically be cut in half or more.   
---
 It's something that a lot of people don't talk about either.  The cumulative effect that organized PvP has on wPvP, and especially since there's zero wPvP mechanisms like capturable bases/more honor per kill in world pvp, it give players only reasons to do BG's instead.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
For the first point I don't really remember the range on nameplates for sure but I did always play with them enabled and can tell you that you could always see them through objects and easily tell opposing faction members were hiding.
---
For point two you could definitely do this in vanilla. I have no proof other than my own knowledge from raiding all through vanilla and playing with an addon that improved upon the nameplates to include debuffs.
---
Point three was also something you could definitely do in vanilla via addons.
---
Inb4 100% yes
---
Not only did it do everything you said, but it also killed wPvP alongside of BG's.
---
unarmored pets were part of the vanilla experience, they should be treated in the same way as CE pets
---
Thanks man!  I'm glad to hear that people are finding it useful.
---
Sounds silly why they would interfere. Just leave any channels you don't like or report people that are saying shit that's against ToS.
---
Hmm, that is an interesting idea but will be literally aids on launch.
---
Winamp, it really whips the llama's ass.
---
you've come so far
---
Play HOTW 0/30/21, does both decently enough
---
Average time at the end of vanilla was 11-12 days.  So 260-300ish hours, and people knew what they were doing by that point.
---
&gt;was to cold blood ambush
---
So you value going further in ass over sub? I have seen so many conflicting opinions on which tree is superior for pvp. Would you mind making that 31/8/12 spec idea in a classic db talent sim? I just want to bookmark the page and compare it to others I have seen lol.
---
Your logic is very narrow. 
---
They can add raids, dungeons, without removing, merging, condensing.
---
This sounds like something Id be cool with. I have other offers on the table though, so Ill get back to you beforehand.
---
Revenge is one of your primary tank spells, it does great threat for very little rage. Requires you to block but that you do often. 
---
Mocking blow is just an extra taunt in case of resist. and yes taunt resist happens.. way too often.
---
Rend is really good dps early game as arms, it gets worse and worse over time, and at 60 it's only used on rogues in pvp to prevent stealth. 
---
Slam is a very niece ability, after using it you have to wait your full attack time, so you have to use it right after attacks to minimize downtime. There are some 2hand fury specs that uses slam occasionally in raids. Lastly it can be used in pvp if you intercept with massive amounts of rage and want to burst you auto mortalstrike slam for oneshot
---
What? He died IRL?
---
Yeah, I'm worried about that too lol. I've never had the opportunity to be apart of a launch but I've heard questing in general is nearly impossible. I'm seriously considering waiting a week or two if things are bad. I'm in no rush.
---
If you are in no hurry, there is no reason to NOT play on launch. Sure, everything will take longer but you arent in a rush so
---
Prot Paladins and Ret paladins are same brain draining, extra effort, annoyances yea heh.
---
Dawn of War was so awesome!
---
Have you ever taken a 70mg vyvanse?
---
I wont get AQ40 quest mount and i wont go for wintersaber mount either. This is the only "exclusive" mount id have a chance on, not that ill stress out my lvling to get it but it's sad to see content cut from the game. I thought "no-changes" was their moto :(
---
Started in 2.3. I am excited to play the one version of WoW I never got a chance to.
---
Guild Bank
---
I will never not be traumatized over trading in my ivory raptor for an armored raptor
---
warlocks and frost mages.
---
You mean to say that people don't perfectly remember how much damage enemies did 15 years ago, and that their experience on private servers isn't accurate because the majority of numbers on there are spitballs because they don't have exact values? Impossible!
---
Haha true but I'm not sure I want to deal with spawn camping wolves as a warrior. Well see, the excitement may keep me going.
---
I'd be down for dual spec, but It must have the original cost.  It will be something only very few people will aspire for.
---
Should AQ40 quest mount be removed from game or given to everyone aswell? since you have to be a "poop-socking jobless basement dweller" to get it?
---
You still kinda sorta had wPVP in TBC, though not nearly to the same extent as Vanilla, and then Wrath was the final nail in the coffin. Flying mounts and the reduced need to go out in the world and do things were the real killers; wPVP was pumping in Isle of Quel'Danas in the Sunwell era. During downtime before I got into the Wrath beta, I'd go Hemo spec and spend hours destroying kids with my 4pc T6/4pc S4 dual Warglaive rogue.
---
Amen brother
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure its a blue sword, but if you get both swords from ZF you can combine the two 1h‚Äôs into a 2h epic
---
You don't even need to tank anything except some last bosses, its that easy. xD   
---
unless very underleveled/geared
---
Hence the "". Blizzard removes it because it is a timed exclusive if you follow vanilla, if done right it would be removed at the latest on phase 3.
---
The argument brought up already in this thread is immersion. When everyone has the ability to join the worldchat from everywhere, tradechat and generalchat becomes obsolete. This in turn makes the feeling of being lost in a deep forest weakened - since you can always tap into the globalchat and see the wall of text.
---
I don't want a beta key, but I AM excited about classic.
---
I'm giving myself now until classic release to beat some games I havent yet beat.
---
-Red Dead Redemption 2
---
- God of War
---
-Horizon Zero Dawn
---
Finished Spiderman and hopefully I'll get through at least two of these before then.
---
Stick to retail
---
The funny thing is that this isn't taking into account PvP servers... the amount of random crap that is going to happen to you is going to slow you down massively.  
---
And if you try to rush in the beginning.. keep in mind you are going to be competing with mobs for at least a week or so beyond what is acceptable.  Being ganked and camped is going to cost you many, many hours.  
---
Average time to level near the end of vanilla was 10-12 days depending on class.  World record was around 125 hours or so by someone who planned a route and practiced it.  Yea, this thing isn't really that off.
---
Agree. Phase 3 would probably be more correct, i think it was patch 1.4 they were deleted? I could for sure go along with P4 or have them in for all of vanilla really. More vanilla content the better.
---
NE Priestess is best for A E S T H E T I C and I am 100% about that life.
---
I played towards the end, but I never hit 60 because I constantly rerolled and made level 19 twinks. Excited to do the end game this time
---
Elem shaman ?  Started at TBC and Im thinking in playing shaman, how does it feel playing one ?
---
Braindead and strong and easy - rogue. 
---
Just strong, "feel good", straight forward in the gameplay and least gear dependent - mage.
---
I understand. I too would enjoy a PvP server where the players were sporting and honorable. You run across one every now and then, but for every honorable player there are a dozen that don't care. It's an uphill battle and every day there are fresh faces that just want to stomp lowbies for the luls. In general the demographic that choose PvP servers now is very different from 14-20 years ago.
---
There are still massive battles on PvE servers. The difference is that you can opt out if you choose to.
---
