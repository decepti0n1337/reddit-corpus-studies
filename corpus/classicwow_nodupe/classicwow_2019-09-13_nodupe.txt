You can skip those tho. When facing those slab you can follow the wall on your left to skip them and also skip a few mob

I remember a ton of level 60's duking it out in Hillsbrad.  Often it was lower level toons that started it, but someone would call in a guild, and another guild and suddenly there was 50 vs 50 (or more)...  Pure carnaige.
---

---
I remember simialr Guild v Guild or just massive battles in Felwood...  Or raids battling outside of Onyxia.
---
I had somewhat of the same experience few days into my classic experience. I (a at that time lv 12 Druid) ran through Crossroad in The Barrens when I saw a mage and warlock trying to sum a friend of theirs. I noticed that they couldn’t summon him since they only were 2 people so I ran up and tried to press on it, I wasn’t in party with them so I couldn’t help. The warlock asks me, after seeing this, if I can help them summon their mate. After I’d helped them he traded me 1 gold (keep in mind, I was lv 12 so a gold was quite a lot for me). God I love the classic community.
---
Fuck that quest and the griefing that comes with it
---
I don't think the vast majority of them are consumed. could very well be wrong though. I was only ever gnomish.
---
Never ever let anyone tell you you made a mistake making your character. Play what you want, dont sweat it, fuck the haters and have fun.
---
I like that, mount at a flight path, when you land and dismount your mount flies back to the ‘stable’ which is just any of the flight paths
---
I have zero knowledge about shares but you would only make money selling them not owning them, right?
---
Great!

Classic +
---
The Horde treat their brothers-in-arm with respect. The days of petty disagreements that fuel hatred is what the Alliance represent. Us Horde brothers treat everyone with encouragement and honor. I would gladly fight by your side to conquer a dungeon as one.

I usually sell a portal for the cost of reagent to a friendly and polite low lvl player and 50s to 1g for everyone else (except guild mates). So be nice and you might end up with a cheap portal from your friendly neighborhood mage.
---
but AV is so far away. like a year right?
---
They are all over populated so it’s really hard. You will make more farming SM in a speed run or just doing quests still as those yield the most gold.
---
2080 Super checking in, aint this the truth.
---
Classic+ is just flat out not happening.  As it is right now this little project is just printing them money and they don't have to put too much development time into it.  Making it insanely profitable.  Classic+ while awesome in theory would require a LOT of work and thus money to pull off.  Classic resetting would make it so the population falls off a cliff eventually.  Player retention would be ass.
---
Classic expansions seems like the logical way to go.  While everyone has their opinion on what peak WoW was it does seem to be widely accepted that up to wotlk was WoW at it's best.  I think if they released TBC and WOTLK it would be very well received and the populations would likely even grow quite a bit.  I personally know quite a few people who would drop everything and come back to WoW if they get to WOTLK.

don't say thank you, just use that fucking buff. nobody who drive-by buffs is doing it for the thanks

Yeah, that sounds right.

Only if they have experience with portals and are paying attention.

It works most of the time when dealing with assholes, as they frequently fail to pay attention.

That’s their prerogative and their choice way to level but they got to come out eventually, and don’t forget the end game when the grind to 60 is done.
---
Middle and right columns, why not have both
---
If you take gear from someone who can equip it as an upgrade its a ninja.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The fact that you profit off of it is immaterial especially since anything sub-60 is going to be replaced eventually anyways. 
---
I mean again there's a reason Blizzard eventually got rid of the ability to do this.
---
It was actually the only physical backup of the game they had and they weren’t even sure if it would work when they loaded it up.
---
Use the downvote button. Sorted.

Retail has a relatively good community as long as you're not apart of content you're not prepared for. Classic doesn't have timers that need to be beat etc. 
---
I think a lot of people look down on the "toxicity" of retail but haven't experienced much of the content outside of things they may have been ill prepared for. I hardly ever get flamed on retail unless its just a single bad apple.
---
This whole thread triggered me
---
Reported both of you guys to Blizzard
---
The other complaint is that it makes dungeon grinding way too easy, so players end up preferring to stay in the city hubs instead of exploring the world.
---
This is more of a personal preference thing but most of the classic crowd love the fact that the zones are bristling with players doing group quests together and interacting is ways that had been lost in retail.
---
I agree. Why would I want their server if it's also my server? Makes no sense.
---
lmao
---
What la the instance rest per hour? Been so long I forget
---
How did I miss these the first time 😂
---
True, alliance also go there at a higher level but still even in Desolace I see 3 alliance for every horde, I'm not complaining I like world pvp even when I get stomped but I'm honestly surprised is all i thought it would be the other way around I'll see how Tanaris is I'll be heading there soon
---
Holy shit, how old are you guys? I didn’t recognize this and have never heard the song. Google told me it’s from a song that was recorded in 1955. White monster targeted ads must be through the roof on this sub.
---
I am fine with new content. Because if they leave it as is unchanged, then it will go stagnant fast. The thing I don't like is the direction they took the game, mostly after BC, so if they can find some way to add in later content, but keep much of the mechanics as they are now, then I think that will be fine for me. Keep the spirit of classic wow as best as possible.
---
Creating classic servers for every expansion is a bad idea. You don't want to segment your playerbase into so many different games. Not to mention the difficulty in having to maintain so many different titles at once. Classic+ is likely not going to be what everyone thinks it is. I mean that's really all retail is. It's just more and more additions to the base game. Classic+ would in theory be nice, but is only possible by completely changing Blizzard's design philosophy. And if we are just completely retraining blizzard to create content then why wouldn't they just implement those ideas into retail? The reason classic is so good is because all it does is copy the formula that was set before them. If you asked Blizzard to make new content all you would get is more BFA thinking but with a classic skin.
---
You're super lame, not everyone wants to advertise it
---
Polling genuinely seems like the best option to me, as forking the game version every few years going to cause problems. Another option is just fixing retail. I don't love BC for it's content, but more so it's systems.
---
I bought call options that expire the week after the November earnings report.  Keep in mind the financial quarter being reported ends September 30th, I believe, so that is 2 months worth of subscriptions.  As long as the momentum for Classic persists, the January earnings report is going to be insane, since that will include the sales for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which I think will do quite well.

Is there a command to show me fps? I don't actually know what its running at. I don't see any tearing or stuttering though.

This may sound stupid, but it makes finding a group so easy that it ruins the experience.  Downtime is what makes the game social.  If you can just queue up, get in the dungeon in two minutes, do it, drop and find another group, there's no social time.  Also it makes community important.  Finding a group is hard. You don't want to then get a terrible group on top of that and then have the dungeon take forever or not be able to do it.  Finding good friends and having a good guild becomes important.  I ran so many dungeons in retail where it felt I was just playing with bots.  It's so automated and easy.
---
I'm not completely against a LFG tool, but I'd rather see a more bulletin board style where you post it you're LFG or LFM and still had to message people first.
---
LFR is a whole other topic. That's basically cancer.  It negates a big reason to have a guild.  It's so easy to find a group that after one wipe, half the raid leaves and just joins another.
---
I, for one, would love to see it progress to, and stop, at WotLK.
---
Warriors are slow bloomers.
---
You can try targeting specific equip slots, like /equip slot 16 [name of weapon]
---
Aren’t all classic dungeons just tank and spank?
---
I don't understand how that's any surprise, most polls were showing like 20% warriors or more sometimes
---
Definitely not True Classic. WTF reset my progress? I'm a working man, I don't have time for that shit.
---
Ye
---
I'm not a boxer and don't think it should be allowed but you really can't see how that'd be fun?
---
As a full time Dwarven Priest.  I let DPS die anytime they purposely pull aggro.  We still got 2 more DPS.  We are more likely to wipe if I have to spread around my heals running me OOM then letting them die and continuing on healing the tank.
---
Hahha I know right, but horde are in a much better position for it since their town hub is right next to it,
---
I griefed one guy, purely because him and a druid griefed me a few times
---
That was me the other day in STV grinding panthers. Took me a few clicks to realize it was a NE in car form. Oops.

#Classic+ and Expansions
---
If only there was a way to give ninja's an easy 200-300g literally every time.
---
Having rez sickness now increases your aggro radius by 5 times.
---
I think tokens actually make them even more money. Don't they cost $20 or am I not remembering that correctly?
---
Last night I was killing Bloodsail Buccs and it was just me (UD Rogue) and an Alliance (NE Hunter).  We took turns pulling mobs and helping each other kill.  It was probably the most wholesome thing to have happened to me on a PvP server.
---
Oh no, I can't melee kite like I could on private servers.  And I'll claim that I could on vanilla, even though I never played then and have no idea what vanilla was even like.
---
Your argument is pointless.
---
Warriors and rogues in just easily farmable pre-bis should outdo mages.
---
It only gets worse when they get raid weapon upgrades.
---
They added this shit because every single WoW player in the world all had to share the same game client.
---
Now that WoW is forked, the devs have full license to never add anything that's MMO-breaking back into WoW Classic, because now the answer is simple...if you want that stuff, they have Retail for you.
---
I have full faith in Classic+ purely because of Retail existing and able to shoulder all of the complaints.
---
I do actually, that's why the quote you chose said "to me". Stop being a troll and go back to bed.
---
What method/addon for your HP/MP bar?
---
Blizzard taking players votes into account? Now you’re being too fantastical
---
This guy stunlocked before diminishing returns in vanilla.

I smell jealous of who makes 20k xp / h
---
I have the same problem with my steam library.  It keeps growing faster than I can play it.
---
The thing is you don't even know they are shit heads once you group up with them. Yesterday i got yelled at by a warlock cause i rolled need for a dagger that was a straight upgrade for me. After i told him that he said my gear is shit (not rolling for gear would surely help) and went on to say he's not playing with cowards, then kicked me. That made so little sense to me i am still shocked. 30 minutes later i finished the dungeon with another group and the guy was still spaming the lfg chat.

I’d say you can comfortably start at around late 20s, or 30.

theres been at least 4 people who commented the same

also i edited my comment to explain that.

but hey, thanks i guess
---
Man that dude just death star'd you!
---
this was the last patch before wrath, but technically true
---
MegaTransactions, or trillions of uTX
---
You can and many of us do. Problem is if I advertise LFM SM Cath spellcleave I'll get a full party in 10 minutes, if I advertise LFM SM Cath I'll immediately get mage whispers, then when I invite a rogue dps the mages leave and it ends up taking 30-40 minutes to find a group.
---
It's not that we can't do that, it's that for some reason people don't like doing dungeons for fun and prefer to just AOE them down and flat out won't volunteer for it any other way. Finding a group for SM as a hunter takes 3-4x longer than it does as a mage.
---
Anecdotally, it's not a significant difference.
---
Cool and?

man i cant decide between tukui or elvui. I already got used to elvui but this has such a nice feel. Elvui feels kinda fake modern cheap plastic. but it works so well
---
Lots of sensitive people use reddit as it's sort of a 'safe space' where you can't be mean to other users without getting your post removed. Works flawlessly if you want people to kiss your ass, but it's horrible for discussion so you get nothing but posts like these that are 'helpful' even though they're obvious.
---
I love WotLK. That was when I really was able to get into the game. First time I was able to do endgame content. With that being said, I LOVE the idea of Classic+.
---
It's not really a thing in classic though, with 1.12 talents. I really liked the old survival tree, dancing in and out skirmisher playstyle.
---
This, and make sure mobs are at least, or perhaps also at most, 4 levels above him to maximise EXP earned. I don't think 5+ levels above earn much, or any, more EXP.
---
I’m sure they were around, do you remember the name?
---
True. Fuck alliance.
---
I don't think we know
---
Roach?
---
Okay thanks I’ll try that. So it would have to be in the action bar technically then? Or are you talking about an equip spot in your bag?
---
I always wanted Wrath servers more than vanilla servers anyway
---
I think “classic” should mean pre-cata.
---
Maybe update the graphics
---
They could add a few hard to do quests at the top end that give you an extra 2-3 talent points too which would be pretty cool. Theres tons of things they could do that makes it feels like an expansion without going near the abomination of the old retail expansion timeline. Avoid anything that touches level cap or raises stats to crazy levels.
---
Salt.
---
Yeah, I watched alpha game play of it on Fevir's YT I think. Reminds me of EQ and Vanguard more than WoW. Rightfully so because it's Brad McQuaid's baby right? I'll give it a go, Vanguard was kinda cool just a bit of an uneven experience.
---
Yeah I almost never take more than 3-4 hits unless I'm taking 1 mob while VW takes 1-3 more
---
Correcting something to work as intended isn't a nerf anymore than fixing a world quest to make it not repeatable every 2 or 3 minutes. The threat generated was not inline with the "no changes" mentality of classic. It sucks it really does (I'm speaking ad a warrior that likes to tank and plans to at 60) but you cant have the classic experience while looking the other way on things like this.
---
As a prot warrior while leveling, I appreciate this very much.
---
BC release and then classic+, I loved wrath except fuck deathknights
---
Due to that logic I can need on every single boe with no frustration with anyone else I'm running with. All I'm saying is if you expect the entire community to follow your rules. They better be real fucking simple and explainable lol.
---
I really dont trust the WoW community, I bet with a vote system we would have flying, dungeon finder etc. in no time.
---
Gimme classic plus. New content in line with the old rpg feel.
---
I.e.: Raids that require, say, nature resistance. Fighting against storm elementals or storm giants, clouds and mountains and shit.
---
Classic isn't hard, its the soul and feel want.
---
I have /cheer and I use it everytime I see a fellow druid before jumping around them
---
I have no dog in this fight. But after your claim, the burden of proof is on you. Diablo 2 is still my second favorite game of all time, if that matters.
---
Classic+ maybe, def not reset servers and characters.
---
Not even a month in and this subs tone is a farcry from \#nochanges that dominated the overwhelming majority.
---
I'd like to see a combination of Classic+ and Classic Expansions with all the best aspects of the original expansions cherry-picked and incorporated into new content.
---
Name conflicts, guild name conflicts, etc... not gunna happ
---
As someone who never played retail WoW, but played a lot of OSRS, I would like to see a blend between Classic+ and Classic Expansions.
---
I like a lot of the lore, and the added races, but I don't know anything about the gameplay from the expansions, so I can't fully endorse them. Maybe make changes to what people see as the problems those expansions caused, implement only parts of them, or something along those lines. Mix that with new and unique content for Classic specifically, and I think you have a recipe for the same kind of success OSRS has seen, without the playerbase holding it back with asinine vote systems.
---
Thanks a ton! started skinning and leather working
---
The holy talent tree has healing bonuses. It's a healing specialisation.
---
Most players are casual and don't know the best spots to grind for gold. I'm almost 40 and have a long long way to go for the 100g.
---
I stood by the escort quest in Darkshore /yelling about LFM. Suddenly a really high level mage came along with his low level friend and started the escort without me. I asked him to invite me but he just laughed at me so I suicided to mass pull and kill his escort for the next 40 minutes. Screw you buddy!

He wants to milk you.

Have you not been playing the last 3 weeks? people are still in a phase where they are helping others out, not trying to take advantage. Odds are that the person would gladly trade the boe instead of saving it for money.
---
I'm not familiar with the hunter class quests, but have you tried reloading your ui?
---
And some m+'s pls.

it fun.
---
Since getting into the habit of pickpocketing humanoids i've had so much flash/blind powder it's crazy.
---
Using this 1:67 ratio you could probably get a rough estimate as to how many could realistically afford a thousand dollars a month on micro-transactions (i know that isn't actually feasible but periodicity for 1 has to match periodicity for 67 for argument's sake) to how many could not afford it and use that ratio and compare to 1:67 for validation (my first guess is that the 67 number is more like a few thousand lol). Maybe restrict to lower middle to upper middle class cause that's gotta be most of userbase. I honestly think that could literally solve the argument that everyone seems to be having in this post.
---
There's obviously an infinite number of parameters not being considered when comparing average working US citizen to WoW player, but it would for sure be a better base than I've seen on anywhere on this post. Unless I just haven't stumbled on someone to finally comment factual information yet.
---
If you think things are fine the way they are, conservatism, i think that's ignoring out of control fires. The 2 party system is retarded.
---
Typically the proper etiquette is to roll on the chest in advance, HOWEVER if an item that people actually need drops, you give it to whoever needs it (or roll if multiple) because obviously need over greed. 
---
There is more to a chest than greens and rolling after is just silly.
---
Wow all these people saying option 2 sure have a lot of faith that these programmers that were hired to port an old client and fix bugs can somehow create brand new content while staying true the spirit of Vanilla WoW.
---
Let's be realistic here. If new content is going to be created, who is going to make it? They won't be knocking on Kevin Jordan's door. It will be the same team already making BFA content.
---
And when Activition has creative control over what new content gets put in WoW Classic, it's quite naive to think they won't try to monetize the shit out of it like every other game they make.
---
I'd take F R E S H every year or two over that any day.
---
My dude, I made no claim.  None.  Read user names.
---
Feral druid at 40 when you get direbear form could probably do it
---
Was that the joke this whole time god damnit
---
Yeah I think the most popular release would have been 2009, they indeed went with the oldest they could, and quickly added the popular updates from 2007-2011.
---
Since then they have released new content as per classic+ and I believe that is the best approach. Personally I’d love wotlk but I know everyone has their own favs
---
Considering some of the extreme queue times I'd imagine players would end up looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger by the time they hit level 60 if they did this.
---
Id love arenas with classic, or slow updates up to WOTLK
---
You absolutely should go into ass. Especially when other players are involved.
---
LOL. What server is this? I'm coming over
---
Ironically being an annoying dumbass is hardly distinguishable from just being an annoying dumbass 
---
Prove me wrong
---
Sooo a flight path would work for all of those.
---
If you're responding to an ad in trade, tip or don't tip. If you're asking in trade, that person is stopping what they're doing to craft something for you, you tip them for their time. How much is up to you. 1s per bag is quite reasonable, but honestly it doesn't hurt to ask the crafter.
---
It's one of the biggest root causes of everything going downhill
---
Buy him a server blade.

---
Yeah most players would probably say they wished it would have been around nex release not 07. 
---
Me personally that's why I stuck with rs3 I just couldn't go back to the outdated graphics and the boring old cb system. And I'm glad I did tbh I dont like what they have done with osrs, it looks like a private server. 
---
For me, I hope wow eventually at least releases bc, because I never played it.
---
Yeah you say to me, and then go on to try and state that the right way to play is your way.
---
If someone needs a boe blue and everyone else rolls greed, and they don't actually need it, ask for a roll and it can be traded.
---
I played since the first beta wave, I know.  And if you did you’d know how many people quit playing in those first months after release.  The original game was pretty bad.
---
Well, yeah I guess I get that, I mean why pick a Paladin if you want to be a healer? Is there anything Holy Paladins can do better than priests or druids?
---
Close guess but it was the graveyard. He didn't even roll need for it. He only wanted all of us to have an equal chance at vendoring the dagger i needed at that time.
---
There's an addon called classic census.
---
DR is the debil
---
If you have healing spells then you can heal, you don't have to change talents.
---
Classic+ for sure.
---
classic is for nerds, programmers are nerds. nerd power!

You're like a guy whining about other drivers when they get pulled over for speeding...

Just because it took you 45 minutes to do a 5 minute Photoshop job doesn't mean it's not low-effort...

Bad OP. Don't do that. Go to the gym at least a little bit! Don't wanna be losing those GAINZ

This is not true...if they have a healer yes

If you’re taking about locks (from your multiple use of dots), then they ain’t life tapping enough.

I'm saying okay, thats great. That doesn't mean druids are viable.

Many EU servers and several Na servers have queues like Pagle

I think there's about 3 posts like this a week on this sub alone - people have shitty infantile humour man.
---
Personal opinion that WoW was at its best in BC. WotLK was great up the new content after Ulduar. It they stopped at either Sunwell or Ulduar i'd be happy.
---
Just did loot the emerald one on Finkle (pvp FR).
---
Classic+
---
oh you
---
I hope you're as against classic as you seem to be because I'd love to not group with people like you.
---
I started playing 3 months after TBC launched, so that is my nostalgia. Of course leveling up through classic brings a lot of it back but TBC was really epic, more of a continuation of Vanilla than a game-changer like WotLK.

I did some grinding in Desolace/Badlands but questing anywhere is solid.
---
I also played the AH on the side
---
I had 93g at 40 as a rogue player. Just don't buy any levels of gouge/kick/feint/sap after the first level, forego your 36 - 40 skills (until after the mount), sell everything you don't need/use, do the quests for SM and do a few SM runs, and if you're alliance you can stealth Stocks for chests and the rare spawn pretty easily by about level 36. I made about 5g - 8g this way with about 1 hour sunk (20 minutes to do 5 runs each, spread out over a couple of days).
---
Okay, well it’s how they choose to play the game. Is that alright with you?
---
It's not really a new trend. It's just overall easier to track health and resources in the center rather than having to look up to the corner of the screen.
---
Yes, that’s very true. Almost every game client will be doing client-side prediction based on the last server snapshot, even for other players (sometimes why you see dudes running off in a line during a lag spike, or at least continuing the animation). Not having that prediction is just a bad user experience.
---
The important part of “client vs. server” is who is authoritative for a given decision- who makes the final decision about where you really are. This is why authoritative dedicated servers are preferred.  Plenty of things get left to the client if they don’t affect others, but things like position and when your spell lands all need to be server-side.
---
 
---
People used to complain in the original Gears of War because one player was a host, which has advantages even if you don’t purposefully exploit the situation. Your advantage over others is equal to their latency in that situation.

Asmon is so gross.

I feel you on this. If you could it as a group finder with your own realm and not teleport to the dungeon. I think it would be good.

Since mounts are bind on use couldnt a night elf character buy the mount, trade to you and then you just use the mount?
---
Classic+, i want to see new content fleshing out Classic completely before moving on to BC then Wrath. There were so many unused places that could be expanded, Azshara, Wetlands dragons, Hyjal, Titans, Bloodsail Buccaneers raid, Naga raid, New battlegrounds... So much more could be added to Classic that i dont want to just skip to BC like has been done
---
I sat in a queue on the first day, but not since then.
---
If they go the direction of adding Transmogrification to Classic (I am personally opposed to this) it should be available only to level 60 players, and the asshole in me would even go so far as to say it will only work with full named sets, or even exclusively tier sets.
---
But your only takeaway from this comment should be that it should only be available to level 60 players if they do decide to add it to Classic. The rest is just my own personal opinion and the devs will handle it as they see fit.
---
It was a leaked post from some foreign social media yeah, no confirmation on if its true from what I can find.

I hate this in particular because pull aggro is so important on low levels. If a DD pulls mobs you have to pluck every single one of them off.
---
High end speedrunning guilds will only bring holy paladins. 
---
They focus on spell crit and spam rank 1 flash of light to get fat crits and mana back. You never run out of mana this way and you never stop spamming.
---
I've tried reloading my ui yes
---
Damn, that's one ugly woman.
---
Some of the old school Mu Online pservers I've played back in the day would do "resets" for max level characters. Like you would beat the game essentially and then reset to level 1 with boosted stats. It provided a lot of replay-ability as some zones were overly difficult requiring a certain amount of resets. I wonder if Blizzard would ever get that creative!
---
Yes im at the orc trainer
---
Cant help but point out that they made goblins talk like jews and made them bankers.... that tied in with your comment makes me wonder.
---
Classic + Is a fucking dream!!! I really hope it happens.
---
I want to cross that Portal, kill Illidan then slay The Lich King someday... didn’t have the chance to play years ago. Having the opportunity to do it properly one day does puts a smile on my face.
---
Why the hell would you want gear score when it means literally nothing. Particularly in vanilla where some really solid gear is lower leveled?
---
Greedy company,you're delusional if you think they made classic for the love of the game.
---
Yes please!!
---
Classic + for sure.  
---
Add arenas, don't ever do flying, new zones and new content but fit it in to Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms. Keep older content relevant and make sure that world still feels alive. Make raids harder; perhaps introduce some retail boss mechanics. Balance classes.
---
I'm fairly certain they could figure it out.
---
That's not a cheeseburger walrus
---
Until the community starts forming cliques, becomes toxic and exclusive, and becomes smaller.
---
Budget mind control.
---
I think the end result is classic being a “pre-cata” version
---
I can't believe this has to be said, but also please work up your weapon skill *before* joining a group. Had this happen with tanks twice in two days now.
---
As someone who never played WoW until now, I'd love for Blizzard to release the next two expansions, but maybe altered to remove flying mounts and other largely negative additions. 
---
Idk if that's feasible or not, but I would like to play through that content.
---
Lmao mageweave* bad typo there sorry bout that
---
You have to train in Cat Riding. Which requires exalted.
---
Classic+, retrofitting following expansion content to the pillars that make classic great.
---
Would be an RPers dream. I could go down with some proper city exploration.
---
Client side verification is the worst kind of verification. 
---
It's again easily faked.
---
Level 44 and I've had no issues with Questie at all. The only time i had it bugging out not showing things on the map was when it was clashing with another addon that makes the quest log interface bigger. I can't remember the name of the addon but since I turned it off Questie has been working great. So I guess of your Questie is cooked, try turning off some other quest related addons.
---
I’d kill to play a belf in classic, my favorite starter zones
---
Classic+ because I strongly believe Classic Expansions will ultimately become a money grab because why wouldn’t you REBUY every expansion all the way up to... what?... MoP?
---
Having the access to the rest of the world while staying at 60 would be awesome and scaling would be easier with the new scaling system and timewalking
---
Because everyone in the group gets the same value out of a BoE drop. A person who can put it on doesn't need it more than anyone else.
---
Taunt makes the mob fight you and makes your threat equal to whoever is at the top. So, after taunt throw a sunder or two and you should be good.
---
Do something else, personally thats the issue I have with current WoW theres always a better piece of gear, getting your items should be it, if you mean m+ without better gear people wouldn't do it.
---
Out of all 4 day CDs, which one do you think would be the most valuable? Going to bring up some alts to 35 and not sure which profession to stack.
---
It's more of a piece of advice for speed and ease. Warriors don't do well on mobs that are orange or red in level above them because of hit chance. So grinding low yellow or green mobs just increases speed with less stops to eat and a higher TTK.
---
 If you want to grind it will only make your quests easier, and since the zones in wow classic don't always get you up to the next zones required level with quests alone, grinding is necessary.
---
Please don’t reset my character I would love to get thunderfury
---
Level 50 Class quests came with ZG patch, so they aren't in the game yet I believe.
---
I’m a level 49 priest, shadow specced for leveling, I’m wondering when I should switch to holy/disc for better healing in dungeons, and can I still deal good enough damage for questing? I like the idea of a disc/holy build that has decent damage as well as good healing potential.
---
Also, what ranks/types of healing should I prioritize? Currently using greater heal and sometimes flash heal in dungeons. But everything costs so much mana. I have a 4K pool but still feel like I’m running out fast when healing. Never really played a healer in wow, mostly dps in late vanilla and tbc
---
Yours in isolation is not spam like one spammer's email isn't. But the fact this shows up multiple times a day by others that make almost the exact same post about a Classic+ makes it spam.
---
I'm delusional? Who said anything about them making this "for the love of the game". Dude they totally made this to make money. I dont see what your comment has to do with any of this.
---
Plz no flying mounts 🙁
---
All depends on the group. Had a spell cleave that cleared cath in 32 min and were happy about it and immediately after another pug group cleared the whole thing in 4 pulls and 11 min (without the bosses) and were getting 61k xp/h. 
---
Basically, the average group will save you a little time if they are somewhat competent but when you get that god group there is nothing like it.
---
No new continents, but use assets already in the game to expand content. Very clear avenues are Karazhan and Caverns of Times.
---
That sounds like a solid plan, thank you!
---
Classic+  
---
Outlands before it was destroyed 
---
Alternate timeline Lich King
---
They did figure something out. It's in place right now and you've complained.
---
That wouldnt be too bad, but I am not against for it being able to be done anywhere. Travel is already a large part of the game and having to do it to just sign up and then travel to the dungeon would be a bit much. Idk. So long as they stay away from the dungeon finder that auto groups and install teleports you to the zone it probably wont be as toxic or as anti social as the retail version.
---
Yeah for sure. Having 5 people play efficiently is always harder than having 1 or 2 do it.
---
Classic is not about adding, or "re-adding", content that has already been delivered in expansions in Retail, it's about bringing back content previously removed or FUBAR'd to the point that said content wasn't worth playing anymore.
---
We don't want \_new\_ content, we want \_old\_ content back.
---
The players thought they were going to get a dungeon finder that would put them in a group, not teleport them to a dungeon. Most just wanted the already dungeon finder tool, but expected to be able to show that you wanted to run any dungeon and not just a select few. Strangely when the game came out the looking for group tool was completely open and you could even put you were looking for people to quest with but that wen away in a patch or so.
---
Its not an item for direct purchase, its a reward for a quest in westfall. The item you need to complete the quest is sold by Farmer Saldean. Special chicken feed is the item, and it costs only a few coppers.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3861
---
A corresponding horde chicken feed vendor was added at some point so the quest could be done with a chicken near Brill, but I don’t know if it is in Classic. 
---
A horde can do it in Westfall, if they have help getting the feed, or if someone else completes it causing the lootable egg to spawn.
---
I’m sure he’s referring to AoE grinding dungeons with 3 mages
---
As Alliance:
---
1. STV first nesinwary quests and the northern camp until quests turn red / orange
---
2. Hillsbrad foothills southshore quests
---
3. Desolace doing the first part (mostly northern quests)
---
4. Arathi highlands most of the quests bar the high level ones in stromgarde / sunken ships cove
---
5. Shimmering flats all quests (You should easily take 1 level atleast here from all the grinding)
---
6. STV continuation on trolls,  tiger raptor panther mastery part 2, venture co, etc 
---
7. Desolace SM questline (lvl 34 minimum) + kodo graveyard + Centaur grinding questline till you have to kill a boss which you should come back for later. Best to do this around LVL 36-37
---
8. Arathi highlands high level quests you skipped earlier LVL 37-38+
---
9. Dustwallow marsh all quests you can do LVL 38+
---
10. STV LVL 38-39+
---
The only the thing I miss from retail is being able to have multiple people tag named mobs (from same faction. I’d be down for option 2.
---
I’m only ever in the global channels if I need to be. I join lfg if I want a group. I only join general if guild chat is quiet. That varies on the zone though :) 
---
Making seperate tabs for different channels is good too.
---
Classic+.
---
Create better class balance (I.e. the only viable pally spec right now is Holy). 
---
No flying mounts.
---
No LFG.
---
No cross realm sharding nonsense.
---
Keep the game open world, player interaction, community oriented.
---
Have you tried 1. Turning your PC on and off
---
2. Repairing the files
---
3. Repeatedly slap the side of your pc till it stops making that strange noise and try again (maybe that's just my PC)
---
A nice thought for sure, but wouldn't he need to go to UC for sword training?
---
When I see a warrior obviously trying to level weapon skill I kill his mobs and pretend than I think that I'm helping him.
---
Easy, start your own group.
---
I’d be happy with any of the three. My preference is for Classic progression as long as people who enjoy classic can remain on classic realms.
---
Is there anyway to get the pages of chat to be all in 1?
---
My party and guild chat is on one pane, and local chat is on another tab
---
Komcrush!
---
I've been playing \~3-5 hours basically every day since release and my game has been running with 0 problems whatsoever. Starting yesterday, I began getting 5 sec freezes that occur every 30sec or so. I decided to download titanpanel to see if I could pinpoint the issue and that's when I saw this. Blizzard support was no help unfortunately.
---
It wasn't a whoosh. They understood your comment and responded with why it was dumb. And then you doubled down on being dumb.
---
Mate you nailed it this is exactly what sucks about BC
---
I'm a new player what's RP walking if I may ask?
---
I almost did this as a priest healer last night with wand/Shadow Word: Pain. Group all released and were worried they wouldn’t get credit though, so I suicided. Got her down all alive the 2nd time around though! 🤠
---
Definitely felt great though.
---
I agree with you completely. 100%
---
This is a fucking lie and it's clear you never played back then. Dungeon finder addons were never as ubiquotous as so many BFA kids who spout nonsense on this forum think it is. Nobody used them. Anybody who did still recruited using chat channels because the other 99% of the playerbase still did as well. Quit spreading lies. LFD happened after players bitched for it on the forums, and the devs were dumb enough to listen.
---
I mean their is a lot to explore, like making disc, demology and enhance true tank specs. Stuff that is already half finished in vanilla.
---
They just need to stay away from stuff that changes the core of a class. So for example giving locks teleport or gate would be a no go because it would go against the vanilla lock class fantasy of beeing a super slow turret caster.
---
thanks :)
---
This is so untrue
---
I would think people saying they want content is spam, while expressing interest in the story and listing out story. If you can find one post about the Wildhammer Dwarves and Dragonmaw's Orcs home Northeron I will personally delete the thread.
---
So you believe that the majority will fake it. And you believe that it's not at all possible to prevent the mass majority from faking their logins?
---
It is a tradition to make "the run" and it should not be given to the undeserving so freely!
---
Yeah that would probably keep me back in the game. But is also like to enjoy the nostalgia in tbc that i did when i was younger.
---
This has some big Verigan's Fist vibes.
---
What's generally the best poison setup for pvp and pve?
---
What are the mats for dreadsteed quest?  Mixed results online.
---
Warrior, mage and rogue are still by far the most popular it seems. Other than that yeah, some of the less played classes are seeing more play this time around. Warlocks in particular were very rare in original vanilla because they sucked for most of it, but we're on 1.12 where they got buffed and are actually pretty good.
---
That's the whole problem though, I'm looking/forming a dungeon group and people are just talking their asses off about unrelated stuff.
---
I create a separate window and only have the lfg channel assigned to it. There is also a classic lfg mod which monitors channels and publishes LFG adds in a separate window and if you select specific dungeons it will only alert you when those dungeons are advertised
---
Horde don't need to run anywhere or call anyone, we are just out in our world naturally. If the bad guys want to walk into us while we quest, so be it.
---
Imp till succubus for all leveling. Only use voidwalker for bossmobs or elites. Succubus after 30 can save your ass when you get ganked
---
I wish that was the case, on Mograine-EU it's all LFG
---
Yeah, but that's pretty excessive just to grab a mob. Using taunt liberally isnt a good idea. It's not good if taunt is on CD if you need it for something critical.
---
im totally for wow classic + but i don't want polls i trust the wow playerbase even less than blizzard activision you people are morons lmao
---
Not even close to true. Pick a class that isn't super gear dependent and run 5/10 mans, with the occasional PUG MC/Ony. When BGs come out you can grind Honor any time. If you only play sparingly this provides you with hundreds of hours/ months of progression.
---
Battlegrounds are not good for world pvp, wait for p3 when it ends in classic. Arenas satisfy a different function anyways as world pvp will never be competitive (or at least try to be).
---
OP you knew exactly what you were doing
---
There's no reason they shouldn't be able to tell the story of events that were happening in the world at the time of classic while not obliterating the current established lore.
---
I can agree with that
---
"poor guys"
---
Proceeds to melee cleave through the whole game
---
I saw 2 people in arathi questing and asked if I could join them and they told me no because they were “questing with their boy” and i was like... okay?? Lol
---
People don’t complain about the pvp.  People complain about the 5:1 ratio that is STVietnam.
---
What add on is that?  Is that the one that this sub went apeshit over a while back?
---
I love missing when I'm behind them or getting parried from a trogg when I'm behind them...some of this is just flat out stupid and annoying.
---
How do it get that’s info from titanpanel?
---
Ah okay gotcha
---
I think it makes you change direction, not movement. So if you are standing there it would just make you look where it was casted.
---
For anyone else looking to avoid a tough save up, get gathering professions first. Max the skills out and Sell everything on the auction house. Eventually just save up enough gold to buy all the mats you need for your desired professions and switch.
---
Probably rogues because then you can both stealth around. It opens up possibilities for skipping past mobs and surprise ganking in world PvP.
---
Like, your kinda right about PvP interaction but missing the point. It’s not completely dead with flying butany sort of interactions with other players are objectively less common with flying mounts. It’s an mmo
---
Alright, sorry to have bothered you.
---
ah kill two drwaves when i play video game....
---
You simultaneously bashed reagents and praised them?  Doing a quest and having something forever vs having to buy shit and take up inv space?  No contest.
---
GW has a cast time, cheetah doesn’t.  No contest. 
---
Walking on water vs. moving the same speed anywhere in the water?  No contest.
---
Rez is cool.  15 min hearth is cool.
---
&gt; while TBC was the only good expansion
---
I'mma stop you right there.
---
WOTLK is the GOAT expansion. BC can't even begin to touch it. Gaudy-ass gear and silly zones. Hard pass.
---
It wouldn't be reset, there'd just be new fresh realms
---
Sorting by new is asking to get garbage posts.
---
You'll want to grind out a couple levels by just killing stuff.  Probably Yeti cave in Hillsbrad is a decent bet.  At 32 you can push into Arathi
---
Shadowprey Village is still a decent hike to that graveyard though...
---
Just expansions. Maybe after BC they would consider a Classic + expac. The fanbase almost tore them apart over such little things on Classic. How could they be cooperative with a Classic +
---
There'd be plenty of people with 30K health at the end of wrath. Ultra geared tanks at least. Rare 40K's even. I didn't play cataclysm but are you sure 40K was the top end? Can't be right.
---
I like the ideas of classic+ and classic expansions. I’ve played on and off throughout all the expansions but really went ham in WotLK and Cata. I’d like to experience BC content being current content because a good friend of mine always tells me that BC was the best expansion. I’m having a ton of fun in classic and hope that maybe they’ll just redo everything and not mess it up lol
---
I mostly went 31/0/20 for Arcane Power + PoM still just spamming frostbolt. Do you suggest just going deep frost and dropping AP/PoM? If so do you have a talent tree link?
---
Alrighty, you spend 10 minutes every dungeon arguing in party chat about whether something is valuable or needed by someone, and I'll just roll with the rolls and ask if i can have or offer market value for if I want something in a whisper like a normal person.
---
You're dreaming. They put 15 years of hard work into content and progressing lore and story. They're not going to retrocon it. It makes no sense to diverge when they have expansions that were fucking massive lined up ready to go.
---
They need to have a manifesto of the objectives with Classic. If it's to retain the feeling of vanilla, you can do that with subsequent expansions by making changes. Flying mount only accessible areas? make flight paths. etc.
---
I don't envy them.. I don't REALLY think they've thought that far ahead.
---
I had a razer naga I used from wotlk till legion. Worked fine. Got rid of it when I quit and built a new pc and swapped to mostly fps games. 
---
Bought another razer naga with the 3 different sides you can put on it a few months ago when I got hyped for classic. Works just as good as the old one.
---
If you search around online you could find desirable greens (more realistically blues though). I think in general it's not worth stressing about minmaxing money out of greens as I'm fairly convinced people won't really be looking for the random enchant drops (and they aren't THAT uncommon) but may look for any notable items that make you go "wow" with their stat distribution (but again, mostly blues).
---
That said though, if you have the bag space don't knock grays. Weapons you never use and "useless" items from monsters can still add up. Doing killcount quests or roll x amount of items from y monster can fatten your wallet if you manage what's valuable and toss things that are less so.
---
Thanks. I'll test that out later
---
They should do what Jagex did with Old School Runescape. Poll new content on the old game and update quality of life things.
---
People are gona say  "but how will leveling work"
---
You don't need to add more levels. You can just keep adding new armor and weapons to the game.
---
Max combat in Runescape has been 126 for a very long time. But raiding and pvp content has been steady because of the new gear available
---
Also interested in knowing this. I don’t think my zoom goes out that far.
---
Make it so expacs happen regularly up to Lich King that is.  When they are released you have an choice.  You can either stay on your classic server, let's say Herod.  Or you can xfer for free to Herod BC, for free of course.  Then that expac can run it's course and eventually into Wrath, same choice happens.  To fix population issues be it for people that stay on older expacs or xfer to newer ones, just combine servers until optimum populations are reached.  Doubt this would be optimal from blizzards point of view having multiple expacs running at the same time.  This is just a way to give people choice.  If it was up to me, I would just do regular expac releases no choice just like it happened originally.
---
The consensus of my retail (horde) guild is that our main focus is now classic (alliance).  Everybody is happy with this change, although their were a few grumbles about the faction change.  Our off hour participation is 3x's the amount of people we normally see on a retail raid night.  
---
I don't see myself going back to retail any time soon.  May check out the 15 year anniversary content, but thats about it.
---
Not gnomes. Too spicy
---
Classic+, please.
---
I agree you don't need an addon, as managing energy gen is like keeping track of any other GCD in games, but being cognizant to not use all of your energy is important. Kicks/gouges are necessary at times - I save my healers a lot of mana in 3-4 target pulls in dungeons by kicking casters on cd.
---
My old twink was a warlock with a ton of shadow power gear. One dot could kill most people. I'd die, but I'd take 3 with me.
---
Classic+ is everything I want, I just don't trust the devs to do it correctly.
---
Technically no, imp is highest singe target dps, but succubus provides more utility, plus more constant damage due to not having cast times
---
Dps for high hp single target mobs
---
Succubus for general use and utility (especially on pvp servers)
---
Hotfix incoming. Why? Because it's too awesome.
---
" we’re not even a month into launch and everyone’s shitting the bed about where we go from here. "
---
exactly, ive predicted this back when i saw how many "guides" and info is being presented everywhere by everyone, its much easier to chew the content, addons like questie makes the game significantly less time consuming etc
---
I would go with 2. Seems way closer to Thrall than 3 in my opinion.
---
Option 3
---
i have another option.   all versions maintained.  when you are max level, you can choose to move on after beating the final boss.
---
I searched for it as I got home and found it in Chronicle 1 so it’s not in game lore per de but technically canon
---
Honestly, the first 2 expansions were some of the best video game content there has ever been. So I hope for 3rd option.
---
I mean they could just give those areas a different kind of gear progression.
---
Like for example lvl 60 wotlk content would force you to stack frost resistent because tons of mobs deal way to much frost damage without it. Or even the areas themself would put a frost dot on you that you need to negate with resistance gear.
---
I don’t and will never agree with you on that.
---
Classic+. The Blizzard I know is creative enough to pull it off.
---
What is the staff of westfall? I got the 2h hammer that looks like a marshmallow from the boss in DM, should I get this staff instead?
---
What's the advantage? I'd much rather fight a 5v5 against a multi-boxer than 5 co-ordinated players.
---
Nice.
---
Imagine. So sad.
---
These last two evenings I've been questing on my priest with a guildie druid and it has been great fun.
---
I went AFK for 30 secs, came back and he was dead. I laughed. His response: "Oh, I guess your heals were making a difference." &gt;. &lt;
---
Bring on Furor. :)
---
Classic+ is the only chance Horde will get to not have blood elves become a playable race.
---
No thanks.
---
Stranglethorn Vale is good, but also will be a bit crazy on a PvP server.
---
Arathi Highlands and Desolace are other options.
---
If it makes you feel better I had one try to chew me out because I wasn’t getting rid of the curse in there. 
---
He didn’t back down till about 5 minutes of the party telling him priests can not remove it
---
Classic + or expansions for sure
---
Is his fiancee just doing a baby girl voice or does she really talk like that?
---
I always use to run instant mainland deadly offhand in PvE. 
---
Instant main + crippling off for casual PVP.
---
Cripple main +wound off for tryhard PVP
---
That never really happened though. Nostalrius players kept their chars and were migrated to Elysium which then migrated to light's hope. Those who didn't play for those reasons were silly and missed out on the fun. They also didn't really reset realms, they added new ones and you could always go back to the other realm and look at your old stuff
---
I feel like if they tried to do "classic" for every expansion it'd get really expensive to run, so there'd have a to be significant demand for it. A lot of people loved the appeal of Classic so I can definitely see this being the case, but I feel like it'd be a bit less monumental than just returning to the Vanilla game. 
---
That said, from a personal standpoint I'd love to return to Wrath. I was eight when I played Wrath for the first time on my stepdad's (I'm 18 now and have my own!), and that was the version that made me fall in love with Azeroth for the first time. Just to see Darkshore again, the way it was before the Cataclysm, before the War of Thorns, when my Draenei hunter would run around Auberdine with her tallstrider... That'd be something special to me.
---
Last night i got my chicken companion. Clucked at a chicken and fed it feed to get it. Is my little buddy
---
As /u/F41LUR3 mentioned, you have an addon that is auto accepting party invites but not clearing the Invite frame.  
---
You joined the group and the party frames appeared while the Accept/Decline dialogue was still on screen.
---
Ohh well im sorry to hear that:(. I suggest to keep trying:)
---
classic+ would be the best option. Blizzard could continue making content with the vanilla game design philosophy and it would be fantastic.
---
I do use the addon myself, but have never really touched that part of it. My understanding is that performance monitoring collects and stores/caches data to your WoW directory. The "garbage collection" thing would be to discard/delete existing collected data so you can start fresh, like if existing data becomes corrupted for whatever reason and becomes unreliable as an analysis metric.
---
Dont forget enhance and discipline, both were half finished tank trees.
---
Mining is pretty scuffed at higher levels, spent about 4 hours mining in Burning Steppes and only got about 40 thorium ore and 20 dark iron ore, couple mithril while only seeing a couple other people in the zone who didnt seem to be farming. 
---
Spawn locations seem pretty accurate however.
---
Adding to this, do it while you're low level. Rep diminishes if you out level a quest (grey)
---
Couple of questions, TIA
---
1. Is it worth it to move off of a high pop server like Herod to Earthfury in the long run? I really want to raid classic and know that with lower pop realms it becomes a much harder thing to do, but I am getting DC'ed every single day now and thrown into a 3+ hour queue and I am unable to even play the game anymore
---
2. How long are the free transfers even open for? I saw a mention of it being the weekend, but it's day 8 now and it looks to me like they are still open
---
Lol, why do you assume I'm making assumptions? If you actually played on Nost or Elysium or LH, you don't have to question these things.
---
Actual SS of 3x damage:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cqczld/sm_library_damage_on_cloth_classic_vs_private/
---
Read the thread here (that was proven wrong cause Classic.db was using pserver numbers): https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br86ov/elite_damage_is_way_off_evidence/
---
Not true either, it was their only backup. they wanted to make pre-eoc servers but couldn't. if they wanted older, they were already running runescape classic.
---
I guess it kind of fit because of the private servers 2006scape/prs06 started and shut down only like 6 months before osrs came out.
---
i can't even get *one* level in a day without doing dungeon farm groups on my priest. why? because every quest zone is shock full of 5+ people contesting one single spawn. 
---
idk about you but i enjoy playing the game, not running around waiting 10+ min for one spawn. guess i don't have the spirit of classic in me.
---
This has to happen. People are already Pug clearing MC, they need to have more content down the road.
---
How it looks is secondary, as said by you. So that means gear is just stats. If it's the looks you're after, why should you replace your hard earned piece of gear with a green come next expac? The system is flawed but allows you to keep something you have an attachment to with you throughout the game's life, not just one xpac and be done with it.  
---
I think we could agree that to at least improve the system transmog should be expensive as fuck and only allowed if you've acquired the set in actual content, no transmog runs after the expansion is over would give you that look. That way there will be more incentive to do the dungeons and raids and rated pvp, and you'll be able to see who's the boss, and who's a pleb.
---
You're like adibas.
---
Personally I would like it to progress until Wrath. I want to kill the Lich King. I played since Vanilla until WOTLK. Thats nostalgia for me.
---
And Uldum, since there's a whole quest line in vanilla that teases it.
---
Classic + would be FUCKING incredible. I'm just sayin
---
Where the poll at?
---
You're from the Midwest aren't you?
---
What if it's a black person and that's just how they talk?
---
Had a guildie open all the doors while I was ina run with him. I still take the pee. Then I saw a group asking for a dps this week, so I thought go in with my lock who is sittting on level 25. It really made me smile when I saw the tank do it also.    
---
Credit to the group they managed to come back and clear them all.
---
Yeah that's what I was assuming for pvp. Either double cripple or cripple/wound, cripple/mind. Assuming since deadly takes a debuff slot, it's not really viable for raids?
---
Same -______-
---
I also want this one.
---
High level graphics, new features that are more immersive, add some creative depth (i.e. what if you could design your weapons as a blacksmith, clothing as a tailor, spells as a mage?).
---
Oh nice, that solves the lack of buttons problem then, it would be nice to be able to move the player/target frames and minimap as well.
---
"send me back"
---
True classic. Certain servers should rollback once a year.
---
I wouldn't be against a class of harder raids for the true no life challenge seekers. Make them Ragnaros Extreme, to take a page from the FFXI playbook.
---
When ever I try doing /pet it doesn't seem to work.
---
Personally I would love to go back to LK WOW. Myself and many of my friends were talking the other day about how that to us was peak WOW.
---
I'd like the option everyone wants but probably isn't thinking about: Classic+ for 1-2 patches and then TBC, then TBC+ for 1-2 patches, etc.
---
This is literally the most relatable thing I’ve ever read.
---
Third option, provided we're able to copy over classic characters similar to copying characters to the ptr
---
You say need = equipping it like I'm not needing on every tigerseye and shadowgem I come across
---
They claimed 07 was the only backup copy they had, but I doubt a 300 million dollar company only had that portion backed up, especially considering people had literal copies of the game at various points to use as private servers. The real reason they chose 07 is cause if they chose a close point to regular RS it would've absolutely destroyed RS3's playerbase.
---
lol no Wrath basically started WoW's downfall
---
Dont start nothing wont be nothing. :D
---
I didn’t think these would drop in first phase, as they weren’t added in the game till BWL (?) patch.
---
I don't want any of the options, I don't want my character's progression reset
---
Is this on Mankrik? If so, Frog is my boy
---
Yep, same. I genuinely loved all the Cataclysm zones, including Vash’jir (since everyone hates on it), and I’d love to have them all. I’d love them all really, if we can get them while preserving the Classic atmosphere.
---
I got the sarcasm
---
Right, but the issue is, if we get like 5 or 6 raids deep into classic+ then that's a LOT of old content you have to go through to catch up.
---
At some point it will just get unreasonable to require newer players to go through so much stuff just to get to the current tier of raid, like if TBC raids required you to go through vanilla raids first.
---
Maybe gold seller
---
If they restart they’ll lose a ton of casual players. I don’t have time to redo this shit.
---
Hey! It's WeaponSwingTimer
---
Nope.
---
classic with expansions
---
Classic + for sure
---
Warcraft What-If servers. Where we get alternate versions of expansions. 
---
For example, what if in BC we had just joined Illidan instead of fought against him. 
---
A version of Wrath where we manage to save Arthas.
---
Sorry it may not have been clear in my screenshot. What I'm asking is what would cause that HUGE spike in "increasing rate" under memory usage. (its in bold red)
---
I think it's actually a term that originated later in arena comps that had multiple spell damage dealers, and was "backported" to apply to dungeons in classic.
---
Because it ruined the rest of the game, you fail to respond to is other problems with it, dungeon finder is the biggest thing that destroyed retail period
---
Sever resets are indeed the darkest timeline. Il ove my pally too much bros
---
WAN PUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNCCHH
---
That doesn't sound right... I have a 2070 and everything was recommended Ultra
---
But how often is that even the case in pugs?
---
[Blizzard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent)
---
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/company)
---
Because this takes 5x as long.
---
Not speaking to my opinion on the matter, just saying that's why this doesn't/won't happen.
---
you not rolling tank/healer is a self balancing for the game make some friends.
---
About to repost there, thanks!
---
Players are already divided 40 times over by the current servers.
---
The community is big enough that that's not an issue.
---
You could check out r/buildapc and use the website pcpartpicker to make sure everything is compatible. That's about all the insight I have but I would image a middle of the line build would be just fine. My ~$800 PC runs plenty of "modern games" just fine with great graphics and FPS.
---
It is both. Layers don't bring more demand, but provide many more times the supply
---
...more please?
---
West fall has options or you can go to auberdine. There’s a lot of quests there for your level
---
Doing a good job of representing the 12 year olds of the Asmongold fan club. Keep it up buddy
---
Turn off Gsync if you're just playing WoW if you accidentally update the driver and don't want to downgrade. I've had zero screen tearing at 1440p and 145fps.
---
Idk how arena would work when pvp is extremely unbalanced. Ccs need to work like they did in tbc for arena to have a chance
---
It’s literally called 2007 scape haha you’re right
---
Honestly, none of these. Just keep it as it is, which is why people created their own vanilla servers in the first place.
---
I guess the closest option you’re presenting is allowing for more expansions while still allowing Classic as is to remain.
---
I like the idea of weapon skills taking time. Would be cool if there was a target dummy near class trainers to allow you to level it up to. All about that immersion!
---
Moo
---
BTWs exist in WoW too, hey
---
It's what I do. Then again I'm absolutely horrible at AOE grinding and panic over every little thing.
---
I’m a NE priest and am loving it!
---
Also everything you’re reading is from the hardcore min-maxing crowd from private servers.
---
They seem to be pretty quiet now that we’ve seen a week1 MC/Ony clear with people in greens that weren’t even level 60..
---
Bad shoulders
---
Crazy that people would already jave the meta for this game figured out!
---
Almost like people have been playing this for 10+ years.
---
Yeah the largest problem I had with dungeon finder is that you could stand in Org/IF from 15 to 70, never talking to anyone.  It made the game feel really... small.  
---
I would be okay with purposing meeting stones as a LFD tool that simply put you in a healer/tank/3xdps party first come first serve.
---
First try happened the same to me. I was tanking as druid and the funny warrior dps decided to go for it and light them all up "it's funnier that way".
---
My combat "wow" muscles must have kicked in because I managed to tank the most, combat ress the mage, go back to tank and heal someone left and right after the shaman healer went oom half fight.
---
Anyway, kiting is OP in this game :P
---
Meh, at most what 5 slots? Dont almost every class have to carry them, druids have to have to to rez people. I'm also not hurting for bag space to the point where I even notice it lol. Water/potions/bandages probably take up more slots than the things you've listed since I dont carry anything for water walking or water breathing since I haven't been annoyed enough to actually worry about it having to use the spells.
---
I literally had a Warrior run towards me screaming for help as he was chased on the road by a Tarantula in Arathi.
---
I did a drive-by fear, but that wasn't nearly as cool as that drive-by healthstone!
---
butt hurt as well!
---
Excellent, now copy this and macro it so you can easily broadcast every group you play with
---
My ideal would be to have separate servers for each expansion; but allow us to copy [not move] our max level characters over from the previous server when they are released.
---
That way, you can still go back and play whichever expansion you like with content still "current"; and on that server, not have all of your progress and gear reset.
---
I cant understand people that want classic+. All classic content is going to be obsolete in 2 years anyway.
---
Are they planning to go to scholomance in 2 years ? Naxx is going to be on farm 1 month after it's released. There wont be any classic content to explore, only "classic+" content. Might aswell go to iutland
---
It's fun
---
Kara was the best raid by far
---
But the rogue one skipped  subtlety ...I'll see myself out...
---
As much as i love classic, i'd love a BC and Wotlk server as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the dungeons and raids from those expansions.
---
The problem is, the chance is high of them ruining it. And if they ruin it, then it's ruined, we can never go back. They can't develop new content for Classic and then remove it when it turns out it's awful. We will never get Classic back.
---
Mage was my first character back then, so I started now one as well.
---
It's sad to see that people only looking for mages and nothing else to just some grind dungeons...
---
Also I'm not a frost mage, I'm a fire mage and level 42 now.
---
You don't wanna know how many times people told me that I'm an idiot or something for not playing frost.
---
"How can you play fire?! It's so bad"
---
"You don't have any slows"
---
"lol , I deal more damage with frost"
---
No, fire is not bad. Frost might be easier for leveling, but I love the Fire Spec and can't wait for my instant Pyroblast later on!
---
There are very few place in BC you need flying to reach.  The Netherstorm dungeons/raids, Ogrila (which was added post release anyway), skettis and kazzak are the only things I can think of. You have to remember at release in outland you had to be level 70 to get flying (or be a 68 druid.)
---
with the amount of people levelling right now questing is slow because of the mob re spawn. especially if you play on a high pop server.  Its always better to dgn farm if you can. But at the end it depends if you prefer questing over dungeon spamming. There is no rush to 60 so do what you prefer. But if you want to do the most efficient method its dungeon cleaving.
---
Not sure but all this one does is monitor chat and alerts you when someone types LFG/LFM in a separate window. I noticed 2 LFG mods and the other one had an interface that looked like the retail LFG gui so maybe that's the one they hated on?
---
Try it, if it helps you enjoy the game more I don't see why there should be a problem.
---
If you play efficiently you can get any class to level 40 in less than 60 hours play time. And that’s without rushing, you just need to be focused.
---
Didn't get to read through all comments, but am I the only one that wouldn't mind seeing some lore rewritten?
---
I wouldn't mind having an alternate WoW Classic universe, where the Lich King didn't take power. I know I'm probably going to get heat from some people. I just think it would be an interesting route to take.
---
He seems bored
---
Are you tanking in battle stance, or is it just a normal tanking rotation?
---
C+ is the best way because it gives us something fresh without it being retail wow. TBC gave us arena and flight, then Wrath gave us the awful LFD tool.
---
Hmm that's a lot nicer then what happened to me.  Had a five man to finish quest, we get there activate it.  Then a horde group of 4 or 5 shows up and attacks us while we're  trying to kill the elite.   I'm tanking it, we kill them then kill the elite, dumbass horde can never  not be garbage.  It was wierd though thought we were fucke, being that one was a skull to me.
---
Why even bring up reagents for the Rez then?  Hypocritical much?
---
I just saw you in Iron Forge and took a screenshot of you guys! Kromcrush, right?
---
Only new to table-top and dnd was my first, still its awesome to see little things like this
---
Tbf, I was slightly confused. It kinda read as if the class leader was a warrior and the other ones were mad/jelly. Then the int enchant being like a troll thing. I figured it out but I could see where a slight confusion could arise.
---
Just ignore it..
---
Shout-out to all my mage homies waiting outside dungeons with every passing priest and shammy whispering "Water?... Can I get some water?" without saying please. 
---
F
---
Lucky, Fairbanks is dominated by Horde.
---
" I know that I can switch realms, but my friends and I have decided to stay on our server.  " - Then deal with the consequences.
---
Going with a community vote will fuck us lesser played classes like druid and warlock. I imagine Pally and Shammy will get rolled into one on votes for content updates so they won't be under represented like us.
---
I’m on Skeram. I have had a few ok experiences at a small scale, but i have been ganked and teamed up on a lot which isn’t the fun part of PvP for me.
---
In Vanilla i rolled late on Mal Ganis on alliance, so i spent a ton of time getting ganked by goonsquad. This was a fair trade for server-crashing battles in south shore.
---
My hunters name is Alps. My pets name is The.
---
I didn't even know groupfinding addons existed back then. Like you said, nobody used them.
---
I think a lot of people feel that way.  Dual spec, the classes were finally rebalanced with both PVP and PVE options for each class (but still requiring players to make choices/sacrifices), etc.
---
Absolutely Classic Expansions!
---
I kick anyone who is an asshole, ninja or idiot
---
Classic+ with old expansions as well.
---
Ok, that's unfortunate then.  Thanks for the reply.
---
I'm happy to compliment him being good at being an annoying dumbass
---
Because he's a fucking annoying dumbass
---
I dont find that shit funny though, it is 0 effort humour.
---
Because of his snarky tone whole being completely tone deaf to the conversation.
---
Both are fine
---
I loved when a dud did the same to me, thanks!

This has pretty much been my thoughts on a classic+. I'm simply not sure how the game can progress without creating that massive gap between a fresh 60 and a 60 doing current content while keeping the game classic. Gear is supposed to be difficult to acquire, so catch up mechanisms wouldn't be ideal because then well be back to giving people welfare epics. I'd personally would like it if blizzard were to create new expansions all together for classic while keeping the game more or less classic, but I doubt they'd even try, much less pull it off successfully.
---
SL/NF lock with T2/T3 gear begs to differ but its still a long way to go til we have access to it.
---
I’m trying to wipe it from my brain
---
Expansion servers. You can transfer your Classic character to the next level but obviously never back. So if you want to go to BC, you can. Then take that guy to LK. But if you want to live in the Eastern Plaguelands or doing Illidan every weekend for the rest of your life, you're not forced to.
---
He's just talking a little trash. He's keeping it about the game and not going overboard. The game is literally Horde v. Alliance. Can't we have a little rivalry?
---
I like your frost damage set!
---
I mained a mage with a rogue alt for years.  I pvped on rogue and had a blast.  world pvp is super fun cause you can choose what fights to get into.  its a totally different playstyle the the caster type.
---
I must of missed something here.  Nobody was talking to you.
---
Gotcha. How would I get from Thelsamar to Westfall?
---
You're the kind of people we need more of. Lol
---
Hahahah yeah Kromcrush! That’s awesome.
---
classic + Maybe include the expansions but scaled to 60, with new classes like necromancer death knight, demon hunter etc over time. I like this idea but where does it leave retail? If they took this path, maybe diverge retail toward it as well. It all seems like too much work in my opinion.  
---
I would like to see them tone some things back in retail to regain the old immersion. I think if they could model future expansions after the simplicity and the dynamic of wraith of the lich king it would be perfect in my opinion. Just enough world pvp and interaction, just enough accessibility for raiding and pvp. I dont think classic is necessary to do this. Maybe just keep a few of these classic servers around based on the crowds desires, but move retail towards all the new shit. Maybe undo some things like azerite and make the arcane tree for mages like it was in wotlk rather than the pointless bloat that it is now. A necromancer (none hero class) pure dps. A tinker class (tank/int dps, can share armor with paladins to some extent.) Another undeath based expansion would be ideal. Back to having one horde leader, one alliance leader; something that leads the way towards a warcraft 4 (and let some other IP of blizzards take over the MMORPG market like diablo or even a new wow which starts over and used what they learned to do things better the second time. (Skip over the azerite shit and go straight to the wraith design, and stick to what works there while new stuff gets implemented.)
---
I’m not patient enough for that haha
---
TBC Classic, it was the peak of WoW. WotLK will be ok too. Probably nothing beyond that.
---
Must be no changes, you whiny fucks can stay in Vanilla, flying mounts are one of the greatest additions to the game. That and arena.
---
I’m totally down for the classic + experience. The issue with “classic expansions” is where do you actually draw the line? Some people think BC is the best while other think Wotlk is the best
---
Osrs is basically rs3 without MT. I don't agree with the polling system. So many things are just copy paste.
---
The Demo shout nerfs will put this into its place. I used to be able to hold aggro on even single target dps with essentially just demo, it was so overtuned.
---
Since that patch went live I have had to do my old aggro tricks and have people wait a bit. When unskilled tanks start letting people die the meta will shift.
---
Gotcha thanks!
---
Not me. I'll start on anyone.
---
Or just not care what anyone else thinks
---
Sounds good!
---
Elwynn forest, dun morogh for alliance
---
WotLK had some good moments but took every negative aspect TBC introduced and amplified them without considerations for the downsides. I said in TBC that they tried to balance things they knew would have negative effects for example flying by having them be 60%, harder (more expensive relatively) to obtain being able to be dazed off them, knocked off them by other players etc.  
---
  
---
In WotLK they started to stop considering the negative effects things would have on the world and went all in with player retention which is why they doubled down on daily quests and the dungeon badge system. The effect on the playerbase was clear because instead of rapid growth of the playerbase for the first time players started to quit at nearly the same rate as new players joined.  
---
This is all before we even start delve into the brand new negative things they introduced to the game like Wintergrasp, intentional free loot bosses, achievements and the dungeon finder tool.  
---
If I was to take one thing away from WotLK for Classic+ it would be the creative ways they used to offer extra rewards in raids. The "Hard Mode" methods they used in Ulduar were (imo) the best and most creative in the game and I'd welcome them offering similar challenges in Classic+ where you have to kill the same boss in different ways for extra rewards. I disagreed with the later change that the entire instance was just changed to "hard mode" before stepping inside or that they should have separate lockouts.
---
Turns out I'm a crap Warlock. I did all the right things. Followed guides. Named him after a Norwegian Black Metal band. Exclusively listened to Mayhem while leveling. And then finally queued up for RFC. 
---
And was out DPS'd by the tank. So... I quickly learned Immolate was too long for most encounters. So I dropped it. Similarly I found my wand was out-dpsing my shadowbolt. I later found my CoE was doing very minimal damage. My imp was doing more. So... what else can I do to fix?
---
Yeah teleportation, cross realm, and automated party forming are the really big offenders. A single-realm version of the current group finder people use to look for M+ pugs would be ok in my opinion, since its basically just a GUI for LFG chat.
---
Your add-on is devaluing my excel sheet...
---
/s
---
There was no original objective. I mean aside from having fun. Batman I don't have any control over how other people have fun and if they have fun.
---
I feel like classic+ would be the best way to go in the long run. Sure it would be nice to experience some of the other expansions too, but then we’re just replaying the same stuff all over again, up until the point where we’re back in retail again. And the problem with the first option imo, is that with how much of a grind classic is (which isnt a bad thing), i’d be pretty irritated if all of my hard work just got deleted and would have to restart all over.
---
I've always liked the idea of all the expansion  basically in one but phased, so 1-60 your in the classic phase, 60-70 BC etc. and you can only access things from the phase your in. With the option to talk to chrome to jump forward in phases to experiance leveling during BC or whatever and no option to phase back.
---
A sl/nf lock doesnt need fear to kill a rogue.
---
Oof. Looks like he beat you on the hidden roll for initiative.
---
I would.  Hopefully you equip it then I feel alright.
---
Classic expansions undermine all the work you did in classic by giving you greens that are better than your BWL gear.
---
Classic+ would be way more interesting and the meta could really be shooken up with interesting new sets for each class and new, much harder raid bosses that are designed with what we've learned from retail.
---
In what world is stv empty?
---
True Classic in what way, private server? Lose all progress? What a shit idea.
---
for real... i completely forgot treants was a BC talent..until i played classic
---
Classic has flaws such as class/spec balance, however BC introduced flying and made the original zones obsolete, both which I feel were bad.
---
My mage looked nice until I got a mining helmet drop in Uldaman.
---
Nobody hung out in the major cities after shattrath came out, I hated that.
---
Yeah, like a cows opinion, it doesn't matter.
---
I'd love classic plus. I want to see those unfinished zones fleshed out and I absolutely don't want things like dailies and flying mounts that came with TBC to be introduced. 
---
I do love blood elves though... maybe those can come in a content patch that goes into Arthas's charge northward towards the Sunwell but doesn't involve the Dark Portal and Outland?
---
Exactly, I'm not sure you'll find really any Runescape player that thinks that RS07 was better than RS09. Basically when they released D Claws was peak Runescape.
---
I thought of a system, say you were 60 on classic, you could use that char on burning crusade, when you level it there your classic profile stays 60 and you could go back and forth between the characters.
---
If the bear misses a dodge , he gets chunked a lot more than a warrior with all their damage mitigation
---
Awesome idea. A tiny criticism; you might wanna tone down your significant figures. Even nasa doesn't use numbers that precise
---
Yeah regardless of the discussion being had in these comments, this is true. During vanilla the philosophy was put in the work if you want the reward, if you don't like that then this isn't the game for you. 
---
Over time they made more and more concessions toward those who complained and wanted a more casual experience. As we all know, they ended up with a completely different game over time - and the root cause of that was a desire to cater to players who were not the existing group enjoying the game
---
Wrong
---
this is what is wrong with gamers today. 
---
there was a time when you had to be an actual gamer and good at the game to get viewers. now you just need to have an alex jones level personal to draw in the mouth breathers and ad revenue.
---
how anyone thinks this is a good thing is beyond me, because these people that suck shit at these games are shaping the future of gaming with their "influence" (read: ad revenue)
---
Thanks I'll look into it more.
---
Just can be difficult finding specific advice via searches with so many years of content haha
---
what stance you use?
---
Classic +, but talking constantly to the community and making sure to expand on the things people like about Classic. Which IMO is the wild west feeling and harder, quest focused, leveling focused, content.
---
Classic+ combined with Expansions.  
---
I’d love to see them balance Classic, and inject TBC intelligently.  Change the narrative, so to speak, with intelligent changes to the gameplay — no flying mounts, for example.  
---
Bring in the concept of “bring the player,  or the class” but make it more about balancing specs to all be relevant without homogenizing things like they did.  Address long-standing issues, and give each spec the flavor of its class without neutering things because of silly concepts like “hybrid tax.”  Easiest solution here would be to make any hybrid class perform poorly in other “roles” while spec’d hard into one tree (IE, Ret Paladins get a threat and healing penalty when spec’d too deep, Ele Shaman receive a healing penalty, Etc).
---
I use classiclfg addon
---
I want them to release the expansions again, but make it so that you can copy your characters from the Vanilla client to the TBC/Wrath clients. People who wanna play Vanilla can keep playing Vanilla. People who prefer a later expansion can play that.
---
Honestly I would LOVE classic+, Id even say hell, develope NEW expansions starting from classic. The lore reason for us being there is that we used time travel? Make it a full on butterfly effect thing, redo lots of events but with the alliance and horde and/or the players moving faster on them using the knowledge the players brought back. Have it be an ever increasing agent of tension between the alliance and horde as they know ehat attacks would be coming. Have Deepholm be a raid on its own where we literally go and fight a still chained deathwing before he breaks out (Then we could have an actually good fight for one of the biggest bads in WoW.) Have a dungeon where maybe Jaina, the alliance, and some horde turn on Garrosh before Hes really all that powerful, maybe have some of the resistance be horde who think it wrong to kill a man for crimes he hasnt yet committed. We could redo a LOT of fuckups in wow history just based off of the butterfly effect.
---
I could not disagree more.
---
lol, I’m laughing reading your comments raging about how uber locks are haha 😂
---
No, they couldn't. Did you never quest in those locations? Every single spot has flight specific quests. Bombing runs, races, skettis treehouses, etc. Flight actually had a purpose in BC, it wasn't only travel.
---
We were at number one for two days.
---
https://www.figureprints.com/wow/
---
They will 3D print your husbands favorite character.  Buy him a store credit and then let him choose which character and which gear.
---
Put it in the bg room.
---
Neither of them as they are presented.
---
For me personally I found questing sometimes impossible, a combination of PvP and too many players for too little mobs.
---
So I just spam dungeons, I’d rather quest but it’s just feels much more inconsistent compared to dungeon runs.
---
I'm new to wow
---
 I need to get to boot bay I'm 32 warlock to get fishing over 150...
---
I spent 15 mins trying to walk there and noped the fuck out.
---
Took chats advice and res sickness on my 3rd gank.
---
I'll return at 40 with my succubus that place ain't for noobs like me with no friends
---
And don't get me started on the amount of 3 horses vs 1 alliance constantly. If I ever become powerful I will never assert power like that on that zone
---
Jk I will get payback for the alliance.
---
1 copper
---
Creator plays alliance, obviously.
---
yep. fixed #4 (hopefully) lol
---
I liked classic. I LOVED BC and WoLK. I stopped playing after MoP. I don’t have time to do classic now. But if they did BC or Wrath I would have to just go play Kara at least at 70 again. Get that paladin healing shield from chess.
---
Knowing that it is 1/5th is honestly insane. But I'm loving it.
---
Wow, sounds like a barrel of fun for everyone...
---
How we've come full circle. Being thankful for layering existing for months. I feel compelled to hang this on my fridge.
---
Faerlina is a PvP server, yes. If you're a horde, you'll probably be fine because there's a lot of horde on Faerlina. If you're an alliance, well.. it'll be tough for you. There's ways to avoid STV, though. Mainly dungeon spam.
---
It's ok! It's not as bad as it seems because higher levels quests and whatnot award better exp!
---
So you're still about 1/5th of the way there in actually!
---
 I say offer a new game plus that restarts your character once you hit 60, and gives you a handicap till 60 (so the game is harder, but you reap the rewards, like high drop chances or something.)  
---
WoW should not increase the level cap, as it only serves as a big disservice to casual players, and also fucks with the leveling system/experience. Both of which are the bread and butter of the game.
---
It only becomes more daunting and more grindy for new players to lvl from 1-70, 1-80, 1-120. Plus I'm not sure I trust them to rework the classic leveling experience including these number increases without fucking it up.
---
Introduce old Xpac zones as new ways to level from 40-60 or something, and rework that xpac content to fit Classic. So new endgame raids and gear for lvl 60's.  
---
A NG+ for lvl 60's that gimps a player would put them in a position to team up and help new players that have a number advantage (while they have the skill advantage).  
---
This will recycle players back into the same zones, and keep the game looking and feeling populated.  
---
Once CATA comes along, possibly branch out to new content entirely, or atleast don't destroy the world.  
---
Don't raise the level cap and create a never ending and unsolvable problem for yourselves again Blizzard. Don't do it. Please. This is my solution.
---
Everyone keeps hyping up the idea of classic+ but idk I can't just blindingly trust blizzard to make new good content. Also I want to fight the Lich King!
---
I’ve messed with some settings as well trying to have shadows be more noticeable stuff like that. 
---
I played retail on a craptop for nearly a decade, I’m blastin this baby at max as I can get it now that I get to ruin my life all over again lol
---
Loads of dutchies on pyrewood alliance side. Got like 6 dutch guilds over there. One of which has more than 400 members
---
My diSAPpointment. Ftfy.
---
I’ve ranked for like 5 years now on retail, and thankfully am just playing a dps for classic. I don’t think I could handle the “pull pull pull, bigger packs” spam that you sometimes see, especially with so much downtime between fights in classic
---
BC was my favorite expansion and when I had the most fun playing, so i would support updating to that...maybe after a while Wrath.
---
Then the improved ret aura
---
Whatever gets me wotlk the fastest.
---
Teleporting you to the dungeon makes the world feel small and lobby based. Nobody ever has reason to know where the dungeon is even located with the lfg tool, I despise that.
---
Nice
---
Blacksmiths make them, check the AH
---
I agree. Flying was a massive, fundamental end-game feature of BC - you can't just take it out without totally altering what BC *was*.
---
I really enjoyed TBC back in the day. It was the main game I played (came in like 3 months before its release) some of the concepts from WotLK were great but I really loved TBC. I wouldn’t have a problem with Classic + and an option to get TBC content
---
I think for the first time I may need to roll on a pvp server
---
...Yes, they're playing it RIGHT NOW. Because it came out a couple of weeks ago... How dense are you? People will not play this forever.
---
Keep yer feet un teh groond!
---
I'd be fine with the faction imbalance if horde weren't such dishonorable players. It's always 2 v 1, 5 v 2, attack me in the middle of me fighting a mob. They'll watch me and wait til I pull mobs to attack me. What a bunch of losers. I'm not even mad, I'm just sad they're that lame about it. It would own if the faction imbalance meant I just had a treacherous experience where I constantly have to 1 v 1 a horde. It'd feel like a good hard mode essentially. This is just lame and boring.
---
From a priest ... Your welcome 😊
---
Everyone has fun their own way and it is not against ToS so move on.
---
nah, warlocks and summoning stones are completely fine in my book.
---
Couldn't agree more. It's time for a new, updated engine showing what the tech of 2020 can do on an MMO. 
---
Leverage the hard lessons they learned going from an amazing experience classic, all throughout the high peaks and low valleys all the way to BFA.
---
People criticise the current wow but it's hard to keep scaling the same world while keeping it fresh at the same time. It's time for something new. 
---
Also hopefully they hire decent writers that know how to make a different endboss than FACTION LEADER TURNS BAD for wow2s xpacks.
---
Oh and with the classic servers, they should honestly progress regularly like the game did. Classic locked servers will die off in time, and if you create new servers for new expansions, they will all be empty AF.
---
I mean it’s pretty simple to me. Look at us in classic. Look how many posts have been made in the last two three weeks about SOCIAL interaction outside of town. People love it. That is what was lost in expansions. People never leaving town.
---
There’s world pvp all the time now, lost with flying mounts and “teleport to dungeon”
---
If they add dungeon finder, flying mounts it’s repeating history and the game will die again.
---
Don’t repeat history, learn from it. If people want that version of wow, play live. Ez
---
It should hard fork. Allow people to try the path that suits them.
---
&gt;m not sure you'll find really any Runescape player that thinks that RS07 was better than RS09. Basically when they released D Claws was peak   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You instantly found one!!
---
You’re almost at half health, a photo isn’t worth the graveyard run!
---
As a tauren, I resemble that statement.
---
I want some unique content and new dungeons specific to classic also would like to see some new BGs it zones with only PVP that are seamless in the world map with increased honor gain.
---
honestly all 3 sound awesome classic as it stands is a great mmo i knew that when i signed up for my first month back in tbc and i know that now
---
Back in the day, people seemed to be happy with TBC and WotLK
---
It's a perfectly reasonable request lol, some people play both and they aren't asking to be logged into chars on both versions just sat in the queue on one and playing whilst they wait on the other.
---
congrats you are playing on easy mode. Must feel rewarding.
---
Yeah, a bit sad people seems to be clearly salty about it. I earned my ravager by having 4 warriors and paladins get it before it was my turn, it has served me extremely well, as you said with explosive trap combos. But hey, people see (STRENGTH) and think ONLY Warrs can utilise it (with an exception of paladins leveling). Not thinking for themselves to the extent where they post blatant lies like that it would be horrible for Hunters
---
Guild: 87 right now
---
Friends: 0 still
---
My friends are guildies. Not Bnet friends playing overwatch.
---
Exactly. You have to be a dick to someone that needs it to prevent someone else from needing it from also doing that. 
---
You’re part of the problem.
---
No worries!
---
Hit esc -&gt; Interface -&gt; AddOns -&gt; DejaCharacterStats - you'll find it there.
---
The only thing I want is the same thing EverQuest has done. Time Locked Progression. Each xpac unlocks at a certain time frame with content within the expansion unlocking along the way.
---
I once attacked an afk troll player near troll NPCs in STV. Really on accident. I was just trying to cleave the closest mob lol. Turns out he wasn't afk but probably just fiddling with settings. He jumped around confused. We had a good laugh and went on our separate ways.
---
Then a level 47 ud rogue ganked me.
---
Is that an add-on thing? I’m super new to WoW so I’m not 100% sure what I’m doing tbh
---
Kara was supposed to come out in vanilla too as another super dungeon. If they did classic+ (much like OSRS is ran as far as content creation goes) I think it would be amazing to add more tiers but keep the same level cap. Idk how it would be done but I think it's an idea worth exploring.
---
For sure. Rounding to hundredths should be enough.
---
All they have to do is get the Wildstar team to work on it.
---
What would you do with all the leather? Straight vendor, AH, or try and craft some cheap LW gear that sells for a lot?
---
I think they should take a page out of the way Runescape did it. Voting both at banks and auction houses so the player base can decide if they want a feature or not. And I'm pretty sure something like 75% of the player base needs to decide they want it. After that, next stop mobile! Lol
---
Classic+, alternate timeline, new expansions. Emerald Dream
---
Ninja leather
---
yes, this. also brand new players. also old players people who played vanilla 10+ years ago and forgot a lot of stuff.
---
Classic+ all the way. I would love to see some kind of sprawling non-instanced dungeon/raid.
---
Been playing with a guy that's played wow for ten years. He didn't know what tab did a few days ago
---
Can you tie a macro to a button?
---
Yeah, they fixed it after about 4 days. UA Warrior builds were short lived, but more fun than even Gladiator Stance
---
oh yeah, but im talking that Vanilla raid mechanics were quite simple in some bosses.  And in TBC raids were a little more complex but not at the level of being obnoxious, like idk 3000000 things happening in your screen.  I really like that of TBC, Black Temple was amazing for me at least.
---
Twin Emperors were amazing, i cant wait to do that
---
Have him tag mobs, you kill them as you go, kepe him healed buffed and thorns'd.
---
With creative placing, you could work on fishing while keeping him buffed and healed.
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
Struggle is real. They can be skipped.
---
Fucking. Love. Dungeon finder. 
---
I don’t even have to grind  to level. As a tank I could just stay as a tank and run dungeons all day and I leveled so fast. 
---
I was a master at my craft too!! I knew the dungeons inside and out. Pulled at a really fast, but controlled speed. Got the job done fast as hell.
---
Classic+ please! If True Classic were announced today, I'd honestly just quit and I'm only level 22.  That kind of circular gameplay just doesn't do it for me.
---
Exactly!
---
&gt; that Shaman spell taunt totem
---
what? shamans got shit in tbc fire elemental (15 min cd) earth elemental (15 min cd) and bloodlust. So one usefull skill. 
---
Grounding totem that spell taunt totem sounds like is in vanilla.
---
RTX 2060... am I not enough for you?
---
Please for the love of god don’t just repackage old expansions.  Classic + is so much better of an idea.  Sure nostalgia is powerful and all but don’t re-release every old expansion and call it good.  Focus on new content and let nostalgia have its place exactly where it should be, in our memories.  Don’t get me wrong, classic is crushing it and bringing back so many players but instead of just recycling old material, make GOOD new material.  Keep your players don’t try to give them 10 year-old content and hope nostalgia overcomes them.
---
watch out they might claim a "national emergency" and bypass the balance of powers.
---
Because that's how classic was.
---
even solo as a rogue? i’m quite interested, if not only for a little to change things up a bit
---
You are definitely a retail casual. Every point you make says that. Get off this sub pleb.
---
I still consider Cata, MoP, WoD and Legion to be the "retail" side of WoW, while I consider Vanilla, Burning Crusade and half of Wrath to be more "classic." I think I alluded to this as well, but I agree, retail isn't in a good spot by most standards.
---
I'll edit my post to reflect my intentions.
---
Never join world chat and only use LFG chat when needing a group and friends aren't on.
---
Looks like a different kind of game to me. But I don't want to say which type because it might give blizzard ideas and they'll start asking if we have phones.
---
I remember back in the day people left corpses named "steveirwin" or some variation of it along the beaches outside of Grom'gol base camp.
---
For those who want to check it out in game.
---
Go to Stonetalon Mountain (68,91) and use Far Sight at the highest mountain, than use it again to get to the other side of the mountain. ([http://prntscr.com/p5gj74](http://prntscr.com/p5gj74) )
---
Not by the original author, but someone else made a quick fix for the addon to make it work in Classic.
---
The story ended for me when we killed Arthas- it’s the completion of the storyline that I cared most about, with an epic fight against an iconic enemy with a cool ending.
---
I'd like to see BC at least.  Not necessarily soon, but later, yes. 
---
I'd like to get my fill of classic and move *when I am ready* not when blizz decides to drop it.  I'd not cry over lich king content either.  But again when I'm ready.
---
I think that's a huge draw for me.  I want to complete sets. I want to experience the grind.  I want to get rep.  Then I decide when all my work is worthless.
---
Just use it. It’s not going to be worth much right now until economies stabilize anyway.
---
Frost is best for leveling but you can go arcane fire if you like it will just be a little slower leveling.
---
I just want Arenas in the game
---
Why not split it off so you had 10 man and 25 man raids but not the same ones so like Icc would be 25 only and TOTC would be a 10 man only each varying in difficulty obviously but would make for better groupings
---
No wrath expansion and its good
---
Ya I don't get this either. Someone just go loot it and roll for the green.
---
Cant tell if sarcasm or not.
---
I would like BC and WotLK but on separate servers with the option to transfer or copy your classic character over to the new servers.
---
Yah know, I wouldn't mind having TBC stuff introduced into Classic+ Settings because TBC fixed a lot of things vanilla was.
---
Just gimme Classic+ and the reclaiming of Gnomeregan.
---
FOR GNOMEREGAN!
---
r/wow this is the Classic subreddit
---
After he snapped this pic the dwarf hunter realized that there was  Horde hunters and rogues behind him. At lest you got a nice picture of how far of drop that you will experience.
---
Why 6? Why not settle at 5, or do a whole 10?
---
Sorry, arbitrary number listicles are a pet-peeve.
---
Dude I'm playing on a Thinkpad laptop t420 I bought on eBay for $80, go dumpster diving and you'll find a PC that can run it.
---
And at the top of the food chain sits Bobby Kotick, one of the greediest people in industry.
---
Every single SM Cath run I've done, we killed him. I was unaware that people ever skipped this guy.
---
I couldn't understand. Can you please speak common?
---
up to WoTLK but without dungeon finder
---
Read that in Michael's voice
---
Unique classic content. Like what Old school runescape does but for classic.
---
Wow's worst enemy is the players. The only way classic+ can work is if the developers ignore players.
---
The problem with druids is getting a raid spot in the first place. You only need 1 in raids, most guilds will bring a second for fun but there are far more druids than there are raid spots unlike every other class except hunters, their in the same boat as druids in terms of raid spots.
---
*Shudders in loss of free trade*
---
im wondering what flight paths go over this
---
What if they tried to build an in-world lfg.
---
For example a bulletin board type thing in the major cities that you need to run to and create a post to put on the board.
---
Then other people need to go to the board to see what's been posted.
---
Players can lfg on their own server then, but it still doesn't automatically create the group or teleport you to the instance.
---
I agree Classic isn't flawless when it comes to corridor style dungeons but even when Classic has corridor dungeons it felt like they were more alive and a part of the world than future corridors. For example SM library is a perfect example of a corridor dungeon but the amount of patrols and side rooms people mistaken pull make it feel like you're actually in a monastery.
---
Stick it in your bank til p3
---
Well according to that chart, I wouldn't want "True Classic."
---
I like the idea that, after a while, I could have a character with literally every BiS item. Why can't we just have 1 true box server that never resets?
---
Love the other two options, though.
---
Wotlk had a rapid growth in playerbase, It is the peak of WoW
---
Dot all the targets with curse of agony and your instant cast corruption then shadowbolt spam or wand the focused target. Rinse repeat.
---
Two different clients, never going to happen
---
Honestly jmm, just give me some updated textures in classic and I'm set for a few years.
---
I thought the Classic community might appreciate this more than the retailers.
---
Correct. This is why a good tank was a diamond in the rough.
---
Classic+ is what i'd like, but what is the hate for flying? I love flying. I want to be able to fly in the entirety of classic. I don't see how flying is "anti-classic" from a mechanics standpoint. If anything, it makes no sense that players can't get a flying mount in classic. There's clearly a large number of trained flying beasts/machines throughout the world. 
---
It's an excellent milestone that is massively rewarding. Hitting 67 and unlocking flying is maybe my favorite memory from playing WoW.
---
I’m ok with also adding more talents point u locks while we remain at 60, while the also grow the trees vertically. More talents without ruining the level cap experience. That would be preferable.
---
Start paying gold for help. Past level 40 your income from quests and mobs dramaticaly increases. Sometimes all it takes is to offer 3-4g to some high level nearby and it's done.
---
Would be a nice addition, but only a stopgap. Hybrid classes aren't the only ones with issues - survival hunters, for example, could really use a bit of viability. A lot of 31 point talents go virtually unused in popular builds for being lackluster.
---
How is gay boys comparable to some name referencing politics??  What is your point in even bringing that up? Do you just hope to get people to report it
---
as one of the higher level mages on my server (in my 50s, only 1 60 mage), i get quite a few whispers while questing. i made a macro, i charge 1.5g for 3 stacks which i consider pretty fair. most are ok with that. but there have been times where i get 10 whispers in a 2 min span so as goblins say, time is money!
---
water is free for groups of course.
---
Why not all of the above?
---
To be honest, as much as I love BC and Wrath... god I would love a Classic + or a new AU. No awful corner painting like in cata and Wod.
---
Laughs in shaman
---
You know whats funny?
---
Fine by me, I never wanted to run with that type of group anyway.  That's not what I did in Vanilla, or private servers.  How in the hell some private servers were able to capture the Vanilla experience better than the current developers can is just mind-blowing and infuriating.
---
Oh and ps: I mained Priest from Vanilla to Cata so I’m aware of their strengths and limits
---
theres no way you think these numbers are real
---
Personally, i would want a classic + BC server
---
Fuck off and play tbc then you twat.
---
#nochanges you fucking idiot.
---
Shadowfang bruh
---
meh, mostly I just wanted to bitch about a crappy experience I had with a tank, but then decided to try and be positive and make my bitching more constructive.
---
If honestly like a mix of these options. Like classic comes out and stays a while. Then Butning crusade comes out and stays a while. Then Wrath. 
---
I started in Cata. So knowing that will probably help make sense of why I’d want it that way. I’d like to experience what I couldn’t if that makes sense.
---
At first I was like bullshit, but then I read your list.  Yeah... I actually started in BC, so I didn't know any better, but all the things you said sucked.
---
-shrug- probably tera players
---
LOL these are exactly the things I mentioned a year ago and got downvoted.  These are literally the only things to do to keep it a fresh and replayable game.  I could honestly see then doing all three eventually.
---
I would like Classic Expansion, but with a Classic Plus element of keeping the same level of difficulty and complexity of the original game. Also no flying, sharing, or dungeon finder.
---
Did you give it a shot?
---
And separate subscriptions
---
Just watch Beetleguese  and you will!
---
I dont see Blizzard risking so much free money from TBC and WotLK, which are guaranteed to succeed and instead investing millions into development of Classic+. But obviously new content would be something I would prefer.
---
Yep, and theres no reason we can't revisit some aspects of the expansions in this divergence.
---
I really enjoy gnomes, they're hilarious, but I play Horde.
---
Alliance is full of 14 year olds playing night elves and I just cannot stand night elves.
---
Unfortunately once blood elves came, horde was also full of the elf plague, but thankfully there's no elves on horde.
---
God I hate elves and elf players. They make me irrationally angry, they're just always piloted by a dumbass.
---
I realize I'm being irrational but I feel you wanted honesty.
---
Get help
---
Classic with the off spec viability for all classes like in BC along with dual spec talent trees in WotLK.
---
Thanks! So with her being lvl 13 should we be shooting for lvl 16 mobs? Orange level
---
i dunno man. when i was last on retail seeing someone from MY server was pretty rare.
---
I'm not opposed to this. However, the idea of adding even 1 talent point makes balance a huge issue and would require a lot of overhaul. There was a glitch in vanilla that have warriors 1 extra point for a day and it broke so many things. They could get mortal strike and something deep in fury tree. Imagine every class got 1 point and how much more powerful they would be for it.
---
I wanna ba able to play BC again cause that's when I had the most fun with WoW. It would be cool to see it take some sort of alternative history path though
---
He's talking about dps?
---
Yeah because most locks are most likley in some sort of leveling or pve spec right now, it will change when you face people with a proper pvp spec and actual gear.
---
People that play rogue for ages on classic servers and vanilla say that locks are one of the hardest things that you can fight as a rogue 1v1 and usually ends with the rogue dead.
---
I assume you are better than people playing rogue in a classic enviroment for over 10 years?
---
Don't sweat the DPS too much. It sounds like you're new, and low level to boot. Rogue has no AoE at that level, so only single target (essentially bosses) is an area where you'll be possibly able to do more DPS than other classes. DPS for rogues is also much more gear dependent than, for example, casters.
---
Hey, whatever makes your classic experience more enjoyable
---
I’ve said this before to my friends but I would love classic+ and for them to eventually adapt / add the spells that came with TBC and Wrath. 
---
Keep the level cap at 60, however, they could do something unique (think of ESO’s champion point system) that is awarded based on xp up to ten additional points (for each expansion) 
---
This would give players the ability to use the TBC / wrath talents, and give them a reason to quest in outlands + northrend but by keeping the level cap at 60 would still promote you doing dungeons and the vanilla raids.
---
I'm curious about classic wow. I was heavily playing between BC and WK. I stopped right around the Sunwell release (did all the grinding on the island but never completed the raid).
---
I had never looked back until this classic released. I had always heard how good the game was "back in the day" and I really enjoyed what it was then...
---
So I think I may end up trying this classic version but I have a concern...if they start adding the expansions won't it just end up where it is today? Just like 10 years staggered? I don't get why this is even a thought.
---
Also can someone help me understand what the middle column means?
---
multi boxing druids is stupid. 
---
A good multiboxer would box shamans. Chain lightning will kill more than just the mage. 5 grounding totems, unlimited silences, all heals/rez, ghost wolf
---
My schedule is pretty jam packed atm and I've been leveling pretty slowly. At 60, I may have limited time to raid to get gear. My main interest is PvP, I'm wondering if I would be at a great disadvantage due to my lack of raiding gear especially in battlegrounds.
---
Bro, wtf do you think the meeting stone was originally for? Lol
---
You mean the raid frames that are in nearly every Molten Core screenshot ever?
---
Thunderstomp and demoralizing shout I believe, and tab target sunders, revenge when it pops.
---
This has only increased the demand for mages for most of the exp runs (ZF, BRD, first part of LBRS) because warriors are now redundant and you just run 4 mages and cycle Nova's / have one use imp blizzard
---
Shout out to all the gnome mages on my server
---
What would you think about an alternate timeline type deal to prevent conflicts? I feel that a lot of these suggestions start reaching into non canon vs canon ideas that just conflict whereas creating a separate universe allows for all kinds of changes.
---
You should be allowed to one time move a character from cap of one expansion and into another. This would be a one way trip if you decide to move forward. So for instance, at 60 in vanilla you would be allowed to xfer to the bc server. You can make new toons on the bc server, so your main can help alts, but they can only move forward in time. At 70, when wotlk is coming out, same thing.
---
I think it would be crucial to allow people to enjoy the version of the game they want to play, but I also think there would be too large of a player base that want the future xpacs to ignore with just classic vanilla. With this system you could level a toon in eqch xpac for that truly authentic experience at any time!
---
Blizz pls!
---
It's a shame that there is no way they could replace those quests with something else.
---
How about a WoW MMO during when azeroth was one massive supercontinent?
---
i said they should do this months ago on the forums and i was shit on for it
---
Yea spoke like a true vanilla elitist who has never set a foot in a retail raid
---
I can believe these numbers I always see the same people from my realm around
---
&gt;And as Ret, I'd expect my damage to be reasonable. I'd expect to be maybe around 75%-80% of primary DPSers, because I supplement with good utility.
---
This is pretty accurate for a vanilla retri paladin.
---
Go back to retail.
---
Classic+ is definitely the better option with never before seen option, keeping content relevant since you don't outlevel it, etc. But let's face it, BC and Wrath is way less effort for them and would likely keep something close to the same sub numbers. Classic+ is never happening.
---
A reset on classic is straight up detrimental to the game except for the very few who are already 60 as of writing this that would run out of content too fast. Probably the worst idea.
---
Yes, for 10 silver.  He probably still used it a few levels later when he could though.
---
ARENASSSSSSSSSS
---
My experience today. Ended up healing for a lvl 56 and giving him just enough edge to best the 60 harassing astranaar.
---
I noticed the orange eyes in the bushes in duskwood for the first time. Little stuff that really makes the world feel cool
---
Yeah... Trials of the Crusader was legit the worst raid in WoW. Ever.
---
I had to upgrade to my most rent driver to get it I believe, check that out first!!
---
Classic is being rolled out in phases to help preserve how the original vanilla was experienced.
---
See the blue post here about the phases. Phase 3 is when battlegrounds are released. 
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346
---
Classic +, as well as new original content, i'd like to have at least TBC following all of the Vanilla Phases they have planned. Maybe with slight changes, eg: no flying mounts.   
---
WOTLK would be nice too but again, no dungeon finder etc.  
---
Keep it Classic.
---
&gt; irrelevant comment to the discussion
---
But the post is irrelevant in the first place.
---
How lame are you that you somehow need retail to fail to be happy LMAO
---
This is why we require a supermajority vote of active players to approve changes
---
True Classic. While Classic Plus might be interesting if they brought the right content in, its a slippery slope. Retail just didn't flip a switch and become what it is today but it was a gradual change. Introducing changes means its not classic anymore and at what point are we too retail to be classic.
---
I've wrote, that I'm in progress on the RPPVP realm at the moment, but unfortunately begin having backpedaling thoughts again.
---
Ok, so funny you link me this. This is the spec I was gonna run until I came across stay safe lol
---
I didn’t think you’d hate. Just needed you to know where I was coming from haha
---
Do you think it’s worth respecing now? Or wait till 40?
---
Appreciate the reply and the info :)
---
I think it’s great fun,
---
Please no my dreams
---
I want them to start completely over and come out with basically wow 2 starting with the classic we know and love but then making a new xpac instead of burning crusade and taking the game in a completely different direction, no pandas as well
---
I do not want to rehash old expansions, classic+ is definitely the better option.
---
My absolute dream scenario is they release classic servers up to Wrath (TBC minimum pl0x) with character copy just like in retail PTR, either having an end date for official Classic Vanilla which would conglomerate the remainder of the playerbase that want's to continue classic onto a single server (or more if needed). Idk how they would make this work with guilds and shit but I'd imagine they need the server space by the time another expac is in the works. They made it work with original servers shutting down so I can't imagine they can't work out a transfer system to a populated realm to keep vanilla alive to those who want.

So back to the character copy, this would allow us to continue our journey on our original Classic characters without having to start fresh or on templates (yikes) without fucking over people that just want to play Vanilla. I don't want some ultimate conclusion where we HAVE to progress our character, it'd be much cooler if I could transfer my warrior to the new server and be 70 on it and when i get bored, go back to my 60 of the same character and do shit on that.
---
It’s worth the 20s just for granting it to your group for a BFD run or two if you ask me.
---
And saving for what mount? These are warlocks we’re talking about...
---
Interesting, I find that odd because that’s the same version I have :/
---
Classic+ 100%
---
Same!!!
---
Try being a tank, or a healer... where you need a dps to group with.
---
And it sucks being denied group because your mentality of, oh I want to do this faster, fuck everyone else
---
Thing with diablo is you can progress at a decent pace.  Running 45min dungeon for maybe one upgrade, how long until an alt can even go to new outland?
---
To branch away from the community aspect is to fall into the trap of LFG and constantly catching up. New players should be incentivised to play through all of the content rather than overlooking it as is the case in retail with instant end levels. Keeping to the original grind and leveling up should stay as is. End content will be there for those that work up to it. Catching everyone up is what brings the community together. If end gear people want to chase the carrot without looking back and helping, then that's what retail is for.

Why do human bite self when chewing? Human eat every day lots of time but still bite self like a big stupid.
---
On alliance, cooked. The recipe is worth more on alliance, usually, as well.
---
let me guess, carry io?
---
Change WoW classic to WoW2 with new and original expansions.
---
I like Asmongold he's entertaining and the reason I got back into playing Classic Wow as he made it look like a lot of fun. The great thing about reddit is the community can upvote or downvote what is wanted on a subreddit. If the /r/classicwow community doesn't want asmongold content just downvote and move on.
---
In a similar vein, on an RP server I've seen a guild called &lt;Gryphon Master&gt;. The guildmaster stands around in stormwind around the gryphons RPing as the flight master.
---
TBC and then WOTLK+ please
---
As you can see, no "addons" button on the bottom left of the character screen, nor on the menu, nor under interface.
---
My addons are still in their proper folder. I haven't touched anything since logging off last night.
---
Excellent snake, age hasn't slowed you down one bit.
---
I would definitely want to go classic+ with a new storyline and progression entirely.
---
This is exactly what I wanted to see in dungeon finder tbh. 
---
I hate that modern wow feels like world of menus. You want to que for dungeon open a menu. Want to que for pvp open a menu. Do a raid finder? Open a menu. 
---
I felt like all of those things should have been an npc you talk to in the game to que. 
---
I like having to go somewhere to que. It gets people out into the world somewhere and being present. Hiding in cities waiting around i think was the worst thing they added.
---
That vendor trash becomes good regents for enchanting
---
A really good tip to a tailor is extra cloth! I love when people tip with extra cloth because it helps me level my Tailoring more.
---
The problem with the dungeon finder is that it does nothing to curb shitbag behavior. I deal with shitheads at work all day. Just let me get a good fucking group of nice people to play with for fuck sake.
---
I only want dual spec...does that count as Classic+
---
as a shaman healer main I try to always throw up a healing stream totem and top off  melee classes if I pass by. good deed and all that.
---
Nothing that important. People usually use some type of macro to cancel form iceblock for when you just want to use it and remove it asap like to remove blind. Lots of people use mouseover for cs and poly. If you're not much into pvp though you're fine with 0 macros.   
---
Some people macro wand onto the end of a spell to use in their rotation, like fireblast -&gt; wand one button.
---
I’m still not home to get on my computer yet :/ 
---
Right when I’m off work tho I’m excited :)
---
So am I the onoy onr who remembere the whole NoChanges thing... And now everyone wants Changes?
---
What the hell?  You're all gonna regret it.  Any option other than Classic will end up like retail - dead.
---
second ProTip: /cast Overpower \[target=mouseover\] (at uni rn, i think thats right) soon as you see a dodge, drag mouse over mobs and spam macro. win.
---
Classic+ is probably the best route. I would love BC to be incorporated somewhere down the line but if they branch out with all of that it might divide their playerbase up too much to be sensible. If they do xhoose to roll out BC or even more expansion content the ppl who have a level 60 on a classic server should get a free boost to 50-60 on the next content imo but I'm sure that's gonna irk some tryhards
---
Cool thanks
---
I remember Druid tanks hitting 50k
---
it's not mine though, a guildmate sent me this
---
Try playing modern wow then. The modern wow experience is
---
* Sit in capital city
---
* Hit LFG
---
* Get entered into a random dungeon with random people from random different realms
---
* You've never been to this dungeon before, but as long as you're not braindead it's insultingly easy to clear
---
* Nobody says a goddamn word the entire time.
---
* Everyone receives personalized loot, so there isn't even any banter about need or greed rolling, or cool drops.
---
* Quests begin at the start and end at the end. They'll also just randomly pop up, from the universe itself. So it's basically impossible to get in any way invested in the story or lore.
---
* If you do somehow wipe, expect half the party to immediately bail, causing the entire run to collapse.
---
* The entire run only takes like 20-30 minutes.
---
* And then you get a bag full of blue quality gear, just for RUNNING the dungeon.
---
* Repeat until you hit max level!
---
* Repeat with LFR!
---
I once got lost in a dungeon because I didn't see the party go down a set of stairs, and it took TEN MINUTES for me to find them. I was sending messages asking where they were, they didn't even seem to realize I was gone, they were on the next boss when I caught up.
---
It's a completely shallow and vapid experience that leaves no impact on you whatsoever. LFG actually ruined the game, no joke. You'll hit max level easy, with constant good gear, never speaking to another human, without ever leaving the capital city, once you hit level 15. You probably won't even be able to remember the names of half the dungeons you run, and you definitely won't remember any of the bosses, mechanics, loot, or people.
---
Edge Master is a character in the Soul Calibur series who upon selecting, uses a random weapon/fightingstyle from across the whole cast! Plus, the gloves have a similar colorscheme to the ones he's wearing.
---
Thank y’all for the advice that’s badass!!
---
You had more time limitations in high school than you do as an adult? Teach me your ways lol
---
I would enjoy the expansions if they didn't include cheesy game breaking classes like deathknight/demonhunter/monk. If they keep it to the rock/paper/scissors without adding in these God-hand classes and their abilities then yeah, expansions all the way. If not, classic plus it is.
---
But doesnt it get left in the dust pre 40 as well? I cant imagine grinding mobs, one at a time, being at all efficient compared to questing at any level
---
Yep! Install/open the twitch app and then go to mods&gt;world of Warcraft and shop around!
---
Right? Like, what's the point of being on a DISCUSSION board if we don't want to DISCUSS?
---
If you guys choose anything but Classic as it is I'm going to laugh so hard in the future when you eventually ask for regular classic again
---
I’m actually avoiding all the pvp heavy areas for now. I’m enjoying the calm of grinding mobs.
---
Retail is Classic’s *direct competitor*. Comparing World of Warcraft X to World of Warcraft Y is not remotely similar to comparing WoW to ESO or the like.
---
Stop distorting facts and trying to force your asinine opinions onto others.
---
Your initial argument was that this post had nothing to do with Classic. It did. Gtfo.
---
I think a classic+ but then move similarly with expansions would be the best. Imagine adding content to elongate the enjoyment of classic and the expansions. Add a few raids and instances, maybe add different battlegrounds map. Then after a while progress to BC and do the same thing. This way pureists get time untouched, then innovative exciting new content sprinkled in with the patches ppl know and love.
---
I would like to see additional servers released in the future for the BC and WotLK expansions, potentially with free character copies.
---
This comment is wrong. While there was a group of people who were okay with pre eoc, the general consensus was that 2006 was where people wanted. Very few people played rsc still.
---
Ideally? Branching expansions, with each expansion getting the + treatment. Branch to an alternate timeline after Wrath, where the cataclysm never happened, the dragon aspects live, Thrall isn't Jesus, and Garrosh doesn't get the chance to become Hitler.
---
This is evil. I like this very much.
---
Direct competitor. So an MMO vs an MMO isn't competition?
---
I would Reeeeeeeeeally love Deviated story lines from How it originally was and lead into Retail.
---
Start killing mobs. Back in vanilla if I wasn’t strong enough to do a quest id just kill mobs for hours leveling up
---
1v1 me bro 😆
---
Oh yes, the good old warlock cata experience...  
---
*What if you...*  
---
*Wanted to beat mages in aoe...*  
---
*But* *~~god~~* *your RL said...*  
---
"You cant be in melee, you fcking idiot."
---
Oh god I hope I’m not bugging you by asking another question, but what’s the twitch app?
---
People are also doing SM more than once unlike most people doing SFK. I spammed it until 43.
---
Thanks mate, i appreciate. I farmed it for long term gain as i heard it was a licence to print money
---
Run the numbers yourself
---
Void hits for almost nothing
---
Other pets account for 25+% of your damage, I.e. a 33% dps increase
---
Unless you are doing 33% more damage by not face tanking mobs with void, it is the inferior pet for clear speed.
---
Classic + please, anything else would just go down the same wrong path and resetting my character I'd cry :(
---
Also this sub: "Multiboxing sucks"
---
Also this sub: "Twinking is awesome"
---
Different people have different opinions.
---
Good joke rated 9/11
---
Since MoP(?), that's been removed from the terms of service. It's part of the classic ToS though.
---
So Ironfoe **can** proc off itself.
---
The game is only out for 2 weeks and you are already thinking 2 years ahead.
---
not sure on what server you are playing but i have seen the staff as low as 80g on the ah while the usual price is around 120 on my server.
---
still quite a bit of gold but the staff is still one of the best weapons pre MC for casters.
---
Personally summoning is what ruined the game for me and I wouldn't bother playing a version that had it. So nex release would have been a no-go. I think a lot of players from around when I started (2003ish?) feel that way too. But I get how that era is peak RS for a lot of people. It was definitely a great version of the game despite the blemishes from the years beforehand
---
But only Heroic Strike if you have extra rage to burn.
---
Everquest has been doing this sort of thing for years.  They call it TLP's, time locked progression.  They've played with the options a number of times.  They've had slow exp gain servers, fast exp servers, servers locked at an expansion at what was arguably the height of EQ popularity (planes of power) some slow progression servers, one or two super fast progression servers...and the most recent announce is one that starts at an expansion later in the game and everyone starts off at level 85.
---
I did play on one TLP, and had a blast doing it...right up until I quit.
---
Many people constantly flock to whatever the newest TLP server is, intentionally.  WoW and EQ are very different games, surely lots of WoW players have played EQ and vice versa, but if what EQ TLP's servers have shown..."if you build it, they will come".
---
What's wrong with it?
---
Meh even J Allen Brack is too much for this kind of update process
---
As a level 36 priest, my PWF uses about 1/3 of my Mana. I give it out to everyone. At a Zeppelin or boat, I'll stop and drink multiple times to make sure everyone enjoys that +32 Stam for 30 minutes. Don't expect anything in return, just something about this game brings out the best in buffers
---
Yo this is awesome, I appreciate you taking the time to do it! Cant wait to show it to the bois!
---
Mob tagging wasn't nerfed, private servers got it wrong
---
As someone who had to play on low pop servers cause everyone would declare themselves "done" and expected you to pay them to get them into dungeons cause we couldn't "guest" on high pop servers...
---
I want BC Minus. Basically BC remade in Classic's image. No flying mounts, etc.
---
There needs to just not be flying mounts, ever.
---
That makes sense, not sure how I missed those videos back in the day, lol. I do remember druid bear bombs from the sky, that was fun.
---
&gt; No it doesn't work that way. Just for the sake of a visual image, imagine a pizza cut into 4 big slices. It's still one pizza. Now imagine it was cut into 2 bigger slices. Still one pizza, same amount of pizza, just fewer but bigger slices.
---
&gt; 
---
That's not how it works. Imagine a pizza cut into 6 slices. Now take a second pizza and add it on top of the first pizza in a second layer. 2x as many players. 3 layers = 3x as many players.
---
You've never worked in an office environment have you? Just because you're doing software doesn't mean you're not allowed to influence game design. These teams don't work in bubbles. In fact, game design is often very tied with software because someone needs to turns ideas into reality. The only way you'd have no influence is if you're new or quiet.
---
I thought if you put someone on ignore, it wouldn't group you in the same group with them anymore.
---
why would you say that?  it has 100% coefficient over 8s on an aoe.  thats good scaling....
---
You sound like you have bruised ego.
---
I wish they had sc with nerfed rewards. That was one of the few minigames that was fun.
---
Ignoring "fun servers" and instant max level servers, the most popular jagex-like private servers were based on 2006 before OSRS came out.
---
The first section mobs will be grey to you and most mobs will be green. At 23 I'd just move on. The main reason for doing dungeons &lt;50 is just for the exp - all your gear will quickly be replaced anyway.  
---
Of course you can do it if you want, but from an efficiency stand point it's not going to be a great use of time.
---
If you catch a higher level pet are you just SoL with for training points? I love had the same Barrens cat and I'm 34. I ran into Humar earlier, and have zero TP to put skills in. Is it even worth using it at this point?
---
They have heals and I hate healing. Everything else sounds amazing.
---
Classic+ is the only option I see not sucking. If classic goes BC then private vanilla servers will just happen again and we're back to where we started. I don't think people want server wipes, but I dunno.
---
They should just make you pay for the expansions again every year.
---
The desktop application twitch puts out for streaming/watching games.
---
sksksksksksksksk
---
My precious little blueberrrrrieees
---
Wow you managed to get two different spellcheck errors for the word aoe.
---
omg i need to do this. great idea
---
Geared feral druids had 50k hp in bear form at the end of Wrath.
---
Famous last words
---
that place made me sad as a Tauren in vanilla
---
All of the above?
---
Or just launch a new server without char xfers. Fresh toons only.
---
Classic PLUS and it’s not even close
---
I get the sarcasm, but why would they? Flight had a purpose. Instead of completely scrapping that purpose and changing how flight works, just add/expand the thing that worked and was fun. The Netherwing shit was awesome, it's fucking stupid that they scrapped the entire idea, and it's equally stupid that people think flight as a whole should change, when there's already a system that worked. Just give flight a purpose beyond traveling point A to point B.
---
What else do you expect from the French?
---
Give me Wrath or give me death.
---
Any time I do get on retail, all I really do at this point is just farm transmogs and mounts.
---
&gt; Yeah most players would probably say they wished it would have been around nex release not 07.
---
Disagree. Summoning itself was controversial enough, but Nex armors completely broke the game.
---
Classic Expansions!
---
INTREHST YE IN A PIENT?!
---
Goodbye Shadowmeld + Mind control :(
---
It wouldn't/shouldn't get deleted. Just have the current servers be marked as final phase once they wrap up, and roll out a smaller set of new ones starting at phase 1 again.
---
If you've got a friend who is a pocket priest, you'll have a great time in pvp.
---
Most retail slutmog are made from classic armors.
---
Thanks for the resource! And that's good to hear that's about the budget I want to try and hit myself
---
We have normality. I repeat, we have normality. Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem.
---
Roll hunter, everyone's hating on them. Hard mode in WoW Classic is rolling Alliance Hunter and being good.
---
Ideally I want classic to stay the same as a time capsule and i want retail to be just as good as vanilla with the old game design philosophies in mind.
---
 Realistically I dont believe blizzard can make retail good again so I want BC and Wrath expansions.
---
ahaha
---
Can easily believe those numbers are real
---
Time to hit up those boars in elwynn
---
Well for sure I know that 30 minutes is more than enough time to meet many people, play with people, form groups and make friends and join or make a guild and really make an effort to invest in forming your community experience.
---
Yeah good call, there was probably no chance you were going to find fun on retail
---
Spaghetti and meatballs!
---
my macro for when a random person whispers me is /r as you are aware, vending machines are unfortunately not free, and as a vending machine my cookies and drinks cost a penny too. it is 1.5g for 3 stacks.
---
yah, just drag the macro icon to a bar.
---
As long as they don't do the server resets I'm happy. That is just silly.
---
Battle shout spam isnt always reliable, especially if you have a couple mages. I know what you're talking about, but I've found that works better with stacked melee cleave where the party is close together. And when you're in a party comp like that, you all might as well DPS and speed clear without tanking. Regardless, it's not something you should be doing 24/7 in a pug.
---
Why would you pop demo and clap way later? It's my understanding that you want to maintain these debuffs throughout all fights. How is a couple of sunders outweighing the value of less incoming damage from multiple sources? You still end up sundering 1 second into your charge. 
---
If you have say, 130 sword skill and 190 2h axe skill, when you are casting sunder, which weapon will more reliably land the skill and not miss?
---
While obviously there's not much love for retail here... 
---
This seems like a bait post when you say you did all these things and interacted with so many people, just to end your post with saying you played for 30 minutes.
---
this
---
&gt; engaging and exciting gameplay
---
So... no new skill will ever be approved? Because that fits only about 5 of them.
---
Is there good money in making the parachute cloak in engineering? I managed to win the schematic in SM yesterday and it seems like there isn’t an easy way for non mages to have a slow fall outside of the cloak.
---
Also what doors do the large seaforim charge break? I also got this in an SM run and wondering if there’s anything actually worth using them on especially in the later game. Maybe LBRS or BRD?
---
I think that's fine. Some good content has failed to pass, but a LOT more bad content has failed. It's a pretty effective filter.
---
This comment is far too underrated. I'd give you all my Golds/Silvers if I had any.
---
r/watchpeopledieinside
---
What???? What about it doesn't fit into the game?
---
Hi Shawty, it's now on curse! Hopefully you can find it on twitch as well.
---
Classic+ in this case is what I dream of. It's a chance to learn from mistakes and take from successes and try something new all over again.
---
Had lock sitting on the walls casting down on everyone. I’ll have my revenge.
---
or you could make air combat a thing
---
Sorry for the confusion.  I realize "shit" is not exactly a clear term. :)
---
I was only talking about rezzes, which was in regards to your first sentence:
---
&gt; As a shaman I can walk on water and breath underwater without a quest, just reagents.   
---
&gt;...  
---
&gt; Doing a quest and having something forever vs having to buy shit and take up inv space? 
---
Hypocritical part (at least it seemed that way to me - could be I misread you):
---
&gt; without a quest, just reagents 
---
\- Sounds like "+1 for Shaman since they have reagents"
---
&gt; consistent res in a group without reagents 
---
\- Sound like "+1 for Shaman since they don't have reagents"
---
Agreed that reagents don't really mean much in this conversation, as both classes (and most classes) have to carry stuff.  The CD thing is garbage, but that's a sacrifice for being able to battle rez.
---
0/10 bait
---
Or CensusPlus is inaccurate.
---
Unfortunately I agree. I 100% don’t trust current blizzard to not fuck this up. In a perfect world I’d cream my jeans for classic+ but this team does not have the creativity to pull this off nor do I trust that they have the integrity to not shit it up with microtransactions and retail wow crap
---
Well, maybe you should stop looking for a server that fits you, and start trying to fit your server.
---
It seems this is PEBCAK issue.
---
Blizzard doesn't need to take advice from a less popular game developer
---
I'm in your exact boat here. I don't even care what people say, sub is fun as fuck and feels the most roguely to me.
---
First time I wiped in a dungeon I was braced for half the group to leave. No one bat an eye and we soldiered on like nothing happened. Most groups tend to stick around until everyone completes their quests because we all know how much of a pain they can be.
---
The structure of the game really does seem to promote patience.
---
Classic+ would be #changes, and I seriously wanna play WOTLK.
---
Easy way around it. Say your non-seasonal characters are on Herod. Season 1 starts. You make a new character on Herod-Seasonal. Namespace is shared with regular Herod. At the end of the season, whatever that is, Herod-Seasonal merges into Herod proper, and there are no conflicts because it was never an option.
---
Mage spotted :\^)
---
Sure, shamans seem like a better choice. Would 5 multi-boxed shamans beat 5 decent and individually played shamans in a team fight though?
---
I just took the boat to Theramore and walked up to Ratchet for the boat.  Took like 20 mins
---
I’ve had several alliance gank me that were 5 levels or higher than me. I just ran away. Being a priest is great
---
classic expansions &gt; classic+ &gt; true classic
---
I mean, Horde camp Nesingwary's camp among other places.
---
Its hard to explain it to people who haven't done it, just how infuriating it is.
---
I say warrior is shit tank for dungeons now. Bears and pallys all the way.
---
Yea this won’t happen. Look at old school runescape, the hype only lasted a few months. They won’t make dedicated servers for each expansion that would drastically cut the player base and every server would seem like a ghost town.
---
This essentially is what the lfg tool was in BC. I wish they would bring it back.
---
There's that whole KZ crypt area that seemed to be the foundations for a classic raid, it feels like there was a lot more content planned for vanilla that just got scrapped or used as an asset elsewhere.
---
Make it a ladder based system. Keep the classic as is, but introduce seasons.
---
At the end of the season, all characters get transfered to a battle grouped based server or servers to avoid population dwindling issues.
---
New servers get created at the beginning of every season, just like we just saw with individual communities.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
Classic+ 
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
Omar isn't a designer, and the Classic team really doesn't have quest designers on it apart from Ion consulting. So do you have faith in the current BFA designers? Because some of them would be making it.
---
Yep, I would just like to see them add actualy content, like dungeons, raids, world pvp objectives.
---
I don't want them to change the in game tools apart from I want better tooltips.
---
Wow classic+
---
I've never played the expansions though.. it would be cool to see what they were like
---
Frost has more cc and fire needs crit to really shine. That's all there is to it.
---
Welcome to the flamingo brotherhood my friend, [they grow up pretty fast](http://imgur.com/gallery/Pi1ArKX)
---
I was getting a warrior tank geared and was finally tanking a raid after exhausting my dungeon gear options. Half an hour of helping with the LFM later, I was kicked right before the raid was to start.
---
They found a warrior with +2 gear score on me. They wiped immediately because he was an idiot and the raid disbanded.
---
I quit playing very soon after that.
---
It is the leveling meta though.
---
Either the third one, or all of the above up to and including servers that don’t ducking reset ever. 
---
And I’d rather be set on fire than play an expansion that included flying originally but not now. WTF, Satan?
---
So really, all of the above would be best. I’m ready for my custom retail current world but LK is the big bad again. And not some bs new gender bent version, the one we had in world just scaled up.
---
I wouldn’t be interested in that, I   would like  to keep toons on ground.
---
Raptor strike spec
---
I'd wait until you're ready to chain-run dungeons, namely BRD. In my experience leveling with a holy priest on a pserver, it's really not *that* slow.
---
Sending gear upgrades and lvling  through rested exp. It's gonna be ok.
---
None of those?  
---
I’d be in favor of a new reset server for the people who for some reason hate yourselves and want to do this grind over and over but I’m in it to get back to Wrath and I don’t see a point in branching the population on to some weird layers of servers, I just want the treadmill to keep going.  
---
If there isn’t any future for BC and Wrath for the Classic server I’m on right now there is absolutely no point for me to play it at all.
---
I murder so many alliance in std and its only becouse I got ganked hard by alliance in hillsbrad...revenge some would say.
---
Ok so is it just wow this happens in or do you get the gradual slow down and lag in other games too?
---
the only path that seems really viable from an economic standpoint is classic+. 
---
true classic would be too stale, even with resets, to grow or even maintain a large enough player base to justify keeping the servers going. classic expansion would not only completely fragment the player base leading to serious population problems, but it would also become increasingly more expensive with each new set of servers coming online.
---
I just want to play my early Wrath Blood/Frost hybrid DK where I could off tank 25 man Patches without a healer on me and even be top damage.
---
Is that too much to ask?
---
Classic+ all day everyday
---
8) How is Blizz supposed to keep it running then? 
---
1. Inflation exists, 15$ today isn't what it was 14 years ago.
---
2. Classic wow most likely cannibalizes retail wow meaning that blizz isn't making more money from it.
---
3. Classic wow requires entirely new servers and devs (if only to maintain it.
---
The only solutions I can think of are
---
1. Higher subscription cost
---
2. Cosmetic cash shop
---
Tbh I get where you're coming from.  A cash shop ruins a lot of the "hard work" incentive. What's the point of working to get cool cosmetics when you could buy cooler stuff instead. But If you were to ask me to choose between classic wow with cash shop or no classic wow, I'd prob choose the cash shop version.
---
I got a fever , and the only cure is WOTLK expansion
---
[Just stop.](https://i.imgur.com/y8Ea8jB.gif)
---
GL rolling for the same Witchblade against 3 other mages though. Or the same RARE AS F\*\*K Drakestone of frozen wrath. Or for Firelord\`s necklace that all warlocks want too.
---
If people ***USED*** the damn things? 
---
YES. 
---
I would also be okay if they added one other thing from dungeon finder: Incentives for geared players to redo older stuff. 
---
That was one of the reasons playing on low pop servers was hell - no reason to go back, reducing the pool of players available on lower pop servers.
---
Lol
---
Every group always has its own unique Dynamic, and it was this way 15 years ago. You create the experience you want and you do that by having conversations with group members
---
Phase 3 is battlegrounds. Lots of people choose to create level 19 characters and cap their xp gain so they can think. That ring would be valuable for someone who wanted that item for their caster / healer for that purpose.
---
WoW caused the 2008 financial crisis.
---
I just want to live a peaceful zug zug
---
I was thinking you could kinda do that through set bonuses or like crazy class quest rewards. Some of the flavor of vanilla was bis stuff not being in the hardest content. Add a hard scarlet crusade 5 man or 10 man. That has some gear or set pieces that does some of what the 2.0 changes did? Idk
---
Classic + please. Flesh out more quest. Maybe more raids and dungeons but still capped at 60. Perhaps add in some more crafting recipes , maybe even jewelcrafting. But in a way that keeps everything “classic” still relevant. Each new expansion felt like it threw away everything that came before it.
---
We asked for a dungeon finder so we could be out in the world while lookoing for a group and not sit in a capital city. We never asked for it to include people for our battlegroups.
---
check out ADI Bags. It separates like items. section for quest items, consumables, trade items, junk ect. I use minimal mods too, but I really like that one.

Classic Loop
---
You know you've lost an argument when all you can do is post a gif reaction.
---
nah we don't need a radically new world. we just tweak the one we got. throw some new systems on top. refine some mechanics
---
FWIW if you want to be DPS and at the same time be in demand for leveling and groups pick mage or warlock. Mage especially. There’s so many people who want mages for aoe farming dungeons or also will specifically look for mages because they are vending machines
---
The first one, but no server or character reset. 
---
Instead, you would have the ability to play additional classes, like in FFXIV.
---
Prob, in 10 levels I can solo farm em as hunter if I wanted
---
this really is great. haha
---
finished it already? grats
---
Again, though, if you look at the comparison with OSRS and newer Runescape there are a lot of additions to the newer version that people don't like, and they're able to see that before voting for it in OSRS; it makes the more modern version like a laboratory for things to be added to the older version. Also, the way that the voting booth in Runescape works is that you're required to have a certain amount of accomplishment in the game before being able to vote, which keeps people who aren't as invested from requesting things that aren't necessarily beneficial, and without that requirement you could easily have an ignorant majority
---
To answer your question, no, Blizzard do not facilitate manual downloading of patches. In fact, virtually no online game does.
---
Ok so by this logic WotLK will have twice the subs of classic. You're not really seeking your idea well.
---
I try to do all of this but then the dps yell at me and say the dungeon is too easy and that we should just rush then stay start pulling and we wipe and then leave 🙄
---
I think that was then and Classic is now, though. It’s pretty clear to me, at this point, most people playing classic have been able to at least vaguely identify what makes it enjoyable.
---
I doubt a majority of players would be asking for many quality of life alterations or streamlining features in a classic+ addition. Personally, I’d want the devs to purposely continue to insert weird loot with weird itemization right alongside more obviously appropriate items. At least on my server it seems like these kinds of ideas are the norm.
---
They definitely might betray my trust, but right now I feel like the classic team knows whats up and I’d be fine giving them their shot. Worst case scenario is we all cry and get vanilla back again. I’m sure they’ve saved the game version this time lol
---
By the time I'm out of the mobs gigantic extendo-arm range, those 6 seconds are already up so there's not really a point in kiting.
---
I play a tank and I had a record slow day the other day where it took me almost 10 minutes to fill up a group. Tanks right now have a full party in less than one minute on average
---
dungeon finder didnt ruin classic numbnuts it was including people from other servers.
---
The bad player problem is pretty easily fixed by allowing people to ignore/blacklist others. As long as it remains single realm only, people who persistently misbehave get excluded.
---
Classic+ without any reuse of old expansions or bust.
---
Once servers reach the end of Vanilla should have an opt in to continue on a new horizons server. A lot of the fun was sucked out for me after knowing everything was compiled and reduced to a meta. An MMORPG needs to at least have the illusion of a future and an unknown. I played Project 1999 Everquest which is a "museum piece" for years but that doesn't translate to WoW because the end game here is instanced raiding that massively increases the rate of BiS capping, if raiding isn't truly competitive for a limited pool of targets then no one is truly special strutting around in the gear, it's just a matter of time (aka logging in at reset and never touching the game again). All the raid bosses should be contested world mobs in PvP Areas. WPVP needs to be  incentivized ala DAoC, if you want instanced raiding only 1 faction gets access and control shifts based on maintaining PvP dominance of the zone.  Allies need a PvP racial upgrade of course, as incentive to keep PvP servers from being horde dominated.
---
I wanted to play a game that still had the social aspects and felt like a world again.
---
Yes. I just posted something like this before reading the thread well. Yeah trinkets certain set bonuses and stuff would do well. Also I want that azshara bg
---
Cause the vast majority of them want to be Arms warriors and have NFC about tanking, or desire to do so... They seen videos of streamer MS/OP/Whirlwind crit explosions and they want to be that unstoppable juggernaught. 
---
Unfortunately they don't realize they need a guild who respects them to gear them and pocket healers if they're going to tear up the field like that. 
---
The rest of us who lived classic wow are doing what it takes. Sure I'm specced enhancement but I'll heal the shit out of some dungeons.
---
Honestly only reason why it can be bad to constantly reroll is that you might get burned out and never reach 60 if you start again and again.
---
Yeah a lot of it comes down to looting too, the only fair way is group loot but that means you have to "double loot" to get all the quest items causing either additional downtime or missed quest items or usually both.
---
It depends on what you want to do. For PvP I think it's worth it, because you have everything from gnomes (except world enlarger and gnome teleporter) and goblin, and you can make the goblin sapper charges and mortar for bombing.   
---
I'll definitely do it that way.
---
That is the healer's job.
---
Only egotistical divas just 'let dps die'
---
I’m 18, I missed classic. I never got to experience it and now that I can play it with my dad (who I watched play it growing up) I’m having a blast and would prefer to stick with no changes and then go ahead into BC classic, and experience the more balanced class design and honestly the most interesting expansion of wow.
---
I feel bad cus it always takes me a few seconds to notice I've been buffed, and by then theyve ran past me and I can't give them that sweet fort buff.
---
Every single person that hates dungeon finder is some TBC or later scub that thinks they know what was good/bad in classic and now we have this garbage game
---
Well i now have money and autonomy on how to manage my time, I freelance so I make my own schedule :)
---
As a kid I was playing WotLK on a laptop with a basic gpu that averaged like 30 fps.  I've made a few upgrades since then, life is good.
---
&gt; It's all being ran on the same hardware
---
There's no way that's true. Each layer will be on it's own virtual machine. We're a decade past those blades they auctioned off.
---
&gt;Layers just split those X amount of players into groups of Y. If you have 20000 players, the layers just split them into groups of 2000 (so 10 layers). If you cut it to 5 lets it's just groups of 4000. It doesn't cut the population down to 10000.
---
That's not how it works though. The first X thousand to log on will be placed into layer 1. Then once it hits the limit, the realm will create a new layer and put the second X thousand onto it, until it hits the maximum number of layers. Then it will send everybody else into the queue.
---
NO. I just got my Orgimmar back. Don't touch it.
---
It's not like they are making your gameplay worse. If you like playing with people who quest then do it.
---
I personally couldn't get it to work :'( idk if others have or not
---
I never cared for arena, thb...
---
If it lets you cast another blizzard than you originally would’ve been able to (and if the stam kept you alive in a situation you would’ve otherwise died in) it would add quite a bit don’t you think?.. if you have +30 frost damage (generous for lower levels) and it adds like +1 damage per tick I’d much rather take having another blizzard cast from the extra int over that.  Wouldn’t you?
---
I mean, on Bloodsail I've only seen one or two instances where it spammed out actual advertisements. Yeah there's plenty of unrelated talk, but I haven't felt it impacts finding groups at all. I tend to find them at the same rates regardless. 
---
The problem on Bloodsail I find is there's so few people actually IN LookingForGroup that you're far better off whispering random people or using /1 depending on the dungeon.
---
I havent played retail in years I have no idea.
---
Id love to eventually see some classic only content. Stay at level 60 and never add fkying mounts to the game. New content is fine as long as core mechanics stay the same.
---
Would love to see the class balancing updates. Namely just the weak underused specs buffed. Druids, pally ret and prot etc.
---
Ultimately I think they should run player polls though for any content.
---
This would be the ideal situation for them to then introduce Warcraft 4. Then have retail and Warcraft 4 function as a sort of zelda parallel timeline situation.
---
Winning need rolls and passing I've heard of. Never heard of passing after lucky greeds.
---
I highly doubt I'm the only one. Greed is greed, I doubt most people even check who wins a greed roll unless it's a big ticket item.

Oh man I'm not sure how comfortable you are on camera but WoW Ironman is for sure something I'd watch. That has be the best way for watching someone grind be exciting.

Classic + is really appealing i just dont know how why could do it. Like with naxx gear alot of the classes became ridiculous in pvp even against equaly geared players. Hence resilience. Further expansions would only amplify this more. Classic expansion would be awesome if they had fresh severs starting up say everymonth. Then you can pop into a servers at a point in a timeline you would like to experience again. That would be sick

Oh man that’s disheartening... we’re going to try it this afternoon. Will report back
---
That's a terrible argument though. With that logic, companies should never make more than one game since they don't want people to stop playing their first game.
---
How does this work?
---
I love Vanilla , but for me when I think "classic" I think TBC. It was when the game peaked for me personally in PVE and PVP, that doesn't mean the game hasn't gotten more complex, but the scale felt right. They introduced a ton of features and really fleshed out the raiding system so you didn't have to only raid as 40 (I know there were 20 mans in Vanilla but TBC improved on it).
---
For me I'm hopeful that they eventually do push it towards TBC.
---
This seems to not be exploitable at all...
---
40 mount is free for warlocks, but we do also have to buy skills for our demons. That being said I use the spell way more than summon?
---
Id love for the expansions without the bullshit simplification of the game.
---
Yeah, honestly I quit wow for most of BC.  My 40 man raiding guild fell apart at Kara, bunch of stupid drama, and so I just fell out of it.
---
Came back a couple months before Wrath when everyone was pugging Kara, and ZA, and Mag...
---
But that isn't how vanilla worked. In vanilla it would automatically log you in to the last server you were logged in to. To get to a different server you had to click the Change Realm button.
---
That can be adjusted. Lots of quests required flying blunts in WotLK but were limited in area and only did damage to quest mobs.
---
Find a private 3.3.5 server. They're still out there.
---
Blizzard broke the api so castbar addons cant tell what rank of spell an enemy is casting. Because of that, they assume it is the max rank that is being cast. If the enemy is actually casting a lower rank that has a shorter cast time, the castbar addon will not display correctly.
---
Then that sounds good. I honestly dont remember that much about tbc. Was so long ago and I haven't really played wow in a few years. I just know it became a sprint through dungeon fest and you could go hours without anyone even saying a word, or if they did it was usually to be toxic. Really kind of killed it for me. 
---
So if that is what tbc had, that would be awesome.
---
thicc orc booty :P
---
lol no.

30 isn't generous if you're stacking frost damage LOL also you're not going oom before shits dead.  you're braindead plz stop talking to me

For those who think that TukUI/ElvUI are too much like myself, I recommend dominos. Minimal, customizable, easy to use. It’s like dependable Honda (Dominos) va fancier and sexier but not as hackable Tesla (ElvUI/TukUI)
---
Free realm transfers are only from certain servers to certain servers. You don’t get to pick. 
---
So the only way to play with them is to reroll on their server.
---
C+ don’t change talents, only new items for new raids
---
Ya seems like a nice guy honestly lol. He even ended your little convo with an awesomely cringe worthy pun.
---
IMO all 3 would be best.
---
**Classic** for those who love the base game - Private servers prove this. It could function in some way like diablo 3 seasons, EG: reset every 6 months but keep previous chars on another classic server? Eventually they can reduce the amount of servers once hype dies down and they introduce content into the other options.
---
**Classic+** would provide the perfect opportunity to standardize the timeline events to then publish Warcraft 4. They could then control new events content etc in relation to both games (creating a sort of zelda timeline between retail and classic+/Warcraft 4).
---
**Classic expansions** \- for that nostalgia feeling. I myself couldn't afford internet and subscription as a new teen therefore i missed out on the feels. I do want to experience everything that everyone else did, the good and the bad.
---
The option of staying with each expansions individual server (and to actually exist independently) is a massive ask of Blizzard and i don't think they would ever do that. That would be splitting their player bases massively - infighting over which expansion is best, which to stay with - which expansion deserves the higher resources (servers etc), what QOL do that include what do they not? I dont see it working out unless they were able to MTX each version. Not sure how they would market or get people to actually buy old content unless they were able to revamp and re-brand each expansions as new classic versions/instances of themselves.
---
Someone above said WoW2, but i think that would transition into Classic+. All i am hoping is with all the new hype we can get a Warcraft 4 :D
---
it's against ToS? we use it on retail multiple times in a dungeon, its ajusted with CVR scripts.. that means every single nameplate addon is breaking TOS?
---
Why would you not auto loot it?
---
Assuming it's true, I think it would be the last.  Where do you go from there.  Burning legion is gone, void gods would be dealt with.  Not much left to do after that after that.
---
I just want new hard level 60 raids with side grade gear for off specs
---
Ugh yuck, i hated what they did to most of the classes in tbc
---
Yeah it's a nightmare, but it didn't stop me from going 22-30 mostly there...
---
Either they don't touch it at all, or release expansion on separate servers and don't touch the Classic at all.
---
I wouldn't mind additional post Naxx content. But it has to not break progression, not add another .5 tier and generally be only available to those who are done with all the other content. Considering how small the audience would be, let's stick to let the Classic be Classic.
---
Made this same post on forums was not givin any good feedback glad to see Reddit is better
---
Blizzard hates revealing player numbers/sub numbers etc. They prefer players are kept in the dark as much as possible. We know they want to turn off layering though, and we know there's 3 to 4x too many players on full realms so they need to do something obviously.  
---
[I posted about this yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2w73k/get_ready_for_more_queues/) but people just hate reality I guess.
---
So weird to say people saying they want LFG which is the original Dungeon Finder.

Hi, /u/scooby0143

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d3iv3w/omg_look_how_cute_he_is/). 
---
Pickpocket every humanoid in general. Not necessary when doing stocks runs as pick pockets in there are about 50c to 1s.
---
Solo stocks runs are you stealthing through the dungeon until you find a room with a chest, you clear the room and open the chest. You also make a macro for targeting the rare (Bruegal). You then kill Bruegal and his usual 1 add. Rinse repeat. You can do a reset of the dungeon 5 times per hour. There is a minimum of one Solid Chest and a usual maximum of a Solid Chest and a Large ironbound chest which you can open if you have high enough lockpicking.
---
&gt;BC was a 2x stat inflation, WOTLK was a 10x stat inflation, so was cataclysm.
---
Other than flying and phasing (whether cata-style quest phasing, Cross-realm zones, or other iterations) for ruining WPVP.
---
Removing 40 man raids is what killed wow for me. If they tuned expansions to work with 40 man raids I'd be in board, but otherwise just keep it as vanilla.
---
Don't listen to all the people telling you to use thistle tea or blind. That stuff gets expensive fast. 
---
Blind is great for when the you get your guy down to 10% and a healer shows up looking to wreck your fun. 
---
For most classes you want to open with cheap shot right before your energy ticks. (if you don't have an add-on to see the energy ticks you should get one)
---
Then you sinister strike once followed by a gouge. 
---
You want to let them sit in the full gouge. This lets you pool more energy. Right as gouge is breaking you want to sinister strike again. 
---
Now at this point whatever instant cc they have will get through. Scatter shot, priest fear, death coil etc. Normally you have to eat it. It's ok because your still regenerating energy.  Now you can do 5 point kidney shot or if they are low enough try to finish them off with eviscerate. 
---
Things deviate more from here but that's a solid way to start most fights.
---
Imma place this here... https://youtu.be/0mwVv6e0ovM
---
This will explain something that could very well CHANGE wow for the better.
---
Well thats cool, but the main character I play is technically (but race changed) from vanilla WoW so it has seen it all, and no distinction is made between characters to they are one in the same. Its the whole world being the main character, not the player which made WoW great and I hope we see a return to that.
---
Please, no Burning Crusade...I have PTSD from BC and would definitely quit if they brought it back.
---
That's really useful to know if I'm doing 93.3921934945 dps instead of 93.3921934944 if I use my other spell.
---
Did you play 15 years ago? b/c I did but it feels like I'm playing with people who are 15 years old. I'm not 15 and maybe that's my issue. IDK. I have conversations all the time but it just turns into "memes" or a meta I have no idea about. If I ask a question, most of the time, I get a petty answer, or at least that's what it seems like.
---
I feel like Classic Plus would be awesome but also would classic and the expansions. Alll stand alone but transferable( obviously forward through timeline) would be great too. I still feel like Wrath of the Lich King was the absolute version of World of Warcraft but that's Imo.
---
Uhhh you pressing "Accept friend request" is what enabled him to do so, Not Blizzard
---
They aren't...
---
It’s going to be classic+ n this is when theyll finally hike up the sub cost
---
Probably less than 10% are doing it that way. You will always have power-levelers breaking intended design in any game. It can't be avoided. Most of us are just enjoying the world.
---
42 human warrior here, no issues other than a turned in quest saying i can still turn it in, but thats usually fixed with a relog.
---
Even then I think Legion would genuinely be agreed by most people to be a fantastic expansion albeit one to a completely different game than BC and Vanilla were.
---
TROUT

I'm 30 and I'm beating every warrior above my level without a sweat. Nothing you can do without a dispel really.

I’m a little drunk and a hunter and I was susceptible enough to be like “okay yeah that’s good advice” till about number 4
---
Lets see if the panther cage in 1k needles works... or if we can find one underwater...
---
It does. The huntard moniker exists for a reason. It’s not just haha memes can every class have shit players? Absolutely no one argues that, but hunters have a high concentration of shit players. Probably because that’s the class everyone suggest for new players.

---
Yo I was wondering how not a single person but you mentioned that.
---
this is how i was able to do it
---
True classic would be great but would cause the highest number of QQ
---
It would essentially be like Diablo 3, wouldn't it? And so eventually players will ask why they are bothering to play a second/third/fourth time unless different gear is released. 
---
At which point you'd get something akin to classic+ but with no expansions. Just classic with different meta
---
I think were all in agreement here, classic+ by far
---
What do you mean he did nothing wrong? He was rolling need on BoEs saying it was for alts. Of course that's wrong, it's bullshit.
---
Classic+ is the only way. Stick to the core as much as is possible.
---
I loved vanilla, but I had so much fun with TBC. It was hands down the best timeline in WoW IMO. That said, I keep classic going for at least 2 years before doing something with it.
---
[Meanwhile, on Pagle...](https://media.giphy.com/media/2dwejHC0H3mta/giphy.gif)
---
Also would have been a clusterfuck of re balancing issues and playerbase criticism.
---
I also used to be a clicker. Hell, when I started playing overwatch the only FPS game id ever played was the halo series on Xbox. So, naturally, as I played overwatch on PC I used an Xbox controller. I could play the game. Some games I’d get gold medals. Then I switched to mouse and keyboard and while it was rough to adjust at first, it was night and day what you were able to do. 
---
The same is with keyboard vs. mouse turning in wow. There’s a reason it’s ridiculed. Switch, you won’t regret it.
---
I’m fine with them keeping the same story lines up to Cata, but it would be cool if they made the game subsist on community interaction and they take a different approach then in the past when balancing the game.
---
There is no option to add someone from the opposite faction on PVP servers.
---
He is using an addon.
---
To prevent splitting your player base, classic+
---
The milk slays it
---
Classic+ expansions. Release a classic inspired BC but in order to compete with mobs in hellfire you need at least mid tier classic gear so its not irrelevant. People say they cant do that because it means less and less people play newer content but classic is already niche
---
I only started tanking during Cata (with a hiatus during WoD, where I mained as mage) but until BFA, I was consistently racking up major DPS as a tank (Prot War).
---
In fact, I was typically top deeps in 5-mans, and top-5 in 25-mans.
---
(Disclaimer: I usually did not play at top tier (mythic or equivalent))
---
Classic plus sounds great. The Wow that could have been.
---
Surely even if they do classic+ and people hate it then they can just release TBC anyways.
---
Because everyone wants some changes, just minor ones, but if everyone gets their wish then the changes would become major.
---
I imagine a lot of people have more trust that they can pull it off, considering most people expected them to botch it completely.
---
That, and anyone enjoying it needs to come to terms with the fact that it feels new again because it's been so long, but there *is* an end to the content. Only a fraction of people saw it on release because Naxxramas lasted like a month or two before the expansion dropped. But what happens when AQ is done, Naxx is on farm by most major guilds on any given server, and there's no more quests to discover or do?
---
Even adding back features like Achievements would probably not piss too many people off, but can only extend the content so far.
---
Even if you work expansion content in somehow, that ends, too. And if you just add them as they were added before, it invalidates a lot of the earlier content. The game just becomes 1-80 + Naxx through Icecrown, and I bet even half of that can be skipped with some gear drops in the later dungeons. This was the era where Blizzard started doing convenience drops to get people to see more content, but what they want *now* is to draw the content out in the spirit of the original game.
---
Which means you *need* to make some changes. If not to pacing, then to tuning. Thankfully, I think people will be more welcoming to changes made to expansion content if it's to bring the design philosophy in-line with the original release.
---
But Blizzard only has, what, a year or two to decide how to proceed once they run out of initial content? Or maybe they'll be lazy and just have servers reset on occasions like EverQuest does. But it would be a shame not to have at least one server with "new" content in some form. If it bombs, it bombs, and everyone can go back to playing on the other servers.
---
Classic is based on a patch where powerleveling was nerfed into oblivion, if i remember correctly.
---
I would mix 2 and 3 personally. That best describes what Jagex did with OSRS, and, while it isn't perfect, that game is doing great right now....like, left-RS3-in-the-dust levels of great.
---
Retail is not classic. Classic it is not intended for you to be able to see plates past 20 yards. The scripts that do so are breaking ToS. There's been discussion about it all over the place. They gonna ban people? No. They just did exactly what everyone expected.... Hot fixed it and broke the scripts. Enjoy.
---
It took away from world PVP. If everyone is on the ground, then lots of little skirmishes that can turn into epic battles have the chance to start. But if you get ganked and then can stealthily rez and fly up real fast, that's the end of that. It also makes the world emptier with less people on the ground.
---
Are the notes public, or private to the individual who creates the notes?
---
Implement a Runescape idea where the community can decide what to and what not to put in the game.

Gotta have the maximum edge over others for those tasty DKPs.

I think it's been mentioned a couple of times. But what about seasons? Something similar to that of path of exile.

No idea how to implement. Could they implement something like a procedurally generated dungeon or randomness similar to bloodborne.  or introduction of a world pvp battle zone similarly to wotlk

Or what about Chromie send us back in further. Somewhere pre hyjal

Demo shout is broken for threat. Supposedly they are fixing it. No idea if they did or not yet.
---
Option one or two.
---
1. The logical progression. We wanted Classic, it's a safe bet for us and Blizzard. Let it run it's course and then we can focus on a new Blizzard product.
---
2. This sounds nice in theory, but the reality is I'll likely be distracted by other things in two years. The weight of the nostalgia, while not the sole motivator for me playing Classic, will be gone. It's risky for both Blizzard and the players - there might not be enough of us to stick around, or, they might just fuck it up again.
---
3. As much as I might want this, no. Too many people will peel out - either folks like me who have BC and WotLK more recently in their memory - or people that get sick of Blizzard selling nostalgia back to them. At this point players would really have to ask themselves - are we okay with Blizzard selling us the same shit? Where do we go from here?
---
Similar experience,  but i finally bit the bullet at level 28 and fixed my mis-clicked talent error. It was affecting my mental state for too long...
---
STV is only so bad because of the high pop of alliance and horde. 
---
Desolace would be even worse for alliancr
---
You have to loot each mob twice if someone is done with the quest. Certain quests drop bop whites that people in your group can autoloot multiple copies of. You gotta run for loot if youre killing different mobs far away from eachother and get the other persons loot.
---
I’ve been saying for a while that I basically want the class design of BC but in the Vanilla world. As it stands right now there are several classes that end up being pigeonholed in raids because there’s only one really viable spec, and that’s frustrating because the talent trees are *great* and add so much depth and I want to be able to explore that.
---
Also, dual spec. I know respeccing is supposed to be a gold sink, but having two specs is fun. Make dual spec cost like 1,000 gold and it’s still a gold sink but it gives people options to really experiment and play builds they love.
---
You fool... caring about that... when you could have a flamingo...
---
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay.
---
That is not what he said in his post?
---
None of these. Make a new class if you think it's getting stagnant. And if you play that much that you get bored you need to revaluate life and maybe your playing too many video games. I want this game for the way it is. But yes I'd enjoy a flying mount.
---
Well thank you, that still works, im just not smart enough about macros to have added the shift modifier into it as a way to cancel.
---
Just reading how you have that written makes me think i way overdid my other macros as i have them written to cancel each form seperatly instead just encompassing all of them with just.
---
/cancelform
---
What about both? Follow the story of BC, but change the dynamics. Maybe no flying mounts (at least not permanent ones), no group finder, etc. Also, the could learn from past mistakes in regards to talents/gear optimization and try fresh no routes there.
---
yes, but most dont look after requesting a specific location
---
It feels like that because that's what your current experience has been. But every time you log on you meet new people, you meet different people.
---
Your experience meeting and putting together the community experience you want will be different this time than it was last time. It will require more effort.
---
Works lower level but now that I’m the upper 30’s I’ve been using SM elites outside the dungeon. Switched weapons and basically auto attack and reddit while I wait for the skill up
---
They'd probably do something like Diablo 2 or Path of Exile, your character isn't deleted, it just go in the "normal" servers, you can decide to stay there or make a new character in a new ladder/league.
---
How about remove shards and then we gonna take it from there. Really spoils my fun with vanilla so far.
---
I think he is meaning a game more like Smite. Though Smite sucked because it didn't have good mechanics. It was a moba where you controlled your character like a 3rd person instead of RTS godmode view.
---
Yeah I'm not going to lie, I do want to experience TBC again. However, this is where the destruction of WoW started.
---
Druid has more armor mitigation, though.
---
Classic+ would be amazing
---
Or just be arms
---
At this point I thought the jumping language covered all scenarios
---
Classic+, look how well the same concept worked out for OSRS.
---
As of now, have free action pots, have grenades, have bandages, maybe a health pot, and at no time mess anything up. If you’re a gnome, chances go up even more.
---
THIS! Hell even a pally can make an great tank, played by the right people.
---
One of the best feelings is being able to easily kill enemies you once had a problem with. For example: the “kill 15 harvesters” in Westfall quest was really difficult at level 12 but returning later to help out a friend at level 30 is so much fun to just buzz through them all
---
Come to think of it, I do recall that too somewhat, but that was one of the issues that Blizz said they had to deal with to make Classic work with the bnet launcher. Because of the streamline mechanism in the launcher, the manual update method is no longer workable.
---
Is that the Something Awful Goon Squad from back in vanilla?
---
People forgot that classic is a grinding game despite all the quests. That's why drop rates are low and kill counts are high. The vast majority of our exp comes from killing.
---
Woah. This is next level haha
---
It only seems like a good idea if you've never played MMOs before. As someone who did, I can assure you that the infamous "public queue" consistently provides the worst gaming experience. You're potentially playing with people who may not be aware of the chat or who disabled it (something that shouldn't even be possible in a mmo), you're playing with people generally uninterested in doing their best because getting in a dungeon takes no effort, you will be grouped with people unaware of how the game works since you're not travelling across the world to get the quests that give you some of the best progression gear.
---
If you have issues finding groups, be part of the solution and start your own. Alternatively, create a new character and play a tank warrior, there's always demand for that.
---
I would like Classic plus if they did tweak some classes. Ret paladins and Moonkin should be competitive DPS and prot pally should be a viable tank as well as feral, etc. I also loved BC and Wrath so I would totally be on board for re-relases of those. My most fond WoW memories are from that era and I loved the raids, tier sets, the whole aesthetic of Bc/Wrath.
---
And nobody in these ego threads care about the difference between wiping and keeping a dps alive. They want to let dps die to 'teach a lesson' or some shit.
---
I want to hang out in Duskwood once my undead is high enough level, but not to gank people. I just love the zone and want to make it even more paranoia-inducing by spooking lowbies. It was done to me way back, lol
---
I always try to find a mage to Int buff me while I level my weapon skill, I think it makes a big difference.
---
This is the greatest edit I’ve ever seen
---
Love Will of the Forsaken + R1 Frostbolt
---
I miss me some old school dunkey.
---
I never think about mana as a warlock
---
It's always about health - lifetap gives more mana than it takes health, so you should never have mana issues
---
Maybe I'm just too low a level for it to matter yet, but between my dots and the succubus damage, I am reliably able to take out mobs before they chunk me too much
---
Because of demonskin you have better regen and therefore less downtime than most casters.
---
Magistrate Burnside. Did it tonight. Luckily I was sitting in the chair on the “stage” in the town hall and Burnside spawned on top of me so I was able to get the tag before the rogue who ran in and tried stealing him.
---
LFG tool straight in it\`s current retail form. EZ gaem ruined.
---
Classic + but with horizontal gear progression, dont keep making items stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger, just make them a normal powerlevel and different.
---
Elvui, caster dps as base profile.
---
They were going to do this at one point, then they scrapped it and the assets became Overwatch.
---
Dual spec was WotlK
---
Have you tried your add-ons one at a time to see if any unexpectedly also track this?
---
there are always people around who are immature in game
---
they were there 15 years ago and they're there today and they'll be there 15 years from now
---
you sometimes gotta stick it out and look past them to make the experience you want
---
I don't think WoW has the playerbase to split them 3+ times into expansion realms to be honest. Classic+ seems like the only option for foward movement despite how skeptical I am of Blizzard being able to keep their lazy design shortcuts out of it.
---
Classic+ or remodeling retail to have more classic like elements.
---
&gt;burning crusade is the first wow I played 
---
&gt;burning crusade was peak wow
---
Fuck off dude you didn’t even play vanilla how can you make that judgment
---
Just wait till Nvidia gets RTX working for Classic WoW.
---
No really, just wait. With the hype surrounding Classic, and their previous forays with Minecraft and Quake, I think it's really likely they might work something up. Might even get me to consider a 20XX GPU.
---
I hit level 40 today. Wondering what's the best way to grind out my mount money? Any spots in particular that drop good stuff?
---
Much of what was added in tbc to make all specs 'viable' was lame and boring.  I'd rather see them take a fresh crack at it more in the spirit of classic.
---
In my opinion resilience doesn't ruin pvp, it ruins the game. It detracts from the RPG elements so significantly. In classic the good gear is just good gear. Some items are certainly better for pvp situations but the items you earn as pvp rewards can be really good in pve content and the items you earn as pve rewards can be good in pvp content. That is why resilience ruined the game in my opinion.
---
I’m on zul’jin and only see a few people at any given time. It’s rare to see more than a few in a day.
---
The only parts of TBC and Wotlk I don't want to see are dungeon finder and flying mounts.
---
Remove those two things and wow will be like it was in it's prime, yet so much better.
---
Which does nothing against crushing blows or attacks that could outright be parried/blocked.
---
Plus your healer has to work harder keeping you healed because you take damage no matter what.
---
One of the core philosophies of vanilla WoW was making players rely on each other. Warlock summons are a big part of that. It's also why vendor food/water is ungodly expensive (to promote depending on mages.) Summoning stone was a mistake in hindsight.
---
Wotlk was indeed very good and Ulduar is the best raid of all time.  
---
My problem with WotLK is the multiple difficulties on raid, Naxxx being so easy and dungeons being a joke (the theme of the dungeons was amazing and the art team was awesome, but heroic dungeon were so easy compared to TBC or early Cata).  
---
I love Ulduar, what an amazing Raid 10/10.
---
Really? I was certain they got added in after they removed the legendary necklace thing, in a later patch.
---
Solo grinding between quest areas is for sure better for 95% of players if they want efficiency.
---
Is the bear on crack?
---
My close friends all dragged me in the shit hole that is stalaag. Didnt have a choice really. Guess I'll heal my way to lvl 60.
---
I just prefer alliance. Im a raider. I avoid pvp if I can. I started in vanilla as Alliance. I’ve tried horde... its just not the same. Plus night elf is my favorite race.
---
Lets be thankful OP took a real screenshot 👍🏻
---
The way I see that is that it's just converted into an outdoor raid. Cut it right down but you can do a tour of some memorable bits. Make Felreaver a boss and etc. Then that leads straight into Black Temple which you just retune for lvl 60 Classic.
---
That way we still put the portal to use (it's literally a raid entrance), we still go to outland and resolve that, we get to do Black Temple which is a win for Blizz as development is mostly done and everyone gets a little nostalgia dip.
---
This.  Make it take place during Warcraft 1 2 and 3.
---
Even on retail I've never been able to level an ally. I'm a member of the horde, nothing more nothing less.
---
I can guarantee this is an unpopular opinion on this sub but I actually thought Legion was the best WoW expansion to date.
---
Warrior and Rogue are prob about equal or higher
---
no i haven't. I will try it shortly. Just wanted to see if it was kind of a known issue.
---
the only thing that I don't like about TBC is flying mounts. besides this, TBC is the best era of WOW by far.
---

Hey if you are still looking, Nevermore is looking to add another rogue to our roster. We have an extensive PvP core of players who have hit rank 15 and we also have a team for raids, with our first raid being October first. We raid T/W 9-12 EST. If we sound fun to you, you can fill out an app @  www.nevermorenation.com/wowapp 
---
\-Xiled
---
The link shows warriors/rogues primarily on top soooo...
---
Either Classic+ or a WoW2 that holds very true to the classic play style.
---
I think it'd be cool if they go through to the end of Wotlk then reset the servers and just end up doing seasons like Diablo. Of course if they do that they should probably start telling people now.
---
There used to be a glitch where hunter's pets would appear with their original name and size, including elite/rare portrait if they had one before taming. 
---
But probably what you saw was just a level 10 on their taming quests, the wild mobs you temporarily tame for it don't shrink in size like proper hunter pets.
---
I'd LOVE to replay Wrath, but I also am very interested in what could be done with Classic+.  I know there are zones and progressions that didn't ship with Vanilla or make it into future expansions.  I'd like to see what those could be.
---
Yeah, classic plus. It would be like classic but enhancement shamans actually deal damage.
---
I agree with this. Leave Naxx out longer before you open the dark portal, release Karazan as a sort of "ZG equivalent, 25-man catch up raid", and then release outlands rescaled to level 60 with modifications to make it accessible without flying.
---
Or be undead...and eat them.
---
Sorry what spams chat?
---
stop please u dnt knw wht ur tlking bout
---
You present your video as a low level Hpal guide but you barely give any good advices,
---
Yea polls aren’t their strongsuit but if blizzard wants to take something from jagex when it comes to classic+ it should be publishing dev blogs detailing the future and taking feedback based on the dev blogs
---
That's the vendor trash everyone starts with
---
40+ gets into the territory that nobody would vote in lower level content on the excuse "because it would take too much dev time for dead content" that people throw around all the time in OSRS.
---
This is highlighting classic server pop vs retail pop... During a downtime in retail vs release of classic. Let's check again after classic has been out a while (between phases) and retail has a new patch release.
---
If you play more then her maybe level her account up for her sometime.
---
Yeah they present three choices, none of which result in you continuing to play Classic with your character.
---
```A wild Thistle Boar appears!```
---
They can try. I’m a 60 rogue. They won’t know im there till they attack an ally. Then its murder time.
---
So level as shadow? Until BRD or Strat level 50+ dungeons, you really don't need to be holy spec to heal. You miss out on like, holy nova by not going holy, that's pretty much it, you have all the other utility and things you need to heal just by leveling up and learning them at the skill trainer.
---
Classic+ I want it done just like Old School RuneScape
---
It's only worse in retail where you can mass pull pretty much every other dungeon
---
!remindme 16 hours
---
I'm already level 39 so was just curious if it was worth switching to farm for the mount.
---
And what does it mean ??
---
Never got to play bc so that would be cool
---
Blizz definitely ruined some things all on their own. Random legendarily you have to run tons of dungeons for a tiny chance at rolling the best one? AP grinding? Massive increase in the addictive skinner box aspects of the game?
---
Server resets? Fuck that. None of those sound appealing. 
---
If anything, I'd like to see them do a Classic+ with the ideas they had for original Classic, but fleshed out. I'd mainly just want to see the Azshara Battleground if I'm honest and it'd be neat to see a cool Grim Batol raid. Grim Batol got done dirty in Cataclysm. Such a relevant location and all it is there for is some meh dungeon.
---
Rewarding. The in game interactions reinforces the mmo feel that Classic radiates.
---
We got reports that someone’s gettin high and drunk playing space in the street...
---
Think he just mailed all his other gold to another toon to perfectly get 69g 69s 69c? Or coincidence??
---
When the trees start speaking orcish
---
They should run different servers for expansion and leave Classic it's own game
---
Nah I'm on Bigglesworth
---
Hey if you are still looking, Nevermore is looking to add another priest to our roster. We have an extensive social aspect in our guild, including PvPers who love to chill and just have a good time and we also have a team for raids, with our first raid being October first. We raid T/W 9-12 EST. If we sound fun to you, you can fill out an app @ [www.nevermorenation.com/wowapp](http://www.nevermorenation.com/wowapp)
---
Also this may be an unpopular opinion but if they just scrapped flying mounts altogether it would've been better.
---
I'm a noob what's a twink item
---
If they could make level 60 versions of TBC raids, that would rock. I love me some Karazhan.
---
I really want to go to TBC. That said there's no reason it has to be classic plus or expansions. Once they reach the end of vanilla they could release a bit of originally cut content, then after a bit release TBC.
---
I'm well aware of that but if he's 30 yards away biting some critter and a rogue pops out he's no help for a few seconds, I know this is the whole point of rogues I'm just asking what I can do to combat it
---
Can you think of a racial that offers a warrior more than breaking a frost nova?
---
Yes, all that spirit and intellect really helps them :)
---
Well, this is how the world ends. Just like them listening to the loud voices on the original forums to make bad changes, enough people are going to say this nonsense and ruin everything.
---
Classic official wotlk server is my lifetime dream
---
This is outrageously useful
---
IDC. Just stop at lIch King this time, PLEASE.
---
What stops wotlk from being the peak?
---
I had just read online about how Prot was second best tank behind warrior, which I always found quite boring, so going paladin to tank sounded like a fair choice.
---
Yeah thats the thing.  Wotlk had the best talents and class mechanics out of any xpac
---
you can counter this by just being in a constant state of turning with right click
---
Any help while I'm still LVL 30?
---
Oh I fully knew. Just world first means "First ever kill" Not "First kill this time around."
---
Cata was amazing imo but it brought a shit ton of stuff that ruined the game with it. I personally believe that the new world revamp and LFR were disastrous for the games future. The revamp a lot more so than LFR
---
You shived him after though right? You didn't just let the enemy walk away, right?
---
I wasn’t being sarcastic. Some Staves have ridiculous DPS, particularly at lower level before the more popular options are obtainable.
---
I have thought about how this might work out quite a bit.  I think there are still a couple talent specs that could be tweaked slightly--the obvious ones being Retribution and Protection for Paladins and Balance for Druids.  I would want them to try to mostly use design principles from vanilla and not to plunder mechanics from later expansions.  I would love for enhancement shaman not to be a weird meme spec at 60.
---
I would also be interested in adding unique pieces of gear that could make for interesting playstyles for classes that already enjoy a good experience in vanilla (e.g. I had an idea for a unique fist weapon that would have a Chance-on-hit proc that would increase shield block value, perhaps parry, as well, for deep protection warriors to have the old "dual shields" meme fun.)
---
Clearly that’s why you get dazed when hit from behind
---
Warmane is really good.
---
Please post a link if you find it, sounds like a good laugh
---
#1 really depends on you. Being a low pop won't make raiding more difficult imo. I played on private servers maxing out at 3k players and there were at least 5 hardcore raid guilds on each faction with many more casual raid guilds. Que time a question we don't have an answer to. You may switch realms and a month from now the realm you switch to may have the same que or no que. If your consistently dealing with 3 hour+ ques and have no friends or anything tying you to the server I would switch personally.
---
#2. It said till the 16th when I checked last.
---
Dual spec was WotLK. it was added in 3.1 alongside Ulduar.
---
Classic+, and TBC split the community and have separate realms. maybe TBC+ or WotLK down the line
---
That dude has no idea wht the fuck he's talking about. Ret paladins want the slowest weapon possible and you should basically have command up 100% of the time. But listen yo, if you play a ret paladin you're going to get hazed. A lot. It's a spec that people hate becUse it does low dmg and to noobs dmg = skill. You will have a hard time getting into dungeon groups and stuff if you arent willing to heal as well. And like i said, you're gonna get hazed. A lot. 
---
But that guy was a dumbass. No clue what he's talking about
---
I don't think it needs progression or server resets. It should remain as is for the people who want to play for years to come.
---
I think they should just release new burning crusade and wotlk servers (and potentially allow character transfers).
---
Lay traps.
---
so many of the messes people get into in dungeons are the result of not taking the time to mark targets and set a kill order.  if he does that you should be fine.  even if you do it, tell the cc classes who to cc, assign a kill order that the tank and dps can follow together, make reasonable pulls so he doesn’t have to tank 6 mobs at once.  sadly too many are still in retail mode, and don’t take the time to do this even though they are under-leveled and under-geared for the dungeon.   Note:  this only becomes relevant around Ulda/ZF/ST level dungeons from my own experience (could be different based on your group comp/skill/gear/etc).
---
For leveling outside dungeons have him watch some youtube videos on arms leveling with hamstring kiting and rage pooling.  tell him to get a swing timer addon!  this will make it so much faster by eliminating downtime.  Warriors can easily do 7-8 days of /played of game time to level 60 without speed running.  
---
Also, don’t do too many dungeons bc unless your in a cleave group, its generally bad xp/hr, especially without quests.  
---
Most importantly have fun and enjoy your time in the game.
---
An alternate timeline with brand new expansions would be sweet. This time Blizz shouldn't turn it into a pussy whipped Disneyland though.
---
Bigglegang
---
&gt; They hated it for silly reasons
---
That's hilariously opinionated. Reasons you might find 'silly' are reasons others might think are very important. We don't all have fun in the same ways.
---
Are you for real? My whole comment was a complaint. Blizzard is banning political references and I disagree with the decision.
---
The real question is. If you have nothing to about the topic then what the fuck are you doing here commenting? Jesus Christ, I'm sure there are better ways to kill time than not reading someone's but then replying to it anyway. That's the dumbest thing I've heard all day lol. Thanks for the laugh.
---
For me I would want to see what endgame looks like in classic, because I think TBC and Wrath are both better than vanilla and going through those and then diverging off to do new things with old vanilla land masses that weren’t use til cata would be good. I just can’t see the classic having a ton of longevity for most people if classic+ is just finishing out a few of the old zones. The gameplay in tbc and wrath was much better imo as well, giving the new content they would make a stronger foundation.
---
Do you have the same problem with the map being enlarged? Like full screen.
---
No, it's a farming meta.  It's going to be prevalent even at 60.
---
That's actually a really good solution to the power creep problem. Horizontal progression with resistances.
---
It is an amazing engine
---
I don't agree, it's close enough to the lower levels and many people run alts.
---
Sure there’s plenty of neckbeards who’d love to leave a deposit in Sugarbanks
---
&gt;You also had a CRITICAL failure in the launch of classic.
---
Player counts, ingame chat, and the general attitude on the popular posts in this forum heavily disagree.
---
I wouldn't mind if these servers existed as an option, but I'll take a hard no on it being enforced everywhere.
---
In all WoW versions, all OS versions and with all mouses I used I have had that glitch that my "steering" would switch to a different angle all of a sudden sometimes. Makes me really good at instinctively correcting distract. Saved me from this a few times already during the last week. Makes me finally appreciate that glitch after 15 years.
---
Follow them around typing /train
---
Put me in the camp of wanting to go to BC/WotLK, but without the things that helped to make the game into retail. (I.E. LFD, EZ Epics, etc.)
---
Yup, it seems like blizz patched it :( Was just a matter of time really.
---
It takes you out of the world.  The easier it is to travel between places, the more the game turns into these weird, disconnected boxes with really no continuity between them.  If you're flying anyway and flying is completely safe, then you may as well be teleporting because the interaction with the world is the same either way.
---
Someone was just raging yesterday about drive by viper stings, dude went nuts. Wonder how many hunters are doing this, rofl.
---
I kinda like the small ways people can annoy each other(before it gets to actual griefing). As a rogue, I take nearly every opportunity to slightly screw someone. Hope to be on a lot of alliance players' lists.
---
But that's just the point
---
You will effectively lose an equal amount of hp by having to lifetap more times to account for the extra spells you are casting to make up for the 33% damage deficit you are running by using voidwalker instead of succubus
---
I never think about mana because you should always be life tapping
---
If you are life tapping more and increasing your time to kill, then it's worth using a non tank pet, taking some damage but life tapping less and decreasing your time to kill
---
cvars were able to be used in vanilla... there goes #nochanges blizz
---
True classic. Keep it at that way isn't that the whole point of this?? Also I think it's funny we aren't even into a month released and people are talking about expansions lol.
---
The only item you can farm before you have the quest is arcanite the rest are quest items you buy from the imp in blasted lands for 250g.
---
WotLK baby plsssss it's all I ask, let me spam +20 int gems in my holy paladin
---
It hurts me to say it (I'm a typical night elf enthusiast), when it comes to priests then either human or dwarf are better options.
---
I like classic+ but don't increase the level cap. Introduce new class spells that are parts of long quest chains, re-balance specs to make stuff more viable and call it a day.
---
Serious question: what makes you guys think a Classic+ option is even on the table? Was there some post or interview where they openly said they were considering such a thing? 
---
I ask because it sounds like wishful thinking that they'd actually create a whole separate team to make content exclusively for Classic. If it's actual story/lore then there's the conflict of always having to explain to WoW players whether it's "WoW retail or WoW Classic." Imagine the presentations at BlizzCon where they're trying to explain two divergent stories of the same game/franchise...
---
What paper rpgs do you have in mind?
---
Literally same thing happened to me, nameplates only coming up within 10 yards. Supper frustrating as i cant pick or see any mobs from a distance. Tried a bunch of cvar commands to fix, disabled addons, nothing. Suspect blizz changed and if they did, its retarded.
---
Yes! That's all I have to say. I just wanted to express this in a comment because it's something I would LOVE.
---
Sadly, yes.
---
Tbc, best time in wow
---
They might as well just go back to retail.
---
Yeah seemed patched today. It's cancerous and awful game design. Disable it on PvP targets if you must. Let me play something resembling a good video game when I'm soloing, please...
---
Dont stress you just need to find the right guild. A heap of guilds use point systems so eventually youll get loot on merit if you consistently raid with them. 
---
As for dungeons if you need the item need it if you dont greed it. 95% of the time everyone is on the same page yeah there are some dicks out there but its a quick way to get yourself blacklisted and having no one want to do dungeons with you anymore
---
PSTVD
---
I would cry from happiness to play wrath again my word.
---
Leveling a warrior solo is hell
---
Are there bgs?
---
It wasn't a good stat, it was a stat that tried to solve the issue with being blown up in coordinated group PVP but it completely changed the feel of PVP in any situation and made PVE gear feel more dull outside of explicitly PVE situations. A better solution would have just been to flat nerf crit damage or crit rate in PVP and keep PVP gear as better because of stats like stam than adding in a stat that felt mandatory for PVP.
---
I disagree that there needs to be such a hard "catch up or reset mechanic" and would argue that classic included soft versions of these mechanics. Having MC be the source of TF and hand of rag kept players coming back. Naxx would get farmed forever even if they made a level 60 t4, t5, t6... etc because players will be farming the splinters. Maybe add Karazan as a catchup mechanic like ZG was. 
---
It really isn't impossible to give new players a means to catch up and resetting for the xpansion was the beginning of the end in my opinion. It was the beginning of achievement meaning nothing.
---
I'm a priest. I had the lovely reminder that elemental mobs are resistant to their own element when I was doing a quest in STV and my wand was water fighting a water elemental.
---
Had to dot and whiff for ever cause I've never leveled my melee weapon.
---
I mean if they wanted to do Classic+ they'd have to start working on it soon if they had any hope of getting it out by the time the content phases complete their rollout.
---
Option 4, expansions happen on the server, but as soon as a Vanilla server gets BC, a new Vanilla server replaces it. 
---
I don’t want a stagnant server where you max out and then nothing happens. Let me experience the progression and “replay” the game as it was released over the years.
---
As long as private servers return, for the people who do want to keep classic on repeat. I wouldn't want to leave out the people who fought for classic in the first place!
---

/castsequence reset=2 !Shoot, null  
---
/dance
---
any way to run the macro without the /dance emote getting spammed?
---
4. No blood elves in the horde
---
Hyjal too
---
I don't play Classic or Wow at the moment but I'd still like to give my opinion.
---
True Classic is what I believe would/will happen, Since I believe that's what people originally wanted.
---
Classic+ sounds *okay* but I'm unsure if they'd be able to keep the classic/vanilla feel with new contet too?  
---
Would be really hard but they could maybe do it.
---
Classic Expansions I believe is the coolest one but I'm unsure it'd work because that would maybe drag too many (excuse me if I sound like a complete idiot) players away from Classic and then make each "expansion server" a sparcly populated server instead of a active and alive one such as Classic.
---
Still would really like to play BC and WOTLK though without going through Private Servers.
---
Meta slaves are going to just copy what's deemed optimal without putting any thought into why.
---
I mean looting can be bad in classic but for the most part you /roll on things including chests you find in dungeons to make it more fair. And if someone ninjas well they usually get kicked or u can just not play with them anymore.
---
Are you using ElvUI with the map option disabled?? What’s the addon that you are using to show coordinates?
---
Same, raid content was on point. Even WotLK which introduced and expanded all these negatives had some great raid content, primarily Ulduar.
---
Give me burning crusade or give me death!
---
This is my plan as well. Level my lock, then use his funds to help make leveling a warrior easier. I’ll play a less challenging class to level when I roll opposite faction for the first time.
---
No flying mounts
---
The original AMA where they said that each layer has a max pop and will fill before a new layer is created? 
---
Why would they force split a server if the population is low? Makes absolutely zero sense.
---
I had the same issue and this (the first part) solved the problem for me.
---
yes, and it would take place in space, so basically a StarCraft MMORPG
---
I'm still so fucking bitter that SC2 is basically just Warcraft 4 in space.
---
Alchemy/eng I know eng doesn't get a transmute but it's still kinda needed for most twinks imo
---
&gt;Faction homogenization
---
You need pallies and shamans on both sides or you can't have any raid content that relies on them.
---
Other than that, though, I agree with all of it.
---
Why is this even a question, yeah sure completely unchanged and keep on deleting my content/progress/efforts every few months/year!!!  
---
No dude, new content tailored for 2019 Classic, Jesus wtf.
---
2 elixir of shadow power, 6 large brilliant shards, 25 dark iron ore, 3 black dragonscales, 1 arcanite bar, the rest are quest items and things you buy from an imp in blasted lands I think for 250g.
---
The occulus. I enjoyed the terrain puzzle, but not the vehicle aspect.
---
Can you give any examples?
---
Or, "Roll for caster staff. And done. Roll for Leather dps belt. And done. Roll for the rest of the stuff. And done. Everyone also drink/eat and rebuff? Good, on to the next boss."
---
Because they are power tripping assholes. They removed a ton of mine even when I spent time getting screenshots from ingame and items into the meme by declaring it low effort. Meanwhile a shitty screeenshot of some ingame low pixel face with a ‘MRW’ type post gets upvoted and remains. I just stopped bothering, they can fuck off.
---
Yeah because they're all told that Warrior is the best DPS at endgame.
---
Some of the mods of these subs really have a double standard.  I had my Nazjatar day 2 post removed because it didn't have a picture related to WoW while I've definitely seen other memes went thru.  It's frustrating.
---
Yeah really. If it were green and not blue would people be gushing over 2 stam and 6 spirit at lvl 18?
---
I think he meta's going to be half of all raid slots being filled by mages.
---
I agree completely that people should explore every facet of their skills and class to tune their play, that people should know and use the right tools for the right situation. I ain't suggesting sitting in D stance. 
---
Just...if holding aggro on a mob or mobs is an issue, it could be an issue with communication with the group, like kill order or DPS jumping the gun, or it could be just unlucky procs, or it could be because the tank's focusing too much on DPS when it is threat he should worry about, in which case, why not Zoidberg (or D stance)?
---
Can we have both?
---
You asked. Besides, not wanting to go into the clinic *is* my choice. You made yours too, by the way, and if you want some utters on your fat cow then you should reroll.
---
classic+
---
It's a lot like the gearscore/achievement of proof craze that happened starting in WotLK or Cata.  People pretend that there's only one way to do things and anything not within their narrow realm of view isn't worth doing.
---
I'm 46 now. Druids also usually know what they're doing. I've had so many crappy warriors that don't know what they're doing. I've had so many warriors tank 2h. Not one time have I had a bad druid tank so far. Give me a druid tank any day for any 5 man dungeon
---
A lot of the time it’s easier to just go. Alliance has a big base there you can get from wetlands
---
Could be none. Could just be a fun little easter egg that a bored game dev put in 16 years ago, knowing that almost nobody would ever see it.
---
You make a lot of assumptions about me.
---
I would argue complete vanilla would be timeless without updates.
---
I have super nintendo games I still play today. A good game is a good game.
---
Big battles on Biggles today. It was a lot of fun. The leave held for most of the day questing. But the war for yeti spawns spilled into the whole zone.
---
It found spiritbloom or whatever it’s called for a WC quest. I can tell you that much.
---
Delete them all and re roll a shaman
---

---
I have never found anything in any game as exciting as PKing in original Runescape. 3 hitting another pure in Varrock and seeing that blue sword in the bones. God damn. The exhilaration of it all man.  
---
My best friend and I would play next to each other back in the day. His dad had high speed internet for that time frame and loved tech. 2 PCs next to each other in the basement. Dope as shit. 
---
We would fish lobbys all week to have food for PKing on the weekends at his house. We went through PKing at all combat levels and styles. Lvl 9-11 pure mages was aight but level 31-34 r2h pures were the best way to PK imo. Knowing no one is a pray beast made the rush that better when we got kills. But fuck leveling arching. Hated that shit. 
---
One day in 2003 I came home from school and wanted to PK. I went on his character because mine didnt have any lobbys on it. Head to Varrock, edge hugging in world 1. Crowded as fuck. Then I see this level 32 walk into wildy. This level 32 is wearing black legs, black chest, ammy, crossbow, and a yellow fucking party hat. 
---
I walk into wild and am fixated on this motherfucker. He walks out. He walks in. Repeats this for a little bit. Then he walks in and up to the tree level where wildy level 2 started. I follow. He walks toward me, gets close, goes by me. I follow him back down to lvl 1. As soon as I get into level 1 he walks to the edge, stops, and shoots an arrow at me, skulling himself. I attack and 2 hit that boy.  
---
I eat lobby quick to make room, right click that loot pile and get that hat. Run the fuck out. 
---
Next thing I know a whole influx of lvl 33 and 32s are logging in. I got out safe. I log out and get offline because back then it was dial up for me and I wanted to call my friend. Tell him we are rich bitch and what happened. I sold the hat for 3.5 mil that night and split the money with my friend. It supported our PKing for a long time. My friend also used his money to buy rare shit and play the market. 
---
We were there for the halloween mask drops. We were there for the duping debacle. I remembee Runescape without members content. The whole story of what original Runescape started out as and what it became (PKing, trade market with rares, etc) is a fantastic one. A free mmorpg you played in a browser.
---
What a fucking game, man.
---
I have a feeling it will most likely be the third option, since they have already talked about how all the hard work is already out of the way with adapting vanilla Wo/.
---
It’s obvious that most people want a Classic+ system, but I am afraid that Blizzard will need a preponderance of people to speak out about otherwise they will just go down the easier path.

---
Eff, I absolutely hated the vehicle bullshit in WotLK. It was thankfully minimal in BC--where I also hated it--but they really went all in in Wrath and then even worse in Cataclysm, which was already bad in so many ways. 
---
It's nice to play Classic and not have to worry about dumbass vehicle quests.
---
I ran into issues first time in uldaman.  Some groups are OK. Others pull threat all over the place.  I'm a pally tank and was buffing everyone with sanctuary to reduce their threat too.  People just don't attack marks.  Always one person does an AOE that steals all my threat
---
Classic expansions for sure. Just no further than wrath.
---
I never played early wow, I really only played mists.. but I love a challenge and I’m having a blast playing warrior right now. 
---
But I’m only lvl 15 in Loch.  Still have plenty to go
---
How would you deal with the issue of dying servers if not for cross realm activities? Do people need to pay to change servers simply because they got unlucky enough for their server to die? Do they have to restart and just lose their original character? I don’t really see how the game could exist without it at this point, yet a ton of people always speak about it with disdain.
---
That guy needs to go back to retail with his shitty additive and no knowledge of how to play a paladin.
---
I dislike world PvP = I want to play retail?     
---
    
---
You are a professional athlete. in mental gymnastic that is.
---
That picture is psyops
---
He was referring to the fact that during Vanilla, it was changed so you no longer had to hit a mob that granted exp in order to gain weapon skill. He wasn't talking about Classic at all.
---
Name checks out
---
Thanks! I’ve had a lot of fun tanking DM. I’ve never played wow before, let alone ranked, so its hard to get used to it. Especially when all my party members have run it a billion times it seems. I’m having fun tanking though, and it’s really easy to find a group doing it, so I think I’ll continue
---
Do it like osrs. New content but not the same content as retail.
---
Noice! It's worth the wait. Just don't pay attention to getting in "late" and try to rush things. Classic is optimal for burnout if played at the same pace as retail.
---
And no, I don't lurk new posts... 
---
Wait.
---
I kinda wanna experience the expansions since I never did in retail, but classic+ sounds a ton like what OSRS did and that's amazing
---
Which AH add-on and do you like it?
---
I agree and if we could remove time-gated progression on raids while still keeping the same kind of time organisation and guild-based game play I'd be all up for removing it. But having one necessary evil that we haven't got a good solution for isn't a good reason to expand on time-gated content.
---
Forgive me,  I am not advocating throwing away your other stances, or not exploring your options in a fight. Also forgive the bear tank mention, it was offered in a joking spirit.
---
A lot of what you are talking about in your post boils down to telling DPS "wait a few seconds after pull to start, and then focus X first before AoEs." If they don't want to listen or slow up DPS at all, and aren't good at judging burn phases when it's okay to pull a mob or using their defensive cooldowns...well, there is only so much the tank can do, and they can get comfy on the floor till the fight is over.
---
As a tank your Job 1 is threat, Job 2 is mitigation, Job 3 is DPS. Mitigation can mean doing more DPS to mitigate the mob's DPS to 0 because it is dead, of course. But this part of the fight:
---
&gt; There are definitely times where you want to be sitting in defensive stance managing aggro for a while 
---
And this part of the fight:
---
&gt; all the times you aren't needing to spam more sunder and things are stable and you have a bunch of free GCDs and extra rage 
---
are different moments. You recognize this, I am not trying to lecture you on it. Just that when you have the threat and are free to jump to Job 3, and when you don't have the threat and you need to focus on Jobs 1 and 2, are fundamentally different parts of the fight.
---
Yeah fuck that guy for wanting to play with his friends.
---
Welcome to the dark side.  We have glowing green soul cookies.
---
Would be nice!
---
Classic Expansions
---
Level 60 Cap
---
Introduce Flying Mounts through world bosses, endgame bosses, make it really hard to get. I'd prefer to keep all the giant dragons and shit away, keep it small and simple. Once again, hard to acquire. 
---
Add harder mechanic raids after Naxx, where great gear, teamwork, etc, is only way to progress. 
---
Level 60 Arena could be cool. 
---
More Battlegrounds, like through reputation based factions.
---
Theres a difference between wanting your hand held and wanting to quest without getting your corpse camped, buddy
---
You’re not understanding the question of this post...you being o.k with your appearance is great for you. I’m o.k with my, erm, fat cow(?) but would changing it from a male to a female affect the integrity of wow?
---
I had a year of game time after about 3 years of playing when game came out
---
Illegal/immoral Classic thoughts.  Ban him.  Immediately.
---
Yes. Tbc is basically a much more approved apon Vanilla, If you really think about it.
---
I appreciate it! I went through the individual plugins and found DisplayOnRightSide but first loading screen it reset. So I'll dig through again tonight! Appreciate it, sleek UI by the way.
---
What levels have you made it to so far?
---
Had a similar experience, but I was the "no u" guy. Got such a kick out of it I nailed the brave soul some gold.
---
These aren’t mutually exclusive. They could issue expansions and copy characters while keeping Classic server versions and restarting those. That’s what I prefer
---
Some players hassle us to pull faster, or worse yet get impatient and pull themselves.  Puts tanks on edge about going quick enough, causes issues.
---
Of course some people are bads that's just a thing.
---
&gt;  you don't waste any of those precious swings on your 62% offhand damage with a 24% base miss chance.
---
Again, it's more to synergize with unbridled wrath and provide more rage than it is to provide raw damage. Also, the offhand has just as much chance to crit as far as I know, so it's procing flurry to counteract it wasting some swings. I'd have to math out if it exactly cancels our or what though.
---
&gt; Bloodthirst is equally good with a 1h or a 2h though
---
Yes, but MS with a 2h hits way harder than bloodthirst does with either because it scales solely off of weapon damage rather than requiring a bunch of high-end gear stacking attack power. Bloodthirst is something you take instead of MS *because* you're DWing and it's the only alternative that doesn't suffer for it. When using a 2h and bloodthirst, you're just opting to use a weaker skill.
---
I wonder how Mists of Pandaria would with a 'classic mindset'
---
I always read “back in my day” phrases in Deckard Cain’s voice. So fitting.
---
I'd be down with classic + . What I enjoy about classic is the required social aspects of the game, the class fantasies and class identities present in this version of wow... And lastly and most importantly in my opinion.. classic gives me players the impression that we the players are but a small part of a huge, and dangerous world. As long as those elements of the game remain in tact, I really don't care at all how / if they decide to progress the game
---
I'd love it if they had a system similar to whats in ArcheAge where you can flag on your own faction.
---
You're playing a class that doesn't even have to respec. gtfo.
---
Classic expansions is where I would go. Being able to make a char on different severs with progression within each expansion.
---
There's no accountability.
---
There were so many ass hats that would need on blues that didn't really need them because what is anyone gonna do? They live in a completely different server.
---
In same realm dungeon finders, you could contact the leader of the guild or just harass the ass hole and pretty soon they'd get a reputation.
---
Man rp guys are like hobbits...
---
I'd like a bit of a "What If" feel, not the the level of zany that comics take it to, but something which diverges from the story already told but keep true to Classic mechanics and difficulty
---
Sorry for the spelling mistakes, Strawpoll.me don't have the most readable interface. (makes it harder for people like me who really need to proof read their English as second language)
---
Couldn't agree more, makes me want to reroll off mage to melee..
---
Its not what you think.  You could have 500 healing+ and your flash of light heal will only be boosted by 50-100 points at 60. Its all about the coefficients. Each spell has different.
---
LOL  I have 4 gold   damn I am poor.
---
What are they farming in there?
---
It has been working for me. Worked for gloom/doom weed and serpentbloom in Wailing Caverns. I don't remember if it worked for fungal spores or not.
---
I don't think this is really the place to do guild recruitment. Try your server's official forum or perhaps your server discord.
---
The yeti cave is a shithole on Stalagg.

---
Grobb does seem heavy Alliance compared to Horde.
---
The first time I did it, no one seemed to understand what happened. I just played dumb and it was all good. Even did it a couple of times to see if I could get away with it. Just had to take the buff off quickly, after people died, so they never noticed it.
---
Or you blame other DKs in the raid!
---
Well I'm not taking prot spec spells but I am arms and fury
---
Wish my husband would gift me this rofl
---
I feel like this is the only place in the game where jumping is actually required. Is it?
---
Classic didnt do it for me, i'll weit for wotlk
---
It’s underneath the candle room effectively
---
I use this and its amazing. I can remember who tanks well and who doesn't. I can also remember who had bad attitudes or ninjaed gear (aka who to ignore when I'm looking for more people for a PuG)
---
I dunno if it changed or not.  The translate tool thing that's being passed around will make you say numbers and such instead.  
---
I think I vaguely recall hearing that they changed the language filter at some point but that might be false.
---
classic+ that maintains the spirit of classic. no flying etc. also the feeling of being a small part of a big world rather than everyone being the main character
---
So you’re gonna perpetuate the behavior that you hate? By taking it out on lowbies that are trying to quest, just like you were? 
---
Be the change you want to see, mate
---
I have a 1080 and it automatically set to low...for authencity, I supposed
---
Pre 30 you don’t even have to life tap, and dots are the most mana efficient form of damage in the game. With mp5, dotting and wanding pre 30, it is simply not an issue
---
Hard agree. I was a regular raider in BC and played all the time. That stupid addition (the place with the jousting dailies) and everything that came along with it is where i pretty much stopped playing. Think i let my sub expire, renewed for cata, then never played again until now.
---
Oh OK that's good to know cause it would be rediculous to have to ladder build the late stuff.
---
Clearly and 100% I would prefer Classic+ .
---
True Classic has a lifetime issue. That is guaranteed to become stale once the nostalgia wains.
---
I do want some quality of life to come to Classic. People berate LFR and the dungeon finder pugs, but I'd much rather have a system that gets me into the dungeon/raid over returning to this trash LFG Chat and DKP raid systems. The dungeon finder NEEDS to happen. I can live/love every other thing in Classic from Vanilla, but LFG Chat needs to go.
---
(To be completely frank this isn't even Vanilla. Vanilla didn't see weather until the end/BC. Vanilla didn't have AHs in every major city. IF was the alliance capital.)
---
I would rather Blizzard make a game that had a collection of good ideas from all expansions. For example,
---
- I would like the raid tier structure from TBC
---
- I would like the graphics of retail
---
- I would like to be a lone adventurer similar to Vanilla, rather than a champion of the alliance.
---
- I would like the dps rotations of WotLK / Cata (Maybe controversial)
---
- I would like some quest help (at the very least show exclamation marks like they did in tbc)
---
Some thing are very subjective, but I do think a line could be drawn not to pull in changes that are detrimental to the spirit of the game.
---
Yeah now you can just sit on the arena and get shot at by mages in tanaris.
---
Some folks are born maaaade to wave the flag, oooo the red white and blue
---
Classic+ ! 
---
It never made sense as Outlands to be the first expansion. We need Northrend to finish off the Frozen Throne!
---
I've spent 75% of my game time since logging on today fleeing from mobs that I had no idea I was even going to pull. I'm a priest, so not really great forms of CC to help me if I pull even *one* extra mob. I can see where it's disadvantageous for PvP and I understand that 100 is way too big, but mobs shouldn't have their healthbars vanish when they flee...
---
Big money warlocks like me even give soul stones.
---
Nice 69'in each other in the dungeon.
---
Yes. A staple of old school MMOs is the "permanent" aesthetic of ones character - name, appearance, etc. Additionally, sex changes didn't exist in Vanilla, and so such a service would break with the "#noChanges" atmosphere of the project.
---
What if in patch 1.4 they made the two unplayable specs more of mid teir
---

Vanilla had this system, but very poorly done. They removed it for classic.
---
Oh god, another member of &lt;insert community here&gt;  that goes out of their way to post an explanation for the problem someone's presented that they've conveniently pulled straight out of their ass and have no prior knowledge for.  
---
That then goes on a high horse rant about how the OP is mean to them and nasty for pointing out that they've replied with information that is as useful as tits on a bull. 
---
Someone posts completely irreverent information in a blatant attempt to get the OP to bite, OP does,  OH MY GOD QUICK LETS POINT OUT HOW MEAN THEY ARE HE INSULTED ME LOOK  &lt;Y&gt; COMMUNITY IS SO TOXIC!
---
Classic is time intensive and expensive though. 
---
At least, that's my assumption. Going back through Classic and comparing it to modern WoW, where everything is homogenized and everyone goes through the same content, regardless of faction, Classic is very bespoke. Bespoke content (Eff, I hate that word) tends to be time intensive and expensive to make. 
---
Everything is carefully laid out and carefully planned and executed for each individual race and faction.
---
Just wait until Classic isn't new and shiny anymore.  In a couple of months Blizz will have to start stapling servers together  like it does on Retail or else some of those new servers they kept throwing up on launch will be ghost towns.
---
This isn't retail. Stop attacking targets I don't have threat on and get a threat meter.
---
Really hard to grab threat on three targets all being attacked by three different people when you didn't even pull and still mark targets.
---
As a dps, you can't really attack for 2 or 3 seconds so why don't you mark things during the pull?
---
Classic+ is probably the most viable way to rejuvenate the vanilla content.
---
Day 123123 still waiting for that addon name
---
Exactly! People looking for ZF all the time just because it is easy to AoE XP farm!
---
I've had the same happen to me. I'm finding that the faction split on my server is far less important than the willingness of alliance to fight.
---
I've had several people say they don't want to fight because it slows down questing. Why are you on a pvp server then!?
---
Just FYI, 3 is the default value for Classic, so you don't need to change anything.
---

---
Definitely hit 28k raid buffed in BC as a warrior in karazan gear.
---
All valid points. Thanks for very constructive feedback.
---
As a Warlock, I am indifferent, I view them as an expendable resource. Like I am Stalin and they are the Red Army. I can always conjure the same one again from the demon other world. If it was a pet I would feel bad though.
---
It was fun for a little while.
---
I'd like Classic --&gt; TBC --&gt; WOTLK. But once it's finished progressing some sort of seasonal ladder system that has like a new fresh realm where you can play then once its finished your character can be moved back to the "master" realm, and another fresh realm is opened.
---
So if all you wanted to play was classic (or any other xpac) then you could keeping doing that with the long seasons.
---
Basically like Diablo 3 seasons.
---
Currently doing this...first time playing classic lol
---
Reroll, or just wait a while. Most of  these servers are going to reach the average Vanilla pop eventually.
---
The first minute of [this video](https://youtu.be/w9bHLDpYmC4) sums it up soooo good. Don't give up Boi, us slowbies are the majority!
---
Adding more content in azeroth, yeah maybe. Adding new areas like outland?   
---
Part of the problem with the retail is the world is so vast that the social aspect of the game is lost. If they add some new place to go to, it spreads the playerbase even thinner.
---
Or just do BRD like you'd normally do and get the quest after wiping.
---
Probably vendored it and bought the hammer from the vendor lol
---
I think it shouldn't be an increase at all, but something that makes underutilised specs viable.
---
Gimme that classic+ fam. Flying mounts? No thanks. Daily quests? No thanks. Heroic dungeons? Pass. Horde paladins? Ass. 
---
Hit me with the level 60 things we were gonna get but never got.
---
Classic + plz.
---
I dont want to follow the same road that destroyed the wow we (The Vanilla fans) love.
---
All of wotlk, but NOT the later changes, like revamp of talents, dungeon finder, etc.
---
I'm hoping they do classic+ and essentially do a different timeline. Start the game over and do what they want to do if they got a second chance.
---
Just wait when you're pugging UBRS. Getting 10 people and someone with a key is going to be fucking great. Bonus points for when the priest healer leaves because three assholes in the party won't bother clearing the whelp room and boss for shoulders.
---
I just hope we're past that huge incompetence where people can't handle Rend's event, wipe and the group disbands.
---
Classic+ please
---
Much dainty
---
Everyone has to drink but if the lock pulls correctly you clear a completely massive chunk. Most pug "aoe" groups I've been apart of are very mediocre with, almost without question, someone has frostbite and it completely fucks the runs and slows everything to a crawl. 
---
Now when the stars align and a good group gets together you clear the absolute fuck out of the dungeon and add those guys for later.

The only asmon posts i see on this sub is people complaining about him. If you people really hate him that much and want him to go away, THEN STOP GIVING HIM ATTENTION. This sub already hates him and agrees with you. Hate threads keep him a relevant topic on this sub.

Pick My Nose
---
Don't worry, it the same horde side.
---
People want to rush to 60, especialy if you come from retail, its a side effect induce by Blizzard
---
I got the rod in 8 kills I think. Never been so lucky with it, thank god
---
My biggest problem is that I don’t mind putting effort into a group but I want my healers and dps to put in work too.
---
Don’t complain about aggro if you don’t wait for me to get threat before you aoe the pack.
---
Don’t complain you’re going oom to much if you keep wasting mana by over healing me because I dropped to 95%.
---
People want me to mark but then ignore the marks and refuse to cc because “muh damage”. Healers want me to kite so they don’t have to heal as much but then complain I can’t keep aggro off of the dps.
---
These are dungeon GROUPS, you should know what to cc and what to priority target, especially in a game this old. It is not on tanks to tell you how to do everything so please stop expecting it. I don’t mind helping people but I’m not here to do everything so you can sit back and smash your 2 dps buttons.
---
Hell, the most popular private server has 2 wrath servers. One with no DF and no cash shop and harder tuned raids. Sucks they added cross server bgs/arenas though, kinda easy to get stomped but they did it cause the no DF server was mostly people running raids and not bgs so ques were getting long.
---
I don’t want true classic and I’m concerned a classic+ would mean no real class rebalancing which is the biggest downfall of classic imo. I hate that as a shadow priest right now I will absolutely not get in any public groups because there are a thousand other non shadow priest options.
---
21 points in beast mastery.
---
I literally have never heard of passing on greed rolls because of winning them, and I played from the beta on (quit in cata). 
---
Plus the passing after winning a need I've only ever seen after the person wins a big piece of gear. Like if a rogue won the blue leggings in WC he might pass on several of the green pieces he needs, but if that dope mace drops you would probably expect him to roll again.
---
There was a video a long time ago where a dude completely controlled the AH economy by doing this.
---
I would donate my penis if it meant I could play WotLK again.
---
If you are curious I run an i7 6700 and rtx 2070 at 165 frames 1440p and everything 99% maxed out I’m at 165 frames most of the time, 150+ in busy places.  I’m not saying you need either of those, but that’s my experience.
---
You'll be fine, i'm about to finish STV and i haven't done almost any PVP, everybody is saying hello to each other and doing their own thing so ganking someone actually makes me feel like an asshole. It has come to a point where i'm happy when someone ganks me because then i can start killing without feeling bad about it.
---
Theres post literally on the front page about how much better the classic community is, stop acting like this isnt a circle jerk.
---
But hey, youre part of the classic community and really let your colors be shown here :)
---
BC was definitely harder (though CC was also a lot easier for some classes)...the dungeons were designed for multiple CC.
---
The biggest challenge in classic is threat. A warrior with no rage just isn't going to be able to tank anything if the hunter opens with multi-shot or the shaman whirlwind procs something other than his main target.
---
And my Axe!
---
So  if you stay  dead and dont release it auto brings u  to life?
---
There's an incredibly clear divide between a group building tool and an automated dungeon finder. Retail even has both at once.
---
"Cath should not take 40 mins"
---
"To be fair I aoe farm"
---
Well there you go. Absolutely sm Cath can and will take 40 mins. there are other classes in classic besides mage, and priest. 
---
You like AOE farm groups, cool. That's a super efficient way of leveling and very much tell metagame right now.
---
I'd rather tank a dungeon for a balanced group, maybe *gasp* not even a mage dps to be seen. And we're going to pull quickly, yet methodically, utilizing our class abilities and line of sight pulls. We might even chat a bit and make new friends... helps when your eyes aren't glued to your xp/hr add on.
---
Wrath yes please
---
I don't think it was better than TBC but I think wow had a second peak in MoP, at least for pvp and class design it did
---
My impression is that it will depend heavily upon which side of this argument Blizzard falls. There are 2 or 3(the ones I know of) TBC pserver projects in development currently, which is huge and pretty unusual. 
---
If Blizzard went either the Classic+ route or just maintained the servers in a vanilla state and leaving it at that... I could definitely see a significant portion of the population moving to TBC pservers to continue their journey.
---
Parallel universe WoW.
---
We discover we aren't on the same timeline, because somehow the heroes of Azeroth have knowledge of the future, and warn key figures of coming events.
---
Also, I would be really bummed if the realm reset.
---
You max out in armor effortlessly, so getting a base set for tanking isn’t that hard. Getting the good stuff is because it’s locked away in end game stuff.
---
I rolled a human mage my first time around on a PvP server that was 80% horde
---
#NEVER AGAIN
---
There should be options and different servers like a static server that wipes every few months, a constantly progressing server that goes through all the expansions and a server for new classic content they could use unused ideas and assets from vanilla
---
Yeah that's something that has baffled me for months. There's no way people are running out of quests, they just don't like to travel.
---
What about WoW+ instead of just Classic+? Personally I loved Cataclysm's new zones. Didn't really appreciate how they butchered old ones, and the flying would have to go obviously. They could go through the steps of each expansion so they can reuse assets but make them better this time. 
---
Less grindy, less stuff like titanforging and dailies, no flying, no dungeon finder teleporting, more focus on having a main rather than a plethora of alts (no account bound pets/mounts).
---
Get a boar and keybind their charge, or just keybind any pets Dash.  Make a macro to drop a freeze trap.  You'll have to look it up, but it puts your pet on passive so you drop combat when you hit Feign Death, which allows you to drop the trap.  When they're frozen, run away and blow to them up.
---
Note: this only applies to mages priests locks and occasionally a warrior. Otherwise following a decent quest guide post 40 will be just as fast
---
Just says removed on my side...can’t see what this used to be, which is why I jokingly said its useful
---
Please sir, could I get some Classic+, with a side serving of Player Housing?
---
Eh, there aren't many situations where letting someone die actually makes them improve their current playstyle or saves time.
---
Go quest, mob grind, or start your own group, find a guild of willing participants around your level
---
Yes!!
---
Fair enough, I should have said implemented "more" time-gated progression. I still heavily disagree with it and wouldn't want it in any future expansions or content patches. There are ways to allow players to get raid comparable items without having to resort to a bland grind with no connection to the world.  
---
There are many items in Classic that are raid tier gear that you can get from dungeons, crafting, quests and whatever else, at least up until AQ/Naxx when itemization got more boring.
---
The Female Barbarian to Diablo 3 prediction we all missed.

So you're saying that because other people post nice things from X community this excuses you from being a complete Twunt in this thread?

Allrighty then.

For me, a chad, it's wrath.
---
At the moment Jade isn't worth more then 9s at least not on my server. I'm guessing they set it bid for 9s buyout higher. Also you should get the add-ons vendor price and/or auctioneer if your gonna be playing the auction house game.

I got my first ipod when I was 11 by flipping party hats and selling them for RL $$$. I made thousands before I was 13. I quit as soon as they made trading ridiculous, not sure when that was but wow what a change

Can all of you "YOU DON'T LIKE THING? GO BACK TO RETAIL" chuds just ***fuck off*** already?

I see you guys in every fucking thread. You contribute nothing to the discussion
---
If people don't want to run it, they won't run it even with lfg, unless they're doing random.
---
 But welcome to vanilla. 
---
There's a reason people had respect for anyone who actually got a 40man raid together back in the day. You expected to take an hour just to form up, another 15min for everyone to travel there, and several hours actually raiding. 
---
I used to spend entire evening's in Trade chat looking for UBRS, Strath &amp; Scolo runs. 
---
For Classic, join the LFG global channel &amp; quest or grind while looking.
---
&gt;Warriors are king of tanking raids. But druids dont get enough love.
---
Warriors are also the king of tanking dungeons. ...eventually. 
---
Once the engineering stuff comes out in later phases and they have half a dozen thorns effects stacked they're at anything as anybody.
---
Don't discount druids in raids though. With the exception of some bosses that's where they really shine. And if you're feral resto hybrid tank build you can just heal those fights lol.
---
Druids have a lot going for them.
---
They’d have to or the game would get stagnant
---
They finished all those plans in retail you fucking moron....
---
I say have some BoC and Wraith Servers. That sounds awesome!
---
Im not the one throwing out insults to those who disagree. Why cant you just have a normal conversation without resorting to name calling?
---
Thank you!
---
Get your cooking up and you will always have tons of free food to eat from what you kill.

so starshards is bad dps?

I actually came here to ask about this. I downloaded a Mac fan controller to crank up the rpms more than the stock rate and it helps a lot but it still seems weird.
---
I have Elvui and i NEED to know how you made your player nameplate have the mana and health layed out like that with the numbers please!!!!
---
liar! your love only last before the completion of your quest in that area.
---
Your an idiot.
---
I think having different servers with different expansions would be great. Realistically the split player base probably wouldn't be a big deal cause they could just make fewer realms so they'd be full.
---
I’ve got like 2 days play time on a rogue, and got him to 28. All I do is grind though, I’m sure if I focused on a more efficient way, it’d be faster. I just wouldn’t have any gold 😂

Been loving it. Never dropping frames so I turned up resolution scale to 4k and it still holds steady, I could go further but my frames dropped at 200% for me (Im on 1440p) and 4k seems a good stopping point.
---
I'm not sure TBC is that different from retail. It's the same "endgame is the game and nothing else matters" thing. It had good class design, I guess.
---
I think similar, except that we can bring in zones that are on azeroth - mainly thinking WotlK/Cata here, like mt hyjal.
---
Theme the areas around the *lead* up to the expansions stories. Everything is about preparation for future events - heck, eventually maybe have an event where heroes enter the dark portal...but *we* were left behind.(avoids needing to redesign flying areas in TBC, even though I really like some TBC areas)
---
Have us be the grunts that weren't able to go dimension/world hopping.  Give us events that lead to what happens to the world in cata instead - do an in-between-quel if you will.
---
Study your talent trees

Retail sucks for a reason

They are mediocre at everything.
---
Whats the “unofficial” Dreamweave set?
---
This wave of 2h tanks is kind of hilarious. It's something that I've never seen emerge until now, because some popular warrior has his theories on how its infinitely more effective. Now every retail boy with a clonker thinks he's a master strategist, all the while their healers make a mental note to never invite them again.
---
Classic+ seems like the best way to go.
---
You don't have to do one. You can do all the above. 
---
Have progression servers, classic +, and locked classic servers.
---
I feel like they should do nothing, just keep classic as it is, introduce fase 6 and just let it stay like that forever, no need to keep on supporting, let the classic “revival” be this social experience we are having now and then let it end, people need to learn to let things ends, no need to prolong shit forever until it becomes shit.
---
What I would like to see is retail getting closer to the classic feel, not the shit mailman quests or the 20 minutes ghost walks or the lack of flight paths, but the overall feel, not just the zones and the challenge of the game but how everything actually matters.
---
Don’t need to give me 12 flight paths per zone one every quest hub, but 1 per zone is just too few, blizz fails so hard to find these kinds of balance, they recognize a problem and their solution is to complete overdo shit and grab you by the hand, don’t need to be all 8 or 80 man.

---
 Grinding is less efficient time-wise than questing, yes. But it's much better for making gold, if you take the AH out of both equations. The AH is unreliable, especially at the start of a server when everyone is pinching pennies. Pure grinding with skinning and mining, and just vendoring basically everything, is an almost guaranteed way to be able to afford the mount at 40. I should have around 50g~ left over afterwards, too. 
---
If I wanted to go true hardcore about it, I'd have a couple alts at level 5. One to DE all greens and to use the enchanting mats to either sell or use, and one with engineering to turn the ore into grenades to vendor (they vendor higher than ore/bars i guess), one with tailoring to make and sell bags from my farmed linen, etc. If going all-in like that, apparently the maker of the guide I've been following has around 250-300g at level 40. That's too involved for me though. For now i just want to chill and still progress my character. 
---
Yes grinding is monotonous. I usually have twitch or a movie playing on my other monitor. So i don't have to focus all that much. I also do world pvp whenever i run into someone on the Alliance, so that helps break it up.
---
Abit of trivia, if i recall correctly the letters were actually mirrored when i saw them the first time, dunno if they changed.
---
I agree I think Druids are better tanks while leveling but people dislike druid tanks because they're told they suck for raiding but don't realize that has nothing to do with why they wiped in WC
---
Lok'tar Ogar friend.

TBF world pvp is going to explode once everyone is geared and 60 with money for alts

Damn I love this random plates.
---
&gt; How do you add new content without changing the existing content?
---
Fleshing out a new dungeon behind a gate doesn't effect the existing content.
---
&gt; but if you consider it more carefully, new content kind of by definition changes the existing content.
---
It doesn't effect the content at all.  All of the original stuff is still in place.  None of the old quests/zones/items have been altered.  Adding new content, such as a new zone, doesn't alter the existing content.

They are manifestations of the Void. They are only classified as demons for gameplay reasons. Technically they are formed from the chaos of the Twisting Nether, where demons also dwell. So it could be plausible that Voidwalkers could be demons, but rather void-infused demons. Warlocks do use shadow damage as well as fel magic so it's not a stretch to think that Warlocks get their power from a mix of Demonic and Void sources which let's then summon Voidwalkers.

Haha sit down kid.

I’m thinking something like the group builder on retail for M+ and what not. Everyone in the group chooses their role. Then you list yourself and it shows what the group needs for people to request to join.

Because it was medium in the first few days?
---
Because I don’t like to queue?
---
Because I didn’t know it would be a ghost town in the next week?

Cheers brotha

Lmao, thank you.

It doesnt need to be better, it needs to be offspec oriented stats/bonuses:

Dps tier for warriors and all hybrids
---
Spell dmg tier for rogues/hunters, enhancing poisons and arcane shot/stings? Just an idea
---
BattleMages
---
Destruction or Demonologist warlocks
---
Seeing the comments about Classic+ makes me sad. You think you do, but do you really?
---
BC was the best. I didn’t start Vanilla until about a month before the release, though so I’m probably biased. I just remember Kara. TRYING to gear for BT. Ugliest spiders in blades edge. So much fun.
---
From the years I spent playing vanilla WoW.
---
Most people know this by now. He wasn't asking that though. A
---
Or you can just play on private servers.
---
I am totally against classic+ because it's a huge slippery slope with a high chance of them fucking it up, it won't be the authentic classic experience anymore that people have wanted for years and will result in people flocking back to vanilla private servers
---
 Classic+ is also a high risk endeavour in terms of financial and creative resources, in this case the wow team is better off making a new retail expansion with classic philosophy with those resources instead of classic+.
---
 The best way to go ahead is for them to release 2 separate servers for TBC and WOTLK because these two expansions are widely considered as the best expansions by the community, also there is a huge community of TBC and WOTLK players out there playing on private servers. It's financially a good investment along with giving players more choice to play their preferred game.
---
 It will not divide the player base in the long run infact it will increase it because many people playing on private servers will return and give rise to dedicated communities on these servers as a result people will always have someone to play with whenever and whichever server they login. Sure it may fragment the community temporarily but that will only happen during launches of the individual servers however once the initial launch is done, it will lead to new dedicated communities on these servers the same way that people preferring classic wow will stay on classic instead of moving on.
---
 This can be achieved in two ways by giving an option to copy your character from classic or starting a fresh new toon, although I think an option to copy your classic character would be a better choice but that is something that can be discussed later on when the direction of the game is decided.
---
 So to sum up, have 3 different servers for the original trilogy and focus on making a new retail expansion with the philosophy of classic rather than going for classic +.

There's three, all of which have no mention of layer having no effect on total server capacity, and instead talk about the fact that layering balances the total population between layers.
---
I'd love to see yours now.
---
&gt;&gt;There is no need, a new layer is only created when the server population exceeds a certain limit; in terms of my previous example when a realm hits 4000 people (maybe fewer) then a second layer is created so each layer supports 2000 players, therefore reducing crowding.
---
&gt;That's exactly what I fucking said you dense mother fucker.
---
You're calling dense? Look at a fuckin mirror and read the rest of the comment in this thread.
---
&gt;The funniest part, is that is exactly saying that reducing layers means less people can get on a server. How is this so fucking hard for you to understand.
---
Less layers means more people per layer, not really hard to understand.
---
&gt;If the server is capable of handling 10 layers, each with a 3k capacity, then the SERVER CAPACITY IS 30000.
---
&gt;If they reduce the number of layers a server is allowed to have, without increasing the number of players per layer, then the server max population will decrease.
---
You're so fucking wrong I'm honestly just gonna stop. I can't argue with a brick wall of a person. You can reply whatever you want at this point.

Fair enough, the wording was poor on it being introduced in TBC but there was a dramatic shift towards every dungeon flowing more like a corridor. I disagree with some of your examples, RFD and BFD while being generally linear do have notable paths or routes. The SSC dungeons were actually well designed in my opinion but less so than the best classic dungeons. Even SM felt less like a corridor than most TBC dungeons despite literally being a corridor because the patrols and (pointless) side rooms made it feel like you were traversing an actual monastery along with all the unexpected pulls you might expect.  
---
By Hub city I didn't mean "major city" I meant a city where both factions come together and find everything they could want at their fingertips, including portals to every other major city. No one implied mages or druids didn't have teleports but that was a part of their class identity and asking mages to give you a portal is something people actually appreciate in Classic.
---
This is the kind of gif I was looking for
---
Listen I just want a world where it's classic but horde get Ogres as a playable race and alliance gets High Elves. As much as I love Draenei, those shoulda been the first races added.
---
Zug zug my friend...
---
I’m not really sure they can change a thing with classic. 
---
It would derail the whole point. 
---
I would go with alternative 1, but remove the part about resets. 
---
Why resets? 
---
That’s not a good idea. 
---
Alternative 2 seems tempting, but still, it destroys the whole point of classic. 
---
There is so many people that are going to get angry if they do anything to classic that is not classic so I do t really think they can.
---
i mean classic itself is nothing new. the only way to not fuck it up is have seasons
---
Same. I don't care if you are almost done with your escort quest. Get ready to fight. I get ganked so much by either groups or people 5+ levels above me. So now I just attack on sight.
---
I'm pretty certain you will have to find a creature that already knows screech rank 2. After using the ability a few times you will be notified that you have learned the ability. Petopia is your friend in this case.
---
You best miss me w/ that STV.  I'll be in Desolace killing Centaurs, or in SM Farming.  K thnx
---
Rolling a bunch of lowbies at a high level is something that can always be done in wow. The thing that cant always be done, is remain uncontested. The only time someone will be able to go around completely uncontested, are within this small time frame of classic release. After awhile there will be tonnes of level 60s you can call to stop that one dude killing noobs. But for now, theres few people who can stop a level 60 who wants to go to lower zones and kill low level players.
---
That is the incentive to level faster, or at least it was since the time frame to be a god is shrinking ad player levels get up there.
---
After a year of Naxx, many more people will be mad if no changes are made. And by mad, I mean they'll unsub.
---
Id love classic mop server, mop got me interested in the game, but was only able to pick it up in legion. Also i want to see the valley of eternal blossoms all un-garroshified
---
rather wack your face with a mace breh
---
So it's been 12 years, and you've completed every dungeon, and you have every piece of best gear 9 years ago.
---
You wouldn't like another equivalent of the wow classic launch?
---
Can confirm. Priest to lvl 40 with 3 days played, then I also did some tailoring and helping a friend get his warrior axe. Its no jokerd, but its much faster than I were in vanilla.
---
The ideal scenario, and what they honestly might do, is a "timewalking" experience. They will drop the next expansion, and if you want to participate, you go to a Bronze Dragonflight NPC and request to be put into that expansion, which would be phased out for whoever wanted to stay in vanilla, or previous expansion.
---
Otherwise they could very well devote a chunk of developers to changing how the progression goes in this new Classic version. That sounds like a lot more effort than they are willing to put into it though, unless they knew it would bring in way more subscribers.
---
Guy? This is 2019 how fucking dare you
---
Come on bro. Did you even level to 10 before coming to reddit? Play the game a little bit.
---
Classic+ would make sense with few updates gauged by community opinion. Essentially add content to the game, but carefully to ensure classic keeps the same feel. Like the OSRS model
---
Yep, even says on the tooltip, dismissing reduces happiness by 50.
---
Jousting dailies are what litterally killed the game for me. I didn't come back until classic launched.
---
Sadly agreed - Having classes revamped 50x over the entire course of the games history was painful and ridiculous.
---
I quit shortly after TBC and ever since i looked back and saw what they done to all my favourite builds and classes and simply wondered WTF are you guys doing and why?

When some guild on the opposite faction was heading to ZG and you were in the path.

Hey horde players on Fairbanks, chill the fuck out. Let’s all get to 60 then it will be a free for all in the gorge. But right now we all just need to level.
---
&gt;Yeah fuck that reset how in the hell is it true classic?
---
You just got your characters reset to nothing.
---
They can do it again.
---
Retail sucks for millions of reasons, but that doesn’t mean vanilla is perfect.
---
Don't duel wield till you're 60 with lots of prebis btw
---
Why is cross realms considered a bad thing?
---
I remember I was a gnome warlock on my way to BWL, and I saw an orc hunter kiting this impressive looking demon around. I still had a few minutes before raid time, so I thought I'd be helpful and help this hunter kill it. I dismounted and casted a shadowbolt on it, and instantly the demon just despawns.
---
The hunter keyboard turned to face me, I shrugged and mounted away. I later found out about the hunter quest line and how badly I fucked that guy over.
---
I actually still think about that from time to time.
---
A fix for this would be a simple player blacklist.  Warlock was griefing in the last dungeon?  I’ll wait for a group without said player.
---
 Classic+. Treat it like runescape oldschool and go in heavy for customer input and polls.
---
The vendor meta wont last another month I dont reckon
---
While it lasts, I'm buying all copper bars and converting them into bombs, and all linen cloth and converting them into bags for an ok profit
---
But give it a month or two and the AH will be the primary way of hitting the mount cap by 40
---
Rogue, so dominant in open world environments. And you don’t have to rely on others what so ever. However, warrior is gonna be a lot more fun if you have a healer with you.
---
This is the million dollar question. You are delusional if you think they would go the Classic Expansion route and leave 1.13 running tho.
---
Confound your lousy toll, troll!
---
Definitely the expac route. Would love to play through BC and WotLK again.
---
Talent trees. Press N after lvl 10.
---
usually the way it works is your completed characters stay on their server and a new seasonal one launches.
---
While I think we should at least have a barbershop in the game I also think part of the game that makes you really hooked is learning to love the monstrosity you created and have to look at.
---
Classic+. But only after a few years.
---
Option 3 for me, though I'd be interested to see what option 2 may bring.
---
There is a video of a guy from beta grinding 1-40 on mobs (no quests) and he does it in less than 3 days played and has about 200g.
---
Kara nights were definitely some of my favorite WoW memories. I wish more raids had a focus on immersion like that.

Do you think your funny or something?
---
Expansions up to WotLK
---
Just here to say that "True Classic" is an absolutely horrible idea, and would have far less people excited about it the second time around. Most people don't want to put hours and hours into a game if it's going to be wiped out in the future.
---
For hunters, wing clip and rank 1 serp sting was a blessing.
---
Aeris dies
---
The problem is that some of those blues can fetch 200-300g on the AH for twink battleground characters once the battlegrounds are released.   Using them for regular leveling can be a huge waste.
---
But yeah, depending on the blue, it's sort've a toss-up for me.
---
they could add different gear sets that arnt a flat power up but rather a boost to certain builds, changin the meta and diversifying the gameplay, which is better than just having a stale game.
---
Oh so you've killed Kel Thuzad and have every legendary in your bank?
---
No, you don't, and in your many years of playing you've never come close.
---
The same will be true this time around as well, there is enough content in classic to last your average players many, many years.
---
If you think classic needs more content then I know for a fact you havnt played much classic at all.
---
Maybe he's not a Potter-tardo?

Mages wreck havoc in pvp in classic

Shit man, I was wondering where this was going.

Please provide an example of a meme integrated into the program? You seem to just hate it without saying anything.
---
I think a lot of it is personal bias. My Discord server has been up for 2.5 years and even if there's a hiccup (which is basically never) you can just switch the server location instantly, a luxury TS doesn't offer.
---
Again, sound is literally the same codec...
---
World pvp is how it should be!
---
Obviously they never intended for it to be possible
---
And when you get something from it like honor or marks or whatever it was on this patch.
---
Nice!

Thanks I'll make sure to check out your private quarters next time.

Disable addons.  My shit went haywire after I updated.

LOL 🤣

you will get better gear from questing than you would in RFC
---
I used to tank quest groups as Enhancement back in the day at 60... it was a lot of fun
---
Just the tip.
---
MADE TO FIGHT CHROMAG
---
A week or so ago my wife and I put together a group for wailing caverns, as horde. Took us about 20 minutes to find three DPS crazy enough. We met in menethil, boated to theramore, swam to ratchet, and fought our way through the horde to the dungeon.
---
We very carefully cleared the entire dungeon, making sure everybody got the quests done and got what gear they could. We were ultra aware of not wiping, because the run back is not short. Nobody left early because we'd already invested so much time into just getting there. After an evening of adventure and dungeoneering we went our separate ways, but when we see each other in stormwind we always share a wave. It wasn't convenient, it wasn't easy, but we made a memory and a connection.
---
Contrast this to LFG. I sit in the safety of ironforge and click a button. With no work on my part, I'm ported to a dungeon. No-one says a word. We clear our way through several bosses. We don't have to be careful because if we die we show up at the front. My item doesn't drop, so I leave the group. There's no downside for me, because it ports me back. There's no downside for the group, because someone else gets plucked out of queue and ported in. There's no consequence for failure, and thus, victory has no meaning.
---
Classic is a social experience, and there should be an emphasis on building relationships. Join guilds, make friend lists, find good people and connect with them. Fuck LFG. Keep that shit with flying and dailies.
---
They already fixed it
---
Wait wait wait...
---
THIS is what the game looks like with the settings on high?! I am playing on the lowest settings possible. It looks like a totally different game... holy shit I'm missing out...
---
The answer to that first question is "My parents played WoW and as a curious child I wanted to play too," and also "I like vidya games." In all seriousness, someone who isn't very social can still get a lot out of MMOs. 
---
I'm not really arguing for or against LFG in Classic, though, I don't really care - Classic dungeons are long af and I don't have the time for them anymore, unfortunately. And I'm only level 12. One day, though.
---
how about locks dude? while  in desolace and there are like 2 quest where u need to go underwater to kill some stuff and there he was  a warrior who was struggling already, trying to get to surface. Buffed him. He whispered me, with thanks and how this is gonna be huge help! yes dude! warlocks buffs matters! #warlocksbuffsmatters!
---
I feel like transit is what makes it an adventure. The game is magical when it can distract you from noticing your repetitive combat rotation, and so much of the streamlining (like flying) was just about removing obstacles between you and endless mob killing.
---
That guy sounds like a jerk, and I would have kicked him from my group.
---
Druids can sort of do everything  
---
sort of.
---
Warriors are gonna be the raid tanks for any "progression" style raiding, but after that when the content is not a challenge, a druid could in theory tank it
---
True classic. No reset.
---
Not sure I agree with this. Warriors were still all MT, you couldn't do Illidan without a Warrior MT and all those Hybrid specs I mentioned you could live without (maybe not shadow priest, those were pretty sweet). You didn't need a ret but he gave a nice buff to melee, same with Booms and Elementals. Also Paladins were fine tanks but they mostly did AOE pulls in dungeons. Everybody had a niche, just like Vanilla, it's just they added more utility.
---
Gotta say though, it was pretty funny watching like 16 mages competing for loot in Asmongolds first MC raid and one 58 warlock grabbing two T1 pieces.
---
I'm a prick ironically. 
---
Honestly, I watched him raid MC, and it was hard to watch more than 10 minutes of it. He was very entitled, demeaned people in his guild, and he wasn't even knowledgeable on the basic requirements of the raid. It became really obvious he didn't do the raid when it was relevant even though he talks about doing it.
---
Grats dude.  I intend to level all classes to 60 then start gearing . To prolong the experience.
---
I'm an aoe mage right now. I fucking hate it. The build sucks fucks dick at anything other than AOE. I also don't have engineering right now. It fucking blows trying to actually kill people. 
---
But you best believe I go back to Hillsbrad and STV and shit on alliance bitches whenever I can. 
---
I might not be able to win a fight vs a green leveled player with any sort of trinkets or PvP spec, but I will fucking roll heads with total reckless abandonment if any horde brethren get fucked with. IDGAF. If it's red it's dead. If I can't dead it I'm going to spend the next 40 minutes sheeping that twat for jumping a horde member. I will find backup. 
---
I will slow every single tick-tack dick gnome and dwarf I come across and CC any fuck wit who tries to back then up. I sure as shit can't 1v1 but I will die with no remorse if it means those coal gogglers go down with me. I'll fucking teleport into a god forsaken pack of filth to take down some mother fuckers. Idc if I get deaded again, my undead ass will be taking as many as I can with me. 
---
Ohhhh and those fuckers better quiver when I get to 60 and can get a right proper spec and have nothing else to do but collect their bones to fill 1k needless with their sorry excuse for remains.
---
Have you thought of making an alt, catching up to her and leveling with her in the meantime?
---
I swam from westfall at lv20, Druid so 50% faster, but safe as long as you stick far enough out for there to be no mobs :P
---
At 32 a boat to theramore and a walk to ratchet is most likely easier thougg
---
Pummel also shows up way late into the game. :(
---
This is so cringe it drained my soul and got a soul shard
---
How about just leaving the damn game pure as it is?
---
I like being able to pull out pokemon red and play Pokemon red.
---
I like being able to pull out Super Mario 64 and play super Mario 64.
---
I don't want to have classic morphed into another unrecognizable abomination.
---
What part about CLASSIC, do you people not understand?
---
When it comes to classics, you leave them the fuck alone, you don't change them because you think you know better or because your worried it will go stale... It is a CLASSIC, sooner you idiots understand that the better.
---
Click harder
---
Type \join lookingforgroup. Mage spam is typically on trade.
---
I hated it the moment it was introduced.
---
But it was so hard to resist.
---
Oh cool, fairest way to go.
---
But that begs the question, how far has it needed to go before? Surely the second roll has matched at least once and a third performed, but I wonder how far it goes. Probably never know, just like how I want to know how big the biggest ever windfury chain was....
---
Classic+ for sure, just look how it worked out for OSRS, blizzard can definetly pull something similar off if they listen to the community.
---
[Gnomish]: aback t g a a c b
---
Eh...not quite like retail and mistakes were incredibly punishing but BC was much harder. There's also the fact that many people you play with (up on that end of the leveling curve) know what they're doing and can keep themselves alive decently.
---
Go finish levelling.
---
Idk if you noticed homie, but that's an alt. He's got engineering goggles, prob has 150/150 skill and an assload of consumables.
---
absolute nonsense, the people who hit 60 week one are largely people who played private servers, not retail.
---
Improved warriors
---
And then what?
---
After the plenty of content and years are done, then what?
---
When all the phases are rolled out and everyone has naxx on farm, then what?
---
You're also going around telling people what their experiences, which is a clear red flag to everyone here.
---
Mazzranache is awesome. Can't decide who to release though, gotta learn pet moves. It's between him and the rake.
---
Mindless levelling leads to poor understanding of the class mechanics which causes issues in dungeons. 
---
Also some genius told the noob hunters they should pull instead of the tank and nothing a tank says will change their minds
---
lol If you’re being literal, you don’t really “need” anything. It’s a video game. I need 300g more than I need an item upgrade for 10 levels. Needing BOE blues and epics is the classic way.
---
Can we get classic to be the level squish hey had planned for retail pls? I love a stupid high triple digit level for retail
---
It's fun to fly around. I don't think anyone argues against that. What's not fun is the empty world that flying creates.
---
Yeah actually have a warrior to level with her! The problem is she plays only at a pc bang (one of 40,000 Korean pc cafes) and does not have a wow subscription so she can’t level at home. Normally I level my rogue at my own pace whenever and when she gets on at pc bang I play my warr with her (same exact quest and everything)
---
Classic+, if it has TBC specs. Always wanted TBC without flying
---
You can also type /who mage and it will list all mages online. Then you can directly message mages asking them to do it.
---
twink is a character you have at a specific level (19 is a common one) solely to but the BEST gear on them and the top level enchants, so you end up with these god-like low level characters that destroy in battlegrounds and arenas
---
1 and 2 concurrently so in case they screw up classic plus we have insurance
---
Who the hell would want the servers to reset lol. That sounds awful. I would prefer shit just get stagnant.
---
Im in a guild with around 250 memebers with 20-60 on at any given time and i didnt even search for it. Just ran a dungeon with one of the guys. And im not even on one of the "main" servers like faerlina. 
---
If youre on a pvp server you didnt even hit a contested zone by 17 lol
---
Twink characters will attempt to get a set of bis gear for a battleground level range so they can dominate. So lvl 10-19, 20-29 etc. Those items close to the upper tier of each bracket will be worth a lot more because those "twinks" want them. 
---
Issue is battlegrounds aren't out yet so if you get one of those items there is a chance it might be better to hold on to them as the price will go up when battlegrounds are released.
---
TBC and then new unique content
---
I agree Arena should still be a part of the game, i just think the focus it got over battlegrounds was a problem.  Arena getting rated modes with higher tiered rewards while BGs were just for farming honor for welfare epics was a backwards design.  Arena should've been the for fun mode that only served as an honor farm while BGs should've been the premier PvP mode with ratings and seasonal rewards.
---
None of these.
---
Roll an alt, try tanking, try healing.
---
Do you have 10 max level classes?
---
The game doesn't have to last forever.
---
No game does.
---
Just fucking leave it alone.
---
There are enough dungeons where you can't just aoe pull and bomb everything down. 
---
Of course a mage will always be better than a rogue in AoE pulls, but there is also other content besides 5man dungeons at end game where other classes can also be a lot more competitive with mages.
---
Please not classic+
---
These classes basically scream for their BC additions at least. I'd only be okay with classic+ if we still saw addition of abilities from further xpacs.
---
I agree, part of the reason I don't play a hybrid now is because all they do is heal. Especially with the prevalence of "meme spec" which is what people call you if you're a shadow priest or a ret Paladin. It's kinda bad design for only 1 spec of the three to be viable, TBC fixed a lot of that using Vanilla principles. They didn't just buff everyone's damage, they added utility to the specs. That's perfect.
---
Classic + new expansions for classic.
---
1: Classic Progression Servers. Basically, the server starts with Classic with the full feature set of the last patch, but it only ships with Molten Core and Onyxia. After they're cleared, the next content block drops- ZG and BWL, and the green dragon world bosses for example- and once those are cleared, then AQ and then finally Naxxaramas. Two months later characters are 'ambered' and given to players to either move to another server- either as-is, or rolled back to their last 'finalized' state between two content blocks so someone decked in Naxx40 gear doesn't go to a freshly rolled over server- or brought back into the retail ecosystem. 
---
2: Progression Servers. Same idea as Classic except each time the final raid is cleared, two weeks (maybe a month? Give people some time off) later the next expansion drops and the cycle repeats.
---
3: Classic+. New zones, dungeons and raids are introduced to the Classic ecosystem given the existing game state. Zones are specifically designed to help address some consistency issues- the Horde might get an entire extra zone or a quest patch to address the imbalance of quests, class specs that were paper-viable but lacking gear might get class quests and gear drops tailored to their needs, like feral druids or protection paladins- but the core mouth feel of the game doesn't change. You might get Mt Hyjal, but it gets slotted in as a world zone right around where Winterspring sits in terms of mobs and quests. You might get new dungeons, but they're closer to the intent of Diremaul. You might get a new raid, but it'd never outstrip a given block of content.
---
4: Classic++. Same idea as Classic+ but instead of fitting everything to the level 60 paradigm, the game is allowed to evolve with expansion packs that specifically eschew quality of life changes present in retail. No LFD, no LFR. Game design specifically steers into the kind of goofy game play that had people raiding old ass dungeons for obscure nature resistance trinkets, or random items that are absolutely broken for some classes, like the manual crowd pummeler for feral druids.
---
Mages are the best raid dps so you never have too many
---
So tuff
---
That’s cool, doesn’t make it any less frustrating that I’ve been using it to gauge mobs for 8.5 days played. Changes everything now. If that were the case, enforcing since launch would’ve been nice.
---
Twinks are characters that players stop leveling at certain brackets for Battlegrounds (19,29,39...) then get the best items available for that level to completely overpower anyone else in pvp that isn't doing that.
---
With the model of character copies for each expansion I don't see why they wouldn't do both. This is the first time in years they'll have content people actually look forward to and they'd be stupid not to recognize that and capitalize on it.
---
Wintergrasp. It was definitely better than its sequel in Cata, and I think they gave up on the idea after that.
---
Voidwalker: *Why am I hear?*
---
Me: /cast Sacrifice
---
Only the strong make it to level 40+ soldier. If you want a real challenge, roll alliance. 30-40 is absolute hell as horde own everything. Want even more of a challenge? Roll alliance on Stalagg. It's an absolute nightmare.... But when you finally do make it to the high levels, it's so glorious. There are horde everywhere to kill.
---
Yessir
---
Also not sure how it’s “obvious” as I didn’t play vanilla.
---
Yeh I wouldn’t lvl to 60 again if it reset. Knowing it’s going to reset would prevent me from doing just about everything. I’m not sure where this idea came from but whoever thought of it is a dumbass.
---
I would love for them to do the second option.
---
They have to do classic based expansions, but they don't need to not use the content / ideas from retail. I would like them to do several things inspired from what works in other games:
---
1. Keep max level as 60 - Add a form of paragon, that will keep all gear and dungeons valid. Adding 10 levels every few expansions is something that put me off retails completely.
---
2. Scale dungeons by gear - By this I mean make dungeons that require unique gear to beat comfortably. To put simply have an ice dungeon that you need fire armour to beat (but make it a bit more flavoursome). Don't just add more and more levels or damage to things.
---
3. Better Auction House - Please please please get one like the Eve or GW2 market. Classic AH is dam awful even with addons. We need filters for gear bonuses, so we can see what other options we can equip that are similar. We need buy orders so we can keep the AH healthy. The deposits should be reworked, they are just not working as they should, the less an item is sold the lower they should be, and the more the higher they should be. The current system hinders the AH by limiting the risk people are willing to put on things. Add a sell only mode we don't need a bidding system on regular high demand items.
---
4. Encourage social interactions - Never add LFG features / allow for the addons. Make people talk to each other. 
---
--- These following ideas are for the above reasons ---
---
5. NO FLYING MOUNTS. Just rework it so they are cosmetic for the griffins and wyverns.
---
6. No other utility gold sync mounts. They again impact social interactions poorly.
---
7. Fishing - Can we add a more interactive mini-game that works along side the current one, but with some minor buffs. Also, having multiple people on a boat together working hard to land a huge fish would be great fun.
---
8. Achievements - I mean what better way to encourage some rivalries.
---
9. Player histories and alts - Display how long people join guilds for, who their other characters on the servers are and any name/ server changes they have had.
---
10. Guild on Guild alliances / wars - Just because we are all within the same faction doesn't mean we have to like each other.
---
11. Bounties - just like the current quests in game, but you can put them on people who ninja loot / are a jerk. 
---
----
---
If they plan to just keep it as option 1 they would need to some that keeps the game fresh. I would say maybe add seasons to the game like what D3 has. However, in the interest of making it fun add a unique dungeon / drops for the season that only come to the base mode after the season is over. However, they should increase the drops/exp/mat rates a lot to keep the pace manageable. 
---
The third option is just a nope for me. I would just quit.
---
True that people are inherently nice or arseholes, but different games/mechanics also encourage different behaviours.
---
Expansions
---
dEaD gAmE
---
Don't believe it was No Dice that I was in, but I just saw badges was in that. I remember him sitting on the pole outside org calling it the 2k pole (then 2.2, then 2.4k) as his arena rating increased. He wouldn't duel anyone except some undead warrior who would always win.
---
 Then they moved to frostmourne.
---
I like it because the ground under my feet is less cool looking than the top half of my screen. So the UI covers up a bit of dirt road and I get to see more trees and sky.
---
&lt;39 I had a bit under 40% iirc. &gt;40 with barely decent gear, I'm just below 50%
---
I enjoying tanking, makes me feel wanted unlike IRL. Though I think I'm totally useless at it.
---
Technically there was Zul'aman at some point during TBC as well.
---
Oh, of course! That'd be amaaazing. I love the fantasy fulfillment part of WoW more than the epic gear, endgame street cred, PvP... actually traveling to the dungeon on a slow af mount in a grand adventure mixed with quality-of-life convenience would be right up my alley.
---
Did you respond to the wrong person?
---
Lets be real. They're gonna do option 3, because all it requires is spinning up new servers and probably some fixes to the legacy code to get it to work. Classic+ costs development time which costs money. This is an Activision company, they're gonna take the quick and easy cash grab.
---
JUST MAKE TRUE CLASSIC 4K!!!
---
The whole "we need new content and we need it now" attitude is what screwed wow over in the first place.
---
You idiots are literally repeating history.
---
Just leave it.
---
I got one of these after I had just replaced it
---
amen. The real problem is that people who play the game are usually the absolute worst designers for it. They always want to remove the "pain points", even if those add depth to the game.
---
Imp with faster fireballs &gt; all.
---
Change my mind
---
I just want my quests completed
---
SM fam
---
Because the future direction of the game starts being developed now. It takes years to develop MMO content.
---
It has not started yet.
---
I never help them. If they give up before they get to 60 they can never take my spot in the raid.
---
Had a bit of fun today. Was in Barrens like always and saw a guy practicly begging for a tank to come help him and his group with WC.
---
So I did the thing and came to help even tough I bearly get any exp or gear worth while there anymore. I thought I would help out.
---
Turns out they had no mage and no preist. All of them we’re level 17-18 and thus we didn’t have any AoE. Only dots to break any cc we had.
---
This is where we would defy all odds and clear the intire dugeon in record time, but that didn’t happen.
---
I was the only one with a firm grasp of how agro works, and for the first half of the dugeon also the only one intrested in protecting our healer.
---
It was a nightmare of up to 4-6 corpse runs for all of us due to pretty dumb pulling of mobs, blatant ignoring of who the tank was focusing and a healer with a deathwish. And ofc lacking dps or massive dps before taunts were in place.
---
It took us three hours.
---
But we did it.
---
It was time wasted, but not for them.
---
But you know.
---
I’m never playing with any of them again, fuck that.
---
Haha, had this happen to me as well one time I ran BFD. After the ork boss one of our guys was standing stumped in front of the the door, wonder how to open the door in vanilla. Someone responded that you need to light the braziers, and I thought I better add that they need to be lit one at a time, but it was already too late. It easy added 50% to our time spent there but at least we finished it.
---
Slightly off topic... do they post what they change in the classic patches anywhere?
---
jesus christ
---
You should have waited, but you didnt have to as the game rules allows otherwise. I would probably just ignore you and move on :-)
---
I went into STV the other day, admittedly too low level, but I wanted to see if I could at least knock out the first Kurzen quest and the young panther and tiger quests. A warrior whispered me and asked if I could help him. I said sure. I was invited to a group of three warriors grinding trolls in, fuck I forget the name of the ruins, Jubal'Wal? in the northwest. 
---
We killed hundreds of trolls. One guy said thanks after a while and dropped group. We picked up another. Another guy said thanks and dropped group. We picked up another. We killed some horde. The horde killed us more. One guy said he was good, and he would just take Rez sickness and hearth because he was finished. That's when  someone asked me how many more I needed. 
---
Needed? Needed what?
---
 I didn't need any. I said so. "I don't have a quest here." 
---
He asked, "what the hell are you doing here then?"
---
"Well you asked if I could help. So I helped." 
---
He was like, "Jesus Christ, dude, why didn't you say you didn't have a quest here?"
---
"I'm a team player, yo. Hit me up if you need anything."
---
It's ALL about community.
---
but then you're being horde scum and we can't have that
---
Classic + !!
---
Personally I find AOEing much more fun than questing. I do still quest occasionally tho. In the end lvling in general isnt fun for me at all.
---
I don’t have a problem with “meme” specs. Yeah they’re considered such in raids but shadow priests, ret paladins, enhance/element shaman, etc are viable and even good for pvp/leveling/questing/5 mans.
---
Just make the whole thing classic plus. Improve on the game and expand on the story. But hold true to the magic that the game creates in each player that actually gives accomplishments meaning. I feel like wow went down a path that has ended where nothing has meaning, and there is nothing to work towards that warrants the amount of time it takes. Take the mounts for example or Tier sets. And don’t fuck the gold economy
---
I’m gonna get one tomorrow I think. It’s been really rainy this week and giving fall vibes and I’m so ready
---
If classic Wrath comes out I'll actually play that.
---
I wish we could get another sub, like "classic discussions" and just ban all the memes, all the "my gf made this!" posts and talk about gameplay. It would be less active but it would mean a lot less trash to wade through.
---
Shield is just better for smooth runs. 2h tanks can be unpredictable to heal when you get an overpull.
---
In wow terms, if someone doesn't hit lvl 20 they never really "got into the game".
---
Only a game like wow would I say "Oh the 10-20 hours you spent didn't really count", but that's where we are.
---
Keep questing. Quests and vendor prices on items increases quite a bit after 40.
---
A low pop server is about a little more than a high vanilla server 
---
When they open a new server thatcstarts outcasts Transfer only meaning no one can create characters there it’ll be dead for a bit 
---
You probably won’t reach 60 beforecthey open paid transfers is my guess 
---
Also the new servers are growing afaik
---
True classic for a few years, then TBC
---
after 40 you'll make the 90g up super quick, youll probably just end up with your mount at 45 or something
---
The game is massive...  Nothing would "stop the real world" but classic has a big impact relative to other games.   It's a phenom just like it was before.
---
Its working out great for OSRS.
---
Aside from the recent rs3 devs moving over and trying to force rs3 graphics, most updates are on point.
---
If you think they came up with that idea, you haven't been paying attention.
---
I feel like it's got to be "Classic+", because being locked in 1.12 forever won't be good for longevity, but just moving through the expansions leads us back down the road where at some point the game got bad then worse. Where do they stop? When they get to WoD or BfA do they just say "okay, far enough, now back to vanilla"? Or do they only loop through the pre-Cata expacs as Cata really signifies the expac where changed? Or do they stay 15 years behind retail forever in a moving release cycle?
---
I think Classic+ could be scary because it's botchable, but I think it's the only option with a clear path moving forward.
---
Yup indeed!
---
The classes get fun at around 20-25+ because if new abilities - try and look them up to see what would fit you and your style
---
in ARPGs we call this a starter character. it makes even more sense to play WoW this way cause of rested xp for alts.

---
Aye!
---
Some people can't be helped, I guess. Enjoy your private server meta.
---
Haven’t tried that yet tbh!
---
I have it. I hate posting on it because of it spamming channels. No point to spamming lfg stockade when I am in a completely different zone. If they made an option to turn that off be fine.
---
Except for the fact that they have a 100% chance of fucking this up
---
We had Elemental and Enhancement Shaman, Shadow Priests and Ret Paladins on Kil'Jaeden progress so I guess I had a different experience then you. You're correct in that they didn't do as much damage as non-hybrids but they were still useful. That's all I'm asking for, usefulness and then if you have a skilled player he can maybe be competitive, like top 10 in damage. I think that's reasonable.
---
Personally, I fully support cross server battlegrounds as long as everybody on one team is from the same server. Some of the faction imbalances on retail are so severe that you'd never be able to find a BG if your opponents *had* to be from the opposite faction of your server.
---
That was smooth Boss.
---
Not new, just not yet patched in.
---
I'm talking 3 years after Naxx comes out. 
---
It will have been on farm for a long time by the time any new Classic+ content is added, I guarantee it
---
Gurubashi Arena be like
---
MOOO!
---
Nah, gotta have at least 3 people disconnected, 2 in queue, and a dozen people getting less than 5 fps while staring at a wall if we're gonna go OG vanilla.
---
Classic expansions on new servers would be a nightmares for Guids and people wanting to keep their unique names.
---
Sometime in Wrath of the Lich King around 10 of us had an expedition where we wall jumped, levitated, feared, charged, and death gripped, and mind controlled an entire group to the top of the mountain and summoned people up there. It probably took around 2 hours to get everybody up there inch by inch but it was one of the more joyous adventures I had in the game. We named the mountain, Mount Herb
---
No, i like PvP. I dont like standing there for 3 seconds as a skull wrecks me. That's not PvP.
---
I just want classic and then stagnation when all the content is released though i doubt blizz moneymaking will allow that
---
Thanks for that, clarified my post. 😉👍
---
And literally every zone
---
Classic+ all the way, really do not want classic with the same expansions released again
---
Add arena in from BC as well and im in!

Well its 6:30 am...
---
If they ever deleted one of my toons to "start a server over" I would stop playing all of WoW forever.
---
I would hate to put all that time and effort into something that is just going to be deleted.
---
Pretty sure Blizzard would never do that.
---
I would prefer Classic+ but I would also take BC and Wrath servers.
---
The games direction has already been decided.
---
Its staying classic.
---
Yes but this is exactly the problem I'm talking about. 5 years from now you 100% will not be able to "quit and come back and pick up where you left off" because 90% of your server will have long surpassed you. If everybody is on raid Tier 9.5 and you're picking back up on Tier 2, you're outclassed and trying to LFG for 3 year old content that everybody else will have done dozens of times
---
Um... yes? Can I have all of those please?
---
I want all those options.
---
You're gonna trace those rays and you're gonna like it!
---
I would love to play WotLK again, so so much.
---
It crashes my pc and I can’t figure why
---
Class quests to unlock talents at 60
---
The best are advices like: "that's classic for ya, gotta grind at least 2-3 levels every 10 levels because you can't level with quests alone".
---
It's amazing how people think walking around and switching zones every 5+ quests is boring but will grind the same mobs for hours on end "because others say so".
---
Annoylingly, as you level, you're going to have to continuously switch between the two. You will come across a LOT of Main Hand only weapons that are too good to not use, and none of them will be daggers. Also, leveling as swords is more efficient, if you care about efficiency.
---
I have managed to use daggers to 28 with only levels 16-19 using a sword MH, but it would have just been more efficient to spec swords and stick to swords.
---
I started playing in Classic, but didn't really own an account until WotLK. While Classic is awesome, especially compared to retail, TBC was like a more refined and polished version of Classic without trodding on ghe experience with post-TBC design. In my opinion if we had that, but removed flying, I think the game would be at its peak.
---
They didn't respond, no way to know if they're doing or done the quest. Don't mind them.
---
&gt;Maybe we could also add gearscore or relevant achievements
---
OH FUCK NO
---
We're doing SM atm and we're more or less fighting 10ish or more things at a time. It's going okay its just a real bitch to hold aggro
---
I think the second option is best. Maybe releasing the expansions isn’t the worst thing in the world but do it differently. As I’ve played classic I realise that what makes it so good is the need to interact with other players. Wow has spent years trying to bring the war back into Warcraft but what they failed to do was put the mmo into the mmo, In fact they removed it entirely. 
---
While it slows the game down it also makes it more rewarding. I love the fact that I can’t just buy am enchant off the ah.i love the need to organise a group to be able to do a dungeon, or that I can’t be a pally on the horde. 
---
In retail I’ve never felt more alone. Grinding quests silently, killing elites with little more effort that the mobs around me. If I want to dungeon I click a button and then keep questing, Tele in, do the run, tele out.If I want to raid I wonder to the ah buy everything I need (fully geared for the easy mode raids with all the dungeon greens I have )and then Looking for raid. I can see all the content that I ever want.m without ever needing to talk to someone.
---
This doesn’t mean that we can’t have any QoL changes, like summoning stones, still requiring two people help keeps the community interaction alive while helping players to do certain dungeons. Just ones that don’t subtract from the core concept of wow, community.
---
Sounds like a blast. Ironforge to stormwind If that helps
---
Do you kill mobs a few lvls below you?
---
Haha genocide
---
It’s too early to say what I want. After a year or two of being level 60 and just clearing MC and Onyxia and Blackwing Lair and Naxxramus I could say bring in the next expansion or I might just keep loving it and say don’t change a thing.
---
I have about 60 hours worth of Gatherer data across all zones with black lotus/rich thorium
---
There are unknown variables on both computers: connection type, NIC specs, RAM, CPU, HDD/SSD free space (yes this can play a role), GPU, OS, just to name some.
---
True classic with character reset is an awful idea unless it's like, 1 server out of 20.
---
Classic+ sounds sweet.
---
Classic expansions is not convincing me.
---
Yep, welcome to the "Alliance" been like this forever.
---
Blizzard should add retail's LFG tool if you ask me. It's basically exactly what you're describing. You list your group and wait for players to apply.
---
I've had a lot of situations where I form a posse (from general) to help clear out the scum. It's a fun dynamic.
---
I'd be happy with just a straight up reboot. Progress the game forward as it did in the past but maybe with some modern changes. IMO a lot of people are playing classic because it's "new". If you try to force things like no flying you'll push away a lot of potential players. I'm playing because I both want to experience real classic but also because it's new to me and I do enjoy the game as a whole.
---
Personally i want an AU, Blizz knows the expansions the community hates so what if... Cataclysm never happened... what if WOD never happened
---
Mine gets hot too. That’s just how they react to gaming.
---
I tried to do this today and the hunter who was being neutral with me saw me casting and killed me :(
---
I say they start a NEW line of expansions from classic without fucking it up and not repeating the same mistakes as last time.
---
becasue you have a free and fast underground transport from stormwind to ironforge so they say that it was balanced
---
Classic expansions...
---
That was such a fun event! Grob Mob FTW!
---
Chill out, why are you butthurt? 
---
Go take your meds, cool off, eat your crayons.
---
I got most of my clams at Steamweedle Port in Tanaris.
---
But there seem to be a bug sometimes, where you only get an empty loot window. Don't bother fishing then and try it another time.
---
if it's a canine or feline pet I feel bad, bird pets I feel kinda bad, any others I would leave to fight mobs solo
---
Games like WoW kind of come with the knowledge you're getting into more than just a videogame to hop around in. It's not quite signing up for a job, or a cult, or a lifestyle retreat, but it's a little of each. If you're just looking to hop into something and have a blast, there are just a million options that don't require a monthly fee, heavy time investment, and archaic even for it's time gameplay. 
---
Honestly if you're the kind of person who tries WoW and just has no interest in signing up for more of the same, consider yourself blessed.
---
How could you play vanilla without using the ah ever?
---
yes, im doing the same thing, but more then 80% of the threads are kinda boring or useles :/
---
I really don't see what that gripe has to do with retail anyway. There are still PvP servers in modern WoW...
---
If you DO want to go the Twitch route, FriendsInfo does this as well. Despite the name, they don't need to be in your friend's list.
---
I have the opposite problem... too many quests filling up my log I can’t find where they’re actually tryna point me so I wander aimlessly and pick up 1-2 more quests on the way
---
Bless your kindness. It’s expensive leveling as a warrior due to eating after every fight ;)
---
Autistic?
---
But having these 3 versions simultaneously available means that they would refresh each other (at least that's how private servers worked for me).
---
E.g. Got bored of TBC? Try WotLK for a while. Got bored of WotLK? You haven't played Classic in almost two years, why not go back to that?
---
If you think my desperation has an end, you're in for a depressing surprise.
---
I haven't downloaded yet but are you able to limit the decimal point to like 3 decimals instead of like 12?
---
Lmao tbh
---
We have a Fruit Vendor guild over on Atiesh too! Makes me giggle.
---
&gt;You're so fucking wrong I'm honestly just gonna stop. I can't argue with a brick wall of a person. You can reply whatever you want at this point.
---
It's literal basic math.
---
Much rather be playing though
---
To try and get this: https://classicdb.ch/?item=1482
---
When twinks are a thing (when WG comes to Classic) it will sell for tons!
---
Classic expansions is the only thing that's going to happen.
---
I would like new refresh servers which could be classed as "seasons" and have blizzard run random events on them.
---
Why many words when few words do trick?
---
🙃 I'm not jealous....
---
they are often in guilds known to have been pre formed from pserver or openly say it.  Or I ask them directly how they're so skilled at a game that was unable to be played in its original state for more than 10 years. They'd say they played several toons on pservers
---
1400 hours on my old RS3 account with one 99 skill reporting in
---
What a strange way to spell "I am a pussy"
---
Its a common theme across all games, the players who enjoy playing the game are playing the game instead of camping out in the forums. Trolls, idiots and bored people who aren't even interested in playing the game are.
---
There needs to be an attunement system for posting.
---
Lol no. If equal skill mage should always win versus a rogue. If you use thisle tea then you might be able to win.
---
But there were catch up mechanics in vanilla. Both DM and Zul'Gurub rewards catch-up gear.
---
Yeah I've got my sub from classic, maybe I'll jump on retail to see if I can find out what hat old guild was
---
Only problem is that scarlet gives so much amazing loot and exp while meanwhile the 30 to 40 areas have terrible quests are overcrowded and there are not enough mobs
---
I want them to go pretty unchanged through Vanilla, maybe add a few QoL changes like guild banks or barber shops. Then I really wamt BC and LK because those are WoW for me, and then Classic-specific content
---
Vanilla Virgins
---
The lower the level, the greater the aggro distance. I had issues my first few runs in SM because I was a bit low and kept body pulling mobs the tank was intending to skip.
---
The classic expansion route makes little sense to me, why would people want to follow the route that got us to retail lol? Also doing that would make the previous expansion servers die out slowly.
---
Honestly, I’m so happy for classic I’m not trying to think about the future, I’m just enjoying it now that it’s finally here :) I kinda think that blizzard backed themselves into a weird corner with this one though
---
Also new and I think it's because a lot of warriors are tanks? So they don't do a lot of damage and can't heal themselves... Has to make grinding mobs a complete bitch. I'm a 23 warrior but I focus on the DPS side of things so I usually don't have a problem but I think that's why everyone helps warriors out. We also don't have many attacks that aren't single target(at least I don't yet), so if you agro more than one enemy it becomes pretty hectic very fast.
---
What's a dig, you mean like like?
---
I felt this way about my hunter pets in retail. Something about seeing the happiness meter in classic and the fact that I have to feed him to bring it back up makes me more attached though. I try very hard to keep my pet alive and only let him die when there is no other option. It might also be that I named my pet after my cat and my in game pet is also a black cat.
---
Oh, good to know, thanks!
---
At least fifty.
---
Most people already have the shoulders at this point, so for exp runs its standard just to reset after clearing both sides of the cathedral
---
**Classic Expansions** for sure. Think about it, if they release Classic through MoP, one expansion each year, that would give us 5 straight years of enjoyment without controversy from Blizzard screwing things up. No way I want 2019 ActiBlizzard in charge of rewriting WoW history. 
---
Just let the game play out like it did originally with only patches for game breaking bugs. IMO there’s was not a single thing wrong with how they made WoW until Cata. Shoot, maybe not until WoD if I’m not too picky.
---
To expand on my other comment, it really depends on the kind of the mob you're grinding at the time.
---
\&amp;#x200B;
---
Some ogres in Arathi for example have a kind of enrage, that makes their hits hurt quite a bit. So those are a bit meh due to the fact that my shield breaks quickly and I need to heal myself more often. 
---
Same with some of the Syndicate mobs that hit fast &amp; hard.
---
More heals = more mana used = less mana for spells = more wanding = longer kill time
---
Other mobs, like Snapjaw turtles in Hillsbrad/Alterac barely get through the shield at all, so I need a renew every 2-3 mobs maybe. That means I have more mana available to put another spell into the rotation. 
---
So turtles might make sense to grind at the same level or even when they're a level above you, whereas Ogres/Syndicate mobs are probably easier when below you.
---
Censusclassicplus
---
Definitely Classic +
---
Nice one!
---
Niece
---
I mean, anything is debatable because this is subjective and we're talking about a video game. But you are literally the first person I have ever seen call Cataclysm the best expansion. WOTLK and TBC are popular picks. Even MoP and Legion fans are out there. But Cata? You are alone in that opinion, my friend.
---
It's already confirmed we'll be getting additional classic content.
---
Hey! Thank you so much! My buddies are gonna be stoked!
---
Where can I find this data? I'm curious about the breakdown on my server
---
grind beasts, sell their stuff, pick a spot with high density like raptors behind arena in stv, if its crowded move on.
---
But he can actually mooo at him with /s Ä 1 1 1 1 1
---
A lot of tanks at 60 are actually fury warriors that just want fast runs. That's why they don't want you taking the fury loot. Prot loot in general isn't exciting at all because it all just gets defaulted to the tank, both in dungeons and raids. While you're raiding you have to actually force warriors to take it because they're all just saving for dps pieces and don't want to miss out even if they got 3 tier pieces.
---
I just went hybrid. Permafrost + improved blizzard is too useful to ignore, but shatter + ice shards is necessary on a pvp server. I gave up frostbite, arctic reach, piercing ice, and frost channeling to make it happen but no regrets so far, I can AoE big pulls and still drop massive crits in STV.
---
Are you on Fairbanks? Because my guild raids duskwood every Wednesday afternoon
---
What, I'm not a hunter, don't know what's going on.
---
Reddit and discord sensus are always wrong, unless you want to measure how many reddit/discord users actually fill in polls.
---
There is no way besides blizzard as far as I know.
---
I wouldn't mind all 3 options
---
Nope. Easiest way is to park an alt with the gold there and check before you log for the night and before you start.
---
Well some BiS gear would change and some wouldn't. Give some great gear to make alternative specs viable. Prot paladin gear that boots threat or taunts won't throw off the BiS for holy paladin.
---
As a level 23 warrior, and completely new to WOW, I've had a similar experience. I was told before I started playing that a warrior HAS to have good gear, and I've found that to be true.
---
Wrath was pretty good
---
I kinda want all three to be honest. I think classic+ would be the best opportunity to push content though. 
---
But I can’t help but want to play blood elves again.
---
a dynamic respawn rate was in classic and it is working as it did in vanilla,
---
therey are just more people around
---
Wotlk was not the best expansion. That’s where the game died and people started massively quitting. There was a steady growth all through vanilla and tbc. Then in wotlk the player base stopped growing, even though there were new players joining all the time. Most of my pvp friends quit. 
---
I personally kept playing, hoping they would fix the garbage one day, but they never did (class homogenization, kid friendly gameplay - not rewarded for playing well, not punished for playing badly - the same dungeon in 3-4 different difficulties instead of actual real progression, cc and burst given to all classes, 5 second mana rule removed, threat limitation removed as a factor in pve, daily and weekly quests that felt like work, the inability to ever catch up if you missed a week in arenas, boring rotations introduced forcing us to press a button on every global cooldown with infinite mana and resources). Honestly I could complain about wotlk for hours. The end of TBC was when activision merged with blizzard and they ruined the game
---
Just ease in for a few talents until you get used to it.
---
So I’m building my first PC in a few days as to my parts are going to arrive, I’d like to read more about what settings to apply for classic as well as the pc in general,  a friend helped me set up a guide on PC builder, all the  parts are pretty much: [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/9zLrxr/great-intel-gamingstreaming-build) 
---
The only thing I changed was the tower, into the NZXT 510 Elite ( I read reviews after ordering it) but I honestly splurged for the convenience of the RGBs already attached, as well as the color scheme.
---
If anyone has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it!
---
Sick comeback.
---
Inb4 finish leveling bro for the third time.
---
Have had a hard time finding a group as hunter since a lot of peeps want either spell or meleecleave.  Seems like I need to try and find a group today. Thanks fam.
---
I'd like BC with the only change being to add flying only to specific areas that require it. Eg. The netherdrake zone, some places daylies send you to, etc.
---
Alternatively I'd also be alright with normal burning crusade. As I really just wanna play burning crusade. Classic is nice and all, but BC is my goal.
---
The first off wasn't bad. When you still had to run to the instance etc. But it stil chips away at server community.
---
Great source. Mine is basic math as well.
---
Overwatch server where the female characters are nude
---
Yeah I like how it says 'oc' but that was the intended joke.
---
Ship no longer insta zones. You have to cross the ocean in real time or airship at real speeds.
---
He’s not shooting from the hip.  As for sideways, plenty of people shoot at an angle, most pros for instance.
---
Classic is not just about old content. It is about a design philosophy that the devs abandoned over 10 years ago.
---
I will gladly welcome new content in Classic so long as it conforms to the design philosophy of Classic.
---
Why did you roll on a pvp server then?
---
With the Detect Greater Invisibility warlock buff you can see the ghosts of the citizens of Lordaeron when entering Undercity.
---
Is there like a Classic LFG chat channel option, because if I see another “lfg gnomer” in dun morogh general chat I’m going to radiation bomb gnomeragon again
---
If it's a group of 5 not much they can do is there? If they didn't even bother to say 'sorry full' though i wouldn't feel that bad about stealing it. You shouldn't be able to steal if from 5 players anyway unless they're all asleep.
---
Ah.. sorry dude.. That shits lame as hell.
---
Is your connection good? Or is there a firewall or any other things limiting your bandwidth, like background downloads or a limiter on your PC?
---
Yep agree, TBC was so good
---
Thanks dude! I got to go and check gorilla loot tables.
---
*laughts in Rogue*
---
Alamoo approves
---
I'm going to get dogpiled for this, but I loved MoP. I've always played Druids, and I played the tabletop RPG for ages. So... Pandarians weren't as much of a shock to me. Even still play the  5e Warcraft every Monday!
---
are you okay ?
---
Until zg its the only pet (rare) that has 1.0 attackspeed which is considered best for pvp for spell pushback
---
Better yet, practice kiting the mob with r1 as reapplying it so it doesn't tick and you can easily get 100 skillups from one mob kiting in a circle.  Can be a grey mob too
---
Hey there TrueKingsman we actually made a tool over at ClassicRaids to [find a leveling partner in wow classic ](https://wow.classicraids.com/characters)!  It's worth a shot and a lot of players have their discord on there.  Let me know if you have any questions or need help with the player lookup :)
---
Doubt classic plus will happen. They'd have to use artisists, digital artists, team to code the content, test it and a creative team. It's a lot of work.
---
im 29 and Im at 35% (about 1490 armor)
---
ClassicGuide I think
---
helb
---
Although TBC end game was exceptional, TBC levelling was kinda shit. Additionally, I’ve never liked the 10 level per expansion model because it devalues pre-max level content and everyone just rushes to max.
---
Do you know how to read?
---
Dude if you're going to rant spend 5 seconds looking up Reddit formatting because I guarantee you no one is going to read that wall of bat shit crazy.
---
No, you think it's better than the auto grouping dungeon finder, which is a different mechanic than the group finder tool.
---
Then he health pots and kills you.
---
Giving the players what they want is what ruined WoW in the first place though...
---
Whatever it ends up being, you should post your guild to our [guild list for wow classic](https://wow.classicraids.com/guilds) to help with your guild recruitment needs!
---
If you have a high aggro producing attack you can aggro mobs and take them away from where the person wants to be.
---
Priests can aoe fear the mobs mages are trying to aoe farm. Works with anyone trying to farm, but this is the best case.
---
When somebody asks for a mage portal make it for somewhere else. People often click on it without looking where it goes.
---
I've read when somebody is trying to open a chest you can open a trade with them to cancel it.
---
Advertise you're doing a dungeon. When they join the group you, a warlock, and a buddy summon them to a random location.
---
I outplayed this man twice.
---
1st time: saw him ganking the troll, so I went to try and help. Mage kept polymorphing me while my dots whittled him away. He forgot DR was a thing and just kept trying to poly me while I whittled him away with my wand and dots.
---
2nd time: he rezzed and found me, slammed me with frostbolts and I died nearly instantly. I had a soulstone on myself, he knew that, thought he was outplaying me by running a little away and waiting for me to use it. I used it, ran off, he caught up, I feared him and managed to hearth away to safety.
---
Thrall did 9/11
---
ESH. They definitely should have said something, but it was pretty shitty of you to ninja the quest. They were probably waiting there a while and no doubt tabbed out or looking at talents or whatever, and not paying attention to chat. The proper etiquette for you would have been to wait.
---
Make the thorium brotherhood reputation or, any classic reputation actually mean something. Example add quest that give you items or crafting plans.  Add to low level crafting. Let a level 20 blacksmith actually farm and craft weapons and armor that are green and blue item levels with a good bonus for having the set. Back in the day as a level 50 orc I collected all the Matts and made the imperial armor set. I still have the notepad I scribbled all the mats on for each piece. Some of the items were Green and worthless but it looked cool.  Give me more items sets to craft.
---
You are a good person:D
---
To be fair if the boss is 4-5 or more levels above you your not going to do any damage as a dps anyway so you might as well tank.
---
I would love classic with small changes every now and then, then eventually a classic plus. I don’t want them to rush classic too fast, but I think some nice quality of life changes and balance changes could improve the game.
---
Yeah no
---
Just ignore the children and make a normal group on your own
---
Hello, thank you!. Do you know any "coastal area" on Eastern Kingdoms?
---
"the guy's not responding anymore,this must mean I'm right and not just not worth his time"
---
I keep getting asked what I'll do end game since I'm not the best at any role, and I keep replying I'll fill in your role when you inevitably die
---
Wasnt that bad on firemaw. Quested there for about 10 hours. I ganked alot of people.  And only got ganked by:
---
60 rogue once 
---
60 mage once
---
2x 35+ mages about 6 times, then they made me log off.
---
Other than that people left me alone.  And I feel like there more horde than alli on firemaw.
---
*wipes away tear*
---
I believe that the Classic  is the way to go. There is a lot of cut/unfinished content left in the base game.
---
[Further reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8c0t4b/cutunfinished_content/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body)
---
More horizontal progression, making meme-specs more viable, maybe new class in the spirit of vanilla (heck, there was demon hunter on one of the early promo screens).
---
Imagine old model goblins in horde, and old model high elves in alliance.
---
Imagine similar to opening gates of AQ event where Burning Legion is invading and whole realm has to work together.
---
But before adding any content there should be set of ground rules, like no QoL changes (hard earned reward tastes better), no to flying (thats what killed wPvP), each class should be unique with all its strengths and weaknesses.
---
Lets take a quest for epic mounts for Paladin and Warlock, I think we can all agree, it was pretty satisfying to complete, so why not introduce such quest line for other classes (I think retail has sth like that).
---
But let’s be honest, there will be no Classic , it feels like a side project to keep the **old** players happy. Rest of us, looking for new and *exciting* content should switch to retail, because it’s fun right? You buy dis sweet, shiny, sparkly spectral flying toaster for 20 bucks, right?
---
Its too much effort to quest right now for a lot of people. Leveling zones are packed with both factions, pvp, stealing countless mobs, waiting 20+min just to tag a certain enemy, etc. Dungeons are safe and fairly efficient. Sometimes cloth wearers just dont wanna get ganked.
---
Heal yourself with those Tel Abim Banandages
---
I wish I could give you brave souls more than just a heal on my shammy.
---
Option 1 WoW with resets: I think that having it stay classic with no changes and then resetting upon becoming stagnant is possibly the worst option. Don’t get me wrong I love everything about vanilla but a huge part of WoW for me is progress, and losing progress and starting over just doesn’t appeal to me. 
---
Option 2 WoW Classic+: As long as we stay on the theme of Classic (no flying, no QOL “improvements”, and no class homogenization) I’m all for it.
---
Option 3 WoW up to WOTLK: I wouldn’t mind this so much as long as there was no flying or QOL improvements like LFG etc
---
Yeah, I've played a warrior since 2004. You will not take pity on me in this manner. This hardship fuels me to crush it when I am able.
---
Nødt of the people you are describing won't make it past level 40. And they certainly won't be playing two years from now.
---
Uldum has an incredible soundtrack. It perfectly portrays a sort of haunted / corrupt desert atmosphere.
---
Just go enhancement. Same pros, less cons.
---
The very first thing that needs to happen after Naxx, is paladin and druid tanking and Karazhan, all at 60 cap.
---
Yep, it's gone.
---
I liked the look of this so much it was going to be my new tradedispenser replacement.  Easily the most innovative addon idea in ages.  Then I saw that it won't populate the items/money in the trade window.  That takes so much functionality away that it will not catch on.  Addons like this have to be absolutely incredible to work because you have to convince a large portion of the player-base to download them.  People want to run a functional shop.  Purposely gimping it at beautiful non functional GUI will kill adoption.
---
Nah he died lol.
---
I don't like retail.
---
My point is all these zones/raids were added later in the game, if they wernt, it was because it was a stupid idea to begin with.
---
There is no point pidgeonholing them in classic.
---
All you would be doing is putting retail dungeons and raids into classic.
---
You are the true MVP
---
I saw a mage do it today. He got on the zeppelin at Org. Died to NPCs. Rezzed when the zeppelin loaded into STV. I killed him.
---
Can I atleast have troll druids? (A)
---
Acording to r/classicwow mods, yes.
---
Once you go dial up, you never come back.
---
That's great
---
I know that hydra was looking for an add on like this
---
Does it also work with rank 1 etc spells?
---
Fair shout, still cba reading an infornatted essay.
---
"If the healer dies, it's the tanks fault. If the tank dies, it's the healers fault. If the dps die, it's their own fault."
---
Doesn't work in all situations but a general rule of thumb I've always kept.
---
Waiting for send nudes
---
It broke my heart knowing there would never be a 2011scape reboot. That was the true golden era
---
to enjoy open world pvp at max level, not while leveling.
---
That moo is a real emote. He was talking about Pat.
---
Well I’m with you at least, MoP was just fun, felt like the whole expansion was aimed at wow being fun again.
---
"halfway to 60" oh my child, just wait
---
I dont think this is going to happen, but I'd personally like Classic to be the start of a new timeline.
---
What makes Classic so great is the sense of Weight behind literally everything. When you're excited about a 6 slot bag drop and a grey piece of mail, you have something special. 
---
It's hard to build an identity in a game when everything plays the same. In Classic there will be legends. In retail, everyone is the same.
---
In my perfect world, WoW expansions wouldn't have flying, classes would remain unbalanced, leveling up to the new max would take a few months etc etc. 
---
I want my WoW experience to feel like an accomplishment, not a beer drinking, weed smoking Saturday night time killer. 
---
That's what my console games are for.
---
yeah. getting to Goldshire is really hard for horde
---
Something like different set bonuses?
---
Guilds were still clearing MC until the BC prepatch came out.
---
I don't see it... Oh ... Wait.. It's coming!
---
yep, the best thing is, when some player runs away from you and he is just 1 second too far away, you just throw distract behind his back, bam he turns around and runs just in your direction. lol used that so often. the always need some time to comprehend why they are running in my direction instead away.
---
I tank usually but when I dps I definitely notice warriors often pull too slowly. There's an art to pacing and it's important to keep pace since the entire point is to finish instances as quickly as possible to stay productive.
---
its not exactly true that they suck, in some fights they are much better! The stigma comes from the fact that progression wise, you'd have a much easier time with a warrior tank, and there are some bosses that a druid tank just doesn't have the utility for, I mean there are niche ways to get around it, but you'd have to have a specially made group and a tight plan.
---
Questing tonight felt the exact opposite. Ally every I see
---
Is that like a horde boat
---
I'm hoping for a 60 by Christmas lol y'all have so much time on your hands
---
The problem with that (and classic+) is that there isn't a single opinion that's right on what exactly was the mistakes. Sure most people would agree on dungeon finder but there are a lot of more disputed things. I don't see a problem with achievements in theory but some would be dead set against it. Same with flying mounts, portals, etc. All parts made sense at the time they were added and it's hard to point to exactly what parts "broke" the experience and what parts just need a better implementation.
---
As a rogue leveling up with Sub at the moment, I look forward to this
---
I'm only tanking so I can get the fury pieces.
---
Well, simple. Keep classic servers, add new ones for new things, if not, it’s just retail but 15 years later and it’s back to private servers.
---
Warriors have a much greater selection of weapons to equip (all of them) than what any caster can. The warrior, logically, will be much more likely to be able to find another weapon to serve as an upgrade than the caster will over the same period of time. Maybe something the caster can't equip. 
---
So, yes, the classes that have fewer potential upgrades, and can benefit more from the stats on that particular weapon, should get priority. 
---
Or, the warrior takes the caster staff (say a [Dwarven Magestaff](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2072/dwarven-magestaff) of intellect), equips it (binding it to them) and then half way through the dungeon, blue 2h strength non-staff weapon drops that's an even better upgrade (like [Duskbringer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2205/duskbringer). He's the only one who can use it, so he gets it, but now that staff he took earlier is now going to get vendored or DE'd, when it could've been an upgrade to one of the casters in the party.
---
I use an addon called KUI nameplates. Works with classic.
---
I'm playing a mage because I did back in 06, and this sucks tbh. I just want to do a normal instance run, not grind zombies for max xp efficiency
---
I meant that it isn't a real set.
---
He meant the first 60 hours...
---
Wrath was their highest point of active subs, it would make since to get back there at some point. That's what I want.
---
Does this post deserve a nsfw flag?
---
I havent seen a single person asking for content now. The discussion is always post naxx
---
3 up to wotlk then 2 lol
---
No.
---
It is! This is WAR craft, not “leave me alone I’m trying to do quests, don’t give me any trouble please” craft
---
Think it's okey for easy content (such as normals and hc, in retail. Not sure what the equalivent would be in classic) but for stuff like m+ and regular mythics and raid (again for retail, to low lvl to talk about classic) you shouldn't be able to queue to
---
I want TBC so I hope they continue with the expansion. WoW TBC was the best WoW.
---
Just seems like thatd be a straight back to private servers thing to me
---
And there's certainly tanks that overpull, it goes both ways.
---
My point though, if you think the tank is going too slow and start additional pulls as DPS or Healer, you are making the tanks job much harder. It is not easy to pull aggro off someone once it's cemented.
---
There was nothing stupid about an Emerald Dream zone (HUGE part of original Warcraft lore), Azjol-Nerub (so much potential), and the Abyssal Maw raid. I admit that the last one would bother some people since a handful of players have a weird aversion to the underwater play, but I still love the concept. Similar to introducing vehicles in raids, it would just be something new to get used to. BFD and Maraudon have us moving in the water, so I don’t see the issue anyway. 
---
And yeah, the idea is having modern content but in the context of Classic. I don’t think people believe that NORTHREND killed WoW. But a lot of the gameplay and mechanic changes that came along with Northrend’s expansion definitely did. The entire premise of this post is about how to preserve what makes Classic so incredible but also adding onto it.
---
If they do the expacs they'd likely want to charge for them. I dont necessarily begrudge them that as it seems that it took a good amount of work to produce Classic. 
---
The problem I do foresee is that it would begin fragmenting the player base of Classic. You know a group will always clamour for the base classic experience some for the BC only, some for the Wrath.
---
A combination of 1 and 3 could work if they gave everyone a year or so with the drop fed content then it rotated back to classic in a cycle. But then that might put people off knowing their character would eventually not exist.
---
As a paladin, I get it. My buffs only past 5min, I'll get to it when I see the opportunity.
---
I was just there as level 38/39 :) there is like 10 quests there. There is some around the island and also 2 escort quests.
---
Maybe they are just so low level, that they don't show up on the minimap?
---
&gt;arth set to grom gol is s
---
Huh... you are right. How did I not see this in 15 years? XD
---
usually because we've got into trouble so much in the real world and successfully survived 5+ mobs solo with pixels of bar to spare, a dungeon with a pocket healer is a breeze.
---
Yeah they bought curse and integrated the old curse forge into their app
---
Pure Classic. No Classic+. No expansions. No resets.
---
Why is it always the yeti cave? 
---
Just a good ambushing spot? 
---
I’m on Arugal and the ally love the yeti cave here too.
---
You guys are setting yourselves for disappointment.. 
---
You can't compare OSRS with WoW because they are two different games with different reasons why people loved them. 
---
WoW classic is going to die off and won't last a few more months. The game is just nostalgic hype. Doesn't mean it is a bad game, but people are going to move on after getting their nostalgic fix.
---
What i dont understand is why classic content has to be level 60. Why not make expansions with the game philosophy of classic. So we can get to explore something new while it feels relevant. Let's get the intentdd level 65 and so on.
---
What's funny is I assumed something like this would happen (or the site would go down) so I downloaded all his guides beforehand lol.
---
Your name should be scar, that would make this better.
---
Yeah, and that's still a relatively short time frame. 2 years and 3 months.
---
I'm talking about what Classic does 3, 4, 5 years from now. People won't be raiding MC in 2024

Classic expansions sounds like the easiest way but at same time I think it shares community too much. After we have couple of expansions it would limit amount of players in each of them. It would be really hard to maintain healthy server population when people jump from expansion to another.
---
Classic+ is currently my favourite way and seems like a many do like it. People talk a lot about OSRS (Old School Runescape) which has done exactly this approach. They communicate with players and changes are made in a way that players want. I bet this would also be super exiting for both players and developers. We do know there is a lot of ideas that have been tossed away from original Vanilla release. I bet a lot of developers would love to polish those ideas and give them to us, players. Maybe we can visit in Emerald Dream and maybe finally they give us ability to cleanse Ashbringer.
---
Classic+ would naturally have downsides. Basically it requires that new content has meaning. We need reason to do it. I don't think a lot of people would run new raid if it wouldn't give new meaningful gear. That happened back with Naxxramas when people just ignored raid as TBC was going to launch. But if they give us good gear it would make Classic raids obsolete. No reason to visit old raids anymore as there is already more powerful loot.
---
With variation for true Classic I like thought about seasonal playing. I think idea they do with Diablo is pretty nice and private server Ascension had form of this idea as well. After game is completely played through after last phase, they could bring us seasons. Every season has some kind of unique aspect like double xp, TBC talents, no mana cost etc. With this season we could play Classic in different ways. After season ends, then you can transfer your max level character to normal game which is always preserved as it was.
---
This is super hard thing. There is so much options but naturally they can't do everything. With more and more time I just want to see Classic+ to happen as OSRS did prove it as working concept. I am super exited to hear what they are going to do after last phase.
---
As a hunter I can do all that without consequences, because most of the time the mage in the group aggroed all the mobs anyway. 😅
---
Agility will give more crit like you said, which in turn will generate more frequent crits. I believe auto attack crits generate 2x the rage vs a noncrit auto. You'll see warriors opt for more agility often.

Thats how it works. Spell dmg is the best stat for raiding but for aoe grind you go more int/stam
---
CLASSIC.
---
ITS CALLED CLASSIC WOW.
---
YOU DONT CHANGE CLASSICS.
---
What part of classic do you morons not understand.
---
There is enough content to last your average player 3-5 years, after that, couldn't care less if people get bored and leave.
---
There will always be players willing to play classic.
---
Quicker kills tho and if one person is done their drop opens to all after they loot. Not grouping is still gimping yourself
---
Yes, it's a very easy way to get instantly rich. With your luck you are basically losing by not participating.
---
Honestly, I don't care
---
Raiding is gay, seriously takes way too long. I'm here for the pvp, and for the time being leveling and dungeons have been fun

Something like that, yes. "Increase threat generation while in bear form" or "Pet damage increased by X"

---
What he said is dripping in elitist gatekeeping, but the spirit of what he is trying to say is kinda true. Its just too early to speculate until its at that point. 
---
If it turns out that naxx is cleared by a drastically larger percentage of the playerbase than it was in vanilla, they might entertain ideas about more content. BUT if the same/close to small % of players clear it, then they're gonna be less likely to invest in making more content.
---
But it it's the only backup it's the oldest backup so he was technically right
---
How would you feel about adding Post-Vanilla skills into the game via some form of... glyph or something?
---
Why drop wrath though? That would be completely changing their story set up in WC3. The whole goal was killing the linch king. Cata is where it went wrong for me.
---
Out of curiosity, why not in lava?
---
You're not entirely wrong because people worrying about *the future* even before the release, instead of just focusing in the present, is a bit mind boggling. Said this, horrible presentation of the topic by your side.

---
Why do we consider tbc and wotlk "classic expansions"?
---
So fucking hilarious. I could watch this all day.
---
Something similar happened to me like 2 days ago. As a night elf druid I was minding my own business killing raptors, when out of nowhere a warrior and a shaman jumped on my ass. I ran away since they were around 40~ while I was 35~, on my way to Nessingwary's camp a bunch of other horde players jumped on the opportunity of my half health ass and also started following me.
---
So I had around 5 to 10 players following my ass into the camp, which thankfully for me was for some reason filled with alliance which instantly jumped to my aid and started a war that probably lasted like an hour.
---
I couldn't help but laugh at that little lvl 30 horde mage that started yelling "no killing" after dying non stop for like 30 minutes, even though he was one of the opportunists that tried to chase my ass.
---
Sadly it was broken up when the horde got tired of dying and called lvl 60s players to their aid which just made us scatter.
---

---
Classic Expansions. I think everyone has wanted to go back in time and change decisions they've made at some point and well, this is Blizzards time to do exactly that.
---
What if right after lich king they make a new expansion and go a different way from cataclysm and all the other expansions
---
I like the first option, but I would hope they handle it similar to diablo seasons. They reset the server, and your characters are still playable, but are in a non-season status and you can only play with other non-season characters and remain in phase 6. Or you can start a fresh, season character and you only play with other season characters and the phase progression starts back at phase 1. The seasons would have to be year long compared to the couple months long season diablo has, but I think it is the best option to keep Classic original.
---
You're on horde, but that translation is for alliance to horde.
---
Seems like it would be enough to quench everyone's thirst if they just ran things up to Wrath. Wouldn't it be a pain in the ass for them to redo everything to fit into classic standards?
---
As someone playing a Paladin who both tanks and heals levelling dungeons, I love having a Warlock in my group. The ability to instantly summon in a replacement if someone’s acting like an idiot is an amazing extra layer of protection.
---
is this really what you want everyone reading this thread to see?
---
  KUI nameplates since today shows itself at 10 yards distance and there is no way to change it. So if target  farther, you still can't read name.
---
Ahh a men of culture, can i have some of that cracktorio?
---
Am I the only one who doesn't trust Blizzard to not fuck up a "Classic+"? 
---
How depressing would it be if the game we loved then got turned to crap and then we've lost it again. We'd have to go back to private servers.
---
Would much prefer a reset of servers or expansions up to Wrath.
---
It absolutely trivialized questing and travel, and weakens the wPvP scene. The epic flying mount moves insanely fast compared to ground mounts and allows you to zip between targeted quest objectives and nodes without having to actually play the game. Part of the allure of Classic is this challenge where you have to be careful in your paths. Imagine if you could just fly to the top of Jintha’alor instead of doing the minidungeon.
---
Developer here, can approve. Never played this game before but its just amazing how good it is.
---
Is it wrong to ask for all 3?
---
That assumes they have competent developers left. Which they obviously dont. Clearly they went in a specific direction with retail due to poor decisions by those in charge.
---
I love how magecleave groups are runnign rampant but blizz thought "nah, warrior tanks are too OP".
---
Fuck it really is vanilla again
---
While starshards isn’t completly useless, it is generally not a good spell. You will use it while farming and leveling. 
---
Shadowmeld is on the other hand very good on a PvP server.
---
Mapping out your own route requires a decent amount of play time and experience. You can't act like a 60 hr lvl 40 is that reasonable for an average player, regardless of "focus"
---
Did you /who for tanks in your level range and whisper them directly?  This is the old school method to get a group together.
---
Love that maniacal laugh.
---
Uden lo
---
A message to fury warriors:
---
You're a warrior, not a fury warrior, go tank if you want to join groups, you will get a group faster and you will have less competition for your gear, it's a win/win for you.
---
DICK!
---
Classic+. Its inevitable that they will release new content if the game is successful. But if they can't just cater to hardcore raiders. They can't just make another harder 40 man. They have to make new ways for players who either can't or don't want to commit to serious raiding to spend their time. This is the same fundamental dilemma they encountered before and they did a few good things that they should do again. 
---
They should make new 10 mans and reintroduce Kharazan. They should also make heroic versions of the existing five mans. And they should introduce the arena. 
---
At the same time, they should very slightly tweak classes and balance only to clean up half-finished ideas and obvious oversights and correct some of the most fun-destroying aspects of the game. I'm not talking about nerfing travel time or making it easier to level. I just think they should make it so no one spec is truly useless. Let people dps as a moonkin without making it so mages are simply more effective and more engaging. Fix it so multiple shadowpriests can actually function together in a raid, so players can finally take full advantage of concepts they fell in love with.
---
They should keep making new large and difficult raids too. Its part of the soul of the game. They just need other paths too. This time they have a huge opportunity to steer it better with a narrower audience that they know.
---
Not where I was. There was no one else around. They said they had increased the respawn rates on top of what it already was.
---
“Didn’t see your HP dropping in my party frames”
---
Hey fuck you dude, it's practical
---
I'm on Stalagg and I truly see quite a balance between factions, at least in the locations I'm questing rn. Maybe layering?
---
Drops by worldboss dragon, dno if they in phase 1
---
That's at best a bandaid, Outlands was inherently designed for max level players to have flyers. There are probably 5-10 spots designed for max level players to reach with flyers in every zone, you can't add FP's to all of those.
---
The best solution IMO is for Blizz to take assets and direction from Cata's leveling zones and use that to fill in the map with areas designed with classic in mind.
---
E.G. Mt. Hyjal with an Emerald Dream raid, Uldum with an air themed version of MC, retuned/changed Karazhan, a replaced twilight highlands, etc.
---
That gives classic at least an expansion's worth of content without requiring they break the world into more chunks.
---
Which really sounds fantastic to me. I don't want to spend a week or two grinding out levels through filler zones, I'd much rather be able to start raids/attunement immediately. Imagine a world where instead of a new expansion every few years we just got a new zone and raid, maybe a dungeon or two, every 6-12 months. Each one could introduce a few skills and talent points (exactly like how GW2 does their xpacs).
---
That's my dream. Give me a new rep grind, a way to earn enough talent points for a new tier of talents and abilities, and a satisfying raid on a relatively brisk schedule. That and round out the specs so they're all viable (and let enh shamans tank!). They do that and I think the classic playerbase would be overwhelmingly happy.
---
Classic+ and I quit my job!
---
If they keep adding content the big question is do they re-balance things + add spells? I know it t may be unpopular but i think absolutely not
---

Classic+ would be better than nothing, but my dream would be a brand new WoW 2 based on old-school design principles.
---
Your Mac prob just need a cleanup! :) 
---
Dust/hair/gunk gets in the fans/radiators. Not unusual for a laptop that's 4 years old. 
---
Just open the bottom and blow it with compressed air,  remember to hold on to the fan( so it does not go mad crazy spin and break). 
---
Maybe even take the fans out, I haven't don't it with the 2015. Buy ive done quite a few times on the 15" 2011 with great success.
---
Less fan noise, lower temps, better performance :) 
---
Some people also replace the thermal paste, I would recommend that you read up on that before doing it. Just so you know the risk and potential gain by it 😀
---
Either way could be interesting to an extent I think classic will get to a no more content point in that it would need to see some sort of growth or Branch out.
---
What’s confusing about it?
---
Classic+ gets my vote
---
Anyone remember Everquest 2? Yeah..
---
Progression Server - after xx weeks of each game state, content unlocks vertically until the server reaches retail.
---
Locked Server - after xx weeks of each game state, content unlocks vertically until xx.yy patch, where it remains forever.
---
I honestly think they might do a good job, all the retail QoL things and microtransactions would prob stay in retail, giving blizz a larger target audience with classic+ being the more rpg focused, slow paced game while retail will stick to the more "modern" game design of fast gameplay with lots of QoL and that stuff thats in everygame atm. This would yield them 2 flows of revenue since it would appeal to 2 diffrent crowds
---
I tried a 39 Ret Paladin in Classic..... It was the most fun I've had in BG's.
---
Will be making one again once I get bored on my main.
---
That's fine, with better design those issues could be fixed so there at least competitive. My point was that the class design was better and wasn't like retail now where everyone basically does the same damage. The class flavors was still there
---
I mean you don’t have to do that. You can just grind mobs. You can grind professions. You can quest a bit grind a bit do a dungeon here or there. There is no need to do what the majority of players are doing. But questing, leveling, and dungeon running is the very heart of an MMO so if that is unappealing I think the genre itself isn’t a good fit.
---
Used for flask of the titans. Don't know which version of the recipe they're using, but they took 30 of them per flask in vanilla.
---
For the record, those are unit frames, not nameplates. Correcting so you don't get confused if you go looking for addons.
---
One of the big issues with expansions are that they diluted the population to the point if making everywhere empty. Classic+ could work by letting the existing world continuously evolve instead of just adding more and more new areas.
---
True Classic without a doubt. I don't want them having to maintain what is effectively another game for every expansion, and I definitely don't want new content. If we want to have WoW 2, then just make WoW 2, don't twist Classic into it.
---
Would it be good if they balance class aswell? Make pala tank vaaible, add tier tokens, make it little bit like TBC.
---
I happened to find the original version of Runescape when I was a kid not too long after it’s release. When the entire game was free, I had a fairly high level character before they introduced members.
---
OSRS has its merits even if it’s outdated. I had a blast with the original runescape launch, I don’t think OSRS would have been anywhere near as successful if they made it more like the earliest versions than the 07 version.
---
If you wait in the throne room you hear the entire cinematic.
---
I meant that it doesn't matter from cosmetic standpoint. Visuals DOES matter in situations when you need to quickly evaluate someone gear and make a decision, for example in PvP if you are undergeared, you'll look for someone that doesn't have certain pieces of gear or at least they look like they don't have it (for example, if you see warrior with Lionheart helm and Arcanite Reaper, you should probably avoid them or pick a 2v1 fight). So from a minmaxing standpoint it is better to not have transmog in PvP since you can somewhat clearly see your enemy's power level. Transmog can both hide your undergear-ness or bamboozle others if you have simple and not flashy transmog. I do like cosmetics, but we are playing World of WARcraft, not Barbie Magical Dress-Up.
---
I'm of the strong opinion that 101 101 -&gt; zug zug shouldn't count as its literally just a horde noise.
---
If it's a fair 1v1 I don't bother, in fact I prefer it when people don't help me when I get those because it's more fun that way. If they are being ganked while fighting mobs, or there's a 3+ level difference I will jump no questions asked.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing a group finder that worked as like bulletin board inside the major cities - similar to the AH.  You could basically post listings for your group and look for other people's groups but still had to travel to the zones, etc.
---
So what? And Warriors are the best single target and tank in the game should we all reroll war? Just play what you want
---
-True classic is stupid. Nobody is going to want to lose their hundreds of hours of progress just to do same thing over and over again. If somebody wants start over they can just create a new character.
---
-Classic expansions would divide the playerbase.
---
So the only good option imo is classic+
---
I’ve been daydreaming of Kara ever since I started playing. Best dungeon
---
Makes sense, Chen Stormstout was in W3 after all, where he had abilities Monks would later gain.
---
Why not Classic+ and Classic Expansions?  Heck the first all three options would be doable if you go for those two.
---
Definitely try to get Wand upgrades asap. There's a good list here: [Vanilla Wands Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTm4F0MKf-HFEhHV7RjCS-MmQOFKinmXLNKMVC1N1RILG80RwtSQmAewGs0glOt2GMle9hRdbdTrUG2/pubhtml#) (Don't know who made it, wasn't me)
---
My gear is pretty bad mostly, but that's ok. Just the wand needs to rock! ;)
---
Happy grinding to you too!
---
You've probably already heard of it, but Satisfactory is a really well done 3d take on the factory building genre. It's very different than factorio and simplified somewhat but it's hella fun and the world is hand crafted so exploring is a blast. Also, the devs have a really good track record, they did the Sanctum games as well as Goat Simulator (for what that's worth).
---
If someone is acting like that, you can safely assume they're not worth listening to.
---
 Then he steals a mob of you so you use recklessness on the mob a
---
Ya we should create a new faction besides horde/alliance and put those ppl in there and both gank them
---
Goon squad is trash
---
seems like a simple enough solution to me until a proper fix could be worked out, Blizzard hire this man
---
You are misunderstanding my point. It's legacy servers, to let you play the old content. While I completely agree that the beauty of Classic is the design philosophy that the devs abandoned over 10 years ago. the concept of releasing legacy servers is not linked to crafting new content in the same style, atleast from a business perspective. It does, however, open the doors for this as a possibility, but it's not a part of the legacy server offer that is Wow Classic.
---
Can we get a straw poll, please?
---
You really are
---
PvE PvE. Servers where that can’t happen exist
---
I'm playing in the EU with 120ms ping and have zero issues.
---
A tab target MMO from 2004 is not highly ping dependent.
---
As long as I kan keep my lvl 60 and continue doing world pvp in a balanced facion I'm happy with what ever they do. If so I'd be excited for both the regular expansion with a character copy service, even for a fee, or classic+.
---
I'm horde. But this list still seems to make sense. :)
---
I find it laughable how people can't understand what makes classic wow good. Put hard work in and reap the big rewards JUST LIKE IN LIFE.
---
Neither does he
---
I mc people more times than not to kill them, just part of being on a PvP server. And I've mc'd many a people off of boats juuuust before it teleports you to the other dick you were heading to.
---
Is this why Halo MCC on PC is taking forever :(
---
I just want Karazhan to exist in this classic plus and paladins able to tank 👌
---
Babyyyyy
---
I can't wait until we reach classic BFA and start the cycle again on classic classic.
---
Classic+ all the way
---
They could also do the original Emerald Dream full zone planned, as well as under Northrend (there was a kingdom under Northrend planned), the realm of the High Elves, Tel'abim, Plunder Isle, Island of Doctor Lapidis / Gillijim's Isle, Undermine, etc.
---
Just keep doing whatever you want. 
---
Skinning and leatherwork are good for a hunter because you can wear what you make. You can also just go skinning and herbalism if you want money and don't care about anything else. 
---
Ask around in general chat for any guilds. They have to send you an invite. There's also a guild recruitment channel you can join in chat but I forget what it's called exactly, you can just ask in general chat to find out whatever that channel is called.
---
If you're in a heavy PvP zone pop a trap and flare before you engage mobs and stay around them. Should deter most rogues.
---
If they cheap shot at that level and get a crippling poison proc it will be tough to live.
---
Oh of course. As much as I loved classic, RS2 is the more popular version. Jagex even shut down their last classic servers a year or two ago.
---
None of the above.
---
I'd rather take each feature and vote them in, per server.
---
The new classes would be cool... everything before Pandas, really. But then leave out all the controversial stuff.
---
^^ if it can play retail at any rate, it can play classic 5x better.
---
/raises hand. Guilty!
---
Dont mean to sound like a dick but do you not have times where you pay attention to your hitpoints/mana after fighting a few mobs that you can just quickly have a glance at the smiley face square to see if its happy or not? You wanna keep it green all the time not just so it dosnt run away but so it does a lot more damage aswell
---
My voidwalker once said "I am void... where prohibited"  I have ever only heard that once, years ago. Am I insane? (Or maybe just sleep deprived?)
---
I think option 3 would be best mainly due to it giving the private server players what they want and also doesnt confuse the lore nerds (like me) anymore then they already do with retcon. I think classic+ would cause the issue of the timeline fragmentation that WoD caused. And again, as a lore nerd that would annoy me. Also would probably split the resources at blizzard to much to run 2 different warcraft MMOs simultaneously, when they can just release TBC and WotLK like they did with classic and just copy/page your classic progresses to those without wiping your classic characters, then whatever you feel like playing you swap to on bnet launcher, like you do now with classic and retail.
---
Yea dungeon finder should be striped of all these things:  
---
Automatic teleportation  
---
Strip gear score information etc  
---
Do not allow to select classes but only roles.
---
Its because you sound like a massive prick
---
This is quite the sight to see, truly.
---
Cross realm BGs would have been awfully nice when I was playing back in the day. Horde destroyed my server
---
There's a difference between having an opinion and talking down someone's work of art.
---
You didn't have to comment something you know is negative that isn't affecting you directly at all.
---
Oh look that person's glasses are ugly.

I want express myself and tell him it's lame!
---
Yay free speech.
---
*Activision enters the room*
---
Funny thing. two days ago i put like 8 items on the AH. 3 grey mail shoulders and 5 green pants with str+stam.  Gues what sold.... :P
---
Classic expansion! At least burning crusade.
---
Classic with resets every quarter so it's a race to down KT, in similar fashion to D3 seasons OR Classic+.
---
i would love to get BC and WOTLK.
---
What's the niche of ret paladin in Vanilla? You can bring a holy paladin instead for the buffs and actual good healing and let another class take the dps spot more effectively.
---
Most specs have a niche but some are really prescindible and meme tier.
---
Yes we do!
---
that doesn't stop thing like scorch or any spell you can cast moving.
---
Rogue quest line!
---
Wish me 1:1 WotLk 🥺
---
Basically like the group finder on retail (not the dungeon finder)? If you want to do a mythic or mythic+ dungeon, you have to form a group yourself and are not teleported.
---
If they go TBC then all of this was for nothing
---
TBC is my jam yo. Maybe because I'm biased because as ret pala, TBC is when I also became relevant for both non-meme dps and actually tanking instead of flash of light spambot.
---
I loved Outland and flying around the world and the events of the lore felt actually meaningful instead of a neverending story. If Blizz goes for the 3rd option, I'll gladly stick around till even the end of WotLK. Cata is definitely where I draw the line though.
---
Not a game developer but yes 😀
---
Unique classic+ content. Or else Classic i dead within 6 months.
---
Well it keeps people engaged even if it's not good.
---
My best buddy is a warrior. I've decided to make my druid a healer spec as a result
---
Why not merge classic and retail and make "classic expansions" available through a more thorough built time walking system?
---
So you have a character at 120, time walk it to lvl 60. Your BIS gear at 120 suddenly isn't BIS anymore and all effects doesn't work so you have to grind gear. 
---
Once time walking to a new expansion you'd also have to do the grind for your character to hit the level cap of that expansion.
---
A huge cool feature could also be to have the option to reset your current time walking so you could relive the expansion.
---
You'd keep gear, bags, professions, gold infliction would probably be a head scratcher but I'm just spitballin here 😁
---
nah
---
I'd like a combination of two and three. 
---
Once all the vanilla content is out, and we're all playing it, make new servers with free character migration (maybe even character copies), which move on to tbc. At the end of that, split once more. 
---
Yes, this might split the community. I doubt this is an issue though, based on the simple fact that private servers exist for pretty much all expansions; there are plenty of people whose favourite version is vanilla, and plenty who loves BC, and plenty would like nothing more than spend all their time in Lich king. 
---
Who knows, some people might even like cataclysm. 
---
I think the option for progression through the expansion should be an option, but after each step, there should be an option to stick around on the previous expansion. With new content would be cool, but that might be too much to ask now that I think of it.
---
2007scape has the same issue tbh. Devs add new content and the players want the loot to be upgrades and worth their time, but because health caps at 99 even a piece of gear that adds 1 to your max hit will make a pretty noticeable difference. Power creep is a huge issue and most new items are either very small upgrades, or items with a niche use for specific situations or types of enemies. Could definitely be an option for WoW instead of every spec having a single BIS set.
---
Tough one. Classic Expansions or a Classic+ which is just a more balanced Classic e.g. fixing broken specs, making raids a bit more difficult etc.

How many hunters are in your group?
---
go into both the windows and wow sound settings and make sure you're set to stereo speakers and not surround.
---
Yeah, like, it's literally no harder than checking if you're nearly dead, or if it's nearly dead, or if you switched off Aspect of the Cheetah or not. :P
---
Hahaha, this one is probably a little more rage inducing than mine. Well done brother!
---
I might actually play if Classic+ is confirmed
---
True classic without reset for me.
---
Even though I think Classic+ would be the funniest option I just don't have faith in blizzard to make it. Where as they have already proved they can remake as long as they know we want no changes. So even though I want classic+ the most my vote would ultimately go towards moving to tbc and beyond.
---
Do you not notice the little frowning face by its portrait?
---
My favorite color is orange, and I'm a combat rogue &lt;3
---
Fairbanks, the name sake of the OG classic realm
---
44 for it to be comfortable according to my tank friend.
---
A lot of people use asmon stream to run their own youtube shit, but every now and again Asmon has something important to say.  I don't think he should be banned from posting.
---
I do this but I dot their mobs instead to give them that little boost.
---
Ok
---
Carefully designed Tier 4 sets (tokens?) that allow for spec diversity.
---
New raid that would require T2.5 or better gear to even do, it would be a gear check.
---
Rated BGs for PVP too
---
Pretbc.com was like that a long time ago. 2.4.3 in vanilla environment. It was the best privateserver i ever played on.
---
Personally I would love a tbc and wrath servers and then it stops there.  No one in their right mind wants to go back to the likes of cata, WoD or BFA.
---
there's an Off-Meta discord that explore this stuff https://discord.gg/CJxxfcR
---
Would love both a classic+ option and to have servers for vanilla BC and WotLK
---
Aaaahhh, thank you!
---
"Incident"
---
I think it was fully intentional..
---
I’ll try it out and report back ;)  
---
I’d like to have an easy way of keeping track of who spawn camps me/my guildies, heh.
---
Definitely Classic +. Would much rather see new content that sticks with all the principles and elements that make classic as amazing as it is.
---
WTF does miss even mean? Like dodge means that the enemy jumped outta the way or something, but miss just means what? I swung at the wrong thing or in the wrong direction?
---
Sure but the inverse is true. 
---
At level 60 that same 50 strength is a drop of attack power in your pool, while 50 agility is still worthwhile. 
---
It's a question of linear vs exponential. 
---
Strength is linear so with low numbers, it increases at a decent rate while with higher numbers agility increases faster.
---
Haha.. Same. I've had to clean up the quest log a couple of times. I spent the last few hours turning in quests.. I think im down to 10 now..
---
I see. I just notice a delay in my cheap shot ability upon using it on a target on my current server, compared to a west coast server that I tested. I just feel like I'm not playing on the optimal choice of what's available to me, basically.
---
NGL, I had envisioned a PVP battle compared to a RPPVP battle would have been much like the difference between a battle and a rap battle.
---
Classic+ easily, I have no desire to do all the same content, if I want TBC I can just play on a private server, only reason I play classic here and not on some private server is the hope that it will branch out into something unique instead of repeating old mistakes.
---
&gt;So initially they don't even know that deadzone is a concept at all.
---
Yeah, they blink in close to a hunter because they dont wanna get shot. they frost nova and realize "hey this guy isn't swinging his sword at me? Wtf" they ask one person wtf happened in general chat and they learn. Besides, simply knowing about a dead zone doesnt make them good at exploiting it either. What your saying is like telling an art student what "wet blending" is and handing him paint. Simply having knowledge does jack shit with out practice. Pvp is all repetition. 
---
Anyway, I could go on about your misguided ideas on how you think gamers should just cookie cut their way through games, doing what all the streamers and guides tell them to do, not discovering things on their own. I would rather sleep.
---
Get questie, a junk autoseller, and a bag merger addon. Profession wise just pick up skinning and skin what you kill for extra cash (vendor the hides if you can't AH them for more money).
---
Everything else isn't mandatory to know imo you'll pick a lot of it up on the way.
---
Thats me dude :D I collect like 10000VIp points.. Never gonna use them probably.
---
Dumb question: as a warlock (gnome), how do I get summon voidwalker? Is it from a trainer quest, and if so, which trainer? I'm level 10 and didn't get anything from the ironforge trainer.
---
I remember meeting online friends in front of ironforge every day after school. Some days we did nothing but chatting and keep duelling us.
---
Played frostmage back then, had so much fun there.
---
My parents did not understand tho
---
While I agree, I feel like that wasn't unique to BC.  
---
It was more instanced off, but how often did you visit Dun Morough or run Mara at 60?  
---
Maybe farming for something specific, but it's part of the way the game is that some areas you just outgrow unless you want to be there.
---
Problem is that D3 is a get-in-get-out. Getting a character built and geared decently is a matter of days, and there's no in-game economy to speak of.
---
WoW's community and economy takes months, if not years to rebuild. I can't speak for everyone but for me, Classic feels like a second chance to properly experience content I missed out on or couldn't take advantage of. 15 years of WoW and various other MMOs makes me see Classic with new, wisened eyes and renewed appreciation.
---
I don't want that to be stepped on and scrapped regularly. I'm grateful for the chance to experience Vanilla again but I'll be pissed if get regularly brought back to the starting line.
---
I want them to take everything they've learned and make a new mmo from scratch with brand new lore.
---
Let’s think about this, if this happened the classic community would be divided between 4 or 5 different servers, there would be barely anyone online on any given server, this isn’t a good idea.
---
Do you think they could do a bit of both? Classic+ with addition content and the periodic switch of servers (or new servers) for each expansion?
---
In my server someone added a password to lfg
---
I'm hoping I'll hit 60 in relatively short order, I'm playing a shaman for the first time, and leveling feels remarkably slow. But I've never enjoyed leveling anything, so that's fine.
---
My long term goal with vanilla is to find a nice group to raid relatively seriously with (as in we're roughly the same group every time, minimal picking up randoms), and eventually I really want the sulfuras hammer.
---
Oh man the keyboard turn. That's when you know dun goofed.
---
Rogue here. Why isn’t Remorseless Attacks not a popular talent for leveling? I love this talent but it’s usually not in rogue leveling talent guides.
---
god, I love classic memes. 
---
well done.
---
Honestly, I want all three. Give me all three, please. I want the 40-man vanilla Kara they never did, player housing behind that instance gate in Stormwind, all the things we never got to see, while keeping the complexity of the game, it's original design, alive.
---
Hi there steak.
---
I like steak.
---
No it wasnt
---
Mirah's song is a pretty good off hand upgrade. Quest in Scholomance if I'm not mistaken,
---
That combined with many dungeons in Classic requiring you to run through a pre-dungeon (DM, WC, Mara, RFD, BRD, ST) makes the summoning stone a not-too-OP tool, imo. And this does not negate the handy tool of a lock summoning inside when needed. Still makes it a hassle to get a replacement, even if you include a TBC style group finder. And I do feel sorry for locks always having to do the leg work.
---
This is literally Classic+
---
I need BC so the classes I play now are viable
---
I would like a enhanced crafting system were different mats could be changed out to give new and interesting results. Were cooperation between different crafting is required and items that feels unique too my character. Instead of just going for the tier items and looking like every one else.
---
Also I would really like if spell rank gave different visual effects. Top ranked fireball with critical effect should rip the world apart.
---
City bosses like thrall should have a chance of dropping interesting loot.
---
World events like in guild wars.
---
Add more life to NPCs and make things less static.
---
Reputation should have bigger effects.
---
I want classic+
---
Honestly those guys being so pissed just kind of sounds like a bonus prize for completing the quest.
---
True classic already is deviated from retail wow.
---
oh wow, this is wild, nice find.
---
It's gonna be a shitstorm Randy!
---
Vanilla was so great when you broke the mold though. If people weren't so impatient. Prot paladins don't work the same way warriors do, not that anyone waits for sunders anyway
---
I still prefer dungeon finder anyway.
---
basically make a macro for every ability that also includes the line /startattack
---
right clicking on an enemy to start attacking it can make you loot the dead mob behind it, stopping your autoattacks.
---
You certainly got me! I was minding my own business questing, and some shaman attacked me for no reason. I luckily found him later and doted his ass as he was mining. He then ran off like a coward! 
---
Karma?
---
I'm still playing. Will leave sub up for a month or two. I can see the drop off coming though, in the distance.
---
Nothing's really "missing" per se, I knew what I signed up for. Game is good, game is fun. Game is **familiar**. That's the real issue, at the end of the day. Same old song, same old dance. I've been playing WoW off and on for 15 years. There are no more surprises here. It's a comfortable old routine I can dip into now and again when there is a dry run of new titles in the genres I enjoy, but sooner or later a game is going to catch my eye, and I'll pop out of WoW to play it, and I'll have so much more fun, comparatively, then whatever low-return-on-investment chore list nonsense end game always devolves into. And that'll be that.
---
But until then, I'll keep pluggin' away. Game is good. Game is fun.
---
And here I am constantly wishing the quest log would hold like 150+ Quests...
---
"As it turns out, the only person with the skillset to fix these specific train signal bugs is also deep into levelling his Priest"
---
single person dependencies...
---
Well, they gambled - and lost.
---
Dragon isles, etc would be dope too
---
Wait till he figures out how to bind other keys.
---
40 levels, actually. Also 4 friends on the server, but we're in the boat together. It could just be the way vanilla feels in comparison to retail, but otherwise I'm definitely noticing the delay. Whether that's lag, or just the game.
---
I agree on this. Classic+ with the TBC "fixes"
---
I got saved earlier today in Arathi by two fellow hordies. Got jumped by a warrior at the farm filled with syndicate while fighting a mob. I charmed him with my Succubus, then feared / dotted him, trying to divide my attention between him and the mobb still attacking me. He came back, killed my demon so I ran, figured I probably wouldn't make it. Suddenly two other hordes come rampaging out of the farm and run down the warrior, who was already attempting to flee when he realised he was outnumbered.
---
My heroes.
---
Stalagg horde unite !
---
Is engineering switch in yet?
---
I remember this coming later but unsure when. Someone was saying its available now but not sure if they were trolling. Any ideas anyone?
---
This tiger is crap, seriously. One of worse pets
---
If you have healing spells then you can heal.
---
What’re u doing with two frost bolts on your bar?
---
classic+.
---
As a ali noob warlock, cant i just kite you out of the range of this totem? or is it spammable?
---
A perfect description of retail vs classic characters is. In retail you play a feral druid. In classic you play a druid with a slight preference for agi gear
---
Ok that makes sense I didnt know much about it and I saw where I can learn first aid and but didnt want to mess anything up!
---
What are the addons you're using? I am playing warlock for the first time and finding it hard to find solid addons to use. I like the way your UI looks and I'd like to replicate it.
---
You are 38 with 63 Gold.
---
If you just Keep going with questing. You should be able to accumulate enough Gold to get the Mount by 40.
---
What I found is that normal questing give way more Gold than actually grinding :p You kill the Mobs anyway but also get quest rewards pretty much.
---
I wasted 2 days farming tigers and Gorillas and got like 16g from it.
---
Yesterday I quested from 37 to 37 1/2 and got 14gold.
---
(The 2 days farming were literally 2 Levels grinding) so it was 16g from 2 Levels vs 14gold from 1/2 Level. 
---
I gotta say I had some quests piled up though from having grinded 2 Levels beforehand... :3
---
Classic is technically retail too
---
Tbh, even with MS, warrior will never feel really strong. I feel it's powers are greatly exaggerated. Alone it just isn't very strong and in pvp, unless you really get the drop on someone, you are in for a hard time.   
---
But the skills are fun, and they feel connected.  Warrior too, but i allready know i will also be leveling a hunter, a shaman and a priest in due time, and all of them will be an easier experience then the warrior.  Note that i say easier and not more fun.    
---
The key with a warrior is to accept it's weaknesses, and play it for what it is, and be wanted as a tank, but nearly any other class will have an easier time in both PvE as well as PvP when not backed up.
---
This is more skinning dependant and makes this area more reliable for gold per hour - grind as many STV Basilisks and tigers as you can, there’s a great area to the south east of Grom’Gol &amp; just over the river where I solidly did a few levels and it allowed me to comfortably get my mount prior to 40. The loot tables of both mob types are pretty lucrative imo.
---
Or kids who grew up without a pc that could handle wow... I played runescape my whole life 2004-present and I didn't pay for membership til like 2009 lol
---
Yes
---
This was posted here some time before launch as well and I have it printed as reference. Just add a level or two to the minimum for each zone and you'll have a better experience.
---
yea, it's an awesome read
---
There’s quite a few quests there that you have to just stumble upon. If you go down the main road leading out of theramore you’ll come across a few or just check a map for them on google
---
Sure does, so dont do it in a populated area or with strangers
---
Warlocks: The only class with truly green technology. Recycling shitty gnome souls into nutritious health bars.
---
Just a bunch of rogues?
---
Doing....rogue stuff?
---
I'd rather switch otherwise the thought in your subconsciousness will be always present that you'd rather play as Alliance. I wouldn't feel good leveling something to 60 I am not comfortable with 100%.
---
None of the major streamers invented dungeoncleave.
---
It was (along with farming outdoor Elite areas in a guild premade) the best way to level in Vanilla. It wasn't as refined as it is now (thanks for that btw, private server community) but it absolutely existed back then too.
---
If you do not like dungeon-cleave, make your own groups. It is literally that simple. Spend less time QQing on reddit and more time whispering tanks and healers asking if anyone is interested in just doing a normal Sunken Temple FC. Add the people you enjoy grouping with to your friends list and play with them.
---
That's gonna require you do something but cry online though so I gues it's a longshot.
---
Have fun fam.
---
What is it with this sub and looking for dick like objects? Are you all in the closet or what's wrong?
---
What if they all did and yet nobody has found it yet
---
Fingers crossed :)
---
You have to farm elite dragon mobs or azurehod when he releases or pay a lot of gold for the quiver. So it's rare that people bother getting it.
---
LFG/ LFR killed wow, as well as flying mounts. it went from actually adventuring across the lands and interacting with people (the whole point of an MMO) to sitting in Org/SW and hitting a button to raid with randos that never talked until you reach max level so you can hit the same buttons in LFR and not talk with people. 
---
If they truly expand on Wow classic, it'll be a freaking gold mine for them. if they do anything else, people will unsub because whats the point of cleaing naxx full on knowing nothing happens after
---
Wow. Trash like that needs to be reported.
---
Twitch owns Curse.
---
Curse used to be the place to go and get mods and add-ons for games. It still is. 
---
Now Twitch does that.
---
Locks can’t do that but priests can MC off cliffs.
---
It's in, and has been from the start.
---
I know this comparison has been made before but OSRS is the perfect example of how Classic should progress imo. They reverted back to the "best" version of RS to start from and continued to develop the game separate from the RS main game whilst keeping within that OSRS feel. Classic+ would over take the main WoW game just like OSRS has for RS.
---
What was the original distance in Vanilla? Because I have no idea.
---
A thing on that island keep in SW with guards.
---
Nope, please nope.
---
Always looking the same unless you get nee gear is a big part of classic for me.
---
Are you me?
---
&lt;Ding Dong Daddies&gt;
---
Classic+ all the way!
---
So what you're saying is.. "You think you want it, but you really dont"?
---
It takes some high-level potions and a lot of time sunk into the grind, but it's a really rewarding way to play.
---
Not sure how many devs want to work on making Classic+ though. The tech and tools must be old as shit and a pain to work with compared to what they have in retail.
---
Depends. Normally a tip if anything is enough if I'm offering something for free. If it's a portal on my mage, I do expect at least the reagent cost. Most people at my level will tip me 30-50 silver for a portal though. Usually if we're in say an instance or something that's pretty far from anything, I get tipped more.
---
&gt; objective manner
---
You either don't understand what 'objective' means or you're being wilfully ignorant. Nothing you said was objective.
---
You described your own personal reasons for liking Cata - those reasons do not necessarily extend to other people. 
---
Cata was generally badly received. It remains towards the bottom half of most peoples lists.
---
Classic+ 110%
---
Outplayed.
---
Spam wingclip as hunter, FD, drink, spam again.
---
I would want classic+ I think OSRS has done a great job. (I don't play, just from what I've heard)
---
Can't see it happening though, I assume blizzard already has the assets from previous expansions. So they could just bring out new servers for those expansions with minimal investment. Hopefully I'm wrong!
---
Yeah classic is fantastic now as most people are leveling, come Naxx we will get a lot of people reliazing issues that needs to be fixed since the overall balance is serisouly skewed
---
True. I guess you're right.
---
Seen a few examples of hunters like that.  Though the hunter last night in RFC when i helped tank it for a friend the hunter in our group needed on an int staff one of the casters needed, and he did trade it to one of them after the run. That made me happy, not all are like that
---
Server?
---
Oh, I have to watch that episode. Didn’t watch it ever.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames would be it.
---
Classic expansions for sure. Its what I've been saying for years
---
Then classic isnt for you then. You dont go to a high end restaurant and say: Can I have a mc chicken?
---
Can vouch, the benefit is that when I asked for time off for wow I was met with jealousy instead of 'Really?'.
---
league isn’t an mmo. counter strike is not an mmo. they are just popular online games.
---
when people use the term mmo, they are typically referring to mmorpgs, although mmo only really means a massive population of players playing TOGETHER at the SAME TIME on the same server or able to interact with each other in a persistent world. 
---
you can’t just call a game an mmo because it had a large number of players.
---
go away
---
Good to get engineering as a hunter for them bullets.
---
I've always mained shadow priest so I thought it would be fun to test how shadow priest was in vanilla. In now lvl 48 and it's become clearer and clearer that I'm 100% useless. 
---
I just went a Uldaman to help my lvl 42 friends and even them out damaged me because I have zero AoE. 
---
How is raids gonna be like for me? I've heard there is alot of aoe.. Im okay not being the top dps, but barley being above the tank is not fun, especially when I already only have 3 spells in my rotation. Does it get any better at some point? I've also heard about bosses having a cap of 16 dots on them, so that makes me even more worried, why would anyone bring a shadow priest??
---
It’s almost like retail contains all the zones and content classic does. Curious, that
---
Layers match player count
---
I have both healer and tanked dungeons and I think the single most annoying thing for each is:
---
As a healer: when someone (tank included) pulls when you’re oom so you have to try and drink for as long as you can before healing. The tank should be watching the healers mana as much as their health.
---
As a tank: when someone else doesn’t respect markers. If we have said you need to sheep moon, that’s your top priority. Don’t use up all your mana hitting too dps and then let us wipe because you can’t sheep. Similarly don’t break cc - the tank should do this after checking the healer has mana to heal through it. Listen to the leader.
---
A priest ninjaed a 2h mace from me yesterday. I was fucking furious. They should change the game so that you cant need on what you cant wield.
---
Where you are haha
---
Lock picking isn't comparable with  other class spells, it's only comparable with professions. It takes as much work/time as a gathering profession. The rogue doesn't need anyone to get these chests usually, stealth runs were/are a thing.
---
we get it you like big black dicks
---
Would Classic+ have Draenei?
---
Yeah I usually get whispered every 15 minutes or so asking if someone can join me for a quest they have. I usually help them out because I realize that nobody "owns" mobs, and partial xp and a friend is better than no xp, a repair cost, and an enemy.
---
Looks like Quartz.
---
in your ass
---
Arugal Horde
---
True classic. No additional bullshit please.
---
Haven't started Feralas or Tanaris yet, but just hit 45. If I do just one Mara and ZF run with quests, can I otherwise level all the way to 60 just questing in the 40-60 zones I haven't touched yet? Are there any dungeons besides Mara's Rotgrip I should farm for loot as a Warr before 60?
---
Pretty much. WoW introduced me to my partner that I have been with for almost 13 years now, move country, and become a game developer.
---
I am literally a game dev because if WoW. No exaggeration.
---
That's what I'm wondering. I remember me and my bros slaying the KQ for that sweet d chain body (we never got it) .
---
Now, you have to be near max, but you can still be hanging with your bros and get that sweet Scythe drop (we haven't got it).
---
This. Please.
---
Stay away from Retail thats for sure. Not sure how WoW became what retail is now, it looks so messy in PvP fights with everyone transforming to mounts in combat and more. Just stay Classic and focus on better expansions for Classic, leave Retail to die.
---
here, take a downvote
---
If progress reset I would absolutely uninstall the game lol.
---
Were they all in the same guild? I had a run where I was the only non guild member and they needed everything "to keep it for the guild." I just said ok, cool, not for me, bye!
---
I'd say for a completely new player, Questie is ambiguous. If you want to get immersed, read the quests, and try to figure the game out by yourself, I'd skip it. If you're fine with questing made really easy, and missing the "vanilla experience", you'll love it.
---
You don’t need to switch, just make an alliance and leave that guy
---
I've had groups all need roll on certain items like Gems or patterns that no one can actually use. But never a group like this where someones attitude was just so bad aswell
---
You can milk anything with nipples.
---
Classic + but with a lot of good/QOL changes that doesn't change the core of the game (like the transmog system for example)
---
Classic+ would be great an all, but I really want the expansions too. But then in 15 years we'd just get another wow classic and so on
---
I havent played classic but sign me the fuck up for burning crusade or weath servers
---
Quit being a puss.  Horde is where it is at!  FOR THE HORDE!
---
That's stupid, just roll a new character.
---
This one should be more permanent https://discordapp.com/invite/exJacWb
---
He's saying that the game disproportionately affects developers. These numbers are pulled out of my ass for explanation purposes. 
---
Say that classic has peaked at 10,000 people so far. Would you say that's a popular game? I wouldn't. That's a relatively low number of people. But say of those 10,000 people, 98% of them are developers. That's now 9,800 developers that are slacking at work. A significant number of developers on a niche game.
---
I don't agree with him but I think that's what he's trying to say.
---
I don't think so. The high level mage was friends with the Party Leader.I messaged the guy who said "idk" in the screenshot and he said he didnt know them
---
Even just one spell change could be enough.
---
Switch improved judgement of the crusader to level 40 for ret paladin and make it an dps increase for the whole group and bam ret paladin would be needed and even if only 1 guy.
---
The problem is, even if people can use it, they opt to not do so and sell it instead. If rolling need would souldbind it, I'd be more inclined to adopt this attitude as well for World-drop BoE epics.
---
Try this one https://discordapp.com/invite/exJacWb
---
They can do everything they think is the right path, but please keep the max level cap at 60. Thank you!
---
Sure but the map also has central locations for both factions to gather, and that helps alot.   
---
I also think crz and dungeon finder ruined the social part of it just like you say.
---
I installed it but it seems to only be able to add notes to the world map. How do you add notes to players?
---
I got kek om rattlegore :)
---
Well you see raiding is quite micro intensive though not very difficult it requires interrupts dispels fast ad clearing positioning resource management etc
---
Just pick one and stick to it because at the end of the day it doesn’t matter to reddit. You’ve waste enough time grinding t0 the 30’s if you pick one and stick to it you’d probably almost be 60.
---
I loved TBC and Wrath at the time but have 0 desire to revisit them.  
---
Classic+ might be bad, but it might be great, at the very least it'll be something new. Just dont start Classic+ until nax has been out a good while.
---
That's a terrible experience to have. I'm going to avoid joining random pug groups. More reason to do dungeons with only Guildies if you're able to.
---
I feel you.
---
You can always shadow word: pain a critter or two as you run long stretches, to feel better about yourself.

---
Wait, what? They removed the attunements?? Cause at least tbc started out with the most attunement we’ve seen so far.
---
What gear?
---
As horde, fuck EK.
---
I played one before and in pvp it was quite viable if you play around traps.
---
Seems like your stuck deciding between Firm and Steroid
---
You're obligated to be an ass if you're a rogue. I'm in favour of killing every horde scum I come across (unless they're higher level than me of course). 
---
Also... Watch your back if you're on the boat between Ratchet and Booty Bay, I'll be starting shit as soon as we're through the loading screen.
---
Classic+. 
---
Just look how successful OSRS is with the same model.
---
Just tried The Hinterlands and got a clam after my fifth try.
---
If you don't play what you really feel like playing, yoi won't be happy playing this game.
---
If you really want to switch and don't, it will bug you. Lvl 15 is an evening's worth of play time, so now is the moment, imo.
---
Just do your research not to pick a server where H:A ratio is too bad.
---
HandsUp
---
remember to check the bow speed, some of them are really fast spending alot more arrows.
---
Since you used that word, we can be bff's.
---
I think questing both in classic and retail just isn't WoW's strong point. Wow has never done questing right. They get a few iconic ones right but overall it's just not good. I wish they'd do more questlines like Warlock greenfire or some of the other class specific ones.
---
Kill, fight, die
---
I mean, everyone has his own way to play the game.... but why?
---
Or a dungeon in caverns of time where we stop the TBC every happening? :)
---
THAT'S WHAT A SOLDIER SHOULD DO
---
I think classic+ would be the best method. Take a leaf from old school RuneScape, implement a polling system and let the community decide what they want. 
---
Essentially, people don't want an easy game anymore and I feel like going down the DLC route is the path to an easier game...
---
what are u doing not having them on your bar?
---
Why is this being downvoted?  Plenty of warriors have no problem finding groups, and gearing up from dungeons definitely makes leveling via quests much easier.  Currently 40's on my warrior and can say the same.
---
Even for the US, this was posted at a time most people are asleep
---
I sold mine for 3g. Not sure what they are worth though.
---
Duuude same. I keep having to abandon quests hoping that ill remember to get them back when i have more room in my quest log
---
If u sort by new then ur the problem
---
I want tbc and wotlk. After that i don't care
---
Deadly should be an unused poison, takes too long to build up more than 3 stacks(3 stacks it what it needs to out dps instant) on anything but bosses and in raids it’s not allowed due to debuff slots(as stated) so it’s only use is dungeon bosses which means you would have to usually override an instant poison before doing a boss and also take up a bag slot. PvE is instant on MH/OH, PvP is crippling MH and healing reduction on offhand
---
moonkin can work if you do a lot of grinding for dungeon gear and consumes inbetween raids. also you just need to find a friendly guild. my guild us fine with it and seeing as im herb/alch ill be able to help my raid in other ways than just DPS
---
Happy cake day!! Absolutely agree though I was never that rich
---
Classic expansions would inherently start to ruin the game for a lot of people, especially with WotLK, and eventually result in Cata, which really did kill the game for me personally and I know a lot of others feel the same.
---
Because trickling in the other expansions is just going down the same road that ruined the game. I understand that for the raiding part tbc was probably better, but flying ruined the game as a journey by putting emphasis on powerleveling to reach the endgame. It made the world smaller.
---
Single target
---
Yeah I got kicked from a group last night for melee weaving as a hunter because I was bored, also my autos crit for 180 which is what my mongoose strike does, and my weapon attack speeds line up so I don't miss any autos doing it. Tank couldnt drop it, kept asking me why I thought hunters should melee before kicking me from the group.
---
Check your weapon speed.  Ret gains massive benefit from slow, heavy weapons because SoC procs on a per minute basis, not a percentage basis.
---
It is a shame the #nochanges guys are so vitriolic about keeping hybrids in their place - it mirrors the idiocy from classic perfectly.  You could make Ret viable for at least mid range DPS by dropping 2s off the Judgement cooldown, putting SoC to 10 ppm and making Judgement refund the mana cost of the Seal you use.  Sure, you would never match up to the infinitely scaling warriors, but then once you reach a certain level of DPS you just die anyway due to threat.
---
We need an Omar NPC somewhere in game. This is a change we can get behind. Should just be an NPC that patrols the whole world.
---
A lot of this doesn't really follow, plenty of the classic WoW community likes "leveling grind", and people don't dislike gear resets because of an aversion to linear gearing, if anything they dislike gear resets because of they way they *disrupt* linear gearing.
---
Like if all you mean is just to not raise the level cap, okay, but that's far from what Guild Wars 2 does, which is far more radical and destroys the entire structure of WoW Classic's endgame.
---
Apparently they brought out a single this year: https://open.spotify.com/album/6G7N8GyO4OOQMwxeQohrE3?si=RVgGKwxzRFWOUCHDmTo6jg

Scarlet raid and.... KARAZHAN

I think it can be a good meme at times...however this particular post doesn't really fit the format of this meme and it isn't used properly.
---
Classic+ 1000000000000000000%
---
I love TBC and WotLK to death but they ruin the point of Classic.
---
Ret Paladin in Wrath was my favourite time playing WoW. I quit after they gutted it in Cata basically.
---
Wow classic +

Seems like you are stuck between being a low-bandwidth worm and an actual decent MMO player type.  Fuck you again!

TOP OF THEIR GAME, EARNING THEIR NAME
---
Ah, you mean that one could click on an item and then the trading window opens already populated with the itwm and its price.
---
I didn't want ro do that because I want people to communicate before trading instead of just spamming the merchant with trading windows that pop up in any situation. Furthermorw, the range of my addon is greater than the trading range.
---
Does anyone have a guide or a website that can figure out what quests I've done and show me ones that I havent? Level 34 human paladin
---
THEY WERE THE DEVIL DOGS
---
Yes a flying horde boat.
---
&gt;The gaming experience on a low pop server is very bad.
---
I play on firemaw. Almost never below High pop, usually full. 
---
I can tell you that the experience is very similar there, not for healers, but for tanks. There just aren't enough to go around. 
---
This is not a dungeon finder issue though, it's an issue with perception, I think. The only class that most people will want tanking for them is warrior, when in reality both druids and paladins/shamans should reasonably be able to tank dungeons with no issues. 
---
Anywho, I don't want a dungeon finder. The reason being once you've found a tank, you can get to know him or her, get happy when you see it online, and try to join up with them. Dungeon finder kills communities, lfg builds them.
---
If they gave us a WotLK server I’d just play that I think.
---
Granted I dicked around doing professions for a bit and am really bad with routes (I'll fly/boat to another zone just to finish a breadcrumb then go back with maybe one new quest to show for it) and just hit 45 with about 5 1/2 days played as Warrior. I wanted to hit 60 with no more than 10 full days /played as a self-challenge to beat the "Warrior struggle" but oh well, it's more fun fucking around and feeling the world than trying to beat a timer
---
Still nuts that mid-40s is halfway to 60 though
---
Do it yourself you ganker scum.
---
Guidelime works fine and has good guides
---
Agreed. I’ve been healing dungeons as a FPS spec just fine. Granted, I’ve yet to do anything beyond Armory, so idk about lvl 40-60 content
---
There were some good class changes in TBC though
---
what if adapt tbc wotlk etc to classic standards, no lfg, no flying, no catchup mechanism and stuff like that ...
---
Also no dailies and weeklies, either...
---
Sharing your Internet connection with family/housemates/etc? Torrent programs can quickly and easily overload your router with connections, even if the bandwidth usage is minimal. DHT in particular is exceptional at doing it.
---
This “classic+” is like a neckbeards dream. What new content you want for classic ? More bosses without mechanics ? Already seen raids on live going with 20 rogues/warriors or pure dps classes(frost mage spamming 1 button xd)
---
Just go for Expansion servers, every expnsion made the game better, viable specces, talent trees changed, more complicated bosses, challenging/harder end game content, content for tryhards playing all day and people playing 1h maximum, cross realm play(no idea why people hate on this, not talking about sharding, but being able to play with friends on other realms...or work collegues), and much much more.
---
Best of each for me
---
Classic/TBC - abaolutely nothing, maybe lvling experience but after you do it couple times it sux
---
Wrath - professions/enchants
---
Cata - nothing (Vashjr art ?)
---
Mop - classes
---
Wod - raids
---
Legion - class halls
---
Bfa - art team
---
They also planned a "Death knight" during Vanilla. Would love to see their concept on that. Obviously, it would be vastly different from the retail version.
---
Thanks!
---
I like the farm things that are just underneath my experience gaining range, that way I don't get any experience and I know I will get the gold I need before I hit level 40
---
Hopefully he stays that way
---
But what would you do with those skills? There's no content anymore.
---
Bro you sound pretty toxic, are you a pserver player?
---
Much of the Silithus stuff wasn't added until patch 1.8 (the major update before AQ opened) when players could start doing Silithus quests and getting rep and this vendor and recipes were added then.
---
Patch 1.8 would correspond to Phase 4 since that is the phase the Green Dragons are being added and they were added in patch 1.8 along with this vendor.
---
Why don't you like 10 mans?
---
Yeah, I’m not really complaining because its still fun, but when all your guildies are like 30-40+, maybe its time to start focusing on something.
---
Right click them and click ‘Edit note’
---
For me, I get tired of questing by the time I hit 20 which is about the level you can start dungeon farming. So I do that for a few levela and then I find it hard to go back to questing. Not that I'm love dungeon farming, but I just can't jump back into quests. I don't mind farming dungeons though. I like the progress and the people you meet.
---
I see, I'm still of the "drag files into the addon folder" generation.
---
Since I was too late to play TBC, I would love to experience it...
---
Lmao. Lvling as a warrior myself and tanked this place, and I lit them all up as well hahah. We wiped but warlock had a soulstone on the priest so we all ressed up, and all the mobs were split into 2 packs and with having a mage + piercing howl killing we killed them super easy. 
---
Luckily only lost 3-5 minutes of time from wiping, would've been more if we had to run back but it was pretty smooth even with that stuff up hahah
---
God, I don't even use target frames because I prefer nameplates, this hotfix has completely fucked how I prefer to play.
---
Don't click them I think that's your problem.  Bind wand/macro to a keybind.
---
Sucks people can have different opinions and tastes, doesn‘t it? Shouldn‘t be so narrow minded. It‘s a game after all.
---
Absolutely, my brother, I also spam trade-&gt;conjured food with my mage, parties be needing them tanks for the dungeons, mon.
---
Keep it to option one(true classic), it might be the more boring path - but at-least we aren’t taking a gamble on activation ruining the only good version of WoW the community has. Plus there could be interesting ways of doing the true classic route without it becoming boring. 
---
Fuckdivison and Blizzard  just can’t be trusted anymore for me.
---
&gt;Stop and think about this for a minute. How would the product of the lessons learned from 15 years of WoW be any different than just the next expansion they’re going to release? Especially when each expansion basically wipes the slate clean more or less (Garrisons, Artifacts, Cataclysm world revamps, etc). Unless you get a completely new team to do WoW 2, that’s essentially the same thing except with a different storyline.
---
Except that's not at all the case because they would be making a game from the ground up with the beat features they've had over the years. Imagine an online world where we don't have flying, rdf, etc, but we do have much better ui, much better graphics, expanded talent trees or some other form of progression, rewarding levelling experience, meaningful professions, etc. 
---
&gt;The team making shadowlands or whatever it’s going to be called is making that expansion in good faith coming from this exact same perspective.
---
I have no doubt that the wow team for retail wants what's best for the game, but some of the bigger problems with retail go much deeper than can be fixed by adding new content. Let's take something such as the unrewarding and dull levelling experience as an example. This cannot be fixed by adding new content. They would need to go back and revamp a lot of the older content to fix that, but by now there is so much old content that revamping it would be a herculean task. That's just unfeasible from a business perspective. Building a new game from the ground up, they can keep in mind that the levelling should still be fun after x expansions, by for example making the max level static over expansion and just adding more content similarly to how guild wars 2 handled expansions and max level. 
---
&gt;For all intents and purposes WoW 2 already happened a long time ago. It was called Cataclysm.
---
I agree with this mostly. But it was a shitty sequel and most of us here know it.
---
Weird versioning system, 1.13 is supposed to be after 1.8
---
The first one is basically just for the P-server scene. Who have been doing nothing else for the last 14 years than to reset their chars and start  anew.
---
Love when Disarm is blocked or parried /s
---
Areas and their quests could be a way to attune for raids and unlock dungeons. For example, you need Revered with some factions to unlock Nexus, and Exalted to unlock Heroic Nexus. You put their tabard on and do their quests. Rep grind could be a little easier since we would need to unlock a lots of stuff, but still it could a form of progression.
---
Yeah and cost 5k gold unless you weelre a member of best class.
---
Then 310s were introduced as arena rewards.
---
Whatever way they chose, I would like the option to have my characters playable on a "forever 1.12 vanilla" server as long as WoW exists.
---
Yes. But seemingly a lot of people believe classic is the second coming of jesus, ignoring that it had a lot of pointless shit in it.

Why not the next 14 hours of your life?

Happy questing!
---
Just take your time to drink time after time. It's not retail, it's fine to stop for a while.
---
Did the fix the name plate distance thing everyone was doing? 
---
I saw we got a new patch today.
---
It's either hamstring, play with a priest, or spend half your playtime gathering food and first aid
---
I don’t mean to say that the meme is inherently wrong/bad; but purposely making a porn actress look like a child with the pigtails, unicorn shirt, braces, etc. rubs me the wrong way. But that’s a discussion for another subreddit.
---
That doesn't solve anything. There are many more ways to alter a game in a way that takes it to other direction, than those that already happened. Yes, you won't get to retail, but you very much can end up somewhere where it just isn't wow anymore.
---
Here's the thing we never thought about with dungeon finder. If the norm is for people to spend 45 minutes getting a party and travelling to then running the dungeon for another 45 minutes then that is the EXACT SAME RELATIVE PROGRESSION as the norm being to spam three dungeons in 2 hours. 
---
Sure you will have better gear with the dungeon finder route because you are killing stuff three times but so will everyone else so that won't help you PUG a raid spot. So all that time we thought we were getting ahead. But really we were just grinding through the content faster and faster.
---
Still normal etiquette to wait. As OP said he clearly knew what they were waiting for :-)
---
&gt;makes it more immersive in my opinion, you don't know how to effectively use the weapon since you've never used it before
---
Hitting low lvl mobs for an hour to raise an arbitrary stat is immersive? Well, each to their own.

Yes - intl flight on Lufthansa
---
As it is now. 1st one is contrary to MMORPG idea. 2nd one would be against retail and if we are at that point they ahould probably focus on a WoW 2.0, an entirely new game, not just an expansion or a re-release. 3rd one is the most viable, basically the way it is now.
---
Main reason were Draeney, that brought demons to Draenor. Orcs were fine before them.
---
Would you be happier about a couple of blues and a slow mount or a shower of legendaries?
---
How about keep the skills and specs at v2.0.1. The prepatch before TBC released. Rescale skills to be available &lt;61 of course.
---
If classic+ does become a thing, I would be ok with a barber that only changes hair. No face changes and no gender changes. Its a barber not a plastic surgeon.
---
I really like the idea of Classic+, but I had absolutely the most fun during WotLK.  I'd love a release that stays there but doesn't go further.
---
Classic+ sounds amazing. Learn where they went wrong with expansions and redo the thing towards a better experience of extra content.
---
What was everybody doing? I Feel somewhat out of the loop here
---
&gt; toons
---
Why are people still using toontown terms?
---
its very difficult if u cant find weapon upgrades
---
I was just about to ask for an addon list :)
---
Thanks! Do you prefer to install via twitch app?
---
Redevelopment of the game in a new direction. Have a look at old school runescape if you have doubts - having a game function as a time capsule does not work in the long term, you HAVE to develop it.
---
Loved BC for the experience I had with people and the gameplay as a ret and rogue back then. But you completely nailed why I prefer Vanilla over TBC. Thanks !
---
Had the same issue with it still showing a Q to turn in, /reload fixes it in about 4 seconds, much faster than a relog for future reference :)
---
Be more amazed - here is internet that was connected for 11 hours straight at 32k ft
---
This hasn't been the case in my experience, I'm not sure where you are finding these toxic players, everyone seems pretty normal. This feels super exaggerated to fit a narrative.
---
hyperbole. you can quest just fine everywhere except in STV.
---
Sorry you had this specific experience and were not able to get sufficient closure or catharsis by either calling them out in General chat or Whispering them privately to guilt them.
---
They added this feature way back even they prioritized immersion over gameplay to some degree. Personally I'm a fan of the feature - being able to see that they're talking, but being unable to read it because I don't know the language. And it works almost flawlessly to this day. They just need to make it random in a way that it's consistent for everyone involved, but impossible to decipher (each message is hashed with a random number)
---
If Blizzard had created WoW today, I'm positive that they'd either make cf communication impossible or make it easy. I don't think they expected people would decipher their algorithm and reverse engineer it to be able to speak x-faction.
---
Change your resolution and put it in windowed mode

"World of Warcraft 2020"
---
The new expansion after BFA will be a chimeric merging of Classic WoW and Retail WoW. Characters on Classic servers will enter the Dark Portal where the level cap will stay 60. BFA Players will also enter the Dark Portal, where their level will normalize to 60.
---
Game content will be of a Classic+ variety. No to Raid Finder. Yes to never-before-seen 40-person raids. Occasionally sprinkle in the good raids from Wrath such as Icecrown, but Level 60. Bring back 8-piece gear sets.
---
i dont like pets ... i love frost so much without the pet :(
---
Isn’t lady Prestor Onyxia?
---
Well raid items bind on pickup so you wouldnt waste points on something you dont need any way. Say you get 10 points per boss completed or what ever when an item you need drops you can bid your points for the item highest bid wins and then those points are spent so youll need to build them back up again to compete for a loot drop. Raiding also isnt just about the loot. Its about building friend ships and just enjoying being able to down the hardest bosses in wow with the community yove become  a part of. If you are just there to gear and leave you are going to hate it
---
Whatever happens you should have to choose to 'graduate' your character off the true classic server. If the original classic servers change then we'll be back at square one with private servers for true classic. The plus option is the most exciting to me. I'd love to see alot of the early promises seen to fruition, I always wanted to see the dishonor system implemented in a meaningful way.
---
Quartz and ClassicCastBar (this one os only to see the enemy cast bar)
---
I might be missing the point but what is so outlandish about it?
---
World PVP just got a whole lot harder
---
The clear dividse happens between early wrath and late wrath.
---
I remember logging on to patch 3.3 and being utterly flabbergasted about these new dungeon entrances at the foot of icecrown being basically just for show.
---
The third option would fragment the playerbase too much. And less populated servers (like Cataclysm [which I really liked]) would end up like private servers with so few players it’s virtually unplayable :(
---
Not sure about the completed ones, but there's an addon called Questie which is very helpful in finding and completing quests.
---
Some people do say it takes away the feeling of vanilla, in having to find everything.
---
But it just reduces the times I have to look stuff up on the wiki.
---
"Cool! Dinner AND a show" continues munching.
---
Personally i would want the expansions. Purely because I started in tbc and just as I hit 70 wotlk came out.
---
Would be so much nostalgia for me
---
But classic+ seems more possible. Old school Runescape has done it
---
Did the dragon drop anything?
---
Yeah and that'd be why it appeals to a small group of people. Over the years these private servers have had to either shut down or reset after a couple of years and everyone would start fresh.
---
I'm not sure it'd be something I would be into though
---
Mother must be other reasons why you play there that make it a worthwhile, fun experience.
---
Do you trust the current people in charge of World of Warcraft to be able deliver on an authentic Classic experience? I don’t have much faith in them
---
New Game+ (kind of like DS)
---
Ability to restart play through with your stats reduced by a fixed percentage (making enemies harder to kill) while showing on your nameplate whether you’re playing standard, NG+, NG++, etc. 
---
Nameplate would indicate your skill level, and by reducing your stats instead of increasing enemy stats would still allow you to play along with players on a different difficulty level.
---
Snape kills Dumbledore!
---
I'm not gonna no life in classic as I have in some expansions but Im still worried I'll feel useless in raids.
---
 Rerolling healer seems much more attractive gameplay wise as then I actually have more than 3 spells, but I really wanted to give shadow a try.
---
#nochangesiamgettingconfusedbythem
---
Maybe? (:
---
Have never heard of such a utility, so don't think so.
---
I have no doubt that the wow team for retail wants what's best for the game, but they are too deep in shitty design decisions now. They can't remove flying, lfr, lfd, etc because it would piss off a lot of players. They can't make levelling more engaging and rewarding because there's 120 levels to revamp the content of which is just unfeasible from a business perspective. They can't remove pet battles, store mounts, etc because the shareholders would set them on fire.
---
They can , however, pitch an entirely new game and hope it gets through the board...
---
Agreed, but at any rate I think this topic has been discussed 'at length' on all the NSFW subreddits at one time or another.
---
New players have a choice. Try to find people to start on a lower tier with them, join an endgame guild, or (most likely) join a mid-tier guild working on progressing themselves. Guilds have turnover, and these guilds need to recruit new players periodically. This also gives these guilds an incentive to farm previous content, as they’ve got to get their recruits up to a standard where they can be useful. Before WoW introduced gear resets with each expansion, guilds had **years** worth of content to work through.
---
This isn’t theoretical: this is how it was before WoW set this standard. The raiding community from previous games were shocked that TBC made Vanilla endgame worthless, because it completely invalidated all prior progression. And character progression has always been a key driver in MMORPGs. I don’t see this as any different from the other well-intentioned anti-hardcore mechanics from Retail such as /LFG, flying mounts, and gear score.

Best warrior tank I've seen yet used a 2h to Whirlwind the pack 2-3 times before switching to Prot Stance with a shield. We could use AoE after the first whirlwind already.
---
You honestly will perform way better if you keybound once you got used to it. There's not a single person that wouldn't. It literally allows you to focus your attention elsewhere and press a cd when things go wrong, instantly as a tank.
---
Send a doctor to Monkeynews, he actually does this...
---
Its not an exciting life but its mine.
---
Do you realise how shit Outland would be without flying? The zones are unnecessarily large, a problem which persisted through expansions until legion where they started compacting the zones.
---
Shift or Ctrl mousewheel will do it too.
---
True classic without the resets
---
But if everyone is expected to green why not save the ninja drama and have everyone need? It’s a prisoners dilemma
---
Seems impossible to please people with a classic+.
---
What I really want is for them to make a new game with classic as a template.
---
Well said! I started maybe six months before BC came out and I loved that expansion. Well, other than the fel reavers. Fuck those guys.
---
Nice try, China
---
Forcing players to reset their progress is a surefire way of killing classic.
---
I want a new alternate timeline where we ditch everything related to BC and future expansions.
---
That fits in with the rpg elements that classic had. This option would have my vote
---
Having the design of the game dictated by reddit brigades is literally my nightmare.
---
Amen to this! I've also wondered why people need an "app" for installing an add-on. New times and all that, but interface/addons still works fine.
---
Human doesn't get 15% spirit.
---
Desolace, I farmed 60 gold from 36-40 in the desert just killing everything (especially the lizards) at work now so I can't post coordinates but it's left side of desolace just next to the mountain. Run the small dune part up and down, there should always stuff to kill there.
---
If wotlk released, I would probably actually sub. Or even TBC, but wotlk even more so.
---
Reason: nostalgia, purely.
---
I understand your point, I can't play without Questie as well (I played retail up to TBC, and lots of pservers). The game hasn't aged well in that regard. But I think I make a valid point as well, a completely new player who wants to know what all this fuss is about, will propably have some fun figuring quests out by themselves. If they get fed up and say "fuck, I'm going to get help", is perfectly fine as well.
---
Wait what?!?
---
This is the ClassicLFG Addon currently.
---
I would love classic plus but I now so many people are only playing in anticipation of BC. If they could release expansions and a classic plus I’d be down for that. But honestly either would be great
---
classic + all the way ! Rewrite the warcraft history, better, and dont casualise the game as was done the first time around
---
There's a breadcrumb quest in the dark part of ironforge to go to the slaughtered lamb inn, in Stormwind.

Classic Expansions, if - for nothing else - the class improvements that we got in burning crusade and wrath.
---
&gt; /run SetCVar("nameplateMaxDistance","6e1")
---
Ye, that one does not work anymore.
---
This might well be part of the reason. I guess I haven't had any experience putting together a full PUG group in Classic yet (though I often did back in vanilla), but I've done a few with some people from my guild, where we've had to PUG extra DPS, and we were able to get people almost instantly. Those were lower level dungeons though, so probably more people at those levels currently.
---
Are you me? I was all “oh yeah I’m gonna tank and it’ll be great” .. that lasted until level 11 when I got fed up, gave up, and made an intentionally ugly gnome mage instead. Now I live true happiness.
---
Suramar is the only decent quest line Blizzard has done in the last three expansions as far as I am concerned and it took a dedicated zone and effort to achieve that. Whilst classic may not have the flash of retail (no cutscenes, most of the story delivered through dialog and letters) the integrity of its writing on average is far superior.   
---
Take the RFC quests for example, not just the Hidden Enemies quest line but all of the side quests you can find that tie in with Shadow Council and [Neeru Fireblade](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=3216), it paints a hidden war going on within the walls of Ogrimar in a discoverable, grounded and logically consistent way it sets up and foreshadow events that can play out in the later parts of your leveling experience.
---
Saved
---
For me, the big ”retail problems” are in regards of people not communication, and the outside worls being ”dead” so I just have a few wishes for eventual expansions:
---
Dont add flying mounts. Let people travel the way we do right now in classic!
---
Dont add LFG system.
---
Honestly, the auto find group function is fine in my eyes. But do NOT add the teleport function. Run people run!
---
And dont tune dungeons to steamroll-mode. Force us to communicte regrding cc’s, pulls etc
---
Relax, there's still a lot of time before we even talk about the future of WoW. There are things in Vanilla that aren't even implemented in Classic, and once we finally get to the last iteration of Classic, and we really need to actually brainstorm about what comes after, you'll already be 60 with multiple toons.
---
Can confirm. I got a “well I (my boss) should be able to understand this if anything”.
---
For the slow (it's a faster cast) and/or last hit
---
You're mostly right and so I think people who are in favour of this would have the server resets be quite far apart: 18 months to 2 years I would assume. I could see maybe a yearly reset though. 
---
Also worth noting, this would very likely be an opt in feature. Just like D3 resets, you won't lose everything if you don't want anything to do with it.
---
Again, not advocating for it and I'm not sure it is something I'd be into but I'm also very hesitant trusting Blizzard with a Classic+ or with going into BC and so on.
---
Not to mention uldum!

#MakeTBCGreatAgain
---
Yeah it’s pretty funny, two runs. Got bracers and shoulders last lockout and Helm chest pants gloves and bow this lockout. Using it to farm my epic mount now I don’t have to worry about gearing anymore haha
---
We played in a 5 man grp the first week. We often found aoe mages grinding, but as a grp could easily take over their spots (esp hillsbrad) , or killed the alliance ones. Was quite fun
---
Rank 1 frostbolt is a key thing to learn to take advantage of.
---
That airbrushing makes his eyes look oddly dissimilar.
---
I would not consider this the main selling point for an MMO... But considering that half of the FFXIV community consists of thirsty weeb bois, showcasing their love for half naked beast type races, it might as well be one of the most prominent selling points. For real... FFXIV's subreddit sometimes reaches depths regarding furry fantasies and daddy issues that it's almost unreal.
---
&gt; it introduced basically everything that killed WoW
---
you serious?
---
Stop.
---
Exactly. They have a massive and unwieldy vessel which has been through too many wrong turns and patch-jobs to be worth sailing at this point. 
---
*Start over*
---
In my experience with toxic pserver players, they’ll tell you you’re an idiot because of how things work on their servers.
---
No they didn't. They started with like 4, two for each two weeks before release when it should have been 10 for each. Putting out a couple of servers just days before release isn't anywhere close to good enough.
---
Release spirit.
---
1.13 is the FIRST patch of classic.
---
The other patches were for vanilla WoW. If this was 1.12 completely AQ, BWL, Naxx would all be opened, there would be AV, WSG, and AB battlegrounds, etc...
---
Nobody likes being proven wrong, especially if it is your work.
---
[deleted]
---
I would like wipes every like two years.
---
For me, the whole appeal of an official Blizzard server is so my characters won't get deleted. If I put hundreds of hours in doing things like getting every tailoring pattern, getting BiS gear, finding cool shit... Only to login and find it all gone one day but with the game still running. That's just soul crushing.
---
One day Wow will shut down, and I'll be sad that day. But hell would have no fury if they just deleted my effort to "refresh" like a private server.
---
Can confirm. Some alliance attacked me and in badlands near the stone elementals, I lured them back while hoping some allies would show up. 3 Other horde showed up so it was 4v3 at that point, we killed them all then they revived and regrouped to try again. We pushed them back east to the neutral quest giver where we killed them for the 2nd time. During that a level 40 paladin on his mount rolls up during the fight. He never lifted a finger, he never even targeted one of us, only stood back trying to I assume read his quest. The moment we finished with the group of 3 ALL of us turned to that poor soul.
---
No truer words were spoken.
---
What original idea for Classic Hellfire paninsula?
---
I'm a hunter and I also stop drinking. Just tell them to slow down or just let them die and the will learn.
---
I did this last night! We got to that room and the group asked if the dungeon was over. I said I remember from something from vanilla about these candles and proceed to light them all. I made it through 3 before we got mobbed. Corpse run for us all but we got them on the second try.
---
Is that the fucking Rohirrim?
---
Classic+ but I like the idea of Classic Expansions if before an expansions gets released players have the option to "upgrade" their account to one that has access to Classic Expansions or to stay in Classic as it is, different servers is what I mean basically.
---
When you do the hunter quest and tame a beast with that quest taming rod the pet is the same size as in the wild. Once you tame a pet with tame beast ability it scales down.
---
Classic + i want 40 man raid for BC keep the 40 man mentality and tune them around and turn kara into the TBC UBRS and let us run it as much as we want. then do the expacs in order but returning and reworking to keep core classic game play.
---
While I agree that TBC was awesome and it holds a special place in my heart, the downside of this would be that WoW classic would be played only on Outland. This problem has always plagued WoW with every retail expansion. There's no incentive to return to 1-60 zones if the end game takes place in Outland with flying mounts.
---
They would have to find a solution for this problem.
---
Lol to all the people saying that you should have waited, fuck em. They didn't respond and even if they were tabbed out or were not paying attention, it's their own fault.
---
Bottom line is, they should have responded. You did the right thing and just because they are butthurt little kids, don't feel bad.
---
Should have went for infinite +1
---
You can beat the mage if he is afk. Ez win.
---
Is it fair to introduce newbies to what "All the fuss is about" when the vast vast majority of players are using a questie addon? Is that really the game everyone's talking about?
---
I feel like the raw no addon game is played by very few people, and the people who say "Try without questie for your first time!" are all being misleading since basically none of them are playing without that or some equivalent mod.
---
I don't view classic as a nostalgia trip to 2004, it is a great MMO that holds up all on its own with a couple QoL fixes. And I want to share that version of classic with people since I'm playing it and know it's good.
---
So there was one guy at the end who DID link. I'm omw to work now but will dl as soon as I get home. Thank you!
---
Why do you think flying killed wow? When it was just in Outland it was a great addition, it made that part of the world feel special compared to Azeroth, and many of the zones complemented the feature. Letting us fly in Northrend and later Kalimdor and EK was the true mistake imo.  
---
Dailies sucked, kinda. But with all the added reputation grinds they were also a bit necessary, it wasn't as bad then as it is now. I agree the game is better without dailies.  
---
Heroics, and having to grind reputation for the key etc was great, that's the good kind of padding that the game needed at the time. Vanilla was all about spending ridiculous amounts of time for slightly higher numbers, heroics were the perfect evolution of that. It was like a one time prestige, you did all this and have BiS now? Go do it again but slightly harder. I definitely don't agree heroics were bad.  
---
Fuck badges and any kind of arbitrary currency. 100% agree. Except _maybe_ honor badges, but the game can live without them just fine.  
---
Corridors, eh, don't really care either way. Could be more creative, but I get that they saved time, time that went into much more interesting boss mechanics.  
---
YES, Epics should be, you know, _epic_. Not normal, not expected. Funny how after Epics became the standard Legendaries started to fall victim to this effect as well. Definitely a screw up.  
---
Don't really care about stat ratings. Just a QoL improvement for people who care, but anyone serious or actually good wouldn't pay attention to them.  
---
Resilience made PvP a distinct part of the game, I actually really like that. It made PvP something to spend time on, because it gave its own set of gear.  
---
Don't really get what you mean with class/faction homogenization.  
---
Hub cities were cool, but unnecessary. Don't really care either way.  
---
Fuck portals.  
---
Attunements were basically replaced with rep grinds. I think the rep grinds fit the game more than a simple quest. But I can understand that people don't agree.  
---
Yeah, limited time stuff really is a killer. It's actually what made me quit retail, I just want to be able to play a few hours a week, but progression raiding became impossible because I needed to farm mindless content for badges to improve my BiS gear, because BiS simply isn't BiS on its own... Fuck that.  
---
TBC also added lots of great stuff. Better class balance, higher quality boss content, better raids, more things to do, etc. I think it was a great expansion of the base game.
---
It'd be nice if we got some new sets built with other specs in mind.  Shadow priest sets, ret pally sets, non healing druid sets...  
---
It'd be nice to give the, well, underappreciated classes when it comes to gear  some new toys to play with that maybe could drag them into the limelight a bit more.  If we are going to start with some horizontal progression then giving gearsets built towards those less utilized specs would be a fun addition that I don't think people would mind.
---
I got kicked out for helping another group kill the elite dwarf in wetlands.. They were about to get killed until my gnome ass took charge and aggrod. I died in the process but atleast they got the kill. The group thanked me while my own group kicked me out. That's toxic wow for ya
---
I think the second is better. And they can create a story with Nozdormu and the time dragons and create a different, parallel timeline that we can play in.
---
Same just go at 1.
---
I went for it at level 20, only getting hit after. Turned out good, as alliance I fight a lot of humanoids with weapons at the 20-25 range.
---
I was thinking hovering mounts. Just keep the flying mounts and make them hover and move at the same speed. There are a lot of important areas you need a mount to get to so this wouldn’t break that feature, you can still travel faster, mobs without ranged abilities won’t aggro you, but you can be possibly dismounted from an enemy player just like normal mounts. You would just fly at a height within raged ability distance
---
Levelling with daggers is a bit rough, you need a mainhand mace or sword and make a macro to equip it before you sinister strike.
---
Male orc too fat
---
Yeah, this happen to me too. After the last update I tried to re-install the addon than I check every single box on the config. Now It os working Just fine. I Hope It work for you too!!
---
Well, for years to come, that's more relying on the future expansions we know will come to retain that player base. It's like the first time around. We will develop these characters for the next 18 months and then inevitably, even people who do not like burning Crusade, they will feel the sense of attachment to their characters and they will want to continue them into burning Crusade.
---
Remember, they can make different by making tier 1-2-3 obsolete by making the new raid HUGE arcane magic attack. So you need huge resistance gear. Which T4 does have.
---
But there is no increase in DPS. Just better resistance to specific magic spells. That is what they should go for then "increase STR / INT and so on"
---
Improves the player experience or leveling speed? 
---
Don't get me wrong, it's a great addon - but it kind of changes the game into "go to this yellow marker, then this, then that, then cash in". If you only care about reaching level 60, then that's a great addon - but for me, it does take away a lot from the immersion and the journey.
---
Move the portrait to the center of the screen. Easy fix if that is your main reasoning.
---
Oh shit. It’s my cake day, thanks. 
---
It just took time to get rich. At the time, chatting on AIM and listening to low quality Blink 182 tracks from limewire helped:
---
Tauren are not enought RARE for me to enjoy ^(I will see myself out)
---
I’d make it if Blizzard don’t propose us to keep it the way it is now without touching anything ;)
---
I don’t understand this 5 second rule. In fact, I don’t really get spinal tap either. 
---
Can someone ELI5? Or know where I could maybe find some more-detailed descriptions? 
---
Any help appreciated!
---
Indeed. And now we know better so why shoukd it not improved upon
---
Ticket a GM for recovery.
---
In my opinion, some of the damaging features the following:
---
Flying mounts, for obvious reasons.
---
The world design of Outland. They completely sanctioned off the 60-70 content away from Azeroth and gave no reason to go back: even Ironforge and Orgrimmar were made invalid by Shattrath City. As a result, it started this bad habit of having all the expansion content be sanctioned off in its own little bubble, which has created a ton of bloat in the game overtime.
---
All the lore retcons they added in TBC. They kinda shat on characters like Illidan and Kael'thas, turning them into one-dimensional villains. Additionally, the retcons made to poof the two playable races into existence were...questionable. The first race, draenei, kinda came out of left field and were nowhere near the actual Draenei established in both Warcraft III and Vanilla (called Lost Ones in the modern lore), and they had this overwhelming sci-fi vibe to them which doesn't really fit the medieval fantasy feel of Warcraft; looking past that, however, I will admit that I do quite like them as a race. I cannot say the same for Blood Elves; they took one of my favorite races in the entire game, high elves, and took a big dump all over them and their lore in order to cram them into the Horde. That decision was **never because the lore warranted it;** it was only because Blizzard wanted to appeal to the Asian market. This should not be the case when coming up with new races.
---
TBC had a vast amount of dungeons, but only because they had heavy amounts of asset reuse, and they all had a wing structure very similar to the Scarlet Monastery dungeon (in other words, they were all extremely linear hallways). There were never really any large-scale, nonlinear dungeons like Blackrock Depths, Stratholme, Sunken Temple, Blackrock Spire, etc. Additionally, I think just slapping a Heroic difficulty was a very lazy way of adding replayability to these dungeons; max-level dungeons should have a much more organic way of having increasing difficulty or rewards. Perhaps if you bring 6-10 people along instead of just 5, the dungeon will have extra bosses or extra mechanics you need to watch out for? Or it could be the opposite, where players are incentivized to cut their group down by 1 player; players can already do this right now to increase the difficulty of dungeons and claim more treasure for themselves (the loot only needs to be split 4 ways instead of 5, insuring about 25% more treasure for each player).
---
Arenas are pretty good on paper, and in Classic, uninstanced arenas have worked out well for adding new life to corners of the world like Stranglethorn. But the way they handled it in TBC just wasn't good for the game. They were instanced off entirely, which removes life from the open world instead of adding to it like the Gurubashi Arena did, they invalidated BGs and World PvP entirely due to the arena rewards structure, they encouraged class homogenization as PvP was getting balanced more around these group duels instead of BGs where every class can be represented and have a unique role to play, and they pushed the game in the direction of being an MMO E-sport instead of an MMO-RPG. That direction worked out real well for Retail, didn't it? I feel like arenas could still work, but only if they're uninstanced and scattered around the world with minimal to no rewards, like with the Gurubashi Arena. That way they can cultivate the group duel mode of PvP while not making the main modes of PvP that we all know and love entirely irrelevant.
---
I do like ten man raids, Kara, ZA were great, Kara is probably one of the 2 or 3 best raids every made, what I don't like are split raid difficulties.  Each raid should have a single difficulty, be it 10 or 25.
---
The third option. I want TBC, but with some changes - notably, I want some of the dungeons to be made more classic-like (like BRD or Maraudon). This could be done with the less popular instances such as Shadowlabs and Arcatraz. They could also just add a few more 5 man instances and expand Gruul's lair.
---
I also want the trash respawns removed in TBC and SSC.
---
ew
---
Where are these demons located so I know to avoid helping?
---
Then it'll be 25 mages rolling for 1 mageblade. At that rate you can gear out your raid group with Mc gear after 2 years haha
---
i agree 100%. the only thing i would want is a lfg tool where you can list your group and find groups ( no cross realm). so you limit the chat spamm.
---
Discipline and order
---
Could be either to get in the correct stance or just simply  startattack macros. I've also found that if you macro abilities, and then get new ranks, the macro will automatically update to the newest rank when you open the macro interface. Not that it really matters in this case as warrior abilities tend to always update to the newest rank anyway.
---
Stats mean more at lower levels
---
Im 42 mage
---
And i want Uldaman, but I'm Too low people keep saying grrr
---
I just want my mage quest Done!
---
I do exactly this with ma warlock reroll because my main is a war
---
Agreed. The Razelikh questline in Vanilla made me truly fall in love with WoW, but TBC cemented that love forever.

Thankfully I'm tanking and would just leave this group so they get fucked
---
Cool trailer! cant wait for them to remove layering.
---
So... are we gonna get the dedicated Shill Brigade of “Stalwarts” now?
---
You should look at Satisfactory. It's on the Epic Games Store exclusively which is unfortunate, but it's basically a 3D satisfactory and the devs have been good about releasing content on their roadmap. Really good stuff. In its current state I have easily spent 200 hours just building and rebuilding, and exploring the really neat world.
---
do at least one expansion
---
classic+ would be great, but as someone new to wow, the game is lacking in race/class variety. really the only issue i have with it. adding at least one race to each horde and alliance would do wonders for that particular issue.
---
Classic plus 100%.
---
Blizzard probably doesn't want to put too much time/money into it though. 
---
Not super into getting the later expansions. They're solid - no doubt - but re-running your stable of content is weak as fuck from an artistic point of view.
---
You pay motherfuckers to design games. Design some Classic plus shit and you'll earn way more respect from a lot of fans who are completely jaded with Acti-Blizzard that turned gaming into a Happy Meal / Training Wheel experience.
---
That’s a good shout. A slower bow, bigger hits and slower arrow expenditure. Thanks.
---
I've noticed that a bit with a buddy of mine I quest with, he's basically ignored Kalimdor this whole time.
---
Sounds miserable to me
---
Agreed.  We need at least a few servers to remain with Classic and nothing else.
---
No, TBC is when the game started going downhill. Flying mounts, arena and removing of faction-exclusive classes ruined everything.
---
Ofcourse it worth it. Musthave in pvp. But just think of idea running through a group and slowing them just by screeching.
---
I've been using handy notes for as long as I can remember and I didn't know you could do this for characters not in your friends list.
---
It is confusing but after you learn the zone its a HUGE exp boost, provided you can avoid the high level players pking everyone
---
mix between last two, mostly for no flying... so last one with a vote on features, or a per realm features?
---
&gt; World PVP just got a whole lot ~~harder~~better
---
You chose to roll Fury, now deal with it eh? 😂
---
The only problem I'm having right now is the competition for a DPS spot in dungeons, as a rogue. 
---
Used to play Warrior and Shaman but wanted to try something new for Classic, oh well.
---
Classic expansions would be cool, especially if we could decide which ones we want to play with.
---
Content is content and can be reused / repurposed. The mechanics of Vanilla and how the world was linked together is what is important.
---
I like the idea of a dungeon finder to fill a group, but the being able to teleport directly to the dungeon (without a warlock) was the problem, in my opinion
---
lol
---
As much as I loved wrath it’s something I’ve already played and I’d like something new. Besides if they were to go that route wrath is many years away and I don’t care much for TBC at all.
---
If they reset anything I’m done instantly.
---
I was in an end-game server first racing guild for Vanilla / TBC. The solution to that is actually very simple. We would have our 40 man, and some of our people already had everything they wanted from the raid. So instead of just forcing someone to spend 2-6 hours racking up repair bills and using regents for no reason, we would let that person step out and free up the class slot. Then someone from the outside could pay us ~ 10-20 gold and take that slot. We're guaranteed to clear the entire dungeon. They'd often pick up a lot of good gear that we would have DE'ed otherwise.
---
If the person was a new member of our guild, we'd take them along and just give them all the gear for their class that drops. It was rather simple to take a brand new level 60 and have him geared for Naxx within a week or two.
---
Don't forget they gave Shaman to the Alliance and Paladin to the Horde, which ruined faction identity. They should've instead added EVEN MORE faction-exclusive classes, not remove them.
---
Wholesome? WHOLESOME? As a member of the horde, you were supposed to give that elf some holes!
---
I want Classic + but I am afraid the classic team isn't big enough to undertake such a massive task. They could lend developers (art designers, dungeon &amp; raid designers, quest designers and so on) from retail, however I think the probability
---
&gt; Honestly as long as they don't fucking ruin it I'm a happy camper.
---
Pure classic it is!
---
Glad I'm not the only one on this sub from Smolderweb!
---
For real, I've always heard leveling a warrior is hard but it turns out it's just people being bad? Git good gear, hit big numbers.
---
Fair point
---
If expansion then stop at frozen throne. No panda, no cata plz
---
you DONT have a taunt with a shaman.  
---
Yes you have a high treat ability, but its not a taunt.  
---
You might be able to tank if your group is prepared for it, as in let you build treat first, but due to the lack of taunt, im not conident in it...
---
Yeah but they didn't all stop the moment burning Crusade launched in 2007. I mean, that would be unbelievable.
---
Anyway something something unaddressed burnout is always a factor something something
---
Yesterday we did it with 43 war, 42 hunter, 42 mage, 44 rogue and me 44 spriest healing it... wiped 4 times on last boss because of two big adds and tank cant aggro them.. then we killed it. It was fun. But yeah, go there at like 45 level and it is super easy :) We were there for like 2,5 hours with every quest done possible.
---
Nah I meant in character display :) I don't see as much stats as shown in the picture, so seems to be an addon?!
---
3 is the worst option of all, if we can't get Classic+ we better stay with Classic forever.
---
I don't see what the problem is here?
---
I am currently leveling a priest which I have never done before, and I've read up on the 5 second rule and spell down ranking. However, I feel these two concepts conflict, or I just don't understand. 
---
If I should take a break from healing for 5 seconds to get a tick or two of mana, shouldn't i *always* burst heal using high ranks of spells to be able to have longer breaks between casts?
---
For pve, troll is the best Horde race for mage. For pvp, Undead is the best Horde race for mage.
---
Being a mage is great. Being able to produce your own food and water, plus all the options you have for slowing and CCing your opponents make mages some of the strongest levelers, behind only hunters and warlocks (and technically they're even faster than hunters and warlocks if you aoe grind, but that requires a very specific playstyle and is strongly helped by layer hopping)
---
At the endgame, your ability to polymorph, aoe, and provide food and water for the group makes you a welcome addition to pretty much any 5-man group. In raids, you'll also be welcomed because of your damage output, but expect a lot of competition for gear from other mages, they're one of the most popular classes.
---
I bought about 600 of it when i posted this and I still have some left!
---
I got put on ignore yesterday for asking someone in UC for a grp invite to switch my layer because of the horrible Elemental camping in Badlands....
---
Oh and all the shitlords start crawling out of their retail caves looting and gathering Questobjectives/resources that you stand right next to fighting mobs to clear them, writing and whispering stuff like, "get rekt".
---
Don't let the retail mentality creep into Classic. 
---
Name and shame the "Me Myself and I" crowd out of the community and back into retail.
---
Does alliance get lvl 15 quests in ashenvale? I went there at lvl 17 as a horde but the first quest was level 22.
---
I kinda want burning crussade and lich king, but revised to be as classic as possible.
---
For example:
---
- changes on the Flying Mounts: while some flying is necessary for those zones, beeing able to fly infinitely and that's it is not good for pvp world and the feeling of a community. Giving the flying mounts a timer whitbyou can fly with and a cooldown could silve that. Like flying for 10 seconds. Rarer mounts or expensive ones could have this timer a bit prolongued until a max of 30 seconds 40 seconds.
---
-Changes on the powerlevel curve. (I wasnt there when it happen but( The feeling that someone full epic from raiding goes into the expansion and the first quest gives it a Green that is better than his equipment kinda makes pointless the countless hours he put in while making also pointless the previus raid zones. There should be better equipment but with the same rarity to mantaing a level of relevance on everything.
---
- No Party Finder leave it like in classic: Seeing how now is working people teaming up for questing with the chats and communicating should be the way to go.
---
- The classic difficulty should stay. 
---
And that is my opinion.
---
If i get aggro as rogue i can just evasion or vanish. Hell you can even tank a mob because vanilla dungeon is so easy it doesnt matter
---
Ah ty
---
Chain fear and /dance
---
Well, WoW forced me to learn Lua which diverted me into JS because someone said they were similar - now I'm a goddamn web-dev and I still hold the Lua tutorial accountable.
---
I am outaaaaaa here
---
I personally would have no problem if they slap a bit more raids or dungeons ontop of the game, but the gameplay and balancing should be left unchanged. Maybe just add all the stuff they wanted to add originally but were canceled due to time issues.
---
I mean, more content can't be bad, or am I wrong?
---
To me; I just need achivements, because that gave new goals and other rewards then just items, and made it fun to just do things differently. 
---
The dual spec is also something I would not mind i classic, but not until the end of all phases and make it mighty expensive, and count as a new gold reset for most. 
---
If they open up, TBC it is a deal breaker to me and I would quit (again).
---
A combination of all of the above, true classic servers for those that want them shouldn't be an issue for blizzard to keep up once we've gone through all of the phases as it will only be server costs and bug fixes.
---
I will say that even though I enjoy classic for what it is and appreciate the grind/difficulty/world building/community that comes with leveling, it's undeniable that certain classes are either boring to play or unfinished at endgame which tbc/wrath improved for the most part, it's just unfortunate that those expansions came with a bunch of crap that ultimately ruined the game I really don't think it would be too difficult to introduce the more complete rotations/abilities into classes while keeping everything balanced, there's so much potential here for blizzard to go back and fix all of their mistakes the real issue is whether or not people trust blizzard to do that without repeating their mistakes.
---
Classic+ would probably be the most rewarding option for both blizzard and players, but it would also require the most work due to them having to create brand new content that fits the feel of classic, it would be a gamble but could potentially bring WoW as a whole back into the light if they did it correctly.
---
If it were up to me I would probably say keep classic servers forever as an option for those that want it, continue up to wrath but with questionable content removed/tweaked/rebalanced to fit the core design philosophy of vanilla (i.e no dungeon finder/flying etc etc) then after that look to do either classic+ or wrath+ depending on how successful wrath was.
---
Not in Classic it doesn't.
---
Exactly. The only updates that pass polls are pvm related or making existing skills easier. There will never be another skill added to the game with the 75% polling system.
---
As a player since vanilla that maxed out every class in cataclysm, maximum characters that I'll grind here is 2. My main will be hunter and I don't need a 2nd right now. Maybe a 39 twink rogue later without mounts in bg...
---
&gt;probably felt bad for you
---
Lmao
---
&gt; It absolutely trivialized questing and travel
---
You didn't have it until you were an established 70, at which point you'd done almost all the quests and were maybe just finishing up the extras for rep and pocket money. At that point questing and travel were trivialised already.
---
&gt; and weakens the wPvP scene. 
---
I think this is the heart of it. You can't gank someone who is flying, and you can't corpse camp someone who can rez and fly away. For people whose joy mostly comes from ganking passers-by and corpse camping them, flying mounts are the absolute worst.
---
But for everyone else they are innocuous.
---
So the gankers have to make up other stories about why they hate flying mounts so much, because they don't want to admit it's just about ganking and camping.
---
&gt; The epic flying mount moves insanely fast compared to ground mounts and allows you to zip between targeted quest objectives and nodes without having to actually play the game.
---
So do epic mounts in Classic pretty much.
---
&gt; Imagine if you could just fly to the top of Jintha’alor instead of doing the minidungeon. With flying, there is no incentive to ever be on the ground.
---
Who cares, if you can only do that at a level where Jintha is trivial anyway?
---
It would be cool if Blizz just kept Vanilla playable forever.
---
I just think it's a dream we even got Classic (think about the road we took to get here). If we made it this far, I'd aim big and hope to remake WoW+, learning from Vanilla design and experience.
---
Classic hasn't even finished and we're already talking about what's beyond? Because if this is due to nostalgia running out, we're gonna need classic+
---
Not as broken as they were in Cata.  Cata is when they introduced spirit link totem, which I used with lust and spiritwalker's grace to brute force that panther boss in ZG that gave pugs so much trouble.  We would burn the boss and at one point all 12 panthers would come out and we would kill the boss before the panthers. My friend the druid tank and I managed ZA bear runs with 1 member of our party actively griefing us by pulling extra mobs when vote kick was on cooldown.  Firelands had the set bonus that made your chain heal not consume riptide so I could absolutely pump.
---
In Dragon Soul the Telluric Currents talent was incredibly broken because it returned mana based on the damage you caused with lightning bolt.  Just about all the bosses in that raid had some kind of increased damage taken mechanic, during which I would fill my entire mana bar with 2-6 lightning bolts.  It was so good that I completely geared out of all spirit and into as much mastery as possible.  On Madness of Deathwing the tentacle hit our druid tank to 1hp and I landed a nature's swiftness greater heal for 800k, which was an absurd number at the time (and his entire health bar).  Basically a Shaman Lay on Hands.  Then when the arm was taking 300% damage i would cast 2 lightning bolts and have full mana.  Those were some fun times.
---
I've been using [this](https://www.vanilla-questing.me/) for a questing guide and can't complain.
---
Can you make bullets anywhere?
---
I saw 100k hp bear on LK 25 Heroic
---
Party frame is symmetrical to the target frame but currently I'm not targeting anything.
---
Umm no that's when all the quest areas open up. Thousand needles, STV, hillsbrad/alterac, desolace, arathi highlands.
---
i am loving this as the druid class, whenever i get to dps instead of tanking you just feel so confident in if the group accidently pulls too many mobs you can assist in tanking them on the spot.
---
I actually feel more useful as cat dps cuz im free to off heal,off tank where as tanking in bearform i cant really leave my form.
---
Honestly it makes me feel bad, but while trying to make money on the AH I always look towards the warrior gear for a quick flip. Any cloth or leather gear you buy has a chance of sitting in your inventory unless you throw out some real good prices. But shields? I can ask for the moon and a warrior will cough up. Think this makes me a bad person, but I never go crazy high or nothing cause I know these guys are necessary down the road
---
100% Classic Expansions here.
---
True.
---
What is the difference between need and greed?
---
A voidwalker couldn't hold aggro covered in buttercream frosting at a body acceptance convention.
---
There are a couple lulls in eastern kingdoms that are very easy to fill in kalimdor though haha
---
But how do you encourage players to run these dungeons with out stat bloat? Soon you'll have people with 50% crit chance with 10k health 300dps weapons essential destorying everyone and everything without t5 gear from emerald dream.
---
Rolled a mage from the start but from lvl 40 I have to aoe instance spam because my server is 70% horde, outnumbered 10 to 1 in every questspot it seems.
---
And he was using a USB steering wheel
---
Pure classic, no resets. 
---
I really honestly have no idea how this community has been asking for it for years, and once the game has been out for less than a month everyones already on the hype wagon to have something else.
---
Would everyone want Classic+ with a graphics update?
---
I don’t mean a zone revamp. I mean a 1-for-1 update to all the environment and models.
---
Otherwise I’m not sure how it would be with some new content looking 15 years newer.
---
Yup.  Am autistic, love factorio.
---
You seem very upset with my preferences friend. Might I suggest you put on a Cat Stevens record, have a nice cup of tea and chill out?
---
To be honest, all I do as a mage is drink. You're either aoe farming or spamming frostbolt, and after every fight you're out of mana. And your mage water is not nearly fast enough, try a full 30 seconds to refill unless evocate is off it's 8 minute cooldown. It's vanilla though, I'm sure every class is just as boring. At least you can port places, that's incredibly helpful. And shatter combos are fun.
---
Hmm i think the one that shows how much you can vendor their loot for, found it on cursedgamingforge
---
for the love of god, just do the expansions and classic server cycles every three years or something. after reading the comments i have no hope left that classic+ could succeed based on feedback. this subreddit is way too large nowadays, stupid people will prevail. i'm baffled that qol dungeon finder implementations are even named, yet alone highly upvoted. people are so fucking lazy nowadays, the game would be ruined harder than in cataclysm.
---
Awesome gif loop too nice one
---
It has different requirements, doesn't it? Or are the graphic settings the same?
---
Agreed, especially with downranked spells for mana conservation.
---
The removal of attunements was done with the pre-wotlk patch wasn't it? Because TBC had really nice attunement progression all the way to Black Temple.
---
Poor guy xd
---
Classic+ seems like The best idea imo. Flying killed wow.
---
Send plenty of arrows through an alt to yourself. Same with food for your pet. You have nearly everywhere access to a mailbox.
---
Crossed my mind honestly, a "nothing comes for free" message, but the moment was too sweet to ruin it.
---
is it confirmed that it's fixed?
---
Should have also casted heal and cancelled many times over
---
_______ and meatballs!
---
Classic with arena /drool
---
Classic + would be awesome. Some kind of "hard mode" dungeons, new talents for more diverses builds...
---
I'd like to see Outland in a "classic way" tho. And sexy blood elfs.
---
And I dream of being back at the point I was at in vanilla last, where 50g didn't matter!  Soon enough....
---
You have no idea how this works. Even Blizzard had no old working of the server, just the binary. Client binaries exist is mass of course but server bunary and source code are not that easy. Also don't forget it's not only the code but depends also,on tools and their version like make, makefile generator, compiler, linker, libraries... This is nearly never completely known or saved after 10 years.
---
Hunter not drinking too l???
---
Private servers didnt work well in the same way as classic wow. Everyone was alwqys jumping on the newest server. How many people did stick around for years after naxx?
---
The discussion about classic+isnt because we want new content now. But we'd like to think what is there after. You might say its too early to talk about and thats a valid argument but i assume that the majority of people who'd like to know is because its an MMO and people like MMOs because they are always evolving games and those people know that they wont stick around after Naxx, not for long at least. I know i wouldnt and if there isn't ever anything new then the whole classic thing will feel like a waste of time for some people. Sure its not really a waste of time if you had a blast but still investing like 100 days /played on a character and then having to leave everything behind because said "MMO" which are supposed to be games with continuous support is not having any support.
---
Nah but you gotta get the dungeon quests aswell.
---
I always like to heal anyone I come across, especially if that saves them from dying.
---
I was here but it was so unenjoyable just lagging out your ass. I was stuck above the flight master for 30 seconds and couldn't move after I landed
---
TBC!! Classic+ would most likely not feel like classic.
---
I didn't really like TBC. But that's probably just me. Never really felt like home. It's also when I lost interest in WoW.
---
Perfect for blacklisting people. Thanks mate, this was what I was searching for
---
Would be interesting to have a divergent story line while keeping the classic experience for sure. I love wow but for some reason after playing classic, retail doesnt feel as exciting :/
---
I would like to see old ideas and content for vanilla that never made it into the game be added to classic servers. But no matter what Blizz decides to do I hope they will leave some servers without any changes from the original experience for those that want to keep Classic as it was back in the day, if that would be possible.
---
They should leave Classic alone so it’s always there for us to play. Hopefully they’ll add servers for TBC and Wrath too. 
---
If they do make a Classic+ it should copy your Classic character and allow you to continue as them, without changing the original on Classic servers. 
---
Did that make sense?
---
That way any hunter weapon can be good. I mean seriously. I am commenting that some of the bows and guns are good on warriors and rogues too but you wouldnt think they roll before a hunter right? since, as i said it is a bigger upgrade for hunters?
---
How selfish can you guys be? I had a hunter take robe of arugal from our groups priest because it is good on him as well...
---
Wlll, when I leveled in a wow vanilla server, not long before tbc, I had hard time finding peoples to dungeons with, most peoples were lvl60. In addition to that, I had no idea a looking for group channel existed. It was not friendly to noobs. I think something in between, could be good. As even looking for group might become flooded.
---
Maybe a lobby, like overwatch group finding. And no teleport to instance, patience is a virtue  : ).
---
Wheres my thrall bodypillow ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

A significant number of outspoken people in /1 - following with the same line of accusations like kingcal's or Chiffa37's posts in this thread.
---
Trolls can't even get pissed off without using mana
---
You think art doesnt have a deadline?
---
As long as its not another gear treadmill, with power creep
---
Just depends how efficient you are and getting the dungeon quests at red completed grants tones of xp
---
Classic + or/and TBC/WotLK with ability to transfer my character to new expansion.
---
Those % are based on how hard it is for something of the same lvl to hit you, with things lower lvl having a harder time hitting and things higher lvl having an easier time.
---
I'd really like to see the entire world filled out (Classic+)
---
The dark portal/Outlands could be a new BG or raid instance.
---
SPOILER:

how many of you knows that she is actually Onyxia in human form standing near Anduin the whole time

i think the TBC - Wrath era was peak, Wrath felt very epic. Post Wrath felt a little convoluted (i didnt stop until end of MOP tho)
---
Classic+. I love and think wrath was the best expansion, but all info, like classic, is already out there.
---
Classic+ would be Awsome since we would get content that is actually new and unknown to us
---
You will be able to play, but only with characters lvl20 and below.
---
maybe its you
---
Classic + with updated models/environments and a few additions from the other WoW; barber, achievements (specifically tailored to Classic), additional festivals, etc. 
---
I’d love to see Classic branch away and became its own game. I’ve had zero interest in subbing for years now but here I am,  back and loving the pace, difficulty and community that is Classic.
---
You're being disingenuous with your first point so I won't bother reading the rest, I clearly gave my reasons for why it's a good thing and didn't just say "if you don't like it, quit!" like you suggested. Using psychological tricks like compulsion and addiction to get people to keep playing rather than having them want to play because of great updates and a fun, immersive world is why WotLK flatlined and WoW started going downhill and in my opinion it's also scummy and evil. You're free to disagree of course.
---
Even more annoying when another mage does that. Hnnnng.
---
Seems to work with all sorts of attacks. My human paladin was having fun with a double pelvic thrust into seal of command jump followed by a pirouette

Yeah the start of the WoW launch user base were “hardcore” (kind of hard not to be) MMO players from Everquest, Runescape, and Ultima Online. With retrospectively difficult gameplay, heavy grinding, clunky UI, and open-ended questing and leveling, these games created a type of player that was ready for every challenge that WoW had to offer. They were used to vague NPC directions (remember Morrowind?), exploring zones, pouring over maps, and asking for and giving help to fellow players.  
---
As the WoW hype bled like an Eviscerate into mainstream gaming, literal millions of new players to the genre got to play and love the game, but not as the next evolution in their own MMO career, but as their own new experience. With that came their own perceptions and opinions on how the game should evolve, and these differed strongly with those of the Old Guard, so to speak.  
---
Long winded, I know. I guess the short of what I’m getting at is different players want different things. I think WoW was so good at what they did for so long, it stifled competition. Where in other genres, you had so many different games and publishers that would resonate differently with players, MMOs have been under WoW’s massive shadow for so long that everything else died before it could really take off.  
---
I’m not sure which route would be best, TBH. Right now I’m really happy with playing Classic. The magic is back, baby!
---
I don't think people will stop doing the earlier raids for a LONG time. Think about how long it takes to hit 60 for most people... Then consider that most people, once they've maxed out a character with the best raid gear will probably roll an alt... Personally, I don't think I could get bored of MC, Ony and BWL lol I love those raids. 
---
As long as the new content is horizontal progression and is implemented in the same way as the other content I.e It doesn't detract from community interaction, we should be fine. 
---
But besides that, we have a LONG way to go before classic+ is even considered. And it may not even happen.
---
Absolutely did.  It just meant everything was geared toward stam/health.  It was somewhere around 22-23k unbuffed.
---
I mean, yeah that's why I wrote it and just check some of the replies, people seem to agree.
---
Yea, some are pure bull.
---
You sir are a kind person even captain placeholder will be proud
---
It's sad that cataclysm gets such a bad rap as a whole. First tier of Cata PvE was actually legit as heck.
---
Then Firelands released without it's water counterpart and Dragon Soul was horribad.
---
Delet dis!!!
---
Yes they did, I agree they were great at the start but they removed them during TBC and that was the last we saw of them.
---
It's where we send all the people that keep posting about what they want to happen "after Classic".
---
As a horde shaman, I died maybe 4-5 times during my whole Barrens run. As an alliance warrior, I died over a dozen times in Loch Modan.
---
Levels 10 to 20 are a real pain in the ass.
---
Maybe but that is not how I remember it. I played some slow paced games and also unreal tournament and 12 year old me didn‘t notice any such issues.
---

---
That's really pathetic of them. As a lock, I know certain spells don't tick immediately. If I want a quick tag, I wand it. Mobs have been stolen from me, but I just move on, because I could have tagged it faster.
---
what ? dungeons is  by far best xp, questing is only great when you know what to do and what to avoid, otherwise even grinding beats questing ...
---
..Why were you flagged in Silverpine?
---
That set bonus is lol though
---
Pvp in wow has never really been balanced,world pvp and the original alterac valley were epic and fun
---
I dont get this. If you actually played vanilla, there is no chance in hell you "forget" about the Braziers.
---
Sure, I dont remember small things. The path in WC for example, or how to do certain quests. I was also very young when I played vanilla in 06, but things like the Braziers, you dont just forget.
---
Does this mean that mobs also have to walk back to their corpses?
---
You literally spam 1 ability on many classes, it comes down to what class and gear
---
I love the new ones, like Uldum (and yes, like Vash'jir, despite not getting a huge underwater main city as I had hoped for), but I really disliked what they did to the existing zones with Cata. They should have left those alone.
---
Well, no problem for testing.
---
Alright, thank you Jaime fucking Lannister!
---
I don’t agree with you just because of the ease of the raids. Outside of ICC it just wasn’t hard to progress through. If they released WOTLK with Naxx and TOC being real raids I’d be fine with it
---
Prequel expansions
---
Start new expansion characters at level -9, play through new (prequel) content until level 1, continue with 1-60 in mostly old content. Level 1-9 battlegrounds.
---
Perhaps stats picking instead of talents, giving a chance to reach different level 1 stats than classic. Maybe minor/cosmetic changes to races/classes achievable.
---
Next expansion: level -19 to -9 content..
---
 Hello all, I am a proper tryhard player who likes to minmax, I plan to pvp as a hunter. Which proffesions would you reccomend while levling my first hunter character and why? Also when i reach 60 I heard engineering is very good, but what other proffession should i get with it that would benifit me in pvp? thank you all in advance for your answers
---
The safe path is to go BC and WotLK and Blizz would prefer that as it is the cheapest route.
---
I would love to see Classic+, but it is extremely risky because the possibility of ending up with an expansion that is retail/classic mess (that both camps would hate) is huge.
---
Isnt 1.12 after pet normalization?
---
Lol, experienced that on private server, but thought that bullshit gear lock was only on private server, especially due to missing raids not scripted.
---
As a rogue, let me tell you that even playing fields are for suckers.
---
One day. Good story haha
---
Classic+ pls
---
option 4: none of the above.
---
Why.... WHY do these illiterate shits feel the need to add the word 'like' to the end of 'how it feels...'?!
---
i want classic+ tbh, an alternate timeline where WoW dont turn into a shitshow would be amazing
---
Classic + or expansions. I'm not even 30 yet, but I feel people will be burned out very quickly running the same raids over and over for nothing. We need the honor system already. The idea of Classic + is neat and I honestly would want that over expansions, if + was done correctly.
---
Listening to the playerbase is what got us retail game design, it has to be the worst thing you can do for a game like classic.
---
Throw it on your next alt :p
---
He rolls flagged like the TRUE HORDE!!!
---
Feel always free to report any issues you experience to us. We're trying our best with the few people we have to create a nice and helpful addon.
---
Its a mistake if it is brought in. We this is classic not tbc.
---
Engineering makes bullets yes
---
Get a life dude im am only lvl 21
---
Keep saying it
---
For me, I would love to see classic plus. I always imagine Northrend being the content first instead of BC though because of Naxx at the end of vanilla. I would love to see Northrend turned into a giant AQ event where we fight through each zone and unlock the different raids and dungeons as we progress through the continent.
---
But i also want to see the unfinished things like Hyjal too, so much content that they could add in to classic to make classic+ a thing and hopefully a good thing.
---
The key to classic plus though is that there must not be any additional levels, everything has to stay relevant.
---
Lol at people voting for Classic+. I think it's generally the popular opinion here is that Blizzard hasn't been doing a great job with the game lately, yet they trust them to make great new Classic content. Releasing TBC is the safer option by far. A whole new expansion will offer exponentially more (and probably better) content than slow, player-voted stuff that'll undoubtedly be released very sparsely.
---
It's fun! For me, these interactions with other players are what really make the game. Despite the fact that I made literally no progress for over an hour, I was having a blast!
---
For the Alliance!!!
---
We shall burn Teldrassil to the ground one day brother.
---
Is that like BIS or something?
---
Okay so you are saying the enhancement guy has to leave? I mean that is a bullshit attitude right there? Why dont you assume the rogue leaves? 
---
Also just because someone plays a different spec doesnt mean they dont put the effort in? 
---
I mean in your guild it is obviously your decision and by all means i understand gearing rogues etc first. I am just saying that i believe that just because someone decided to raid as enh or ele or balance does NOT mean they dont put effort in and dont try. I would say as long as they are prepared, potted, got their pre raid items and you can see they are active etc i just dont see why they shouldnt join the raids? 
---
And if you are struggling to kill the boss that you only need rogues and mages then hmm id say you got other problems.
---
Yep, brilliant game :)
---
Classic+ I'd vote for.
---
True Classic with resets would never happen, imagine the uproar and every cycle would see less players. 
---
I was 'downvoted' for this in a post but I still think will happen is Classic+ (classic/vanilla with new content, new raids or as you described it, but not the QOL nonsense we saw after WOTLK) AND the expansions will exist where you can copy your character over from classic Wow. But this will not destroy the original. I don't think they would go past WOTLK, so there would be 3 classic iterations that coexist. Anything more than that and it gets too messy, would already be quite messy as is, but the demand is probably there. I'd wait a few years for this though and just concentrate on Classic Wow for now with 60 as strict, eternal level cap.
---
I have a 31 druid, 28 hunter, and 20 warrior. Funny to have similar classes the same levels as someone else. 
---
But I recommend druid. The can-do-everything of the class really got me. I tank most dungeons because it lets me get groups quickly, but heal now and again. No downtime while soloing because cat form into heals. Entangling roots is amazing for PVP, either letting me run away or letting me kill a runner (not that travel form let's them get far). People love getting my buffs when I'm out an about. Saved quite a few people with heals or tanking a mob for them. The battle res is useful in dungeons but can feel bad out in the world since it has a long cool down, but I've still ressed a few random strangers when the unfortunate happens.
---
Mostly I just really like the pure utility of the class and the amount of flexibility it has in every environment.
---
Feel free to report issues you experience to us. We're trying our best with the few people we have to create a nice and helpful addon.
---
Quest reward XP is the same no matter if its green, yellow or red. Red mobs actually give a penalty in XP as well but it's hard to notice as higher level mobs give more base XP for killing.
---
I think most people just run up to mobs and sinister strike, which is not that interesting as a crit.
---
I personally put my first two points in there, when leveling as dagger rogue. Combined with the sub talent you are pretty much guaranteed to crit ambush.
---
Maybe
---
I still do that too, but a client has the convenience of automatically updating addons when there's a new version of it
---
I'm getting "A supported game is required to use this feature". Any idea what could be going on?
---
If you look at OSRS they made separate dev team for it. Maybe Classic + could gain a 10/20 dollar price tag to justify bringing on a separate dev team.
---
I'd like to assume they'd always keep a time capsule of it as is now, sure, but back then I wanted them to finish stuff, flesh out unfinished classes, and new stuff to do. Hell, even retail doesn't have a lot of the things I wanted in vanilla and am re-wanting now.
---
The game is great but it ain't perfect, I welcome the future.
---
Classic+ !
---
I think the best is to let people experience the complete time line again but in a condensed ver, like instead of a year to go next xpac do it in every 6 month. 
---
Although it should be fine to make changes to the game as it goes since they allow modern addons so it's not like vanilla wow anyway...
---
However, maybe no change would still be better bcus they prob don't have a good dev team that can guarantee improvement in PvP n PvE for prev xpacs
---
Either way, splitting into many diff xpacs will cut population too much n might not feel alive anymore so should just stick with one decision for the whole community imo
---
Just what i fear as well. I would love for a classic+ being basicall a reboot or retry in a different spirit. But voteable content will quickly degrade the game into a state worse than retail imho.
---
I've been grinding SM all week as a warrior tank. I have frequently made the tactical decision to let a rogue or an arms just eat a mob for a few seconds, or even most of a pull. They don't take that much more damage at this level and it keeps everything lumped together.
---
Btw mind control doesn't work on ships in wow classic
---
Honestly the Caverns of Time is a really easy thing to use as an excuse to provide all sorts of Dungeons to run
---
I started LFG for Gnomeregan at 19:00 Last night we finished at 23:30.
---
It was worth it though, I got 7! upgrades.
---
Im an aspiring warrior player if theirs any macros you could share id appreciate it lol
---
Thank you. Maybe i should try one :)
---
I dreamed about Hyjal being a playabke Zone for so long. I saw the exploits in this area and with a few weeks of dev they could form an entirely new experience.
---
Also with the Twilight Highlands or Elwynn Mountains behind Stormwind this could be very nice.
---
That's what I was missing the most honestly - side activities that don't feel like a waste of time.
---
Generally, I find my perception of time is so much.. healthier in Classic. There are no dailies, so if I don't feel like playing on a given day, I don't feel bad about it. And when I do want to play, maybe I'll spend the day fishing or something, and I won't feel bad about not levelling since it's still gonna take forever either way.
---
It's just such a nice experience all around.
---
Faster learning of weapon/armor skills is a thing though, I'm sure mana-less classes will be happy too!
---
I would say the difference between a Hub city and a "Main town" is that both factions can be there peacefully and there are often a lot of things associated with it - it's where you get your "daily quests", all your profession trainers, there's too many convenience features such as portals to every other "Main town", it reduces the world down to a convenient hub rather than just being a major place.
---
Hey man, if you had fun, it ain't wasted time :) I'm using phase 1 just to explore and screw around. Nothing worth hitting level cap for right now anyway, and MC+Ony can always be done later on. 
---
Spent 7 hours on the paladin class quest to get Verigans Fist (weapon) and had an absolute blast. Travelled the map, met some really cool people, did 3 different dungeons etc etc etc. Good times :D
---
If Blizzard ever would acknowledge classic as a success. I don't see why it wouldn't work having both true classic, and classic+ for those who wants it.
---
About 99% of people in this thread. It's been 15 years you know !
---
Some people just enjoy the competition I'd assume and some people just love speed running.  This is what I like about classic, everyone is playing it their way and enjoying it instead of playing because we have to.
---
I agree, I loved TBC too but I don't think it should be the basis for any "fresh" content
---
Mop
---
OS X (Mac OS 10) version (software fork) mostly crashes (quit without a warning) when you write (pressing keyboard buttons) special characters (characters that are not in US keyboard) like ö ü ş ğ c. Didn't try it without addons (addons might make game crash, manipulating under the hood)
---
I wouldn't want them to add Outland at all.
---
Outland, even without new levels, movenpeople away from azeroth, pretty much completely killing the original world.
---
It is the same issue that has plagued wow all the time since they always add new areas, instead of expanding upon existing areas.
---
Tbc has stuff that was on azeroth that we can get though. Karazhan, caverns of time along with mount hyjal (present and past version for the caverns of time raid), ghostlands and silvermoon could be added, but as a neutral area, because I do not want blood elves nor space goats flr either faction.
---
Because when most people last played vanilla the idea of spamming dungeons wasn’t as popular as this time around and open world questing for warriors is slow at best, at least compared to the other classes because of a reliance on gear and an understanding of game mechanics.
---
When making any list there’s gonna be something in first, and something in last, the trick is understanding what the actual difference is besides their place on a list of “lvling speed”.
---
No, you were doing textbook warrior tanking. So was I. Now everyone else has to learn to do it that way too.
---
I remember doing tons and tons and tons of wpvp at the Nagrand Arena waiting for my arena queue to pop. I remember Isle of Quel’thelas being a constant PvP battlefield.
---
Classic+ with polling.
---
Which UI addon is that?
---
One thing that fixed my lag completely was going into system settings in game, network, and turning off 'optimize network for speed', maybe give that a try?
---
oh ok, thanks for clarification
---
my progress started slowing down dramatically near 40... turns out i'm having plenty of fun running low levels through dungeons and helping with quests, because it helps others enjoy the game and that's the most fun you can have.
---
In other news, domestic GDP took an unexplained downturn in the third quarter. Economists are puzzled.
---
Rets make shit healers, dont even compare the difference
---
I realize that this is an unpopular opinion, but you didn't really answer why it's childish... Aoeing with 4 mages is fun just like taking it chill with a diverse group of dps and a tank is also fun, why hate on one play style
---
Well the good news is that restarting my at 20 isn't that bad, you're really only about 10% of the way to 60. Even if you run through every class before picking a main, 20 is a goodish point to  start feeling things out
---
"...just do mage things"
---
Rofl
---
Nah man, hunters miss left and right. Personally, it’s funny to me when I pull a mob away from others, and the shot I used to aggro is a big, fat whiff 🙌👎🏼
---
The issue (which I get and, to an extent, agree with) is that it got rid of server communities. Before, you actually had to talk to people, instead of just letting an algorithm match you. And cross-server stuff destroyed any sense of "oh that guy's a good tank, I've run WC with him before."
---
exactly
---
Not there yet. Lots of grinding to do still.
---
you got it all wrong mate, frostbite is the BEST for aoe dungeons, blizzard rank for frostbite, flamestrike coc and AE. Its the opposite, your spec is best for dungeons and sucks for single play aoeing.
---
There is no way to get what your'e asking without it f*cking up classic. It really wont be classic anymore. At the very least it will put everyone on a gear treadmill again, then comes power creep -&gt; heading towards retail which would ruin the "classic" in classic wow even if done well.
---
I dont mean this in a sarcastic way, but if more content is needed for people after classic, why not go to Retail where there are years of content, or another private server with an expansion or two?
---
My point is just that you cant get to keep the good classic wow AND get a bunch of new shit at a high pace like on retail. Its one or the other in the end.
---
That isn't certain. The leads behind classic said on the classicast that nothings been decided and they like all ideas, classic+, tbc classic etc
---
Number 3, but I would also like Achievements for Classic servers. I think that would make a lot of content without really changing anything.
---
Gorgeous as always. Just ran this dungeon a couple of days ago and forgot how fucking cool all the mirages (nightmare creatures?) were. Made me go from dreading the run to doing it another couple of times for fun.
---
Looool, and just dinged 30 last night.. And i have 60h already, i know i'm not the most efficient player 😂 Honestly i was thinking of rolling a hunter, but first i will get my rogue to 60.
---
That is why we play games - in the game you can try something you would never dare to do irl
---
ah i see, thank you.
---
&gt; You're being disingenuous with your first point so I won't bother reading the rest,
---
I suspect that this is no loss to me whatsoever.
---
&gt; Using psychological tricks like compulsion and addiction to get people to keep playing rather than having them want to play because of great updates and a fun, immersive world is why WotLK flatlined and WoW started going downhill and in my opinion it's also scummy and evil. You're free to disagree of course.
---
On a scale of evil, arena seasons are someone crackling their crisp packet in a theatre and vanilla's honour system is Adolf Hitler.
---
Flying makes it shit, outlands make it shit and dungeon finder makes it shit.
---
Mix of Classic + and Classic expansions. Keep flying and lfg out of the game, make new content and mix in first few expansions content into brand new expansions. They may have to redesign zones designed with flying in mind. 
---
Sounds tough, but really if they keep flying and lfg away, the game can progress all over again.
---
 Those asking for #nochanges are a rather small part of the population currently playing the game, and a small part of who will keep playing it (this will get me down voted massively). There was enough of them to bring the game back, but I don't think there is enough of them to keep it going, with the existing number of servers, they'd have to merge servers heavily over time.
---
I am not one of the #nochanges crowd, however I understand why they want it to not change. Classic brought me back after playing from mid-late vanilla to cataclysm. I imagine I can get a good 3 months of very heavy play time out of this, and another 9 months of split game time, after that point I doubt I can justify the subscription (as retail holds no interest for me) and I doubt I will be alone.
---
I was once like you, less than a week ago, I would have gone out of my way to /wave or assist an alliance. 
---
Now, due to the actions of the few, I will grow to destroy as many Alliance as possible. 
---
"Hate begets hate, violence begets violence".
---
Youre crazy if you trust modern blizzard to make classic style content and not totally shit the bed. Look what they've done to the franchise
---
I'm playing mage, I checked how aoe farming works and honestly it doesn't appeal to me. I'm prefer questing and killing mobs one by one, or maybe an aoe here and there.
---
Although, I'm only level 24 right now and I can't wait to get shatter 5/5. Right now killing a mob of equal level takes 7ish frost bolts if it doesn't crit, it's really slow ttk.
---
I also got a rogue to 22 and its feels much better in pve, its smooth, it just plays better. But in the end I really enjoy mage's class fantasy and all the animations, I'll stick to it and hoping with shatter it will get much better.
---
Certainly we don't know what else they might decide to do. But we know they are going to do burning Crusade at least.
---
I'm the same. Started out as a druid, got to 20 and it was quite fun but man warlock looks pretty sweet. Got to 14, man hunter looks easy so I got myself to 19 and now I wanna heal.   
---
So I go Shaman, got to 20 and started over as a priest, got to 6 and I think I am finally done with choosing my class, I will roll a rogue when I get back home.
---
 Too much walking. 20-30 zone means there may be just a couple of quests for 20 level and other are for 25+, so you just move over the same zones again and again.
---
Had a situation yesterday where a warrior asked for one because he wanted to skill his weapon faster... You never know who might want int.
---
Balls deep
---
To be honest I missed it.  The bigger health pools were a quick way to identify the tanks.  Was also helpful for spotting someone who was under geared.
---
I remember doing one of the early cata dungeons with my partner.  I was healing but was max level and overgeared (was helping partner with one of his alts).  Anyway, Tank seemed rediculously squishy (impossible to heal level of squishy).  Checked out his gear after he got squashed by trash a few times.  He still had gear from burning crusade on and I am not talking raid gear.
---
He was able to hide it with the start rework.
---
Mage is very strong and S Tier in the right hands in pvp...
---
I was half way through a dungeon with a dickhead paladin and told him to go fuck himself and hearthed out. Felt pretty good. Some people can't be dealt with in reasonable terms.
---
WOW dude, you just killed an AFK player, I'm sooo impressed! Horde in a nutshell... pathetic
---
My main is a warlock so mama is not much of an issue.
---
But I recently rolled a mage alt, I now have a new found respect for mages.
---
Option 4. They release the rest of the expansions but actually make them better. So for the bc they would for example improve the story so it doesnt feel like we killed illidan for no reason. for wrath they would not introduce lfg.things like that.and hopefuly in 10 years we will be at a point where the foundation is much better than it is now and they scrap the shitty expansions like wod and bfa for better ones
---
Try to look for people for the dungeons inside your guild first before you Look elsewhere
---
I have that icon too. My installed addons are;
---
auctiondb, bagbrother, bagnon, bettervendorprice, classiccastbar, leatrixmaps, questie, tomtom.
---
I guess it's bettervendorprice or bag things.
---
If they see thst they are making money from subs on it though, it won't be a quick cash grab as a lot of cynical people think it is.
---
Completely agree with this. BC and WOTLK class mechanics, no flying mounts, no arenas. Make people go out to explore world and fight there. It is WARcraft after all.  
---
Also, remove that stupid debuff limit on bosses, make other specs viable too. I would throw tons of money on this.
---
Well leveling Mage - unless you are AOE farming or Spellcleaving. 
---
Is pretty much only Frostbolt.
---
Like hunter where you send your pet and Auto attack. As mage you would just press 1 button.
---
I liked it though. I Level a Hunter and a Mage on private Servers before.
---
I would say mage is more fun in PVP later on. Hunter is the better solo class.
---
You choose :)
---
AOEing can be just as fun as questing in my opinion. Figuring out how much your group can pull and which tactics has been pretty fun so far. Every group I'm a part of seems to do it differently as well.
---
I would want classic+. Resetting servers and progress seems like a horrible idea to me. But how about we get some honor system and pvp going first? xD 
---
Is there any word on when this comes?
---
I mean if you want to clear dungeons efficiently the tank should be pulling mid drink 🤷‍♂️
---
Dungeon grinding is all about reducing downtime
---
(Not that guy)
---
Honestly the majority of the popular ones. D&amp;D3.5 to 5E shows a dramatic cut down on tables, stats and rolls, trying to streamline the flow of combat. Pathfinder 2E is a good take on it too, though it opts for being more open to adding stats and values to track though.
---
There is a big surge in narrative focused games with relatively light stats though.
---
It's not for everyone though, a lot of the scene really enjoys the more crunchy stat-heavy systems. Pathfinder 2E saw a lot of the 1E crowd staying using 1E despite the end of its development and content production.
---
Happened to me as well.
---
so i've been playing wow since really early bc and classic has given me the experience of viewing classic with an adult brain which is awesome. I am also quite a big player of OSRS and have been ever since its realise. I think classic+ would be a really good idea as long as they tackle it in the same way OSRS do in that the community vote to decide on future content. i would also be up for the classic expansions as long as it has branches and you could log into either your classic, BC, WOTLK accounts and the charters be separate or carried over from the last expansion.
---
AoE was always the way until they nerfed the piss out of it in early Wrath. That's why spellcleave dungeons are so successful. Classic and TBC have the same linear damage increase for AOE spells that became so prominent in Naxx trash.
---
if you spend enough time doing darkshore, you start to notice you can complete large chunks of quests in a kind of circle going around the zone, and that speeds up leveling there massively.
---
I just wish the devs made this more clear, because it's not super obvious that you can play that way, and it's easy to just end up wandering in random directions to hit up quests.
---
Unless they fixed it at current patch, in vanilla you could /dance and autoattack mobs at the same time.
---
Sometimes it created some laughs depending on weapons and which dance.
---
2v2 3v3 5v5 arenas in classic is what I want to see.
---
As a soon to-be undead rogue, I will gank every gnome I see.
---
&gt;but for rest there will be a future, good or bad
---
Do you mean they confirmed new content beyond the phases?
---
Im out of the loop.
---
I'd love to see burning crusade come back just for the sake of raising kara again plus healing with shaman.
---
I've been pretty lucky. Most people have had good etiquette.
---
For sure classic+
---
One Hundred Fucking Percent agree that Dailies proved themselves to be the start of the decline. 
---
None of us saw it at the time, we didn't know how bad it would get, but when Blizzard starting trying to puppet-master people into continuing to log in every day by dangling carrots and gating progression artificially to drag out sub time, instead of just creating fun and engaging progression that made us WANT to log in every day, it was the beginning of the decline into over-analyzed market-driven design that lost the soul of what made the game engaging in the first place.
---
No new classes please. Its hard enough to balance around the 9 classes currently in classic. Theyd make IT infinetily harder for themselves
---
I mean it's all personal preference but sure whatever you say.
---
Yeah but it was _fun_. And clearly some ret pallies were better than others as there was always a dps difference so there was something to it. And it was a little more than just 3 spells, it was like 5 lol but how you geared etc made a difference. Plus you still had a decent amount of utility and I had gear for all 3 specs and switched my off spec around depending on need. I killed the LK as all 3 specs.
---
But honestly it was just such a powerful cleave that smashing huge groups of mobs in raids and watching all the numbers fly up everywhere was awesome to me. Cata Ret pally felt so boring in comparison.
---
I know. I wanted a macro that targets a dif party member and cast int on him/her each time. 
---
So 1 click (macro) target party member 1 - buff int.
---
2nd click target party member 2 - buff int
---
Etc etc
---
how do you travel between those?
---
my research shows that either tram (The Deeprun Tram: Ironforge, Dun Morogh to Stormwind, Elwynn Forest) or by flying but the later requires to get to dun morogh first, is it correct?
---
Thrusting the Spear etc. All the sons of Hodir dailies had lewd titles.
---
That‘s what I‘m doing
---
Make the old raids scalable for 5 player groups when new content drops. People can still run it the "normal" way if they want or use it to catch up in the 5 man group version. They have to run the content to get to endgame but it would be way easier finding 4 dudes than 39 for an "old" raid.
---
Early BC Heroics could be pretty savage, the hellfire peninsula heroics like blood furnace and shadow labs had crazy damage.
---
Classic+ with a vote system for changes like OSRS.
---
There's a few ways to go about it; basically you can clean a zone out (until quests and mobs are gray, at which point it's not worth doing the quests since they're way too low level for you), or you can hop zones to the next bracket and do some quests there. Later on you'll find that some zones will give a few lower level quests then you might have to hop to another to get some done before you can comfortably do the next quests in the zone.
---
None. Classic without any resets or new content.
---
All but 3 sound garbage.
---
Classic plus for sure. If done like OSRS this game could get epic AF.
---
i play a mage, and im sure 40% of my /played is just drinking mana
---
TBH Lv.55 might as well be considered the true 60 ding, because that's when you tend to start runing a lot of dungeons for pre-raid BiS (i.e doing content you'll be doing at 60). 30-40 was however the most tedious bracket to go through due to there not really existing any good zones to quest in as Horde, but after hitting 40 it has been smooth sailing since!
---
It's pretty limited on who can move where unfortunately.  They just made a few new servers but you have to switch to the exact one in the same region, time zone, and PVP/PVE type.  So basically you can stay in your crowded server or make the gamble and switch to the new empty one.  Heartseeker will undoubtedly get a decent population.  I'm just worried about who it will be since it's specifically accepting transfers from the streamer servers.
---
So go to a pve server. This stuff is literally what pvp is about. If you abandon your faction, it's only natural to be judged for it.
---
Exactly. This is like engine tick manipulation of OSRS. Its always been but no one did it in the past.
---
Nice! Just finished up Gnomer. 1 upgrade... Had fun though.
---
You are talking about enemies, i am talking about party members. And i've seen/read about macros that cast "certain spells" on mouse-over. What's the difference? Have am add-on that shows enemy debuffs and you essentially have the same thing.
---
Why do you hate yourself?
---
i actually love how mages feel in classic, they have a huge ass downtime but when they do have mana they actually feel like a powerful mage that can destroy anything but then 100% garbage once they run out of mana
---
Hear hear my dude. I want to play khara but retuned for level sixty.
---
Why not have Classic+ AND Expansions? Can let people decide themselves. If they prefer vanilla Classic, they can stick around and enjoy Classic+. If they want to move on, they can server transfer their 60 to the TBC servers where they can level them up (permanantly, aka, can't ever take those char back to Classic).
---
I would prefer classic+, but without Outland. Just use the areas that are already available, like Hyjal and so on.
---
Maybe I was off-beat but it seemed like I'd get a few quests from Auberdine, one sending me north and other south. Maybe if I knew which one would have a follow-up in the other direction I could have optimized the running by doing that and then doing the follow-up and the other original quest in the same direction.
---
You really think those 2 names need policing?
---
Just like all popular gaming subreddits after a while. 
---
Can't even open Apex Legends sub anymore, in addition to all the basic crap there's way too much console gameplays that look like elderly people playing on PC.
---
And then someone needs the RFK escort
---
I stopped in wrath as well, replenishment took my class identity away in PvE(Shadow Priest). It was the beginning of the homogenization of classes. The vehicle battleground was true misery and getting exploded constantly by death knights, ret paladins, survival hunters, and warriors was miserable.
---
Nice to hear that you love it!
---
&gt;Those three spells were in constant rotation, and it felt fine.
---
I played Paladin and the rotation was boring and easy. It was fun to play because of how hard you hit though with those 3 spells and exorcism when it procs.
---
Yes but only on an extra realm where u opt in.
---
If you’re alliance there are some in theramore right?
---
are the conditions really as bad as people say?
---
Totally second this. I got invited to a nationality guild and people are much more talkative. I had always had the experience you describe above, but after this invite I was pleasantly suprised. I felt actually welcome when I joined (not just hi welcome). Even though we don’t do much content atm, I feel like this guild is a good fit. I can definitely advise you to look for a guild that feels good, and if it doesn’t, don’t be afraid to skip.
---
I think you're right. There probably isn't enough Alliance searches for the addon to form accurate picture of faction balance.
---
Or are they for mastering the art of edging?
---
Fixing plate with thread and needle since 2004.
---
Yeah. Mages drink very frequently, but at least it's free. Would be awful otherwise.
---
You can buy subs 3 or 6 months at once which gets you a discount
---
Dwarf: small and fat
---
Night Elf: tall and skinny
---
I think that explains it.
---
(I prefer Dwarf Rogues tho!)
---
Woosh
---
Classic + 100%
---
Well it's a frost spell... they are meant to slow things down duuuh.
---
Congratulations! 
---
Did u by any chance play on Feenix private server ? I remember a guild named Scrub Express.
---
Hi. Im levling a hunter like i did 15 years ago. I am pretty sure that i at some time had an addon/macro/trick to change active action bar depentent on the range of my target. As long as it is in shooting range action bar 1 is my mainbar, but as soon as my target enters melee range, the bar autmatically switches to action bar 2, where i have all my melee abilities.
---
Anyone figured out a way to do this smoothly in classic?
---
I tried some action bar addon, which switches to action bar 2 when i press alt, and switches back when i let go of alt, but alt seem to be a stupid button, because when alt is pressed, i cant attack with any abilities, so it seems this key is already someone keybinded, without me managing to change it.
---
Does /run SetCVar("nameplateMaxDistance", "6e1") or whatever distance, like 40e1 for 40 yards still work?
---
Yesterday killed a Tauren warrior and UD priest while traversing a narrow passage between thousand needles and Tanaris, bc I though they were chasing a night elf hunter (as it turned out they weren’t)... I’m not sorry, RET PALA MASTER RACE ✨💪🏻
---
I think Classic should stay just like how it is, for at least 6 months to a year. At least.
---
Any other spells worth keeping at rank 1 for mages? I’m kinda poor
---
idk as a warrior in classic, doing a fight in a dungeon I could go
---
f, m4, s5, 4, 3, 5, q, q, q, q, 2, 3 with some taunts and revenges sprinkled in as needed. If I were dps it'd be similar except z instead of q. 
---
As someone who hasn't played seriously since wotlk, it feels like enough. Especially because I'm only level 29.
---
That raid was a ridiculous. He had like, what, 3 plate classes that were better geared than him, just so nobody would need on his gear? Asmon is a joke.
---
I don’t play on a Mac
---
looking back wrath was pretty bad honestly. It had Ulduar and that's pretty much it. Rehashed Naxx where the bosses are even easier mechanically than the old version, garbage limited attempt raids, dungeon finder which sowed the seeds for lfr are some of the few I can think of off the top of my head.
---
A lot of people say ElvUI but I'd recommend having a look at TukUI.
---
It's a bit cleaner than ElvUI in my opinion but more importantly, it has a far better controller to adjust it just the way you like it.
---
Yeah, default zone level range build around quests is misleading at best. Like, sure, zone can have some X(2-3-4...)0 quests. But those quests 90% are "go to zone X" given in previous questing location. Actually quests are usually are (X0+2) and mobs  are even more varied by levels. So it's normal to go to zone on level (X0+4) and still start with Yellow quests without penalties and not too hard mobs.
---
Not really trajectory, they took a few updates that was agreed upon but the trajectory is completely different
---
I would do  some ragefire or wailing cavern runs, they normally give good ep and you can do the dungeon quests. It can be challenging to find wailing cavern groups with 17, but i you cannot find one, build your own
---
Also read the comment I replied above. O don't want 1 click to buff all party members. Just to cycle throughout the party and buff a different member each time - on said click.
---
Yeah, calling others idiots will totally make your fabricated numbers true ;)
---
&gt;Lets carefully explore the Lich Kings domain
---
If they take the option of placing northrend at the time prior to the WotLK storyline, you'd have sufficient area for doing this. Both factions would be just barely holding some territory, and slowly start exploring into the continent. You could for instance get a faction of non-hostile drakkari trolls to make contact with, you could have early northrend quests deal with the immediate surroundings of the bases at howling fjord or borean tundra.
---
Raid content could be set up for this as well. You're not so much going into Ulduar to kill Yogg'Saron, you're going in to help Brann understand the place. No vehicle fight. You don't down bosses, you just fight them off until you have more info and then have to flee (akin to the halls of reflection 'fight' with the lich king).
---
Not cool. Don't shit on other games, don't shit on other expansions. Just say classic is your favourite and be done with it.
---
Not cool.
---
too tight.
---
I'd love some classic+ and separate servers for TBC+ and WotLK+. I doubt it makes sense financially but that would be the best possible future for me as a fan of both the expansions.
---
Classic+ definitely.
---
For me Naxx was a huge damper on WotLK. I understand that a lot of people never did it in Vanilla, but I was in one of the 120 or so guilds that cleared it back in Vanilla, and I'd spent several hundred hours in that raid before TBC released, so getting a re-release of it in Wrath with hardly any changes made it a real bummer to start the expansion that way. 
---
I would've been fine with like a Naxx 2.0. Update the bosses, add some mechanics, give it a different approach or something, but no.. everything was just copy+pasted from the vanilla version (some changes for 10man like MC crystals on Razuvious). 
---
I do understand their reasoning with "very few people got to see Naxx in all its glory in vanilla", but to me it just felt lazy, like they should've done more with it.
---
For me, I’d like the option to play Classic with current graphics, as much as possible. Gameplay is the same, just a visual lift. Ideally, you could have it as a toggle feature, so you could choose which graphics you wanted. 
---
Other than that, wouldn’t mind the expansion plan on the right, up to a certain point. I like Blood Elves, don’t know if I like anything else about the expansions though.
---
Classic+ is the best idea. I’ve been spitballing this in my head since it launched. Loved previous expansions but they introduced so many bad things, made our hard work irrelevant, and a lot of times made sense. After Kel’thuzad should have been us marching north into the Ghostlands and saving the blood elves and purifying the Ashbringer in the Sunwell.
---
I had this problem tryin to farm princess I’m maraudon. A few hits from her would be fine but if she ever caught me I’d be instantly gibbed.
---
You used to be able to do that during mind control, could give them your vent info in a /me
---
I know. Since you don't have a crash log, your problem might be about your graphic card drivers. Tried tweaking wow settings and reinstalling current graphic drivers?
---
I think the history of private servers and what we’re witnessing right now shows that, yes, people enjoy this game on its merits in a solid state.
---
does anybody know how to write a "thank you" macro? like set it up to where whenever you press it, your character /thanks to the person selected, making it easy to say thank you to people who randomly buff me while im questing
---
I'm leveling a Warrior, hoping to get 60 .. eventually. I'm not really very good at power leveling though. Sometimes I just can't commit to a long session of questing or dungeon running (puppy needs attention, need to work on the side hustle, family invents some fucking chore I have to do right damn now for some reason, etc), and other nights I have sessions like today where instead of getting any menaingful EXP done, I wan around collecting herbs to build up my potion surplus because healing potions and good elixirs are part of how I manage to not fucking die.
---
There is literally no difference....you click part you use spell(buff in this scenario) ...you click enemy you use spell...its the same thing if you would be able to click 5 friendly targets and use one buff (designed to be single target buff) to be used on all of them. Then you would be able to do it with enemies too. Enemy and friendly is difference fkr you not for the game
---
Honestly think that also would be too much. The fact that you can fly fucks with world interaction too much.
---
Exactly. How the hell are people in this thread calling shit as core to WoW gameplay as Warrior stances fluff?
---
Ok so my warrior just hit 28, is being rage starved something I'm gonna have to get used to, or does it ever get better?
---
I've been pondering about these things, but you put my thoughts into words - thanks for that.
---
After getting back this awesome game that I thought was lost due to numerous patches and actions of Deathwing, I really don't see why everyone is rushing ahead of time and want to fix something that's not broken. 
---
Why is it that some people can't live in the present, but feel a constant urge replace it with something else?
---
The first instance of Hard Mode was actually Zul'Aman for the bear mount but I agree that it's a really creative idea. I personally side with vertical progression for classic+ but if there was horizontal progression and alternatives for lower tiers I would hope that they include hard mode/bear mount run type ideas to encourage Naxx geared players to do the content and be rewarded for it.
---
Something I liked about Legion was the Legion legendary effects, I also had some issues with them but the fact some could change your rotation up was quite nice
---
I think they could add a more gradual power creep (a power creep of some sort is inevitable) by keeping stats quite similar on the gear but changing up the set bonuses to be the reason the clear the new content
---
Yeah, except people abused that system and used it in a way it was never intended.
---
People would kick others that they considered undergeared or too low dps (translation they wanted a piss walk run).  These players were not undergeared or lowballing dps, it's just people wanted cake walk dungeons.  Exactly what is happening with the ridiculous elitism expectations in retail now.
---
Thanks for the reply.  
---
Aaah you mean the bad part about dailies is that you can do them only once a day? Yeah that makes sense, would be better if you could just spam it. Same with heroics. Yes, I completely agree that any kind of arbitrary padding is bad. But as long as you could spend 18 hours just mindlessly farming the same thing I don't care if it requires a lot of time :)  
---
Rest is just an agree to disagree thing I guess. I didn't mean to correct you or anything, just wanted to discuss.
---
Those "start at level 30" are misleading AF. F.e. Desolaсe show no available level 30 quests.
---
Badges from dungeons are lazy progression that make the world feel flat, who cares what dungeons we farm we just need 450 badges for some BiS items. Just give the dungeons no lock-out and a reasonable drop rate and if they're overstated for dungeon drops then have a crafting material drop rarely that can be mixed with professions to create this good items.  
---
Time Limited items and events can be done well (Scepter of the Shifting Sands) and are few and far between but in the case of arena it's limited in a "play forever" kind of way. Every season you come back for new gear sets and a chance at a mount/title that goes away. This isn't a grind you can ever beat, you're in it forever.  
---
Daily Quests/Dungeons are a psychological tool used to try manipulate people into logging on every day to complete some mundane task and keep player retention up. Instead of thinking "I'm looking forward to playing WoW tonight maybe I'll go do some dungeons or hope no ones at X farming so I can make some gold there" you logon and start thinking "I guess I'd better do my dailies.. and daily heroic.." it becomes a routine chore instead of something you look forward to. Over time it actually gets worse because it's required for things like enchants or just too much gold to ignore. It also has a negative effect on the economy by handing out so much free gold which for most players removes any incentive to go out in the world and earn money for repairs or consumables that you might need, instead of finding your own niche spot in the world to farm or fighting over the more popular spots you just do the same daily routine over and over again.
---
Sure love
---
/thank
---
i remember back in the days, stv was one big battleground. It was pratically impossible to quest normally. Every day, after u start doing a quest, u ended up ganking or get ganked stv nesingwary camp.
---
ally vs horde thing is a huge part of the game. Way bigger now than in retail.
---
I'd go with classic+ potentially followed by classic expansions
---
horde are really brutal and overpopulated on my server but some of the PvP battles I’ve had are my favourite moments in game
---
**Multi track buffing!**
---
*\*DÉJÀ VU INTENSIFIES\**
---
I think being strictly limited to 2005 technology would help a lot.
---
My guild is pretty much the same. If players are in the same level range for a dungeon (including alts), they form a group. If not, they run with a pug.
---
I think that's normal because everyone has their own leveling pace and speed. I'm willing to help, but sometimes I have better things to do. Sometimes I don't see the need to help (for example I don't pull low levels through a dungeon when the lfg-channel is full of other players looking for the same dungeon). I ask for help when I need it, but I am not mad if nobody can/want to help.

Getting error message. Doesn't share error message. Expects people on reddit to fix the problem without providing relevant information.
---
Well since OP didn't make a poll, i decided i'd make one if anyone wants to actually vote.
---
[https://www.strawpoll.me/18633872](https://www.strawpoll.me/18633872)
---
My opinion? I would say classic+ but knowing blizzard i feel like i wouldn't be able to trust them for quite some time, i feel like they've broken my trust too much with retail so obviously them adding new content, even if theoretically in the same "concept" as classic would make me worry, so for right now i would say just keep it vanilla.
---
Else it will die leaving only the most hardcore enthusiasts. OSRS was released without nearly any endgame content. You need careful steps of progression. They could release it slowly and tie the missing threads up nicely.
---
I still kind of want to do some indie game dev but I'm not currently, I grew up playing Warcraft 2. I only started playing WoW immediately after finishing my degree... maybe that was my mistake.
---
Absence of dungeon finder forces you to use the social aspect of the game. I had a guild / friends list full of people I ran dungeons with in TBC as a necessary alternative to spamming trade chat for hours to find somebody who doesn't know how to play his class. If that random player turns out to be a nice guy, good at his role, or maybe my other buddy ran heroic shadow labs with him last week, then we add each other - our server got a bit smaller, and it's easier to find a group next time.
---
Lets make it classic+ there is so much room for content that Blizzard can use to make something new for us.
---
To be fair, there was almost no teleporting in TBC dungeons and raids, and a lot of them required significant effort, a good party and time.
---
Talking about in-dungeon teleports, the only ones I can think of is Mount Hyjal, and Black Temple (right?).
---
But I agree with you - Vanilla dungeons are very good.
---
fuck that i want my netherwing drake
---
Playing paladin for the first time and loving it. Bit confused about the seals though (only have 2 atm as I’m level 10). Is one objectively better than he other? Should I be alternating them during a fight? Or do I just use the one that most recently got it’s second rank? Can’t remember their names but I think one is righteousness. Thanks!
---
It was easy, but I wasn’t bored with it. It was a reactive rotation. You put priority on the move that fit your situation and went through the rotation. The system it was replaced with had more buttons and an added resource, but it took away the reactive element. It was more complex, but more repetitive.
---
I'm just glad this crunch issue is being brought up to the surface. I hope conditions start improving now that more people are aware.
---
One problem that arises with 15% increase (even though I agree that is's a good power increase) is that it quickly gets out of hand since it's not calculated as an additive but instead multiplicative. So after 4 Tiers after Naxx we would be \~75% stronger than Naxx since it's 1.15\^4 = 1.749, and Naxx is already a decent power level over the other raids in Classic.   
---
Now I realize that this is a must for new content to be interesting but there is a vocal part of this community that hates that idea.
---
1500dps as shadow priest in tbc made you a godly mana battery iirc.
---
Wotlk got hyper inflated because hard modes (initially they were bragging rights only, loot was added late in the dev cycle) and to a lesser extent 10/25 man split.
---
It wouldn't be classic if it isn't the original classic.

Get in the habit of standing in your flair with an ice trap at your feet before you pull mobs if you think a rogue is in the area.

Blizzard destroying the competition by making their developers addicted to Classic.
---
The key to hunter solo leveling is a second monitor with something to watch. You can make a macro with pet attack, hunters mark and auto shot and bind that on a mouse button. All you need. Playable with one hand and still faster than most other classes.
---
If you play mage you constantly have to actively play and then drink. Not exactly exciting to sit there and wait for 30 sec.
---
Fuck yeah, alternative timeline.
---
Don't feel bad, that's the fuck how money works. Demand 🤷
---
Could still nerf that further with some penalties. Check out griffon mount from gw2
---
I’ve been trying things here and there and then playing to see it’s weird because I leveled all the way to 29 before this started happening. I have event tracker that sounds similar to crash log but it’s not showing much information on a cause.
---
Exactly
---
And especially right now, the vast majority are still leveling, and at their own pace, etc
---
Once a lot of people have hit 60, grouping should be a bit more consistent. Though keep in mind as well, plenty of people level alts as well so there'll still be plenty of people at various level ranges, etc
---
Is that a working energy tick? I cant find one that doesn't get out of Sync when your energy is full.
---
For me that’s when I stopped enjoying Ret. 
---
I had PVP’d as Ret all thru Vanilla / BC &amp; took pride in making the spec work because it was meme. 
---
When divine storm was added it made the spec so brain dead anybody that keybound the 3 buttons could hit 2.2k+ really took away my sense of achievement &amp; pride. 
---
Just my 2 cents
---
Expansions with modifiers. Max 1 min flying then 5 min cd for example. No dungeon fiender and Im good! Also. Keep it difficult
---
You are wrong, it’s not the same. Party members has a number asigned to them by default. You have party member 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Mobs do not have a numbers asigned to them. 
---
There most definitely is a way to make a macro that sequences party member 1-5, I’ve seen macros like it before, but unfortunately I personally don’t know how to write it.
---
Can you use fists in ass?
---
When someone complains just tell them to drink their own tears.
---
That's a fair stance and I don't disagree with it really. Singular DPS classes need to be rewarded more than Hybrids on a DPS role is my opinion. If you believe that the singular DPS classes should be rewarded in the form of desirable utility rather than raw DPS I can get on board with that.
---
Thank you for trusting reddit more than google! I would recommend this one:

If you know how to heal and keep one set of int/spirit cloth&amp;leather you can heal dungeons as Enhancement without any issues up to 50ish dungeons at least, possibly up to 60.
---
That was Titan, a different IP, not WoW2.
---
They’re night elf eyes!

What, making literally all of them more interesting and playable?

nah fuck that i want to feel like i am upgrading my char with better gear not i have something in my gear set from like 3 tiers ago. other games have tried it and they all suck.  people play the game to feel like there time and eff mean something.

Can the priest use the victim to attack and use abilities of the victim?

Nice. I saw someone from &lt;Guild&gt; earlier today in Org

Antifa arent liberal ;)
---
This is exactly how I felt as a Warrior at 20 (though I couldn't do the quest until I'd leveled up a bit more). You mean I have to go *where*? How do I even get there? I need to kill so many of these spiders to get FIFTY fangs? Then go to a horde zone in kalimdor?? And then clear an instance there, and that's the halfway point?
---
It was an adventure, and I loved it. I was so excited to go on that journey, I met warrior friends, and at the end, after ~5 hours, I got an insane breastplate PLUS a bonus quest for my first helmet. Talk about rewarding! 
---
Retail doesn't have that.
---
the fresh corpse kinda suggests that the gnome killed someone.
---
Second one
---
Alright, so now that I'm just level 30 I don't need to concern myself with it? Right now I try to heal in bursts and also get a spirit tap now and then to have no downtime.
---
I can’t try it now, but something like this should work:
---
/castsequence reset=target [@party1]Arcane Intellect; [@party2]Arcane Intellect; [@party3]Arcane Intellect; [@party4]Arcane Intellect; [@party5]Arcane Intellect
---
Every time you press the button, it casts the next ik the sequence: so pressing it five times casts the buff on each target. “@party1” means the first party member, from top to bottom.
---
The reset condition resets the sequence when you target something, so to cancel or to restart, target anyone. You can also set it to “combat” or “10” to reset on combat or after 10 seconds, respectively.
---
Not to mention the poor respawn rate
---
Thanks for pointing this out. It also allows them to try and build aggro instead of your first heal pulling it off them.
---
nice
---
Classic+ and classic expansions are basically the same thing.
---
&gt;since the entire point is to finish instances as quickly as possible to stay productive
---
And the best way of doing that is by NOT WIPING.
---
no consent required if Im a gnome there
---
Well  "along with 4 others killing" if it was a grp of 4 that simply doesnt invite you for no reason you are fine they are dickheads. If it was a full grp and they have been waiting allready your would have been the dick imho.

Classic+ would be awesome, I never even though about that, I bet they could do some really cool things if they just kept the game at 60 and added new zones. 
---
Classic TBC is my dream though. While I think WoW peaked at Ulduar and Arthas, TBC was the prime time for me in WoW.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4542/high-inquisitor-fairbanks#drops](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=4542/high-inquisitor-fairbanks#drops)  
---
Drop is not listed here? Missing something?
---
I'm pretty sure they will go for a 4th option. After phase 6 they will  not touch the game anymore. Just keeping it alive.
---
Yeah, I guess some people are too trusting, after being on the internet for over a decade I've lost my trust in strangers lol
---
Try eight months of a baby not sleeping and you’ll soon forget most things.
---
AWESOME! You did a great job thank you for sharing it with us, grats on 60 and I hope you do another (maybe with horde!)  I thought this was really cool.
---
As I understood it: no
---
There was a third occasion of another dude recently but he was super nice about it and suggested I need seal of righteousness on at all times but yeah.
---
With the seal of crusader, do you perhaps know or another seal to use instead? Seal or light was neat when I was using that a while ago but i never really used it much
---
I'd like to see the classic expansions but classic+ could very well become the WoW people talk about. It could in a way reset and make a new beginning and be its own thing.
---
For me the second and third options sound the most appealing, but hey I don't think I'll ever make 60! 😅
---
I will try it later today and post if it works. Thank you for your time.
---
and another 10 with tier1 set bonus
---
Yeah people like to throw absolutely meaningless comments at meaningless meme pictures. This is a very awesome feat for this community to have.
---
Honestly though: it's a perfect example for quantity vs. quality. The later of which this sub is missing A LOT
---
muhahahahaaaaaaaaaa
---
Went from reasonable to dumb real quick right there.
---
This whole thing took a dark turn when Fatherwilson continued to bless....other things of the young stable boy Bullfase.
---
They require flying only because they’re too far/high to jump to. A Flight Path or ground-access would fix it.
---
When my char name is AskReddit, i got a lil confused seing this.
---
&gt; Also, professions can be gold sinks, especially enchanting and engineering.
---
&gt; You must have spent your money on something stupid while leveling surely.
---
Agree with homogenization. Replenishment completely destroyed my class identity as a shadow priest. Mages got Time Warp, buffs become more standardized. I had such fond memories of refilling my healer groups entire mana bars in Bloodboil and that was stripped away and all I got in return was a 51 point talent that kept me alive for 5 seconds before I died to the next Divine Storm.
---
Lol nice one

They are ripped from their families in the void. That's why you summon them. They have to do your will because you're stronger.
---
But im talking about the one click macro so im 100% not wrong. You cant possibly do it with only using the macro once. Thats my point. Macro exist to make your life easier not to overwrite the purpose of spell (which is to buff single target party member in this scenario)
---
Im all in for classic+. That would be amazing!
---
Nothing killed wow. Idk what it is about you guys,  ut a game isn't dying or being killed just because you don't like it.
---
The game kept growing and subs spiked during wrath. And it was pretty steadily the most popular mmo out there for a long time after.
---
This might be a direction I wouldn’t mind. Adding Hyjal, “twilight highlands” (give it a new name), and Northern Lorderon. Add new reps with items that allow alternative play styles at endgame without diminishing existing ones.
---
There is no harm in keeping the 10 player cap of that dungeon but tune it for level 60s.
---
However, I think it's way better to do the expansions naturally without changing them. In classic, end game playstyle wasn't exactly exciting for quite some classes/specs. Expansions would bring a breath of fresh air to the playstyle and especially the meta. Spamming one button during boss fights and AOE farming dungeons is only enjoyable for a certain amount of time...
---
Classic+ needs to introduce dungeons that are only doable with full Naxx gear else they will interfere with classic progress and raid order. 
---
Same thing with quests - we must not get a new area with quests and gear that makes us skip old areas and dungeons.
---
This all pretty much sums up my dungeon experience so far. I fucking hate tanking I can't stand it anymore. But it's "expected of me".
---
I used it before this, this is [Resurgence Rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17743/resurgence-rod)
---
10 screenshots per level is still 600 pictures to scroll through. Still too long. 
---
But 40 minutes though? And that level of epileptic screen vomit was enough for me after 20s.
---
Haha yeah I've found this too. At 31 I was looking for groups for Gnomeregan and my requests would always get followed up by a 32 or 33 mage. Can be pretty tough finding groups until SM where everyone wants 3 mages to spell cleave.
---
If you go the osrs way and make more content for the classic game without just ruining it ie.
---
Dont just make a level 60 raid that makes it pointless to do any other content.
---
Possibly add drops to old raids you need to progress in the new ones to keep people going back and keep it active.
---
Maybe change gear up so in this new zone your old gear doesn't work as effective so you have a reason to farm new gear, but if you go back to old zones your normal gear is still better.
---
Then you dont end up with a bunch of people in the new zone doing nothing but the new raids and never going anywhere else.
---
whoosh
---
Yeah thats pretty crazy, why do that when you can just click the mob and afk for several seconds
---
1st. Dual talent specialization came with tbc.
---
2nd spriests can heal dungeons without problems
---
3rd no matter what spec first 5 points should go to spirit tap while leveling anyway
---
Expansions probably. But only to a point, TBC seems feasible, maybe even WOTLK but what's the point in going further than that? Either way they could bring back a lot of interest to the probably dwindling classic playerbase a few years down the line when the phases are up and all the content has been released and played to death. Might split the playerbase from Classic Vanilla to say TBC servers, but a lot more players would be willing to come back and play TBC I'd wager.
---
&gt; Desolace would be even worse for alliance because it's all horde.
---
Has not been my experience at all, desolace is largely empty and certainly doesn't have any where near the ganking that STV does.  It's far better to level in desolace as an alliance than go to STV at that level.  Then you go to STV later at like 36-38 and are less likely to get ganked.
---
I would love to go through BC and WotLK as I started in Cata but I know it will probably kill the game in the long run as it would be all the same content as people have played before. I really love the idea of the Classic + similar to what OSRS has done. Everyone has always talked about 'what if' scenarios and this would be the perfect time to live them out
---
I didn't, but I saw someone mention that some cell towers block port 0
---
Wtf is mana 
---
*laughs in roguish* 😎👉👉
---
its inconsistent
---
if ur ambush fails u gonna have a bad time
---
combat doesnt get hurt that much by misses cuz of better white dmg
---
following
---
Absolute, unusable garbage and a waste of breath of whoever made it
---
How.. After like 20 purposeful idiom screw up's in a row, you figured this was the comment that actually messed something up..?
---
Dual talent was actually wrath not tbc.
---
Yeah if their character is sitting or /sleeping, your next spell or attack is a garunteed crit..so for all of you rogues out there about to jump someone with low life wait until they sit down and start eating, it will look insane od you use ambush and basically kill them with just ambush
---
I killed a female troll rogue because I was afraid she'd turn on me while I was doing a quest, and before she died she did a /wave at me and was jumping up and down not fighting back. It's been days and I'm still thinking about that shit. So much guilt dude.
---
Classic Expansions for me.
---
I have wanted an official Wrath of the Lich King server for years. It's easily my favourite incarnation of WoW. Better than Vanilla, better than TBC. I have never had as much fun with WoW than I did during Wrath.
---
Levelling as a Prot Warrior, revenging all the way to 80... god it was so good.
---
What about a Guildwars-2-like system where they release new content that drops items that have t-3 comparable stats and new textures/skins?
---
Not so long ago I was thinking WoW must surely end soon and that BfA would be remembered as the point of no return.
---
Suddenly, (not even considering future WoW retail expansions), we've got a potential 10+ more years of WoW courtesy of content we were playing 10+ years ago. It's a strange paradox.
---
I for one am enjoying Classic and its popularity.
---
You need to find a tailor real soon my man :')
---
Ooof, spicy AF
---
Yeah, I looked it up quickly and apparently they already added it back in BC. Also forgot about the 'auto-join' option you could toggle.. Still a much better system than what we have now.
---
I am really tired of people just quitting after 1 wipe, specially if it's due to an accident that can be recovered and the run otherwise is smooth. 
---
Did ZF yesterday, normal quest run, and had tank leave when a pull went bad. We were otherwise going at a good pace.
---
Then, next group, tank left again when he lost roll on a weapon.
---
My point being; When I walk into dungeons I expect that there is always a risk of a wipe happening. I don't expect to win every roll. To me, in such cases, the leavers show a disrespect for others time. I can understand it if it's clearly not working out, bit yea..
---
/rant
---
I honestly think that newer players aren’t aware that we used to have a blacklist back in vanilla and that this current retail toxicity isn’t accepted by those of us who played at the start of the game. I say blacklist the lot of them and make it known who these people are and they will eventually scurry back to whatever game they came from be it retail wow or league or wherever else their toxic behaviour is brushed off.
---
Can't link it but basically it does not involve getting anything more than the Mana cost off heals and the armor buff on crits in resto and that's it, but don't bother with that until you have the +5% Mana talent and also %off shock spells.
---
From there follow the attack (Not totem) chain in enhance until you get two hand weapons for solo or dps roles. 
---
Keep a good caster staff and chestpiece around for healing dungeons. 
---
Be aware, you will be chugging drinks after most fights and have to conserve Mana but totems can help with that.
---
Also, setup 2 downranked healing waves and lesser healing wave on your bars for top offs. You will rarely need to consistently use your biggest heal. Just focus on keeping them above 50% during trash pills and an eye out for spells to cancel with rank 1 Earthshock.
---
Shaman is incredibly adaptable.
---
why does it suck?
---
That’s the point about meaningfulness, yeah.
---
Also, now I enjoy watching cartoons with my 5yo daughter. Our house is full of pony from My Little Pony and it’s also so fun. That “adults” who says “games are a wasting of time” just boring people, who mostly do job-home-tv. Ofc you can replace “games” here with another fun and enjoyable activity.
---
I second here about having a balance ofc
---
I know how you feel. Tanking is hard. And this aoe spellcleave disease is spreading. 
---
You can't pull mobs around corners because the moment you turn towards them everything is full of dots. 
---
I felt the same way you did couple of days ago. I didn't sign up as tank anymore, or for dungeons in general unless there's a really good quest reward. 
---
So, yesterday i was looking for a kathedral group to get my Sword of Omen, and i lfg'd as dd. 
---
Dude wrote me, asking me if i'd be willing to tank instead. They've been looking for a tank for a long while and can't find one. 
---
So i thought let's give it another try. And boy, that was hell of a good run. 
---
The group focused the target, let me pull properly, held off aoe dps until i had couple of seconds to build up threat, nobody drew aggro, it was just picture perfect world of warcraft. 
---
We went through the instance so smoothly and so fast i even went in another time with them. I ended up on all of their friendlists and finally i felt like a real tank again. It was just great. 
---
Keep up the good work. You'll find a good group once in a while. And if it's just one good group out of one hundred, it'll still be worth it.
---
This. People doesn't realize that each expansion bring good thing and bad thing for the game. TBC and Lich king had a ton of shitty things and WOD, Legion and BFA have a ton of good ones
---
You should try using questie. One of its features is showing you available quests on the map. Playing with vs without it, there's a huge number of quests that you'll just never stumble across unless you wander around and talk to every npc everywhere.
---
Please update when you have tried it, would like to use it tonight if it works on those horde scum aswell!
---
I now enabled questies mechanic to show me where quests are. Doesnt take the fun out of finding out where you need to go but lets you see all these randomly appearing quests in various cities.
---
I usually terrorise mage to do me conjured water and drop on my ass as soon as I leave combat.
---
I massively dig some sort of notice board in every capital which you post LFG stuff on.
---
Wrong. In retail, if you play a Demon Hunter, you need to double jump once at least every 30 seconds or else you start taking damage.
---
I would sacrifice multiple favorite body parts for a WotLK server
---
My experience as well.  I was going to get my ass in gear and get my tank to 60 asap.  But I've ended up taking time to smell the flowers.  And then rolling an alt to pick the flowers.
---
And I've spent far too much time fishing :D
---
Yep.  
---
Can't make it work back.
---
they can fuck that up, but at least they would have tried something else.
---
Warriors drop in popularity at 60 since people give up on leveling them.
---
Killing dwarfs is pretty nice. But killing gnomes is where the real satisfaction lies.
---
So this is why they're saying another recession is coming soon, oh shit oh fuck
---
I think you are better off just buying them off of a vendor and farming other stuff for money. 
---
By the way, he will need to eat less once he is max loyalty rank with you.
---
Have fun and enjoy ur new pet.
---
I'm just having so much fun in this community. In game and on reddit!
---
Shazzrah is probably best place but there are queues in the evening.
---
I play on Shazzrah and Skullflame.
---
(Horde obvs)
---
Yes please of you increase level cap you fuck vanilla.
---
I think *true Classic* is a thing worth keeping and I honestly don’t suppose Blizzard would even consider overwriting the Classic servers. I’m really looking forward to The Burning Crusade though! I doubt anything past WotLK would lure a large junk of the current Classic playerbase, but I have a feeling I’m not the only one who would really like to get an authentic Outland experience again.
---
With that said, Classic+ sounds good... For me it would have to be something along the lines of expanding towards BC because Blizzard’s unofficial announcement of “further expansions not being as hard to create as vanilla” made me almost as happy as the original WoW Classic announcement. But I think most of us would probably welcome new quests or even zones if they stay true to the authentic Classic experience.
---
Something like this is what you do to summon the energy to put another two hours into a more tedious task. Things like this help (lol) the overall crunch effort, not hinder it.
---
All three options are dumb.
---
"True Classic" is absolute lunacy. People would quit in droves if they did regular server resets. This isn't Diablo.
---
Classic + is wishful thinking at best. It would essentially mean Classic becoming its own game. They can barely develop one MMO, they're not gonna develop two of them at the same time. 
---
Expansions is the only remotely reasonable one, but if it would dilute the playerbase to oblivion in the mid/long term.
---
Because it was hard?
---
&gt;heading towards retail which would ruin the "classic" in classic wow even if done well.
---
It's a risk I am willing to take. What's the worst thing that can happen? Me not liking the new stuff and quitting the game? Same thing will happen if it stales so I have literally nothing to lose.
---
&gt;not go to Retail where there are years of content
---
This argument makes no sense to me. So I shouldn't ask for a Dark Souks 4 because there is a lot of content in other games like elder scrolls and the witcher? I'm not gonna play a game I don't like just because it has content. I rather not play anything than play something I don't enjoy.
---
Well, rogues are probably the easiest to take anyone by surprise and, most people try to run away if they see you and jump/run..and if you're lucky they wont notice that they just auto targeted someone casting a spell on them while they are eating..but yes feral works with this one specifically
---
I mean there is no need to stop them from doing pugs. In either way its beneficial for you guild.
---
Idd, level 60 rogues corpse camping you for no reason. Geez.
---
This is crazy. I hate not seeing nameplates until I am almost right on top of mobs.
---
It’s 1:30am and I’m in BRD. No end in sight.
---
Not 100% equivalent, but I broke a 100k mana pool in H25 ICC iirc
---
While I mainly level in Kalimdor as Horde, Hillsbrad, Arathi, Vietnam are good leveling zones.
---
MMMMP groups in cath have figured out how to open the doors and just pull the boss.
---
Can someone explain what is happening here?
---
Everything up to WotLK felt like going from strength to strength; Pandaria was when Blizzard shit the bed.
---
You still get accuracy and your white damage is on par with combat except for dw spec (which you can choose to go into).  Ambush missing isn't that big of a deal anyway, you're still running 40+% crit backstab as well.  
---
Gouge being parried causes more downtime, and even that isn't a big deal.
---
It already has at least one, and always has. Legend has it that there is still undiscovered content in Vanilla, and that at least one of those items may be another ghost quest.
---
I see your "Not enough Rage" and raise you "Not enough energy"
---
one good thing to include "permanent" flying mount would make than the only points where you can mount and dismount it are the start/finish of a flying path, but you can explore how you want.  
---
So you can fly freely, but in the end, can only come back on the ground in flying path. It prevent "oh non, flying mount to escape!" or "i'll just fly where the quest is..." while helping players to see the world on another perspective or have free and sometime faster flying (since you can go directly from a flying point to another without being forced to pass by all the others)
---
I hate myself when im autorunning semi-afk, notice I've gotten arcane intellect and didn't even see the player casting it. Often times i just /y TY, but i want to /thank or /cheer
---
Who quests there?
---
Yeah, certainly not a new trend. Myself and many others have been doing that ever since unit frame add-ons were created.
---
Sorry BRE? So u say just go dual wield? My understanding was that if im not hit capped, dw was the worse option. I must clarify: this Will just be pre raid. Once we start doing raids i Will find better gear and get better weapons.
---
Gorilla eats bread and fungus too. Don't remember right now but you might find cooking profession useful.
---
&gt;consistently topped or minimum top 5 in dps
---
Check this guy out!
---
note: that guy saying thank you, was from me randomly healing someone as i auto ran by, right as he was dieing lol.
---
Glad you solved it. Dont lock your fps though, it has no benefit unless you are trying to cap it lower that the refresh rate of your monitor.
---
Mograine seems to be the most balanced PvP server. And it sits just beneath the most popular servers in terms of sheer numbers. Queue times arent bad, and I would rather have queues now and a healthy server later than no queue times now and a semi dead server in a couple of months.
---
In b4 LFR, dailies, and cash shop
---
hmm didnt know you could use 0 in a castsequence like that
---
Ion is a lawyer, who cares? Software engineers at least have an ability to disassemble any problem into components and analyze them before making a decision.
---
the queus are awful, how is fraction balance?
---
Thanks, now I can stop blocking people and just make notes instead
---
I'd rather the guards target anyone botting trying to sell the recipes for ridiculous amounts.
---
Are they still bis for fury warriors?
---
Maybe a OSRS type system. where the community vote for what they want.
---
Let's keep level cap at 60 but add new zones, quests and dungeons only available to ppl who cleared Nax or BWL (via some RP reason and quest chains).
---
New content could have experimental gear which e.g. alters class talents etc.
---
TBH, the art that comes out of the classic launch is lowkey the best thing that is happening to the community outside of the game.
---
Classic expansions for sure, dedicated servers, but able to copy your existing character, like a free transfer or something, up to WotLK, nothing more than that!!!! Take ma money and life!
---
You're a bit late for the downvote train
---
Ahh yes. So brave to be ganking people when you are guaranteed not to lose.
---
I can confirm this. Remember 10k dps specifically.
---
I've found that when this happens, pressing 'Open all' on the empty mailbox makes the items/gold turn up in your inventory.
---
I see very very few paladins
---
Makes three of us lol. Druid tho
---
didn't expect to see hearthstone copypasta here
---
Problem is that the majority of players would probably not want to replay the same cycle of content over and over more than maybe a couple of times. 
---
It would be cool to have servers for this if the players are up for it but I think it needs to open up to new content at some point aswell with the classic spirit intact.
---
Do you actually unironically care about karma points on reddit?
---
Classic+, if Blizzard has learned from their mistakes. No flying mounts. 
---
Please add updated character models though. I can appreciate the originals, but they really are ugly.
---
Its Druid. Like, hands down, its Druid.
---
Ty for your thoughts
---
that sounds reasonable !
---
Not really answering your question but there is a macro that combines 3 melee abilities into 1 button and reduces bloat by a lot.
---
#showtooltip
---
/stopcasting
---
/cast Raptor Strike
---
/startattack
---
/cast Counterattack
---
/cast Mongoose Bite
---
The first line stops auto shot if it is toggled on. The second line will begin your melee attack, regardless of distance to target. The next three lines cast abilities. Because Raptor Strike and Mongoose Bite function differently, they can be used simultaneously. Counterattack and Mongoose Bite cannot be used simultaneously, but Counterattack is a priority, so it's listed first.
---
More macros here: https://classicwow.live/guides/893/hunter-macros-tips
---
Expansions for sure... Want to play both TBC and WotLK. My feelings are still split between those two. I've had equal amount of fun in both expansions.
---
What was the original classic hellfire peninsula? How was it different from outland hellfire peninsula?
---
There is a official serverwide Looking For Group chat in game which is pretty much what you ask for.
---
You can join it either by "/join Looking for Group" or through the chat configuration where you just have to click a button.
---
Same for World Defense.
---
Yep - in fact I have the opposite problem, I'm following a quest guide because I'm lazy AF, and I'm rapidly outlevelling the guide suggested levels because I find other stuff to do along the way.
---
This or drive by Soulstoning
---
So I play Alliance on Skullflame, and Horde on Dreadmist.  I found Dreadmist better hardly ever a queue, but bust on high at peak times.  Last stats were 53% horde and 47% alliance.  Also happy to team up if you like, just drop me a PM.
---
**True Classic:** after investing so much time in new characters, getting them all the way through everything, the last thing anyone would want to do is reset them to zero. And how would they decided when D-Day was? What if you hadn't achieved what you wanted before it happened, only to be kicked back to level 1 to be forced to do it all over again. **Not viable.**
---
**Classic+:** their entire dev team is still focused on Retail. Classic was just a side project for some of them, but it's not their day job. I doubt they'd invest time and money into creating new content, using the old artwork and old mechanics/engine. Retail was able to develop into what it is today (referring specifically to encounters and artwork) because of advances in technology - Vanilla didn't look, or play as fluidly as Retail, because it just wasn't possible 15 years ago. **Not viable.**
---
**Classic Expansions:** I'm guessing this would be the only logical route. The shared feeling among many is that the expansions (zones, encounters, etc) weren't what made the game bad - it was all the unnecessary crap they added to it along the way (already listed in other posts) that took the game further away from the Vanilla experience. *Any* raid encounter in TBC is already miles ahead of anything Vanilla had to offer (MC and Onyxia went down on the *same day*, they were that easy) - and that's just the next expansion. Take out all the unnecessary, welfare epic click-here-to-win bullshit, and then progress into the next expansion. Keep the talent trees. Keep the same class/race combos (Tauren Priests? Was that one of those high-as-fuck 3 in the morning decisions?), keep the same systems, etc. **Viable.**
---
Having another client for TBC, WotLK, Cata, etc, simply wouldn't work - it means, if we cycle through everything, that there will be 8 different versions of the game live at the same time (excluding Retail, which already has all previous versions included, albeit, altered). Just about everyone loved Vanilla - it's why we've all flocked back to it. But what would happen to the Classic WoD servers? Or the Cata servers? I'm sure as hell not going to roll a charcter on them. Additionally, we're not being charged for Classic at the moment - we get it for free with our Retail subs. But if you eventually have to run 9 different clients, with multiple new servers over multiple regions for each, £10 a month isn't going to be enough to keep the lights on anymore. **Not viable.**
---
Samething thing can be said to hunters, and so far I've seen more hunters than Mages in EU servers. When a poly the pet and stay in the hunter dead zone more of them have no idea what to do.
---
This isn't my world...
---
# DISAPPOINTED!
---
the fun thing is that the same people who asked that are now "yeah, fuck blizzard for adding LFG" and other things.
---
Are they really similar i am thinking to get some training in JS soon
---
+ happiness drops to neutral when you have him like, 30 minutes next to you. Also needs another food when it dies. In 2 days, I've consumed like 4 stacks of food. That's high...
---
You don't get the implications on the game if a small minority has other expectations for fun.
---
From a sales point of view Blizzard wants both groups. They tried to satisfy both and failed in my opinion.
---
By the way, they already did what you said in a lot of cases they changed the game to stop some peoples playstyles.
---
They did it everytime the impact of that behaviour is so toxic that it endager the sales of other groups.
---
In my opinion the impact on the game in behaviour of players is so toxic and so big that there is no way to have a stable satisfied community.
---
Do you know why I know this? Cause I played Vanilla and it had that effect. It did lead exactly to those changes that people now say "Wow, this is classic, hey look how much fun I have, why did they change that?" \_BEFORE\_ that kind of toxic "efficency" consumes everything like an avalanche.
---
Blizzard changed the game to the worse cause of those people and their "fun". So I have to ask: why do those people don't stay away from Classic before they lead us to the same path as before?
---
The gameplay in this game depends vital on the behaviour people in groups.
---
"Efficient fun" people are the problem. They cause a kind of toxic behaviour that was and is unacceptable for having fun for the most people.
---
But how? I literally see them everywhere.
---
What is that 1s dies, you receive 1d xp? Seems to be a thing in th German client. This also shows up at the meeting stones in front of instances. Saw that at a friend of mine. Is this a bug?
---
Honestly it is exactly like I expected it to be. People are so used to sped up games. In the first days everyone was happy to be home and stuff. Now its a speed fest...
---
Druids and shamans are lowest played.
---
Warriors are most popular.

3 dodges, 0 overpower... damn, change stance ffs
---
Well, logically there would be a hell of a lot more boats... Ironically on retail there are many more but nobody ever has to use them.
---
Ironforge was the real capital in vanilla, with the AH and proximity to Menethil and BRM.
---
I've seen tanks do this and a mage or Warwick in my group starts spamming group chat with "pull more" or "mass pull"
---
I grew up playing other MMOs than WoW when vanilla was out but definitely went on to become a game dev and then leave the industry again. It has some of the most amazing people and fun projects (at times) but the bad compensation and shit you have to deal with makes it feel not worth it sometimes. :(

Agreed. But at least this way you have options to break the mold. I used to change my build as my gear evolved as my stats changed how my build worked.
---
I'm laughing, because this reminds me of two days ago, when that 1 Alliance was 60 and two-shotting every horde player in sight. And even though I was the victim of that one player (and I made 0 exp that evening) we still had fun playing the cat and mouse game.
---
Strongly disagree. 
---
The people that rushed to 60 and flew through content have only themselves to blame. If they're burnt out already, it's because the no-lifed from launch. They'll do the same with the new content anyway, so it makes no difference to the long term population. 
---
Players that are still leveling, taking their time and enjoying what is currently available in game, are the ones that need taking care of. They are the ones that will stick around, roll alts and ultimately make up the majority of the long term population. 
---
Also, you're kinda being a hypocrite... 'let's rush out 2 phases in the space of a few months to hold onto the population'... Yeah, and then rush the rest of it out in another few months and what do you have left? No more content, I.e no reason for anyone to stick around.
---
Fuck I hope to hell you never try meth
---
Agree, never used a single one and I raided and ran tons of 5 mans from BC launch until Wrath launch. My LFG was my guild, friends list, and chat channels.
---
Oh believe me I know, I’m loving questing right now, so many different stories to read, so many mobs to kill. It’s great.
---
Simple as innit
---
Yep. "Convenient".
---
If everyone had their "small", "convenient" change, we'd be back at retail. :P (Sorry.)
---
classic expansions!
---
Trust me you are doing very good as long as you are in control of what your priorities are
---
I would love Classic+
---
This sounds insanely intriguing.
---
 I can't tell you who's better on farming maraudon, sorry but I think Hunter can do solo tribute runs later in Dire Maul.
---
I dont mind hubs. Gives me an area to return to to rest at, knowing I can access all necessary commodities from there.
---
Badges are nice, they remove the overreliance on loot councils/RNG assigning you loot, allowing you to always progress towards SOMETHING.
---
I dont see a problem with Daily quests making you log in everyday. MMOs are commitments, you will never get anywhere if you dont put in consistent time and Daily quests give you consistent rewards for putting in time.
---
It's the only logical path to me. We are obviously a group that are unhappy with where retail ended up so why go down a path that leads to where we know we won't be Happ?
---
I'd rather have Metallica, "so close, no matter how far!"
---
I cannot upvote this enough...
---
You clearly dont know what you are talking about. With the beginning of AV anyone will run Alterac Rep and the AV will just get rushed. It takes about 1-2 weeks to get AV exalted. Maybe even less than that.
---
I think it was between sunwell and BT yeah. I remember you needed to have some sort of necklace for BT, was a rather long questchain. :)
---
Let's enjoy classic for at least 18 months. Ask me in a year but let's open the discussion.
---
If they implement a polling system for updates, a la OSRS, as a player new to WoW with Classic, I will choose to not participate in the polls. I'll leave that to players who know the history and nuances of the game
---
No, they don’t
---
Same. I rolled a rogue this time around, and it's nice and peaceful.
---
Definitely worth a /whistle
---
I’m a 60 priest healer and haven’t had a Druid tank I’ve enjoyed yet
---
Yea i love feline swiftness (i think it is called) with +30%, since lvl 21 , til i get cheetah now in 3 levels!
---
but pls... CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW THE VANILLA TRAVEL MOUNT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE GET WITH BAMBI IN RETAIL?!?!
---
:P
---
Also.. you could it see it like that:
---
Mage has blinking
---
WL and pala have almost a free mount
---
Rogue has sprint
---
Hunter has aspect
---
Shamy has wolf
---
Druid has cheetah
---
Warri... Has nothing :D
---
(Well..some creative warriors use charge on nearby mobs so....)
---
False.
---
That's because of the area. Hillsbrad horde quests are lvl 25-28 but hillsbrad alliance quests are lvl 35-38.
---
Not yet
---
We already know it works for WoW because that's what private servers did. There's hardly a difference between resets in PoE and WoW aside from the cycle being about 8 times as long. The casual players can just stick to the existing servers. The general way this would work is that your character isn't deleted, but just moved to a permanent server that includes characters from all previous seasons and new, seasonal servers are created for those that which to start over.
---
You’re kind of right. Under the *code* of conduct section blizzard does encourage reporting antisocial behaviour, but the “rule” is extremely vague. Even with the aforementioned report counter, I’ll assume that behavioural reports are bottom prio. If you read the Loot Ninja section on vanilla wow wiki there’s this segment:
---
&gt;**Blizzard’s official policy:** Blizzard will usually only take action for a blatant scam, such as a raid leader declaring free rolls in chat and then master-looting everything to himself. They will not intervene if there was no prior agreement (and cannot if the agreement was made over Ventrilo or a private forum- it has to be in game, where they can check logs). In any PuG raid, ask the raid leader to state the loot policy explicitly in chat.
---
What did I do wrong?
---
I mean, I don't actively check my karma, but I do use it to gauge whether or not people are trolling. If someone posts something that seems a bit stupid, I'll check their karma, and usually read a few of their previous comments on other subs. If it's really low I'll generally assume they're trolls.
---
Just to make it a little different than TBC Karazhan, Teron Gorefiend should be the last boss and make the storyline more connected with the Black Riders of Deadwind Pass, Scythe of Elune, Arugal, the Book of Ur and the worgen. Prince Malchezaar could maybe make a cameo post appearance as being the even more sinister being Brann Bronzebeard mentions in the Horde Player's Guide. Karazhan could be a Tier 2-2.5 raid probably.
---
a lot of warriors, i suppose a chaman for his stupidly good totems + heal if needed, and a bear druid ?
---
I honestly have not once read anyone ask for LFG unironically
---
Honestly mate, just fuck off back to retail holy shit you casuals make me mad
---
The majority of people will only be hitting 60 when phase 2 rolls around. Calm your farm.
---
Eh. No, let’s not.
---
Spoiler: one of the spellcasters won it
---
That’s a cool idea. Food isn’t really an issue with the pet, just those damn arrows.
---
OP claiming reference bonus points UNDESERVINGLY
---
depend of your build (cat, bear, balance druid)
---
In the future you can even save a hearthstone cooldown by leaving group, and automatically getting ported to Stormwind after 1 minute
---
So you have one?
---
&gt; Alliance has what? Darkshore, Ashenvale, Stonetalon, and Loch modan 
---
For level 15-20 you have Westfall and Redridge Mountains. The only running is between them and Stormwind, where you follow Defias Brotherhood quest line, that have sweet blue items in the end. Plus Duskwood for 25+
---
Questie has a feature that tracks which quests you have completed in a zone and which you have still yet to do, but I don't know if it works retroactively for quests you've done before installing the it.
---
Really? Strange, I see it pretty much every day.
---
True classic! :)
---
Never again
---
It's a world drop, it can drop from every kind of mob, so it is EXTREMELY rare.
---
Thank you.
---
This really annoys me in US sitcoms when one character says "by accident" and then another straight after says "on accident".
---
That's not what not being sure means
---
Druids suck for leveling dungeons and pug. That's just how it is. They have no resurrect, but they do have a bres on a 30m cool down. Burst heals aren't great, but their dot heals are amazing. Tons of buffs, but only 5 people to buff. 
---
 Later on in raid parties the bres is potentially raid saving, you can buff 40 people and spread your hots across the group. But before then, why not just take the shaman.
---
In 8-10 levels you'll be in Vietnam. You won't need bgs for you PvP itch then.
---
In just 4 hours of questing I got killed 8 times.
---
Link me some of that. All I ever see is basically this post verbatim mocking these people I've never seen proof exist. This sub is a massive circlejerk.
---
I think that Classic+ runs into a similar problem as games such as HL3. Classic is held in such a high standard, that no matter what content is released by Blizzard people will always find ways to shoot it down. Some people will love the changes, some will get frustrated that the game no longer feels like Classic.
---
Releasing old expansions runs into the problem of what happens when we reach expansions such as WoD or BFA Do we just restart again from Vanilla? Blizzard wont invest money into old expansion servers if they don't see them as a way to make money, and some people might find it unfair their favorite expansion wont be released.
---
I could be wrong... all we can do really is just wait and hope Blizzard does the right thing.
---
Whitemane checking in. Got a BoE caster dagger in BFD and immediately gave it away. Poor guy hit greed because he didn't want to be accused of being a ninja.
---
I’m not interested in any expansions. Maybe flush out the stuff classic had before by. Karazan 60 is a good example.
---
The problem is that the zones were designed with flying in mind
---
I'm just saying I would like them to finish what they had to abandon. let them have made their original plans come to fruition,  They would have had an idea in mind for stats and all that. Maybe they would have stacked on the stats like you suggest, Maybe not. it was the Wild west of warcraft after all.
---
Rise of the Neo-Classical Era of Wow
---
Could you please add voting? I am genuinely interested in seeing the most prevalent choice of players.
---
That’s good info. Thanks.
---
&gt;  it's 100% true
---
Except no. Factorio is such a well crafted and polished game that anyone can lose track of time playing it. I know plenty non-autistic people who love the game.
---
It's the 2nd highest rated game on Steam of all time.
---
Does it scan players only on the region I'm at or does it scan all regions in the game? If I'm in Mulgore, will it only scan players from Mulgore?
---
Good, everyone is on same page as me. No one forced you to level and clear raid as fast as possible.
---
That's a good question! Imo yes, without a doubt, though one thing to keep in mind is that it's a long and cost heavy process. To back up my words see [this wow guide on enchanting](https://mmoauctions.com/news/wow-classic-enchanting-fastest-way-to-go-from-1-to-300) and you should get a clearer picture of what I meant by that LoL
---
Even though i love both TBC/Wrath for the lore and for the hours/days of fun i had, i would rather see classic +. BRAND NEW content other people havent spent 8 years min/maxing. Everybody is on the same clean slate and we move forward as a community to new and exiciting obstacles.
---
Well I sure as hell want Burning Crusade, but beyond that I'm not sure.
---
I'm not sure it would feel the "same" if they made Classic+, I'm pretty sure the new team would fuck up things that made the original game so great.
---
Hah. I want naxxramas in 12 hours or I'll stop playing WoW! /s
---
Pretty sad how dead that guild is  and realm is pretty dead too
---
How appropriate, you fight like a cow.
---
You can play the expansions that altered WoW in retail. Even TBC started down that road and is not the same classic experience.  
---
Give us content for classic, don’t retread what changed wow.
---
Depends on your server. Warlocks and druids are the least played on my server alliance side. Warlocks are generally more popular on horde. Rogues are relatively unpopular on PvE servers.
---
Better late than never! However backtracking to earlier zones (for copper ore) might be a timesink.
---
Perhaps start an alternate character with gathering professions? That way they can kind of be in synergy with one another, and you get a break from the warrior levelling process to boot.
---
Any alternative solutions working for you guys ?  
---
An addon or smth
---
just join a guild, no more
---
spam plus its fun :)
---
Go for DS talent in demo tree. No pet, sacrifice VW for sick health regen which gives you infinite mana via life tap and sick tankiness in leveling. When in dungeon grp, sacrifice sucubbus for +15% shadow dmg. Win.
---
I hope for atleast TBC .. could be nostalgia but had best wow experience in that expansion personally.
---
On Shazzrah it seemed quite balanced. I've seen a lot of allies and a lot of Horde in STV. No side seemed to be in the minority.
---
Also do these idiots not know they can just reroll if they want a fresh start?
---
Yesterday I put myself out there looking for SFK. No-one responded to my whispers so I spoke to a tank who spammed the chat and started a group.
---
The original group saw my spam and msged me saying "we are 4, join us". I stuck with my new tank out of loyalty. Eventually we did split into different groups, but we at least stubbornly agreed it might be better! :D
---
1. Alot of the crafted blacksmithing items can be bought by someone else and not requiring you to be a blacksmith to use it. 
---
2. I would recommend getting 2 gathering professions like mining and skinning. Save your mining materials and sell your skins for a small easy profit. That way you can find out if you want engineering or blacksmithing and decide later.
---
I play a warrior and I recommend going for engineering for bombs and utility in pvp and also bombs for threat/dps in dungeons or raids.
---
I tried the 10-day free trial I think during vanilla, my PC at the time ran Mulgore at about 4 fps... /sniff
---
I will never get why humans tend to play humans in a role play game...  The idea is to be someone else.  May be many people don't feel human in real life.
---
with those keybinds I don't blame them in the slightest.
---
Its because they're in stealth. Same as us Druids....
---
Your unit frames are misaligned. How do you play like this and not get a stroke?!
---
For me, "Classic+" is more attractive than "Classic" and I don't need "BC+" (or other expansion).
---
You could fly to Ironforge, it cost 50 bronze.  
---
And it don't require for you to visit Ironforge first. Dun Morog is like Elvine Forest - it doesn't have fly point, so you walk there from Ironforge.  
---
But tram is easier)
---
I realised last night, that WC itself is irrelevant.  Tanking WC runs is pretty much the only means I've ever had available, of trying to make other people happy.  If you want to interpret that as pathetic, you are more than welcome.
---
You’re not ? Maybe you’re looking for them but they are definitely the least played class. It sounds like you wanna be the least played class for some reason but don’t want to be a Druid. Just be whatever.
---
i love it, im polymorphing ppl when i am around them to waste their time in cc, but this is whole another level, it takes 5min for the boat to come back
---
As a player who hasn't experienced those expansions, I'd like an option where expansions would be released from time to time, however they'd be seperate games where you could transfer your character from older versions.
---
This way players can stay in the versions they like, and to be able to transfer whenever they feel like to change.
---
This makes me afraid to ask mages for water, is it really that annoying to get asked for?
---
Badges are not competing with raid loot, badges are competing with dungeon loot and there are not loot councils in dungeons and there are no items in dungeons that will take as long to get as a badge item (other than really iconic items like 1% ironfoe).  
---
MMOS are commitment but when you log in every day it should be because you're looking forward to doing something you want to do or something you've been thinking about doing. Not because you feel like you have to do your daily quests or daily dungeons and that IS a feeling that a lot of people get, your commitment argument would be no different if you made them repeatable quests. Solves my issues with them and still rewards commitment. But we both know it's not really about commitment, it's about manipulating people to feel like they have to log on every day.
---
you'll still have BG's and rogues are still literally the highest tier of DPS in raids
---
but go pvp server and stop being a pussy

The only thing I have faith in game companies for anymore is microtransactions.

Hey OP, I've been tring to get Nugs and Luna working with no success, I think I'm using either retail or private server files, where did you download them?
---
get me some galapenio crisps
---
OH MY GOD this is a memory I forgot I had
---
Yesterday i ran from Arathi Highlands to Hillsbrad Foothills to take the flight path. Upon entering the zone, i immediately see people writing ''lvl 35 allies ganking in 10 man grp pls help''
---
It doesn't surprise me in the least that allies are ganking 10 levels over, since they're all hot trash on Flamelash. Considering i was lvl 39 myself, i decided to go help them out, as i might be more useful than the average lvl 25 horde in the zone. 
---
First we annihalate them all in the Yeti cave, so of course they recruit lvl 45+ people. I start inviting some people and building up a good resistance. Shortly after it evolves into a straight up war, and 5 minutes after this picture we had a 20 man raid. 
---
It was glorious. I simply wanted to share this for anyone that enjoys wPvP as much as i do. This is WoW Classic.
---
im an 28 sword combat rogue. should i go back to DM to farm for the blue sword drop from the last boss? or just continue questing and grinding stockades
---
Horde forever, i just can't stand being cookie cutter goodie two shoes. Allso gnomes, i get to kill a lot of gnomes.
---
I see your "I can't cast that yet" and I raise you "disable error speech" option.
---
Then I get bored pretty quickly and enable it again.
---
Playing a healer, dual spec is the one quality of life improvement I genuinely miss. Charging an arbitrary amount of gold to respec always felt unfair to classes who have raid specs which are totally incapable of farming or killing stuff otherwise.
---
What i didn't like about TBC is that it completley seperated you from the old world.
---
No more of this island / portal to another realm nonsense. If they add new zones it needs to be on the same land mass.
---
Classic+ with as much PvP content as possible 😁
---
Let start with adding the epic quests for all classes instead of just priest + hunter
---
Kodo Graveyard legitimately made me emotional the first time I saw it. Played a tauren and got really into the game and the lore. Being an animalphile, the thought of our beloved beasts traveling here to die just hit me hard.
---
Is it an addon you used to be able to move the unitframes? I have an option to lock/unlock if I right click but I can't seem to move it.
---
Its okay... I have a virtual girl now. Shes a gnome and tells me im tall all the time though
---
Especially with the Honor system not even being in place. I don't remember vanilla to be that active in World PvP with the exception of Hillsbrad.
---

im pulling statistics out of my ass now, but aint 70-80% of all players still between level 1-59 still ?

Having never played WoW or WoW classic and knowing little about it, I think they should use this as an opportunity to go in a different direction with different DLC

If you go cast it just right on the entrance of Karazhan you can see under it and theres actually a big smiley face.

Most of them Questie tracks correctly.
---
There's a few it gets wrong, either thinking a quest doesn't have a pre-req like the one you mentioned, or not hiding a quest that is no longer available because you already did the follow-up quest, like the "Go to &lt;zone&gt; and speak with &lt;x&gt;" in cities, when you've already gone to &lt;x&gt; and gotten their quest. I've got the "Go to Stonetalon" quest in Org unavailable to me, but Questie still shows the icon on the map.
---
Most fun thing as a rogue is partying with 3-4 rogue and a cloth class.

Use cloth class (i.e mage) as a bait and stunlock kill the target and eat his flesh with your undead buddies.

Doesn't work. Played some minutes ago, was disabled, tested using the command again but no change.
---
I tried it for a bit. I liked it but I’m just not a fan of computers as a gaming platform so I didn’t stick with it.
---
Classic + for absolute sure.  
---
Unchanged classic a dead end. Expansions are history repeating itself.
---
If you're only getting 10-15k xp an hour solo then something is not right. 
---
What are your weapons/spec?
---
Classic with community driven content would be amazing
---
its literally doing absolutely nothing to how fun classic is right now, absolutely nothing

There are quite a few that let you. Shadowed Unit Frames is my favorite

Can totally relate, I stopped checking all my github issues since launch D:
---
Imagine being proud of the title king of pettiness
---
It's not really annoying as long as you fill it up. Remember your quiver gets bigger over time, and you really shouldn't be using that many stacks, whats the speed of your bow? That def. makes a big difference. Once you hit higher lvl you want the slow ones for multishot/aimed shot scaling, so you won't really use much ammo. I think in an average raid I maybe spent half or a third of a quiver full. It becomes second nature to fill up the pouch whenever you get the chance.
---
I always laugh at people complaining about pvp in STV.
---
Carefully
---
I’ve leveled in under 6 days on pservers and I’ve got 500+ days on retail. 
---
I’ve got 5 days /played so far on classic wow so far and I was away from my computer for 5 days. I’m level 42 (two bars in), I still don’t have my mount, I haven’t started tanaris, and I’m only like 1/2 through stv....I’ve got tons of PvP kills that will never be tallied...I haven’t skipped a quest—that I know of—anywhere (excepting starting zones)...I’ve helped my friends get their gear and we’ve farmed gear for myself. I still have to start leveling my profs too.
---
My group is planning on maybe being ready to raid by December...
---
Enjoy the breadth of classic a bit more
---
I was a Shaman back in time and I respect druids as valuable...  I really hate the min max attitude from too many players.  So I hope you'll just find a friendly guild who does not care too much for optimization.
---
&gt;I feel like the raw no addon game is played by very few people, and the people who say "Try without questie for your first time!" are being misleading since basically none of them are playing without that or some equivalent mod.
---
Of course I use it now, I played through the content countless times. The first time around though, I was in STV in my 30s when I started to use Thottbot. I am not trying to gatekeep here, but I can't look in peoples heads. So if someone says they have never played WoW, I'd suggest they do it without addons, to capture the feel all of us had when we started playing. If they don't like it, fine, everybody can use any addons they want, of course. But Questie changes the way you play and quest _fundamentally_, and once you have used it, there is no going back to "I wish I had taken the time and figured the quests out myself".
---
Took some getting used to since i first leveled a paladin and basically had no downtime. But I like killing mobs at a faster rate and being able to make your own water is really neat.
---
You spec shadow and don't respec until you're starting to go raiding. I'm healing level 60 dungeons easily as a shadow.
---
....do you only play one character?
---
I was with ya til dual spec.
---
Nah. The majority of players are 20s and 30s. At 49 you're still the odd-man out.
---
Nothing needs to happen fast.
---
They don't need to be at all, but in retail very well could be.
---
Blizz seem to have different standards for Classic in a lot of ways, which i'm personally all for.
---
So well put man!
---
"Casting another Far Sight while channeling a Far Sight will let you  "jump" your vision further and further ahead. With practice, you can  view anywhere on your continent with this technique. 
---
To do this, simply use Far Sight. Then, while channeling the  spell, click your Far Sight spell, and move the camera further. You can  move around corners, and far ahead of your normal line of sight.|  
---
Does it still work?

lmfao what the fuck mate, go back to retail cazzie

Where's the choice for no changes, no progression? Do not rape and butcher this beautiful timecapsule with additions. If it stagnates then let it stagnate.

Humans have imp sword/mace skill which is great for threat.

Okey. Might switch to Enginnering then insted of LW and just buy Devilsaur set

Fly, you fools

Like talk to girls
---
that's your opinion.. why'd you delete your post. stand by your convictions.
---
It’s definitely worse than disc or holy for dungeons.  But priest is strong enough that it doesn’t really matter until the upper level dungeons.
---
FYI if you only ever put 5 points into Shadow (spirit tap) you’re virtually 90% as effective solo leveling as full Shadow.  Most of the time you’re just Wanding anyway.
---
So you can make posts about how you are entitled to all dungeon locked chests on the official forums.
---
And would have it have a monetary potential without the playerbase screaming for it? Please.
---
i should

I guess being tight is better than being loose
---
Yh they were mostly running away when they weren't in a 5 to 1 ratio haha.
---
I should probably turn that off
---
He’s already got it!
---
the people who didn't want LFG/LFR back then were a very tiny minority, and now, a HUGE part of the playerbase complain now about how LFG/LFR messed everything.
---
So unless hardcore players back then can reproduce themselves like amibs and somehow became the majority of the playerbase, yes, it's bound to happen that many of the one complaining about LFG/LFR right now were among the one who f\*\*\*\* loved it back then when it arrived.
---
Something being slower does not mean it's useless.
---
New content entirely.  Do some alternate dimension shit ala WoD.
---
You'll be fine
---
As much as I would love going back to BC, I feel like the separate expansion server system would divide up the playerbase too much. I'm all for a classic+ system, although all I *really* want is for them to bring back resto druid treeform.
---
retail is trash, and the people that enjoy it are trash
---
.... do you want to completely restart all your alts every year after a massive wife?
---
It would be for the best, keeping the same faction. Honestly not sure if you can mail between factions in classic. Only other option would be a neutral auction house.
---
add things in slowly
---
And the guy on his left becomes the lich king
---
Classic+ 1000%
---
It's autism
---
That’s my attitude as well. I like killing these ogres, so fuck it. That’s what I’m doing for a while. I’m not getting xp at an optimal rate? Doesn’t matter, I’m still not hitting 60 in the next month.
---
Some of the content could simply be reused and retuned TBC/Wotlk content for instance Caverns of time and Karazhan.  
---
Its not like that would be very hard to do.

What would be tricky though is to make the progression and make it feel relevant.

not an addon

Youd think that yet majority of pvp servers are horde bias, so more people like playing orcs / cowpeople that say a dwarf or elf. (Dwarf master race)
---
If it wasn't an Epic store exclusive I might try it. Might wait until their contract runs out with Epic and but it then.
---
Blizzard said they only made it like this because they wouldn't be able to handle all the support tickets coming in asking them to trade those items to another player
---
Zoomer?

No point to learn both Bite and Claw on same pet. Bite deals more damage, but needs 10 more energy then Claw and  Claw have no cool down, so basically your pet will use Bite may be once or twice in one fight. And that "once" may use all energy needed for next Growl and pet may loose aggro. And resistances are always good :)
---
Even my fucking mount costs mana !
---
They are similar in concept, but have completely different gotchas of course. Lua is nicer and more forgiving while js is arguably more useful and supported by community these days. If you know one, you vaguely know the other (at least enough to read it), some syntax is a little different and both have different sets of quality of life features.
---
Doesn't really seem practical to start changing your clothes mid-battle now that you think about it.
---
I've played almost every single day as much as i can possibly play (about 1-3 hrs with work, wife and kid) and I'm just coming up to level 31. 
---
I've seen people talking about phase 2 should be in november - that's absolutely daft for a start, and you're suggesting p3 by december?
---
There are SO many people still in the 20-30 range, don't take the game away from them
---
That guy in the Steam comments complaining about how programmers taking time off to play WoW is bad, smh. When I take time off, I can do whatever the fuck I want. Whether it's to visit my sick mother or to set a new record for longest wanking session is nobody's business.
---
You work at the same place and have the same boss you had in 2005? I'm impressed
---
As long as i get 10-man karazhan i don't give a jolly fuck.
---
PRot pal got alot of QOL in tbc. Was kinda crappy in vanilla unfortunately.
---
Depends on when you do it. Back when I did it they were almost a gold each on my server. I'm not paying that. Finished the axe at 37 solo grinding the elementals, Corpsemaker was fine until then.
---
This is gold

Yes but cheetah was so.. awesome, but i know it didnt make much sense as malfurion has those 4 forms on his gear:
---
Bear (claws)
---
Cat
---
Raven
---
And bambi.
---
But i just like cheetah more and after a long time in bambi i finally found out i could go back to cheetah xD 
---
I mean.. its the fastest animal so why not
---
No, but there is an added threat component tied to defensive.

Dire Bear form bumps their mitigation capacity up quite a bit. Before then it's not great, it's basically like a mail user so around 35-40% mitigation.
---
Thats not how my orcs look. I hate, hate, hate, hate the new models!
---
On the spot would never play again if they deleted my character. After i grinded a month to 60. Wouldnt mind a bc server. Can also say if they made a bc server and made you reroll from 1. I also would not play it.
---
Expansions. I really want to play WotLK.
---
Rogue lockpicking question, I did the poison quest in westfall and didn't level my lockpicking on that box to 125. So how do I level my lockpicking past 100?
---
&gt;squishy cloth boys
---
In MC epics and with the talisman, oneshotting you with PoM+pyro regardless of whether they're in the deadzone or not. 
---
The PVP/PVE gear separation only happened in TBC, PVE gear was far superior for casters in Vanilla. If they get that much of a head start gear wise, it won't be hunting squishies, but rather minding your own business, then getting sheeped and eating an overpowered double pyroblast. The 3 minute mage was as much a staple of Vanilla PVP as the Frost AoE is now in classic PVE.
---
huh.. why is it mirrored suddenly
---
If this isnt low effort, I dont know what is
---
Most people who clear the dungeon kill the mainboss for the loot, and only kill the OPTIONAL BOSS if a person needs that specific loot from them.
---
I'm going to copy paste a bit when I replied to someone else about the negative effect daily gold has on the game too - "It also has a negative effect on the economy by handing out so much free gold which for most players removes any incentive to go out in the world and earn money for repairs or consumables that you might need, instead of exploring and finding your own niche spot in the world to farm or fighting over the more popular spots you just do the same daily routine over and over again."  
---
If that's what you like, fair enough, but it's one of the things many people including me wanted Classic for, to get away from that routine nonsense. I love reputations and will grind most of them to access recipes and rare items, I don't need daily quests for that.
---
Not going to lie this is me
---
Besides the crocolisks with Lazer eye beams and rocket launchers, of course.
---
My weapon right now is way too fast and multi makes me lose the auto attack while arcane doesn't.  Obviously to do high damage you should use multi between auto attacks and be out of mana like any other class. But to be honest right now im exping as BM and a simple sting is more than enough since my pet does a lot of damage.
---
Sadly, I'm not aware of one. I do understand what you mean by a big chunk of the community not liking add-ons though. That being said, it is important to learn the ins and outs of your class in classic, more so than any other version of this game... Imo. So, Atlas loot tells you what items exist and where to get them, with that, you could easily determine which items are best for you.
---
it honestly doenst matter. BT doesnt do a lot of damage anyway, its a pain in the arse to all casters, with the constant knock back. Thats what its therefore. So you can shoot away and get ranged while they are constantly hit with its really high attack speed. Even its white hits cause knock backs.
---
You prob dont need both, but if you are using it to grind, then you'll struggle to keep aggro. 
---
In all honesty, you dont need a cat and wolf, if another hunter in the raid will go wolf.  SoH is a great pet too, as it can stay ranged. 
---
But I'd 100% get a tanking pet for grinding. Turtle, Gorilla or even Bat. They are all sick at holding aggro and have huge armor anyway, so can take a beating, while you shoot and FD to drop aggro. 
---
BT is basically used to just knockback casters spells, so armor/stam would be better over say Claw. Bite is a must.
---
Oh, i didnt realize it was for malfurion. I always thought it was because travel form icon is a hoof, so they made it into an animal with hooves. Though that makes sense
---
Yes, it should.
---
Druid forms dont scale in vanilla either You just get better bear form at lvl 40 that replaces old one.
---
I literally got trapped on the zep because the loading screen took too long and I'd only get like 3 FPS in org or IF. Has to ask a friend login and ride the zep for me when I had to cross continents and just never touch the capital cities
---
I don't know man. Sounds good, but you basically split the classic community with not adding many, BCS I think classic servers without change need to be always available.
---
It does. Go ahead and test it in classic. The damage scales for a few levels after you get a spell.

Anyone have anything to try I can't get add-ons to work? I've tried reinstalling and making sure the folders are right but no luck so far there's no button for add-ons where it would normally be
---
I did just grind most of my lvls starting at about lvl 20. I´m now lvl 46. I Love it :D
---
I think Classic + could be so cool. See what could have happened if the game kept all the community favourite features and see how the game would evolve in this age. Compared to how retail evolved it would be nice to have a almost "hardcore" wow experience and a casual wow experience provided by classic and retail respectivly . Would like to see them grow seperately and differently.
---
Also didnt know that sub reddit existed
---
No- Retail is fucked for me since WotLK but 1005 fucked with Cata.  
---
Not going back, they cant fix it.
---
Is there a way to downrank healing spells on healbot continued addon, or should I be using a different addon
---
I hate the M+ eliteist thing since apparently I have no IO score. Well how the fuck do you get a IO score if you aren't accepted into any groups and when you run your own you sit for 3 hours in a group finder and go to bed since the tanks would rather roll with the high IO crew.
---
Tabard is the answer !
---
I just really wish for a Classic version of Karazhan. The place is absolutely breathtaking and probably my all time favorite place. So much lore and detail!  
---
I would also like to see a finished Hyjal and if i dare to say - The Emerald Dream!
---
Legend has it, he still requires help.
---
Hi guys, hopefully this question wasn't asked before. I tried to look it up here but did not found anything about this topic.
---
I play an undead warlock, at the moment i'm specced destruction for grinding reasons.
---
I had a nearly complete set of "fiery wrath"-items (+fire spellmg), but did not notice any differences in my dmg output with fire spells (especially Hellfire and Rain of Fire. The dmg numbers did not raise. So can you tell me, is this a bug or do the dmg numbers simply not raise, but the spells do more dmg nevertheless? Or does the +fire dmg do not count for AoE Spells?
---
Sorry for my broken english, i'm no native speaker :D
---
Greetings
---
Yeah it's great having two mana bars
---
Try the twitch client. It's a fools proof way to install addons.
---
The classic + would be awesome or else classic with expansion is also very hype !
---
That’s the idea for you though.     
---
The idea for other people is to relate to their character as much as they can which is why they pick Human.      
---
I play a human Pally, mainly because I love the idea of them back in Warcraft 3.
---
I approve. Revenge is a dish best served (period)
---
Total War Warhammer 2 finally released a new DLC which looks so sweet. I bought it on release day but never checked it out since I was playing classic. Damn, hooked again.
---
Population doesn't matter at all, if the servers start to feel empty they can simply start merging them. 
---
And why are you in such a rush, how long have we waited for the classic experience. I knew this would happen, people rushing through the content and literally only looking at the numbers and craving bigger numbers. Slow down, enjoy, make an alt or 2 if you've run out of content in your main, read the quest text, explore just for the views, take some screenshots, make a pvp video, help some low levels with their elite quests. Slow down lol
---
I highly suggest not looking up too many Easter eggs. There are a ton in the game and it's always fun to find.
---
You don't have the Ironforge flight path by default as a human, you'll have to use tram to get there for the first time
---
I'd love to play classic with some mix of tbc/wrath talent trees,  some gear adjustments and a difficulty pass to offset the power creep.  It would be a different game/servers to what we've got though.
---
Id like to see Classic+ and a separate TBC server cause TBC raiding is so good.
---
Oooh lol here I am i didnt realize what that travel form icon is for 120 levels! Lol xD xD and i called the druid my main.. shame on me. Hahaha
---
Nope. Retail is like a completely different game and changing a few things doesn't bring the MMORPG feeling I want. Let retail players be happy with retail, I prefer classic.
---
Hhaa yeah they got a long aggro range, but as i said if you keep paying attention you can avoid them. I aggroed them so i know they cna be hard to avoid but at the same time I was just running along the road wthout even paying attention to the sides at that time.
---
Nope! 100% not interested in retail. 
---
I quit when Cata came out, and only resubbed for classic.
---
Will try when I'm off thank you
---
Looks like the 2013 model. Might try and see if my 2012 can run it.
---
I had a hunch this is the case, of course i only see one side of the story.
---
Only encounters i ever have with allies is someone (usually 2-3) thats 10 levels over me just 1 shot me.
---
Any case what a shame you missed the ruckus, hope to see you in game!
---
he is actually second now, someone beat his record
---
Classic+ with the People who make expansions nowdays? No way, instant bfa bs
---
Well this is s much better answer than I was expecting than you so much
---
This is why u got banned, you "activated" the bot by handing out gold to multiple chars. I got banned in Legion and BFA for same reason for paying the boosters each week. unbanned every time but its annoying, basically their bot is just banning ppl that trade gold left and right. Glad you got your account back.
---
Thats not nearly as good as people say. Mobs have long melee range in classic versus priv servers which had minimal melee range.
---
Hmm I tried it, it doesn't work
---
Any thoughts ?
---
!remindme 11 hours
---
Yes but addons taint my perfect WoW Classic recreation so I don't want them! /s
---
Battle/Berserker generate 80% threat. Defensive generates 130%.
---
No. There is no rush. Any person too impatient for Classic should just go play something else meanwhile. You can always come back once the phase X hits.
---
It was like a pinata bro, every time we hit a mob a BoE dropped.
---
Yeah, spamming frostbolt is super intense
---
what he said
---
I only want it to go as far as wrath and wrath is the final point
---
Classic expansions
---
Are you that dumb?
---
&gt;Do I just accept that I am to move slowly and line up with someone's path in order to catch them?
---
No. you have your sprint, potions of swiftness and running shoes. Don't be afraid to use CDs.
---
Who cares? You're level 5

---
This is what it is all about! Glad you had fun mate.
---
So true.. SO true. Did a few dungeon runs yesterday and can definitely second this. Didn't matter that I marked targets, on a three mob pull you have one dps on each add anyway, and me running around them trying to get aggro but taunt has 10s CD! I tried marking, I tried not marking, I told them to dps the same target and I would still dps on the mob with the highest health, subsequently drawing aggro off me. Then I taunt that back, need to put some sunders on it just to lose aggro on the other mob instead! [MRW through the whole ordeal pretty much..](http://i.imgur.com/HUBUxCB.gif)
---
We ran it a few times, I got praise for tanking well afterwards.. Meanwhile I was just sitting there feeling relief that I could go and do some quests again...
---
The trick with it is to make the pulls big enough that it offsets the time 4 casters spend drinking at the end of the pull.
---
As combat. Cheap shot and try to be sneaky and gouge the blink. It's whatever if it doesn't work. Move asap in their direction after the blink. Sprint to break the first nova. Vanish to break the second. Blind to stop any ccs on you if they get a frostbite and try to cast something.
---
Strongly advice also having mind numbing on your offhand.
---
Alternatively wait til they are facing a wall/obstacle and open with AR.
---
Extra alternatively. If they are farming open with a frost school kick out of stealth and AR. chase with sprint after the blink (only thing they can do) and kill them before they can block.
---
Of course there will be discussions about the game in the future, because the last update is going to be implemented sooner or later, and people like to speculate/poll about what the future brings.
---
Nobody is being rushed, the phases have already been pre planned by Blizzard, and I promise you if you don't reach 60 before the last update it's either because you don't play anymore or you only play an hour a week. What comes after is always something people talked about even before Classic came out.
---
You only want us for our windfury!

How exactly does it work with the chest? I vaguely remember this, you'd get a quest, but you don't loot the contents, so you can lockpick it over and over again? The horde equivalent would be the chest on the ship, right? Or was it the tower in northern Barrens?
---
From my own experience rogue is a ton of fun in pve, solo, in groups and in raids. I did play mine on pvp server but most of my playtime was pve
---
Yup, got these dudes shouting on trade chat for like hours it feels like for 1 dps for ZF. I just asked what level is ZF and they said 44+, i was 42 and never been in before ever. They took me anyway cause it’s better than no dps lol
---
I'd really recommend levelling your fishing/ cooking skills it's well worth the investment if you can spare the time.
---
Games that don't evolve die. It's a fact. 
---
That are many things they can change or add in the future to make the game better or perhaps worse, leaving the game as is will definitely make the game have an "end date" for when there is no new content people will slowly leave the game towards new things. 
---
I understand the "Classic" mentality but nostalgia can only carry you so far. 
---
I myself hope very much that they add completely new content to the game that fits in the spirit of vanilla (sadly I don't think they will ever do that) but eventually something will have to be changed updated or added.
---
What I do is apply mins numbing poison. I then open with cheap shot and a ss. I then ks them before cheap shot wears off and then get another ss in. I then blind them and re stealth. Then I open with another cheap shot and ss. When they get out of that they will then blink, which I immediately pop sprint to get over to them and try to kick them. They’ll usually frost nova you so try and get as close as you can and then vanish out of the frost nova. Try and then cheapshot them again and you should be at 5 combat points and hit them with that FAT eviscerate.
---
Eagles you mean
---
Nice one. Grats on 60! I feel better now that I'm not the only one with a screenshot folder with 5000+ items...
---
&gt;The idea is to be someone else.
---
 No. For me the idea is to be me but with the fantasy of being able to slay dragons and orcs.
---
Yeah you're right. It's still definitely possible though
---
It's indeed useful, although I've seen maps like this in color too. Hrm, I'm pretty sure the WoW website back in the days of vanilla had a map of the world with general information about the leveling zones; you didn't have to resort to a third-party site like this. Although it seems like they revived classic, they didn't revive their old website and the resources they provided to the players back then.
---
Expansions.
---
Ah its you again :) 
---
Remember me? We met at SM joking about how bad using item set as names from blizzard games :):)
---
Greetings - Rasha
---
I actually haven't noticed it a lot on classic, could be that other outside sounds drown it out, but on retail its obnoxious.
---
I bet you play a gnome assassin you turbo autist. Your very existence is pure trash.
---
Sounds like 3/4ths of the server  population on Bloodsail.
---
Sorry, I haven't played for quite some time and I've never heard of tokens before.
---
I think I have an old character, that should have some gold. Do I get it right, that I can log in the retail version and use that character's gold to buy tokens to use for a subscription with which I can play classic?
---
Yep. Heroic mobs would one shot most dps, and only raid geared tanks could survive a hearing from 3+ mobs. That did that people stacked mages and locks for cc, though
---
Fixed to lvl60, no more levels. If there are more levels it will break how the classes are built. For these talent trees that we have, lvl60 is perfect. Balancing talents and abilities would be tho really nice.
---
wPvP zones + game mechanisms to give content.  Another zone like lvl60 STVietnam would be cool.  Instance based PvP content to capture towers/castles.
---
New zones could give more leveling options.  New raids would not give better but optional/situational gear. Some raids could need gear from other raids to make it doable.  Simple example; Fire Res items from one raid are needed to survive over fire damage in another raid.
---
LFG addon?
---
So this is why every alliance ganks lowbies like a loser.
---
When im high lvl im going to defend lowbies not kill them no challenge thats not pvp.
---
the classic expansions option is what i hope
---
I was just reading that layering is going away in phase 2 so I’m definitely starting to lean towards making the move.  If 3k feels crowded then I can only imagine what these 50k+ pop servers are going to be like without layers. 
---
Sulfuras has felt *just right* as far as population density, even when the server is completely full, so it’s seems pretty silly that they’re removing the layers considering how effective they are.
---
I accidentally shot a nelf hunter's pet turtle in the Shimmering flats. The result wasn't quite as grand, but it was a funny moment. Later I feigned death when a much higher warlock jumped me and they didn't know what to do so they mounted and ran off. Classic is the best.
---
As a ranged class, this fucking sucks.
---
Best we can do for now: go into interface options&gt;names and turn on NPC names, that way you can actually see mobs.
---
A whole lotta
---
I must be missing it. Honestly, I haven't seen a single interesting thing happen on this server other than one troll speaking in character on the zeppelin.
---
Exactly my point, people love TBC but it was literally the beginning of the end.
---
Is classic+ even an option? We only got classic because the fans dragged Blizzard over, kicking and screaming. They didn't want to commit resources to this in the first place. Would they put devs working on new (old) content? I'm doubtful. They might end up with like 4 branches: retail, classic, classic+ and classic progressing through the expansion cycle.
---
Yes 1 button: Arcane brilliance
---
nope, it isnt paladin.  the thing can't even taunt and it can't pull mobs back from range (you will miss your gun or starfire if you try pally tanking).  Also it's the only tank that has  a timer on it, you will go oom within a minute of combat.
---
Are you sure? I remember arriving into Ironforge as Nelf, and clicking gryphon master I saw option to fly to Stormwind.
---
Decent.
---
Giggity
---
Karazhan PLZ!
---
No I'm serious, it can be very helpful. I do it frequently
---
Blame your Clan.
---
&gt;So if they went back to challenge mode dungeons with cosmetic rewards that would be an improvement?
---
yes and no.
---
I would much rather there were no challenge dungeons at all. I am all game for challenging stuff, i just dont find the concept of "Pull as much as possible to beat timer fast" fun. Thats why i enjoy classic more than retail - i prefer slower, deliberate clearing to "RUSH IN CLEAVE PULL MORE AJPSOPEDHAPSHDFOAHSDOPH" that challenge dungeons/M+ brought. But at least if rewards are purely cosmetic it would help, yes.
---
prs06 shutdown because of jagex's lawyers :)

Classic +

Add:

-More balance 
---
-Content 
---
**-Quality of life that DOES NOT trivialize acquisition work.**
---
Example: Dual spec options are just stupid to not have. It’s good quality of life.   
---
Faster crafting and stuff like that is convenient but ruins the drug formula. Don’t trivialize the work needed to progress.
---
Well, it is in your comment...
---
Nice job, won't have to use add on ^^
---
i wish it would stay in phase 1 for at least 6 months. but i feel like blizzard wants to move things quickly to rake in the $$$$
---
I see your 'Not enough rage' and raise you a 'not enough energy', AND 'not enough mana' because I switched forms too much.
---
But you can't swim from continent to continent because of fatigue?
---
You are wrong. Flying took the world out of the game. Just because the world aspect of the game was not appealing to you does not mean it was not appealing to a lot of us. The word pvp you speak of after flying only is existed because low levels could not fly until max level. You are just cherry picking those chance encounters where two max level players actually fought it out because why not. The reality is that the pvp aspect of a pvp server became entirely optional when flying was introduced.
---
So one says yes and the other one no? 
---
If i check spells at [classicdb.ch](https://classicdb.ch) it shows me both the 'regular' battle/berserker stance and the one with reduced aggro, like /u/Ru5k0 said. 
---
I was offtanking sm the other day and i figured it requires are large amount of damage to hold the mobs. It "feels" like it's 80% threat in both offensive stances, but i'd really like to have confirmation on this.
---
Terrible for warrior and druid tanks. Dodge = no rage from damage = less threat = dps has to kill slower = healer needs to heal you more because the fight takes longer.
---
Unfortunatelly very likely
---
Except it wasn't like that in vanilla
---
Happened to me during Wrath while camping Arcturis with my Dwarf hunter. Man, I despised the Troll mage responsible. Made it my mission to search and destroy him in every zone possible. 
---
Eventually the dude created an Alliance toon and emailed me asking what my problem with him was. I told him about the incident with Arcturis. He said he didn't know that I was camping the bear and Blizzard had for some reason tied achievements into killing and looting spirit beasts (of which Arcturis did not even count). But yeah he tagged it first (and he sprang my trap with zero damage to the bear). 
---
Anyhow, about a week later, late on a Sunday night, I got a whisper from the guy telling me that I should come to Grizzly Hills ASAP. 
---
I hearthed to the inn, and made my way to the spawn spot. And there was this Troll mage looking over Arcturis walking around his slope. I quickly set out to tame him and bowed to the Troll. We have been friends ever since.
---
then we run out of mana becuase we checked if there was resource smh
---
Which server?
---
&gt; If they did a Classic plus. I would want them to finish everything that was un finished.
---
[Karazhan!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGeb0EYMWAE)
---
Zey get you at Frostblitz too, ja?
---
That was the single biggest failure of the wow expantions imo. Failure to utilise existing zones.
---
demo shout was never threat glue in vanilla.  if you think this should have stayed in you're just wrong.
---
The ashen ale rally was pretty fun. Aoe mages had it on lock down.
---
Classic + all day every day
---
lvl33 priest.   
---
have a lvl1  shaman sitting in Orgrimmar, disguised as bank alt.
---
ALL OF MY WILLPOWER goes into not starting her up.  
---
 ALL OF IT.
---
I know nothing about the hard stats but I'll say that I see warriors everywhere! Really surprising for a class that is supposed to be a total pain to level solo. Druids and warlocks are the least I've seen running around. I see tons of mages everywhere too. On my server is say mages and warriors are the most popular, just from observation
---
You really want at least two tanks in your static raid, and druid doesn't compete with warrior tank for most gear, so gearing up is much faster.
---
Why unfortunately?
---
[the whole Karazhan!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGeb0EYMWAE)
---
Sounds like irl sleeping lol
---
When was this? I am on grob...how did I miss this?
---
I'm looking at his stream right now and he has no nameplates on
---
I'd love it if content was mostly untouched but they make some slight  balancing changes here and there to bring more specs up to par. Like give paladin a taunt. Allow bear druids to use potions in bear form or allow them to use racial abilities while shapeshifted.
---
Maybe make some additional tier sets for other specs. Pretty much all tier sets for all hybrid classes are made for healers.
---
Maybe even work on Enhancement Shaman as a tank spec. I don't know what they'd need to be somewhat viable, though.
---
Not from undercity lol, If I was lucky I’d catch it just before the loading screen came back and jump off the zep into the sea

If you and mage are in the middle of nowhere, it won't bother anyone.
---
yea but, sorting by new ... i have seen count(x&gt; 10) threads about, more more more ... not fast enouth and so on ... i just want to slap every single of them in the face ... 
---
We are ?3 weeks? into classic ... and just right now i have read a post about p2 and p3 need to happen faster ... 
---
i don't get this mentality ... we as the community have so mutch time to simple enjoy what we have right now. 
---
my classic main, is 32 ... and i have been to just 4 zones for quest. and i know there is more to come. :D prepping myself to grind that frost sabler mount in Winterspring. Enjoy some old quests. and so on.
---
nope. Shazzrah-EU
---
I honestly reroled once. I never played vanilla, so at first I chose my class based on guides. I picked priest because every guide will tell they can do everything, they don't have any big downsides etc. But I didn't "love" the idea of being priest. So when I dinged 40 and got my mount I reroled to Shaman and now I know it was a good choice. Leveling is harder, but I don't regret it at all. The only problem I have is that my priest was on alliance, so I can't transfer money to my shammy.
---
Or maybe there is a way, using some Booty Bay AH tricks?
---
We asked for Classic, they gave us classic. Adding stuff that makes the old classic stuff irrelevant turns it into a separate branch of retail. Im not saying that is bad in of itself, im just saying that its not Classic and its not what we asked for. If you change Classic into that, then we LOSE classic.

Hence why good tanks were rare and always added to friends lists.
---
Hasn't arena always been specific meta and thus unbalanced for every non-meta class?
---
I was in same position, I changed to Luna unit frames and all works well. I really like zperl but, being a lock and not see dots timing was a no no.
---
Lots of people want to stay on the Vanilla game.
---
Hope not

How do you macro this?

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d3n1c1/shazzrah_eu_ratio_question/). 
---
Im using downranked spells on healbot. Can you not choose rank when you asign?
---
Someone has been doing too many lines of mana
---
Fucking sucks. 
---
The only thing to do now is to go in interface options&gt;names and turn on NPC names so you can actually see mobs
---
I read somewhere that they were planning tons of playable races, including Naga.  That would be cool.
---
They eat Elves?
---
that would be great if we get expansions in time interval of 1-2 years up-to lich king or cataclysm. that was the best expansions of all time.
---
Oh i want new raids as well, don't get me wrong.  
---
I just thought it may be a good solution to fight a coming content-drought, before the new stuff would be ready.   
---
&gt; By Wrath, threat just wasn’t a thing anymore. 
---
Just out of curiosity, because i never got to see original naxx: did they change a lot between OG Naxx and Wrath Naxx? Because the raid didn't feel misplaced or entirely different than the other raids in Wrath.  
---
Hell, imagine a Trial of the Crusaders Champion fight with Classic Class-Mechanics. That would be interesting, i guess.  
---
Or are Wrath raids entirely different, in terms of movement/skills/etc.? I can't really remember nowadays. Maybe it just had to do with the skills of the casual raider in comparison to vanilla-raiding? I guess it could be interesting.   
---
That's why i picked ulduar as an example, because i don't remember it depending too much on class-skills but more on mechanics, which were exclusive to the boss-fights.
---
I'm not 100% sure and I'm playing horde this time around so my memory might be throwing me for a loop. But I do remember always doing the tram route back in the day
---
Dual spec plox!
---
That would be Classic minus, a game where we gather all the stupid ideas...
---
If you want to go fancy, try

---
/cleartarget

/target [@mouseover, exist]

i didn't try it, but it should thank your mouseover target, and if you don't mouseover anything just thank. If you had a target before thanking, it should retarget that target.
---
Fact 1: Warriors ARE top DPS in raids. Just use simple Google. 
---
Fact 2: I said Warriors are the best in PvP when paid with healer.
---
Fact 3: You either did not play vanilla or were in low tier PvP and pve
---
nö.
---
That ‘Blitz’, ‘Reich’ and ‘Feind’ in 1 popup though
---
Man I can't wait until phase 2, 3, etc. and mages normalize out. They're fucking insanely stupid powerful right now with this version.
---
Server merges would be my preferred method
---
I feel this about TBC too. If we saw TBC servers I'd really like for them to permanently leave attunements in, never do the patch that got rid of most of the elite zones in Azeroth and dropped the mount level to 30.
---
I’m upvoting to spite you and your attitude. This is the internet. We love cats!
---
Love.
---
Cats.
---
Are you using a vpn?
---
I could spam arcane shot and multi shot every pack, and drink every other pack or so.
---
Or I could just hunters mark and viper sting and let the 5s rule keep me at 50-75% until we get to a boss where I drink up.
---
Not much difference in dps from what I've noticed (while running dungeon PUGs), and much safer since you're never OOM and don't accidentally pull more with multishot.
---
I remember finding this back when I was a kid. Really blew my mind.
---
Yeah garbage. Give it to me, my warrior will crush them to dust
---
I specifically wouldn't help a paladin in the situation since they would most likely bubble run or bubble heal, either way all the mobs sould instantly kill me for trying to help. Get some situational awareness and you wont die.
---
This only works with Activision meddling
---
I hate how no one is thanking private servers for keeping the fire of classic alive... like y’all shit on private servers for no reason
---
Yeh and staffs are designed for mages. I mean seriously who is high now. You all would want to take all your weapons. I mean hunter can wear spellpower gear too considering their arcane shot has the coefficient. Lets all just roll on robes too then. Because i mean why not, it makes the our damage on a skill higher!
---
I don't understand what exactly you're arguing against..?
---
WoW will remain in it's Vanilla state for a LONG time.. it will slowly progress through the phases and probably take 1-2 years before they re-release TBC, and then another 1-2 years before WotLK.
---
Classic is great and all, but 1) far from perfect and 2) by the time they decide to move into TBC even people like you and me who don't have much time to play (I'm only lvl 25) will have done everything there is to do in Vanilla and the game will have enteted a stalemate. TBC &amp; WotLK realms will bring back even more players and I'm excited about them. Let's ve honest, Vanilla doesn't compare.
---
&lt;TUG ON MY ZUG&gt;
---
&lt;SMOKE OKRA ERRDAY&gt;
---
&lt;NAGAS WITH ATTITUDE&gt;
---
I want to remain in the same vein that makes WoW Classic great.
---
Yeah... Sadly that is what every guide advices against. If you take two gather professions one of them has to be skinning.
---
Otherwise you will run into that exact Problem. No addons will help you there. You can get gatherer it tells you where nodes CAN spawn. But it won't tell you where something actually is right now. Only possible spawn locations
---
Help! Playing as a hunter troll.
---
Whenever I level up and then go to a class trainer my skill requirements for the next skill to level have increased the same amount as well. I haven’t been able to train a new skill since 12 and I’m now 18. So when I was lvl 16 it said required 18 for next skill, now that I’m 18 it says required 20.
---
What am I doing wrong?
---
Either will always have a raid / group spot. Rogue has the highest melee DPS and will be sought after. Play what you like more and don’t worry about the groups.
---
You're actually retarded lol,  I want a classic that is capable of looking at itself and saying "ya know what,  we weren't actually amazing at designing video games back then and can make this objectively better in a big way without costing anything" and I guess I just don't have enough crayons to explain to you why that's very obviously the best way forward, and what will most likely happen
---
I would take it. It you're hunter you have to get the money for ammo.
---
I’m gonna go with Option 3. Man Wrath was just too damn good.
---
No they post they should stop because there where too much posts. Not because they disagree with the classic+ discussion. Man comon. Even if not. The point stands that a lot of this classic+ posts get to frontsubpage. And why would they when everybody hates them? Just as we where talking there came a new one that asked people what the favorite path for people would be. Mostly classic+ is upvoted. Its a highly popular theme here. Doesnt mix with your 90% view at all.
---
Zygor has this feature
---
Escape from Gold was my first Dunkey vid
---
I remember watching Asmongold in beta and he actually said that both using a shield and using defensive abilities was pointless because it did less damage.
---
Yes. Far sight has always worked like this.
---
I was in the Crossroads Inn earlier and saw about 10-20 people in there. I would have a definitive number but I didn't bother counting and every time I'd look at my other monitor and look back there would be more people inside. It was so nice to see.
---
What's the fucking point of having 30-40 yard range spells if I can only effectively target mobs at a 20 yard range? Just change it to only stay 20y on player nameplates if pvp minigame players care that much about it
---
I'd also like aoe and frost nova toned down so that aoe grinding dungeons becomes rare.
---
no outland pls. never liked the atmosphere in that zone.
---
I couldn't agree more. I feel a tiny bit of stress and worry from everyone talking about 'what comes next' because I fear that Blizzard will feel like they need to take action and add content (which logically would be TBC).
---
I feel like Blizzard is smart enough to know that they need to take it slowly if they do anything at all.
---
I really want a long time of simple, vanilla WoW, without any changes other than content added that belongs to vanilla WoW.
---
It happened to me before when TBC came out; I wasn't ready yet and while everyone moved on to the new content, I felt left in the vanilla world without friends.
---
Thanks, i'll give Luna a try.
---
Wasnt "raid difficulties" just setting it to 10 man or 25 man? I really liked that system. It's a lot less intimidating to start raiding when you can 10 man it haha.
---
And honestly the dungeon finder didnt start bad either. When it first launched it just grouped you but everyone still had to fly/walk to the dungeon and it was only your server if I'm remembering correctly.
---
Cross server started fucking everything up, and then instant tele to the dungeon was the nail in the coffin.
---
Thats... what i was saying?
---
Exactly, don’t burn yourself out people. Take it slow and enjoy the game you waited so long to play. Unless your fun only comes from end game content. But then don’t complain you’re out of things to do.
---
Big WF crits you mean.
---
Yes because you are double ass you fucking mongo. HOLY SHIT ROFL XdddDdDddDddddDddDd
---
Its because level 55 waters dont get added till DM
---
I was killing satyrs and every few satyrs this rogue would pop out of stealth and be like “really dude?”
---
He was literally fucking invisible. I had no idea he was sneaking up on anything, what the hell am I supposed to do
---
Can stream with a delay - honestly dont know why people don't do that when they're getting stream sniped.  Put a 5 min delay in and bewm no more stream snipers.
---
But to be honest I have a problem with the whole "I'm gonna give away my location and status in game in real time and then blame OTHER people if they use that information to gank me" attitude of streamers.
---
I remember in retail vanilla, Ironforge was used as actual hub over Stormwind for Alliance. This was because it was much closer to the harbor to Kalimdor (Menethil). In later expansions, Blizzard "forced" Stormwind being the capital by putting the harbor there. I play Horde, but I am curious, is this still the case? The only reason to go to SW back in the day was to grad the Ony/Nef buffs...
---
They killed world pvp on retail?
---
No he should have kept it and sold it later.
---
Yeah I get like 15 hours a week maximum so only level 31, I'm gonna get 60 in a month, maybe two, but I don't want expansions or even phase two before the end of the year to be honest
---
I'd want a Classic+ that preserves the community-centric aspect instead of the microtransaction fast-food like retail we have now
---
&gt; There is no way to get what your'e asking without it f*cking up classic.
---
Classic+ or Classic TBC would be on new servers with character copies, not replacing Classic Vanilla.
---
The fact is, something will change eventually, whether it's in 2 years or later.
---
At the very least, they would do what private servers do and open *FRESH* Classic Vanilla servers that the vast majority of the active population would move to.  But a lot of us would rather the new servers have new Vanilla-inspired content that we could enjoy for potentially years to come.
---
They should just apply the OSRS way forward and have everything community driven by only allowing it if more than 70% vote yes.
---
I think Blizzard needs to handle the entire Classic+ situation very delicately. Instead of adding new zones etc. they should put their focus on adding more horizontal content into all zones:
---
Imagine walking through Winterspring and suddenly there is a small camp of dwarves where you can pick up a new questline. Having more long quest lines explaining the lore of the world would indeed be in true nature of Classic, thus be Classic+. Classic is all about the lore in the world, and the characters who inhibit the world.
---
 Classic expansions i wamt tbc more than anything more than classic even
---
&gt;Also we don't have retail, because retail is more vapid than most f2p phone games nowadays with all the unique shit hidden behind the store and RAF now. Dont pretend like the games have equal ground.
---
Times have changed, Blizzard have changed, Retail is the *best* example of exactly how Blizzard will do A modern MMO, no? You don't think it will go that way again?
---
Amen, "letting the community decide" is what got us into retail mess to start with.
---
Dickschuppensabatons sound...shmexy!
---
ATLAS had this for awhile. Logging into a city on launch your sound drivers would crash because of all the snoring of all the players then the hundreds of sleeping bodies on the stairs and buildings would crash the game after 30 seconds and your GPU would cause a house fire.
---
I can only get so erect
---
Seems like a potentially great tool, although just from looking, I'm inclined to believe the data is not good for low pop servers
---
Being the bael dun scum that's ruining mulgore with you, you stubby thing.
---
Expansións + anyone ?????
---
Because you killed someone afk?
---
I used to have an addon way back when I played for healing that was basically just colour coded squares for health bars and I could left click on them to cast my most used healing spell, right click on them to cast the second most used one and mouseover names while casting my lesser used spells from keybindings to fire those off.
---
Does this ring any bells to anyone and does it exist for classic?
---
Van Cleef dies
---
Look at the filter of the training menu, top right. It's propably set to not show available (green) skills, but only unavailable (red) ones.
---
Good thing intelligent people are calling for more content once it's gone
---
No it's not, you're arguing semantics and against basic math.
---
WotLK was significantly better than TBC
---
I want TBC in vanila you can play only 4 classes
---
Just buy a wand. Do more damage than actually casting. 
---
At least that's the case on warlock leveling. Basically auto attacking wand class with a few dots.
---
No.... i know its hard to understand other people, but some people are way more practical. They want points to fight.
---
Can we leave dungeon finder out, but put in BG finder (once they're actually in).
---
I think the ‘best’ solution is that your character can get duplicated and can (exclusively) move to a TBC server. This way people can stay in Classic with their character ánd continue in future expansions if they like.
---
The population size doesnt really matter.  It just requires you to take more than one sample at different times of day.
---
A mixture of B and C.  
---
Start the Classic+ in terms of voting on things after Naxx. Do bring TBC and Wrath, but without flying (rework the zones), without the dungeon finder and such. Definitely develop into a new direction afterwards, scrap Cata onwards.  
---
Most importantly anything new Blizz makes should be voted on and then when they made it voted on again to make sure it really is authentic and belongs into the game and that people want it.
---
Yes playing exactly how I want makes perfect sense.
---
This was fixed in vanilla
---
&gt; Is there anyway I can respec to correct the stupid stun talent again without paying 5g?
---
no
---
If it's your PTO why would they care why you take it?
---
None of those. 
---
Original Cut content like azhara battleground could be nice, and maybe hyjal raid because it was originally intended for classic. 
---
But other than that, treat it like WoW 1, a game that is finite and does not expand.
---
Treat BC as WoW 2. I do not appreciate additions that nullifies all endgame content.
---
Yeah you can’t really put that on anyone but yourself..
---
BC would be possible, but its probably not possible to do anything past wrath without redesigning encounters. Even wrath is a stretch since raids had more meaningful innate mana regen (replenishment?) rather than multiple use potions. Tank cooldowns aren't going to synch up with boss mechanics and you'd be missing major cooldowns like bloodlust. 
---
By this I mean you couldn't just scale all the HP and abilities down in proportion to one another and expect to kill the boss. DPS checks and fights for survival would need to be relatively more forgiving. It's hard to imagine doing a fight like Lich King with vanilla class design for example.
---
But that’s my point. They’re not doing it because a lot of people asked, they’re doing it because of the money they make from it. 
---
Regardless, my original point was letting players dictate key game development decisions has always ended bad in wows history.
---
Yeah but atleast it's stabstab afk and not drinking mana afk
---
Jeez calm down, it'll be a very long time until the future of classic becomes relevant. 
---
Also many people do care about what happens with classic when that time comes, don't tell them to stop talking about that just because you don't.
---
The classic team has proven to be very dedicated to an authentic classic feel, so they'd handle a classic+ well. Also if classic doesn't massively to down in numbers after the hype is over, either classic+ or tbc is certainly going to happen.
---
They fixed it before 1.12 back in the day so it should be fine in classic
---
Did you read the last sentence of my post? :)
---
yeah it was, they fixed it before 1.12 - i don't remember exactly when.
---
yup, no rush, I'm level 4 with about 3 days played. Loving it, taking my time, doing quests running instances. 
---
I hope to get to level 60 by Mid October, and get suitably geared by end of Oct for raiding MC. dont want to rush things. 
---
Then I want to get an alt up to 60 by Xmas, hopefully.
---
the best part of the endless mage spam is that their class buff books are selling for like 4-5x the price of everybody else's
---
$$$$$$$$
---
you can ask the rogue trainer where to go to train your lockpicking at your current level.
---
And no goddamn flying. Flying kills wpvp.  TBC Classic and Wrath Classic yes, but no dungeon finder and NO FLYING.  
---
They'll have to rework some zones and things for this to work properly, but that's worth it.
---
You realize everyone is looking at your life and mana as the reason you clearly didnt 1v1 this person right? Like this kid was probably afk you got him to 20% then he started running when he got back.
---
Yeah. Kinda. We just can't get away with calling everyone past e5 a sarge.
---
Could it be that you have filtered only unavailable (red) skills? I’m not sure if this is possible
---
I suppose, I'm not very good at reading up in the comment chain when someone replies to me.
---
not a bug, working as intended
---
there was no 1.13 until classic came out as 1.13 last month, so... yeah.
---
Well what i heard from vanilla players is that the meme is the Paladin wants it but it just goes to whoever Hunter still doesn’t have it
---
Yea fat fingered that on the phone, didn't even notice
---
That's what I meant when I said that they don't care for the game. Some (many it seems) enjoy the hype and what game it's about doesn't matter. They just want the hype aspect of community and Classic hype has now subsided so they're anxious for the "next big thing".
---
In theory, Crusader, but that will cost over 100g and you'll replace WW axe pretty easily. Aim for a +5 damage, shouldn't cost more than 10g max. No real reason to spend the gold to enchant it unless you already have your mount money and more to spare, though.
---
Don't think so (only like 95% sure). I think you stay in layer B until you join a group in layer A
---
As long as you're under 70 I don't think age matters a whole lot here.
---
Is this some kind of burn by blizzard? "You feel normal, you didn't have any battle net friends to begin with"
---
Agreed, there's something about the roads not always being safe from mobs. Fight or flee instead of "Nah lul, fly away"
---
this is the rite of passage every time you switch continents on stalagg
---
I'm not a fan of westfall personally, but yes it's about time you start a "second" zone like westfall/loch modan/darkshore.
---
Yeah teleport needs to go away. Hopefully they keep it out.
---
When listed like this I like the classic + model. Sort of a best of both worlds
---
Is the Weather-Beaten Journal available in classic? The one that teaches you to track pool of fish
---
This subreddit has turned into complete dogshit.
---
r/nothingeverhappens
---
You are thinking too little of green quests. If there are a bunch that you outlevel completing them becomes super easy. Of course most quests I do are yellow but I haven't turned down any green quests and I flew through my 20s just staying on Kalimdor.
---
I’m lvl 34 and I have quests to go to badlands and swamp of sorrows. Is it worth trying to go I those zones? I’m horde and the closest fp is stv. Seems like an insane walk.
---
I'd be down for classic + 
---
Classic is much more like a traditional RPG, which I love. But I do think some upgrades to the armor looks and ability animations would be great.
---
Classic wasn't even out and people were asking "What happens after classic". It's not that we want new content right now. Most people will be happy with the existing content for the years to come. But we want to know what happens after. Not because we want it right now.
---
And we've seen that it can work. OSRS isn't progressing towards becoming RS3.
---
no offense, but what do you know of vanilla tanking?  
---
UBRS is FAR easier to solo tank as druid. normally you'll see 2 warrior tanks.
---
Yeah I don't think there is a bug either. But if it did happen like that, then it's not intended to do this. But it was probably something on his side and not a bug in the game.
---
Standing in line and tagging it with arcane shot
---
I’d also recommend buying a few more stacks than your quiver can hold, as you’ll use these up before bag space becomes critical.
---
THIS SITE IS AMAZING!
---
I'm mainly a solo but it's my first-time play horde (always ally even since wow launch) so I was a little stuck where to go.  Originally started to follow Joana's World guide but it's now paid for and I don't have enough time to power level plus, I wanna take my time (plus queues are still a nightmare).
---
This will help my progression loads, thank you :)
---
Just give tbc. The content is already made all they'd need to do is port it. Pserver players have been dying for a good tbc server forever the demand is there.
---
Only intelligent reply in this thread.  Classic+ is inevitable and I savor the thought of the luddite tears to come.
---
This is the only way to do "true classic".  I'm can't figure out why OP presented the first option as a simple progress wipe other than to make classic+ the only viable option.  Based on the responses, it worked.
---
Six months ago the daily "let's vote like they do in OSRS" posts got promptly downvoted.  Now we have this thread.
---
Tbc and wrath &gt; classic.
---
Preach brother!
---
Exactlym the vanilla experience. The vanilla experience could be extended beyond vanilla tho. Itd about the experience, not just the content. I think most people who want new content want to keep a vanilla experience and not stuff like lfg, flying mounts etc.
---
Good.  Now if only they'd make player render distance bigger...
---
why didn't you say this to him in whisper? he probably wont see this post on reddit.
---
You should put the tram on.
---
I personally liked TBC but I understand where you’re coming from.
---
My leveling experience since about 35 has been me bouncing between zones, even with questie
---
Congratulations on your addon. I've always been curious of what goes in the development of addons. Could you share the resources you learned from?
---
this the guy that ended up getting mauled to death by bears?
---
Terrible opinion
---
There will be millions of them in the future. We better start to slaughter.
---
Pink is variant class. Paladadins and shaman
---
I’m doing that now. Got a 12 slot quiver and usually take 4 more stacks.
---
Fuck this is too real
---
Thank you for your service.
---
Only issue is it isnt a default channel that you join which just means trade chat gets spammed by everyone who doesnt know. I only knew about it because someone said something in a trade channel while I was in storm wind. Drunk me didnt remember how to join it on my other characters and I forgot about it.
---
If they made Wotlk servers I might start playing again. I never played Vanilla so I have no connection to it.
---
I don't RP
---
Fair enough but I don't like the divide created between PVE and PVP gear, players who want to do well should be encouraged to do both and gear from either should be fine in the other, just not as optimized. And the PVP weapons were what all PVE'ers wanted because there weren't enough weapon drops to go around, they let you easily contest the output of PVE players.
---
On my gnome alt I get no options when I click on IF flight master. And I'm pretty sure elves don't get SW by default either - hence the stories of some people attempting to run through burning steppes when they didn't know about the tram.
---
No problem ;)
---
I did maybe 5 quests in ashenvale as a horde, spent more than enough time in there doing the damn water totem quest to realize that place is shit.
---
How the hell is ashenvale 15-30???? I am struggling to find quests my level there (25) and all the mobs are like level 28-30!
---
Tough luck 
---
Gm rightfully won’t do anything for you
---
I like the idea of classic +
---
That's certainly an opinion
---
Sorry.
---
-- Disc priests
---
If no one has answered I'll give you mine when I get home
---
The hope is that the player base is divided enough over design approach that the ones who want the retaily stuff will just be playing retail. Blizzard has an opportunity to take two different paths here that, cost permitting, is worth taking.
---
No you chimp, look at RS3 and OSRS. It can obviously be done,  are you just dead set on keeping shit game design forever or some shit?
---
The idea of finally finishing hyjal is really tempting
---
you can cast scorch while moving? Shit i had no idea that was a thing
---
Just do what i do, pull so fast that people have to keep u with you instead.
---
/cancelaura Dire Bear Form
---
/cast Cat Form
---
Nice! And yeah, the speed makes a huge difference. I went for one marginally worse just so it would be convenient at some point.
---
I support this message
---
Panda expansion was excellent moron, maybe play it a little next time
---
I always limit fps, no reason to make the card run hotter than it needs to, and it saves on the electricity bill.
---
they should add a sandbox pvp server. automatic level 60, arenas, bg, earn loot through honor &amp; have a ranking system. that would be cool especially for people who don’t have time at all or the occasional break from leveling.
---
Sooo world of war craft smite mini game then lol
---
It's mainly since development would be starting now for what comes afterwards. Even if it's just story boards and etc, people would like to know what comes next, mainly because all classic content is going to be torn through very quickly and no one knows where we go from there. It is a tad early, but better discuss it now and possibly give Blizzard some ideas of what people would like.
---
Cast 3 heals, sit down, watch the squad start fighting the next pack, get up halfway through, repeat.
---
Option 2 sounds good, but I would like flying tbh, just not extra continents emerging from the fucking sea to make it crowded.
---
Nope, he died at age 73 due to cancer of the spine.

Presume typo? Haha. 40 right?
---
The pvp was literally amazing. Ur nuts.
---
I'm currently at work, when I'm home in 8 hours I'll PM you link to where mine are from - can't recall at the mo!

Nice! :)

&gt;The imp is the superior drain tank pet due to its higher base spirit value.
---
this single sentence indicates your complete ignorance as to how the drain tanking builds works
---
your life sounds incredibly sad.
---
PVP gear can be progressive, never removing the earlier sets but mounts and titles should be a one time thing, not changed each season much like honor rewards.
---
So that’s who the females gnomes flirt with
---
That's because not touching it is stupid af and unlikely to happen.
---
You jinxed it.
---
Classic+ all the way!!!!! It could follow the general plot of the retail expansions, but keep the Classic style gameplay and the feel of classic (players are not the "heros", they are auxiliary heros, and fight alongside the main heros (all NPCs) sometimes, but are not the "champions")

got mine too last night! Finally I look like I am lvl 20+

I cleared those with a mage and then it snowballed into 2 others and we spent 3 hours doing the damn stromgarde chain, holy shit.
---
wands baby
---
We have a "Fruit vendor" guild in Stonespine as well as an "Anti Fruit Vendor" guild
---
SPeak for yourself i was asking for TBC all time long as its my favourite...
---
Wouldn't that just be WoW 2?
---
Yeah, got that nature dammage snake mace from WC, 0 mace skill.
---
What’s your experience on Deviant Delight been like?
---
That was Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend. Nasty tale.
---
That's why when its something big I always wait for everyone else to roll and then I either greed or need based on that.
---
The 3rd one. I feel the point is to have it "stagnant" so theres time to see all the content that you have to kinda rush through to get max lvl and bis or be concerned trash.
---
Agreed.
---
Expansion. No question. BC and Wrath were the best expansions, and I would love to play them fresh.
---
Bullshit. There was a config option in the game. People used it. Blizzard removed it. No ToS breaking here.
---
Perfect comment. Just because some people are bad at differentiating fun, theorycrafting suggestions from community demands doesn't mean that Blizzard should just stop production until the casuals are ready. I haven't seen ANYBODY demanding for new content because the game literally just came out and only a small percentage of the player are 60, let alone completing raids.
---
I don't even know where this thread came from. I guess people aren't allowed to discuss the future of the game until they're ready for it?
---
Hello fellow warrior, the sentence of the day is: **"You pull it, you tank it!"**
---
Maybe a certain kind of people roll on RPPVP-servers?  
---
I have seen similar things happen multiple times on this server (Zandalar Tribe in Europe)
---
Classic+ would be interesting. While I'd love classic BC and wotlk, it'd divide the playerbase too greatly, we'd end up with every player playing their favourite expansion, which would all basically be empty.
---
Good tip and I try that whenever I can but gotta watch healer mana.
---
Im this comment, and i don't like it.
---
\*laughts in pally tank\*
---
Probably Bloodfang. It's evenly balanced too.
---
&gt;*Removal of Attunements (After putting them in well)
---
I have to disagree on that one. They have been a pain in the ass if you needed to replinesh your raids ranks, as no one wanted to do content they already cleared a dozen or more times and where no one needed anything from.
---
You’re level 49 complaining there is a lack of content, I’ve been level 60 for about a week now, I’ve cleared MC, and aside from 4 pieces I’m full pre raid BiS...I still play an average of 9 hrs on week days and 12 on weekends. You know what tho my engineering is at 270 and my fishing and cooking are at 100, also I got 0 pieces from MC...you are very wrong about a “lack of content” there is plenty to do and all bringing P3 would do it overwhelm people that are leveling at a average pace or behind....Go back to fortnite you impatient toddler :)
---
Exactly - I'm perfectly OK with having a "dungeon board", like a jobs board, essentially, with a button to whisper someone.
---
I don't think that Trade chat is a good solution, it's just the only one that exists right now.
---
I barely use my mount except for cross region travels can't be bothered.
---
Would go for the classic expansion set, definetly! WOTLK was the best expansion imho and would love to play it again and would love to be able to play my Wow Classic character in continuity on the WOTLk server once I hit lvl 60.
---
Ouch.
---
Muh freedom meter!
---
Mages are doing Gods work.
---
Meh, exploiting game mechanics is immersion breaking. I'm not in a hurry.
---
Retail has changed so much. 
---
They need to just separate the games. 
---
Fun pretty things with difficult content for retail. Im so used to retail if they changed it i wouldnt play it.  The story is meh and the raids are too hard for my friends to play with me. I like doing end game content at the highest level. Why bother on the lesser ones.
---
Currently im probably only going to play vanilla for the foreseeable future and if it dies or gets changed ill go back to pservers with my friends. 
---
I like that i can be as elitist and min maxi as possible and still do the hardest content with my super casual friends and it wont be an issue.
---
I think it's 3 warriors a shaman and a priest.
---
You're welcome :)
---
Also just edit the quests? To either be a different quest or simply give the player a flying mount that expires in 10 min and only used in that area
---
Never join a guild that mass invites, it's always a shit show.
---
/cancelform /cast Bear Form is what I use
---
I would love classic expansions, as someone who was too young when these expansions came out and only played on the big bro account i would love to be able to experience the wow expansions (while they were still good).
---
Can we dream about a world where blizz admits they fucked up wow and do something like classic expansions that after WoTLK turns into Classic+, a man can dream.
---
thinking about it.... no, not til Cata anyways, looking back I'm not sure there is ANY move casting spells in 1.12
---
Zul'kunda ruins with both ally and horde killing trolls next to each other is a tense experience. Its a bit like the balkans in the early 1910s.
---
If they go for classic+, 10 years from now you will start to see people asking for classic classic.
---
It’s pretty crowded in the evenings like most servers I presume.  I spend a lot of time waiting for NPCs to spawn.
---
I literally answered that in the comment you replied to. And in like 6 other comments in this string.
---
I usually do that and people start raging or pulling intentionally so I leave the group. Shit's tough out there. I do get good grps every now and then, shout out to all the players who respect aggro we love yall &lt;3
---
I'm 41 and I haven't had to use a shield except certain bosses, like Verdan the Everliving. If the healer is remotely decent there shouldn't be an issue.
---
Sounds like you asked them pre-combat and let them plan their downtime
---
I mean I love WOTLK...
---
Sorry to hear that, man. Try Zandalar Tribe if you're in Europe. Great server.
---
Bfa
---
Hey! As a lvl 39 you dont need a specifc healing spec.
---
You’ll do just fine with whatever. 
---
Also, I’d try and be open with being new and inexperienced. People understand!
---
Regarding the actual healing. Lesser ranks of spells provide less health, but in turn cost less mana. When starting your dungeon you can feel out what rank you need to use. 
---
Be straight with the group when you need a mana break.
---
Hope this helps!
---
I already do all of this. Come back with some non-obvious tips
---
Yes essentially. It has a 3charge on-use effect that increases attack speed by 50% for 30 seconds. Pair this with a strong level 60 weapon like Fist of Ormokk and swap back and forth when the effect wears off, or just keep rotating in Pummelers as the charges wear out. Cats will need as many Pummelers as they can get their hands on as the effect is incredibly strong for dps. 
---
Bears also use them on initial boss pulls to pump up threat so the dps can get blasting asap. They really only need one charge per fight whereas Cats want to aim for near 100% uptime during bosses.
---
It also has damn good stats for its level, but other classes don't use it because the stats are still worse than higher level items and the lower damage on the weapon doesn't make up for haste effect for someone like a rogue or warrior.
---
How can you turn your char on a dime in tanking if you are busy clicking ur spells at the same time? Its actually not possible..  Is like running the olympics with 1 leg
---
Really cool tabard
---
Only reroll mage if you want to farm SM from lvl 35 on. If you want to find groups easily, always, roll tank. But most of all, roll what you *want* to play.
---
Probably the only thing I wanted changed back in the day was Warrior shouts to actually sound like the character shouting like it does in retail.
---
If you dont like classic and think its shit design why are you here? I don't even understand
---
Na this just calls for lvl 80 talent tree like the golden days of Wotlk
---
Classic expansions, please. I want to play WotLK so badly
---
That one should indeed work, but I'll post mine that I use as well
---
 #showtooltip
---
/cast Bear Form
---
It sells for betwen 700-1000g atm
---
Well, again and again. When you see a ton of people doing quests, skipt them. If your quest tells you to collect 12 drop Items skip it. If you run out of quests kill stuff until you have quests again.
---
Wasting 3 hours on one quest is your desicion, don't blame others.
---
Lumping bfa in there made it sound sarcastic.  Apologies if you were being genuine,  fuck you if this is just continued sarcasm.
---
You’re gonna have to do the walk eventually. And quests are really spread out between 35 and 40.
---
Spend all good at argent dawn vendor...
---
If I apply a DoT with a spellpower proc (ie Spirit Tap and Spiritual Guidance for priests) would the damage increase last the duration of the DoT? Or when the Spirit Tap proc ends?
---
&gt;no dungeon finder
---
Can we please call it automatic matchmaking or something? A manual dungeon finder would still be an awesome addition.
---
Thats awesome.
---
 Thanks man.
---
Dude, imagine the cast of that 70's show but it's the 2000's and they're playing wow.
---
The waiting simulator
---
Naxx gear is already broken, they'd have to rebalance the entire game to add more without totally fucking everything up, and that would almost certainly have to include make hit and crit ratings again instead of flat %, which would screw over some classes that reky on level 30-40 gear, so gear again would have to be reworked to fill in the gaps (great time to introduce gems to power up under powered items)
---
I've spend roughly 50h of gameplay redoing all of my conveyor belts because they were not in a straight line when I build them the first time. And it really bugged me for all of the 200h of gameplay before that.
---
So yes, you need to be a certain type of person to get more hours out of games like this. People who don't care about layout and patterns build something once and as soon as it works, they are done. And if you play it like this, Factorio will have nothing more to do for you after roughly 20h. (What is still A LOT of gameplay for a game thats not even full price.)
---
I never experienced WotLK launch so I would choise option 3.
---
French WoW also simply translated yards to meters.
---
I kind of like the idea of classic remaining unchanged, like a gaming time capsule.
---
I don't know, [I think there's something shifty about her](https://vimeo.com/5241163).
---
I hand out buffs whenever I can, either passing someone questing or till I go oom in a town. But I've been noticing that I come across a lot of corpses while questing. So I throw them a rez and hope they didn't go afk. It kind of makes me feel like a paramedic. I help where I can.
---
Dunkey plays WoW classic would be a dream
---
While I loved some improvements about TbC, I hate Outlands. It's just a boring area designed for flying so you don't really have fun on the ground, populated with hard to kill mobs that aggro you from everywhere...
---
It's an excellent game that made some shit choices.  Smooth over a few obvious bumps and it's perfect.
---
Haha, that reminds me of something in Duskwood. I was preparing a Holy Fire, when I notice this Rogue sprint in on the mob (and I mean literally Sprint). When I managed to get the cast of before he got his first hit in he messaged me with a "srsly?!". And that was just a random zombie, not a named quest mob.
---
Fun times...
---
You cant bid on your own auctions and using a friend to post is a money sink
---
Frostblitzkrieg for when you want to take it quickly, but slowly.
---
In my opinion it would be a waste of time. You are better off going for a quest green or maybe buying one off the ah that is close to vendor price. DM won't give you any exp and farming it will take a lot of time unless you get lucky and get it first try. If it sounds fun and interesting to you, go for it, but if you want to be efficient at all, I wouldn't bother.
---
&gt;So if a group wipes you don’t get the instant leave because they know they can just re queue. 
---
To be fair, this is mostly due to cross server. There is a high chance you never see those people again.
---
I never tried classic Shaman, so i’m not sure if i dont like it or do like it. The whole nature elements theme just isnt really appealling to me. I think Im gonna give it a try though. I’m always enjoying the support classes in games. So shamans should be the best choice..
---
What about Dragonfang?
---
So Im leveling with a combat daggerish spec. I took imp ambush from sub as well. Currently lvl 34 and Im thi king feeling that my life would be easier with swords. Problem is really enjoy the whole backstab ambush big bursty style. Should i respec ( and find decent swords) or should i solider on and respec to clean out my build at 60?
---
This looks so sick. Please make a comic! 
---
On other relevant news, this boi is slow as   **f u c k!**
---
Yesterday I was in a group where the tank was speed pulling, all DPS was pulling and not letting the tank get aggro. I was going OOM  in every fight. I asked for them to slow down and control their damage and nobody listened. So finally I just sat and finished drinking after every even if they started a new one. They continued to do it the entire run.
---
How do windfury enchant and windfury totem work together?
---
1. Windfury totem NEVER procs
---
2. Windfury enchant and totem can both proc off the same hit.
---
3. One takes precedence but the other can happen if it does not proc the first.
---
And can WF or WF totem proc off the 2 extra hits? Either from its own or from the other source of hits.
---
My own opinion but some addons should be straight up banned. 
---
Stuff to make like all your bags in 1 inventory, telling you your stats, zoomable map, vendor prices, immersion etc are fine. 
---
But stuff like dbm, cast bars, lfg, questie ruin the game imo. It really takes away from how the designers wanted you to experience classic. 
---
Like enemy cast bars are a must for pvp, even I use it, but from a RPG standpoint it makes no sense that I would know what the enemy is casting. Questie is super convenient, too convenient in fact. People that use it barely read the quests.
---
They will need to change some things. I like Oldschool Runescape voting system 75% for something to go through. Every game needs to advance a little at a time. It will die quicker without any updates. Doesn’t need updates for a while just saying.
---
If this game is making as much money as it probably is, why not all 3? Classic servers, Classic+ servers, BC servers and WOLK servers.
---
I’m Horde and some ally helped me do the quest last night. They killed me after I turned it in but I still appreciate it!
---
As a programmer, I can only imagine the desperation of trying to solve a problem, going through countless iterations of failed solutions, and finally cracking for an hour or so to the point that you add this easter egg as it’s the only way to cope with the constant failure. Then an arbitrary amount of time later, you figure out the problem, which is then accompanied by a nervous laugh, and finally culminating in a /facepalm.
---
My poor troll bruder
---
Always heal your tank, tank is priority then yourself always. Dps can wait for heals unless you have some extra mana or low ranking heals that don't use much mana. If the tank dies generally everyone else will follow if it's a big pull or difficult boss. I've never played wow before and never healed. I rolled dwarf priest and I've been running dungeons since level 17. Level 32 now. Don't stress and have fun. Check out healbot
---
I don't use addons.
---
That’s how I see it too. And he’s even more pissed because I say cutesy things and call him Mr. Voidy.
---
I want Classic+ the most, but I would also love to get Classic expansions in addition.
---
If I have to chose one though its Classic+
---
C'mon it even looks like still image from S01E04 episode: "Wailing Caverns"
---
I got to level 17 thinking I could level up between instances as Prot, grew dismayed at my (lack of) progress, spent 1 gold that I really didn't have on an early respec into Arms, and promptly got my ass handed to me by some quillboars.   
---
I want to believe that I have it in me, but I'm starting to think that my masochism only runs as deep as a Holy Priest.
---
There are guides, which are useful when your gear resembles mostly best in slot stuff. Downranking mainly benefits from +healing and spell crit - otherwise it’s pretty easy to feel out which spells at which ranks make the most sense to use (general strength relative to HP of your target)
---
Well there you go then, you found it :)
---
Spirit tap ftw /laughsinpriest
---
What makes you so sure Blizzard would do a Classic+?
---
r/learnjavascript
---
i gave my best in paint btw
---
On my server, bars stack going for a good amount at iron (7s per bar). Copper is only a bit above vendor price and tin only a bit more.
---
People in the world first didnt have preraid bis. 
---
Fury in full preraid bis beats mage in preraid bis. Rogue and hunter also compete well with mage at that gear level.
---
Because of these posts i feel like im below average when it comes to leveling. When i read comments like yours it encourages me to enjoy the game instead of trying to keep up with the top. I want Classic to stay like this for a long time still.
---
It's #1. If you have windfury weapon on, the totem won't do anything for you.
---
And did you get any good loot from that **one** run?
---
It's May be harder don't know seem not to apply in my case but usually I think worth it...  I like to troll or beeing a cow and if ally a Gnome. So much fun to be underestimated by the look.
---
Apparently the tooltip shows the wrong armour amount

After an hour we got a mage who needs to run to badlands too.

"Do we do whole necklace quest chain?"
---
We finished up around 1:30 am, almost wiping on last boss because everyone was so sleepy and playing like shit.
---
Well they had a lot of opportunites to fuck up WoW Classic already and they managed to make the right decisions. Classic Plus is worth a shot, if it fails, people will unsubscribe and then Blizz will just roll out TBC.
---
You can still earn alot from proffesions, but its going to be low sums at the time. Ive been seeling different potions, and been able to earn 150g at lvl 47, thats with money for mount also. So just give it a try and see how it goes. Like other mentioned, engi is probably not the best one to make money. Would suggest Alch/Enchanting/taoiloring or LW.
---
Same with paladin to be fair.
---
Woa hunters are so f\*ing fast !  
---
Watching this as a lvl 37 Mage made me jealous...
---
Nice Ice trap btw
---
Accept all quests and do them as you move around. When log is full abandon those you are most likely to never do
---
You’re only noticing the LF mage calls because it’s on your mind and you’re aware of it. You’d be the same if you had thought you’d play tank, you would notice all the LF tank good to go! Calls.
---
Rogue is fine :) you will be competing for gear less as a rogue also.
---
There is so much they can add without ruining classic. How about rebalancing and porting favorite dungeons like karazhan? And if you want to avoid gear power creep give them item rewards designed for offspecs / cosmetics / etc.
---
Why not add a LFG channel?
---
As long as you stay within 1 level of you you can reasonably pull two mobs. The problem is people who don't manage zones well and end up being 25 doing quests that are 28-29 mobs and dying constantly.
---
Will this be fixed?
---
This. Once you go past that threshold there is no going back and the world felt empty.
---
Chuckles in pala
---
What I love about classic is the zones and dungeons have huge level rage. Sometimes you see some badass people riding through and meet a lot of people of different levels. 
---
Feels like the design is purposely makes you visit older zones to deliver something or wtv which is nice for new players.
---
I do the same but I embrace it fully and whole-heartedly! I have 8 characters, one of every class, 2 of every race and I train every profession. 
---
Shit this recipe needs an elixir of defence? No problem! I'll just relog! 
---
Downside: it takes forever to take level 60 for me    
---
I will always be poor as shit
---
Upside: All my characters will have basically BIS gear for their level because my cloth chars will just mail my warrior the good mail drops.    
---
I will experience everything in the game!
---
40 per mob
---
Classic + is exactly what blizzard should have done instead of introducing new expansions. Expanding the fame even more than its original playing field is the worse option for a game developer. A world that wasn’t even fully finished (mostly finished) then gets updated with a whole new continent!? It makes no sense really. what makes sense is adding to the already great world. Creating a new continent diverts all players into that continent drying up the original world. It just ruins the game. Keep it classic. Or I leave. And I will never ever buy a sub from blizzard ever again even if they come out with fresh classic servers. Either make it right this time or I’m completely done with blizzard. So far blizzard is doing a good job. Just keep it like that.
---
This is why I’ve been begging for changes.
---
Raids were intended to be hard, it against the philosophy of vanilla for raids to be absolute faceroll.
---
This game would be so much better with actual challenging end game systems.
---
For the journey to be so time consuming and difficult, it’s sad to see how easy everything at 60 is.
---
Luckily i roll mainly with clan members, the few pugs I've done this happen hasn't happened. The most was waiting for people to arrive, which is no problem.
---
Can understand both sides, if something came up you can't help it, then the other side you're wasting someones else time.
---
I would put you on ignore as well. The way you reply to someone asking kindly makes me not want to play with you.
---
Been using it for a couple of days now - no issues so far.  Hallelujah!
---
Players from APE etc played for years raiding precisely the same content... it's not surprising that its piss easy.
---
Players coming from retail doing M+ dungeons and hc/M raids where there are tons of mechanics with far more punishing consequences for failing them... it's not surprising they find it piss easy either.
---
The biggest challenge in WoW is levelling, that's it tbh.
---
I certainly remember raid mobs hitting harder in Vanilla.
---
That's more like "ass not fridge", just saying.
---
I mained mage for years and that's just being an asshole.
---
When I was there there we were 4 groups including us constanly spamming AoE with mages and warlocks to get the tag. Not a fun time indeed.
---
Never seen this post in my life u fuck off
---
I am not 100% on this, but I believe Hunter can solo more of Mara. Warlock can only really solo goblin and princess afaik. But I don't know which does it faster or better.
---
He wasn't using it to refer to the mental illness though my man, he was using it in the sense that he posted
---
If TBC &amp; Woltk expansions done correctly. What ruined wow was the 5 expansions content overlapping each other making the game impossible to play or understand. 
---
However, having TBC can be a good compliment to the game content. At least nothing will be changed except having another area that is accessible through the dark portal. For woltk I think same applies as new area is there.
---
Ok no memes or banter, but people SKIP this boss? Since when? You need to clear the entire cathedral before pulling Mograine, might aswell kill Fairbanks too. As a tank in their 40s, I've been runing SM for several days now trying to complete the Scarlet set, and all the groups I've run too never even said anything about NOT doing that boss.

Probably 1 meter and 1 yard = 1 azeroth unit of length. It doesnt matter if you call your one step 1 meter or 1 yard as long as it is the same distance in the game world.

I'm going to be that guy, but if your group does not feel comfortable with such big pulls why not adjust your play style a little? As a priest, your 10+ pulls give me anxiety just reading it.

Hey guys, quick question on the threat generation of battle shout:
---
I’ve been reading quite a lot about it and it’s confusing. 
---
From what I could gather so far:
---
1) battle shout generates aggro per party member buffed every time I use it - which makes it a great threat generator especially in AoE pulls
---
2) as stated here 
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/new-bug-battle-shout/249633
---
In vanilla there’s a “bug” which leads to the maximum of targets that generate threat when buffed by my battle shout to be above 5 - the bluepost stated that it’s not a bug and somewhere else I read that this was “fixed” in a TBC patch.
---
Can someone clear up what’s the state as of right now?
---
Does it make sense to spam battle shout for keeping aggro and can I assume that the more party members I reach with my shout the more threat I’ll generate?
---
Thanks guys, I appreciate it.
---
Classic Plus
---
I use /cheer on the quest mob and once they are dead I /flex at them.
---
The lack of understanding, and the amount of hypocrisy is what is truly *disappointing*. It is *sad* how much attention this has gotten.
---
People just miss the euphoria of Classic announcement, beta, anticipation, etc.
---
It's nice to be nice.
---
Mages are already broken and you want to give me a pet and 2 more novas that have ranged?
---
I mean im down for it, can i have Time Warp too while we are at it?
---
Yeah, and it's pretty much expected to do OSRS quests with a guide rather than figuring it out on your own. That didn't stop the OSRS community from keeping the integrity of their quests when an easier option was polled.
---
That's nuts
---
nope in aoeing dungeons blizzard obviously with 1/3 and frostbite go well toghether, its for the proc only for increased dmg, nova should break almost instantly due to dmg recieved. You blizzard for frostbite only, the dmg comes from flamestrike coc and ae.
---
2 or 3.
---
If the servers reset and they took my character away I would be done with blizzard forever.
---
Because they confuse "what if feels like" with "how it feels".
---
I think the point is that you multishot right after an AA, so it doesn't drop the timer
---
Your opinion is valid. Im just saying me personally
---
So instead of fighting the mob you’ll stop him, presumably die then he can open the chest? This seems silly to do, just take the loss; welcome to wow. 
---
Also pro tip for mages, you can fall from super high and blink when you’re right about to land to survive and take 0 damage!
---
I feel like onyxia and mc are just "5man dungeons" for a 40man group. Blizz got better as they went along. 
---
I remember mc back in 2005 being really challenging. 1.) There was no youtube or let's play. 2.) 75% of the raid had average joe PC's with integrated graphics running wow at 30fps, 10fps in raids. 3.) Mechanics were all word-of-mouth and everyone was new to this concept of raiding. I remember my guild literally struggled to clear trash leading to first boss because if you're too slow the core hounds will respawn if you dont kill first boss in lole 20-60min.
---
But now we know how MMOs work. We have the technology. This style of play is what we're accustom too. We don't need 400 fire resistance.... just play right.
---
According to this stat, Horde should be renamed to Forsaken
---
Classic plus where levelling and quest finding isn't a huge chore would be nice.
---
Really cataclysm vanilla is what I'd want, with more expansion content added as a thing you could do at level 60 for some reward.
---
Yeah I’d be cool with a barber too
---
Thanks! Love the idea of the addon, hope a lot of people will start using it.
---
Still no ass...
---
What I would love to see is them make the world more alive. Fit example, the ships currently are empty and running without a crew.
---
Also I would love to see some kind of advanced fishing where you can have your own fishing boat and go fishing offshore (something I liked in ArcheAge or Black Desert).
---
Rather than getting new Zones, I would prefer more life in the old ones :)
---
Knowing how blizzard balances (taking turns) really scares me though. Every time they decide to nerf something it’s nerfed into oblivion and buff stuff too much. Like we just need a little teeny bit of tweaking for some specs.
---
Wow... Lol i saw a different calculation and was confused by your 100% lol.
---
Bc i thought about that epic mount whos 100% and it irritated me but i got it! Thanks! Had something in mind like ~20 secs so it wasnt wrong! Happy to hear that and cant wait for that cute cheetah!
---
One of the cheapest things I ever done was frost nova a horde mage who was AoE farming, let him die then stole the mobs. Felt dirty and good.
---
 So my wife and I play together, and I love pulling little pranks on her. She things you have to sleep in a bed to get rested exp, and if the bed to full it does not count. Every time we log out, we are always racing to get to the closest bed. She is basically always following me, so I get first dibbs. Last night, she beat me to bed and laughed at me. Little does she know I was laughing at her on the inside.
---
Hunter has the same ability, right?
---
Yep TBC was the first step towards retail. There were some good changes but a ton of it was just nonsense. Giving Paladins to the Horde and Shamans to the Alliance was another step towards homogenization of everything.
---
Zone hopping is pretty key to efficient leveling. Taking 5-10 minutes to jump to a zone where you can keep doing quest and farming mobs a couple levels below you seems to be an overall speed increase, and certainly a QoL buff
---
This is true up untill mid 30's where drainlife starts outscaling wand dps
---
You should fix your settings as you want them. Then do not close the game through alt + f4 or something like that but prop log out. This should save your settings.
---
Tanks should not be using a shield in dungeons until UBRS really. It’s completely unnecessary and a ton of lost damage. You should have one in your bags and macros to equip for shield bash and shield wall or very tough pulls, but to ask for tanks to use a shield by default is very silly. 
---
Especially after 37, having another ravager will save you so much time and therefore reduce damage taken.
---
Acting as if horde skull levels arent invading duskwood literally hourly and camping darkshire lmao
---
Yeah I played Horde and pretty much lived in UC since it was the least taxing. I had a 60 who never really went to Orgrimmar. When I finally got my PC upgraded I did a lot of exploring since it was the first time I could actually move around in Orgrimmar without lagging.
---
You're talking about mechanics. I'm talking about the population. Ease of mechanics are not important here. The important part is what amount of the population is actually going to clear MC by what time. By all indication it takes the average player ages, because Vanilla is not actually balanced around the min-maxer.
---
&gt; All I am saying is that content development takes time, and "just waiting it out until it becomes relevant" aka talking about it once Naxx is out is gonna be too late.
---
Last minute rewrites because your old design was based on old information are extremely common. A lot of that 5 year planning actually ends up with 9 months worth of actual work due to poor planning. If you have time for a last minute rewrite, you have room to wait, and there's always something else to work on (like fixing bugs that will still be there if you do not).
---
You don't have to wait until Naxx. I'd wait until the average hits 60 and see what actually happens.
---
Iterative development and upgrading existing systems should be the name of the game for MMOs. The idea that you take two years to write a bunch of content and drop it all on the game to keep the oddly unhappy playerbase happy is a retail concept that a lot of other games copied, and I think it failed.
---
Classic +, but not for a loooong time.
---
BIS for all of Vanilla with any of the weapon types it has on it for PVE. Even more so if you are using a weapon your race doesn't have specialization in. It reduces miss chance greatly and is the only stat that deals with glancing blows, both reducing the chance you get them and increasing the damage you do when you get them.
---
Presumably yes. You probably won't be able to out-threat aoe abililities with demo shout, but you can still pick up initial threat with it
---
Not really about that is it though?
---
The game itself was great, just unfortunate to be released at a similar time to WoW and it just didn't continue as strong as WoW did regarding expansions.
---
"Hello Adventurer! Welcome to the town of Honeywood!" Oh wait...
---
Why not a bit of everything? There's certainly enough demand to provide revenue for blizzard (just look at the server pops at peak times, still insane) and everyone can have what they want. 
---
If I had to choose one though, it'd be classic+, giving us new yet originally intended experiences.
---
Dude let it go. No one is selling a good piece of gear in case it drops again.
---
Yes definitely don't give them any time to think about and work on the future. We'll just demand things later and want them instantly.
---
I do have the same bug (german client), could be a problem with an addon but haven't looked deeper in it right now. if my character is rested, it works the correct way.
---
Haha nice to know thanks!
---
Not happened to me yet although i thought it might but instead helped me kill surrounding mobs as they knew i was going for the chest, must be an rppvp thing, i dunno?
---
This is why i rather kill a hunters pet in wpvp than the hunter &lt;3
---
Are you counting healthstone, double vv, ss? Or something more? Are you adding the damage reduction as hp aswell?
---
Peak of WoW for casuals or people who were new, for everyone else nah, which is shown by wrath having little growth and sub drops
---
&gt; why would i kill some1 who is just trying to level/quest?
---
We're at war
---
log out then exit game properly, don't alt-f4 anything.
---
Just report them for spamming.
---
Jeremiah Johnson?
---
You can see the anger in his swimming at one point
---
Wanding kind of uses a global cooldown so it only really works with things that ignore the global cooldown
---
Listen, nitpicks aside, I think they did a pretty decent job. I played Vanilla hardcore and started hating retail towards the end of WotLK. I was moved to tears when they announced Classic. And I'm happy with how it turned out. It's not a perfect copy but it's good enough. If we can get that level with new Classic content.
---
That was how it was before we started queuing.  
---
The chat, when my group came to the boss room, was full of people going "gift we were here first" and so on.  
---
So we simply gave them right. Someone in my party said, openly in chat "Yeah, they were here first - form a line" and then we all did.  
---
They were like "Oh shit, didn't expect that at all". In a minute everyone had fallen in line, quite literally. When that situation had been solved in an orderly manner, everyone was suddenly very friendly.
---
The other groups helped with the boss fights as well, waiting a few seconds so the correct group could get the tag before joining in.  
---
It was great. I am happy to have been part of such an orderly decapitation-queue. Because that was what it was. We were forming a line to decapitate a certain orc warlord.
---
If I'm surrounded by alliance and see one take some extra aggro I'm going to kiss ass and take some of the heat off of them - hopefully seeing I'm not a worry.
---
If we are alone I'll wait till they rest up pretending I'm not a problem then when they get back to full imma light things on fire.
---
If they are lowbies I'll just dot them up no matter the case since letting them rest wouldn't be much of a help to them.
---
Though I never get the second treatment. They usually will wait until I'm low on health/Mana before jumping on me because that's how alliance roll.
---
Same problem, different details.  I keep coming up with stupid missions for myself, like unlocking all the flightpaths before 30, or maxi g out my skills before leveling up, or exploring all of the zones before leaving them.
---
They are the slowest solo, but in a group they level quite fast.
---
The one string banjo playing again I see. This sub has lost its meaning
---
Just right click on their names and report them for spam.  GMs will pull chat logs and they'll get in trouble.  Don't fret!
---
Great Stamina is a trap, for a general purpose levelling pet.
---
Spending 5 TP for 30 HP, 10 TP for 50 HP, 15 TP for 70 HP, or 25 TP for 100 HP isn't great. But beyond Rank 4, every 25 training points gets you 30 HP, 40 HP, 40 HP, 50 HP, 60 HP then 80 HP.
---
That 185 TP increases your pet HP by less than 10%.
---
For 75 TP, you can get 60 Resists across the board, increasing your pet's effective HP against magic by about 14%. That's just a general purpose distribution, you're free to tailor it for specific situations.
---
Yes I think that's the best. I'm new to priests myself (and to WoW as a whole) and I did a lot of reserach beforehand and kept hearing about the importance of downranking. But then when I started healing dungeons it made no sense to  downrank to me, since healing in bursts and then letting the mp5 start ticking seemed much more efficient. So I had the same experience as you did.
---

A pve hunter weapon, a pvp paladin weapon.
---
So deff hunter.
---
To all people saying it isnt hunter bis: true, but you cant give one handers (besides useless ones like zg set) to hunters untill all warriors/rogues got the stuff they need (read:never).
---
2 handers that arent bre are just stat sticks for hunters or pvp weapons(maybe different for horde, idk)
---
Yeah this is why I specified some of them. You will never go back to that entrance of stonetalon. And I would never make that supply quest in ashenvale as I move.
---
Meanwhile priest here, I just crafted all my gear.
---
I'd like it to stay as is but with the addition of seasonal Arenas and Rated BG's. New raids and gear would imo destroy Classic while new areas for PvP competition could keep the game interesting for much longer without having to introduce new items, zones or abilities.
---
I was one of those players asking for dungeon finder, it took me years to realize that it was a parasite than a feature.
---
Lol 
---

---
The damage has a small increase between levels at the start of the scale. Move the slider up and down to see for yourself. The data is taken from the game.
---
Interesting i thought they would be harder, haven't done any yet. I was thinking that would be end game stuff for me but turns out of more interest to me will be WPVP.
---
We've been raiding the alliance pretty hard since launch, and they never retaliate, until last night! OMFG what a blast, they finally raided us and yeah, i'm so hooked, Classic for life!!!
---
What seems odd to me, after two MC clears (missed first week in problems in levelup) is that either vanilla people were fucking SHIT at dps or the bosses are not tuned correctly.
---
Im in our guilds 2nd raid and in our ragnaros kills both times we got him to \~1% before spawns, with loads of mistakes, people dead. And this is was in 2nd and 3rd reset of server launch. Even 1 less people dying it will be easy no-phase 2 kill.
---
Sure, you could do that in private servers, but getting it done so early in server life feels odd.
---
Ps. Cutting your healers to half by any guild is a BAD idea. You are building a steady, working roster for AQ and NAXX. If you want to piss off people just to get fast runs in MC you are fucking retarded. I get doing "speedruns" certain times, but doing that constantly is plain stupid.
---
RIP Piana
---
I'm sure I'm in the minority  but I'd like to see burning crusades as a second chance to do it right.       
---
I want to see blood nights and the holy shaman concepts fully realised with unique animations    like they wanted to do 
---
Leave out the stuff that wasn't fun     
---
I'm sure there are other changes but that was the main one on my mind
---
&gt;I don't even know where this post came from
---
The literal [top post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d3chdf/how_would_you_guys_like_classic_to_progress_in) of this subreddit.
---
yes! When it went cross-realm in 3.3.0 though, that was what ruined it... or rather the sense of server community.
---
When it was all on the same realm it was easier to say join a guild, and just generally become friends with people. 
---
Idc if they keep the teleport or not, but you HAVE to keep the community together.
---
\--Burned out in mists, but was definitely feeling it in cata (wotlk was my fav though, mostly since its when I first had a max level char)
---
/#nochanges
---
The dude is just kindly asking for some food and you give him attitude. I would ignore you too.
---
TL;DR 
---
Pulled to many things because he wasn’t paying attention; expects others to help fix his mistakes.
---
It stands for casual, because you're casual tier trash.
---
At least you’re not me who immediately equipped it :(
---
Classic+ is unreasonable. I love it.
---
It definitely is better to tell people straight but shit does come up that's just real life. It's always courteous to make sure that you are as free as possible doing a dungeon. However like i said it's more the people who get really irate at the littlest things like going to the bathroom. If you need to be away it's just good to let people know why you're going and like you said try synchronise those breaks.
---
Yeah, a fury without crit and hit.
---
Why you shitposting mate?
---
Yeah, exactly lmfao idk why ppl tryna convert classic players into retail players. If you wanna play retail then go fuckin play retail and let us play classic lmao
---
Its possible to get past level 3 runecraft?
---
Skilled mage can poop on lock any day, lock is just easier and mage has higher skillcap
---
You'd leave General, TradeChat and LookingForGroup? So... You're playing a single player game now? Lol. That's not a solution my friend. 
---
OP, you should open a web ticket and report the guild.
---
Pm me the name of the guy if hes on ashbringer
---
56 Rogue, pushing 60. I'm finding it hard to prioritise my time. Either farm BRD for HoJ, or heavily quest to push for 60. 
---
Does anyone know what's better, Rune of the Guard Captain or Mark of the Chosen? Thinking about which to use with Blackhand's Breadth until I get lucky with HoJ.

---
It absolutely CAN be "Classic" AND something else at the same time; When the new content/expansion comes give an option to copy-paste (not transfer) character from classic to the new stuff. That way the very few people who want to continue being on unaltered classic can do so.
---
Oh Robert Redford was JJ. My dad would be disappointed I got that wrong lol (one of his favorite shows from back in the day).
---
pReTtY bAd aSs
---
To be honest I have no Fucking clue. The funny thing is shitty people can ruin your experience and neither myself nor the developer knows exactly how to curb this except to add more satisfaction to the solo experience. It’s an “interesting” solution to a problem that has too many variables. Odd that so many people are opting for a solo gameplay mode in an MMORPG.  But then again I don’t have a better idea.
---
You wanted classic you got classic how stupid is it to ask for TBC and WotlK in the future? People only long for the classic vanilla WoW experience stop chasing the dragon.
---
Total garbo, but i feel bad for you being so unlucky i'll take it off your hands for 500g
---
I think 40% in combat, 60/100% out of combat makes more sense to me. :D
---
THAT would be fair to other classes or not? I would love this as I just love druid and his forms and would easily get rid of that mount bc why tho if i could be a cheetah
---
SrGafo?
---
As a warlock this is the best thing ever. My irl friend runs feral tank so playing with him let's me find groups easier and let's me go nuts with my mana.
---
As before mentioned it greatly lowers chance encounters,  and allows you to negate/skip or not contend with anything between point A,B.  That’s avoidance in my book.
---
Pretty good, I've won rolls on two BoE epics being Gloves of Holy Might and Stonerender Gauntlets. Neither of them are that good but i certainly was lucky to win the rolls on 100% of BoE epics I've seen so far
---
helk pls
---
Is he in their guild? Doesn’t sound like it. And he can always rejoin those channels when he needs something.
---
It's just an option in the default blizzard keybinding menu.
---
If no one can be bothered to do a couple of dungeons for a player in the guild then that's a community problem. Other than that we could find a way to add incentives for people to run old content they don't like anymore.
---
I'm no Hitler. But gnomes need to be cleansed.
---
The issue with that is, if you don’t split the xpacs into separate products, just as many people will leave because they only wanted classic.
---
I don't think a vote is necessary, Blizzard only would need to commit to rollback a patch/features if they generate backlash. Sometimes it's hard for player to judge something if they haven't seen and felt it.
---
I'd say look up guides like in wowhead for example. They'll go more in depth than any of us would here
---
Classic+ works best. Sideways content would be a fantastic addition. 
---
I would also be very happy with TBC talent trees with a hard cap at lvl 60. TBC talent trees seem to be a more rounded experience for most classes vs classic.
---
It matters when you get chased down by someone on a mount. (On a pvp server anyways.)
---
even the alliance guide?
---
all i know is that if Classic actually deletes my character to restart the game, i’m done lol. 
---
but for real. classic as classic just feels good to me:
---
-  for RP folks, Horde vs. Alliance is a narrative that you can consistently get behind.
---
- for PvP, look at RP. plus ranks are dope and a challenge to gain. 
---
- for PvE, end game is very challenging for most folks. and leveling is a great solo activity.
---
retail is usually only good for one of those things. 
---
the whole package for a game is here. let’s not muddy it again (unless subs REALLY start dropping)
---
As Elem you will kill mobs way quicker but you'll have more down times. In the end it's almost the same so keep what you like
---
Is he in their guild? Doesn’t sound like it. He can always rejoin when he needs something.
---
Some of my friends couldn't do Karazhan in TBC because you needed a minimum spell effects setting for that bone dragon dude (to see his AoE).
---
That sounds reaally dumb lol
---
Ingenious, I like the cut of your jib sir!
---
If the do a #nochanges tbc, classic would already be dead imo. 
---
Also imbalance is not poor design. The current hyper balanced streamlined classes is poor design if you ask me. There are 0 RPG elements left in modern. Classic if nothing else, is a very well designed RPG.
---
No idea why people WOULDN'T want to group. Makes things so much easier for everybody. You don't have to fight over tags. You kill things quicker so they respawn quicker. If you're on a PvP server there's strength in numbers. If you're doing a kill quest less mobs need to be killed overall and you're out SUPER quick. 
---
This guy was retarded
---
I'll snap at people who are retards. But that sounds excessive. I dont even understand the problem, and honestly it sounds like he was just in the wrong.
---
What a retard
---
You mean retail
---
and this is how life long feuds are started :P
---
What addon Did you use for this?
---
&gt; When I played WoW hardcore years ago, there was always an unspoken (sometimes mentioned) courtesy in dungeon drops if you win a few greed rolls and need 1 or 2 things you start passing on the rest.
---
I played back in vanilla, and I don't remember this ever being a thing.
---
I wouldn't mind getting LFG. Unironically. I'm not asking for it, because I don't care enough, but I'm not one of those people that consider it a bad thing.
---
Arena was great, balancing around Arena and having seasonal rewards rather than just progressive rewards like the rest of WoW was a mistake.
---
Thanks mate.
---
Not an exact answer to your question, but I play on an East Coast PvP realm from Europe. Absolutely no problems on my end with MS.
---
Honestly, Im past getting mad at shit like this. Maybe it's one of the few advantages of getting a bit older, but I just don't care anymore. If they die, they die. Fuck em.
---
No "we" are not.
---
We're not armies, we're not soldiers in armies. And there are lot of &lt;pick any faction race&gt; in "enemy" territory that are friendly there. There is no battle field. There is no front line. Nowhere. There is especially no conquest that may move a front line.
---
All you do is chose to be an RP'er. But probably very very selective in just pretending there is war and you need to do &lt;things&gt; and ignoring all other RP or even downright looking down at real RP players on RP realms.
---
In reality, it's a choice a player makes when creating his or her character and is probably mostly depending on where one's friends play or what races appeal the most. Red players are players like everyone else. Some are nice, some are not.
---
By the way this war of yours is unwinnable. There is no way a gaming company will allow the utter defeat of \~50% of their player base, even if the consequences would be only short lived. Which when you think about it, makes the whole BFA retail story and setting more retarded than it already is.
---
&gt;The guy doesn't even know what year it is. 
---
Id say thats just next level trolling.
---
Yep, questing is your best bet.
---
“You value your time but not mine”
---
He literally gave off no vibe whatsoever of not valuing your time

Classic pvp is less "perfect balance between every class" and more "complicated game of rock paper scissors". Every class is better at some things but worse at others and there is a valid argument for why that's better. Classes actually have playstyles instead of just having a skill/talent for any scenario. "Perfect" balance is flat and boring because everything has to be so homogenized to make that happen. Classic pvp is chaotic and team-based, where a lot is going on and the goal is to cover your side's weaknesses better than the other team.
---
Unless you have a spellcaster in your group there is no need to kill him, so most groups I've joined just skip him entirely.
---
I play since day one of the release of classic and i’m still level 18. I’m just enjoying the environment , the quests, the long talk with people and the help between the community players.
---
Let classic be classic. I absolutely agree with this post.
---
Classic expansions for sure, I just want to play TBC again, for me it's the best expansion.
---
&gt; set a new record for longest wanking session is nobody's business.
---
I've managed to reach 5mins.
---
Are you using a pre-set profile ? I love how clean your elvui looks like
---
Classic+ for me. If the game got new content I'd be very interested in it. Old content, no matter what expansion it is from, doesn't cut it for me. The other thing is that if they'd take the expansion route, they'd be forced to make the same mistakes they once did again, and especially in the context of WotLK this is going to erase some fond memories...
---
Humm, looks like it won't work.
---
Need to check the "new" macro limitations
---
Without a pocket healer you mean?
---
Don’t need any more support than a healer then you’re an absolute wrecking ball.
---
I use auctioneer and auctionfaster and honestly I don't think they are great. Ideally I would use tradeskillmaster I think, but it has some things that I don't like that I will need to learn how to turn off, and I haven't looked too into it yet.
---
wow devs did confirm that the item has always been in the game from launch. but that it just never dropped since its a low drop chance.
---
Thank you very much, that helps a lot!
---
I'm fine with playing any content in the spirit of those 3 expansions to be honest. 
---
I'll play anything that comes my way as long as the journey there is harsh, long, epic, humbling, and worth my peon adventurer time. 
---
As someone who really started playing around TLK I'm intimately more concerned with the class balance that's in place in Vanilla right now.
---
Everything feels extremely restricted not only in playstyles but overall class choices.. 
---
It might have been ok in the beginning to only have 4 DPS classes that could actually do shit (and you'd see 95% of the DPS roster composed of them). 
---
But on the long run not being able to play the class you love the esthetics, story, lore, and feel outside of its designated "role" sucks.
---
The F you mean I can't bring my elemental shaman to raid???
---
or since the distance is arbitrary to start with, it's actually the same distance and they just used different words
---
No we don’t. No one has said that.
---
My biggest problem is that my friend is so slow. We rolled Warrior and Priest, and I dont play that much (More than him) but I am at least 2x as effective.
---
I am at lvl 35 while he is at 30, and since I dont want to outlevel him too bad, I've started making alts, and getting them to around 20. 
---
I really want to hit max lvl (I never did that in 06) but I dont want to abandon my slow leveling friend.
---
What a dilemma.
---
WotLK was already ruined. It was when dungeon finder was added, when gear became accessible and don't forget the first raid content of the expansion being cleared faster than 2019 classic MC. BC would be good, WotLK would remove a lot of rose tinted glasses.
---
Thankss Im new and Im always asking in general chat, this will be very useful!!
---
Me too and I still don’t have 20 fucking hides
---
Soooo its ok to tell ppl ur a rank 1 veteran with no proof? Cuz i will do that if it gets me upvotes

how is the hunter boost shit? it's 10% less than druid/shaman but you're not hindered in anyway, you can use it to kite in pvp vs melee matchups and dwarf hunters look great speeding along on their stumps.
---

Neat.

Been playing on Wotlk private servers and my favourite villian of all time is the Lich King. Really would be a dream come true if i could down LK on blizz servers.

I don't have issues getting a group as a Warlock... I usually end up getting whispers asking me to go.

Someone please donate me few hundred € for gaming pc, so i could experience Kenshi with more than 15fps.

ZOMG GUIS I JUST REALISED SOMETHING? Maybe, it happens both sides, because the difference isn't ideological just preference for what race they picked? Think I'm on to something.
---
Also, I kill ally because the first ally I seen in game I waved at the lvl 22 pally and I was 25, then a party of 5 lvl 20_22 ally camped my corpse. I will be ending every ally I see due to that 5 hahaha
---
I just got one to drop after killing 3 whelps :/
---
Grind SM 32-41
---
i am all for the expansions but also adding classic exclusive content where it makes the expansions not change how the game plays from classic and more just make it unique versions of the expansions
---
Best I can do atm its with a mod.

/cast [mod:shift] !Bear form

Haha, I actually rolled Human in the end cos my guild decided to play on a PVE server which I wasn't too happy about.
---
I have everything else gnome though, warlock, mage and rogue. 
---
I was gnome warrior from retail vanilla and still have him in BFA.
---
But that's one of the good changes from retail. We want \#NoChanges reeeeee
---

For a fact I will not play retail, I have no interet in playing anything retail like.
---
I want to keep this OLD mmo experience. This is how MMOs were meant to be played.
---
no, can confirm once its colorful it stays (unless you use another consolecommand)
---
&gt; If no one can be bothered to do a couple of dungeons for a player in the guild then that's a community problem. 
---
This is not about "not beeing bothered". Of course people were willing to do so, but that doesn't mean it wasn't annoying.
---
No one cares what risks you are willing to take, they care about wow classic. This ain't about you, look at the history of wow.
---
You can make anything work. I’m a level 42 hunter and haven’t used a potion yet other than drops from mobs but I’m sure it could add some new mechanics. 
---
I went engineering/mining and making my own bullets/guns has been fun. 
---
Sorry for not really answering the question just showing that regardless of what you pick you can make it work.
---
I think they care about the player base insofar as "who's paying", and not so much about where we play once we've paid.  And if Old Azeroth is a separate game, requiring a separate subscription...  well, from Blizzard's point of view, "people will play both!!!" 
---
But anyway, we're speculating.  You may be right; not really expecting anything.
---
KILL ALL GNOMES. THEY MUST BE CLEANSED.
---
You know this because you are psychic.
---
*whoosh*
---
I think it’s useful for all classes. You can make your own potions and flasks which are always needed.
---
Finding the correct pace is very tricky.
---
There are enough people to have multiple full servers for both.
---
Not at all. Every class had a viable arena spec and composition which creating a compelling metagame. The alternative is the Legion system where they try to shoehorn a pvp build into every single spec on the off chance people want to play arena as demonology.
---
I never got to experience BC it WotlK, so experiencing these would be great. However, there are some changes in these expansions that might  take awat from the classic experience for me, i.e. flying mounts, so maybe Classic+ versions of this expansions would be better. Also, I'm not a fan of old content becoming increasingly redundant with increased level caps.
---
Either way, I would like to see balance changes whatever happens (NOT homogenisation), as I've heard good things about BC and wrath for class balance, especially for some of the hybrid specs that I want to play *cough* Boomkin *Cough*.
---
AFAIK there are none that chances the model that will work, since shapreshifting dispell them all.
---
Thanks! The other ones worked but this would be one button with shift I’ll try it too
---
Threat per rage would be an awesome information then
---
what do you guys think wows past should look like?
---
I wouldn't feel that bad, it's a Twink item for battle grounds, because they bracket players by levels, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39 etc., and it's a level 19 item, but battle grounds don't come out until phase 3, which could be a year or more away. So you would have been sitting on that thing for a hella long time before it truly became worth 200-300 gold. By then, if you're still playing, you'd have had time to farm more gold than that.
---
I'd be fucking ecstatic with 67 gold in my 20s.
---
Replace cat with whatever you want, but if you click it again itll just powershift that form you can also try this 
---
#showtooltip Cat Form
---
/cancelaura [stance:1] Bear Form; [stance:2] Aquatic Form; [stance:4] Travel Form; [stance:5] Moonkin Form
---
/cancelaura [mounted] nameofmount
---
^^ that will out you into cat form from any other form and cause you to shift out of cat form if youre in it already. You can change it to bear form by changing the /showtooltip and changing the [stance:1] Bear Form to [stance:3] Cat Form then replacing the /cast with Bear Form 
---
(You can do it for any of your stances by replacing the things like that assuming you got your forms in order bear/aquatic/cat/travel/moonkin then the stance numbers are correct in the post.
---
I had basically no idea how to write this stuff yesterday. I looked up a bunch of macros and asked someone on a nother post. I seem to be okay now.
---
Really easy bonus macro
---
#showtooltip Rebirth
---
/cast Rebirth
---
^^ jump out of form and battle res (itll use the highest rank BR you have unless you specify a rank for it to cast) 
---
I also have one just like that but for rejuv.
---
Awesome art! Enjoyed everyone so far!
---
I’d love to see one from the Test of Fate quest in thousand needles ❤️
---
Yeah I think a better argument would be that they’re not really optimally specced for pvp. Might have less crit damage and frequency.
---
So with this stance if just before we started dungeon 1 you went for a piss and then at the end of dungeon 1 i went for a piss you would be annoyed ?
---
Me too. I buff them as I pass
---
As an UD rogue, we live on your hatred. Seeing posts like that make me kill more of you while u are wasting your precious time, I laugh so hard.
---
No reset. Don't care about stagnation, don't touch my shit.
---
Maybe you're too dumb to get people's unfunny sarcasm? 
---
I mean you did say that you have to have "planet sized ball" to risk losing imaginary opinion points on reddit.
---
I don't have the specific answer to you question but have you tried checking the priest masters in the other capitals ?
---
Retail no longer has PvP/PvE servers, anyone can opt into or out of world PvP.
---
The result has been Alliance overwhelmingly opting out.
---
That's a great answer, thanks! Picking up those 60 resists for 75 TP seems very valuable no matter what I do actually.
---
Classic+ has extreme potential... Just make sure the people making it are old school minded to keep it in the same spirit as vanilla
---
Who would make better healer druid or shaman?
---
I think flying mounts as a concept are nice but they way they were implemented caused a problem.
---
Imagine flying mounts but with:
---
* Semi-long-ish cast time to mount/dismount (perhaps with the mount spawning above you and diving down to land)
---
* Flying ceiling that limits access to some high-altitude areas
---
Flying mounts would still be useful as an alternative to going to a flight master but with less of a insta-cast feel to them you couldn't just pop on and off your mount at will.
---
Yes, that is what I am always saying. But people automatically go super defensive every time because they thing "lfg tool" means automatic matchmaking. -_-
---
Unless they would only change the skeleton and skin and have all undead get the same racials.
---
There is a fucking forsaken gnome in undercity that I found last week. I was amazed Id never heard of him before.
---
The fact that you deleted your hole script there, plus your repply makes my conclusion a 100% fact.
---
If you cant reach, dont jump.
---
It make you look like a fool
---
Yeah I agree with this. But it mostly comes down to your preference. Not even wowhead can give you that. Maybe you just need to switch it up?
---
i posted this a week and a half ago: 
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /castsequence Find Herbs, Find Minerals
---
i put it on the tilde key so i can spam it with tab for targeting.
---
Only issue with this is youll powershift bearform if you click it again.
---
&gt; No "we" are not.
---
Yes we are.
---
Yup you are right and i get your point, cant fight the reddit hivemind though. I often sort comments by controversial on these threads to see if anyone is outside the massive circlejerk of this subreddit. Classic is great, its not the most popular game right now by far
---
Try the add on spy
---
Are you seriously saying that wintergrasp was better than tol barad?
---
Also wrath already ruined 2vs2 and 5vs5.
---
I'm glad you said something about mages. Because I'm not wasting my money simply because you want to go fast.
---
You can get to 20 easily as Alliance with only quests from Loch Modan, Westfall and a couple of quests in Redridge, without any grinding and no Dungeons. No need to go to Darkshore.
---
Yea stop discussing the future of a game on a forum dedicated to discussing a game
---
Yeah unless you are below the 20s
---
Last night, we just finish running ST. It's 3 AM (for me). Someone in party: guys you wanna run BRD?
---
Yeah, about that.
---
Definitely Burning Crusade and then stop. Best expansion ever for any game in history, by far.
---
Fact!
---
Because it takes 14 seconds I believe for a mount to overtake a shaman in speed because of cast time.
---
Yup, eagle eye.
---
Now that’s dedication.
---
Unfinished? Sounds like Druid to me!
---
I felt like belfs and draenai were fine, as with goblins and worgen. What really irked me was they went for a neutral race after that rather than something like Ogres that have been sitting there available for ages. Im sure they couldve found some faction to join alliance like a sect of naga or something
---
Dueling another warrior is basically who can get lucky first, you can counter basically all of eachothers spells except hamstring, so you're both wandering back and forth at a snails pace autoing/msing until they dodge or you get a huge crit then it's basically gg.
---
My favorite duel was against a paladin slightly after WotLK launched, we were both mid 70s and everytime he'd try to heal, I'd back off and charge to intterupt(he'd shield to prevent my pummel). If charge was on cooldown, I'd back off and drop combat and try to eat. If I didn't have that much time I'd bandage. 
---
TL;DR; the duel last like nearly 15 minutes and the paladin almost died, he ended up logging on his horde toon and whispering me it was one of the best duels he's ever had.
---
I'm bummed that all of them works in retail, but not in classic. I can see it gives a slight advantage in pvp, but I'm really longing for some fun effects.
---
Didn't this game just come out? It was years between the original release and the first expansion. I get some people are powering through the content but how's about we lay off the DEVs for like 5 minutes and appreciate what we've only just been given.
---
To early.. it's for raiding to make potions... no one is raiding yet at least not lost people.. ur just to early
---
tip 1: don't watch asmongold
---
If you're not posting low effort circlejerk, you are a troll.
---
&gt; They usually will wait until I'm low on health/Mana before jumping on me because that's how alliance roll.
---
what if I told you that horde does the same? it's almost as if it's about the human behind the character and not the faction :O
---
I would love TBC but patch by patch.
---
This guy Classics.
---
Eh, if my horde friend started it, and he is getting his ass kicked, I sure as hell aint helping. His decision, he gets to take the consequences. 
---
It gets a bit annoying when you get ganked by a warrior, when you are fighting a mob, you start taking over the fight, and he runs a bit back to have his mage friend finishing you off. That is just pathetic.
---
I dont want to be that player, so I'll let you guys brawl it out in peace.
---
In Badlands, close to Kargath and a vendor, you can farm Earth elementals and sell their grey rocks and stones for almost 10s per piece.
---
I think you also have the same situation in Tanaris. 
---
Turtles that drop alot of grey and their possible to skin, and there is a vendor RIGHT THERE on the spot which make inventory issues close to zero.
---
(if you have fishing this spot is for you)
---
Otherwise I suggest flipping BoE's on AH, several rare world drop items can be found on AH for 3-6g and sold for 10X in a few weeks/months when people start creating alts, either to speed the process up, look nice or twink and wreck ppl in BG's. (Prices are rising everyday now)
---
Many players find rare BoE and sell for nothing, like Cassandra's grace. BiS healing ring at 60 phase 1, found it on AH for 7g, sold it for 45g within the next day. Probably could have gotten more for it also hehe, but I'm 37 and have mount rdy and several rare BoE's I bought for cheap.
---
I really recommend having a BANK ALT stationed in IF or SW, most importantly to post your auctions but also to look for good deals and rare items posted by players with less knowledge of the market.
---
Send this bank alt items, mats and gold.
---
Use it and manage your "WoW wallet", download addon like BetterVendorPrice and AHdatabase to let you have complete information about prices etc, to make it easier to know if this should go on AH or just vendor.
---
Hope this helps on the way to your mount!
---
Posted this is another thread, but does anyone know what's better, Rune of the Guard Captain or Mark of the Chosen as a Rogue? Thinking about which to use with Blackhand's Breadth until I get lucky with Hand of Justice.
---
The most unrealistic part of the game
---
What ? I didnt delete anything ?
---
&gt; The gear was horrible, the RP was obnoxious, no trash was annoying, the whole raid being in one room was awful, the 10 man version was waayy too easy, and the dailies were hot garbage.
---
&gt; The bosses were almost all really well done though. Unique mechanics, interesting strategies, making PvE carebears learn how to push their PvP buttons. And hard mode Anub was an awesome fight.
---
Also yes.
---
Me as a 56 priest: YOU GET A BUFF, AND YOU GET A BUFF, aaaand I've got to drink for 40 seconds
---
Posting this in a classic wow subreddit, daring are we?
---
Well it was more of a hybrid homeless shelter/sewers/catacombs/prison. Also you're right, I meant to say the capital. I fixed it!
---
Skeram.
---
In my opinion, when it comes to 5 man dungeons 
---
Paladin tank &gt; warrior tank
---
He described an expansion. Nothing about his comment is unique to TBC
---
I saw that, edited my comment right after posting it.
---
Were you partied up?
---
Alliance dont surf
---
I tried, never finished unfortunately
---
As mage i always give that sweet int. buff. I know you need it hurdur
---
That's different because it is an endgame item.
---
No you didn't, I was tanking Mu'ru with less than that.
---
I really want to see wotlk again.
---
Hellfire Citadel
---
he asked nicely. you couldnt spare a little bit of your regenerative resource?
---
Only because of the success from classic and BC
---
Reading comments in here Im so glad that none of you are the devs or have any influence to sway design.
---
This map is very misleading. Redridge is definitely needed to level mid Westfall, then you return to RR mid Duskwood.
---
Bloodsail is a "normal" RP server, not RP-PVP.  And while I can't speak for Bloodsail most of us on RP-PVP servers play there partly because we want to avoid being around people who play that way.
---
Incredibly naive outlook my man.
---
I am in agreement with OP here. This is a chance for me to do the things I wanted to but didn't have time or couldn't do before, when TBC Came out. I want to play alliance &amp; horde to 60, have multiple chars geared in classic. Each class is a new chance at the game and the content simply does not play exactly the same with each class.  I hope in 10 years time I can still login to the classic world, preserved properly. Otherwise if the server is reset or expansion released...where will I go? Private?
---
im focused on leveling and dont feel like wasting my time with running back to my corpse and I also dont want others to have to do the same. I also enjoy waving while running straight into a player from the opposite side - to see how they will react.   
---
dunno, I will fight them when I am 60 and in battlegrounds - now I just want to level.
---
Just to add to u/xmortus’ answer, windfury totem is essentially directly buffing player’s weapons, but since you already have your own windfury buff on your weapon nothing happens. If you go into character screen and look at your weapon you’ll see the green text with the name of the buff on it.
---
There were addons for cast bars dummy.
---
They're not burning out because it's not built on nostalgia. It's just a really damn good game.
---
Classic + . It should develop in a way that does not make older content irrelevant.
---
Relative to a new game, classic cost almost nothing. It also doesn’t have a growth business model and it’s launch brought in a fraction of what any of their other content drops would.
---
Meanwhile I can't put together a group to make it all the way through BFD. The number of people who don't know how threat and aggro work for tanks is way too high.
---
As a healer I would rather a mob pound on me until the tank gets it that have you take it from me. I have self heals, bubble and ways of dropping threat. It's not as dangerous as you think. Additionally, if you take it now there are three targets that need to be healed, not just two.
---
Corpsemaker on my first RFK run would be the luckiest ive gotten
---
Yeah I think have too much expextions for vanilla Raiding :p I've enjoyed healing in dungeons though so very tempting to reroll to disc or holy
---
STV, Arathi, 1k needles, badlands, desolace, alterac ..... quite a lot of good 30-40 zones for horde :P
---
As a level 30 alliance you can make great use of the shadow realm and corpse walking. Because I'm waiting in the highlands for you. (Stealth noise)
---
Naxx is a joke compared to current WoW. People will pug it first week.
---
Love me some "Elwinn" forest 🙃
---
Dire Maul is phase 2, as well.
---
30 was a real sticking point for me. You’ll get destroyed in STV. I bumbled around doing a few quests in South Shore, then Desolace is decent for a couple of levels. STV sucks less once you get to 33-34 and fuck those Kurzen Medicine Men
---
Dude, I love having Warlocks in my group, unless they're bad and Hellfire 1 sec into a pull and kill themselves.
---
But do you have 10 serpentbloom is the real question.
---
No. That's why you sell it after you get it again.
---
I'm 6'4" IRL and I enjoy the perspective change. 
---
Plus no one enjoys getting killed my a Gnome in PVP.
---
No, I didn't quit retail because it isn't classic WoW. They are two different games.
---
I quit retail because Azerite power and Zerite gear is dumb, warforging and titan forging is dumb, weekly/daily lootboxes are dumb, not having PvP vendos is dumb, and being able to do all content BUT mythic raiding cross realm from the get-go is dumb. 
---
WoW retail will never be the MMO WoW classic is and they shouldn't try to be, they should try to fix all the shit changes they made with BfA.
---
I knew you would say that!
---
I feel this.  I go to bed by 9 so if I don’t start a run by 7pm, I am not going to get enough sleep.
---
Classic+ definitely. Maybe tbc and then the + part
---
If they bothered to read their quest text they would know about it :)
---
Business in the front, party in the back
---
You think you want it, but you dont.
---
You said it. It'd be fine with a server reset maybe once every 2 years or something
---
No problem, just honestly glad that someone will debate a bit in this, I see so much “BC WAs THe wOrsT REEEEE”
---
In BC they didn’t do a lot on integrating flying into the world, but they took a huge step forward with WOTLK where 2 new zones were added whose design relied on flying and only enhanced the experience of leveling there. Not to mention everyone wasn’t getting their flying mount right at 70 (at the offset) and for a huge number of people flying puts them out of the capital, even in the air. FPs as a replacement have gotten better over the years with autopathing and routes, which has made not having flying for the majority of new expansions better.
---
I think the primary reason content is time gated is obvious and it sucks. Blizzard knows people would binge it and finish it. They wouldn’t see the forest for the trees instead choosing to race through it for the best rewards. Secondly, they can’t keep up with the content production when binging the content becomes the norm. 
---
The arena vs r14 thing is a great example. For rank 14 you had to binge PVP for a short duration. Then, once you 14 you had your rewards and we’re set. Arena though, was a lower intensity grind to reach gladiator in a season, but you had to invest longer. This allowed blizzard to set the floor with engagement which helped them pace development which was massively important to subscribers.
---
And the arena content doesn’t reset every season either. It’s not like you’re unable to wear your title/ mount the next season. But you’re competing for a whole new set of rewards, so it should be a complete reset. 
---
SFK doesn’t open up at all. There is a single split that converges on the same point with one route having a boss, another have a chance at a rare. BRD is a great example and I totally agree that more large, sprawling outside, multi routes dungeons would be great. I think the new Kara was a great start to that.
---
Gears is tough. First, most people in BC weren’t farming mindless dungeons for badges. They were doing the dungeons that dropped what they needed and used badges to fill in specific slots otherwise.
---
I don’t think hit needed to be found in every piece of gear. I also don’t think hit should be so rare that it exists on so little gear, that it takes up permanent gear slots. A happy medium exists. This is a verticals progression game, even in vanilla. If you release a new raid whose rewards are worse then the old ones, less people will do it.
---
Anyone telling you to quest is crazy. You can do SM GY at 30 if groups will take you. If they won’t, get 32 and then do it. Then do SM to ~43 and ZF to the 50s.
---
Not at all. A current full server holds well over 10k people, vastly more than the fullest of full vanilla servers (~3.5k) used to have. And there are many of these.
---
That what I assumed. I’d bet you still have 3-4 months+ before BGs are even released and probably even longer before golds at a level to justify that level of spends. I’d just focus on leveling and getting to a higher level. Other dungeons at your level can drop great boes too.
---
A slight tilt sure, but not like that nelf. You lack an anchor point doing it this way
---
You on noggerfogger server by any chance. My name is darkspawn on that server :D.
---
Depending on how the art team goes about designing, one way is to use a stylus pen. I’m sure taking 3 seconds to write “help” isn’t something that would make or break a deadline.
---
ez SM to 42 then maybe a few quest in tanaris to 44 and ZF to 50 :)
---
Classic + would be awesome!!!
---
and  you've proven you never did it. Thanks lol.
---
What the what
---
Expacs up to WoTLK then switch to unique content before cataclysm.
---
Oh yay another one of these "I'm having more fun than you because I'm leveling at a snails pace" posts.  Cool.
---
2-3 times? Thats 20-30 seconds of 2h tanking... hm
---
some things AH for significantly more than they vendor for, you're honestly missing out on a ton of money.
---
You.. never raided in TBC. Like at all.
---
Cheeto
---
Is it an RP guild ? On what realm are you playing ?
---
It buffs up your shocks for sure
---
Yeah people tend to not think about letting the tank gain aggro first and just try to yolo it like retail.
---
You can, I prefer the macro's to swap from cat/bear/travel automatically and then I have /cancelform on all of my heals/instants, as well as a macro that just cancels any form i'm in. 
---
I also have one like you requested but its a little weirder to set up because you have to put stance modifiers in. It basically ends up looking like an if/then macro. I can grab it when I get home.
---
I personally use Z as /cancelform /cast bear form X as /cancelform /cast cat form and ctrl-C as just /cancelform for picking up quests and items. Then I made macros for rejuv/decurse/remove poison/mark of the wild/thorns that all have /cancelform in front of them.
---
Classic expansions!!! I WANT TO PLAY WOTLK!!!
---
It’s more annoying to get hit by all those arrows.
---
That guy was an idiot. 
---
For those who don't know the story, guy would go hang out around grizzly bears and film himself getting real close to them. Park rangers and others continuously told him to stop because he was going to get hurt. 
---
He didn't listen, brought his girlfriend there with him, and consequently got mauled, of course, because,  as it turns out, bears don't like it when you prance around their feeding areas making noise. 
---
There is audio of this mauling on live leak. don't listen to it.
---
Took me a while to work out why your guild chat is nothing but LFG spam.
---
Just fish. Get to 175. Get some lures. Go up and down Tanaris starting at level 20. Get all dem eels and runecloth from chest and boom mount in 1 day.
---
Definitely.
---
Just reading through this thread, it looks like everyone has their own modified version of Classic+ they would like.
---
Classic+ sounds like a pipe dream to be honest. It might be great but is it realistically going to happen?
---
I mean insulting a game for being shit is one thing, but trashing on people for enjoying something you don't is another level of being garbage.
---
I'm in the early 50s and boy did i just hit a wall of no quests and slow leveling.
---
What if both have moved up the ladder considerably and are now near the top?
---
To counter this argument have you looked at osrs and what they did?
---
Well yeah definitely agree with you if you're doing it hardcore like that its fair enough you know what's up. That appeala to a different group of people probably the ones who are maybe a bit older don't live with parents who might get them to do something quickly etc. Just think if you're doing a more casual run its annoying for people to get pissed at people for going away for a minute when they need a bathroom break or something.
---
The game always felt like a trilogy to me, they blew it up after Cata. I would be happy to see BC and WOTLK release as they did.
---
Shh pleb
---
Yes which is why everyone fondly remembers wintergrasp and shits on tol barad, told barad was just dreadful
---
Yeah, I get it. Different strokes and all. Just trying to give a potential explanation (other than racials and stuff) as to why humans are a popular pick :P
---
This weirdly works sometimes but other times when I’ve gone bear form and try go cat form it gives the usual prompt that the switch isn’t possible... when I re drag the macro and press it again it works but then I try it again from NE same issue =[
---
I feel you. Just know that there's enough charts out there proving that the servers are still mostly filled with people in our level range. Being 60, or close to it, is still something only a couple of people have done compared to the masses. Azeroth is big enough for all of us, so just do it at your own pace.
---
It wasn't always new guys, tho. If often was people who simply took a break and then couldn't raid with us due to attunements till we had the time to carry that player through.
---
Tho, I remember that you even had to do raids to access the following ones (I think you had to do the one with Vashj before you could get into the next one?).
---
Frost spec is the best pvp spec so....
---
Option 2.
---
Option 3.
---
Option 1.
---
&gt; it encourages me to enjoy the game instead of trying to keep up with the top
---
Why would you ever play in a way that you didn't enjoy?
---
Paladin tanks are amazing for 5-10 mans but they literally cannot raid tank due to lack of taunt, most fights are impossible for them to tank simply because they lack a taunt
---
If you don't plan on raiding, prot paladin is amazing for AOE gold farming and dungeon spam.
---
Herod went from 5 hour queues at 3pm when I get home from work to no queue until around 5pm. Maybe the transfers to the new server helps, but I personally know 3 people who already quit classic.  
---
I know that it’s anecdotal, but I know I’m not the only person who’s had friends quit already.
---
It is not the range that is larger... Everything is 9.36% larger in Germany... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
We've all got a couple years before content releases but its better to discuss the direction of the game now then be panicing and clueless 6 months from the end of planned content.
---
If they do it with classic expansions ill sign back up for B.C and Wrath
---
exactly this.   
---
tanks and healers already have (mental or actual) lists of peeps never ever getting an inv.
---
I should know, i'm a healer...
---
&gt; The 15% agi in survival is actually the best spec if you reach the breakpoint.
---
I wish people would stop saying this.  For the lightning reflexes build to pull ahead you need every buff imaginable and full naxx bis gear.  In addition, you're entirely world buff dependant (God forbid you die or time-out) and you also lose trueshot aura.  All that for *slightly* higher single target.
---
The only reason to rock LR is if you don't want to respec between raid and pvp.
---
Honor system
---
Didnt know that, thanks
---
Would prefer to see classic+ rather than any server resets. I would like to see an attempt at making all specs/classes viable and new zones/dungeons for classic.
---
I picture you rubbing your nipples worrying about karma.
---
Was that on a private server? Lol.
---
I am telling you as someone who has played in many high end retail guilds that you don’t transfer with an intact raid roster. From the sounds of your story not everyone transferred. 
---
And no. The reward is not that I get to play normally. The reward is that I get to play a product that I pay for. And lol I am telling you that the longer blizzard forces quenes people aren’t going to transfer. People will just quit.
---
Also many people have fear of servers becoming ghost towns. I plan to play for a long time. Why the fuck would I transfer now when I am on one of the most populated servers with a guarantee that it will remain populated? Nope.
---
BS generates aggro??
---
What you want is retails find a group tool.
---
Yulp twitch app or google one of the add ins and you can download directly. But the twitch addon will auto update. Just download it and drop it in your Arron’s folder. That is found by finding your wow folder inside the interface folder. Drop it there then log in. You will be happy.
---
There was a post here about this exact thing earlier this week. On a priest also.
---
Uhm sure i did... not like i would forget something like that
---
This is gold !

For anyone wandering about the music : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agL9ftHYrRQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agL9ftHYrRQ)
---
Me on the bottom-right two weeks ago
---
Now I'm in Stranglethorn and my buddy's next piece of advice was: "Go talk to that quest-giver, those horde won't attack trust me."
---
&gt;!They attacked!&lt; &gt;!And they camped my body!&lt;
---
Yes...and it would still take hours to respawn if he let the guy tame it. What's your point?
---
Well you can always use other modifier to cat
---
Change it to
---
/cast [mod:ctrl,nostance] !Cat form
---
 Or mod:alt if you prefer alt
---
You really don't know what you're talking  about.
---
Haha yeah, that's one way to summarise it!
---
I find it only happens if you aggro them.  This can be done in close proximity or dropping AoEs that hit them.  As long as you arent sitting up against the walls you'll be fine.
---
Full on progression. (so Classic Expansions in the options you provide)
---
There's many QoL improvements that should be in the base game though. Like the BfA models not being in the current client, even though it makes no difference other than making the game look better.
---
Someone completely uninvolved was effected due to both of the jerk actions.  So yes it does matter what the other guy did
---
Im 30 and still always using weakest ammo 
---
More than enough
---
Lol I’m in a low pop server normally there’s nobody there to steal mobs from
---
In my opinion this should help balance factions. If I'm on a server that is horde dominant as alliance I should get the benefit of faster queues. More people are likely to join my faction now because queues are faster as well.
---
wow, what you just said is extremely cringy...
---
It's hilarious and sad to me that people would rush through all the leveling content classic offers, ignoring most of it with dungeon spam, layer abuse and mage aoe farming, and then want blizzard to start adding more content just because they can't pace themselves.
---
Intellect all the way
---
Never seen them I guess you are horde then?
---
Whad'ya mean not yet? They got married last month.
---
Its funny cuz i remember back then when TBC came out i rushed to 70 to get my flying mount and as cool as it was then i didnt realize how much it changed the world from then on.
---
Tournament of Champions raid.  
---
That alone should be enough to make wotlk a worse expansion that TBC
---
"You prostituting yourself for cheeseburgers again?"
---
You can try sweet talking her into trying the game, maybe promising to do something in return, and seeing that way whether she'll like it or not. You can't really trick anyone into liking something.
---
iirc it has been like that in vanilla. So by Blizzard's definition of a true vanilla experience I wouldn't consider this to be a bug.
---
This looks amazing. You should make WoW classic comics! I'd love to read them &lt;3
---
From my dungeon grinding and auction house knowledge you could make a gold or 2 from farming stockades just from wool alone (1s per on my server). Farming higher level dungeons for silk and lvl 30 greens are way higher value though.
---
There would be one less hunter camping the tame.
---
Am I the only one concerned that this guy only has 4 soul stones in his bag?
---
As a warlock main I prefer to not have summon meeting stones. Makes the class unique and highly valuable to any group for their utility. The class is still good with them but not AS good.
---
But ... It says Level 60 below the spell rank on both.
---
Most of the people that play this game are adults with very little free time. If you join a dungeon then make sure you can fully commit or don't join. If there is any possibility you can't focus the entire time then don't join.
---
The only time I have seen this happen there are windows on the ship or house and I think that’s working as intended.
---
or just dps tank and cleave/whirlwind
---
" \*Flying Mounts "
---
Disagree on that.
---
Contrary to what some people might believe, the faster and more convenient flying mounts were SELDOM the reason why people tire of the game faster, or even less immersive.
---
In fact the opposite is more likely true, and the gating of flying (Pathfinder) only turned out to be annoying.
---
I find it far more likely that PvP griefers and gankers want flying out of the game to suit their purposes.
---
Then you’re only doing nice things for the recognition. So you’re “nice” things are just self serving ego trips. Classic trump move.
---
Me too
---
how do you translate distance?
---
You just summed up my own experience. Except the PvP part. I’m playing on pve: so just 3 days /played on my count but just in the 30s. Yesterday I spent a whole day with Crafting to fish and cook better buffood and traveling through the whole world to tame new pets to get the next skilllevels for my hunter pet... stuff like that is why I love the game. And that’s why I’m fine with phase 2 coming end of the year or way later. 
---
And wait... what about another character....
---
Because of the FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) situation mmo's tend to create. "Better get on the hype train now before everybody outgears you and you can't find groups to do content with anymore." Is the general thought imo. Screw that tho I'mma take it slow. Level 17 hunter and proud!
---
IMO it has a stronger questing progression for Alliance. I would still say 20 is a better level for the lower bound, but the northwestern corner definitely has some low level quests for alliance.
---
Just ask her if she would be interested in trying it out. Do without all the smoke and mirrors. Also, why specifically Hunter?
---
TBC and then TBC+
---
First off, there's going to be 6 phases that will last a couple years.  Nobody is asking for any changes right now.  Second, in a few years we're all going to grow bored of the current content.
---
Private servers always have lifespans and evolving playerbases.  Just because there have always been some with players doesn't mean most don't lose population and nearly die out after 6 months, leaving nothing but the hardcore nerds to farm Naxx forever.
---
It's perfectly valid to discuss what should be done post Naxx, a few years down the line.  And it's weird to even request people don't talk about something.  Like really?  And Blizzard has many talented and smart people working there, and they're finally listening to the community on this project.  I'm not going to act like a cynical douche out of the gate and presuppose any new content would have to be bad.
---
None of the above. Where’s the option for true classic without reset?
---
People were complaining their nameplates reverted back to the default 20ft.
---
22 Human warrior ran past me in The Barrens towards Ratchet and was not flagged for PvP. 
---
How the f?
---
Only for non human/orc
---
This is probably a stupid question but how did you get character levels on your unit frames in elvui. Its driving me nuts not seeing what level my target is unless I mouseover and look at the tooltip.
---
&gt;Gear score NEVER EVER EVER needs to be put into classic.
---
Too late. The addon already exists. You know gear score was an addon right? Blizzard's current iteration just going on ilvl actually works a LOT better with how items work now.. which is sad :(
---
IM NOT SURE. We were but i duuno if we were when I was trying
---
costs **$37**
---
Freedom fries are still French fries no matter how you slice them.
---
The only lines worth recognizing are white and powdery.
---
Right?
---
Thank you very much I’ll use your macro. Appreciate it
---
This!
---
They shouldn't have holy resist though, so why would level matter?
---
AOE grinding what’s the fun of it?
---
(But I agree, I hate multiboxers even more than aoe farmers)
---
True classic with servers restarting?? No. True classic is just what it is now. Forever.
---
Nameplates is indeed changed. Easy to see for yourself. Just login and try to switch the distance. This command worked previously:
---
/run SetCVar("nameplateMaxDistance","6e1")
---
Would have preferred it being in game. I use an addon to see debuffs on nameplates. Handy for being a warlock and see dots ticking. With only range 20 it's much less useful since you will be farther out when playing in a group. Solo it's not that big a deal since mobs ends up closer to you.
---
You’re the worst.
---
As a healer I just let dps die who intentionally disregard mechanics (that I explained before hand) or constantly pull for the tank or pull threat from the tank so their number on recount is bigger. Players that do this, more times than not, are also toxic and have a bad attitude and those are the people i let die. I’m not wasting half my mana bar spamming inefficient heals to keep a dps  alive that only cares about their number on recount and potentially causing a wipe if i cant heal the tank because im oom. Its the best way for them to learn.
---
Im rolling a mage because i liked the vanilla pvp mage can pull off.
---
I dont think somone would play a class they  didnt like.
---
The screenshot was taken on Wowhead
---
Link? I'm also guessing this would be on a low pop server
---
The original dungeon finder wasn't horrible to me.  You basically picked a dungeon it added you to a list.  People trying to do the dungeon could see your class and level and they'd have to message you to invite or ask specifics about role and stuff.  I feel like that and the meeting stone being able to summon wouldn't be terrible.  Beats combing through the LFG and trade chat channels.  Definitely not interested in cross realms or the dungeon finder system that auto-built a team based on a queue though.
---
Warriors and Hunter's pets always get my highest PW:F buff, slap a Renew so their at max health quick and cary on. 
---
Feels good man.
---
Why not go insulated stainless steel? Cold water is best imo
---
If you can handle it you should try pulling 2 packs at a time. So pull one pack, get aggro, 50% hp on mob then pull next pack. This strat seems to work with mana efficient healers.
---
There's more than one way. The translator tries to break everything into individual characters because that's easier to automate, I don't think it has the actual algorithm that the game uses to translate text.
---
In the AMA they suggested it as a possibility.
---
A lot of this issue is unseen by dps because the healer deals with it.  It's unfortunate because the group would be so much faster if the healer didn't have to waste mana on healing squishy dps.
---
She's gonna say no there is no point in asking. Unless I show her something that she'll atleast find mildly interesting.
---
Now. The price is already crashing
---
Nobody's triggered, it's just not a good joke.
---
4 hours.... My first time, we went in as level 54 group. About 10 hours later we finally sat on the throne, close to or at level 60. Multiple reagent/spell learning runs included.
---
Man, those were the days.
---
As a note of reference, back in 2005 at EU start, the least played class was initially Priest. A few months in it switched however and Druids and Warlocks being the least played sometimes the one then the other.
---
Unfortunately I don't know how to get the old wowcensus to display that timeframe again, even though I'm sure they still have the data from then.
---
That's the issue. I don't trust them not to fucking ruin it. It's why classic+ sounds great on paper, but in practice I have zero faith. Everyone dont forget, blizzard IS Activision. This is the company that puts microtransactions above all, pretend the blizzard back during wows release doesn't exist anymore(because it doesnt) would you trust Activision to make classic+? I sure as fuck wouldn't. Look at bfa.
---
On your main hand or 2 handers, you have 9% chance to miss. You can compensate your miss chance with % chance to hit or with weapon skill that gives few percent chance to hit.
---
But if there is a difference between your weapon skill and the target defense skill of nore than 10, there will always be one 'incompressible' percent chance to miss, doesn't matter how much hit chance you have.
---
So if your target has 315 in defense skill (5 points by level, it's a mob level 63 aka a raid boss or a player with defense stats) there is 1% hit you cannot compensate with hit chance.
---
Now, if you have a weapon skill racial or this very item, you can compensate up to 9% chance to miss on a raid boss.
---
Hence, this item being crazy.
---
you can think about the future and still enjoy what's happening right now, that statement you made makes absolutely  no sense.
---
:D
---
Mob levels as in if they're higher levels it'll tick for less.
---
Not to mention it was ugly and depressing, at least Dalaran was somewhat decent place to hang out.
---
Wasn't it in wrath?
---
Reality of being behind the curve.
---
Ahead of the curve: All quest objectives available, all quest mobs avaliable, all gatherables available.
---
On the curve: No mobs in sight - better be playing class with instant ranged damage spell. No gatherables.
---
Behind the curve: Mobs and gatherables available, but you get dicked on by on the curve players - one of the reasons why they are not ahead is because they waste time doing that sort of stuff.
---
I am not sure which one I prefer of the latter two :/
---
This is legit! Is it bad that most of my notes will simply be "Nope"?
---
Not everyone wants to sit in dungeons all week.
---
Well done OP!  I’m def going to be coming back to this map
---
That's why he should pick the other one up, then go back to town and sell it. I mean you are just so stupid I don't even know why I talk to you.
---
You claim to cite spreadsheets, but googling turns up literally nothing when trying to search any one of these. Do you have links? Vidda? Nowhere to be found. Uggen? Nowhere to be found. Bloodmoon? Nowhere to be found. What gives? I would love to see this mage one, but I am doubting its existence. It is not in the mage theorycrafting discord either.
---
I want to see some totally new stuff, like a dungeon in the deeprun tram, or a pirate island off of stv.  Something new and fun but not enough to mess up the lore.
---
I recall a video by Melderon where he discovered it does not buff totem damage, only the talent in ele can do that by giving your fire totems double crit.
---
People of all ages play WoW and that's fine. I was 13 when i played classic just before TBC came out and probably took it a lot more serious back then in terms of trying to do shit as fast as possible. I fall into that adult category now and have little free time but honestly it doesn't bother me so much i'm fine coming on and just doing what I can in a reasonable amount of time now.
---
Thought so.
---
Congrats! I got a tiny Crimson farming less than an hour!
---
I've been using the retail version of MoveAnything on Classic, seems to work fine
---
Classic Expansions all the way, I’d love to end it on Wrath.
---
I just hope they hire on people who write RPGs for the story, and let them control where Classic+ goes. Write it like the Warcraft series, players will fill in the World part :p
---
Somebody going to tell him?
---
Lol and there was an add-on to increase nameplate distance, doesnt make it okay, dummy.
---
If I can get one with a pop top spot that could work
---
Its just an angry screaming sound. Some frogs make a similar sound, combined with the popular meme-frog character Pepe.
---
Last pserver we did AV exalted in less then a weekend. All you need is to find a premade that will rush wins. Basicaly PvE the hell out of that PvP Battleground for maximum rep/hour. :D
---
&gt; It's not a fight, it's a fact.
---
Yeah! Get him!
---
Another snide, bullshit comment. Gee wiz, I can’t say I’m surprised. 
---
Also, speaking of overused, that boyfriend remark lmao. Nice trol u fkn bitch
---
You can just trade it to them.
---
Any Deviant Art links?
---
"Outland without flying"
---
Sounds dumb.
---
My point is there was no castbar built into the game by default, but an add-on made it possible for there to be one.
---
That means it's not Classic then?
---
Plenty of hunters on my server. Hunters, rogues and mages in loads. Most warriors gave up while lvling so they were rarer at 60
---
No I most definitely want tbc and wotlk, however, I believe there are many solutions to address this issue, some being able to copy characters over to the new tbc or wotlk servers for example, while leaving the classic server intact for example.
---
Yo that Tyrande cosplay with the tiger is legit as fuck
---
She makes my champion arise.
---
Rank 1 is the lowest rank you can have without being unranked.
---
Wirken in 1.5s!
---
No.  Blizzard knows that retail and classic players are interested in different styles of game.  Classic+ would allow them to branch WoW in a direction which is different from retail.
---
Basically they're competing for the attention of two different types of game players.
---
Believe it or not, Blizzard is still full of talented employees who want to make a good product.  And they've been on the ball lately listening to and responding to community feedback.
---
Let me also reiterate the fact that i did say a couple of minutes. I'm not talking about people walking away for twenty to thirty minutes with no warning. That shit annoys everyone n

Yes do dungeons. Cathedral will have a nice necklace and you can even need  on the tissue hat

I was 20 when WoW was released so I cant say I grew up playing it. But I am a developer now. Stop making me feel old.

---
Bro, I’m *ALREADY* getting advertisements on YouTube about power leveling services. “We get your character from 1-60 in 7 days guaranteed!”
---
Like WTF? Eat my ass, I enjoy leveling. I hate these kinds of “services”.
---
Okay then
---
Yes, what you’re saying is true and it accurately refutes something they said, but their general point still totally stands: Activision is going to want to know how they can suck more money out of this thing, and “don’t do anything” is probably not going to be an answer that goes over well.
---
IIRC its been confirmed that all of that audio that is out there is fake
---
MOP actually
---
Generally items go to what will benefit the guild in raids 1st before being given out to offspecs or pvp.
---
Cant tell you how many times I've killed horde and theyve had their friends just watch them die as well. Your experience isnt unique, it's just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.
---
Amy's Blanket,Plated Fist of Hakoo, Ring of Sutarn(blue cloth belt, may have mixed up the name), Fiery Waraxe, crimson whelp, emerald whelp. Times have been good.
---
You forget that Diablo 3 exists
---
Its Stormwind now but It will slowly shift toward Ironforge as more people start doing Blackrock Mountain.
---
Bet that hunter who bought them is super pleased.
---
Deviates and Sagefish have been selling for me, have had to hang on to blackmouth. Firefin sells ok. Sagefish have been very consistent, more than deviates even. Making more money hitting floating wreckage pools though.
---
No thank you. That was all part of the flavor. Rebalancing would completely change the experience.
---
we need a new flair ... "complain"
---
I have the macro at home. It's possible. I don't have it with me at the moment but its something like
---
/cast [nostance] Cat Form
---
/cast cat form
---
See if that works.
---
Oh sad. I thought I'd found something new! Thanks for finding that though, good for posterity!
---
Its REALLY good.
---
GE and overpowered gold making bosses has made runescape a cess pool of farming gold killing the same boss on repeat then buying gear or banking exp instantaneously, it's not even remotely close to 2007 scape and only proper way to play the game is ironman which makes the game essentially a solo player game with occasional group content
---
10/10 troll. You can't pick two of them up, so you've just been trolling me this whole time, congrats on wasting your time and mine.
---
Blizzard execs signed off on Classic. They are capable of doing something we like.
---
Of course they do.
---
I'm just telling you what I do and what I experience.
---
If you can quote me where I say the horde doesn't, that'd be great.
---
I'll wait.
---
Isn't the movie actually Beetlejuice though? I know he plays Betelgeuse.
---
Np
---
Sometimes mashing that does not even interupt a mob cast :D
---
But yeah, it is better then nothing :)
---
Show me where the mage touched you on this doll.
---
It’s simpler than that.
---
-if you have a family, the family will expect you to use your vacation time with them.
---
-if you don’t have a family, vacation time for gaming is normal and what else are you gonna do with it really?
---
-past a certain age, reminding people you don’t have a family feels awkward
---
I've played wotlk on a p server for YEARS. I wouldn't mind having a bigger playerbase but the same content. Lich King it is. Naxx, Ulduar, ICC, dungeon browser... Just enough but not too much. It was the sweet spot
---
I play US east coast server from Japan only have 200 ms
---
Saying cringy is cringy
---
30m &gt; 27.432m = 30 yards
---
Classic has many great design elements, but let's not pretend it's flawless in every way.
---
I'm thinking one had ranks in Piercing Ice (frost damage boost) and one doesn't? Not sure if that's displayed in the tooltip but it would make sense.
---
I understand it must be painful for you to accept the truth, all you snowflakes are making me sick.
---
Oh sweet, looks like a neat shield never seen that before!
---
10%?
---
Maybe not 50 50 as horde will always have more but im only 23 and ive seen lots of alliance in barrens,tarren mill and stonetalon.
---
In the site it only shows 350 alliances..
---
And not everyone is some mondo cleave dps class
---
I’ve tried being on a wifi away from home and same result
---
Honestly I've leveled a warrior to 44 and a druid to 34, tanked all dungeons while leveling, multiple times each, and here's what I found.
---
Warrior has quicker threat. One revenge and the mob is stuck hitting you. As a druid, you have to wait for your next attack if you wanna generate decent threat.
---
AOE threat was similar imo. Swipe doesn't do a lot of damage and I found tab-maul more effective when tanking 3 mobs. Warrior can cleave, scream and has two taunts. Overall I think they're both similarly effective.
---
Scream aggro was bugged for both, which made them both a lot better at tanking AOE until yesterday.
---
Pulling with hots on you generatrs decent aoe threat for a druid, but you lose all of your rage. Decisions must be made.
---
However, as a warrior I do feel like I have freedom to tank in any playstyle I want. I can cleave, 2H, shield, thunderclap, tab-sunder, switch and use sweeping strikes, pull a whole room and use retaliation, if a mob had very high armor I can still generate static threat from sunder/revenge, because their threat is not based on damage, I find it a lot more fulfilling and I think I can adapt to any kind of pull in a way I just can't as a druid.
---
Even if a druid has more versatility as a class, I think warrior has a lot more versatility as a tank. And I do value that a lot more.
---
Bet that wasn't pretty.
---
On behalf of a warrior that solo quested without doing most instances, thank you ;)
---
One of the biggest mistakes people have had when considering a rogue since vanilla all the way up to BFA is their role.
---
In PVE its damage and people think in PVP its the same, its not.
---
Rogues are all about control, even in large battles they can impose more control on the battlefield then any other class. 
---
Yes they are great for ganking and can pump out serious damage depending on the spec, but their real value is the control
---
Has anyone else seen this trend in EVERY game lately????
---
Player A clears out the content, rushes through everything, runs out of stuff to do until everyone catches up, and complains on what ever community site is availible.
---
Player B takes his time, does whatever, also checks the community site, and complains about player A's complaints.
---
It's almost funny at this point.
---
Well hello there sailor, what’s your name?
---
Look at the damage meters in vanilla, it's literally just mage/rogue/warr and nothing else. 
---
9 classes but only 3 are viable for endgame dps. Excellent class design /s
---
In the AMA.  They hinted that TBC minus flying mounts is a possibility, too.
---
Just google priest end game raiding builds ..... You do know about google lol just saying
---
And it's way better for PvP/farming.
---
Guild name “ Get Skull Foxed “ please elaborate lol.
---
Haha but why! So many tendies
---
How about no?
---
I don't spare rogues anymore, too many backstab issues. :P
---
You’re honestly gonna compare one of the biggest MMO’s to a platformer? Your thought process is unsettling, can’t take this thread seriously.
---
Um what? You state 30 yard = 27.432m and 30m is more than 27.432m, it follows that 30m is more than 30 yard
---
That's so fucked up, it sounds almost plausible.
---
Seriously US fellas, go metric.
---
I don’t remember my specific spec in Vanilla with my rogue but I topped damage meters and was a monster (1v1) in pvp using daggers. Bleeds and strategy were my friends. There are going to be better specs for both pvp and pve but as a rogue going with a pve spec can still be very viable in pvp.
---
A combo of the last 2. I want burning crusade servers. Everyone I know plays horde but I just want to make a paladin. Also BC was my favorite expansion
---
I had a friend with a rogue called Assbutt that got forced to change.
---
This is pretty dependent on group. I ran SM with a group who could only do very small pulls and the xp was much worse than me grinding mobs on my own.
---
Wait Shamans still flametongue daggers and use a shield? I thought that shit was trash
---
sure leave the guy on the left totally in the dark of whats to come for him. as if that dude ain't gonna have any problems lol
---
Good idea.
---
Personally want Classic Expansions only cause I loved TBC and WotLK but Classic+ seems fun too
---
There's nothing wrong with convenience and quality of life changes on the surface. You can make arguments like that about every change from here to BFA.
---
I will take my time so give me about 10 years and then we can talk about Classic+
---
I take every opportunity that is presented to me to gank Alliance. 
---
I lose a lot. But it's fun trying.
---
Classic expansions. I can’t wait to play the lich king again
---
as long as they dont need healing before i get full mana. drinks are too expensive to waste on impatient tanks
---
It will break incap, yes. Depends on what the stun is but should work on rogue stuns except maybe blind?
---
I'll have to find a rogue and see what exactly but I know sap works and cheap shot should too
---
In classic, it’s the DPS’s job to manage threat.
---
That is a centaur. Orcs hate centaur. There, we can lock this thread now.
---
You shouldn't ever be getting hit enough for Mark of the Chosen to proc, especially in harder dungeons (where if you're getting hit, you're either dead or vanishing).  Use Rune of the Guard Captain.
---
It's a video game with monsters.
---
100% fuck option number one, the other two are hard to decide onnnn
---
I did some LFG in retail before classic dropped.  The only player interaction I had was one guy calling another a retard.  Fun!
---
I remember levelling there on my troll hunter in BC. I was BM, and would just hide behind trees and send my pet in to solo alliance players. Good times.
---
The jump that separates boys from men.
---
In classic, you always have access to all of your abilities from every spec. You have all three talent trees available to you, and 51 talent points that you can distribute however you'd like. Most people usually focus on one talent tree and then throw a couple extra points into one of the other two. Sometimes there are builds that go half and half between two trees, etc.  For example, here is a rogue build with all 51 points spent, most are in combat so that you can have that very last talent, with the leftover in assassination for the first few talents. 
---
If you ever want change where you put your talent points, it costs gold every time, and gets expensive very fast, I believe up to 50g or so each respec. Switching between two specs often is not viable and would require farming for gold to do it.
---
I didn't realize roar got nerfed too :(
---
Oh yeah, I'm sure it's just *terrible*.

Looking for an alt to play while my brother and I cannot progress together on our mains (I am warrior, he is hunter). I would like to have something that is easier to level/play by myself that also doesn't have a difficult time finding groups for dungeons. What are your guys' recommendations for what might fill that role adequately?
---
I agree with you. My son is autistic, and that in itself is not offensive.
---
"Retard" though should be wiped from everyone's vocabularies, yet somehow, noone seems to be offended by THAT word.
---
An eye for an eye and the whole world will be blind.
---
You go from 300 wep skill to over 305. This puts your yellow hit cap from 9% to 6% as well as massively reducing the glancing blow damage penalty (from ~40% to ~7% iirc). 
---
Keep in mind this only affects 1h weapon skill.
---
sounds like a solid plan, gona try
---
The Kalphite Queen was released in 2004 as a raid boss up until 2006 when power creep allowed her to be soloed.
---
60 max level. Progression via gear in new instances. New instances are initially revamped levelling instances that don't get as much use as max level. EG Marudon raid version - 30 man. Gnomeregan raid version - 20 man. These dungeons are in the theme of vanilla wow where as the BC dungeons started to drift away to the 100% winged, lifeless dungeons.
---
Take note of the gear vs consumables from ej and have each dungeon as a grind to gear up for the next one. Static 60, in comparison to leveling which essentially resets things. This makes balancing easier long term and keeps abilities static to a degree. After Naxx start stripping buffs from players and balance around this instead.
---
Perhaps once a few new naxx+ raids exist some five-ten man content with naxx equivalent drops could be implemented in order to give more casual players some content. This would then allow fast tracking of people who want to raid close to cutting edge without them being required to play older content.
---
I dunno, the levelling aspect seems to screw with stuff. Keep it 60 and work from there.
---
And farming soul shards
---
I mained one in Vanilla when I was 18 and remade him on Classic now at 32. Got him to level 22, but the commitment is heavy. I don't have the kind of time I used to have and It's a slow leveling class that's not that fun with a rotation focused on one spell and auto attack. 
---
He is sort of parked in Ironforge until I work up the determination to continue.
---
For now I'm having a lot of fun and making more enjoyment of my limited time with a Hunter.
---
I have the 16 slot ribblys quiver from brd and i have yet to run out.
---
Hahaha sure dude, its like talking to a brick wall, you have a trouble seeing your own toes you fat fuck, you ain't see shit.
---
Agreed, pre-raid bis is different and if you are given an item like that you need to equip it immediately (as you did) to prove to the group you arent going to sell it.
---
DD RPPVP

They tried to make me go to retail, but I said "Noooo nooo noooo"
---
Refreshing posts while working..
---
SPOILERS!!
---
Unless they can kill you nearly instantly after dismounting or stunlock to death, you won't kill them.
---
In optimal conditions, i agree. But vv bubbling at 1 percent vv hp left is basically impossible, so count atleast 10 percent out on both times. I am not trying to invalidate your math, but i believe it becomes 8.4k. And optimal conditions. Priests and shamans can dispel vv bubble, priests can dispel your dots aswell. While mages can remove curses, and poly the vv, warriors can fear vv which might (?) make it impossible to bubble with it. A lot of other classes have good counters, dispels etc aswell. So it isn't as set in stone as you might think.
---
Yep. It's just stupid to not group up for kill quests or quests where you need to kill a single named mob for some quest item.
---
These are some solid tips! Thanks!
---
Actually tanking the level 60 5 mans isn't really viable as anything but a Warrior.  Soloing lower level dungeons is probably easiest as a Paladin.
---
How do I assign hotkeys to the actionbar above the main one?
---
I have played a lot of MMOs and the value of my character and my enjoyment of the game are always there even though I know I will not be playing this game forever.
---
That happened to me the first time around. I hit level 60 like a week before the release of TBC and therefore didn't really get to experience any level 60 content (except for one half run of LBRS). So when TBC was released I focused a lot on leveling so I could actually experience the content as it came out.
---
And I can't say that I don't already feel that subscribing for classic might as well not happen because I'm "behind" and wouldn't be able to play enough to keep up with the content ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The people whining for changes are the new kids. Most of us are part of the group that fought to bring classic back. &lt;- new kids don't understand what that means. People don't understand that most of us know exactly what we wanted when we signed that nostalrius petition.. that we've all been playing this on private servers anyway for the last 10 years.
---
Whatever they do, stop with Wrath. Don't fucking touch anything after Wrath. Give me my Wrath and leave it the fuck alone.  
---
Even playing Classic, I still play more on private Wrath servers.
---
People who have mounts with no or low professions.. any tips?
---
Why there?
---
Don’t press cheap shot? :)
---
ty
---
what is his name?
---
The problem with that it's very hard sometimes to press some button _and_ keep moving at the same time. For example, if I need to keep moving right, and press an ability bound at F, I can't do that, I have to stop moving.
---
Binds on mouse get rid of this issue completely.
---
Nice to see you lurking here, good luck with the Eye drop! :)
---
Classic Expansions.
---
It is still a very noticeable imbalance when there's a lot of players on a server
---
But that's like my only attack. I mean yeah when I'm tanking I sunder and mostly use revenge. But when I'm questing though, what else should I spend it on?
---
They don't in retail, they do in classic
---
Killjoy
---
Same. Two friends started playing, one is still going strong, one got to 24 and hasn't logged on in a week.
---
I never expected rapid drop-off in 1 to 2 weeks. Let's see how the population looks in 6 months to a year.
---
Where did you hear this? Leveled a shaman? Rockbitter for slow, flametounge for fast weapons. Windfury sucks while questing because you won’t get a single WF proc until the mob is at 10% health and then you triple crit them to hell. 
---
Flametounge is perfectly fine, and clearly better with a new rank of it. If anything WF weapon is the worst one for a shaman.
---
god I want her to yell at me in a language I don't understand, mind control me and crush me into dust. Whitemane is best girl.
---
It’s 3.2%, not 1.8%, use [the right formulas](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table).
---
They have years of being spoon fed dungeon content to overcome. Retail really destroyed/changed dungeon runs not just in WoW but many MMOs that followed their lead.
---
Well for one, there's a spell rank displayed right there. And for two, level obviously would matter as your stats actively increase with your level, not just your gear. 
---
In this case, however, if it is classic, the level wouldn't make a difference as it's at level cap for classic. Stats on gear, however, would.
---
Thid comment makes no sense to me. Does that mean that right now you feel like you have to keep up up until AQ because you know for a fact that there is still content after AQ
---
Not to mention that you do NOT know that there will be no content after Naxx. Even Blizzard themdelves said they are open to the idea, at least regarding TBC
---
FOR THE HOOOOOOOOOOOOOORDE!!!
---
What addon displays players' names in their class color?
---
I know :( Im a terrible person
---
how do you get class colours in the normal blizzard chat?
---
Blast from the past.
---
The deleted comment said something along the line of "that's when the spell becomes available".
---
can you not post weird furry shit to this sub thanks
---
&gt; This is the time to look at what is working, why it's working, and not break it. 
---
See I don't get this. This is WHY people are asking about what comes next. We're looking at the game, trying to see what it can be. No one is trying to change it immediately, we're promoting discussion and thought around the community. Everyone is so up in arms like the players are the ones that are changing the game. 
---
You want to look at what the game is and why it's working? Let the community discuss that then.
---
I think classic+ is the correct route. There are a few caveats that should be set in stone in order to keep it feeling like classic. 
---
1) No new cities. Keep the hubs where they are.
---
2) No non-azeroth bullshit. Going into space? No. Random giant ass continents popping up in the middle of the ocean? Nope. Fill in existing azeroth.
---
3) Do not raise the level cap or overhaul talents. Minor tweaking sure. 
---
4) Don't go insane with stats. The gear should be upgrades, but not literally double vanilla gear stats. Sulfuras should remain a truly amazing weapon for years for example. 
---
5) keep trade skills clean/consistent. We don't need "content patch 5 mining" or new crap every single time new content comes. Just add a couple patterns and call it good. 
---
Overall I love the idea of classic+ as long as it keeps to the feel and theme of classic. I think that polling the players would be the best way to do that. 
---
We thought we did, and we do.
---
Got me!
---
As someone who recently learned what best in slot means, is this a meme?
---
Yeah I use a weapon swing timer as well. That's how I could tell my shots and stings would sometimes eat my auto shots.
---
I mean, you're also welcome to stfu and let people talk about what they want to talk about.  Ludicrous..
---
Its kinda the same thing. one thing is just more expensive but honestly might as well roll need on everything. I have passed on the epic level 36 shield as tank used it and equipped it.
---
Agree 10000%, TBC felt like...a part of classic already because it truly didn't change the game in a terrible way. I can understand people maybe not liking the game after WOTLK+ but I really do feel like TBC evolved the game in a very clean way. I dont know how else to put it, the TBC private servers were a gigantic hit too.
---
I love how mad people get over this. This shit was straight up wallhack. Good job blizzard.
---
Good thing that this is World of Magecraft and you'll be slowed or rooted in 98% of the cases.
---
Honestly, I tried to look but couldn’t find the option.
---
It is my humble opinion that flying mounts destroyed the social aspect and the ‘world is huge’ feeling within the game.
---
Not had a single one on my server yet
---
You need 175 and tons of 50+ fishing lures. Recommend getting 200 in Tanaris before pools so you don't fail. But yeah easily 15+ gold/hr.
---
I play warrior and I feel your pain. This is one of my pet peeves but I just keep telling myself it’s lowbie dungeons and it won’t always be this way.
---
And the longing for world conquest
---
Until they day he doesn't (return). Which was kinda the point that those dependancies are stupid (and lazy).
---
Lol druid tank
---
I see alot of people comparing it to osrs. I see the comparison but you need to remember that this is blizzard. If they did do a classic+ I'm worried it would go down the shitter so fast. I wouldn't mind playing BC or LK. It would be nice to have more end game options with raiding. Personally ICC was my favorite.
---
Frostblitz sounds so much cooler than Frostbolt.
---
Prat. Its a chat addon
---
Thanks my fries were missing something
---
Please I want to be on your server. The alliance are dicks
---
Bro relax, there's nothing wrong with already discussing future theories. It's going to be at least 2 years until they take that step.
---
Flametounge is not trash at all. Scales with spellpower so it’s the optimal choice for ele, and puts out consistent dps with a fast weapon. Whereas rock bitter gets more benefit from a slow weapon. 
---
Also using dagger+shields allows you to be more durable while soloing. Less damage taken is less time healing.
---
After Mankrik's wife, I usually just go to Redridge mountains for a bit, then duskwood, then a couple easy STM quests on my way to Desolace. I know a lot of players hate Desolace but it was always my favorite zone until Un'Goro.  Helping wage the Centaur war was always a blast for some reason, and I think that quest line is like 80% of the experience in that zone haha.
---
Studio version of a demo. Not too exciting but it's new!!
---
Yeah I'm in Tanaris and I'm level 35..
---
A guy on our server is looking for 1200g
---
there is a reason i take 5 hours to level, i need to clean up after others!
---
Very nicely done !
---
Horde have always been the more aggressive pvp players in my experience. 
---
They're definitely the more popular faction, so that has something to do with it too I think. 
---
I really don't mind it when I get camped and what not because at the end of the day it fuels my horde hunting energy when I decide I want to go and knock them around for a change.
---
Yeah....fresh account, totally not my main...

Yeah I'm always reading 210 then it hits me for 260.

Hold till people have gold

I feel OK. I didn’t even realize demo roar was creating too much threat, so I wasn’t crutched with it. Swiping away as per tradition.
---
The "White Mane" is her bush

Versus 63 lvl (boss)
---
misschance for 300 ws: 7%+(315-300-10)\*0.4%=9%

misschance for 305 ws (human or spec): 5%+(315-305)\*0.1%=6% (that's a huge gap, when the difference lesser than 10)

misschance for 307 ws: 5%+(315-307)\*0.1%=5.8%

---
misschance for warrior human specced into swords  (300+5+7+5) : 5%+(315-317)\*0.1%=4.8%
---
It seems it doesn't give so much hit if you picked right race and/or pick necessary talent and +1% hit hands are better, I don't see many of those items though.
---
Keep true classic but add ARENA!!!
---
It’s been out for two and half weeks, if that’s behind to you, you’ve got other problems to deal with.
---
For anyone new to wow, alt+z will hide your UI
---
Explain me please, when proc effects are applied: when you start to cast a spell, when you finish casting it or when a spell hits a target (if projectile hits not instantly)? 
---
Is this mechanic the same in different patches (vanilla, bc, wotlc, pandaria &amp; so on)?
---
These are used to make fire oil for fire protection potion (maybe fire resistance potion) I am selling these for 75S EACH on my server it’s a gold mine here. Oily black mouth good too for free action

Currently it's a little over 60% to a little under 40% balance, but when there are 50k players on the server that 20% becomes a huge difference. Yes there's data to back those numbers up as well... On my phone currently so can't link.
---
Report the user, this will likely help blizz stop this.
---
I mean in terms of physicality :P. I'm sorry your Forsaken misses being a Human. All you have to do is stand up straight. But I guess the lack of abdominal muscles and all.

This needs more attention. 
---
I had a dwarf priest healing me last night and I was LoS pulling everything. HE would MIND BLAST mobs and dot them while I was doing that. 
---
... then of course we had to wait on his mana every pull.
---
I'm pretty new to the game and I'm rolling a troll priest. I have a greater magic wand, and have learned that my main hand weapon is just gonna be a stat booster, but I can't equip staves. Is there an npc that can teach me to use staves?
---
You can also get from 11/12 to 20 in Darkshore alone.
---
Boneboy is talking out his ass. The shouts were changed a day or two ago but they're not useless for threat. Demo shout applies a set amount of threat to every mob in range. Battle shout applies a certain amount of threat that scales with how many allies are affected by it split amongst each enemy. Lets say, for example, each ally affected generates 25 rage and there are 3 allies in range. You will generate 100 threat (I think you count but I'm not 100%) but that is split between the 2 enemies that are on everybody's threat table. So you get 50 threat to each enemy. 
---
So demo shout is still good for many enemies and battle shout is good when there is a high ally:enemy ratio. Battle shout was better threat gen than sunder in some situations before the hotfix.I bet its still the case but who knows
---
Different ranks of shouts generate different threat
---
The shout talents do not affect threat
---
I got ganked by 2 humans yesterday (at the same time, twice) that were 6-7 levels above me. Whats your point? Some people gank others and some don't. It's a PvP server so they don't do anything wrong, it's part of the game. Obviously for rogues in general it's easier to prey on others since they can remain undetected and wait for the right moment until they attack you.
---
That's weird I'm actually cringing as I read *your* comment. 0.o

Serioulsy, the quest limit on the quest log is probably the thing I hate the most
---
Should be the dreaming whelps in the swamp of sorrows
---
&gt; people like MMOs because they are always evolving games and those people know that they wont stick around after Naxx, not for long at least. 
---
This opinion is part of the problem. I've played on emulated servers for games being capped for 3+ years before and believe it or not the servers GREW during that time, not shrank.
---
The people that need to constantly be consuming new content are why otherwise great MMOs ultimately turn to trash, whether it's 3 years later or(as in WoWs case) much later after that. 
---
It's hard to meet the demands of people that are going to be at end game for a grand total of 1 week before moving on, release content at a pace to keep them interested, and not massively fuck up at some point. 
---
I don't think that classic should remain static forever(although I do think that option should be there for those who wish it) but I absolutely dread to think that the devs are going to release a ton of content to keep the top 10% happy until it ultimately is as fucked of a game as retail is. 
---
Very slow and very steady is the only shit it has at longevity. Let the 1% go play other games if they're not enjoying it. The content is supposed to be stale/all known. That's the entire point, that's what the community was asking forall these years.
---
are we at the point where we make up fictive scenarios so we can shit at retail players? the video is well made but everyone who enters a dungeon in classic knows to not pull much.
---
There are more like those who do it but I cant remember the name.a
---
That's a fair point I'm not going to argue against.  
---
Most of my experience with LFG comes from the WotLK datadisk though and it was a godsend for me there. I was in a guild, I loved my guild and I gave it everything. So it's not like I was this antisocial single player. But not long after leveling up, it started to be a pain in the ass to actually find 5 people willing to do a dungeon run. People got their first epic set, started getting geared in raids, and they stopped going to dungeons, stopped queuing for LFG even. Myself, I was doing LFG almost daily through the entire datadisk, tanking for unequipped strangers with my tier 9 or whatever dps gear and loving it.  
---
Had the feature not been in the game, I would have to put together parties in /trade or /lfg and I fucking hate those global channels with a passion. Even now while leveling in classic I only join /lfg in order to find a party for a dungeon and then I leave it as soon as I get an invite.  
---
So what I'm saying is I can see how LFG may be the beginning of a slippery slope, but I personally have nothing but great experience with it, it didn't detract from my social/guild experience either. Again, my guild was amazing and I still remember they days fondly.
---
The best part was the [photo-op on the watchtower](https://imgur.com/gallery/nU96vs5)  where we all waited for a speech
---
Classic + with community voting on new updates pleeeeeeease.
---
If you don't have 20 minutes to dedicate to a dungeon then go solo...
---
Don't waste other people's time.
---
Now imagine you are not only undead rogue but female undead rogue. Certainly gay in OP's eyes.
---
Literally unplayable.

\*cancels subscription\*
---
Lol, in need of life support.
---
The only solution i can see is bliz offering free character transfers to a normal server so you can do all the endgame content
---
Someone in China blindly copied something without thinking?! This has never happened before! ;)
---
But quests give rep and that can be a harder grind sometimes if you want to get a different faction mount or something.
---
Don’t feel like that. I’m 40 already (just dinged last night! No chance at mount for prolly another 10 though) and honestly feel like I’m going way faster than I originally did but I don’t feel like I’m rushing at all. There’s nothing to rush for since we know what comes after! It’s not like people are suddenly going to stop running Stocks or something so you’ll always have people running around with you. Classic is only three weeks old, can you even believe it?
---
2/10 wnb
---
What are the grouping rules around level. At what level can i group with a 60 and get full exp?  If a lvl 60 and lvl 40 are in a dungeon together and mobs are level 40 will the 40 get full exp? I thought there would be restrictions but i saw a 60 mage streaming ZF kills with all lower levels and they were claiming 100xp /h
---
Be in party with someone outside the dungeon. You then logout and your party member resets, then you login again.
---
Just a pro tip, you don’t have to make the highest level water. Just make someone a stack of 20 downgraded, especially if they’re being jerks about it
---
I play on Gandling too and I've not noticed it being as bad as you say. Sometimes I'm questing in a zone and there are no horde around, only alliance. And when horde do turn up, the alliance gank them to hell. Other times I'm the only alliance person questing and the horde gank me to hell.
---
Yeah, I could...but as Ive reached the 30s now, that problem seems to be less. Either tanks are getting better or they are finally generating more threat.
---
Some many people dont understand this.
---
waiting patiently for the inevitable *"my wife/autistic gf/disabled daughter made me a cake/cupcake/painting/baked good with the horde/alliance logo!"* posts
---
Not talking about the crypt. If you cast far right or eagle on just right on the actual building Karazhan you could clip through and see the terrain under it and theres a big smiley face.
---
I don’t know if it’s just me but I have imp Blizz 3/3 and it seems like my clump of mobs will run through the second and third round of Blizz and won’t slow down or take damage until they’ve reached the end of the rune circle diameter and it’s too late.
---
I will gather the mobs, Frost nova, run or blink, do the first blizzard fine as they’re still trapped and it’s working, but when I get ready for the next blizzard, I will cast it before the mobs enter the next rune circle and they will run through it and won’t take damage until they’ve reached the other side, as if it’s super delayed or something. 
---
I will say though that I’m playing across the world from the server location so my ping isn’t the best, but could ping really be the reason why this is happening? The lag and ping isn’t really that awful. I started thinking it was bad spell batching (similar to perplexitys beta demonstration with blizzard) but everyone I talk to doesn’t really have this issue, which makes me think it is my ping.
---
Historically though, the top 1% is what keeps a game alive. No game just has a casual population and stays healthy. 
---
Not that I’m saying they should immediately drop everything and cater to them, but they need to be thinking about the next carrot to drop infront of them.
---
I miss fuckin enhancement from.Cata and MoP. It's so watered down today but back then was the most exciting flashy spec in the game. What a shame they turned it into what it is in BFA...
---
no you don't get it
---
we want classic as it is, we never want it to change
---
I don't want to play anything else for the rest of my entire life
---
every time I quit wow was because of new content (either addons or big content patches) because everything I achieved over the years and month was suddenly worthless (because of new loot or new max lvl etc)
---
I don't want any of this bullshit I want this game, as it is, forever.
---
Calm down mate, I've obviously picked a bad example.
---
Regardless, this is still lazy design since for Ret it was removed and just added as a talent.
---
Have a friend as leader of your group, when you've killed her, log out have them reset the dungeon and log back in. You should now find your self at the waterfall as if you just entered using the scepter.
---
Horde: So you need to travel to the other continent? Cool, the zepplins are over there.  
---
Alliance: So you need to travel to the other continent? Fuck you, the only dock we have is on the wetlands so you better start running and if you are low level I hope you enjoy aggro'ing every single mob on the way there.
---
Suffering is an aoe taunt and the blueberry lives a hell of a lot longer. I've survived aggroing 5 mobs at once thanks to it
---
PvP is PvP! you get your kills where you can.

Fairness has nothing to do with it.

Warlock and hunter pets are very different.  Warlock pets are more like mobile turrets, hunter pets are your own personal mini tank.
---
The bear is just staring at the wall and praying for death
---
I’ll stop pulling more adds when tanks learn to move our current targets out of aggro range.  Until then, if I’m standing behind my target and some extra add paths into my circle and sees my delicious ass staring back, I guess I can’t blame them for coming at me.
---
Shaman is really fun, shame you pretty much have to heal in groups.
---
Yeah I have the same problem as a warrior... level 47 now, and although a lot of things have gotten easier, the dps has gotten a lot stronger too. The main problem is that people can’t just stand still for even 5 seconds. I play with the same group often, and although I have told them what’s going on, they still don’t understand threat mechanics, and don’t care to learn, so I definitely take it less seriously now. 
---
But for those that think the tank “can’t hold agro” it’s often because you don’t know how to dps. Get threat meter, stop doing anything If you have more threat than tank, don’t dps, heal, wand etc mid pull. Everything will go a lot faster and smoother if you just calm down.
---
This has been posted about a hundred times already, we get it..
---
What do you think ruined the game in the first place, blizzard listening to the masses on stupid BS. The cycle will continue at this rate with players asking for more content before it even  launched.
---
Bc next year? Are you all right? Gosh i sure hope so..

You mean that 1 snowball per day?
---
I think some mods do...
---
These are amazing
---
I've been trying battleshout but it honestly never pulls aggro off of anyone by itself. I'm better off using the rage to sunder armor the target instead. Was a bit disappointed tbh :(
---
There was once a time where the game ended after MC, then more content was introduced. Do you consider this a bad idea because then MC gear was eventually becoming worthless? Your argument makes no sense.
---
I always get them once I've made and sent linen bags from my character.
---
It's k. You're alliance. You have the BDE. If you didn't you'd have considered being horde just for the safety.
---
What you're describing is a trade between lucrativeness and business risks - just because you're doing something well (while being reckless), doesn't mean it gets less reckless... Which was kind of the point.
---
I know Blessing of Might does for Paladins with the Improved BoM talent.
---
What did you race to 60 for than?
---
That was painful to read, OP, both of you should be embarrassed.
---
I believe theres a "skip" for that one. You can go to southern ashenvale/northern [zone south of ashenvale] and die in a certain place that teleports you to westfall...I'm not sure if thats the right skip though but thats something to look into
---
What if you slice them in the shape of an F?
---
I never played classic and honestly have only played retail up to the mid 40s on two characters and I’m having a blast with the current content. Something about the setup of the game and lack of QoL made it draw me in and immerse me much better than retail ever did and I’m having an absolute blast. I only have characters at levels 14 and 10 so far due to college and work schedule being rough but I’m playing every chance I get. The current iteration will probably keep me coming back for at least a year.
---
Yeah that is what I was thinking. If people want new content they have to make themselves heard now when there is still at least a year of classic in the pipeline. Any classic plus content would need years of dev time and testing to make sure it fits perfectly into the game.
---
Now dont spend it and you will have your mount at 40 lol
---
The human bonus is only *really* a game-changer on +3 mobs.  Go with the axe, its slow speed and axe spec make it miles better.
---
Horde traitor!! Just kidding... try to do that too actually, but can’t make both faction on a pvp sv.
---
Honestly. You’re right OP. But in low level dungeons it doesn’t really matter. People will rip aggro and they will die. If they rage, replace them. Your job is to keep the healer alive. The heals keeps the group moving. If a dps dies. It’s their fault. And again. They’re replaceable. Let  em go, they’ll learn eventually.
---
I think its different when you are with your guild vs PUG. They understand your needs and want you to get the best gear.
---
You Might? Why are you complaining?
---
Because tribalism is part of the game it's like having a favorite sports team or political party.  Down with alliance!
---
That's pretty much the moment when you start running out of quest, outside of grinding mobs or running dungeons there is little ways to get exp.
---
That physically pains me to hear that.
---
And then the camera is zoomed out an extra 9.36%
---
And thus, alternative markets develop (tankless spellcleave)

I believe Freezing Trap and Feign Death are both on the GCD so you'll need a cast sequence and hit the button twice.

Plenty of people are offended by it. It's just retarded to think that removing that word from the lexicon is gonna stop people from comparing dumb things/people to people with mental disabilities. Did you know idiot used to be a medical term for people with downs syndrome? Should we stop using that one too?
---
&gt;How is aoe grinding getting "carried"?
---
Demo shout was generating about 300% too much threat. It was hot fixed 2 days ago finally. This bug was enabling these farm groups to work. When you have 10 people in a 5 man dungeon killing all the mobs..... it's easy to be carried. Even in a 3 mage healer tank group.
---
&gt;Is questing somehow meant to be more noble and skill-developing that aoe grinding?
---
While questing you have to pvp unless you are on a pve server, in which case I'm not referring to those players as 2.0 is a world pvp patch. 
---
&gt;Implying most mages don't know how to play their class because of the way they've chosen to level literally makes no sense at all.
---
Oh please, dont mistake me, no implication was made. I straight up stated they dont know how to play. Obviously not literally all of them. But most.  Anytime you have an op class, it is going to be filled with idiots who have no clue and are just riding the band wagon.
---
This is not about getting content a week after naxx. I dont care if it takes 6 months, 1 year or 2. Hell, if i was in charge MC and onyxia wouldnt even be out yet. I would give it a month. I really have no desire to rush the content out wathsoever. I just would like to be able to play my favorite game in 5 years and there actually be something to do besides doing BGs against perfect characters all in Naxx BiS gear.
---
I'm not the one with the burden of proof. However I did rewatch the blizzcon thing and they didn't mention what I stated. However this was previously discussed here on ready with a screenshot in the comments of the project lead of vanilla confirming caps of concurrent players.

Could you provide some examples of quests where the location is off?
---
We'd be happy to fix those.
---
Keep in mind though that some NPCs have lot of possible spawns and we're limiting the icons shown on the map to not flood it with icons.
---
Can confirm these approx numbers for my server as well.  The level population looks a little like a bell curve with the median level being around 21.  The VAST majority of people are currently 15-25.  The number of level 60s is less than 0.1%.
---
I see, the way the question was worded seemed worse than you're describing it. Honestly, I feel like she would simply need to try out the different classes for herself and see which one clicks. With that being said I agree with you, Hunter is a very popular choice for new players and the pet aspect is a fun little mini game for some people.
---
Top notch!
---
Was passing thru desolate and saw a low level ally and thought ehhhh then I saw their target was a fellow horde so I one shot mind blasted them :’)
---
But is the speed of light constant?
---
To be difficult
---
I'd bet there's no actual difference in casting range; that's probably just a misleading I18n error.  Way to make a mountain out of a molehill, Chicken Little OP.
---
I wish fear was better. But as i get higher level I find that fearing mobs has a tendency to just aggro more things.
---
This is classic
---
 Threat is just as much your job as the tanks. If you dont understand this, go back to retail.
---
Warrior is the top tank. Druid is viable. These are really your only 2 options past 30. Both operate on rage for threat. So while you can blow your load at the start, neither tank can. Learn how rage works. Learn how to play.
---
Hell, go make a warrior and try tanking. Learn how much of threat is on dps not being stupid retail babies
---
Did he steal your farms or was he just questing..?
---
Strange, must be hit or miss because improved life tap doesn't modify the tooltip.
---
Top Kek!
---
I'd also use Rune of the Guard Captain over Blackhand's Breath until I had more +hit from other sources.
---
Please stop telling people what they are and aren't allowed to discuss. If you want to play the game at your pace and take it slow, that's fine. If others want to speedrun it and already brainstorm what they'd like to see next, that's fine too.
---
I mean it's not too early to show the sentiment that for example people would like to have a BC option, so Blizz can do the do the prep-work to look into it.
---
Personally I do want to eventually progress after Naxxramas, whether that is with a clone to a new BC server or with the entire server upgrading I don't know, but being stuck in T3 for forever would be lame.
---
Because horde are utter scum.
---
I spent my formative years playing as Alliance. From Vanilla, right through to BFA. And if I've learned anything from that, it's that there really isn't a good or a bad side in the faction war. 
---
I rerolled to horde for Classic to see things from their perspective, and I'm really enjoying it so far. 
---
I always played a paladin as Alli, now playing UD mage. I'm not an RPer but I'm telling myself that my paladin was killed and became UD, realised that the real monsters were Paladins that didnt understand the forsaken affliction, and so he's renounced his Paladin ways and turned to the arcane to fight back :D
---
I usually just through Curse of Agony or Corruption on whatever they happen to be fighting. It's like a murder buff, fits the class fantasy better.
---
Damn! XD  didnt think about that
---
This tbh. Except 18 portala will need stones so he should open a couple more for material cost
---
It would deal more damange in that case.
---
You don't know that blink breaks stun and iceblock breaks blind? Ok gl with your pvp mate.
---
&gt;You pull it you tank it.
---
I believe the correct phrase would be 
---
"You spank it you tank it"
---
What is there fun to do at 60?most people even say that levelling is the journey in classic
---
Druid is an oddball since it can't reach defense cap anyways, I'm assuming that with BiS gear you mean a point where ragestarvation doesn't happen, then dodge turns from bad to good. But that doesn't happen till BWL/AQ levels of gear and damage (to the best of my knowledge anyways). And anyways druids can only be Night elves so the argument over which racial is good is bit moot.
---
Exactly! Everyone is new at some point. I'd like to learn to tank, but probably won't ever do it because of attitudes like this. Not everyone has been playing since Classic the first time around. Offering to help someone learn is one thing, trying passive aggressively link a video is completely different. If you see a tank doing something that could be done better, address that issue specifically so they can LEARN. 
---
The tank is always the one who gets blamed when anyone else in the group makes a mistake.  In real life, do people call others "fucking noobs" or "trash" because they make a mistake or are learning something new?
---
It's an iconic weapon (the staff - Benediction) that only priests can get. Requires a drop from a Molten Core boss, a drop from elite demons and a quest in EPL.
---
Or 80 yard fields?

"Royal with Cheese"

Flying is never reasonable. It always kills immersion.

Those cast time reduction talents do not decrease the scaling coefficients. You will still get 100% in your example

You can check his vods, i saw him doing a world pvp raid yesterday, then defending IF from invaders.

---
I *love* this art style. It looks like an animated film. 
---
Please, you must do Alliance quests. There's so much you can cover that has special significance to the leveling experience.
---
Garrick Padfoot in Elwynn.

Iverron in Teldrassil.

Ol' Sooty in Loch Modan.

Just off the top of my head. These would be so cool to see in your art style.

Google wow classic phases. Literally first result. Phase 3. Nobody knows how long will that be but I wouldn’t expect it for at LEAST another 4 months.

Fabulous Bill stitched them back on with thrice-blessed sinew extracted from the virgin mollusks of Vengmar XII, and then the Dark Mechanicum forged Abaddon a new suit of terminator armor with special arm reinforcements. The upside is he now looks properly badass, the downside is he's stuck in a single stance once he puts it on.
---
[He seriously looks like a fucking boss though](https://www.games-workshop.com/resources/catalog/product/threeSixty/99120102101_CSMAbaddon360/01.jpg), such a huge upgrade. GW's been a-retconning again, too, so as to make his track record live up to what his reputation is supposed to be.
---
But upon further consideration, it must have been the Guilliman model, as Abaddon wasn't updated until like March, or maybe April.
---
Hm, amusingly at roughly the same level as you I've not found that to be a big problem most of the time. Hmmm that could be some bad luck on your part.
---
I mean in terms of just blasting dungeons etc.
---
I had fun leveling, and while I put in hours I was exactly following a strict guide.

VanasKoS is probably the best. It's super useful.
---
I read somewhere (wowhead?) that the quest bugs out if several other quests are completed before it.  I can't find it now, but in the comment they said they needed GM assistance.
---
I use an addon called elvui, other addons are also available.
---
Although you're getting the authentic classic experience by seeing shammies as pink just like pallies!
---
It is based of % dmg done

I’m not opposed to it, show Faction, Race, IGN, and Server. Could be cool to see people you know and enemies you’ve slain :p

 All of the old WoW is beloved. More modern expansions added so many features that are unique to that expansion. On top of that, major zone revamps, paired with big story/plot changes, have made the ti.eline consistancy a complete disaster. Parking a bronze dragon npc in the zone to see old versions of the area just doesn't cut it for me. Having several different warcheifs depending on what part of which expansion your working through is messy. Things like abandoned garrisons, artifact weapons, order halls (which had the most wasted potential for future development) and of course this lame heart of azerith. New players are blowing by all of this left wondering wtf to do with it all. Wreckless progression of the story has made WoW as an entire experience suffer greatly as a whole
---
I would love to see a whole new timeline if you will. One that builds on existing, without destroying what came before. Everything added pre cataclysm feels right. The only post cata expansion that also handled this correctly is MoP. Added a unique setting to travel to and quest in without all the useless features that get forgotten (save maybe the farm, but that wasn't a central feature either)
---
The real challenge would be trying to advance a story, while keeping characters mostly where they are. It would be nice to go back to most of the big lore characters being out of the main quest lines. Our adventure should focus on the world and it's problems, not to be a hype man in cut scenes where kings, gods and warlords are interacting. On the same thread, killing plot characters to shake things up has got to stop if they want to maintain any sort of long term constancy. It seems like they are still trying to tell a story in a style that's better suited for an rpg, or rts. Something linear. I just don't think that works with an MMO that has run as long as this, which has resulted in the clusterfrick we have now
---
Does it comes to every country except USA?
---
"pretty good for an alliance player"- "horde infested"
---
Oh, no, I fully agree that ToC was a cesspit of a raid. I actually enjoyed the encounters but despised the setting. Like I said, WotLK had its fair share of failures and detriments. I just think that TBC and Classic do as well.

When I'm at 50% hp 80 % mana I'm 100% ready to go and don' expect a heal
---
If we're being perfectly honest, just the idea of Classic+ is ridiculous. Blizzard aren't going to make new content for the original game.
---
Warlock is advertising themselves as mage, because the current meta is AOE cleaving their way through dungeons. 
---
Warlocks have an aoe that aggroes easy, does not slow enemies, and warlocks have no frost nova, ice block, or other hard way to deal with catching aggro.
---
You can move them without any addons, just unlock and drag them around.
---
Are you on an rp server by any chanche? Ive never seen this tip
---
Same here. I was expecting to quest my way to 60 but I've just kept receiving invites for dungeons left and right.
---
I know right. It took me forever to find exactly what I wanted
---
Happy hydrating
---
I've leveled to 35 on two characters and each time I leveled 13-15 Westfall, 15-18 Loch Modan, and finished 18-20 Westfall very efficiently. Loch Modan is very efficient with a good rotation.
---
Alternatively, Darkshore alone can get you to lvl 19.
---
I don't see that as a strong argument, I look at numbers to evaluate what opponent I'm up against, visuals are secondary or I don't notice anything besides the siluette and spell effects to see what class it is, if, say, I'm attacked. In 1v1 situation I might pay more attention to it, but on a BG or outdoor skrimish with several people I have more important things to think about, and I suppose the same goes for most people.
---
haha i laughed so hard at this at work, also it's pretty epic to see the impact wow has had on our generations :)

---
Been leveling a resto druid and living in instances as a result.  I agree with you 100%.  You can tell the folks who have been here before...they understand the importance of waiting for the tank to build threat.
---
There is also an overuse of AoE, IMO.  Like, yeah, ok, there is a group of three mobs, so blizzard, hellfire, etc might make sense, but it's still going to be FASTER to focus fire the mobs down individually and it's going to save healer mana, which means less drinking, which means less downtime between pulls.
---
I disagree, discussion now is important.
---
You have to give signal to Blizzard to start working out for next xp/classic+. Talking will not change things for a year.
---
It's not a guess when when there's been tens of thousands of swings taken in the Beta to confirm it. There's no formula in the blue post aside from them saying that the first 1% hit will be ignored if you're at 304 or less skill against a 63 mob. Your "this items gives you 0.8% chance to hit from the raw stats" comes from nowhere. That's not how any previously accepted formulas worked either.
---
You have 8% chance to miss at 300 skill plus your first 1% hit is ignored, which means a 9% hitcap.
---
You have 6% chance to miss at 305 skill and there's no hit being ignored. 6% hitcap.
---
My wife had to come check on me after this revaluation
---
Progress there. Westfall is about to be the best leveling place for you until you hit level 20.
---
It shouldn't be added to the game anyway, it's cool having a "raid leader dps cooldown" but it amplifies the "don't use your full rotation because you want all your abilities up for CDs" game play that makes you feel like you're not doing anything when you don't have CDs up.
---
No its taken from the patch with the bugs fixed.
---
I was going to bash this for being misleading because it's from WotLK, but it's actually really neat. I don't think I've ever seen a wow map that actually labels all the subzones before. It's crazy to think just how much there is to the game, both in terms of content and world. I've leveled so many different toons, both horde and alliance, and there's still so many areas on this map I've never seen or noticed before. Unbelievable.
---
Have a 40 mage and 30 hunter. I have always wanted to get into pvp especially BG's but was always put off by how much out geared I was compared to everyone else. Now that everyone is on the same level I think it's my time to really give it a shot. I want to stay on the back line and just snipe people. I love the damage output the mage has and all the CC but being so squishy and constantly being OOM is such a turn off. I very much enjoy the rhythm of the hunter rotation and from what iv seen how they drop caster classes real quick. I know hunters are very popular but I have seen a plethora of mages and warlocks so I figure I could do pretty well. The only thing that turns me off is the dead zone and that I have heard hunters dps drops while pretty much every other class rises and passes them up.
---
TLDR: Always pve now want to pvp BG's
---
Love how mages make things die fast, hate how quickly they die, are always OOM and how overpopulated they are. Does mana problem change at 60 and will BG's be filled with them?
---
Love how Hunters can American Sniper casters especially since locks and mages seem heavily overpopulated, hate dead zone and how other classes outperform them late endgame. Can they still hold their own then and how hard is it to kite people to keep them out of dead zone?

How would People know why there is 15 comments debunking it?
---
Spells do not really scale with Level. How would you do using rank1 frostbolt at 60?
---
It increases in damage that is true but it doesn't scale. Scaling would mean that the damage would increase all the way up to 60. It scales for 4 Levels.
---
I was wrong with that you are right.
---
But if People only read the one comment with 77 downvotes and nothing else (they actually have to open this comment manually) then it is not my fault they get the wrong Information.
---
That would be their own stupidness
---
Mages can break stuns on a 20s cd, and can iceblock out of blind. You're a complete boob and have no idea what you're talking about!
---
You are playing with retail players who think that then having aggro means you are bad when in reality it means they are stupid
---
DPS take more damage from the attacks than the tank which means the healer has to heal more relative to the incoming group damage meaning they go OOM faster which takes way more time that waiting a few seconds for the tank to get aggro
---
German master race
---
Fair enough, if you wanna go for server first, wanna have wasted gear drops like in that naxx example by all means. What i was saying if a guild wont let someone raid the way they want, if they obviously do put the effort in then he/she should change the guild. I play mage and warlock at the moment and honestly wouldnt mind raiding with weaker specs as long as we down the bosses which honestly is not too difficult.
---
This is hyper realistic because he's also doing it with a two-hander.
---
Their general point is a binary fallacy. Classic+ is more likely than Nothing. That doesn't mean Classic+ is likely...let alone inevitable. There are plenty of options other than Nothing and Classic+. 
---
Lowest risk and might look good on paper is just releasing new classic servers and doing the seasonal bullshit. This would probably fall flat but might entice a boardroom sitter.
---
Relatively low risk (and cheap) and likely more successful would be a re-release of classic expansions. This could also be paired with pure Classic servers you can free transfer too and some that are fresh starts. Money can also be made off of the people who transfer to the pure Classic experience and then decide they want that character to experience BC (server transfers aren't cheap).
---
Classic+ content is pretty high risk (it might make no one happy) and costs new art development and design time (as well as the technical work that any method but server resets requires). Classic+ could be BIG but boardroom execs aren't known to gamble.
---
Boo I think this would be epic!
---
Thunder Bluff, Org, and Undercity all have weapon trainers that will train different weapons.  You won't have a lot of new options as a priest but if some classes have tons, like warriors.  Each new type costs money, mostly 10s each I think but some are more.  Each trainer teaches a different set of skills, so you might have to do some travelling to get the ones you want.  I think staff is in Org if I remember right, so should be easy enough this time around.
---
Twenty minutes? My last dungeon run was almost two hours...
---
When it takes you 3 years to reach content that everyone else completed two years ago, how many people will realistically be around for you to raid with? MMO's HAVE to continue evolving, or they die. 
---
How many consistent players do you think play games like The Witcher 3, or Skyrim? How many players log on every day to play this game, and simply make a new character when they're done? That's what you're suggesting turning WoW into, just with multiple people walking around in the same world. 
---
I understand where you're coming from, because I'm enjoying Classic as well and I'm not even level 40 yet, but if the game doesn't look to the future, it will flat out die. If the game receives no support, and it costs monthly, what incentive do people have to stay instead of going back to their private servers?
---
YO the game just came out.
---
Maybe I’m slow but you’re being sarcastic right?
---
For me TBC was the peak of WoW
---
This.
---
Every time I approach an area with an escort or named quest I'll ask people if they are on the quest. Either I get a yes and invite them, an invite myself, a no, or silence. And if I get silence, I'm going to just slaughter the mob/grab the escort immediately and ignore you. 
---
A basic level of interaction is required. Even if you gotta tell me your group is full or whatever. I'm not going to risk losing a tag or quest to someone who might not even need it or be waiting for it.
---
Its monster lvl times 5 ... so a lvl 40 mob requires 200 skinning.
---
lmao, brilliant
---
They'll need development in the future. Just not while we're still in phase 1.
---
"Get back to work"!
---
"Wirken en 1.5 sek".
---
So I look at Hunters as a pure DPS class, so as long as one spec was viable they were good because they did damage/had utility like traps and misdirect so they were always wanted. But, I'd understand if you're saying not all their specs were good, we have knowledge now that we could apply to make them a little better. For instance I was a mage, pretty much played Fire the whole time with the exception of tier 5 where we got to play Arcane for a little. But, fire was always "the" spec.
---
Have you tried '/aap skip' ? Or are you level 40? I think it cuts off at 40 right now.
---
Amazing, good work.
---
Ok this is what I thought. Wonder If they will ever allow this to be altered. Thanks.
---
Yeah, I realized my mistake after my coffee
---
I would love it if Classic+ came out, I've read ideas of keeping the level cap but bringing new gear: I'd love if there was more objective to get back to theorycrafting and having incentive for different playstyles as well as different "best-in-slot" for your specific type of play.
---
If they made more options for the people to choose from, we could all be special snowflakes and it wouldn't be so mainstream, everyone would have their purpose, 40man raids would make SENSE because you'd need many many options.
---
OK I want a animated show like this
---
I ran into a 45 Rare elite yesterday and died a horrible death. Some quick calls for arms in /1 and we had a full group running killing him for those green shoulders, it felt pretty satisfying.
---
That means, it's inevitable they will do SOMETHING. Classic+ on the other hand is far from inevitable (though I'm crossing my fingers for it).
---
Grind the humanoids in Arathi. Trolls on the eastern lake, humans/orcs at the farms, ogre cave near stromgarde, and kobolds in Drywhisker Gulch. There is a chest that spawns pretty often in the Drywhisker cave; they also have a chance of dropping banishing charms for the warrior quest, you can AH those for a good bit.
---
Everyone finds Paladin leveling boring.
---
I agree, I would rather it be added as a skill for enhancement shamans or something and they would have to upkeep the buff on some small number of people restricted by buff duration and cooldown (like wc3).
---
You could try TSM it has an auto buy for crafting items I don’t know if it can be used for buying patterns from a vendor though.
---
Well fir me the past 3 evenings i have slain 30 q mobs and spent around 5-6h running around with my warrior buddy chopping up alliance
---
I messed up early with my talents. How can I respec? How much does it cost?
---
Aren't the lines gone now?
---
I’m on Alliance. You?
---
More like can the distance be changed for the health bars but thanks man appreciate it.
---
I thought this was a painting until I read this comment.
---
Just replace all yards with meters
---
EU Daggerspine to Kazzak way back in 2005. Guild Masters and officers posted on forums about migration and like I said people saw it themselves. The server was unplayable and most moved. We actualy got compensated a lot back then because crashes and lag were so frequent Blizzard gave us a few free playing days.l
---
The situation would also be the same in your case if majority decided to move. You would follow for sure but as it stands everybody is affraid of a dead server and because you aren't getting server crashes every day everybody also hopes the queues will just go away and nothing bad will happen.
---
The amount of comments here from people saying they'd just skip the wait and do everything in their power to steal the mob is really disturbing.
---
"WoW classic will have a much better community!"
---
...
---
Hunters have a role to play in certain instances, like in gnomer so they can take down the alarm bots, in Library for all the god damn runners etc. Too many people just don't take advantage of certain classes and the roles they can play that can save a run from turning into a nightmare.
---
Not sure about reckoning but /sit enraging works for warriors but it is tricky. So reck may work as well. Youre gonna have to look into it because I havent learned it yet. Something with sitting then standing up in the same batch or something idk
---
Took 13 runs to get my dungeon farming group a ravager for our enh shaman but toher then that pretty good. Got a corpsemaker on my second run.
---
That didgeridoo didgeridoes it for me.
---
Interesting use case. I'm curious if anyone has their main abilities spread between the two and actively swaps them in combat. Sounds optimal when you think about it but I find it so awkward to play with
---
He has no "tether".
---
2nd monitor is in 60hz. Strangely enough setting the WoW client to run in Windows 7 compatibility mode fixed my problem.
---
Endless phase 1 seasons where people race to 60 and debate about the next season before they experience 90% of the season sounds legit
---
It really depends on what you're using this build for. Is it the build you're working towards for levelling or for use at 60?
---
For levelling it's generally agreed upon that Affliction is king. VW is pretty shit at keeping aggro and working with dots instead of sudden bursts of damage is generally better. Working with improved drain soul also gives you way better long term sustained farming ability. Less time eating and drinking means more time used leveling.
---
For 60 I don't really see what this build is supposed to do. VW isn't used much outside of solo questing.
---
The build also feels like it's spread kinda thin. I'm not a big lock player so I can't say for sure, but it feels like you're not getting the big talents.
---
If you’re smart, you would kill Cookie and likely upgrade your ranged dps BEFORE the final boss. Since he drops the wand...
---
why would they let an already know bug slip trough ?
---
Yeah, you can make Hunters kill their own pets, or vice versa. Very satisfying.
---
Job, apartment and my dog is dead
---
Most UI addons that change the frames (vuhdo, healbot, grid, and unit frame addons like Shadowed Unit frames or Luna Unit Frames) have options you can enable in the addon already to do this. For example in Shadow unit frames theyer is an option to have a green outline that lights up when a player has something I can remove.
---
Fuck no they don't. Took em a month to fix it the first time but now they know the only way to fix it is to add code to check if a pet is infected with CB  or not, every single time a player summons a pet. That bug made the major cities and highly populated zones basically inaccessible.
---
https://youtu.be/3t-OsvFBiXE
---
Yep they got bandages, same as anyone else
---
You know there's an option to save posts, right?
---
Question were you running scarlet monastery
---
I'm having a blast so far with wow classic, but i wouldn't mind having Wow+ expansion (TBC at least) but not right, maybe in the long future.
---
Horde will always have more warlocks I think.  Alliance has to deal with tremor totem and will of the forsaken in PVP which can be frustrating so there is usually a bit less alliance warlocks than horde.  Horde still have to deal with pallies cleansing their spells and such.  Just play the side you like the most! :)
---
Well that's dissapointing actually.
---
It really depends on the warlock, how they lifetap and what their damage-rotation looks like.  
---
If they tap themselves to almost death and then spam shadowbolts it's bad.  
---
If they tap just so much that mana- and health are roughly equal so they benefit from the regeneration of both and then try restoring it themselves with drain-life and such, it's good.  
---
It's a pity for the good locks that the bad locks ruin the reputation of all locks.  
---
I heal them if they think they would die otherwise, regardless of how they got there. This won't happen out of combat and/or if they don't have aggro.
---
Im assuming you mean VC
---
Thank you so much..I will try this today!!
---
I don't think it's objective but they could, and while at it, make them less flashy and outlandish. Getting more simplistic designs is better than having few flashy and overdesigned sets that no one would wear realistically, even in Azeroth.
---
Aww poor warlock mad hes getting beaten by mages and priests for gear?
---
Kalimdor is only worth it starting at lvl 30 with Shimmering Flats and Desolace at 35ish imo.
---
People have issues with AoE because mages flamestrike two seconds into the pull followed by CoC. You can be the best player in the world and it doesn't matter. You can't hold threat vs that.
---
Well that's disappointing but would be interesting if they let it happen for a week event.
---
Get your game on
---
Caverns of time gone wrong.
---
Damn this thread exploded.
---
&gt;why does the lock need to be at max life to start the pull?
---
I thought that was part of the healers job, to heal everyone. But after seeing a few warlocks doing this I came here to see if I did something wrong and turns out I was.
---
A lot of the stuff on your list, I like..
---
*Resist*
---
Agreed. I was doing a quest and there were horde and alliance just jumping around... Horde was just letting the alliance steal their quest objectives while each wasting more of their time jumping around waiting. I was like wtf? Killed the alliance and took over the spot.
---
It'd a different timeline.  I know because I'm a fury warrior instead of arms. Much difference. Many flurry.
---
One of the most valuable boe's in the entire game...
---
they should just use the emperial mesurement system their math is wonky.
---
I advise not farming and just to continue questing or your preferred method of levelling. Money earnt per quest increases as you level up; and there’s no shame in getting mount at later date, that way you can earn xp and gain gold.
---
Dont farm gold for mount. Its a Noobtrap. Just level
---
For Alliance:
---
1-22: Basic Leveling Route (Loch Modan -&gt; Dun Morogh -&gt; Darkshore -&gt; Redridge Mountains -&gt; Duskwood)
---
22-27 Wetlands (Questing &amp; AOE Grinding Gnolls, Murlocs, Raptors, Orcs)
---
27-29 Duskwood (Questing &amp; AOE Grinding Raven Hill Cemetry)
---
29-31 Duskwood (AOE Grinding Nightbane near the cave) 
---
31-33 Hillsbrad Foothills (Aoe Grinding Murlocs until 32 then questing until 33 1/2) 
---
33-37 Arathi Highlands (Hammerfall Peons at the Farm) 
---
37-42 Dustwallow Marsh (Murlocs on the Islands) 
---
42-49 Tanaris (Pirates behind the tunnel) 
---
49-52 Western Plaguelands (Undeads at Sorrow Hill) 
---
52-58 Western Plageulands (Undeads at Daison’s Tears) 
---
58-60 Western Plaguelands (Humans at Hearthglen)
---
I'm waiting for a night when my friends are able to log on again, and trying not to outlevel them in the meantime. It's basically just me stalking around Dun Morogh finding people running basic quests to take their skins. Already maxed out fishing for my level, and can't kill mobs for tailoring without leveling, so I'm selling stacks and stacks of leather.
---
I'm going to be rich.
---
In the world of Azeroth, 1 meter = 1 yard.
---
I've never had an issue with struggling with this.
---
For a start I just throw an occasional renew on them.
---
Second, I often go several pulls in a row without needing to drink.
---
Dont see the issue personally, also that's precisely how it used to be back in the day, this is not new behaviour.
---
I mean... that is kind of what happens when you let bots have free reign over the game. botting was RSC at that point. 
---
That said. started playing Runescape when it was fresh and new, and before members was a thing. I wouldn't go back past the nostalgia phase.
---
I would try healing some of these cleave dungeon runs in SM cath. As a warrior, I love having a paladin healer. They seem to be the best at healing large pulls in this level range. You'll never run out of things to do while in combat.
---
Poor summer child. Thinking 30 is halfway there :D
---
That's always been my opinion. I liked having faster and easier ways to get into dungeons/bgs. At least until I started noticing a trend of increased bad behavior. Name recognition was important in the beginning. Without the risk/reward of that, people devolved into the general base internet troll. Not everyone of course, but enough to make running dungeons become a chore.
---
It’s an alternative hidden AQ set. 3-piece bonus turns me into a human bug zapper.
---
I level with a friend who plays rogue and we do OK. Seal of light + rogue attack speed makes our grinding super sustainable when running an unjudged sea of wisdom. I run pretty deep prot so can handle tanking dungeons to let us skip queuing as 2 DPS. Paladin shines when working with others, solo it sucks with generally sub par damage and tonnes of wasted utility potential.
---
My thing currently is that I want to change my characters name. Only level 25 but still. I ended up getting my retail name later on but there’s no name changes in classic that I know of. I’ve been behind my friends and am just now catching up to some of them, but if I re roll for a name I’ll be behind again. The name I have currently isn’t bad by any means just not the name I originally wanted. Not sure what I should do cause I don’t want to fall even further behind but also I kinda want my name lol. Plus I’ve invested some money into my character plus professions and such so that’d all be lost.
---
I love hunters in 5 mans as long as they understand pet management. They do good damage, aren't as resource constrained as other ranged, and have cc/off tanking ability.
---
I like the Horde because they're metal as fuck.
---
Idk why those folks are so gung ho on sprinting to the finish line. I've leveled 3 separate characters already. One is level 28, another 24, and the third 16.
---
I love taking time to read quests (even though I have Questie add on), grouping with randoms, spending an hour or two just working professions, etc.
---
But to each their own.
---
Yes, and I'm excited about the future.
---
Hey! Found the warrior who left!
---
Because, everyone was talking about ally instead of Horde on this server.
---
Why say things that just aren't true?
---
neon green beard on a gnome
---
you must get all the pussy
---
playing a hunter for the first time, i'm currently lvl 21 and my pet has just learnt growl.
---
i'd like to start doing instances soon, is there a way to stop myself (or my pet) pulling aggro away from the tank like i seem to do all the time with my pet? do i just hope the tank is good enough to maintain the aggro or hold back on some  attacks etc
---
Does anyone know where Mankrik's wife is?
---
go play
---
Guild Wars 1 had a much more interresting approach : you'd only get better looking gear. It was really easy to get the most powerful item possible. Once done, you'd farm for that beautiful set requiring mats from extremely difficult zones, and when you had your FoW armor or your Citadel armor, it felt like one hell of an accomplishment.
---
I would love to see horizontal content simply adding cool-looking gear and optionnal content instead of changing stats. That was enough to keep me on Guild Wars for almost 4 years.
---
One could imagine patches adding epic profession quests, epic class quests that would simply give unique skins to your weapon, quests that would require to do some specific raids as well as solo content comparable to what hunters do with Rohk Delar. Some high level zones that would appear in unused areas such as Azshara, some places in Tanaris, etc.
---
There really isn't any need for more powerful gear. I did BT as a hunter during Cata just to get the bow skin for transmog, and I am not the only one who spent time on useless-but-cool-looking gear. This is the best way to add content.
---
And also, player-driven content is cool : give more tools to organize events. I wish it was possible to have some flags similar to what you have in WSG to organize your own world PvP events with your own rulesets (flag respawn, , timer, etc). I played most Cata content only doing world PvP and events, even though the game way dying.
---
What did the nameplate hotfix do? For someone out of the know?
---
Thanks, I though I had gotten them all. Will have to check tonight
---
Personally I think adding xpacs would ruin the point of it being classic. I guess we start over from square one and play for another decade? When would enough be enough?
---
Because it's a video game and the person on the other end of the screen is in fact a person, and not my 'mortal enemy', and I like to help people out when I can.
---
That’s objectively false.
---
&gt;Oh god another video of someone who thinks their personal experience is interesting...
---
*Benny Hill music starts*
---
&gt;HEEEEE I can't wait to see what happens!!!
---
It’s a revenge fantasy. The concept of ‘punishing’ a teammate is really appealing for a large group of players.
---
‘I acted all passive aggressive and corrected their behaviour, then they sat meekly in the back for the rest of dungeon :)’
---
Then OP says ITT that they’ve left dungeons in the middle over arguments they’re having over the run and things like that. This isn’t healthy behaviour.
---
This is more image editing than cosplay.
---
🤔
---
They are also 9.36% angrier
---
i'd like to cospay Dungeon Master Vishas along side you
---
I didn't recall experiencing my hunter quest tamed pets to stay the size.  All I remember I guess is afterwards when I was taming a bear and being shocked at how much smaller it became.
---
My question then is - do Night Elves tame owls during their hunter quest?  I have never done an Elf before, so I'm used to just the boar/cat/bear taming.
---
You could try the AoE build for a change. I’m sure it has a catchy name but I don’t remember it. 
---
Get yourself a beefy shield, put the best shield spike you can get in it, pull as many as you can handle, consecrate and watch the them kill themselves on your spike.
---
Oh shit now we have to actually play the game without addons that clearly introduce changes and exploits to the original game.
---
Imagine phase 2 "oh shit now we have to actually corpserun instead of /g layer me pls)
---
&gt;WoW’s population grew over time up through the release of ICC.
---
Yes, back when MMORPG was the most popular game genre in the world, and few games could compete to keep the same level of interest. 
---
The rest of your comment is all assumption, granted, so is mine, so we’ll just have to wait and see. Hopefully you can at least see my argument that a diminishing player base plus various live versions of the game will have a negative impact on population. If not, well.... fuck it
---
I think the rules are PvP to pve is legal but pve to PvP is not legal. Cant peovide a source now sorry. But at this point it seems that only fUll/high pop servers are getting free xfers
---
If people didn't have anything better to do then this wouldn't be a problem
---
The only people that are 60 are people who took time off or the unemployed and then of course, children/teens.
---
If you are one of those people that rushed content and now you're sat wondering what the fuck to do, try leveling again but this time, take in the world around you and see the game for what it's meant to be.
---
I approve of your efforts to keep your party alive, but you also don't want to enforce bad behavior. When I tank, if someone accidently pulls or whatever I will attempt to save them, but if someone does it repeatedly then they get to take it.
---
Literally all private servers have died after they released Naxx. All of them.
---
The only reason pservers remained popular is because new realms / servers kept being made that reset the cycle.
---
New content doesn't necessarily fuck up the game. There is plenty of room for horizontal content. Look at OSRS. 
---
Demanding the game to remain static is just unrealistic and is basically equal to demanding them to shut the servers down in 2 years (probably less) time.
---
EQ1 does this crap all the time. Minor changes like XP rates are about it. Otherwise its "new TLP Server up!" and its the exact same grinds over and over.
---
Is that what happened? I noticed that the nameplates stopped popping up unless I was practically standing on top of people.
---
Man, yeah I'd be fine with that change.
---
True but I really don't think it's ever worth chasing after single mobs that a dps is running away from simply because the healer might stand or run into the other enemies while you are out of melee range so suddenly they pull aggro way faster because of the lower threshold in melee range. That's just not worth it, let the dps turn around and take a hit until the tank can taunt or let the dps deal with it completely.
---
Oh I thought you meant that they had a niche both in TBC and Vanilla. Sorry I misunderstood then.
---
Letting someone die to keep heals going on the tank is how you can salvage a bad situation. If you're dps and I'm low on mana I'm not going to heal if I can heal the tank and possibly survive. You'll get rez'd after.
---
You think you do. But you don't.
---
Actually less mages than warriors according to my server census
---
Hey man congrats! It took me like 3 days of camping on that rock to find and tame broken tooth, on kromkrush. It would always scare me when my track beasts would show a a new hunter questing.
---
That's one more hunter than the optimal amount.
---
&gt;None of the content in OSRS is obsolete. All new players needs to work through a massive backlog of hundreds of quests. It's just part of the game.
---
Most of the quests in OSRS are not required to do anything. Maybe 20% of them are required to do relevant content if we're being generous and plenty of content is obsolete. 
---
Making players go through every raid is a terrible idea especially if bosses stick to classic level gear drops of 3-4 pieces and if new raids end up being as hard as current raids, you'll never catch-up unless your buying funnel carries.
---
LMAO.. that's not how this works. that's not how any of this works. i can't wait until they remove layering.
---
IMO Wrath was, when it started to go downwards. With raids no longer requiring pre-quests, having different sizes and difficulties, people started becoming more concerned about the qualification of the others in their raid and the obsession with gearscore started. Also IIRC it was Wrath, when they introduced the dungeon finder. In terms of content wrath was just ok. Ulduar and Icecrown were good, bringing Naxx over was a nice idea, but also kind of lazy and the crusader arena was the biggest disappointment for me and one of the reasons i don't trust Blizzard any more.
---
Yeah, I think it's immersive. It's practice. That's literally how you would practice in the real world (well realistically you'd probably use a target dummy or a sparring partner. The point is to practice on something that can't hurt you. A low-level mob is exactly that).
---
And the lesson teaches you the basics of using the weapon, you're using it at level1 proficiency. Anything more than that? Practice.
---
Classic with no change no resets like it was meant to be.
---
Also for rogues on the second floor in booty bay inn there is a rogue trainer and poisons vendor near scooty.
---
They drop from tailors.
---
&gt; That's the entire point, that's what the community was asking forall these years.
---
Eh...much of the community was simply asking for a return to era 1 of WoW. Rediscovering forgotten things (and things I never discovered the first time around) is a large chunk of that experience. I don't think staleness was ever something most people wanted.
---
Did you change out the spell on your bar?
---
"Bag venders hate him!"
---
I was a sophomore in high school. Now I’m a deadbeat. Thanks horde, you taught me well lol
---
I love it! I play on this server and there was about a 3 hour war against horde and ally for a quest zone on Arathi the other day.  Having only hit 31 it was brutal when the 40s came but it was the most fun I've had in the game in awhile.
---
I also have been wondering this!
---
Yeah I'm on a full server, but the realm they provide is another PvP realm
---
They have definitely hinted that another Diablo is in the making, though it might not be "4" per se.
---
It is something that's for people who like the games though, and developed in house(so not Immortals which likely exists to build the brand in the Chinese market and have something under the umbrella of "Diablo" at the last Blizzcon)
---
Expect some kind of teaser or maaaaaaybe a formal announcement at Blizzcon, I'd expect a 2021 release though. Maybe late 2020.
---
Dude wtf?
---
Heh, I like to afk my cat form druid sleeping on a hammock.
---
But he was the worst hunter, since there were no others 🤔
---
He's saying that if cloth is more expensive than the food you're buying, you're better off *selling the cloth that drops* instead of making bandages with it, and using that money to buy food. That way you make money on the difference.
---
Using the cloth that drops to make bandages means you've essentially "spent" the value of that cloth.
---
See that is the interesting version I am interested in.
---
Since I know Naxx will be the highest Raid there is, I can take my time and enjoy every part Classic has to offer. If I knew that Naxx will be old content in a year than I am pressured to rush towards it just to keep up with all the new content.
---
Holy shit fuck yes lol
---
Mildly agree. Makes the world feel bigger than you.
---
When I was in Stonetalon I saw about 20 allies and 25 horde people.
---
Yeah I don't like arena either because of these reasons as well. 
---
Regarding PvP vs PvE gear, Vanilla did it well enough: PvP gear needs stamina. I like that PvP gear can be useful in PvE and the other way around, but not always the BiS. PvP gear sacrifices too much budget on stamina to be the best in PvE for instance.
---
Ya what a dope
---
Yeah remember when the humans had all the orcs in interment camps. Daddy thrall remembers. 
---
Fuck em
---
It makes kiting a breeze. I'm a mage and I can't imagine using fire blast and cone of cold without it.
---
I had this mindset until hillsbrad lol. If you do that there you'll never get any leveling done haha.
---
Because the alliance wouldnt let the horde (the new horde after gul dan) make a home on the Eastern kingdoms. The horde are the misunderstood, castaway faction. The alliance races didnt accept them. I faction changed becuase i actually read about the lore unlike many others, like i was, chose a faction blindly. The alliance are just a bunch of racists, judging faction. The horde has more to fight for, they are trying to survive in a world that doesnt accept them. They made a home in Kalimdor. When the undead got free from the lich kings control, the alliance tried to slay them all. But the horde braught them in with open arms because they saw themselves in the undead. Controlled, used for evil purposes. Im not touching alliance filth again
---
Both, just not simultaneously. I've never played TBC and only a little WotLK so I'd love to get a real shot at playing them. After that though it would be pretty cool to have Classic+ servers.
---
Yours and Aoki's cosplays are always stunning, really love the attention to details you guys have with every costume!
---
I'm a tailor.
---
As far as I can tell, noone on my server has it. I've never seen the robe on the AH.
---
Now I Need to find out if there is something else on the Gold and Silver Coints :O -t
---
Care to elaborate why alliance and not horde fury warriors?
---
I thought horde is favoured because of windfury totem
---
Before they hotfixed it a couple days ago, demo-shouts AOE threat was actually great. Opening with it would be fine. Not so sure now that they fixed it's threat gen. Now it feels pretty bad.
---
Most people don't mind losing some efficiency if it means getting to "socialize". Because people that do care about efficiency over everything else got to 60 long ago.
---
Still using level 30 robe of frozen wraith at level 58. Still waiting for an end-game dungeon drops/late tailoring switch. In general for AoE you want int if you are short on mana, staming as a safety stat and that's pretty much it. Spell damage in larger quantities is nice but hard to come by.
---
There's also a Moonwell (or multiple) in Moonglade. Dunno if it's closer/faster but prolly involves less walking
---
Downvoted by line waiters. Guys ninja'ing is part of the classic experience, just accept it.
---
Why did it become terrible as more people got flying mounts?  How did their flying mounts affect your gameplay experience? 
---
Flying mounts were a requirement in Outland because of the terrain and size.  In BC, you couldn’t take a flying mount around Azeroth.
---
It's all about the authenticity
---
Nvidia has a function that lets you clip the past x minutes of gameplay which comes default installed on any pre-buult system with a GeForce card. There are plenty of 3rd party software that accomplish the same thing.

Well, it is nice if you think something like that is immersive. I don't, because it is just numbers going up, which is - for me - far away from beeing immersive.
---
Nvidia shadowplay is nice if you've got it - otherwise you'll need a recording software open that's either recording everything, or has the ability to capture the last few minutes of gameplay.
---
I've been running daily Census on my server too and my data closely matches yours.
---
No that these apes don’t manage their threat and with the adjustment to demo shout you might as well dps with your 2h. Jesus are you retarded or just looking to debate the demo shout adjustment. Don’t respond just read.
---
Our guild name is so whack! :/
---
I mean everyone's first sub isn't even up yet for classic and people are saying the theory of people leaving has been debunked. I think that's crazy. Renewing the sub for the first time I think is probably the *first* milestone.
---
From the min/max side of things 
---
The pve combat swords spec is absolute dog shit awful in PvP. Truly bad. But it’s miles ahead of anything else for PvE raiding. 
---
If you’re not in a hardcore raiding guild - you can run just about any spec in raiding and be okay. 
---
In 1.12 rogues are much weaker than earlier versions of vanilla both due to direct changes and indirect changes the game made from its initial release stand point. 
---
For world PvP you can run the 21/8/22 CB /Prep dagger build and basically 1v1 anyone as long as your cds are up. If your cds are down you’re basically hot garbage though and you lose most extended fights. 
---
Hemo swords is usually my go to PvP spec. This spec is great for people who are under geared or are sitting in mostly pve gear.  Lots of control and you can lean heavily on eviscerates relatively fixed damage. 
---
So to answer your question - from a min max perspective you need to pay respec fees.  Anything outside of that and you can just raid in your PvP spec for the most part.
---
Yea.. That'd be an instant-nope from me. How shortsighted.
---
Bandages &gt; food every single time. When I turned 25 I bought 10 cheese or whatever it was and I still have 4 at 34. Bandages are faster and the faster you go the more money you make per hour. IMO you shouldnt be selling your cloth to buy food.
---
Whatever Blizzard decides, I hope that it is based on polls. It's time to let the community drive the game's future. It worked for OSRS/Jagex, why wouldn't it work here as well?
---
Definitely not "True Classic": I would quit the day they told me my character/server would be reset in X months.
---
It's hard to decide between "Classic+" and "Classic Expansions". I definitely want to relive the good parts of TBC and WotLK, but I don't want the bad parts that came with them. If we were going to have "Classic Expansions", they would have to be reworked.
---
That's why I think the "Classic+" is the best option, but shouldn't exclude adding *some* content from TBC/WotLK. We could have a game that will **never** go beyond level 60 (70 at most). TBC content with reworked flying mounts (or maybe no flying whatsoever) in Outland; no changes to the key aspects that make Classic good. Then, after that, add some WotLK content, following the same principles from the TBC content 
---
IMHO "Classic+" is the best option, but **new content must be based on polls**. Whatever that Blizzard does, if they do it without hearing the community (and I'm not talking listening to the forums, I'm talking about literally adding in-game polling booths), the same downfall will happen again.
---
How do i set up my demons to start attacking as soon as i start casting a spell at a mob. 
---
Right now they either attack everything on sight(aggressive) or they dont do shit till i get hit(defensive).
---
So true.
---
What are people doing to make money? I'm 36 and sitting at 48g but i feel like it's been mostly through vendor trash and not a ton of my own ability to make money. For reference, i'm a rogue herb/alch sitting around 215/215 and have cooking at 225, no fishing, max first aid if that helps. 
---
Really want to get my mount in a few levels but i'm only a little over halfway there with a few levels to go. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!
---
It's on the XP bar, you can toggle it from XP to minimap.
---
I also like how she went for the original Whitemane version and not the anime waifu from HotS.
---
I will add that your heals are a lot more efficient for mana than ours our. If you ever see a lock at 50% hp and 80% mana, a heal can still help the group move faster in the long run.  
---
But yea, most decent locks manage their HP well and are fine not being at 100%. We learned a long time ago that if we are at 100% mana and 100% life while questing, we are probably being inefficient.  
---
I would suggest that you throw a HoT on them between fights and if they seem to be crutching on it or you don't have a mage to give free water, just mention "Hey, I'm low on water. I need you to drink between fights with the group as I don't have the mana to sustain us both."  
---
There are some bad apples, but most warlocks are cool with being lower life. If they are sitting at 10% life while the rest of the group is stopped, then you have a problem lol.
---
Probably
---
Also guys, quick question about frostbolt:
---
When firing a frostbolt, you apply a default 40% slowness to the target. If you fire a cone of cold, it applies a 50%. Now, the 50% will replace the 40%, I have seen it. However, the opposite does not. And even after the effect of cone of frost, the effect of frostbolt, does not replace it. Is it intended?
---
What happened in this thread?
---
As a druid main, your welcome! we will always send heals and buffs to needed allies!
---
Gratz. I did also ding 40 yesterday :)
---
Loot has been ok. I play on weird hours so I’m mostly doing questing and not so many instances. One blue world drop that will finance parts of my lvl40 mount.
---
The way recipies for leatherworking (and all professions in general) is that you will get some recipies by training, some you can buy from vendors either in cities or out in the world, or as loot out in the world.
---
Same applies to breaking a CC'd mob.  "You break it you tank it."
---
Looking at you, shadow priest.
---
I'm not a fan of razer either (the buttons look like they're about to break imo) but they're clearly quite popular so there's gotta be people using lots of mouse binds.
---
Amazing! proud of you. Former warrior now mage.

Ya blew it.
---
Low level characters barely give any "honor" if I remember correctly. Farming them wasn't worthwhile at all.
---
I'm more impressed with the set location than the outfit. Where is that?
---
Why don't you dungeon with the friends you make along the way?
---
You are making friends, right? In a community-driven game? Right??
---
yeah, dude's clearly just an asshole. I am taking furor a bit later, but it really comes down to personal preference.
---
Cant wait to try this hahahahahahaha
---
They don't have a taunt.  And I've never seen any good evidence that their threat generation is anything special to make up for that.
---
The other issue I'd see is that they don't have warriors ability to push crush and crit off the table with shield block.  While also lacking the giant damage sponge capacity of a bear.  I'd fully expect them to gib just like a warrior who missed his shield block.
---
Dungeons are easy enough that I don't see why a paladin couldn't tank them, it would just be rough.
---
“Game breaking”  
---
I don’t think so Tim.
---
I would argue that what has hurt the game in recent years has been a lot of catering to the bottom 10% as well.
---
This 100%.
---
This is a Vanilla cosplay and definitely belongs here. Downvote and move on if you don't like it. Thats what the system is designed for. If enough people don't like it, then it won't show up. Let the majority decide. I hate when one person tries to outweigh the opinions of the majority.
---
back to not being able to see shit or see a casters health bar from 4 yards away.
---
whewww
---
Its also my highest liked comment...the effort/reward ratio is quite deep for this one. 😉
---
There's a setting in the Interface menu, I believe under the social tab, that lets you turn them off. It should be a drop down menu. I hate chat bubbles, too.
---
u/srgrafo you classic bro?
---
I cannot believe, how hypocritical your comment was.
---
In the nicest way possible:
---
This video is **sarcasm** it's playing on the joke of him as a character, it was only made to show a spark of creativity in a dull-ish area, something classic wow is very good at, he has stuck in, and your, head for weeks in either distaste, or hilarity, the fact his name is even recognizable from a random post on Reddit to you proves my claims.
---
His story, albeit real/fake is irrelevant, he's doing a schtick, and it's hilarious to witness.
---
And even if it was "for the reactions" you're only helping his cause infinitely more than mine by getting upset at all over this. 
---
Don't **YOU** be a part of this terrible meme.
---
Forcing kings as a ret talent doesn’t make ret good, it just means one of your healers will spec ret for it and still heal.
---
I think I liked Wrath a little better. The raiding was amazing (Ulduar is still my favorite raid and ICC is top 5, IMO. Getting to actually do Naxx was really exciting for the majority of the playerbase since so few people actually got to do it in vanilla.) While I absolutely loved BC, the leveling in that expansion felt horrible, and the dependence on the dungeon sets to be able to viably raid or even do Khara was frustrating (it took me forever to get my set so I spent like 2 months doing the same dungeons over and over again for nothing other than a small shot at a set-piece from the final boss.) 
---
Maybe I just got lucky in Wrath and my RNG was horrible in BC, but I recall the gearing in Wrath feeling a lot more linear and smooth, and the leveling grind was much more enjoyable to me.
---
Not sure if they have the same boss - but even though I have surpassed others in my career, I still refer to people as “boss” when talking about them in past tense. But if they do, then kudos to them for staying with a company that long :)
---
As long as they do TBC and WotLK I don't really care what else they want to add to Vanilla.
---
SOCIETY HAS MADE A NET GAIN.
---
There's something so cool about chasing somebody while in Ghost Wolf, feels like i'm actually chasing prey haha
---
I don't think you have enough evidence to make any hard conclusions, we are in uncharted territory here.
---
I think there is a loud vocal minority that are really pushing for more content, but then what happens after that? more content? then after that? Where does it end? If you change the original game then it is no longer the original game.
---
What happens after Classic? You play The Burning Crusade. The other option, in addition to TBC, is to create season realms that start from zero and go through all the content again.
---
People want what happened to RuneScape to also happen to Classic. Give it 2-3 years and maybe Blizz can add some COMMUNITY APPROVED content to the game. Calling the game perfect as is is nothing short of ignorant.
---
This is what it was like in vanilla. You guys asked for it, don’t complain now.
---
Hahaha!! This was actually in the middle of an urban park in a medium sized city. I rode a bike to this adventure. 
---
I mean the optics of it certainly give off that vibe but it’s almost sad how far from accurate it is. I’m such a millennial urbanite...my dog wears a sweater around the house.
---
I played for a month in 2005 when I was 15. I got to level 20. I'm currently level 25. I've never been to red ridge never been To duskwood. Never been to elwynn forest or Westfall. Never done a dungeon. This was my progression so far.
---
 So deadmines was my first and I'm having my first experience with everything. Something many of you are trying to have.  I think the worst part is everyone is so knowledgable when it comes to this game I still don't understand some of the messages in chat cause it's in wow talk lol, so there's a but if magic missing there since I'm learning while most seem to have such a deep knowledge of the game.  If I get to 60 and it's all fun I'm going to try retail. I did watch Tim on Twitch for maybe an hour here or there over the course of a few months when he played cause it did always interest me but I'm turned off cause of the elitist who play. 
---
 But I owned and sold a business, had a kid. Met my wife. Picked up golfing and poker as additional hobby.

Tbh I would not worry about gear as a mage, I still got lvl 29-34 greens at lvl 56 with no issues in pvp or aoe

9.36% increase over zero is still zero.
---
As a tank, I've never skipped him ever.  I didn't know other groups skipped.
---
Yeah judging from my Deadmines runs, the instincts seem to either be to keep attacking it and hope it dies first or run as far away from the tank as possible and hope the mob...gives up? It was bad. I've seen less of it now in higher dungeons.
---
dreamweave vest is good and cheap to craft.  i'd sell the robes of insight, not worth equipping.

I don't get anything above its head when it's too far away. Am I supposed to? All I get is the target thing in the corner like my own healthbar.

yep i changed some smale things, but didnt delete is brand in the bottom
---
My favorite so far (besides mage pulling with AOE), is me trying to LoS targets and having two rogues in the group that are stealthed up near the mob. as soon as i start pulling them back, they gank the mob, pull the others, and i cant even make it back to the fight before they're almost dead, then work like crazy to try and pull threat.
---
I only have a 2 characters below 10 and one level 20. Tonight after finishing a quest where I need like 60 horns for, I'm going to level up fishing. If friends get on that are behind me, I'll help them quest. I don't have to worry about leveling my main two professions because they're skinning and leatherworking.

So whos on top?  Whats the background???

As a priest I thought 33 was too low for SM? RFK is way too easy now would like to do SM.

Yeah and what’s he chatting about. You can just bubble heal.
---
I only want one thing. Pally taunt lol
---
I truly am as chilled as it gets. I like how you don't get the fact that I attack 1 vs 2 or 3 on purpose, because I want a tougher challenge. This really shows the alliance mindset and the fact that you still didn't get the point :)
---
I played D2 a lot and still never got 1.  I mean, I played a lot as a kid.  Had a lot of hard to get things, but never an SoJ.
---
Not even close.  They just abandoned the western ideals of what makes an MMO great, in favor for catering to a playasia ideology of grinding and layers of RNG to appeal to a more profitable market.  The game itself is still great, for what it is.  From a business standpoint, it was a brilliant move to re-release the classic version for the same price as the retail version and appeal to two markets, rather than trying to compromise by changing retail back.
---
I'm 34, Hemo spec. PvE just fine. I play mostly solo though.
---
Practice by doing some world PVP. When BG's come out, practice healing there as well.
---
We had google videos and mechanics were on forums, everyone had to read up on them and the raid leader would also explain. But back then people played to have fun, didn't really care about things like BiS, and now people seem to think that minmaxing is the game.
---
Did exactly this
---
WoW was the greatest zero to hero story in an mmo.  It’s generally what a novel would have been if the reader were the main character.
---
wouldn't you need completely different stats though?
---
legit pissed you were downvoted for this, the talent TREE has so much potential but was restricted to 1% of it due to the damn cost. 
---
removing the cost should have been the logical next step before blizzard removed them..
---
Give a way for a bunch of players to measure their e-penises and everyone suddenly has a mile long dick from the group requirements, and only you are between 5-8 inches.
---
Yeah I gotcha man it's all good 👌
---
YOU THINK YOU DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
taunt + 2x sunders. Fixed.
---
I love having most classes in my group, until they do the bad thing their class does. :P
---
But seriously, each class brings something unique to a dungeon. It makes the good ones stand out as unique and makes the bad ones have their own variety of fuck up.
---
Lol, yeah that would be a good idea- a lot of redditors are advocating an approach similar to osrs. I wonder though that a lot of things, a significant portion will oppose it’ll be difficult to get a 75% plus
---
But... I made it only this year in May 😅
---
Anybody here can help a warlock out and get some attention to an important bug that affects a lot of different aspects of the game.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/improved-imp-fire-shield/296836/5
---
Improved Imp doesn't actually apply any modifiers to spells the imp has. No 30% extra damage to firebolt, no 30% more stam to blood pact, no extra damage from fire shield, which means less threat for the tank. It's a pretty significant bug that isn't getting a lot of attention because I don't think a lot of people use improved imp.
---
&gt;Does the barehanded skill ever matter?
---
The most common application of bare-handed combat will be when you are disarmed and in melee range. This can occur in PvP and PvE. 
---
A less common application would be when you are competing for mob tags. But I believe for a hunter firetrap trumps all in terms of instant-tagging. 
---
And then the least common application would be for the achievement "Knuckle-Sandwich" when they add the burning crusade expansion. (kidding) 
---
Honestly unless you are on a high combat PvP server and you need that fraction of extra damage in combat, it's not something you need to worry about. You can always level that stuff later.
---
Arent there already specs that can pretty much one shot/auto-win in T3 gear, even if the other person isnt severely underpowered?
---
Power creep is absolutely a huge issue that was already a problem in Vanilla.  Without adding baseline resil or something idk how they can make it work.
---
Even if you ignore the PvP part, you still have the problem of people being able to farm elites with nice drops and stuff with no risk/danger, or being able to quickly AoE farm high level dungeons, etc.
---
Theres a lot of problems that power creep brings up, and i have no idea how they could make it work without breaking the game.
---
They aren't 1-1 examples man.  I was just using them to express my point, don't take everything so literally.  Also, why are you offended by my reply and if u don't have anything to add that is on topic then move along.  We are done here.
---
Do some rfk/ sm gy/lib . Grind some monsters and continue questing later.
---
I remember someone else do that. Last time I checked Germans aren‘t KOS
---
&gt; None of the content in OSRS is obsolete.
---
Except for like 3/4s of all mini games, a good half of all quests, several huge swaths of the map, and more than a few skills above level 70 or so 
---
OSRS is actually pretty bad about making content obsolete. Ironman mode is a good solution for that, but for regular characters... yeah you can and should skip many parts of the game
---
Nope, first daily quests where 2.1.  Light's Hope Chapel were repeatable quests.
---
Dude fuck that area. I ended up in a group of 4 and we were trying to do those fuckin harpies and fire elementals and after like an hour of us getting wrecked because mobs would just keep respawning in groups so you're fighting like 6 at a time we all just said "you know what? Fuck this" and went our separate ways.
---
This is wrong - first respec is 1g as others have mentioned. IIRC it was a 5g decrease to the cost per month back in vanilla, not 10g/week. I believe each new respec will cost 5g more than the last. Unsure what the cap is.

Master elemental shaper krixix.
---
Why did you not take this picture with your phone? Are some sort of hethan?
---
When I did that with a group it was a complete shit show.  Groups were just wiping each other and trying to tag the boss.  Group before us did it to us.  Then we did it to the group behind us.  We were so low, there was no way 5 of us could do it alone.  So each group just used the other one to help without consent and it always killed the second group.
---
Or just play a caster so your damage all scales with level...

it's fucking SM lmao, who cares how much dps you do as long as you clear it.
---
i am still leveling but i think it is intresting t consider a classic+ and what changes you would like to see that would still be inline with classic. but we are talking about somthing 2 years away.
---
but due to use knowing what classic hold in place in the future the only thing to talk about is what after classic? the only thing that could be changed and still be inline with #nochanges is to have C'thun pre-nerf and see if secound time around we can beat him.
---
hmmm you have a strange thought process. i would have thought that blizzard explaining what theyre plans are for teh future of the game would be reassuring rather than off putting
---
&gt;Many players feel the same and that’s why private servers worked well without any new content for years: the game is perfect the way it is now.
---
This is false.  Private servers go until people start taking their nax BOE farms into BGs.  Then fall apart for a fresh start.  For some reason having perfect stats makes for a less than fun environment for PVP encounters.  Queue resilience...
---
Im stupid with you, bro.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
This isn't really much of a question, but it definitely doesn't warrant it's own post:
---
*These new Paladins, huh?* I tried to group up to do the Elite dwarf quests in Wetlands. 28 Warrior, 28 Mage, maybe a 27 rogue...and someone's guildie joins: a 35 paladin with Herod Shoulders and the Axe (grats).
---
The Paladin proceeds to believe that because he's 7 levels above these elites, he can pull 3 at a time. He also doesn't understand positioning - so while we're chopping away at these packs of dwarves, here come another 3 pack of them.  We wipe. Twice. Normally I find a nicer way to abandon this failure of a group, but I just /leave party without a word and continue questing.
---
Well the very next night, I need to do "Defeat Nek'roth" (sp?) - he's a 29 elite surrounded by packs of 29 mobs - definitely not soloable at lvl 29. We group up: 27 Druid, 29 Warr, 28 rogue...and a 31 ret paladin who asked to join. This is a different paladin, surely I'll have different results, right?
---
HAH. We get to the area, which is essentially a cul-de-sac in the mountains where all of the mobs are grouped up. I, the warrior, start scouting which mobs can be pulled without aggroing the others. I mark one with a skull and begin to shoot...when the ret paladin charges into the pack of 5 (including the elite), consecrates, and proceeds to super-tank everything.  Death.
---
Alright, fine. I'm not going to be silent two days in a row. I explain to the paladin that you have to pull them back. We get back to the spot. I shoot the melee mob, then move far back to pull the casters away from the group. Success. 
---
Now there's only two mobs left: a melee mob and the elite. We have a rogue. I ask the rogue to sap the melee mob and the four of us will make quick work of the elite. Rogue saps. 3 of us charge the elite...and the ret paladin, for whatever reason, goes after the sapped mob and solos him. TF? Thankfully, 3 vs 1 elite was successful, but wow.
---
Sigh...I just needed to tell somebody this story. It's wild. I'm guessing they are retail players who don't know their limits, but man it has been frustrating.
---
Please stop telling other people what to do.
---
They didn't when we went to the moon. Haven't you noticed we haven't been back since NASA turned traitor?
---
The group has to start somewhere. Having a healer or tank right away shouldn't be a requirement for starting a group.
---
honestly I agree with /u/panuhwow  
---
There's an ignore feature, you were the only one complaining. If he had that much of an impact on you I don't random groups are for  you.
---
Yards are longer than meters. You be trollin hard ;)
---
Well perhaps there is another solution instead of cramming everyone back into instances and ruining the game for a second time round then.
---
Everyone is playing classic because the social aspect is in full swing and world PVP very much is a part of that.
---
I just dont get the logic of joining a PVP server then complaining when it happens.
---
Ya I'm not entirely sure but I hadn't been able to train my pet for 4 levels. The list said 'xx ability - 5 points'
---
and i couldn't train it even though i had 57 training points. The skill said 'requires level 8'
---
Again, i'm not completely familiar with the training pets process and couldn't find anything to tell me that it wasn't a bug.
---
He's going to be on so many people's lists now!

You might be taking the Internet a little too seriously today my guy

My friend was having the same problem in mara yesterday while kiting princess, seems very buggy atm.

What if they both realized that spending money and earned resource on material reward was a shortsighted viewpoint aimed at shallowly marginalizing a pithy point?
---
There’s a million guides for this I’m sure, but I’m trying to start saving mount gold. I’m at 31 with 18g. I’m a tailor and herbs, thinking of dropping herb and pick up skinning. With regular questing, dungeons, not learning spells besides the staples and moderate amount of gathering/selling bags will I make enough in 9 levels to afford it? Or will I need to grind at some point?
---
Still used Feet and inches for the moon landings.
---
Yep I understand, I can't help but feel you're ignoring my main suggestion to justify Classic+.  
---
I've already said this in another comment but; ok you create more content, then what happens after that? more content? then after that? Where does it end? If you change the original game then it is no longer the original game. I personally do not want Bliazzard to change the base game and if their technical explanations of how Classic works are correct I'd assume they wouldn't want to either. Adding more content will be expanding on the 1.12 data and in their own words, 'it would be like opening Pandora's box'.
---
What happens after Classic? You play The Burning Crusade. The other option, in addition to TBC, is to create seasonal realms that start from zero and go through all the content again.
---
My only real issue is that the mods work for Blizzard.  It sucks if you genuinely post something critical about the game.  Your post gets removed.
---
Shameful shameful stuff.  I doubt thats what the spirit of Reddit was intended for.
---
That's not naxx  water
---
I would be upset too. But I wouldn't have complained.
---
I believe WoW Classic was meant to be played at a slower pace. I don't see Blizzard rushing to the burning crusade any sooner.
---
There are some steps to be implemented, and as far as I'm concerned, Naxxramas will be the last thing to be released in WoW Classic.
---
So chill out and enjoy the journey(s). (In case you have alts)
---
I’d like to see them make shaman tanking a thing too. It was apparently in the original plans, but then they took it out, but left a few residual things.
---
"Oh, buff got removed when the other mage buffed you aswell? He must be higher level i guess"
---
And sometimes they stick around to help you on your turn!
---
Compared to Stonetalon Mountains, Ashenvale is great.

It is but it's no where near the same as it used to be, voting on content sounds good on paper but you have to bare in mind that everybody gets a vote regardless of what they enjoy in the game or whether they will vote in good faith/be bias, for example pvp in rs (something that was previously looked upon fondly) has openly gotten the shaft due to the player shift caused by ironman mode being added to the game which outright opposes anything pvp related by design.
---
Also the efficiency mentality completely took over osrs a few years into the game as well as the addition of some questionable if not outright broken items being added to the game. It's still a great game but it's absolutely not "old school" anymore. The people playing osrs still aren't the same people who wanted it back, for the most part.
---
Oh dude, I loved Ulduar it actually is still my favorite raid in World of Warcraft. Absolutely beautifully designed and epic feeling. The Algalon fight and hallways (Celestial Planetarium) leading up to it are literally cemented in my brain forever. I think why I'm so stuck on BC is because it was my first experience with World of Warcraft and the Outlands and exploring all the zones to a new player truly felt incredible. It's going to be different for everyone for sure, and I agree I wouldn't touch anything past Wrath.
---
These builds are mostly fine in dungeons.  full dagger builds can be annoying during solo play though, due to the positional restrictions.
---
I'm sure plenty of people will have crazy gatekeeping restrictions where they only want min/maxers with the best theorycrafted spec and full pre-raid BIS, and to some degree you won't be able to avoid that.
---
As much as possible is pretty low a lot of time while leveling.  Rage generation isn't exactly high unless you're getting chunked.

Some people want classic because they want a sense of community to be brought back. No sharding, no cross-server, no LFR, no LFD - they want to talk to people, participate in a collapsed economy, establish friendships and rivalries... basically return to the feeling of what MMOs used to be. That community won't last if there's a known expiration date. People are worried about Classic+ because they don't want to think that the communities they're building and participating in are doomed to an inevitable death. 
---
Look at how many pepe and tendie posts you see in this sub. There are a lot of folk who are kind of deplorable to be honest, who want to find some sort of social connection to hang onto that they can't find in real life and can't find elsewhere online, and they don't want to think that even this little bit of connection is getting to taken from them once Classic loses its luster.
---
Sure. And I might consider going back for WotLK but I just think it’s going to be too grindy for most ppl.
---
Soon I will be a man of winter.
---
No man can serve two masters
---
&gt;We need a game where it's okay for people to just clear content and then quit and wait for more content too. 
---
You're right, I completely agree. At this point in time however, that seems more likely to me and I fear that the folks who just want vanilla forever are going to be relegated back to pserver hopping. Time will tell I suppose. 
---
&gt; The irony on retail is that despite the MONTHLY subscription Blizzard seems to do a lot of things to encourage DAILY play. Even having people unsubscribe and subscribe again later shouldn't be the end of the world.
---
My God do I hate "dailies". I hope nothing of that form ever makes it's way to either classic or classic+.
---
If a game isn't good enough to encourage your players to log in to it daily without having to bribe them to do so then idk what to tell you. You goofed haha.
---
I'm still outdpsing most of the time.
---
But yeh you defend crappy mages.
---
Watched a ally mage 8 levels higher try and gank a horde. We swiftly killed him. Such a weak class.
---
I think retail/classic coexisting for now is a great A/B test to see what works and what doesn’t. You don’t get much better opportunities than this. Ideally Blizzard or some other company will put these lessons to use for a nextgen MMORPG.
---
That yeti cave north of south shore is like a skinning cave of wonders.
---
I am so glad this doesn't happen on my realm at all. People just pick w/e wants to run the dungeon with them.
---
True, walls don't work in BC and onwards, damn flying mounts. Let's invest in magic barriers instead, they tend to work better! Just look at Dalaran.
---
Probably freaked once you said you wanted to breathe on them.
---
tauren for that fat +5% hp. personal opinion.
---
other people say troll for berserking or orc for axe skill
---
Yeah, i dont blame you for being picky when choosing groups. You're bound to spend an hour or more in some instances. It's best to make your own group.
---
Plus it's nice to diversify the classes in your run. I like seeing representation of all the classes.
---
Fatherland servers when?
---
At some point, you should just be using the realm forums, no?
---
Gnomer is a massive dungeon that isn't always cleared all the way through. It depends on why you're going to the dugeon. However, the last boss of gnomer is level 36. Most addons will tell you the level range of Gnomer is 29-36. Personally, I won't go until I'm level 34 just for a matter of comfort.
---
So this is how the Classic Trilogy dies...with thunderous applause. Here's to hoping the Classic + people are the vocal minority and get crushed in any Blizzard polls.
---
That's your argument? Alright.
---
Started in early BC, but the point stands. 
---
In 2004 it was becoming clear that my "mood swings" were not normal and that there was something seriously wrong with me. There was no end in sight as my parents were in denial and I wouldn't get psychiatric help until several years later, and years after that until I found a medication that worked due to an insane amount of genetic resistances to psychiatric meds. I was angry, dissociative, and terrified. By the time I was playing WoW in 2007, it was a foregone conclusion that I would never make it to 30. 
---
Nothing stayed the same. I'm 30 this winter. I'll never be "normal" because the meds can only do so much, but I'm happy. I'm engaged to an amazing human and have a dumb dog that I love. When I log into WoW now it's because I'm ready to enjoy Azeroth, not because I'm desperately trying to escape reality. I'll always be severely disabled and have a lot of roadblocks as a result, but I'm actually excited to continue living. 
---
 TL;DR: It got better.
---
Actually very beneficial as a rouge to wait a bit. I’ve got pockets to steal from.
---
Being in an instance group is a good reason though.
---
Try and get a frostweave tunic, it has +10 int and frost damage
---
If Blizzard does classic+ I want them to change the meeting stones... instead of summoning people to the stones, just make them work as the place to meet people who want to run the dungeon that dont already have a group.
---

Future discussions are fun but have too much uncertainty at the moment. There is not enough data to choose any of the options although the classic team will likely have a plan post roll out of vanilla content. They'll adapt it once they get more data. 
---
As long as we are not worrying anxious about the games future, these discussions can be fun.
---
As a hunter, if you end up in melee, something very wrong has happened. You  should primarily be using your gun as your main source of dps. 
---
I wouldn't focus on leveling my melee weapons or barehanded skills, just let it happen as it happens. You should be doing 99% of your dps with your gun/bow.
---
Exactly.  Its part of the games success.  I was a massive fan of BGs, but world PVP is even more fun.
---
Anything with int/stam for aoe. While you're leveling the stats are better than +dmg for aoe farming imo
---
As a warlock, and drain tank specced for leveling, we are designed to be able to heal to full with basically 1-2 drains from \~50% health. If you throw a renew on us, it's cool, if not, we understand. I generally tell healers so long as you dont see a mob hitting my face, you're cool to leave me at 30-50% health.  
---
that being said, please dont blame us when the 41 warrior cant hit the 46 mobs in uldaman ultimately leading to 4 mobs running at your face and us dotting them in an attempt to get them off you. i did ss you after all
---
I made friends with a tailor early on, solved my problem right quick!
---
This. I hate this AoE meta. Every tank for ZF insists on using Ravager and mobs just bounce from dps to dps. I the go oom and have to drink every other 3-pack, but I never get the time to fully drink, so I just end up chugging water. I'm not sure how it is faster in any way.
---
the british mage does get conjure tea though giving them a great mana recovery buff
---
Is it better ZYGOR guide or VANILLA QUESTING guide?
---
Nice clickbait
---
Kind of like how the majority wanted flying.  The majority of the people who wanted flying, also wanted looking for group.  And so on.
---
Basing good/bad solely on mob rule is a really awful way to do things.
---
Are low quality memes and cosplay threads considered fun to read by most people?  It's probably safe to assume yes.  The problem is that the inevitable end result is that you end up with nothing but memes and cosplay threads.  Meaningful discussion, if it exists, is hidden behind all of the fluff.
---
It would be better to start a wowclassicmemes subreddit, instead of turning wowclassic into nothing but memes.

How would the reset option work? An expansion's life cycle is roughly 2 years. So you'd reset after 2 years? Also, what would happen if someone started playing while we were on the Naxx or AQ40 patch? There would be so little incentive because you know the day where you get your character wiped is on the horizon. I feel like this idea doesn't work for this game at all.
---
Most cosplay images are
---
You're already 31 - picking up skinning now, imo would be a waste of time since you have to skill trough the low level mobs to get to your desired skill and you Keep on questing. I really think you will have enough money by 40 (I made around 20 g from 35-36 yesterday currently sitting at 50g without skinning and I am possitive that it's enough.
---
&gt;Is there any way to write a Rogue pickpocket macro that will allow me to pick pocket a mob and have it auto loot, while I have auto loot turned off for global looting?
---
Seems like the features offered in the game have solved this problem in the opposite way you are asking. With auto-loot enabled, you can shift click a mob to not auto-loot it. Just wanted to make sure you were aware while you wait for an answer from someone.
---
This ^
---
Seriously I hit 40, and had barely touched STV and have not done anything in Arathi but run through it. Maybe I've had below average drop rates, but I have had more quests to do than I know what to do with, but that does tend to slow down in later levels if I recall correctly.
---
There may be an easier way but how about AutoHotKey to translate keystrokes.
---
Lol you've blocked that many people already? Poor poor sensative snowflake :(
---
I went BS on my warrior and have him really well geared from that and I have no problems so far, even the occasional 3-mob fight.
---
This is easy to fix!

They only need to keep a note sticky on their monitors, that says: 
---
*"Do the exact opposite of what the community wants. Except giving this note to them."*
---
"What about removing DKs?"
---
"Okay two changes"
---
Tanks set the pace of the dungeon and to be frank, some of them are just too damn slow. So I (warlock) will sometimes take it upon myself to pull the next group to the tank or pull the lone patrolling mob and drain tank it myself.
---
PSA to tanks.  Your group doesn't need 100% hp/mp before every pull.  If you are lollygagging around after EVERY PULL you can expect your group to get frustrated and start pulling for you.
---
If it doesnt have to be same class, Titans grip on enhancement would be something.
---
I'm a shaman and I dont know what he just did to beat that dude lol.. can someone explain
---
Ashenvale, Stonetalon
---
3 out of 6 people I level'd with are already bored of the lvl 60 life and are back to pushing M+.
---
I'll likely follow soon if phase 2 don't launch soon ( as in, 2-3 weeks tops).
---
doubt it.
---
I would only really be ok with arenas if they weren't rated and treated more like BGs. Players should be able to queue up solo and get matched with a partner or partners and it's just for fun and an honor grind. Otherwise things get way too tryhard way too fast, people start only inviting to bg premades based on your arena rating, only a select few classes/builds are considered viable and good luck getting an invite to an arena if you're not playing them, etc. Seasonal rewards are also not really in the spirit of classic, and I would prefer if the arenas were just another way to get the same rewards you would otherwise get from BGs.
---
Maybe it actually *does* have increased range, so they scaled the damage by the same percent?  
---
20 - (20 * .09) = 18.2     
---
22 - (22 * .09) = 20.2    
---
  ?
---
Oh haha. My name is Zyzzbrah. Me and my friends were focusing you cause you were like 10 lvls over us. Great battle indeed!
---
The ones that roll with spell power are actually pre-BiS for casters...
---
no, it doesn't.
---
Is combat daggers still strong in PVE if you get the MC Daggers?  I seem to recall it being quite busted.
---
Cool, so, 1 person
---
i actually don't see a whole lot of warlocks
---
Does Rogue sap always break stealth? I only played rogue in retail, so I don't remember how they worked back in the bad old days.
---
Groups keep asking me to sap (and of course I oblige) but I always end up pulling the rest of the group immediately after.
---
DE is the ISO code for the German (Germany) language. So, Denglish is funny.
---
Don't you think they have a divided player base now? Some prefer the new game and some the old.
---
Where’s the setting to show their face when something like this happens? The face doesn’t change for me.
---
Some walls are not actually physically walls so unfortunately you'll pull through them, and ships are weird like that for walls like that. Similar to how hiding behind certain structures doesn't break LoS for spells, it will just go straight through.
---
It's more that I don't think Blizz should have hard plans for the game at this point. How could they have the data to make definite statements about the game right now? 
---
They need to stay flexible and have a dynamic strategy going forward. Making statements now and retracting them later will just confuse people and hurt their credibility. 
---
They've done a great job so far and can easily ride this for a long time while they get the data needed to make the best path forward.
---
The best thing you can do to manage threat is give the tank a 5 second head start before you start to attack. As a hunter, you have access to feign death, which will (somewhat reliably) reset your aggro tables, which is helpful if you accidentally pull aggro off the tank.
---
Other than that, there are addons that can help you manage it, but they dont work very well at the moment.
---
Hi, I’m Mr. Booby Buyer, and I’ll pay you 15 shmeckles for your boobies.
---
classic just came out and you're already talking about changing it lmao
---
Mods you're not done here...
---
But orcs and tauren are fighting the humans and dwarves together. Realistically the Alliance would have given up on trying to be warriors a long time ago or die swift deaths.
---
Have you ever heard of the EverQuest private server, Project 1999? That's been around for years without any content changes.
---
Haha I see. That is funny.
---
I'd like to see a fusion of True Classic and Classic+.
---
Like PoE style leagues but with an obviously much larger duration. Each season you add something extra to the game that probably won't stay for the next, but makes it a fresher experience.
---
Nah, denglish is legit what it's called here.
---
Its a mostly forgotten Race, forgotten somewhere in the underground of azeroth, some say, they will appear one day to take over our lovely world in a rush, surprising every old faction of azeroth.
---
US scientists use metric.
---
Hurricane, Alliance guild on grom'gar
---
Well yeah But . . . . He's a chick
---
All else aside, the reason i choose horde over alliance is that the horde has more variety of races as the alliance essentially has 3 races that are human, just different sizes (human, dwarf, gnome)
---
If i ever multi-box again, I gotta get whatever it is your using!  Awesome!
---
So taurens are giant on German servers then huh
---
&gt; if a shadow priest flatout puts out the highest DPS, than you might as well kick most of the mages, hunters, rogues and warlocks out of the raid group, because aside from some buffs they wouldn't bring anything to the table that a shadow priest can't. 
---
I don't understand this. Right now the opposite is true and I feel like we agree that it's a problem. The other classes put out the highest DPS, so there's literally no reason to ever bring a shadow priest besides their shadow weaving buff. I think the game is best when you can play whatever spec you want and still have a chance to top the charts if you know what you're doing (obviously certain fights will favor some specs over others). 
---
Also I'm not advocating for shadow priests to flat out be the highest DPS, just want them to be viable to the point where somebody who really knows what they're doing *can* top the charts. Balance.
---
End of the day though I don't want anything to change any time soon and I've come to terms with the fact that I'll probably just be focusing on PvP whenever I hit 60, but my point is that you shouldn't be penalized for picking a DPS spec in a class that has non-DPS spec options.
---
&gt; But I think what players have to understand is that in Classic you're not playing a spec but rather a class. You're not a shadow priest, you're a Priest first and foremost. If you're not willing to play all specs of your class then you've probably chosen the wrong class.
---
I wholeheartedly disagree with this. This is retail mindset imo. In retail you can change your spec willy nilly whenever you want to whereas in classic you get penalized for it. Classic *wants* you to pick a spec and stick with it.
---
I ignore it unless I'm at 100% mana then I throw them a heal because I'm not wasting mana.
---
Hi, /u/qawsican

---
Ah, that does sound annoying.
---
I main a druid, but I tank on him so I can't imagine being in the position to stealth around like that. I only need on healing gear if no one else does because I am usually the healer if I'm not tanking, but I feel bad if I take something from someone's primary role. 
---
If they do pull anything, they don't have a way to reset it though. Assuming you mean Nightelf Shadowmeld, that is out of combat only. If they get separated from the group like that I'd probably warn them and then kick them the second time it happens. Finding a DPS mid dungeon can be annoying, but having someone ruining the dungeon with idiotic behavior isn't worth it. I do the same thing when DPS starts trying to pull mobs.
---
In one of Skarms videos, he recalls a Kel thazud kill where he tanked as a feral and a feral cat was #1 DPS
---
Yes. If there's a config option built into the game, I consider it acceptable. Almost anything can be a ToS violation if Blizzard wants it to be one. In this case they just fixed it and that was the end of it.
---
Blizzard also said themselves that editing the config.wtf is ok: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20419814299#post-2
---
That's literally what this is.
---
The top half yes. The bottom half... not so much.

Turning WoW into Diablo 3 is what killed retail so I'm not a fan.

Horde side gonna be stealing this idea, looks like a blast!
---
I know it’s not an exact comparison but OSRS is probably a good way to judge the future of classic. When it released it was going strong but the numbers started dwindling once end game had been reached. They started adding original content and then the numbers started reaching all time highs.
---
Streams that end too soon?
---
why not use the auction house? this seems really unnecessary
---
but its probably a good idea to scam people with higher prices because they cant compare
---
also it circumvents the auction house tax
---
Best comment on this sub in a while
---
That happened on my Night Elf Warrior too!  I knew I had to keep the character after that.
---
Love hearing the Blaumeux love! &lt;Fellheart Hordeside&gt;
---
I really hope you don’t use pawn in retail it’s useless unless you resim after every gear change.
---
It’s not really possible for an addon to do this in classic because I don’t think there are APLs for SimCraft. 
---
You should consult prebis lists and the various spreadsheets while also taking into account common sense stuff like reaching hit cap and what race you are.
---
typical alliance using scapegoating for why they suck. is there actually a legitimate place to find the ratios? im guessing no and that youre going by "your experience so far".
---
I mean, you can also play a moonkin and still get a boss kill. Doesnt mean its a good thing to play a moonkin.
---
You can. You absolutely can. You can also raid naked, tank with a fishing pole or heal with bandages. If your group of people is fine with it, then by all means go for it.
---
However if you want to be doing decent (and im not talking minmax, im talking *decent*) there are some things that you have to do. Like not playing moonkin, like being in prot stance when tanking, and like having crowd pummelers as a raiding feral. Because otherwise (unless your entire group is happy with you doing it this way) you're wasting other people's time, its as simple as that.
---
Fucking around when you're alone wastes your own time. Fucking around in a raid wastes 39 other people's time.
---
I like humans. I play them in every game. They are aesthetically pleasing to me. So I chose alliance to start.
---
But I had the same thing done to me back in the day tho. Friend wanted horde so I went horde. I never enjoyed the character as much because I just didn’t like the way I looked(until blood elves).
---
Hopefully playing with your friend trumps what faction you are. It definitely did for me.
---
The difference is between BoE and BoP items.
---
Let's say that an epic BoE sword drops.  The rogue says "OMG I REALLY NEED THAT", so he rolls need and everybody else rolls greed.  Rogue wins it by default.  Rogue then takes the sword to the AH and sells it for 300g.
---
That's why BoE blues/purples are rolled Need.  Unless you personally know the person that you're passing to, such as fellow guildies, etc -- then the only real option is for everyone to roll need, and the winner can do whatever they want with the BoE item.
---
BoE items are literally just gold.   And everybody needs gold.
---
There are slight differences in how details and recount record damage. So if you compare your numbers to someone who used the other damage meter four the same fight, they will likely be slightly different. 
---
Personally i chose details because it has greater functionality.
---
You know how her model looks like in game right?
---
I agree more would be nice, and honestly TBC is the only expansion to make it feel like classic +, the problem is it's a slippery slope and eventually wed be back to the pepperidge farm style memes of vanilla classic
---
High quality funny memes? Removed.
---
Cosplay? To the top.
---
Dat's not gut
---
This is retail all over again.
---
Say they do this...
---
Shadow priests starts complaining they are not doing as much damage as warlocks...
---
Blizzard keeps tuning all the stats until the classes are all the same expect the name.
---
Bro, i was doing warlock quest as ali at thousand needles, can you guess how many times my tiny gnome buns was raped?
---
From what I understand if you used scientific notation( the " 9e1" part) to set the name plate distance it would override the max distance name plates would display as it was in vanilla (10 or 20 yards iirc).
---
I believe this was recently hotfixed.
---
It's not built in to the UI, you need an addon to display this, check out ClassicThreatMeter.
---
not from a jedi
---
Even the world first guilds
---
If that's the case, walls will do us no good, we must take to the sky!
---
Yes... I’m not sure how that changes me making a statement about meters and yard.
---
Rogues seem to generally be over represented on PvP servers but are middle of the road on PvE. From a pve perspective they're basically worse warriors that also can't tank and can't dominate battlegrounds on your off spec.
---
Pff.
---
I'm just joking friend
---
I do feel for you though. Hunters aren't as sough after for dungeons compared to others
---
I'd watch Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Murlocs
---
What's it like being level 60 on a server where only a few dozen people are your level? Are you guys gonna band together into an OG level 60 guild or are most of your relaxing and waiting for the rest of us to catch up? Always wondered...
---
I don’t mind it so much, I want to go back to those areas anyway to level fishing a bit. Taking an hour when I’m not up for dungeons or whatever to run around a starting area doesn’t sound so bad. But it’s good to know that it’s possible without this. 20g from 35-36 sounds like way more than I expected to make between levels right now... I think I made about 3g from 30-31
---
Probably limit that to 1 decimal place, guy.
---
Queuing up for mobs is the most millenial thing about the class release.
---
Im all for being respectful in the game. I dont steal mining nodes or herbs...but holy shit I wont queue up for an elite mob to spawn. Especially not if the people in the queue are unable to get into groups of 5. Im playing a video game not trying to buy a washing machine on Black Friday.
---
I MUST buff everyone with Mark of the Wild! Heal all people who accidentally pull two mobs! Yeah, i'm having a great time with the Classic community.
---
Also, go run the Scarlet Monastery as a ali, you will be killed every few minutes
---
If you looked at vanilla servers, the servers with the strongest economies had a huge high end raiding population.
---
I think a strong in game economy is the #1 thing that keeps casual players going at 60.
---
Who wants to farm herbs, do quests for money that can’t buy anything?  When that raiding population goes away, the sustainability of the game drops.
---
Yea. And then you're likely just grinding on greens anyway, not caring too much about quest.
---
Yep that’s the one lol.

Uh.

---
Frostblitz sounds way cooler than frostbolt.
---
That bit irritates me the most. I got a quest recently at level 22 or 23 to go to RFK and do something.  
---
RFK. At level 22. The dungeon suggested minimum is 32. Why.
---
Yeah I agree, it's not necessary.  You really just need to worry about your main stat, str, agi, int.  Having enough +hit.  Or + spell damage.  That's it.
---
Simple problem, simple solutions. They pull it, they tank it. Don’t make any effort to help DPS who do this. Tell your healer not to either. 
---
Is it a mage? Pull while they’re drinking. It’s usually a mage
---
Maybe You could try Asheville but some of the quest will be gray. Same with stonetalon
---
Me on the launch of pandaria in jade forest cause people were killing clefthoofs and all I did was sit there and skin for like two hours. Skilled up and made bank. Was awesome.
---
The comment was oriented toward M+ dungeons. Think I clicked on the wrong response. I don’t like have 2-3 versions of the same dungeon, I think that breaks immersion.
---
yes, it's the same with buffs. For example: A level 7 mage tries to cast arcane intellect on a friendly player. However that player had already been buffed by a level 27 mage with arcane intellect. The level 7 mage receives the notification, "A more powerful spell is already active." It works the same way for offensive spells. The game wont apply the effects of the 40% slow because it is worse than the 50% slow already applied, the same way it wont apply the 2 intellect boost because that person already has a 7 intellect boost.
---
Going back to WC3, you really only saw human soldiers in heavy armor (and footmen didnt really tend to live that long).  Everyone else had some kind of magic.
---
Well he killed the mage so I guess it was his mobs after all.
---
There's a whole Island full of Zandalari in the north of Stranglethorn. They were introduced as a  reputation grind at the point ZG was added.

I'm def not interested in that. I know, from having this happen to me in expansion beyond Cata, that systematic changes eventually change the fundamental elements that we fell in love with. But I would want other legacy expansions to get the same preservation that Classic has gotten. I also understand the excitement behind expanding Classic as-is. For me though, I want the class evolution and the flying etc.
---
It depends on your server, but you mentioned you have herbalism leveled up pretty well.  I've been questing and grinding out in Dustwallow which has plenty of Fadeleaf which sells pretty well on the AH of Bigglesworth.
---
Hellfire is slept on as fuuuuck, on my lock I out dps mages with it
---
You'll be surprised to find out the zandalar coming on the ZG patch 😆
---
I guess I could just throw the name out and leave it up to people to google if they are curious, but it seemed rude to not elaborate on my vernacular griping with the shorthand. Now everyone can share in my ever increasing neurotic learning of the names and noteworthy actions of various leaders across the globe in the last century. Woo.
---
I'm fully aware of that.  Still two others are required to do so :P
---
She can arise my champion anytime
---
Yes I've read it. But I'll only play dungeons here so I'd better focus on healing I guess.
---
OSRS is an obvious comparison for Classic WoW, but we need to remember that updates in RuneScape are fundamentally different. Almost every bit of content that's been added to WoW gets tacked onto the end, making the previous content nearly obsolete. RuneScape tends to add stuff that many tiers of players can enjoy and much of the endgame loot from the original content is still competitive.
---
If Blizzard goes the Classic+ route, they need to redefine what new content looks like for WoW, or we just end up in the same place.
---
If you plan on PvPing *at all* you will sincerely regret not going Engi.
---
Not really, he had cheetah on so throwing the lightning orbs would have made him slow just by attacking the shaman, ghost wolf to catch up and then you die. Shamans are really not to be fucked with. They hurt. Plus their frost shock if multi specced properly will obliterate a hunter at the same range before a hunter hurts a shaman. Can crit for 500 a pop, slows down and has a CD shorter than the duration of the spell.
---
Same for me as a shaman. Interestingly they don't change on a buff icon though.
---
Its player skill
---
I think that was part of Germany's post-WW2 reparations. Money, labor, and 10% damage nerf in WoW Classic.
---
Sell the cat and buy a bigger screen!
---
And the Fake News too.
---
Are you on Grob by any chance? Had some dude give me 2 silk bags for free in TB the other day.
---
I don't see them as another person imo. I see them as something about to be turned into a corpse, all because they're different than me - which is something I just don't tolerate in my video games.
---
I would prefer classic expansions up through WotLK, and in that time I would love to see Blizz make WoW 2.0 with an updated engine and better focus on expansion planning and story in the future.
---
Y'all say this until I do tank it then still complain that the tank needs to pull
---
Yea, I remember I was always communicative back in the day. It's just been so long, I feel like I'm re-learning. Did a small quest group for elites in Loch Modan the other day, and it didn't go all that smoothly (although we didn't have a healer, so there's that).
---
I do need to sit down and do some macro's. I haven't bothered yet for just questing, most of it solo.
---
17, I haven't had time to play in like a week.
---
That has happened to me at least twice now. I agree that I don't remember it being that way. Guess we will just have to get used to it or see if a patch changes it.
---
&gt;Players that do this, more times than not, are also toxic and have a bad attitude
---
Yeah, it's just them that are toxic.   
---
&gt;As a healer I just let dps die who intentionally disregard high damage mechanics     
---
Oh.
---
You talking about me? :D
---
Sorry /u/gizmuo but this is way more interesting than your post (congrats on the bag tho)
---
&gt;Put yourself in the shoes of a guy going for rank 14 in phase 2.
---
Nah, I like my life.
---
This is both new and interesting
---
When vending machines complain.
---
Nothing of significance happened in the past in WoW between The Sundering and The First War - a few random wars with trolls and ogres, etc. There'd be no orcs, there'd be no Night Elves, there'd be no Undead... only humans, dwarves, high elves, gnomes, trolls, and ogres essentially. Not a great setting for an MMO.
---
In Warcraft, Warcraft 2 was "The Second War", Warcraft 3 was "The Third War". Therefore, World of Warcraft 2 should be "The Second World... of Warcraft". 
---
The absolute big balls move would be creating an entirely new planet in the Warcraft universe. A world with its own ten thousand year old history, a world with its own continents, a world with its own races, a world with its own conflicts. Imagine creating a brand new starting point to the Warcraft franchise that avoids the 25 years of baggage that is following the franchise around, but still allowing themselves to pull stylistically from many of the best parts.
---
Lies, talents update tool tips. Hell all my spells get the talent modified for things likey weapon imbues , totems, etc. 
---
I imagine it's like that for everyone one. You probably just didn't notice...
---
Can you jump over them ?
---
It is, but protons are 9.36% larger, so it gets places a little bit sooner than its American counterpart
---
I try actually and I have a running joke with the guild’s warriors that they need to stay hydrated!
---
hahahaha, omg, please make more!
---
"Where are we going?"  
---
"Bis zu dir nach Hause ins Schlafzimmer!"
---
Do Test of Faith quest chain in Thousand Needles.
---
It would be interesting and with the rate of content they release before people have “completed” it, it lends to the idea that they are trying to keep the raiding population engaged.
---
Honestly I’d attribute the worst parts of retail to catering to the bottom 40% of people. 
---
There used to be a whole lot involved with “getting prepared” for raiding, which forced you to learn certain parts of the game.  You had to do difficult dungeons to get gear to get into raids, to get into t2 raids you had to have t1 gear, to get into AQ40 you had to have t2 gear, and so on and so forth.
---
These don’t really exist anymore, your talents and rotation are identical to everyone else in your class, your gear choices are ultra limited, if you skip a tier of raiding, you’ll probably never see it, just use the catchup mechanic and done. Professions are just a “more damage” thing that everyone has to have 2 of.
---
&gt; You shouldn't be leveling through dungeons in classic 
---
Have you not seen the meta, one of the best xp per hour options is to spam dungeons in melee cleave or mage aoe, a ton of server first 60's go there doing this.
---
Never seen it happen.
---
Anyone educated wants it. The only holdouts are idiots.
---
I already switched it IF once I started doing SM.  It's closer to SM, ULD, boat for ZF and Tanaris.  And then it's closer to BRM.  It starts being the better place around lvl 40.
---
I like being an adventurer. Blizz messing with hero was weird. “Oh you’ve defeated Ragnaros, deathwing, the Lich king, illidan and sha enhanced garrosh?  Nice. Go kill some of these wolves for me hero because that’s really not that impressive. Kthx
---
Mostly seeing dumb jokes by Americans here.
---
2H shaman with WF crit proc is the only reason I decided to play Classic. I can't wait till end game!
---
Go to shimering flats and do the q there youll get the meats as you complete them
---
&gt;it was just like "hey, here's a group invite"
---
Which is exactly why nobody used the system because it was infinitely more beneficial to just spam in W an be able to /who and inspect someone beforehand.
---
&gt; (excluding the teleportation)
---
And the extra rewards, and the fact that to get a better one you could only queue for a random dungeon.
---
Project 1999
---
I think you're probably right, outside of some pretty intense RP-PVP stuff. But that's pretty organized, so not true WPVP
---
I, too, give unending breath to random players!
---
Pro tip, don't let it effect your grades. If you let it, it will (speaking from experience).
---
You described how you don't know how to use taunt in your own words.
---
I do know that, was just to mention that we do not have to wait for travel form lvl 30 to get fast too
---
So glad you have the option to play on a RP PVE server.
---
Give me cloak of shadows and casters will run for the hills
---
I'm having mobs that I never attacked aggro to me, even though they should be running back to a place well beyond where I'm fighting. It's seriously aggravating.
---
Horde does plenty of this too. I was ganked multiple times yesterday by a group of 5 horde all of which were much higher leveled while I was simply doing a quest.
---
What’s the addon? I’d like to try that.
---
Krom is terrible. Supper laggy, terrible community and unbalanced towards whatever faction you play. You don't want to play on it. (Okay, okay I'm lying for the sake of keeping the queue low).
---
I enjoy Krom, I play horde on it. Ganking has been in a good spot so far. I dont get corpse camped, but a passing high leveled ally usually throws a dot or something on me. Which is to be expected.
---
Our server discord has the stats on faction ratio. I think it's slightly favored horde, but I haven't looked in a hot minute.
---
dumb question - what constitutes an uncontested mob?
---
Chuckles in bubbles.
---
A few things for Alliance players:
---
* Hilsbrad Foothills is 30-35
---
* Tanaris is 42-50
---
* Ashenvale is 20-30
---
* Duskwood is 28-35
---
My retadin with 30% raid epics (ICC 25) and 70% PvP epics was around 26k HP. Don't remember my dps.
---
I discovered that chinese version of spells are really small. All the spell range is 2 inches, dunno why
---
well at least you have a taunt
---
100% this.   
---
It's so strange this mentality of "unless you do things absolutely perfect then I won't do my job". Setting up these rules to rationalise not doing your job. On one hand people are praising Classic because it feels like discovery for the first time again, and the game is actually challenging. On the other people are berated for being Retail noobs, and AoE tanking is too hard. 
---
Tanking is easy, just tank the damage. If someone's making things complicated, overcome it and grow. If they're putting the entire run in danger, communicate your wishes to them. But don't hold their HP hostage to some inane "You pull it you tank it"-rule. The game is challenging and you need to communicate with others - that's why this specific game is better than retail.
---
oh boy are you going to wake up when you move out into the real world.
---
So more MAGES?!?!..It's the whole "problem" of OP to begin with ;)
---
Nah im on Westfall
---
So rednecks are just germanic english purists!
---
Quite often, yeah. But you make sure that your tank is on board with the plan, and you let the tank get aggro on remaining mobs before starting DPS.
---
.... repair costs?
---
Thats true but those people often looking for Multiple rund, and as an aoe mage he has no truble finding a new group. So waiting 15 mins for an effectice group to grind Multiple hours with is indeed fester than running a few rund with an ineffective Party.
---
What? We're thirsty.
---
If I had all three in front of me, I would classic+ expansions, but would totally be happy with just classic+
---
If some folks want “seasons” for classic with server resets and all that, let them, but I think that’s to much for most players.
---
see dude your problem is you look at this game as nothing but raiding. and that's more power to you, go be the big bad boss slayer, but that's not all there is to an MMORPG (contrary to what retail would have you believe).
---
you can call me an RPer all you want, no clue where that even came from. i used to be in a server-first raiding guild, i've done the hardcore shit, but i want an MMORPG. apparently you don't. that's fine, but don't shit on niche abilities because they don't fit into your awesome pve rotation.
---
Locks are fast as fuck leveling. They also have several different and super viable PvP specs. PvE damage is in the top-tier also. They provide utility with summons, soulstones, healthstones, and banish. Some more optional utility with pets, like party wide health buff, a CC, dispels, sac the blueberry.
---
Hunter is not as good pre-TBC as in TBC. Maybe at release, but this is a mix of 1.12 and 1.2 talents and itemization.
---
Or just don't bring a tank. Much easier.
---
Ask a guard.
---
&gt;if your within three levels of me and I’m not going to a dungeon it’s on. 
---
This has actually been annoying me a lot. Like man I'm just trying to quest but always get engaged on after killing mobs at low health. I'll fight you if you want, but what's the point when you're just engaging on me low health or when I used cooldowns? I just spam laugh and watch them kill me because it seems pointless to fight back.
---
Addon leatrix plus add more zoom
---
Why settle for anything less than the best.
---
That's fair. Even in the mid level zones like Ashenvale and Duskwood I've started having problems with overcrowding. When that happens though I'll either go fishing/herbing for a while or hop on an alt and do some questing on them.
---
But I understand your viewpoint.
---
Last night my guild leader said he want to be doing MC this weekend.  I took a look at the guild roster and we don't have a single person at level 60 yet.  Most of the guild is in the 30-40 range...  Most players haven't even touched endgame dungeons like BRD and Strat, let along being ready for raids.
---
I think some people have very unrealistic ideas about how quickly they are going to be crushing endgame.  I am fin with taking my time and leveling slow.  W waited a long time for this and I intend to savor it.  There is plenty of time to enjoy the game.
---
I dont care about max level, the gear I want is locked away in future phases anyway. I started over again and I am lvl24 lol.
---
Same. Like you I have limited time to play and it’s not that I don’t enjoy pvp because i do but I just don’t want my leveling experience to take twice as long because someone decided to corpse camp me.   You explained it perfectly.  Nothing against pvp players or running on a pvp server because I use to be one.  Just don’t have the time for it anymore.
---
not as dramatic as not joining a party for all of 30 seconds to tag a mob for no real good reason!
---
Given the login queues, are these "cool" players just being jerks?
---
Barren chat keeps throwing the words boomer and zoomer around and I’m not really sure what they mean in the context of WoW? Are boomers people who used to play and zoomers are new players?
---
I also just find it incredibly frustrating getting ganked and killed?
---
I do not enjoy having distractions I cannot prevent stopping me from achieving what I want. 
---
I’m sure lots of people enjoy PvP in this game, but I do not.
---
Is going back on your word something to be proud of ?
---
Consider my champion arised
---
Good bot
---
I think the problem is that you're confusing "content" with "meta" and "gameplay experience."
---
"Content" consists of items, dungeons, quests, etc.   You can always add new items/dungeons/quests without altering or removing the previous items/dungeons/quests.
---
"Meta" and "gameplay experience" involves things like "what item combination gives me the best DPS?"    Adding new items to the game *will* change the meta.  Players will figure out new/creative ways to use those new items to do cool things.
---
That's why Blizzard can easily add new content, without changing the existing content.
---
I know this is going to sound real weird, but let me reach back to 2005 in my head here and... yup, vanilla wow definitely still had dungeons and even mages! Which means that people out there definitely dungeon spammed or aoe grinded to get their exp. I dont know where this idea that no one spammed dungeons or aoe grinded in 2005 came from, but its honestly laughable at best, moronic and based in pure jealousy at worst.
---
Power budget (and rotation down time) is also a large reason. Cone of Cold does virtually no damage on retail because the power of that spell is budgeted elsewhere, particularly into frozen orb and blizzard.
---
Same goes for spells like Frostbolt. Frostbolt pre-Legion dealt a considerable amount of damage on its own and was a large portion of a mage's damage, with Ice Lance and Frostfire Bolt procs being fun bonus procs. Post-Legion however the power of Frostbolt was budgeted into Ice Lance and Flurry procs, which turned Frostbolt into a wet noodle in terms of damage which made it lose its "oomph" it had in previous expansions so it could become a builder ability for Ice Lance and Flurry procs.
---
Idk the exact HP and dmg numbers, but a Frostbolt on a player in BFA does roughly 8k damage on a healthpool of 300k~. That would be equivalent to your Frostbolt hitting 80 on a healthpool of 3000 in Classic.
---
Why would the amount of time change if you want to pvp or not.  If you have 13 hours a day you'll want to get ganked? Nah man you're a casual who's afraid of pvp don't make excuses.
---
Dude lol imagine if Worgen became a playable race. Like wtf that would be insane!
---
I love the chaos of being on a PvP server keeps it fresh to me but to each their own. Even with limited time I don't mind loosing progress to pvp. Last night I went to quest for afew hours just spent the time pvping in badlands gained 2 bars of xp still fun to me but as I said each their own when I first played classic I did PvE b.c I did not want to be inconvienced now I want to try the crazy Wpvp everyone used to talk about and love it so far. Granted lvl 50 so probably have abit more free time than you atm.
---
I didnt say it was. YOU are the one pretending it's a general consensus. So either talk to your pug beforehand or cry after you lose a blue you though was just going to be charity for you
---
get skinning and skin stuff and sell to vendor.
---
Dont tell me what to do
---
I imagine it is normal since it's the same way with the buffs, the level 7 mage doesnt reset the timer on the Arcane Intellect back to 30 minutes.
---
The problem with taking the osrs approach is that development work is going to be much, much more expensive. Blizzard stated that they have a lot of the groundwork done for TBC / Later with the classic "engine", so I can't see them doing classic+ unless the payoff is significantly higher than normal progression.
---
Be cool though.
---
How dare you say something so controversial, there is no way that players are better after playing for 15 years! Retail players will never be able to handle the grueling mechanics.
---
It is the general consensus.
---
and its freanking steong against rogues with riposte
---
All you can do is use the ability and hope it hits, the sooner the better.
---
Like I said against rogues, battle stance to capitalize on their dodge. Warriors will be a continuous swap, battle for overpowers and berserker to break a fear if they use it. Once it’s used it’s on cd for awhile so you don’t have to worry as much
---
To each his own. My story is the opposite. All my friends went PVE for vanilla and now I want to face the challenge of a PVP server. I don’t think any less of people who play on PVE servers especially after launch. I’m sure there are people who ended up on a PVE server just to be able to play at all.
---
There's 3. Tanaris, Booty Bay and Everlook.
---
I got a small green pouch in my starting area, and on the very next mob I got a small red pouch. I couldn’t believe it.
---
Corpsemaker lives up to its name
---
super analytical. so basically wait a few years until the game population dies of boredom and only then have a discussion about the future of the game and start work on whatever you decide to do?
---
im no game developer but i dont really think this is a great way of doing business.
---
in principle though i dont disagree with your primary arguement of the fact that blizz needs to be fluid, this however brings about a new set of problems.
---
I wonder if there will still be the glitch to make flights instant of you hit someone with a snowball as they start the flight path.
---
I would agree with you if the content they are blowing through wasn’t already 15 years old.  This is not new stuff.  People have been playing it for more than a decade.
---
I think it’s very understandable that people want new content that takes the classic design into account to move things forward.
---
Is there any way to transfer money from Alliance to Horde on the same server? Maybe Booty Bay AH or sth?
---
I play shaman, can often help a good dps warrior reach full potential.
---
That's what he said
---
with you on this. let it be what it is. i have no problem with them adding BC later or turning on some sort of heroic dungeon system, but we haven't even opened up world PvP or AQ or other Vanilla endgame content. let people get to 60 and get one or two alts there as well and then we can talk about what the future of Classic.
---
Bro go outside of IF/ORG and get the free fruit from the banquet
---
Hmm makes sense. Thanks ^^
---
That's like... Your opinion, man.
---
Boy is you stupid? I am guessing you are talking about agility being good but you pref want both and strength is amazing still.
---
Fear Ward is great and all, but the real benefit of Dwarf Priest in PvP is Stoneform. Removes Bleed, Poison, and Diseases with 10% bonus armor which is invaluable vs Rogues - especially Undead Rogues that you can't fear. You can Stoneform out of Blind which is huge, and removes crippling/wound poisons.
---
Gotta be honest. You're contemplating quitting a paladin one level before you get a free mount... there is no scenario where I don't question that judgement.
---
I also found these 2 maps super helpful as well:
---
https://imgur.com/a/aHyCnjz
---
You'll likely get honored just from doing regular quests. There's a lot of spillover and honored doesn't take much rep.
---
Night elves (except hunters, and maybe druids?) can leave the zone at level 1... which I recommend, since Teldrassil is fucking miserable.
---
Maybee a little bit of topic but two friends startet recently to play on a private wotlk server because they didnt want to pay for classic. One of them never played wow bevor. I told him go mage its cool. He giggled like a little kid for 5 minutes when he got blink. It was fantastic.
---
That's always the difficult part: What to do with those people? 
---
Starting to tell them over and over again the old story of threat management?
---
What if they don't listen? Kick or continue taling? 
---
On a sidenote the same goes with loot. A friend of mine recently kicked a rogue out of his WC group because he rolled need on a druid thing with int and willpower. 
---
"But they're better than mine, that's why i rolled need". How the hell are they 'better' for you? More armor?
---
I'm not sure what to do. Kick or talk. It seems like both ways don't work until those people admit they're wrong. That usually only works if a friend talks to them, but strangers can't really do much. 
---
Another friend was really pissed because a tank rolled need on a dagger. "Why would a tank need a dagger!" he shouted. I, as a tank and a friend, explained why it is indeed an extremely good choice for tanks so he understood and apologized. 
---
What's the level of knowledge you're supposed to know? 
---
What's the level of stupidity you're supposed to tolerate?
---
What can I say, I’m kind of an edgelord. Can’t hold back my hot takes
---
\*About every hour until 45, If your party knows what to do
---
Most warriors not using sweeping strikes with rage pooling &amp; cleave and stance switching properly.
---
I bet people had the skill to press 1 button and aim the aoe in 2005 too.
---
Or my personal favorite - intimidating shout + bandage. Gotta get healed up and prep for the 3 extra mobs they just pulled.
---
If Staff of Jordan drops I need it. I don't care if I'm playing on a warrior and you still have staff of westfall.
---
Great idea ! Yes please
---
It was insane last night listening to guild chat go off, while us ~50s were dying to multiple bored level 60s prepping for raids/brs in searing gorge.
---
IIRC, flying mounts only worked in a few very limited areas pre-Cata.
---
Sure MMOs are about gearing up and becoming more powerful to take on my difficult content but WoW made that irrelevant for anything but max level. 
---
There is no joy in leveling in retail WoW, it’s a pointless time consumption. You may as well hand out max level characters and let people start from there. 
---
I would probably play retail if I didn’t have to waste countless hours on brainless content before getting to the challenging stuff.
---
I'm really annoyed with this meta it's just not in the spirit of classic at all. I've had countless experiences out in the world questing where I've met other players and teamed up to tackle quests together and even stick around for eachother after one of us finished the quest so they dont have to struggle on their own. No lfg, just people being brought together by a common goal. Meeting random people you end up working with and questing alongside for hours is what makes classic so much fun. It's the social aspect everyone wanted back and now people are just hiding in instances bum rushing to 60 and not experiencing any of it. I cant imagine the toxic behavior that this method of leveling will bring with it. Something has to be off that blizzard overlooked because this NEVER happened on private servers to this scale. I just dont understand how things like raid xp and now demo shout flew under the radar after the multiple betas we had.
---
I swear, I was not AFK'ing, I was sleeping.

Any tips on making some decent money from alchemy?
---
Where should I quest at level 25? Don't have much left in Wetlands, Ashenvale was filled with alotttt of Horde made things kind of difficult. Are there any other options? I don't mind questing somewhere slightly below my level range so long as quests are still yellow and green. Thanks!
---
Yeah idk how I feel about letting cosplay posts in /r/classicwow
---
Before you know it all the posts are just karma whoring and not about the actual game.
---
Was watching this initially on mute. Finally thought when he was chasing the dwarf, “Wait, this would be awesome with some chase music.” 
---
Was not disappointed 10/10
---
Your latency won't be an issue playing on a West coast server, however keep in mind that if you try to get into raiding later, you may find it harder to find a guild because they will all be 3 hours behind you. Depending on your schedule, it's something to keep in mind
---
I started my druid last week, I got like 3 bags to drop within 5 lvls. That set me up so good for vendoring lots of greys early on.
---
Give [this](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Health_regeneration) a quick read. 
---
Basically, Warriors have insane HP regen and get a huge benefit from Spirit. The best thing to do is to carry a spirit set for regen. You can actually level a warrior with very little to no food. I'd say Stam &gt; Str=Spirit &gt; Agi is the best stat priority while leveling. After 40 you need the extra damage so Stam &gt; Str &gt; Spirit &gt; Agi
---
What dungeons should I run at 31? (Horde)
---
If your not going into an inn and sitting in a chair or laying on a bed before you log out your doing it wrong.
---
There is a site that lets you upload census data but it seems mostly ally have uploaded cause it shows it as 2 to 1 ally vs horde and me as a horde on Arugal know it is more horde rhan ally. Yojamba on the other hand I think is more ally than horde it's Frostmourne and Barthilas all over again.
---
Im certain people had the skill to press 1 button and aim the aoe in 2005 too.
---
they will want to when theres already 3 clothies in the group

&gt; lf DD (no cloth)

is what i see quite frequently
---
This is such a shame. I’ve been overly excited that sheep is actually useful in classic. Did you know you can sheep bosses still? I sheeped two of the WC bosses the other day when someone face pulled them.
---
US lost the war of 1812... and we tried to invade Canada during it lmao
---
I mean can try but you will be frozen the entire time and they can blink really bit much you can do. I literally /lol and /dance jump around dumb how much frost mage counters warrior. But that's vanilla PvP in general some classes will get RIPed by others. I get anal destroyed from SP.
---
as will all other 40-man raids in vanilla. my guild made us put that stupid 3% hit chance on our bows back in the day so we wouldn't miss a single tranq on huhuran back in the day. love that blizzard's solution to bringing hunters in raids was to add a dumb mechanic that forced raids to bring them, as opposed to, you know, making them not suck?
---
* Never shield a warrior tank unless it will save his life on the next hit.  Warrior tanks build rage from being hit and power word shield denies that resource.

* Renew is an easy heal to throw on people who are damaged.  I typically toss two when I am casting it.  Most dps who know what they are doing will get splash or minor damage but won't keep aggro.  A HoT or heal over time is enough to keep them out of danger without taking more attention
---
* Max rank heals are the most mana efficient.  That said, they also overheal a ton.  It's worthwhile waiting for your heal to have maximum or close to max effect before landing it.  Get used to preemptively casting then canceling the cast by jumping or moving.
---
* Your biggest threat is your own mana bar.  Don't be shy about asking mages for water.  Have a good supply of your own.  You will have more mana if you cast in bursts.  Your mana doesn't start to regen until you've stop casting for 5 seconds.  Which is why it's better to drop two renews on your party then 1 wait a few seconds then another.
---
* Fade is very critical and you should keep max ranks of it at all times ready.  It's easy to pull aggro from adds with your heals.  A quick fade can break aggro.
---
* For practice healing, try joining a lower dungeon group.  This will help you get good practices on knowing when to heal and your level will help keep you from going oom as quickly.
---
* If you have nothing to do and everyone is at max health or close to it, wand the target.  More dps means less damage overall.  Just don't get carried away and start mindblasting or smiting.
---
Oh my.
---
In reminded of the guy with a dollar on a fishing line. You gotta be quicker than that.
---
First off, if against something ranged, hopefully you start the fight out of combat and in combat stance so you can charge, that little bit of beginning rage helps.
---
Keep Hamstring up if possible, keeping your opponent slowed really helps if you want to rend them and run out of their range to let them bleed
---
Keep Rend up. It allows you to do some damage without actually being within range of most classes to do damage back.
---
Always switch to combat stance when something dodges and you can Overpower. Seriously, its instant cast, maybe free?(been awhile not 100%) and hits like a truck
---
Don't be afraid to carry a 1Her/Shield with you to switch to along with Defensive stance if you're being kited without Intercept up.
---
Heroic Strike is a Q'd attack that can be used in combination with your autos or instant abilities. Essentially letting you "combo"
---
Intimidating Shout and bandage is a viable strategy.
---
Notice that Berserker Stance makes you take increased damage while also dealing out increased damage. You don't want your 2Her out while in Berserker Stance when you get opened on by a rogue or most other classes for that matter.
---
Warriors in Classic have a bit of a learning curve to them because you have to learn how to dance through your stances depending on how the fights going.
---
It may be worth checking out Swiftys Vanilla videos from back in the day. I'd assume they're still relevant. There's a reason why the guy is super popular today in the WoW community.
---
That's all I can think of, I'm not a warrior main but played a good deal of Vanilla. GL buddy
---
No changes
---
This makes no sense at all.  Queues are based on how many people are trying to log into a server.  Once the server is at capacity and no more layers are made, then the queue begins.
---
Blizzard has already stated when layering is removed the server will receive a new cap of players appropriate to the classic experience, this change will result in queues being created again even for servers not experiencing them during layering.  It's literally in the blue posts about it.  
---
I pointed this out several times before release, I also pointed out and correctly calculated the queues for Herod and the like, and yet people still want to believe things that aren't true.
---
Make no mistake about it, when layering is removed after phase one, those servers go from a capacity of about 35,000 players down to about 3,500 players.  It does not stay the same, Blizzard was very very clear about that.  
---
A server listed as "high" nearing the "full" mark we when layering is removed will see queues in excess of 25,000 easily.
---
I would never abandon dungeon quests, they are always spread out across the world and very time consuming to pick up again.
---
What I do is abandon quests that are red/orange to me in hubs. Because one, I won't be doing it anytime soon and two, I'll be returning to that hub at some point.
---
I don't understand how you took so little damage and then just demolished him..
---
Not a exploit. Pretty sure everyone did this in classic in and vanilla for all kinds of solo dungeon runs
---
Am I able to leave notes for opposing faction as well?
---
Nah man, I get home and will finally play maybe on the 20th. Stuff sucks, but nobody can be late.
---
I role play.  It's fun!
---
You know the Redridge quest where you take Parker his lunch and then buy flowers for Darcy and Darcy says something like "Oh, these are from that florist chick.  I think Parker is kind of into her."
---
I role played with Darcy when I did that quest, "No, no.  He's really into you.  I bet if I come back here in a few years you'll be happily married with a couple of kids living in a guard tower on the edge of town."
---
When I got to Westfall I slapped the crap out of Mrs. Saldean.
---
I can understand that.    I rolled a PvP server this time around, I enjoy the rush of PvP when I have a group.   But when I just want to chill and do quests by myself the horde are always camping me and telling me to go to retail.   Incedeous or however you spell it doesn't seem pretty even ratio wise, but I could be wrong.   There is a certain joy I get when a horde player and myself help each other with mobs.  It's this unspoken bond.   For me that's the real magic of a PvP server.   There are times that I want to just roll on a normal server, but for every shitty moment I have, especially right now in the 30-40 grind, there are 15 great moments.   But knowing that you have certain amount of time is good to know.   I'm glad you are at least enjoying the game.
---
Around what level do Pallys start to get fun? My pally alt is level 9 and so far its been a chore to level him up. Guess Im just wondering around which level you start to actually feel like a Paladin if that makes sense?
---
Fuck the line and fuck you.
---
&gt; There is no joy in leveling in retail WoW, it’s a pointless time consumption
---
Says you. I leveled up a ton of characters in Legion because I enjoyed the class campaigns and artifact quest chains. Haven't played BFA, but Legion was fantastic.
---
If anything now wars are even more useless for aoe spam. Ideal group imo is 3 mage 1 warlock 1priest.
---
Warlock uses eye, priest bubbles eye, “tank” mage frost barrier+priest bubble gets agro, nova, then the mages cycle nova while blizzing for the win. 
---
Personally I hate it and I push my group to do harder instances at lower levels for the challenge and fun but the exp efficiency is just on another level.
---
OP/Shammy definitely got good RNG, but he also just massively outplayed the Hunter.
---
It isn't cool to own people, man.
---
Same thing. Have you seen SM/ZF runs in action? You *don't* want the warrior tanking mobs, because he will just drain all healer's mana and die. After the initial pull (if you're using a warrior in the first place) he just backs off and watches mobs die.
---
Can confirm, also got the belt
---
guessing one of them is wearing spell damage gear.
---
You have to assume people will play for at least the one month sub. After that all bets are off.
---
I always wanted to be a gnome paladin in vanilla , can they become paladins now?
---
This inspired me... so I made my own guild called "Orgrimmar Auc Exchange".
---
It doesn't, but without it you won't have an on-demand instant cast damaging ability to make up for the loss of Shield Slam. 
---
You could go with something like this which is closer to what you are describing: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/353203003020105--55040033030001](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/353203003020105--55040033030001)
---
I would think being able to stance dance for making good use of Mocking blow would be key to this kind of tanking though.
---
My faction pride has only become stronger since Slyvanas started her shenanigans, helping Baine and Saurfang is some pretty heavy Horde goodness.
---
What's the chat addon?
---
I wouldn't be against Blizzard setting a date for Burning Crusade.
---
But it would definitely need to be based on projections of what the majority of the playerbase is on in terms of progression, not the bleeding edge.
---
New player here. How do you see the LFG channel?
---
I was PVP in vanilla and won't do it again.  It wastes a lot of time questing and leveling up when someone attacks you.  PVE was less frustrating for me.  
---
The only reason why anyone went PVP to being with was because there were no BGs.  For all we knew, world PVP was going to be the only way to do any pvp of any kind.  So people who wanted the full game open to them went PVP.
---
Now that we know BGs will be out and that will be how most people do pvp, there is no need to join that type of server anymore.  PVE is fine if you have no interest in attacking the opposite faction in the world while questing.
---
And now I’m Woke
---
I’m a warrior and will never respond when I see another warrior saying “LF1M Tank” ...I’m just like bro you are a tank
---
I don't know anything about Warcraft lore but from a logistical standpoint I don't see how humans ever even stood a fucking chance against the horde races in hand to hand warfare.
---
It would be unplayable if they didn't (or an alternative to it). That's not the same.
---
Just got mine from a rogue friend in my guild for a pretty cheap price. He thought they were garbage.
---
Welp, never gonna change outta these unless I'm pvping!
---
THIS IS PVP
---
Im with the celebrant now, was really just a joke  :)
---
&gt;If you can’t accept people are better now you are either completely ignorant or willfully naive.
---
Cause there so much player skill in pressing 1 button and wait for the bar to end right? lol delusional
---
It inhibits their ability to generate rage
---
Yeet
---
Shhhh let me blame my life problems on wow.
---
We wouldn't, let classic stay the way it is.
---
I'm also not sure on the disgruntled comments from other classes, hunter frost trap helps wonders in aie and they do decent dmg. A shadow priest can convert a scarlet wizard for example, and pump out 1k dps.
---
I main Warlock and Priest and here's what I'd recommend for you and Warlocks:
---
1.) Warlocks use life tap during battle, and in those moments heal them. It shouldnt be a huge mana draw because that would mean they're NOT DPSing. They should tap until they can cast, cast, and then tap again. A HoT generally is sufficient.
---
2.) Warlocks may life tap between after expending a large amount of mana. If you can afford to heal them, ok go ahead. But they should have food, or just let their life refill passively. Or let them life drain lol. That's really their responsibility. Just because they're low on life doesn't mean you have to pick up the slack. What if a Warrior stood in fire between pulls? Would you feel compelled to heal them too? It's their responsibility.
---
Healers up in arms over life tap is really a non issue. Warlocks demanding heals between pulls is really idiotic. Everyone else uses their own consumables and Warlocks can too.
---
The "fastest" way should also be the hardest
---
Want to AoE the entire instance and do it really fast? then you better be good. Otherwise do it the more safe, traditional route.
---
Right now AoEing the entire dungeon is not only the fastest, it's the easiest. You are intentionally making it harder by doing it "properly" and that for me is a big issue.
---
I'm in sm because I can only play on prime time where every mob in the zone is dead
---
It upsets me I can't skin tauren. But I will keep trying :)
---
Lol ! That is a legit Classic story! A buddy of mine who has never played wow before ever didn't know you could run back to your corpse he kept spirit rezing and waiting on rez sickness. Lol
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill
---
I was talking about classic+. By classic+ people mean to add content to classic, not expansions.
---
for sm though I have no trouble out dpsing mages in aoe pulls. Hellfire Rips and with hearthstones potions and void sacs im just fine when I do pull aggro. I know late game their aoe is more viable cause of survivability but leveling warlock is a fine spell cleave choice
---
I remember never reading anything about WorLK or Cat, and then finding out there's fucking portals all over the place for fast travel. As a mage I was like "WTF". 
---
Then I remade my mage on classic and it reinforced my point when I couldn't port anywhere until level 20; there's an inherent value in forcing players to travel long distances. The world felt bigger, more real, more immersive, more consequential. Of course when I hit level 20 I was happy to have teleporting ... which in lies the problem. Players routinely want something that makes the worse.
---
Level 14 enhancement shaman, curious about what I need to be doing for my first dungeon run in RFC. I don't have any Int gear to strictly focus on healing, so do I just play it for now as a hybrid dps/healer and just focus on keeping totems up?
---
They're easily worth more tbh, later on at least.
---
Make sure you haven't bound that combination to a different action
---
Didn’t say pvp god. You can’t argue that being properly specced is a big advantage.
---
Amen!
---
If you dinged 40, you're probably already \~100 hours in /played - playing an average 5+ hours a day since launch. That isn't level 60 grind, but that is dedication. 
---
It's only 2 weeks 3 days old :)
---
make your own groups.
---
My husband is AoE farming and ugh I know I can't tell him how to enjoy his game but I'm scared he's going to burn himself out. His excuse is that he'll fall behind the rest of us when school gets tough but damn so far he's blowing everyone out of the water.
---
Ok troll.
---
Dude, I sit on roads invisible and wait for alliance scum to walk by.

Fucking awesome.

30 Distance Units =~ 30 Ingame Yards =~ 30 Ingame Meters

I always throw them heals, it's so sad always seeing them at 20% health.
---
That's hot!
---
Hah, wasn't expecting that, given how everyone levels super fast😂
---
Turtles have feet???? Unacceptable
---
&gt;Do people think the gankers care when you stop fighting back? For now it’s “Cool guess I get to save ammo and mana,” and soon it’ll be “Cool, free honor.” And emotes just make it feel better, always satisfying killing a spitter.
---
Naw, just showing you your a dick with no honor. You're not showing you are better than that person and you don't get any reward from it. What are you trying to prove? You can get the last hit on me when I'm at 100hp already? Congrats 👍.
---
Killing someone farming when they're low hp is scummy, change my mind.

Oh thank god. This has been bugging me so much.

Now thats a true Hero.
---
"Please stop talking about the future also here's what I want to happen in the future and my opinion is the best so that's what I think should happen in the future"

I see these examples you provided as very limited scope/complex mechanics. I wouldnt use these examples and claim that the game as immensely bug ridden...
---
An alliance warrior might have a hard time with the jump from Wetlands to Dustwallow by him/herself, and that's if they can even reach "cap" in each zone with the quests alone. Wetlands in particular scales quest difficulty (level) really quickly. 
---
Probably a lot of mob grinding involved to make this work.
---
Both of them did
---
Druid's make amazing tanks for pre-raid dungeons. They have solid threat and actually do solid damage compared to prot warriors.
---
Have you even seen a *fully* shaven Tauren?  They're really just giant balls of fluff.
---
That's why Tauren have no unarmed strike skill:  It'd be like punching someone with a pillow.
---
*FACTS*
---
Illusionary rod is great for hunters too. The last good hunter weapon is lvl18 crescent staff.
---
If you have a horde shaman or priest looking at you, your fear ward is just a waste of mana at that point, regardless of how many warlocks there are.  Good pvp shamans/priests will strip you of all your buffs.  Dropping your shadow resist, your health, your armor, and any other buffs is huge.
---
Fear ward is mostly for PvE encounters where bosses fear important targets, like main tank or tank healers.
---
Stoneskin is the PvP racial you need and it's good but not incredible.  Helps you live a bit longer but not forever.
---
Fairbanks-US, just STV being STV my guy.
---
You don't need those,  just use the silver gained by selling, vendor price and deposit fee and you can determine what percentage of the time you need to sell to make a profit.
---
I mean I'd personally really enjoy TBC, not any time soon.. But after all  phases. It would be really fun to explore outland again for the first time. It really was a good expansion. The raids were great, they should release that into classic after a while.
---
Saying what everyone else wants is pretty ignorant. I absolutely want to relive TBC/WTLK. 
---
We should get to transfer our toons to the new servers and keep some classic servers up. 
---
It’s absolutely possible, it’s huge in the private server scene. We deserve the legit offering form Blizzard.
---
Roll on mankrik. I play there. Community is great. People are helpful. Every zone is populated with all levels running around doing stuff. Auction house always has items and mats. Guilds are large and there are many. Horde and alliance are close to 40/60 pop id say. Only little bit of carebearing(ally helping hordees vice versa. World pvp still happens literally day one on the 27th ally raided xroads and a few days ago horde raided darkshore. I love this server. We all here would welcome you home if you joined. One last thing only ever had a 10min wait queue to login.
---
How did they ruin it? I understand you don't like current wow, but that doesn't mean nobody does.
---
GSE
---
I followed two mages in the barrens last night and just skinned their leftovers on my way to ratchet
---
Amazing
---
Unique classic content. Maybe open up kul'tiras, pandera, icecrown, Islands and what not that were there but weren't "discovered" no outlands maelstrom Argus thou.
---
Its such a fucking shame what they did to HotS. I was enjoying it more than any other MOBA. My Diablo and Stitches were awesome.
---
The alliance finally attacked us last night after constantly attacking them since launch. What a battle.
---
I've been waiting for this to happen as i wanted to experience what it is like to be invaded. I have to say it's just as good as doing the attacking if not better in many ways.
---
When we go in, it's easy pickings at first but as their side mobilizes it becomes overwhelming most of the time. Now i know why. Your whole faction basically gets wind of it and everyone drops what they are doing and heads to help.
---
The coolest moment by far was landing then watching player, after player, after player, after player, after player just flying in was f'ing EPIC moment. The constant stream of incoming players was something i'll never forget. You can't even describe the feeling of unity.
---
My old work laptop from like 2012 with an integrated video card can play Classic smooth. Low settings mind you, but the game still looked great. I'd be shocked to find any pc in circulation that cannot run it. 
---
... still, as people said load the trial version to get an idea.
---
Oh yeah I remember that
---
(for now)
---
Ron -"Screw professions, ill lvl those when spiders fly!"
---
Some other chump - "Uhh, ron..."
---
Ron - "Oh sure, lemme guess. There's a giant flying spider now?"
---
Yeaaah son, this is what vanilla is all about
---
DAE think they are better than everyone because they actually take their time and have FUN playing ????
---
Somebody's not getting blessed
---
First column c then column b. I think adding maps and mobs from the other expansions would be fine, but I think the skills should be fixed, level cap should stay at 60, no flying mounts, etc. Rebuild all the loot to be usable at 60 and rebalance it to work. All mobs in the future expansions should be lvl adjusted to work. Basically just the expansions become more end game content that is already created so it's nowhere near as much work to reuse those mob and zone models. Progression guilds can work towards clearing the new content, but at 60. Then each rental expansion and possible brand new expansions can bring new content while the game still plays exactly the way everyone desired.
---
Paladins give you the unique ability to watch Netflix on a second screen while you level.  What's not fun about that?
---
But seriously, they never feel like a retail paladin.  Even at max level, your attack rotation consists of Judge/re-Seal periodically.  You are entirely at the mercy of Seal of Casino making big numbers fly up for it to be fun.
---
Of course, but that only matters if a mob lives longer than a few seconds. If you're only going to get a handful of autos, it's not worth the rage investment. Against something like the Stone Golems in BFD though, absolutely you have to Sunder them.
---
I do not want any expansions. Look where it ended...
---
I'm not pushing anything I'm saying make sure you enjoy what your are doing not playing the optimal thing because it's optimal.
---
I hope they increase it!
---
As alliance, they send you there around lvl 15 but you can't get anything done.
---
At lvl 20 you can start doing quests, which leave you at like lvl 25-27 depending on how much shit you had to kill to get drops. Then you end up with like 2 to 3 quests which are lvl 28-30 which pretty much forces you to do stonetalon first and then comeback for them.
---
After that, you will sometimes be lvl 30 (more likely if you did BFD). And off to desolace you go.
---
Basically reddit in a nut shell, 90% of content to reach the subreddit front page is recycled lol
---
Mind vision has a max range I noticed the other day, it breaks if the target goes more than 40(?) yards from you
---
Increase the resist rate on slows / frost novas!
---
As a warrior, this would make me double happy for unrelated reasons that has nothing to do with only being able to /rude mages as they slowly decide how they are going to kill me.
---
He's also got to keep in mind that the lower dps arrows means he'll have to use more arrows per mob, meaning buying more cheaper arrows than the better ones.
---
Thanks, I'm new to healing to I'm still learning.
---
And single target, CC, PvP and defense
---
Oh...
---
&gt;None of us want the game to be changed or reset after sometime nor any upgrades to TBC or something else. We just want it to be classic and nothing more.
---
Speak for your god damned self dude.
---
I would totally make a Tauren Ret Paladin named Retbull, haha.
---
Just yesterday I (33 shaman) was fishing in Arathi, minding my own business, when a 35 gnome mage with half health runs up behind me and starts casting frost bolt at me. So I drop a grounding totem, purge his shield, run up to him, finishing off the rest of his health with one *very* lucky WF proc, and casually go back to fishing.
---
Still don't know what he was thinking trying to start a fight with me at half health...
---
Got it, thank you!
---
Phase 2 maybe just for honor, and to remove layering. Phase 3 they need to hold the fuck on with as battlegrounds will kill world pvp just like it did in 1.5.
---
This wasnt about gold though. Was about reaching lvl 40 im 60 hours.
---
Have they removed this now?
---
My voidwalker name on the server I play on most is kinda buns, it's Churkresh. My succ is Domela though which is pretty good imo.
---
It's not a shit show though, it's rather black and white. 75% think it's OK? -&gt; implement.
---
More than 25% are opposed? -&gt; discard.
---
Yes-voters whine for a couple days on reddit about how the novoters are wrong then everyone proceeds to carry on. It really is that simple.
---
So that's why backstab hits so hard.
---
I’m an upper evil enthusiast myself
---
No it's a reset.
---
The point of raiding isnt to complete it first. It's to continuously farm it to get your raid group geared for future raids. You want raid gear so you can go show off in pvp also. It's not a destination.
---
Don't forget balancing around arena
---
Yes, we can kinda of guess what spanish speakers are saying, but as you pointed, my english is better and I'm more confortable with that. Also, you would be surprised by the amount of Brazilians that know how to communicate well enough in english and that thinks the same way as me. We really don't do that well with spanish speakers.
---
And the other thing Blizzard didn't got right was that BR players outside Thalnos aren't playing on it especially to avoid spanish in open chat. Why would they transfer to a LATAM realm? lol
---
Besides all that, I don't think we Brazilians have enough players to maintain a good balance and high population in Classic.
---
Queues have nothing to do with layers.  Server cap doesn't change when they get removed.
---
Tribal.
---
When you check off the automatic self-cast, there should be an option nearby that lets you bind a key for self-cast.
---
It’s the healers job to heal. So heal dang it!
---
Ugh. That quest was a pain to finish. Low drop rate and so many players killing them. Same with the dragon whelps in Swamp of Sorrows.
---
Or setting up..for Sick wall jumps..
---
Rets were absolute terrors from the Wrath prepatch to ICC so...
---
you dont have to heal when the pack is dead
---
As far as I can tell, if the hunter knows what they're doing.
---
I played druid in vanilla so wasn't as aware of this matchup, but I've got a 26 Hunter in classic so far, and mages are really easy to take out 1v1 for me.
---
Most of us hunters are leveling Beast Mastery, which makes it even harder for you.
---
For non-BM spec you might have a chance by exploiting deadzone, but level 30+ BM have ways to remove poly and their pets can stun.

No, it's completely reset. This includes any rare recipes that might have been learned, too.
---
nameplate distance console command existed in vanilla as well so...
---
Leveled a hunter to 35 started a warlock and I’m enjoying that too. My main in vanilla was a rogue and then paladin/mage from BC on. If you have experience with either class I’d really appreciate your feedback as Im very much enjoying both. Will be focused on pvp
---
Fucking awesome so
---
Didn't learn from it. AFD as a very very right oriented party(some would say they are nazis) are getting more and more votes again. Hopefully history will not repeat itself.
---
Why can't it be a mix of Classic + and Classic Expansions? Hear me out.
---
The best part IMO of Classic is the sense of progression and feeling like you've earned a certain level. A lot of that struggle was removed later on in an attempt to catch up the newbies. Instead of just ditching the work they've done in retail Blizzard can just release the expansions but don't include things that allowed for new players to catch up. Instead make it basically a Hardcore version of the retail game. No character boosts, no heirloom gear. Don't allow players just starting an expansion the ability to buy gear and completely move past the need to run regular heroics. This way players that have invested the time and effort into multiple classes or raiding won't feel like their time investment was just disrespected in the effort to bring in more players. Those players can go to retail.
---
DON'T implement LFG or LFR. Instead all for an in game place where someone can post that they are interested in looking for a group for a dungeon or raid, but don't eliminate the need for players to have to interact and decide to group together. We can keep the 10/25 man raids, mythic dungeons because those are all just more ways to tackle content in a group of your preferred size.
---
basically.
---
Reddit is so fucken cringe holy fuck.

me not that kind of orc

Damn warrior quest. :(
---
Hunters seem rather rare on Fairbanks A then maybe warlocks or druids
---
Form no, weaving yes :)
---
It took them several years to take it from announcement to product. Just because all the visual assets were there doesn't mean that it was a cheap endeavor just to end after a single launch.
---
Aside from wikis that have class descriptions, you might post a thread asking what people love about their class. Then you can aggregate the info for him to read.
---
When I got started I read about the factions, races, and classes on a wiki site and I've never regretted making a Horde Undead Warlock for a second.

Dude you realize stats about naxx have nothing to do with its difficulty and everything to do with the time line of tbc coming out, right?
---
Also yes mc, bwl, aq are all below the level of lfr difficulty. Naxx is probably equal to a normal raid.
---
Pretty much everyone that gets 40 people into naxx is going to complete it.
---
I just use shift + W, D and F to switch stances and equip. Each has its own macro and just sits on my right side bar.
---
Wow that's really another level of taking the piss. Im cool with like a ten fifteen minute break during raids but holy shit.
---
Yeah its annoying as hell. I did SM Lib yesterday and the tank was flipping shit because we wernt aoein well enough and the run was taking to long (took maybe 30mins total). It wasnt meant to be an aoe run..it was just a normal run so I could get a staff (which I did!!) and the key. 
---
All of trade chat, lfg, and general chat (in SM) is just spams for mages and locks aoeing shit. Its an effeicent way to get gold and to level (with reliable group). But how is that enjoyable at all? Maybe doing it with 5 friends and switching up the instance could make it bearable but  going from 30-40 doing nothing but SM? Thats just boring.
---
unless you include suicide death to port to RH for speed running
---
Madseasonshow and punkrat both have vids online. I believe the punkrat one wAs shorter and easier to understand.
---
There are a hundred classic + threads a day. Go look at all of them, or go to the classic + subreddit.
---
Remaking the thread will not bring any more attention to it.
---
Ion: "This gameplay would have been enhanced by having the shaman travel through several different shards so that he never would have seen either the orc or the shaman again."
---
No because it would break CC
---
Way to misconstrue what I said for some sensationalist comment. If I ask a dps nicely to stop pulling so I can get proper aggro and then they start pulling everything just to be petty, I'm leaving. I've sat through 3hr dungeons just to not "be petty" and it definitely wasn't worth it. But enjoy your narrative, I guess.
---
I hate losing av. So ally it is. And a frend wants to play pally
---
Definitely.  We got a lot of dungeon nerfs in vanilla that we probably don't need with today's level of knowledge.
---
&gt; This is a discussion the community SHOULD be a part of. The community needs to keep asking and talking about what's to come
---
No it shouldn't.  "Developing via democracy" is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
---
1. Blizzard should never "add content" to Classic.  As soon as they do that, it is no longer Classic.  It is WoW 2 and Classic is gone.
---
2. Blizzard can release TBC/WotLK/etc but they *must* do it on separate servers.  Transfers are optional here, but it is imperative that people who want to play Classic forever be able to.
---
3. If Blizzard wants to release WoW 2, they can, but there is *no fucking reason* to tie it to Classic.
---
People who asking for Classic to be changed seriously lack vision.  Vanilla WoW should be available forever, unchanged.  That's the lesson here.
---
any recommended spots? and any tips? 
---
because last night I went to hillsbrad farms to give aoe farming a go, and while it did work, I feel as if I am not very good at it, often almost dying.
---
When you're in a bad mood, work on not spreading it onto others.
---
Good to hear a sensible war. There are a lot of cases where a tank would like a dps to chain pull with a dot or wand. It is much faster.
---
Unless they're complaining about it, don't sweat it, little tank.
---
I tanked five LIB runs yesterday, being about 2-3 levels below the DPS, and no one seemed to care. I asked them to let me get some threat on the two bosses, and that worked great. The trash was a free for all, and the runs were a success.
---
Take it easy, bro!
---
Nah, he is just patiently waiting his turn.
---
I don’t know why but I could really go for a coke and some waffles right about now.
---
So like 30s worth of food?
---
This was taken after my 4th Lord Menelas attempt, NE druid.
---
I didnt know frost shock did that much damage as enhance. Kinda fucking bonkers. Always thought it was a dank meme.
---
Hi, /u/xCYOx

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d3qxwu/i_just_hit_lvl_50_where_do_i_quest/). 
---
Shaka, when the walls fell.
---
It does not. It takes data directly out of the game
---
I'm a paladin myself, but I seriously love being a hybrid/utility class in this game. You feel so strong and useful, like a utility class should. If I make an alt, I'm definitely looking at Druid.
---
JFC I can't even see what you're trying to show me here.
---
Get your phone out and take an actual picture like an adult.
---
I think this is well explained because this is exactly how it is.
---
Respect! Grinding a warrior can be brutal at times. Any little thing helps!
---
As far as the Orc knows OP didn't do anything for them. They already escaped with the life by the time OP healed them, and it's unlikely they saw OP slay their tormentor.
---
also it doesnt seem to work on channeled spells
---
The attention to detail on this, how great the sound effects synchronize... 11/10
---
It goes to 11.
---
For Auctionator, run a full scan (under the Buy tab) when you visit the AH, at least once a day (but don't spam it). It will gather all the price data from the posted items.
---
Hey man I also got a voidwalker on biggles named Helthang. I was sad when I re rolled to another server and had to replace my thang with my current voidwalker.
---
Wow you make low level dungeon tanking seem difficult somehow
---
Tis a game, the rivalry is not to be taken so serious.
---
I think he's referring to the chunk of deleted comments.
---
Medium severs is perfect for a thriving community
---
I KNEW IT
---
(Okay, I didn't, but now I know and WE WILL MAKE THE CONSPIRACY KNOWN, BROTHER!)
---
Lol!  You win today's internet.
---
You just have to start them.
---
Honestly, good Hunters are a treasure that people hold onto.
---
dude I literally had the same exact thing happen to me. Met up with a rogue going by the name I knew him as. We were both in the same WC group. I hadn't seen him since TBC and it was so crazy the odds of that happening it was almost too much.
---
This goes for bind on equip, but questitems and dungeonitems are better matched
---
NSFW please
---
Form and weaving yes to shadow wand damage.
---
The world’s your oyster! Feel empowered to loot literally anything :)
---
You should out dps shit mages. Also that's pretty typical of horde, just swarm a single player cause you're all shit at pvp lmao
---
Maybe, idk. The whole "keep on to these items they will update" kinda thing is what they wanted to avoid which makes some sense.
---
Did you tell your "friend" they are worth 1500g?
---
&gt;  This change to shout may be enough to get it done.
---
Why would changing a warrior ability affect a group tactic that doesn't use a warrior?
---
Have you ever tanked as a druid? Powershifting for rage can save a group wipe from happening. It's vital
---
I mean, I can completely understand the view point. It's always a little disappointing to see others blaze by your progress because they have more time to play than you, but it's really a matter of priorities. If you chose to have a family/job instead of living with your parents and playing games all day, then that's what you chose to prioritize, and you can't be upset that someone else's priorities gave them more time or freedom to pursue their hobbies.
---
I'm pretty sure the guy who originally posted this trick was horde doing this to alliance.
---
No it's a tortoise in a shell.
---
Fair point! I joined midway through original vanilla and never experienced the early patches. Still kinda bummed that I don’t get to do the progression (items/talents/quests) true to the original.
---
If you come to the back cor er I've got one of the those 60 washes aerial packs reduced
---
Truly in my experience in vanilla and many different p servers, I prefer the types of people that are drawn to the Horde
---
4 warriors with ravagers and a shaman with a ravager go go
---
For tanking multiple targets as a warrior, am I best off spamming Demo Shout or rotating Sunder Armor through each target?
---
As someone who just finished lvl 300 in LW, I can honestly recommend you drop the profession and pick up like mining/herbalism. Currently I’ve lost easily 50g training LW and there is no benefit. I can buy all the craftable gear on the AH for near the same price as mats to make it myself. There is no BoP gear/benefit to training LW unless you are one of the first to max it and profit on recipes.
---
Engineering is another good alternative as you at least get some good/fun items to use from it.
---
It’s impossible that some content doesn’t invalidate old stuff, but it isn’t usually invalidated for a player advancing through the content. The stuff retail wow did was entirely remove even needing to progress through X.
---
I’m a kill people sitting at my inn
---
It was said by Gallywix in one of the pre-BFA shorts (or the book?), his pimp cane contained it and that's why it shines in [this cinematic](https://youtu.be/5T3ohHyceTA?t=102)
---
I immediately regret asking but thank you for the explanation.
---
Both are amazing at solo PvP and solo farming. Hunters are amazing fresh at 60 for both pve and PvP with garbage gear and warlocks are weak then, while with lots of good gear it becomes the opposite.
---
Either way, play the one you enjoy more, but if you intend to raid hardcore you might want warlock.
---
I was using WW at lvl 42 because at that time I didn't get an upgrade.
---
You can get more action bars in Interface options-&gt;ActionBars.
---
wait one freggin second.  is there a boat that takes you from darkshore to wetlands?
---
I just hit 35, but prior to that I had all three secondaries maxed to 225 and I just spent an hour last night getting to nat pagle to get the fishing quest that unlocks at 35 
---
How do y'all have to heal so little without hamstring kiting? Unless I'm fighting mobs that are at least 2 levels below me I still miss or get a considerable amount of autos parried, so for example leveling in stv killing those elder tigers I would get to about half hp from killing them even while kiting with hamstring, and if I don't kite I get to about 25% hp
---
Add-ons are core features, but they create new features from hidden API not normally accessible by the player.
---
Mage has cast time. Same for warlock.
---
Honor has DR when you kill the same person.
---
Off tanking is one thing, but as soon as a pull goes even slightly wrong and you've got no rage because the DPS have Leeroyed everything before you could hit it and Bloodrage is on cooldown, you're fucked.
---
Except you are ignoring that people were also bad at the game. If you hit 60 and dont clear all the raids it's a choice. You dont have to play much at all. My guild is raiding 1 night a week until phase 3. We will clear mc and ony in like 3 hours and then you free to not login till the next raid if you want. 3 hours a week is pretty light investment.
---
Well for one, mages have cast times on almost everything which give you a chance to interrupt and silence them when you get close.
---
Maybe its the same way we beat out lions, boars, and tigers in real life. Horde are dumb animals and humans are incredible endurance athletes? 
---
I mean a long spear and good aim beats mountains of muscles every time.
---
Blizzard does not make design decisions based on a couple people whining on Reddit
---
I totally agree with you. I do not play that way and will continue not to. But if you are openly harassing players and removing them from groups for not having the most optimized play style then you become a toxic player.   
---
Just from the nature of the knowledge known, those who had 10 years of Pserver experience are more likely to know these kinds of things than those who havent touched the game ever/ or in 12 + years.
---
Thanks for the repost.
---
Ha, I saw the same spider in burning steppes last night.
---
My point is, if you're making copper at the exchange of possibly losing silver, it's noto worth it.
---
Exactly! For me it was my first time building a computer, and that was the first zone I walked through that my bro-in-law (who'd walked me through the build process) pointed out how nice the ground textures looked and that I was getting really good FPS. Just a really nostalgic area for me, was super bummed when they flooded it.
---
But it didn’t stop them. And if they can’t stop themselves. Who the hell can?
---
No one brings this up but what if there was new raids with strictly cosmetic options. That way we could have new content but not change the gameplay.
---
You literally admitted you wouldn't feel the same way if you were the Hunter, meaning it's not about the philosophy at all, but alright guy.
---
I'm on Stalagg and the whole aoe thing is pretty noticeable, but it's been slowly calming down as the Retail tryhards hit 60.
---
Over the past few days I've been seeing people specify in their LFG post that it's a "normal" run or "non-aoe" run.
---
Drop enchanting - Get skinning for now. DEing is basically stealing gold from yourself until you're able to sell high end enchants
---
Really like this build, so you would keep this at 60 then and do raids in this too?
---
Yeah frost mages especially, we know your god mode and all the fanboys will be playing one, but your not the tank.  I needs rage, I needs to get hit in the face to get rage, you getting hit doesn’t give me rage.
---
The word "Cosplay" in the title didn't give it away..? lol
---
100% remember pulling with freezing trap and  sheep leveling through deadmines. 
---
Gnomer was considered hell on earth. 
---
SM was a wipe fest. 
---
And I love every single minute of it. It was harder back then for sure and it’s great
---
SMN and their 15mn rotation... ShB smoothed it out though.. a bit.
---
You all vastly over estimate how people enjoy the game. Hurr durr they’re not playing like it’s 2004, who the fuck cares back in the day the top progression guilds we’re doing crazy shit and the average show didn’t care, literally who are you to say what’s the right way to play
---
Who would want to live in a dog eat dog world? That’s horrible. I would rather live in a doggy dog world, thanks.

---
IDK which I was talking about in that post specifically but here's a couple I'll be trying in only 13 more levels!
---
Check out the AH for warmonger, it gives 3% hit. Its pretty nice and you can even use it while raiding.
---
Because anyone in melee range would kick your ass while you try to reload your weapon.
---
I could agree with abilities like Aimed Shot still firing if the Hunter started using it before the target got in the "deadzone".
---
...or even with the "deadzone" to be removed, but only if Hunters would 100% miss every shot they'd try to take for 3s after taking a melee hit, but I'm pretty sure you'd rather have the deadzone than an unreliable and easily-countered form of attack.
---
Honestly it wasn’t as bad as I expected, but not great. I made sure to stay away from PVP and it went pretty smoothly; about a quarter second delay overall.
---
They hotfixed nameplates because of this sub hating them and forums hating them, so I don't see your argument.
---
I'm not saying I want the 1.12 stats but out of all the stuff they've done, it's pretty reasonable
---
Yeah, but is it really still *Horde* pride when the leader of the Horde is who you're working against? Or is it more of a pride in what *could* be, or a new splinter group?
---
As a warlock, I agree. I'll straight up tell the healer not to waste their time healing me. If I do it to myself, then I'll handle it myself.
---
Mages have casts which are vulnerable to interrupts where as you can't interrupt most (if not all?) hunter shots.
---
Help! I'm stuck deciding a main. I have Druid 27 (feral and likely lifetime tank), hunter 26, mage 16, priest 15. I have a warrior as well but man it sucks solo. I'm happy with Druid tanking and I like tanking but worried I'm gimping myself for pvp as druid. Out of those classes and specs, what would you choose?
---
This is what everyone says, but I don't think y'all were there when OSRS came out. On release, the Jagex Dev team was memed on more than y'all meme on the WoW Dev team.  Everyone assumed they would be shit and put out RS3 (Equivalent of retail) like content, but they didn't.
---
Also, onlookers. Notice who’s throwing personal attacks and names around. Who’s toxic, people pvping on pvp servers, or people on reddit insulting others for playing the game how they want to?
---
10/10, would be her champion.
---
/unsheaths shitty wand
---
Really? They made nameplate adjustment due to feedback of Reddit and official forums.
---
AoE Frost Mages.  I remember leveling with them.  I remember it being a thrill, pulling huge groups of mobs, and carefully kiting them around, while dealing with those odd threats.
---
What other class builds offer that same kind of tension?  Basically, I want to PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT.
---
I'm **not** looking for the most *efficient* builds.  I'm looking for those builds that create that sense of heightened drama (usually by pulling many mobs as part of a viable strategy), where your victory or success hangs on the balance of a split-second decision.
---
AoE leveling is the only means I know of getting that thrill, but I'm listening for all and any experiences.
---
If what you say is what you really believe, why play today? It's all trash. You don't like the story, you don't like progression, you don't like gear and you only want the top 1% to see some of it. no fun. why waste time? We all know the story - we all played the strategy games - we all know the best content is yet to come.
---
You can't jump over dick in WoW.
---
Even in BFA raids things like DH jump and warrior leap are a massive gamble of whether you'll avoid damage of an ability you are visually jumping over and not getting hit by or not.
---
Alliance side I gave up on finding RFK groups when it was still relevant to me because it was impossible. People don't want to do anything but the cleave dungeons anymore :(
---
I just came back to laugh some more at his level he's missing out on primal fury to have furor LOL.  Next he'll be missing fff then hotw then lotp.  All of these are stronger than furor for tanking while leveling.  At no point in the leveling process is furor better than being 5 points deeper in feral.  Run away kid
---
Malfurion is cenarion circle, so he's a neutral party.
---
Can check when i get home But healbot Also lets you assign with a dropdown bar. That bar should contain downranks
---
If your going mage look up Aoe farming and some good spots to do it. You can make good money and get a fair few greens for disenchanting or selling on AH
---
Also note that you'd have to press it twice to change and then to charge
---
lol. put your own group together by directly whispering people. takes 5 minutes
---
pics or it didn't happen
---
It's hard without a pattern to follow, though. I actually have no idea how people design patterns. Like, how do you print it up?
---
I think you need to spend time off Reddit.
---
Hell yea! I just added some mage macros!
---
in end endgame you use a dualwied fury tank, kinda the same idea as 2h tank during leveling
---
Note tailoring is only useful for you now if you plan to get the archmage robe pattern. Bags are already dirt cheap and you won’t turn a profit on the skill.
---
I saw the exact moment the hunter knew he fucked up.
---
Uh oh, someone tell Poland /u/apostremo is stirring up the germans again.
---
I didn't see a bag drop at all until level 40, and then I got a Jouneyman's Backpack.
---
Ah i see, so if you want to be hardcore in both its a matter of grinding the money before the reset day -1?Thanks for commenting.
---
Yeah, I've been doing tailor/enchant as well (char level 22), but you definitely won't be making much profit off of those for gold. The thing is, I'm usually able to keep up my tailoring level to be making decent gear for myself, which I find satisfying, if not the most cost effective.
---
Farming mobs in your 30's for grays/mats will be a good gold maker once you're there.
---
Right. Keyboard turning is going to be significantly more prevalent amongst returning players that only got as far as TBC than retail players.       
---
        
---
Othering at its finest.
---
Maybe, the command I knew got patched today.
---
Pray they don't proc windfury lol.
---
I’ve got roughly 20g at lvl 29 from selling dungeon stuff and mats
---
it worked yesterday, but there was a small patch today and now i can't seem to get it going :( rip
---
Thinking about it myself.  The lack of queues sounds lovely as it's a nightly ritual at this point to try to log in early and hold a spot until my son goes to sleep.
---
The rain effects in this game are so comfy
---
https://youtu.be/gENVB6tjq_M
---
Cause I’m already in battle stance from the charge. Clap isn’t so much about big threat as it is A mitigation and B a weak amount of aoe threat such that I can take a heal without mobs running to the healer. It probably isn’t the most optimal, but then I’m obviously also not playing with optimal dps. 
---
I am instantly going from the +18 rage charge + white hit to tclap into def stance +white hit into either a revenge, sunder, shout or brage (so I can use a yellow ability). 
---
I was in a red “aoe” group last night. Doing the above, I’d lose one mob—typically the one I hadn’t tabbed to in time. I’d taunt, a nova would go out, and the pack would be dead before the nova broke.
---
Have you tried making friends and questing with them? It seems to be what the Horde is doing...
---
I'll have the spaghetti and meatballs.
---
I'm the idiot? Look at the title of your post you have no idea what you are even trying to say
---
Source?
---
There was a big thread debating healer opinion vs. lock opinion on life tap and what to expect from the healer. 
---
Apparently it's more heated than I thought.
---
I want tbc for arena, that’s where the real skill is.
---
Yep, I've got a nice little list going and I'm not going to hesitate kicking people if they're being assholes.
---
what lol
---
All of my non screw around alt toons have always and forever shall remain FOR THE HORDE!
---
Out of interest what was the bow and how does it compare to Venomstrike?
---
Lol, this is like when I'm too lazy to convert dnd's phb ranges and sizes and just switch feet for metres etc...
---
We _think_ what happened was that the entire server was deleted. A lot of people thought they got banned.
---
The best I can do for you is introduce you to our subreddit: /r/sulfuraspvp.
---
There's a few Discord links for you to choose from.
---
Probably Shadowfang Keep &amp; Stratholme. Scholomance is a close runner up.
---
I would gank you again 10/10 loving the tears
---
Did this post get deleted?
---
The best part is the OP wanting Blizzard to discipline the gankers.
---
You can't make this shit up lol!!!
---
Yea I don’t like it.
---
Only came around because they nerfed dungeons. Vanilla dungeons were not super easy, people aren’t better at min/maxing or better in general.
---
The patches leading up to 1.12 literally made the game very easy. So now people can abuse it.
---
It is what it is.
---
I hop back and forth from my warlock to my rogue. Different races, different continents, different professions, different gameplay. Nothing wrong with playing multiple characters to keep things interesting - it takes longer to hit 60, but you're not going to hit it at all if you burn yourself out playing a class that's starting to bore you.
---
I didn't break any rules as much as you wanted me to.
---
It's interesting seeing people like you get so upset over a discussion thread on something that might not even happen.
---
Cant wait to run UBRS again . It was my favorite back in the day .
---
I’m level 27
---
Luckily, we had a higher level guy with us that stopped everything and walked me through the whole tanking process.
---
It's the best dps pet in the game and the best pvp pet in the game.
---
Personally I will never camp spawns for 8 hours to find her. 
---
But it does make a non-insignificant difference in pvp and pve. It's like upgrading your bow, if you are better than your pvp target you will probably win even with a worse bow, but upgrading is never a bad idea.
---
Fuck. Yes. Horde ftw
---
xDDD  &lt;333, wow.
---
It's not though. There is a subreddit for classicplus discussion. This is a place for classic discussion. 
---
Some threads are cool to be posted here, but build off those. Dont open up repetitive unnecessary posts.
---
If it’s pisses you off so much then just ignore the discussion... Did this really deserve a new post?
---
That post also has over 5 thousand comments, it’s super condescending to call all of those users childish just because you don’t like the discussion, if any you’re the one acting like a child not being able to tune out what you don’t like.
---
Currently on Mankrik, if the realm info is to be believed. Rogues are our least played class by both Horde and Alliance.
---
What's this spellcleave that everyone is asking for in dungeon groups?
---
Definately not the classic I remeber. I rerolled to a priest so it doesn't bother me now. Gl to all the sol rogues trying  to find groups.
---
Theres a reason why retail is how it is. It's not all blizzards fault.
---
You grew up on a PvE realm eh? 
---
PvP realm rules = do not let the opposing faction become stronger. 
---
Yes, that means you fuck with red hunters when they're doing their demon quests. This is a must. Otherwise that hunter will only grow stronger and have an easier time one-shotting your cloth friends. By *not* fucking with them, you're just expediting the death of your own healers.
---
god this is my brother....
---
he wanted to stop playing like 4 days in because others had "beaten the game already".  
---
I basically said "stfu your level 25"
---
You do realize there are PvE servers, right? I'm with you man, I enjoy a little friendly PvP as much as the next guy when it's between two consenting and similarly leveled characters, but I also enjoy the leveling process and questing, and not power leveling to 60, and being able to choose when to engage in PvP, versus just getting slaughtered endlessly for the few hours a day i have to play. I learned very quickly on Pservers that there are far too many griefers out there to make trying to level up on a PvP realm anything but a nightmare.
---
Honestly, just make the jump to a PvE server, we'd love to have you over on Mankrik! Everyone gives PvEers shit and calls us 'casuals', damn right I'm fucking casual, comes with having a life that doesn't revolve around wow(as much as I'd love if it did). Do whatever is going to let you enjoy the game the most, and fuck what everyone else says.
---
God damn tell me about it, this just stinks of the fucking GO GO GO GET EVERYTHING ASAP mentality of retail.
---
Like, I'm not gonna tell anyone how to play the game but I am really disheartened by this...my suspicion is that these are the majority of people who will drop the game after reaching 60.
---
enchanting isn't worth it right now.  Drop it and get skinning. vendor sell everything you get.  Pick up enchanting at lvl 60 and farm greens in low level dungeons.
---
Loving the Contigo water bottle. Came in a 3 pack from Costco.  Has a nice wide mouth, so easy to drink from. The pop top does a good job and is easy to operate with just your thumb.
---
Let the tank pull for initial Aggro - they will be gratefull for that
---
So true!
---
So I have a few questions.
---
Warrior tanking: I never played warrior in Vanilla, but in Classic I rolled one. I originally spced into Prot and was leveling with a sword in shield until I was told I could tank as fury. I now have a sword and shield on standby but I really use my whirlwind axe.
---
Can I take with the axe? How do I tank like that?
---
Yesterday I did an SM run and they told me to not even go into a defensive stance but I could barely hold aggro, any tips is this normal? How do I tank as fury?
---
Also, do how efficient are SM runs. Maybe it was my dog shit tanking but for how long the run took it didn't seem to be super efficient, but now that I have the FP I feel like it'll be worth it.
---
How much EXP an hour is SM on average, and how long can I do it? Should I do this instead of questing?
---
Why?
---
Excuse me, how do change the color of people on the chat based on their class? I'd like to have that AddOn (hopefully you don't need an entire UI overhaul for that).
---

It was clearly a mistake. It should have read "You can hide your UI but why would you want to do that and you can take a screenshot by pulling your phone out of your pocket and using the camera on that." I thought that was pretty basic on reddit judging by the pictures I regularly see posted here.
---
All I can refer to is Kromcrush, we have about a 70:30 horde:alliance ratio
---
Clearly you didn’t read rule 7. Keep going, I have plenty of downvotes
---
Maraudon. Its like bigger Wailing Caverns, which is my second favorite.
---
I genuinely wish this subreddit would have more videos like this rather than everyone whining constantly about getting ganked or queue times.
---
Windows 10 has a built in gamebar with that functionality, but shadowplay is a lot more convenient (if only it didn't come with a 500MB buggy mess that is GFE).
---
Broken tooth has an extra attack every 6 seconds compared to a 1.2 attack speed pet. Therefore he Interupts casters more in Pvp. In group pvp it makes little difference (assuming you focus target togather). It can make a huge difference in duels and though (assuming you are fighting casters)..
---
So you want Blizzard to make CHANGES to Classic?
---
Uninformed nonsense
---
Problem was most of my new found friends were on Zandalar tribe, I wouldn't want to let that server go if I stayed, it was great for World PVP and socializing, SivHD and Nixxiom did great events on the server.
---
Please stop trying to control discussion of classic wow in a subreddit where we discuss classic wow. People can discuss what they want, you and your friend's levels don't make any difference.
---
I see nothing wrong with this. I don't play retail anymore so I don't post in /r/wow anymore. Simple as that. 
---
/r/2007scape subscribers manage to not infest /r/runescape, I don't know why we all can't do the same thing.
---
How would you go about doing it yourself then
---
OP literally said he was thinking of mankrik...
---
Skeram Horde, 59 lock, never gotten an outright whisper to join a dungeon group. Get whispers for random zone summons all the time though for gold.
---
Huh? None of what I said is in the game. It's all classic right now. I'm not sure I understand your question. 
---
&gt; we all know the best content is yet to come.
---
I and a lot of this subreddit would very much disagree.
---
This was on Earthfury a few days ago. Guy posted about fishing being sacred in the server discord. Sorry not sorry
---
The Scarlet Crusade did a little purging.
---
You can switch weapons mid combat. If you frequently fish, you should either have an addon to quickly switch from fishing rod to weapon or just have your both on a quickbar.
---
Why roll on a pvp server and bitch about getting ganked lol
---
Its like me going to Burger King and complain about how they dont offer Steak or Soups.
---
&gt; I hope blizzard add some form of punishment for that stuff
---
I hope blizzard bans you from every single pvp realm so you can go do your pve stuff on a pve server you little baby
---
What lol druids can do 60 5 mans absolutely fine
---
Discussion

RIP Mitch
---
Tailor/Enchant here, level 45... luckily I'm a Warlock so yay free mount.
---
I'm pretty sure /u/ResQ_ is talking about the idea that there'd be "season" servers where you can start fresh, but that your existing characters would remain as is.
---
So... nothing would be reset. A fresh start server wouldn't have anything to do with an existing character.
---
Okay, what's your point?
---
I've been away from WoW for quite some time, what is the best website to use for addons?   Looking to get a couple small add-ons but cant remember what website people used for the life of me
---
What an asshole, jeez
---
congrats
---
Anyone can do it. You just play the game and press your buttons.
---
I'm doing exactly this. Mobile hotspot from the cell phone just to maintain internet connection with the game server while I queue.  Once I get home I'll jump on my desktop and my home network.
---
Actually in the timeline that classic wow supposedly takes place in, vc is 30 years dead already
---
The channel still exists, and being able to tune in and out of a global lfg is nice, wish more PPL used it
---
An alternate storyline would be very welcome
---
Turn off party invites in the settings
---
Yep. If someone is a shit player, they're going to go on being shit and stressing everyone else unless they learn.
---
Why does everyone roll warrior, BG'S are gonna be really fun for me at this rate.
---
Nah usually they learn their lesson, it's a teaching moment!
---
I might be a little concerned, mainly with other players interactions with your 6 year old. I’m sure you will be right there with him though.
---
I'm fucking idiot too
---
Since I will never read that book, how is it explained? I'm genuinely curious, but between my altitus and real life obligations will never have the time to read the book.
---
My allegiance has always laid with Azeroth, as in the planet itself.  All my toons are Horde, and always will be, but my top allegiance is to our home world. Thrall shares that vision, so I'll always back him, but I've always found myself more attracted to factions like the Earthen Ring and the Cenarion Circle much more than any Horde politics.
---
Bet you farmed mad lowbies tho.
---
Honestly I thought he aggrod when you pull Mograine if you don't kill him first. I've never not killed him.
---
If I were to come back and it's not got any punishment system I would go PVE, since by then my friends wouldn't remember me I guess.
---
I'd probably be okay with that.
---
Honestly, the "Classic Expansions" idea is probably the best.
---
Have servers that are dedicated to a specific expansion, and allow players to transfer to a new server whenever they're ready for a new experience.   That means that players could stop at whatever their favorite expansion was, and play that forever if they wanted.
---
Not sure the prices in classic, but moon cloth use to be profitable as a tailor. It's on a 4 day cool down or something so not something you can spam.
---
Yeah that's what I always get, let me just run slowly back to the last room...
---
https://i.imgur.com/b9RzbuQ.png
---
You are right but it's still helpful if you are running with a spell cleave and aggro doesn't really matter
---
I wouldn’t mind something similar to keystones for higher level dungeons. With the exception that you get to choose the difficulty instead of having to upgrade the key.
---
Doing the alliance druid quest about curing stuff, looking to get earth root. Where do I find it? I've wandered around teldrassil and darkshore and found nothing, am I just blind?
---
I get going after a certain piece of gear (or several). I plan on doing a few runs to get caught up on silk cloth for tailoring. 
---
I have no problem with people spam running dungeons, its just annoying to have them spamming all channels looking for only two classes to run the same dungeon 10 times over. Then having the people in those group get pissy when you skipped certain spells because now their run is 5 mins longer than it would have been had you gotten those spells.
---
Both hunter and mage requires a reliably way to reset dungeon, but honestly if you are in a somewhat active guild you can probably find acouple guys who will just accept invite when you do it and then reset when you are offline.
---
Hunter we are 100% sure will be able to farm 120ish gold per hour which is absolutely incredibly.
---
Mages we simply do not know enough about how good their DME and stuff will be. We know ZG will be good gold but that's for a short time and very difficult to do, and gear is very helpful there.
---
I'd go hunter.
---
/r/classicwowplus is a place for people who are already on board with the idea. I want opinions and ideas for people who are on the fence or hear from the people who are against it, which you clearly are. Yes, classic + is still a part of /r/classicwow whether you like it or not. It's not in the rules to not discuss it.
---
AoE dungeon grinding.
---
Eh, repeatable content is okay but it's the rewards that determine whether or not I hate them. I'd prefer an option to binge on weekends instead of playing every day (something like emissaries) but the daily quest itself isn't the problem. 
---
Do a repeatable quest 150 times and get a rare mount is cool...I can always just not do it and people with the mount obviously earned it. It was pretty bad for inflation but repeatable stuff for gold/mats is reasonable too. I don't mind dailies as part of rep grinds either (as long as it's just a part).
---
The problem is you can't be using dopamine and addiction to keep people logging in and you can't 'punish' people for missing a day (I say 'punish' in quotes because most of the time it's all in the player's head but that is their intention). If I know I need 120 more daily quests, I can take off a week and get the cosmetic mount a week later. If I'm chasing a .001% drop rate item, any day I miss is a chance I won't even get it this expansion. Even worse, if I get the item it won't be an achievement. Someone who thinks the mount is ugly got it on launch day.
---
Warlocks are great, they can summon my ass!
---
I was heavily thinking about it. I just barely have time with my main y'know?
---
This is exactly what I decided to do last night after disenchanting my evenings drops and then spending half my silver on spell training.
---
I had a run at Wailing Caverns, it was dope. My first run, as a druid off healing and off tanking, that end murlock was brutal to our party, but we did it. Warrior died in a sec, and i had to tank as bear, but we made it.
---
I do still play retail though =/
---
Thank you! I'm gonna look into making a macro to mark.
---
Shitpost Sunday.
---
which addon will allow me to move it?
---
I dont think in the 15 years I've played this game that I've ever been pressured to do anything.
---
This seems more like a personality trait with you OP than an actual issue. So a personal issue. Get good.
---
Because resetting character levels is wasting all the time and work people have put into it.
---
And many people don't enjoy the leveling process (me being one) and don't want to go through it again, and again - so you'd (Activision) lose subscriptions and money.
---
Notice the key word "how" isnt there. Makes a huge difference.
---
If a quest requires me to right click, and I dont know that, its not because I dont know HOW to right click. Its because I dont know I need to ight click.
---
The firestone reads spell damage and other effects, thats why i asked. Thank you!
---
Do I need 5/5 in Increased Tooltip for raiding?
---
My joke might be lost if you're on a PvE server, but on PvP it is almost impossible to read any of the quest text at Nessingwary's Camp because it is a constant battleground.
---
Yeah I am not running that with Shamans as a tank.
---
Switch to Horde?
---
People keep saying this but that’s because there was no official classic. Now that there is private servers are essentially done for except for those that don’t want to pay for a sub or if they crest expansion private servers.
---
Hmm definitely going to check that out, thx!
---
Always uncheck that, like to run lean and mean.
---
I see WoW being Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK. WoW 2 is Cata and beyond, after the graphics and leveling changes introduced in that game. Talents changed the most post Cata, with the system being entirely changed. Cata was the start of the "New World of Warcraft".
---
YES!  
---
also, idk how to explain this but the Train in the raid was so cool, like it makes you feel like you are in a huge place.
---
Yup wtf
---
Cell phones weren't as big in classic.
---
Noobs would literally have to copy their screens four pictures. Basically it's like living in the 19th century before technology.
---
Oh defo not her then, she is lvl 47, it did seem quite out of character. 
---
I hope this Chimm is ganked profusely.
---
I mean, I played about 12 ish years ago when I was a lot younger, I'm not gonna commit to anything I remember being actually correct.
---
Where does one get so many quests from around that level?
---
You should be able to get it back by reloading the UI. There should be a button for that in the settings
---
I use Classic Codex and it shows the quest level. There is also QuestLogEX which extends the quest log to be bigger. It may also add the quest level.
---
Yeah, unfortunately for the last year or so he's been making content for 7 year olds. When was the last time he even put out a Dunk view, or just any video that wasn't xD rAnDom humor and let's player noises?
---
I'm also thinking even BC could affect spells, too when we cross that road.
---
link the census?
---
I'm 29
---
Well German spells only trade at .90 the value of American spells.
---
listen man, if i didnt specifically ask, your poopy buff is honestly not worth the physical effort of lifting up my right hand off my mouse
---
I feel you, the metric system is almost as good as that EU MMO everyone is playing.
---
Nah they're worth like nothing on my server
---
i'm farming firepotion mats for even BIGGER moneyyyyyy
---
just hit 41 no mount feelsbadman
---
This is why I rolled on an RPPVP server. Players here aren't focused so much on the meta and minimizing dungeon times. People here just want to enjoy the game.
---
PvP doesn't steal that much time away from leveling and it's usually a welcome break from questing/grinding.
---
Did you play in vanilla? Was like it back than with T2 rogues in redridge what makes it different now? Go play PvE punishing the masses for afew players in PvP is a horrible horrible horrible idea.
---
Hunter was trying more to kite him, I think. Note the Serpent Sting (dot) and Concussive Shots (slow). The problem was that it backfired, because he still had Aspect of the Cheetah (dazed when attacked) and the Shaman has Lightning Shield (thorns effect, which then causes Cheetah to daze).
---
Kiting doesn't work so well when Shaman has +30% speed without the daze (ghost wolf) and Earthbind totem for when he stands up and in Hunter's dead zone. Now the Hunter's dazed and ensnared, and the Shaman comes into melee range for a Windfury proc.
---
TBF, this would have been far less entertaining had the RNG not worked in the OP's favor like it did.
---
Level 45 here, only bags I saw were Journeyman's from the finsl chest in Uldaman, and from an elite ogre in STV
---
It looked at the other comments. One guy is discussing, the other 95% are saying this is a repost and isn’t needed here.
---
Expansions, that we can upload our current character to. But leaving a the previous game unchanged.
---
That's exactly the point, I don't want a new server, just a populated one. Creating this new one Blizzard is splitting the population in half.
---
Like I commented earlier I doubt this person has any connection to the streamer, please don't send this streamer any bad links.
---
its a character in wow, art and cosplay shit should go to /r/wow
---
It doesnt ignore it at all.  It celebrates it.  Having such exclusive endgame content is absolutely healthy for an MMO and creates a sense of mystique about the world that would otherwise be missing.
---
For example,  I remember as a kid feeling extremely proud of my few pieces of BWL gear and my razzashi raptor mount.  I was the coolest one of all my IRL friends that played the game.  However,  whenever I would see my server's Scarab Lord, or a guy with the Winterspring frostsaber, or a guy fully decked out in 9/9 t3,  I would be filled with a sense of wonder at all the things in the game I had yet to see,  and a desire to continue playing to perhaps one day earn my place as one of my server's top players.  It made the game world feel much bigger,  like there was always something more that could be conquered.
---
This above all else is what is missing from retail and modern MMOs.  The biggest sin of WOTLK was creating so many different difficulties that it allowed people who had not put in the time to see all of the boss encounters in dumbed down forms, and in doing so paved the way for the future of the game degrading into what it is today.  It cheapened the experience of downing endgame bosses and destroyed that sense of wonder about the world and raid encounters that was present in vanilla and TBC. 
---
MMOs dont have to be a full time job to be enjoyed,  but the very best rewards and experiences should absolutely be reserved for those who do put in as much time as a full time job.
---
&gt;  I don't know if it's 1.12 talents or other changes but the content at 60 is laughable easy. 
---
That's exactly what it is. 1.12 is balanced for AQ and Naxx raiding, not leveling. That's why all the original content seems really easy. Lot's of changes occured to boost heals and AOE since 1.0 and 1.12. 
---
This is why everyone's bitching that the raids are too easy, but that's because they (MC and Ony) were balanced for different talents/values. Hell half the BIS gear for raiding from level 60 dungeons wasn't even in the game until much later on so there is a huge difference between launch 1.0 balancing and 1.12 balancing.
---
Look up Towlie's paladin tank video on YouTube. He goes over talents and his gear. You'll mainly want strength for attack power. Agility is also good.
---
Gtfo with that cosplay here. /r/wow pls.
---
You can barely get to 30 with only quests, as evidenced by OP.
---
I know lol. It's terrible.  I'm assuming he provoked me somehow for me to reply like that. Also, I'm assuming I was drunk as I often was back then.
---
No need to be nervous, if he tagged it just could have stood there and watch him die then it's yours...lol
---
That sucks man. I haven’t had anyone bitch me out, but I’ve definitely missed out on the whole “wow the community is so wonderful and friendly” aspect of the first few weeks. 
---
Mob/node tagging means fighting over mobs, aggro dumping onto other toons, blatantly not helping and healing people who get into trouble. I got called out in chat once for tagging a mob that was literally about to kill a guy. He had no health or mana, so it wasn’t a looks worse than it is situation, he was gunna die. Sorry for helping. 
---
I don’t expect people to hold each other’s hands, but I’ve just seen so many people being nasty.
---
You don’t get banned from that, that’s not how the automated system works, it only works if multiple people report him.
---
Twitch
---
There's a setting that records all vod. then you can use the clip and highlight tool to create content.
---
You'll have to set up a streaming software to get it going though.
---
What is this? Crybabyhausen? Just ignore and move on.... honestly if that is all it needs, then you shouldn't be playing online at all. 
---
Please grow up
---
Well, there aren't any battlegrounds atm, so you can twink yourself out at 19, but your only option is looking sweet at the bank, or getting smacked around by folks 20-30 levels higher than you.
---
But where is the &lt;Print button?
---
If you're having issues with limited bag space, it's also worth getting a tailor to make you some [Small Silk Packs](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4245/small-silk-pack).
---
Mage food is pretty trash at a lot of levels, I always buy vendor food even if I've got a mage in group.
---
Well then that's her problem not yours
---
Que?
---
Congrats dude its 5 dollars with gamepass. I hope it's a lot of fun.
---
Charlie the Unicorn in Azuna might be my favorite.
---
It's still early. A majority of players have better things to do than gank. As more people get close to 60 and begin the endgame grind, it's only going to get worse for lowbies. Maybe this isn't the game for you. /shrug
---
I made the mistake of putting the game on my NVMe SSD. Haven't been able to read a loading tip yet.
---
That's not at all what I said though.   
---
Why do you have to put words in my mouth?
---
I'd like to see Classic but with a few QoL upgrades (dual spec FUCKING PLEASE), and eventually branch out into BC and WotLK. Probably not Cataclysm and MoP, even though I really enjoyed both.
---
I picked herbalism instead of skining because if I ever get to end game raiding I can farm my own herbs for pots/flasks, and to make some gold selling those herbs on AH.
---
As for tailor, same as you, robe of archmage and zg set after, with free bags on the way. Leveling tailor just by crafting them. It might not be the most efficient way mats-wise, but atleast I don't craft white-stat-less items to vendor, I'm making some money on the way, and ocasionaly craft some piece of gear that's an upgrade to the ones I have. Trained 0 stuff apart from bolts/bags and said pieces so far.
---
Naw I love the alliance cities too much
---
its goin further so it has more time to warm up... so it hits softer
---
They are different for sure, I wouldn’t say very different though. Void walker is basically the same, and that’s what you use most of the time while leveling.
---
&gt; mid evil
---
I agree, kind of breaks immersion to watch someone disappear as soon as they get 30yds away. Would be nice to be able to see someone get smaller and smaller.
---
Which also makes me think—- most of the zones have a fog so you can’t see very far even on max settings. Let me see to tanaris from orgrimmar I have a 2080!!
---
So it sounds like there was no actual problem before your healer created a problem by deciding not to heal him. Because you can just charge in alongside him and just play the game and everything is fine.
---
I almost never get tips. One time it was 69c. Today someone asked me to make them food and water, and once they had it (no tips), used /lick on me and mildly sexually harassed me for a while in whispers. One of the downsides of rolling a female character I guess.
---
Not my proudest fap...
---
It would group players together by expansion, but they should each be able to have at least 5 healthy servers to pick from.   I don't think this would fragment the community any more than it already is.  For example, people currently say "Oh yeah, I play over on Thunderfury" etc.   The only change is they would say "Oh yeah, I play Burning Crusade over on Bigglesworth", etc.
---
Gotta be a premium subscriber for that
---
You could ignore him immediately and forget he even exists
---
I got one too. This is my first time playing WoW, I didn’t realize my luck at the time. Space is hard to come by.
---
Shaman are definitely not great farmers. They only thing they excel at is herbalism because ghost wolf.
---
It's a combination of two common but vulgar words for female and male genetalia. It doesn't make that much sense in Swedish wither and just sounds rude.
---
You're actually braindead.  I told you what you're missing out on and what you're missing is so blatantly better than furor I didn't think anyone would be dumb enough to claim othereise.
---
You think furor is better than primal fury+free ap, or fff, or hotw, or lotp?  Which one do you think furor is better rtham and I'll trash you more specifically but since you've made 0 points and just cried like a victim I doubt you have any points at all.  Please be stupid enough to say furor is better than the mentioned talents and why.  Please?  Alternatively run away kid.
---
I always went with the 1.3 speed durotar Tiger. You get them super early and .1s isn’t worth the camping and broken tooth is going to be even worse.
---
When I played in BC scorps had highest PvE DPS. Boars have a charge which is decent. Like someone else said hunters already dump on casters outside of 1% of elite frost mages than can deadzone
---
30 feral 21 resto
---
You'll thank me later
---
man you show up in almost all the subs i visit
---
Mods if I'm supposed to blur names just remove the post, since it was a level 1 throwaway character I didn't give it any thought.
---
I used to do the same. It was certainly patched. Which patch however I cannot say for certain.
---
Because they are literally making your job harder, and making the healers job harder and slowing down the run. I will still tank it but if they are doing it constantly I'll let them die.
---
Thx
---
You literally responded to me first. This is **MY THREAD**. You won man, you have the power and control over me. Congrats?
---
That's like your opinion, man.
---
I'd prefer them to release classic, then tbc, and wotlk under a similar time structure. But with minor balance tuning. Others are not for this. But to say I want classic forever would be boring. I'd clear the content then quite after a bit, just like I would have back in the day.
---
&gt; or they are finally generating more threat.
---
It's totally that. I've got some talent points I will be spending soon, that will make my rage production much less dependent on things attacking me, which will in turn, allow me to make them attack me more. Which in turn will give me more threat.... it's a feedback loop.
---
Currently if the pull goes well, and I start with agro, and things wail on me, and I maintain rage, I have 0 problems holding onto that agro. But if the DPS strips 1 or 2 mobs off me, and I'm not generating rage, and I'm spending what little rage I do have pealing runaways off the healer or the mage etc the feedback loop goes the other way. 
---
By lvl 36 or so I should have *most* of my required tanking abilities and my threat generation will be a lot better. But then again, the DPS will have a lot more of their key abilities, so they'll be hitting harder, and the fight mechanics will get more difficult.
---
It was obviously a kid trying to be edgy. I just reported and moved on with my life but I wanted to see if he would get suspended but he didn't or rather hasn't at least.
---
Heirlooms once Naxx is on farm. That way people can level a bit faster and catch up since Classic has no level boost or anything.
---
My old classic Twink could take down the lvl 40 guards at crossroads...I think you underestimate the power of twinks
---
Jewelcrafting and Inscription (WotLK launch) were both amazing and would've fit in very well with Classic. 
---
I'm hoping this after Naxxramas, leads to a new "timeline".
---
make macro's for your main abilities with /startattack, for example..
---
#showtooptip heroic strike
---
/cast heroic strike
---
I play a warrior and I charge + hamstring mobs all the time to run "faster".
---
I would never dare attempt this on  a player though...
---
Heh, I upvoted that comment &lt;3
---
I’m on bigglesworth, I can attest to the ganking, but more often than not, I find myself with 4 other ally and we pulverize the horde
---
I’m trying to avoid stv for as long as possible by farming all tiers of SM
---
I’m not overlooking it. There’s no justification for lashing out and ‘punishing’ a teammate. 
---
Your mentality is an incredibly immature one. 
---
Like a kid justifying hitting another kid because they’re angry and upset. 
---
No. You don’t hit just because you’re angry. I don’t care how mad they made you, you do not hit. 
---
Now, if you’re not having fun playing with someone, absolutely feel free to leave the game. 
---
But if you kick the ball over the fence before leaving, you’re just being a crybaby. You’re upset and you want revenge. If you got super stressed and this is your coping mechanism, you need to take a break from the game or see a therapist or something.
---
That spec is trash lol
---
You'll end up using the 2 points in blackout, just leave it be grind out 2 levels you'll be fine.
---
ACKCHYUALLY spells scale with level in Classic too
---
I agree, it does look a little weird and very heavy for the poor horse but I do think all other aspects of an orc warlock makes it worth it! Nothing looks more cool in good set gear imo.
---
Yep, Old Blanchy’s world chat has a password on it.
---
You also have to figure in that you're getting XP and gold faster by using the higher dmg arrows. Go with the Jagged Arrows. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
---
I've had the opposite experience. People seem to love me water. I give it out so much that people have yelled at me for not selling it but tbh I get tips every other trade, though I've never asked for any.
---
Running towards the tank I key. I haven’t tanked in classic yet, but even in retail its something people need to learn. Although it isn’t a massive problem there because I play Demon Hunter and have insane mobility to scoop up a mob someone accidentally pulled mid fight. 
---
But it always feels like people’s reaction is the opposite of what would save them, they run away from the tank
---
Because people don't like being pidgeonholed into only healing at 60 by people who still are stuck on the notion that druids can only heal.
---
Damn gummy bears.
---
Andorhal?
---
Yeah, there's way too many trigger-happy DPS that just go full ham the second mobs aggro to you. Hey. Dinguses. This isn't retail, tanks can't just push 1 button and get infinite threat on everything in a 5 mile radius.
---
I tried really hard to get the name Irwin on a hunter on 2 server's butsadly no dice. I just wanted name my crocolisk Steve so it would say 
---
          Steve
---
      &lt;Irwin's pet&gt; 
---
On mouseover.
---
No solo BoEs above green. Did witness a Staff of Jordan drop in Cath tho. Only lvl 47, but have been pretty lucky with dungeon BoPs, so far. Especially weapons. Snagged Cruel Barb right at 19, then Strike of the Hydra on day 2 at 23 (lol) both on first run. Then also got The Rockpounder on my first Archaedas kill in Ulda. 
---
So pretty decent so far. I'm the only one in my friend group to not get a BoE yet, so I'm waiting for that Krol Blade to show up this weekend!

I agree, though I am a bit forgiving with Cata in that it felt like they did try in that xpac but missed the mark.  Wrath was enjoyable though not my favorite, personally I didn't really get on with the Northrend setting compared to Outland (as a Canadian, grim cold environments bring back PTSD triggering from collective years of plowing snow and frostbite) and the art style was a bit more bland, though it's nice that they didn't have the clown outfits that TBC levelling gear had.  Unfortunately that was the start of the LFG tool which morphed into the LFR nightmare from Cata onwards
---
Gosh, you're not kidding about the daggers. Editing those in.
---
It doesn't take four hours to get anywhere.
---
Are u okay? U look little green.
---
Sadly, people can’t control themselves here and insist on bringing up and pissing on retail for whatever reason. Incapable of just enjoying and talking about the specific game this sub was made for.
---
I aint helpin noone with my 6g.

This post is spot on. Most of the people on this thread agreeing with the OP are people who browse Reddit all day but barely play WoW for half a day. They are never going to reach 60 and have zero idea on what growing Classic WoW and keeping a stable, happy player base requires.
---
why do you feel the need to keep replying to something you said you have already written off m8?
---
The game didn't change much in that regard, but the majority of players sure did. In BC I remember clearing packs in heroic Shattered Halls as a rogue + mage duo, which I think was one of the hardest 5man dungeon back then. The game allowed this in vanilla as much as BC, its a proof of the usefulness of CC and marking mobs, it doesn't mean the game is meant for being AOEd.
---
Most of the time the "vanilla way" aka pulling, marking and CC is still the best way to play. Not because the mage will get oneshot if you don't, but because it's way more efficient. Any dps can facetank an elite for a while in Classic because healers and tanks may have the reactivity to save their ass whereas 15 years ago it was rarely the case, resulting in dps dying when they got aggro off the tank.
---
So while we are not being punished like we were before, healers will get OOM or the tank will get behind on aggro if they have to save dps's asses every fight. Shitty AOE runs and chaotic pulls result in :
---
* Potions used
---
* Large down times (casters always OOM and mages need to conjure way too much water)
---
* Wipes and corpse runs
---
* Repair costs (especially for tanks)
---
With the "vanilla way", you have barely any downtime/wipes, and clearing the dungeon is such a breeze it's actually often quicker then a so called aoe rush, while encouraging communication and teamplay.
---
I just don't understand the lengths some players are willing to take to avoid communication, quests, playing carefully or just making any effort at all. Why are they even playing classic in the first place?
---
Basically pick a tree and go with it. Fire is best for single target dps, recommended for questing. Frost is best for survival/aoe grinding, recommended for end game raiding and aoe leveling/farming. Arcane is a bit of a hodgepodge. It has some niche uses in raiding and often frost/fire mages will spend a few points in arcane for some of the mana efficiency it offers
---
This exactly. I hate just sitting around or going slow. When I play by myself and group up with others for quests their is no downtime, no deaths (unless I fuck up), everything is on me and I can move at my pace.
---
We don’t take the sport seriously 😝
---
Warrior with a Pocket Healer is the most OP combo in BGs. 
---
I think BGs come in Phase 2?
---
How does this ruin you having a great time? Making people bitch and moan is one of the best parts of MMOs.
---
When I tried to do this one day a rogue in another group pulled half of the whole castle, brought them to us, and vanished so they agroed all to us 😤
---
All it took was one reddit post for me to decide I don't like you lol. That's a record
---
"Layering was done horribly. They knew they had to put a CD on layering but didn't which was abused heavily for weeks."
---
i think were just going onto week 4. the layering was fixed near the end of week 2. the abuse was not nearly as widespread as people were lead to believe, and the few that did abuse it are banned.
---
"Server release was awful. By releasing a few servers at the start they doomed those servers to be overpopulated, and even a brainless monkey could've predicted that 2 EU ENG pvp servers wasn't enough. Now there's like 16 of them. Only 4 was out long enough in advance for guilds to decide to go on them, and those servers are now massively overpopped because blizzard heavily underestimated the pop."
---
this is 100% the fault of the players themselves, and needing to be on "the best server". even now when they can switch for free they wont do it.
---
"Dungeon grinding was kept in the game despite it not belonging there. Raid dungeon farming was bugged and gave ridicules exp which was exploited for world first mc/onyxia"
---
back in vanilla i leveled by mostly dungeon grinding because i didnt like questing. this time it is the opposite and i only do dungeons for the quests but thats what im liking. who cares how others play. the raid xp was fixed, and for the few that managed to abuse it, OH NO they got thru 30-40 kinda quicker than usual.
---
"The beta test was an awful sellout move that didn't improve the game only advertised it and starved players of the game experience making it less enjoyable when it actually came out as people had watched beta clips."
---
this is pointless to bring up and pointless to respond to.
---
"The phase system is awful and completely takes away from the blizzlike patch progression. They could literally just have kept blizzlike patches and it would be perfect."
---
only thing i can slightly agree on, but for opposite reasons. id prefer only the end game raid dungeons were gated, however, i dont even raid as im a pvper.
---
"The itemization is scuffed as hell. There's absolutely no reason for 1.4 items to be in the game from launch, and there's no reason for bindings to arbitrary be released into the game from phase 1 when they were introduced with BWL and they can literally not even be used to make thunderfury before the release of BWL. The 1.12 stats is understandable since it clarifies the stats of gear but the rest is inexcusable."
---
i dont know enough about the games itemization to comment on this, but maybe they could have increased the difficulty in raids, idk, idc really.
---
im thinking yous just a wittle bitch.
---
When someone snubs you for the named quest mob kill......... aggro as many mobs in the area as you can..... run towards the player who snubbed you while they are fighting a mob.......... make sure the mobs you aggrod are within a few yards of that player......... then run and break combat or die.  Congrats on creating a mob train that will kill the guy who snubbed you!
---
I've had good luck with the fire whelp pet farming in wetlands. The drop rate is low (like 1/1000) but if you can 1 or 2-shot the mobs it goes super fast. In 4 hours of farming them I found 2 of the pets which sell for 30-70g each depending on your server. I sold both of mine for 50g each so I essentially paid for my level 40 mount in 4 hours.
---
No, if you pull aggro right off the bat without me even touching the mob first, you're now responsible for it. Ahem HUNTERS. You've got a pet you clearly want to off-tank with, so go ahead
---
I honestly enjoy the Whirlwind warrior chain. The fight on the island is always a close call at lvl 30 if you're solo
---
Yep. Every post like this I say "play the game, press your buttons, do your job" and I usually get downvoted.
---
I'm not a good visual planner like that. Every time I've made a Halloween costume, I've needed to pour through those pattern books they have at Joann Fabric's and find something close to what I'm going for.
---
I suppose not everyone has that problem, though.
---
Youre a mad man all the way to 40 ???!!!  Did it till 35 and i got a decent amount of thhe way but damn thats dedication and a lot of fucking turtles
---
Except warriors and paladins aren't even close to being immune to crushing blows either in vanilla. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Sorry to hear that :/
---
I've done it 3 times now and Archadeus has dropped the ring every time. Super frustrating considering he has 2 weapons on his loot table. Also, the experience is pretty low. 5 bars for a full clear just doesn't seem worth it.
---
What lvl do I need to be to get a mount and how much is the cheapest one? I'm alliance rogue if that matters
---
Weapon dps doesn’t matter to you in form 
---
Which is why the manual cloud pummeler (from gnommeregan) is cat druids bis weapon for raids
---
If you are tanking right, the healer will have literally zero mana issues chain-pulling 1 packs.
---
That's because servers don't recognize you being "in the air".. Example: you warrior leap from point A to point B. For server you are standing on point A until the leap animation finishes and then you are on point B. If anything hits point A before the animation finishes you get hit. That's also why it's stupid to regular spacebar jump out of raid mechanics
---
someone in my party opened a trade to me at the beginning of Gnomeragon the other day or something. I put a stack of conjured water in there and they cancelled the trade on me. "Give level 25 waters" 
---
bro, i don't even know that tier of spell yet. chill
---
Problem imo comes when there's too many catchup mechanics in place. One thing I liked about vanilla was that my guild started raiding MC after AQ40 was out, but we didn't feel like we were missing out or anything or that we should just skip MC/BWL. It was just the natural progression, do one, then the other. Having played most expansions the first and last patch, there's no real motivation to do the early raids because I can just go to x zone and get gear that's better.
---
500g+ at least.
---
Yeah it's only like this because of the 1.12 patch.  People couldnt do this when WoW came out 15 years ago.
---
I'm only lvl 17 on my first character, sheesh.
---
I get like 2-4 hours of play a day! 
---
Ok so not all of it's on wow. I'm also playing path of exile. But jeez you guys are fast.
---
/gquit
---
Well, they can make the content easier mechanically, because that's what you mean by "adjusted", but that just cheapens the content - if it's easier it has less meaning overall, though I suppose that may be preferable to ignoring it entirely.
---
They can also make the logistical/organizational portion easier, which they did with TBC when they changed raids to 10/25 man instead of 20/40 man. That alone opened up raiding to a bigger subset of the population. Kara/Gruul/Mag were also far more interesting and mechanically complex raids than MC and BWL, because they could be due to less player requirements.
---
Essentially, Blizz did all the things you're asking for - they just did it using the clean slate of BC rather than trying to make it work in vanilla. It came at the cost of invalidating content that was either a joke/uninteresting mechanically (MC/Ony/BWL) or was inaccessible to the vast vast majority of the population due to logistical issues (AQ40/Naxx). ZG and AQ20, two interesting and well done instances, were really the only things that suffered.
---
Wut? Druids have the highest threat generation out of all the tanks.
---
anyone else lagging right now?
---
Druids literally generate more ST threat, my dude.
---
So give up... go back to jail or keep doing nothing. Is that what you want to hear with your comment? smh, huge rap sheet on a family member and he still has a house, a savings and almost clear of debt. all that after he was in and out of jail for 4+ years.
---
It's a great grind zone.  It's a terrible quest zone.
---
40 and it costs 90g total if you're Honored with your race's city (Most people are by 40).
---
Is 25 min the aoe clear speed? Lol. My group cleared it in that time last night, twice, with a regular group, just chain pulling. I know because I only had to MotW everyone once.
---
Been trying to figure this out too. I suppose because it might seem complicated? IDK but I do find it odd druid id commonly the least played on pretty much ever consensus I've seen posted here. I know warrior tanks are amazing and all, but druid tanks got their place and druid healers are still pretty great IMO. Feral DPS and moonkin I understand not being so popular, but I've practically never even seen ONE while playing.
---
1.	Whatever ends up giving you the best stats, since you’re gonna. Be casting anyway.
---
2.	what you are doing is great. 
---
3.	yes, damage usually breaks CC.
---
4.	dot em up, charm them if you have a succumbs, if they are melee and get to close fear them away. Honestly don’t have a lot of experience as a warlock just some against them. Warriors will counter you hard if they know what they are doing and Rogues can kill you quickly if you aren’t paying attention- but you are a very good class for PVP.
---
I mean, it's your choice to play. Feel free to go find another game if you don't want to waste time with this one. If all you're interested in is leveling and grinding as fast as possible then classic WoW probably isn't for you.
---
I mean it fits, myself and others just think art posts shouldn't be here. Art posts ruined /r/wow and /r/dnd
---
Generally, what's the best way to catch a friend up if I play with someone who's a few levels behind at various times? Isn't he getting more experience from higher level mobs if we're questing together? Because our precious questing has seemed to have us staying at the same level gap. Sorry for the poorly-worded question.
---
That's all going to depend on your server.
---
What? No your not. If the meta is 3 mage, a warlock, and a healer then that just cleared out all that dps who are now aoe grinding instances rather the running it from taking your spot in a normal instance run. Start a group and start spamming for more people for whatever instance you want and you will find everyone in short order.
---
Now if your upset because you can't join cleave groups then I don't know what to tell you but I don't think that's what you are complaining about.
---
To be honest ? I’m glad you’re leaving. It’s part of what made classic great, you aren’t cut out for it so move back to retail and we all win.
---
&gt;Those changes are minor for the most part.
---
Minor changes. HAVE YOU READ THE PATCH NOTES???
---

---
wow this is one of the bests I've seen so far, fantastic job OP

---
I'd run something like this. It'll be something in between fury prot and deep prot. You get a lot of the critical stuff from prot, like Last Stand, Imp SB, and Defiance. Since you're going all the way to sword spec I figured you might as well get sweeping strikes too. You lose out on Shield Slam which is a huge threat generator, but hopefully the increased rage from Anger Management and sword spec would off set that.
---
HotW spec? Going for that aswell
---
I always loved the sound design of wow.
---
Committed to straight cat.
---
Off tank (secondary tank). If your pet dies you can just rez it, so using it to save the tank or healer from death is great.
---
CC is only needed when we were all shit 15 years ago.
---
Now, in leveling dungeons, you just shouldn't ever be using hard CC. Its an absolute waste of time.
---
Everyone in game has a back slot where they equip a cape starting as low as level 1.  So... all wow heroes do, in fact, wear capes.  #technicalities
---
There is gear that gives +frost damage.
---
I suppose I should mention the ranged dps is mostly out in the open when you need to pull or finish someone off, but the point is that they have capability for range, unlike, say, Paladins, who can also tank, heal, and dps while leveling, but have 0 ranged abilities (other than against undead and low-health targets)
---
Oh I know, but the way his story reads, it almost sounded like he did it with his fishing pole, which would have been all the better.
---
0-100 Real quick
---
i would like classic to continue with more expansions but not increasing the level cap.  no flying mounts, no new spells or skills, maybe new races, no new classes, no higher item level gear than current max item level.
---
future expansion would require resist attributes.  maybe we get a snowy/ice expansion.  players would have to stack frost resist.  maybe we get a nature expansion players would have to stack nature resist.  your current best in slot is not suddenly worthless because the resist gear wouldn't have as good of stats in regular world stuff.
---
Probably so that you dont have to share mail
---
See at no point during our conversation did you ever attempt to dispute something I said or argue a point of your own and yet you had the audacity to accuse me of fallacy.  Blocking you to make sure I never have to see your drivel again.  Bye
---
What about all the time farming for raid consumables or do you just freeload off other peoples' investment?
---
off-tank (=secondary tank).
---
Karma's a windfury
---
That’s nothing to do with it. The problems with retail are not that there’s a lot of content and people rush through it, it’s just that they spend too much on content that CAN be rushed through instead of making the grindy content more interesting and enjoyable.
---
For instance the War Campaign has a lot of work put into it but you spend about 2 hours doing it while spending months farming Nazjatar which gets stale quickly.
---
Its better to vendor the items and them buy the enchanting mats off the AH to save money.
---
Damn! I thought it was level 20
---
Definitely get imp gouge, I get it in every single rogue build I use.
---
As someone else said its great for bandaging. But the extra time also geves you time to collect a quest objective, or pick an herb.
---
I am worried people who are really invested in classic will finish BWL and quit because there's too little content afterwards. Can't use the excuse that most people are leveling 4 months in. You can believe what you want but once people start raid logging there will be complaints.
---
I'd use OBS
---
You do you, but i hope i'm never in a dungeon with you
---
I would assume this is kind of localized to the mechanostrider... check to see if it happens off the mount. If so then I would assume that people complained about how annoying the running engine of the strider is and they made a dead zone of near silence directly behind the strider where a players camera usually will default to.
---
I'm assuming you could make a "pulling" macro that assign's a skull then shoots your ranged weapon?
---
Go ret for leveling. I feel its pretty obvious which talents you should take. Once you get repentance put the rest of your points into holy
---
Frostblitz, man German is awesome!
---
Skinners also can help u with deviate hides
---
And when they fuck it up again, I won't savor anyone's tears, I'll just be sad that nobody learns from history.
---
That’s frustrating man sorry to hear that :/. Hoping it gets better for you soon!
---
Same with my priest
---
Yeah, Gadgetzan is really close and you'd be a dummy not to go and grab that flightpath before even doing the quests in the Shimmering Flats lol.
---
Because, it specifically states that character progress would be reset in the above example...
---
Basically weapon DPS rating don't matter druids while in cat/bear form.  You always have max weapon skill and a normalized DPS, even with a fishing pole equipped. 
---
What does matter for feral weapons, is the stats they have.  These stats will add to you Attack Power increasing your DPS.  
---
As u/scribblord said, the best DPS weapon for a cat is the MAnual Crowd Pummeler from Gnomer.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler
---
So where do I go to use my training points
---
Yeah I mean we have what, 5 classes and need to bring 40 people to a raid? Have another war sunder the boss, lol.
---
Not in classic and not on trash drops
---
I wouldn't call it a bug. More of an oversight.
---
he protec
---
he attac
---
but most importantly
---
he leaves a mean spirited comment
---
I know my brother and I (both warriors) were pushing 300+ DPS in SM Cath last night. Obscene damage compared to all the DPS I've tanked for, on par with AOE mages.
---
I mean.  I have nearly 300g as a lvl 38 leather worker.
---
Just depends if how much time you're willing to devote to making money vs leveling.
---
Whelp, you better reroll. You just used up your entire character's allocation of luck too early and now you'll have a hell of a time with lategame epics.
---
&gt; So, by your logic the whole exercise is futile because you're literally asking for things we can't do in vanilla.
---
In TBC you had flight form and still couldn't use it in vanilla.
---
Or like the talent stuff that I start getting at lvl 10
---
I can't figure out the silver, it's either a club/chalice or haunch of meat and the gold is an eagle or similar bird.
---
Idk man, classic you have to work for gear, which is rewarding, in retail everyone and their mom get an epic, which doesnt feel rewarding, that was my point.
---
You need to add /stopattack
---
The game is radically different at 60 than during leveling, so don't let that really influence your decision. Play whatever class you feel most connected to or are most excited about. For me rogue was an easy pick because the assassin archetype is something I always choose in games and the playstyle suits me
---
HotW or Moonglow are the healing specs for these early phases. If someone is in Swiftmend right now... yikes.
---
Agility
---
What about a **gameplay** x-pac ? There was some good ideas that got ditched before the original release.
---
 Take the day/night cycle for example : nights were supposed to be really dark and the player would use this survival secondary skill to create light sources.
---
That would be a complete new experience for the players without making the original content obsolete.
---
Noooo don't delete your thread! I'm invested in this story now and I need to know the outcome!
---
I was in a group where guys were needing because the "needed" to save for a mount.... smh
---
Darrowshire
---
Agility.  For mana buy water.
---
Try watching WowHobbs sometime. He's a veteran of vanilla but he's taking his time leveling and his streams are always a good time.
---
Stack agility, don't use arcane shot so much.
---
Spirit is probably 2nd best stat for leveling hunter though.
---
..I've just realized I stopped using cannibalize after about level 4 and that should go back on a hotbar somewhere, that'll help immensely
---
Probably not on your server, but let me say thanks as one of those unemployed dps. Its good knowing there are some folks who still want us. :)
---
While they did technically Nerf it, it wasn't to address this aoe dungeon grinding. It was too correct a bug and make it function as it does in their reference client. It just happens to sort of address this issue. They also fixed battle shout, technically buffing it to give better aoe threat.
---
Main reason why tanks will not join PuGs is idiots (back than and today) thinking the tank is too slow.
---
They have no fucking idea what a Classic tank needs to evaluate before, during and after each pull. Our main, I repeat, MAIN focus is healer's HP and mana.
---
Depending on the healer's HP and mana, we act accordingly. The last pull might have been 2 elites, and the next one might be 3-4 elites, 2 of them being casters and 4 non-elites.
---
If the group DPS can handle themselves, or have massive CC power (mages, rogues, hunters), we might pull faster than usual. But if not, we will pull slower, because even if a single DPS dies, rezzing him and rebuffing him, takes longer.
---
In Classic, like in Vanilla, SLOWER = FASTER, in 99% of the cases.
---
Leave the tanks set the speed. We know what are we doing.
---
Stop pulling shit, because you THINK that we are slow.
---
We are not.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure it wasnt cross server at first.  It first game out when they released the icecrown 5 mans.
---
Agility, it's not even close.
---
I feel ya! In the very early stages of WoW, you could totally exorcise forsaken players, but they had immunity to cc like fear and polymorph.
---
Not in Classic, but in the example the Blackened Defias Armor is BoP so it would be soulbound to the person that picked up the item regardless.
---
I thought he meant arcane spec 😂
---
How do i create a new chat to separate out chats?
---
Sadly most subreddits, if you appeal your ban, they assume you are trying to defend what you say and ban you for even longer. 
---
That’s what happen to me. They said by appealing what I said, it shows that I am unapologetic and permabanned me.
---
Can people stop echo chambering this awful opinion about how druids are just straight useless outside of 5 man dungeons? Please?
---
Wow, they are really in denial over there huh?
---
Yeah tanking is so easy that’s why I can “/1 LF1M Tank” and find 15 eager yanks reply instantly
---
You're a drummer too? Too much talent.
---
It adds a sense of scale and makes the world feel big. If you want to fly everywhere in an instant, there’s another World of Warcraft for you.
---
I just let hunter pets die if I've had to tell them to turn taunt off multiple times.  I also let people run around like their hair is on fire if they run away from me rather than towards me so I can taunt.
---
I protect the healer and the dps that aren't dogshit, if you're dogshit and can't control your own threat, I not wasting time saving you.
---
Arise, my champion!!!.
---
oh snap lol i actually have that! increases atk speed by 50% seems sick but only 3 charges do they ever refresh or nah? ty btw
---
No one is saying that you shouldn't want more from classic wow.
---
What people are saying that it has been 3 fucking weeks since classic went live and you fuckers keep trying to tell blizzard where to drive this before we even get to the point the next raid is out... there is 6 waves of content patches coming our way... so calm your tits, and realize there is exactly 0 point to talk about this right now. 
---
Blizzard isn't going to be following suggestions before they even have removed layering.
---
So how do I spend my talent points and what exactly do they do?
---
Welcome to the warrior club, level your first aid and always bring vendor food with you. Try to invite anyone near a quest to your party. 
---
Warriors are the hardest and most gear dependent class level.  This is basically what you have to deal with to play the best class at 60.
---
Maybe millenials will get a shot at buying a home after all.
---
Anything after this that they do, there should be a recurring Classic server with an option to port characters from there to whatever is next.
---
What propped up the same server BGs were the server forums, which were actually very active.
---
We don't have those now, so you lost that portion of the community right there.
---
Classic Horde 2v1ing Alliance... No honor ;) hahah
---
On the flip side one of the guildmates was bagless until like lvl 15 and we gave him some tailored bags.
---
I just want them to filter out "future of classic". It feels like a look a like post contest going on about "tbc classic" and whatnot.
---
Gunna try it, thanks.
---
#JustAllianceThings 
---
Taking the bait daily
---
Dude why aren't your parents leveling characters with you? I'd love to do that with my son.
---
Queues are going to be bad on highly populated realms and half are going to have to transfer in order to have good vanilla gameplay. The players themselves aren't interested in vanilla if they wont transfer. 
---
Everyone saw this a mile away. Wish we could just lock full pop queue complaints until phase 3.
---
The other servers have high pops at peak times which is still higher than phase 2 caps. The other servers wont become ghost towns they actually NEED people to leave to not have queues because people aren't dropping out.
---
Oh well those with FOMO are usually a stress to build and raid with anyways
---
Balance Druids are awful in PvP as well as PvE. They have no place anywhere in Classic.
---
You used to be able to tear apart undead as a paladin, because they did count as such. It was a glorious first 00.01% of Vanilla.
---
I have confrontation issues. I draw a blank and forget my words, get all nervous. I worry that if I ask and they say NO. Its also loyalty issues. They were very nice to me so far other than these paranoid feelings im getting
---
okay makes sense then ty so no on hit effects, rip sulfuras if i ever got it not that i guess you would wanna use it as feral haha
---
Honestly, if your criticism is narrowly more constructive than “yeah this game sucks”, you should probably expect to be banned.
---
I have been trying to figure this out.
---
So based on my own observations this is the best Hypothesis I can come up with that I use as a working Model For the most part it helps with deciding where to go with farming, it's not perfec:
---
* There is a max number of nodes in a given . let's call it "sector" of a zone. That sector can be a square area of the zone, or a cave. (for example a cave I like to go that I don't see other people go to always has 2 mithril 1 iron. .like clockwork.)
---
* there are more node spawn locations then there are Max nodes the sector can have.
---
* When the number of nodes in a sector is less then max, the respawn timer starts. (I think the respawn timer is like 7 minutes, less for quest type ores like lesser bloodstone.) 
---
* A new node will spawn at one of the possible locations for that sector every X number of minutes until the sector nodes reaches max.
---
Holes in the theory: I have seen multiple nodes spawn at the same time within my detection range. . . so the timer may be on server ticks instead. . . or it may be that I was on the border of two "sectors"
---
I have seen single nodes spawn in sectors where all were cleared out. I have waited and seen only one at a time spawn as well. Which shoots a hole in the above.
---
I have seen some ores spawn faster than others. Generally lower level for the zone spawns faster than higher levels.
---
The other massive hole in the whole thing is layering. . .from what Blizzard has explained, the server adds layers as needed, and combines layers as needed. (never having reached double digit layers) So some of these wierd node spawns could be because I got bumped layers because of adding or merging. (I haven't tried to layer farm nodes.)
---
Vanilla always had issues with tooltips. Felt like every patch had a handful of tooltip fixes and there never seemed to be an end to them.
---
The real deciding facter is whats the better name, Drmoocow for my druid or Shaambulance for my shaman lol
---
Doesn't that only show the level when you hover over the quest objective on your map?
---
no actually you're wrong.
---
In old school vanilla you could FD as an auto hit you and you'd leave combat 100% of the time. Classic FD is just legit broken right now
---
Not till way later, if so. I was WSG/AB constantly back then and they certainly were not.
---
I'm familiar with ultima online and the likes
---
By today's standards classic is old school. This is generation fortnite, remember
---
Was this on Ten Storms Gnomeregan?
---
I'm playing earthbreaker which is low and just started hitting medium at peak. It's a lot more empty then firemaw was but it's no ghosttown
---
They are great in dungeons and still pretty decent in raids. They serve as fantastic off-tanks in most raids. The whole "respec resto for raid" is just a big meme tbh
---
Druids have way more capability then Shaman do.

If you’re willing to sacrifice some speed for your friend to keep up you can agree that he always logs out in an inn/capital so he gets rested while you log out in the world, it makes a difference in the long run.
---
As a follow-on to this, you can make macros that swap bars.
---
There will be plenty of guilds or pug groups that will take in off-meta specs. Now that everyone realizes the phase  1 end game content isn't that difficult, I'm sure a lot of casual raid groups will be more accepting of you.

All I want to do is make my nice little engineer supply company, and all these people throwing 50s undercuts
---
OP or the guy ignoring him?
---
Yeah of course everyone loved the idea of the dungeon finder back then, that's why they implemented one.  We weren't able to see the negative aspects of it until we used it for several years.
---
The topic name was "classic has made me appreciate retail"
---
Trolls are even taller, but they hunch over. I remember seeing a hight chart of races on WoW once, but I can't seem to find it.
---
Why do people feel the need to make posts about him constantly....
---
It's best to just not even pay attention to this stuff. Who cares what a streamer does anyway lol
---
Been playing on and off since retail, have 8 or so toons that were max level before I quit and my highest level alliance toon was like...66? and I leveled him in BC before swapping to play with friends. Been horde ever since. I'm not one of those "FOR THE HORDE!" people that take it seriously but it's where all of my friends have been as long as i've been playing.
---
 If my group of friends that came over with me from CS were alliance at the beginning I likely would've been alliance all the way but now I just stay horde out of familiarity and convenience.
---
stop playing a hunter.
---
I have though. I've tanked RFC, WC, SFK, BFD, RFK, and SM GY, most of these multiple times. All with pugs and all without issue. My retail tanking experience is significantly more extensive but that's a totally different game. 
---
If tanking is incredibly stressful and you feel yourself lashing out at teammates often, I'd be happy to talk to you about it or really anything else that's bothering you. I'm serious by the way, we could talk on discord sometime this weekend if you want.
---
he is entertaining to people... /thread
---
They designed classic for 5 years, 7 if you count patches during the expansion.  They’ve only designed each expansion over the course of two years or so.  Classic was better designed in a lot of ways than retail is.
---
damn really even at like high level? cuz like you guys said the 10.0 dps or 50.0 dps wouldnt matter just the 15 str and 5 agi or whatever okay cool thanks!
---
The first part with the mobs was done in every expension since Vanilla so that doesn't Count.         
---
The second part is retail Alliance bullshit. Back in Vanilla we had pride for our faction and helped everyone in need. Even low level player would attack lvl 60 dudes just because they attacked someone from their faction. No matter the guild or whatever.         
---
And the mongoloid this is more retail than anything else.
---
Why are you so jealous
---
I don’t really care if a big ticket BoE drops I am needing it and I expect every other party member to need.
---
I’m sure there are tanks out there that can hold it but I have yet to group with one who allows me to sit and hellfire my heart away.
---
Nope, I don't want those add-ons cause they aren't appropriate. Not trying to create a witch Hunt, just not acceptable to do this compared to things we already have. Too bad the dev had that oversight and now something that wasn't even that bad is removed, I'm out. I love vanilla and I love classic but not having nameplate distance is a deal breaker for me.
---
Have you tried engineering for the goggles?
---
...sorry
---
Off tank. A secondary tank to assist the main tank in the group when he needs a hand.
---
Yeah, I level almost every Orc and Troll in Mulgore.
---
Favorite low level one is definitely Shadowfang Keep, because it reminds me of Karazhan, my favorite raid.
---
They said no, the real experience is struggling and finding other people to help, and that I should search for a guild.
---
I just saw it on the wiki app a little while back while waiting for classic to come out. It says "males average 10 1/2 feet tall" which is freaking massive compared to how they are in game.
---
Alone it's no good but with friends it's amazing
---
&gt; Dps pulls 3 mobs, all 3 mobs run in separate directions because people are all attacking their own mob. 
---
What does people splitting focus have anything to do with the DPS pulling?  If people are splitting focus, then you're gonna have the same issue whether the tank or the DPS pulls.
---
Also, you're using intentionally extreme and exaggerated hypotheticals to try to make your point.  In reality, when DPS take the initiative to pull, they generally know the risk their taking and are prepared to compensate if things start to get a bit loosey goosey, by using CC to keep the NPCs corralled.
---
And honestly dude, if you need your group to be this disciplined and sanitary for you to feel successful as a tank, you probably should consider another role.  A player is more valuable when they can adapt to the strength and weaknesses of their group than a person that needs things to be strictly controlled and done exactly the way they need/want it.
---
I am planning to raid enhancement which is why my friend suggested getting the axe.
---
You’re probably not using damage spells... unlike my dwarf priest!
---
Every level past 9 you get a talent point. These go into your skill trees. At 60 you will have 51. Theres talent builders online that you can play around with making a build before you do so in game. Each time you reset these talents the cost goes up, starting at 1 gold and capping at 50 gold.
---
New spells become available every 2 levels, once bought these are permenent and usually by the end of the game you will have bought all spells available. 
---
I think by "training" points you meant talent points? If so the first paragraph should clear this up
---
Because wow has always been a game that is very attractive to cringy neckbeard losers, not everyone who plays it, but a significant amount.
---
And those people idolize the guy because he's basically the most successful version possible of their lifestyle.
---
Yeah, I don't see any part of an MMO that should rely on the democratic voting of user-provided assets.  That's just begging for poorly made assets (e.g., time wasters), maliciously made assets (e.g., resource wasters), and generally not expecting anything ever to appear better than officially curated content.
---
Does the WoW playerbase collectively contain this talent? Yes.
---
Will the game be better off because of community supplied assets? I'd venture no, and especially with the legions of idiots who follow streamers...or dare I say, find things like "DO U KNO DE WEY" to be funny--I don't want that community at all responsible for the assets in my gaming experience.
---
The reality is that Classic is going to run out of content. That is a given. People want to know what happens after that. Burning Crusade? I'm down with that. Wrath? Down with that too. Beyond? Nah I'm good.  
---
But what if there's a no-BC route? I really fucking hate retail. I hate where it even went, I don't give half a shit about the lore, I hate what happened to every class, the gear, the talents... fuck retail. I wonder if both could exist. Doubtful obviously. I wonder if some development and polish could be applied to Classic to extend level 60, expand (however little or much) the classes and specs, expand professions, expand PVP, extend raiding content, etc.  
---
It's nice to ponder.
---
Gaining threat sure but the thing is they have no hard taunt so they are horrible for raids where a taunt is needed.
---
Leave the fishing dwarf alone
---
Time for you to spend a few levels doing the SM wings. 
---
GY 30, LIB 34, ARM/CATH 37+
---
Look at any mod community.  Players syck at content. Let not get weeby shit in wow. Kthx
---
logic only works if u have enough info
---
Grobb NA?
---
I saw the video slow down after the frost shock connected, and I *knew* what was going to happen!
---
Because according to other things posted here the mods are tired of the constant "retail is garbage"/"Classic is garbage" pissing matches.
---
There's like 50 threads a day talking about "X sucks" "No Y sucks". Hell OP came into a pro-both games thread and said "No X sucks".
---
Fuck r/classicwow needs to cut down on the endless pissing matches and dumb "Retail players are poopoo heads" content that pops up here regularly.
---
It's one thing if you want to have nuanced discussion about the pros and cons of both games, but too often it just breaks down into "Game bad, you dumb, me no like" from both sides.
---
I will also be testing it in the next few days here as I have finally reached 25 points
---
Ouch you only got one thing right, I'm a gnome. But you got the level wrong, the class wrong, and my level wrong since I'm leveling there as well. But figures you think I'm a high level spawn camping noobs cause that's what you seem to love doing :)... All is fair in love and Warcraft though.
---
what about, gee i dont know... just classic?
---
There is a big difference in playing 2 hours a night vs being able to play a whole day. Not just in terms of the obvious time, but how much you can get into the experience. Makes a big difference when you don't have to think about work or other responsibilities for a bit. 
---
Not saying it's wise to do all that often, but if you use a week of pto to play a game that is super special to you and its a rare event for you to do something like that then I don't see anything wrong with it.
---
It's what I will be doing with Cyberpunk 2077 because that's one of my dream games. I won't be doing it any other time that year and who knows if I do it the next year either.
---
Also there is the money factor. Traveling somewhere hours away is likely to be more expansive then a typical $60 game.
---
vendor/AH greater magic wands. Vendor price is 15s (could be as good as AH depending on how flooded your server's supply is). 
---
You just DE the greens you find for the mats.
---
Let me ask you this. When you open your eyes underwater is it blurry? Bam, now you dont have an answer and I wasted your time.
---
Haha yeah i was thinking the same.
---
Wouldn’t want to play with him myself. But that grandiose ego is fun looking at. 
---
I call him slim slimy cartman.
---
My servers core seem 25-40. SW is thick. IF is kinda a ghost town minus the blacksmith. Rattlegore.
---
I saw the first Alliance raid I've seen on Thalnos server yesterday too. They smashed Grom'gol, it was good to see blood flow. It is a good day to die.
---
Guy ignoring him. I buff people as i can as a priest but the type to whisper you are usually the type to he ungrateful bastards.
---
Can confirm, get like 2-3 whispers and usually a guild chat callout consistently upon login when I was on pservers.
---
It was removed at one point during Vanilla. It wasn’t broken. People found a way to exploit server latency to force reck procs via sit spamming and that’s how it is in Classic currently. 
---
Just because Blizzard made the exploit a feature in TBC doesn’t mean jack shit. My traps are sharing DRs with scatter, blind, polymorph, sleep effects and who knows what else because that’s how it was in 1.12.
---
Exactly, it's some sort of strange phenomenon.  When you form groups the way they're formed in classic, people actually talk and a sense of community is formed.  It's awesome seeing someone out in the wild that you had a successful dungeon run with a couple days ago and saying hey and throwing out a /wave.
---
we did a 10 man lock wsg once, it was funny af seeing 10 corruptions show up on someone, they died in one tick lol
---
I think I am getting old and out of touch bc I do not understand this whole game streaming thing. I mean, I can barely find enough free time for myself to play, why the frig would I waste that time on watching someone other douche play the game?  Oh well, I will continue to ignore all streamers and enjoy my classic experience
---
I've had tanks thank me for having my pet pick up loose adds or random pats that get aggro'd simply because how tank they are while we kill the pack.
---
And I've also seen tanks scream at other hunters who are too dumb to turn growl off
---
No problem. We all stand together.
---
Classic+ would completely go against the aspect of classic. People are saying they want new content. Know what new content brings? Class balance changes. Know what that means? Classic is no longer classic.
---
Its self-depreciating humor, not a brag at how "non-nolife" they are.
---
You should try it sometime, it might improve your attitude.
---
I made 5 silk bags last night for myself but forgot my skill was @ 150 and I needed to train expert. 
---
(:
---
If anything we need to do it before Naxx.  Once that gear ships, we're on a power creep course that will be impossibly to stop without nerfing gear people already have.
---
Given that we already know that world of Warcraft is doomed to be ruined by blizzard with their pursuit of mobile phone gamers it’d be best that they ignore re-releasing expansions that made retail the hot garbage it is today.
---
They should bring in some talent and fork the game and make a completely unique timeline in the classic vein.  Keep 40 man raids.  Don’t fuck with gear progression like BC did.  Etc.
---
I agree with you.
---
With the exception of the main tank the rest of the gear should be distributed fairly based on a structured system
---
I've been doing it manually, hoping to try this tonight. Thank you!
---
You just wrinkled my brain man
---
Very Helpful. Thank you for not being rude like everyone else on here when you ask for advice or help. MVP
---
haha really? how come you say that being from Golemagg
---
Ive been pretty much saying this since Wrath of lich king... so about 10 years ago. Many people simply didnt know about it, or had straigth up forgotten about it. I'm glad now that classic is here, people can finally see it for themselves.
---
noted, thanks man
---
idk about thaaaaat
---
That's a great thought. Thanks so much!
---
We got enough queue..
---
I'm doing decent with mining and engineering, making bombs and using them to do single or double pulls. Also going to get a bow for that reason. I never really need heal pots, just healing after the fights.
---
Classic + would be an absolute blast. A real old school mmo constantly up to date.
---
They 100% do. My talents in improved battle about affect the tool tip as well as the details listed by the trainer when an improved version is available from leveling.
---
I agree with this, it's my mantra when playing this game. I don't care if it's not an RPPVP server - like its an mmoRPg game. I think RP gets a bad rap ... the way I see it, is it's not much different from Improv. I love improv comedy and I approach many of my encounters in WoW with a mind geared towards improv. The nice thing about it too is that I can just transition out of it at any time without upsetting people. And I find more often than not, people will partake in the improv (I wouldnt even call it RP(due to the sitgma)) and it's great. It's what makes the game feel alive - To storyline the game using your own imagination and projecting it on to the realm is a glorious thing.
---
Mmm...jelly donuts....
---
that was so fun &lt;3
---
I’d leave any guild doing that stupid ass “loot council” if you can equip the item, and it’s a upgrade, you deserve it just as much as anyone else.
---
yeah im just happy we have classic.
---
Anyone want to start a new guild with me on EU Pyrewood Village (Horde)? I'm an old school vanilla GM/MT.
---
I don't want to join your already created guild. I want to find some people who are interested in founding a new guild with me.
---
Pick your server
---
http://www.classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Herod
---
When I realized you could do it just like retail I stopped. Let’s you one click update and all that.
---
Except paladin tank doesn't have a hard taunt which doesn't work in raid environments where tank swapping is needed.
---
I'm using nugenergy. Seems slightly wonky sometimes thought
---
with goblins and gnomes racing over them
---
Its a terrible choice that promotes drama
---
BoEs are need by all in a pick up group.
---
In raids meter whoring healers will spam warlocks in anticipation of them life tapping.
---
Wouldn’t it be a shorter range in German? 30m is less than 30yards. 30yards=27.4m in fact.
---
Sulfuras is almost even. I think the rest are horde dominant.
---
Blammo gang
---
Can we stop saying "We have work, wives, kids" as some sort of badge or "why my opinion matters more" thing? Because those same obligations apply to like the vast majority of adults.
---
Ya I was thinking of going to an area a few levels below me with him and just spam killing everything for a while
---
Can you please send me through the mage macros you use?
---
I agree, but it’s still not wrong to say Loot council is hypothetically best for the guild. I still avoid loot council guilds because almost all the time it’s favoritism, and once you start giving gear prio to one person they outperform others, which is a bad cycle of a player doing better because they’re loot prio rather than grinding more for the guild, etc.
---
If you’re in a raiding guild that’s lead by a group of friends and it’s loot council, they probably intend to prio themselves. Watch for that
---
Karazhan!
---
GUCCI GANG
---
People dont know how to have fun nowadays. Good meme my dude
---
I haven't played it since before first playing vanilla wow but I'm a fan of what Jagex did with RuneScape classic with allowing the community to suggest and vote for new content.
---
I don't how how that could work with wow classic as new additional content isn't exactly supporting the Classic vibe but it could be interesting to see.
---
Yes, its unfair.  Loot council prioritizes the raid group as a whole, which means gearing certain people first.  When someone who isn't the "optimal choice" gets gear, it is for the purpose of keeping the raid satisfied enough to not leave.
---
ban this nerd
---
Blizz is def monitoring how the majority of players are leveling. once the non autists get to 60 they'll actually start thinking about what they Wana do next. I hope they go with some alternative Wow history content instead of relaunching the same xpacs
---
Not quite to this level, but I've been slaughtered twice now by the same Horde players I recognize from before I transferred to Earthfury from Skeram.
---
This is kind of the point though. A properly prepared and competent feral isn’t suboptimal and certainly isn’t a meme spec.
---
Just join a new guild and make new memories with better people
---
The struggle, need an apoth buddy like me sending you crates of swiftness potions
---
I'll save someone from death if I know the walk back is long.
---
Gen X was like 10 years old in the 80s. How did they "save video games" when their Boomer parents were the ones buying them for them?
---
Yes it was fixed
---
Takes a whole new dimension when you realize tthat taunt in classic has a 5 yard range.
---
Your anecdotal experience is wrong?
---
Idk but he’s irritating and if I could, I’d like to never see his face pop up on YouTube anymore. I remember when everyone was getting DDoSd, his stream had gotten a lot of viewers. I pop in to see what’s going on and he’s literally standing in Stormwind begging his crowds of fans to give him gold. Just taking handouts from a shit load of people. The fuck?? And 100k+ people were watching people give this greasy dude get 100’s of gold and free items. He was so painfully not funny that it was cringey. Idk how he has gotten so popular. Makes me sad that there are genuinely funny streamers that don’t get the attention they deserve, and then there’s this guy....
---
Ahhhh well, I don’t think I’m gonna tip the scales mate
---
Loot Council is the best system for progression, because it makes sure that loot is distributed such that it's always the biggest upgrade to the raid as a whole. Sure me and the other paladin both need that Int ring, but maybe for me it's a 1% upgrade and for him it's 5%. We're both going to roll need, but it's best for the raid as a whole for him to get it. 
---
Obviously the loot council only makes sense if everyone in the guild treats the raid like it's one big cohesive team, and if you trust the leadership to always make the best decision. If the goal is progression, however, it's absolutely the best loot system.
---
Sure, but anyone is really capable pr tanking Ony/MC.
---
When people get geared theeat becomes an issue for druids, where for warriors their threat gain scales with that of the test of their raid so long as they stay geared.
---
Come BWL and AQ, druid tanks are phased out as they are notorious for dropping aggro to dps.
---
*ghost wolf form*
---
Oh lawd he comin!
---
Ya, this. I see so many alliance but they refuse to group and just run around trying to steal mobs. Alliance cries about horde ratio but refuses to cooperate together, logic.
---
This right here. I play EvE online and now classic wow both essentially grindy games with a focus on player interaction. Back when I played retail I wish I could just turn my brain off and use my spells. I love the animations, sounds, and look of the spells in wow that is what keeps me engaged in a heavy grind session. I love being able to catch up on podcast or streams while improving my character.
---
Nobody I knew used those....
---
Very interesting post thank you
---
I highly doubt naxx will even be out a year and a half from now. The discussion is premature and the amount of threads on the topic are redundant.
---
It alters it no matter what but it would correct only when you moved your mouse while holding right click.
---
I went in there to wrap up the necklace recovery quest, and the free 14 slot bag at the end. I don't do dungeons for speed XP. I don't even pay attention to my XP bar in a dungeon. I do it for quests, something different from being out in the world, making friends, and keep my fingers crossed for a loot drop. Uldaman is a little odd in that it covers what, a 10 or 12 level range?
---
I kinda skimmed the video but I didn’t actually see or hear what advice you are needing.
---
I am assuming it’s just general advice so I will give it a shot:
---
-	Take your time, it isn’t a race to level just enjoy things as they come. 
---
-	Be careful as a mage for over pulling as you’re going to drop like a bag of bricks if it’s too much.
---
-	You can AOE farm multiple mobs at a time, but the technique takes getting used to and if you’re interest just search up some variation of Mage AOE Leveling on google.
---
-	try to use the AH sparingly to save gold as you are pretty self sufficient as a Mage and shouldn’t necessarily need anything extra, but item upgrades are always nice.
---
-	You are not required to buy every spell as they unlock, and doing so is a surefire way to always be broke.
---
-	Getting your mount at level 40 will increase your speed by 60% which will allow you to move around more freely without wasting too much time. It’s around 100g for that.
---
I'm not at that level yet. But I would guess scarlet monestary will be the best bet. Dungeons offer nice experience, often quests, and good loot, with chance of rare drops.
---
Hello! I’ve been playing WoW off and on since BC, mostly played MoP, WoD, Legion, and BFA. I’m full force in love with classic, but I have no friends to play with anymore! I’m looking for some friendly players to group with for dungeons and eventually raids! I’m currently an Alliance lvl 28 warrior on Sulfuras. I get the most enjoyment tanking instances for hours! If you’re reading this, and around 28, PM your character name and I’ll add ya later! Thanks in advance, future friend!
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
This is the groundwork for some of the best thread on r/prorevenge
---
Worm tongue those motherfuckers and strip them nude!
---
There is, when the people who scheduled had to cancel and you are short on people. Chances are, you will take a guild mate with you rather than a pug.
---
Yeah focus the target the tank is, and then give him like..3~ seconds to get a sunder armor or two on the enemy then you can blast off
---
The same way reality TV is so popular now. For some reason people love watching stupidity.
---
No might for you!
---
Oh yeah, you should play an alt.   That's what I'm gonna do.   Game could stay like this for years and I'd be cool
---
you can also probably skip purge, won’t kill you
---
I kind of only leveled alts as twinks. Stockpile rested, burst up to next bracket, buy BOE's, camp out, repeat. I had a rogue, a warlock, a priest, a mage, and a shaman.    
---
Nothing was more fun than the shaman.
---
Thank you! There's two sides to every tale and the Alliance is definitely an important part. I feel like Horde usually get's a lot more attention here
---
The Onyxia prequest on the Alliance side has to be some of the best singular storys in WoW period, it plays out like a political thriller and you start with it the moment you start as human.
---
Is this common at higher levels? I have done 5 dungeons so far from lvl 15-35 and each time we did them properly with CC, taking our time one pack at a time. Even in groups with lots of aoes we never mass pulled to aoe down.
---
If I'm having to mana tap a lot I just tell the healer to only throw me a heal if I get really low. It's pretty rare for me to pull aggro off a tank, I usually only throw dots early on and let the tank build up aggro before I go nuts.
---
I played on a p server with 4 to 8k people, and there was definitely a mafia going on. They killed me even if I was only levelling and not competing for the leather, only because I came close to one of the spawn points(which I didnt know about) and they were 60s from BOTH FACTIONS that didnt attack each other, rather they attacked anybody that wasnt with them. Once layers are gone and enough people reach 60, if you ask me, they will come back. Because if you control supply, you control pre-bis for fury warriors, rogues, hunters and even the meme specs of ret pally, enhance shaman and feral druid, the profit incentive is definitely there.
---
Damnit man, why do you have to hit me with this existential crisis on a Friday. Save that stuff for Monday.
---
well i tried to raise awareness for this, but my post got removed already because apparently it wasn't "wow" related....

Thank you for your submission 4Goblin20. It has been removed from [/r/wow](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow) because:

Posts must be about World of Warcraft.
---
If it's not about World of Warcraft, it doesn't belong here. WoW pros and personalities doing non-WoW related things are not counted as related to WoW; this includes arguing between one another on Twitter, playing a game other than WoW, and sword fighting with pool noodles. **If it requires a title to explain how it's related to World of Warcraft, then it doesn't belong here**
---
This includes real life photos that look like WoW, videos that remind you of WoW, the many, many games that rip off WoW, etc. If the photo is comparable to something in Azeroth, you may post it as a self post with a comparison shot In the case of images or videos, we consider the content without captions (i.e. - the title of the reddit post, any captions or text added to the image or video itself) to decide if a post is related. In the case of memes or joke images, we require them to be wholly recognizable as being a "WoW meme". If you remove the text and the title from the post, it must be recognizably about World of Warcraft. All generic memes are subject to removal." 
---
Apparently you cant even make posts related to the subreddit...
---
Each can be discussed entirely on their own merit without needing a comparison to the other. Even if you feel the need to compare, many are incapable of doing so objectively without themselves or others ultimately saying something not far from, “Classic is the perfect game. Retail is absolute shit for xyz reasons”..
---
Objectivity is often lost and people resort to being aggressive and disparaging toward any dissenting thoughts.
---
How long did it take to get to 60 doing this? I find that I am hardpressed to skin everything mine nodes and still level as quickly as I would like and I am not rolling in gold.
---
I’ve got a cold and those damn train sounds when he’s blowing the horn almost had me blowing snot everywhere. Thanks asshole
---
Which quest has a bag reward? The one from the necklace that drops off trash?
---
LC is a *good* system for progression, but I'd argue that it isn't the *best*. Arguably, each player knows what their current character/spec needs more than the raid lead or even class lead does; which is why things like loot list are used by pretty hardcore guilds instead.
---
It's pretty good for cutting edge progression but IMO LL beats it in most regards.
---
Kids don’t play alliance and end up like this wee lad
---
Damage numbers is not everything, man. For some classes, anyway. What is wrong with someone playing an enhance shaman as long as it's doing correctly?
---
5 rogues/wars in a group VS. 4 rogues/wars with an enhance sham that can properly totem weave and throw backup heals are gonna have negligible differences when it comes to successfully clearing content without hiccups.
---
It's not a "carry" if someone is doing the best that they can do. Proper performance &gt; topping meters but fuck up mechanics every single time in my book.
---
They do early, sure. But MC/Ony isn't a challenge in the slightest, they're perfect early but during AQ they're phased out totally as soon as Mages are actually raiding with fire AoE and warriors/rogues are critting often.
---
You do realise that not all of the EU is German,  right?
---
As Horde a lot of these are completely wrong, you can't even get quests at some of these starting levels. Useless mapm maybe its inteded only for Alliance.
---
Make sure your friend is always logging out at an inn for rested bonus. Kill everything in your path on the way to quests. And do dungeons appropriate to your friends level.
---
U googled it and then far sighted for karma.
---
Obscure meme but it works, sir.
---
Just to the top with you, honestly this is the one and true counterpoint
---
Spec into holy and get holy shock and you’ll practically be a holy mage! 
---
😄
---
sounds like you're doing fine then. If you're questing against same level mobs, you should be finishing a single mob with at least half health from my experience.
---
The purpose of a loot council (ideally) is to give out the items in a manner that benefit the raid most, and puts the raid above the needs and wants of the individual. Whatever you think is "fair" is entirely subjective. It's not as important in classic as it is in retail, where gear often makes a big difference in killing a mythic boss. In situations like that, you want the best gear on the players/classes that can utilize it the best. The goal is progression, not gear. Gear is just the byproduct of progressing.
---
If everyone just /roll for gear, you can have situations like a paladin rolling on melee weapons for their prot spec even though they're a healer and prot paladins are a joke. Loot council prevents this.
---
What's VC?
---
That crit tho
---
The people behind the design of the classic philosophy no longer work in the company.
---
&gt;As I was taming a feral druid
---
I read that part incorrectly and really wanted to roll a hunter for a split second.
---
i literally forgot about this from like 15 years ago. If you see a troll priest /train ing through the night, youll know its me.
---
Fun fact: no two classes are alike, no two classes scale the same, no two classes have the same timing of damage (burst vs progressive vs hybrid of both).
---
If you're a little bitch that cries that another class is 30% higher in SOLO DPS, you're focusing on one factor. In contrast, class combinations, play style, usefulness, tricks/clutch potential are all factors you overlooked, so maybe go see a doctor about your own degenerative brain diseases because it's twats like you that ruined classic in the first place.
---
Let’s goo
---
It’s just salty people on reddit getting mad about people choosing to be efficient.
---
It’s popular because it’s a different way to play and it CAN be faster. It’s not necessarily any easier. In the past I have used 3/3 in imp blizzard and that worked fine. Try grinding on mobs 2 levels below you to get the hang of it. When that becomes easy/boring then move to mobs your level
---
!remindme 9 hours

Humor
---
And yet this guy is the #14 MT in the world with a perfect clear rate:  https://www.twitch.tv/winry__/videos
---
Ohh optional for sure, but I stand by my recommended timeframe. If they release bc in a year, even option, it will cause some major fractioning on the playerbase imo.
---
As a wise man once said, “slow down so you can take a look around.”
---
&gt;A. That only addresses PvE. PvP is still fucked.
---
If we're talking Classic+, Blizzard has tools to handle this for PvP whether it be PvP gear having resil or just higher stam pools to allow more buffer time for healers.
---
&gt;B. It cuts new players out of doing newer content completely. If you need AQ gear at least to kill mobs for 'new' T4, but youre a new player...what are your options? Try to find a catch-up guild where its going to take forever to get gear because so little gear drops in raids?
---
This is a tough question, I've talked about it on the /r/classicwowplus sub, but ideally content would be fed to the players in the following manner over the course of a year, culminating in the last patch(using placeholder ilvls for examples):
---
-Start cycle-
---
- new 10 man raid (ilvl 60)
---
- new dungeons (ilvl 60)
---
- new 20 man raid (ilvl 60)
---
- new 40 man raid (ilvl 70)
---
-end cycle-
---
-start new cycle-
---
- new 10 man raid (ilvl 65)
---
- new dungeons (ilvl 65)
---
- new 20 man raid (ilvl 65)
---
- new 40 man raid (ilvl 75)
---
This way **NEW** players are given up to a year in buffer time to catch up with a new raid, a new set of dungeons and an additional new raid before the BIG "next tier" raid gets released. 
---
So to answer your question, yeah it'll be harder for new players to kill the level 60 elites out in the world for the first while but if they join a guild or do a couple dungeon runs for the current staple of gear they can catch up pretty quickly. 
---
&gt;C. Something thats less talked about and could be prevented, though when looking at past xpacs its certainly a danger....often times as xpacs move on because regen, crit, etc are all higher Blizzard tends to make bosses hit harder/faster, and it can get to be stressful, especially on the healers. Hard hitting bosses are fine and all, but when all bosses have to do that or theres nothing for the healers to do, it can get stressful to raid and a lot of people dont find that fun (its actually one of the reasons that people wanted classic).
---
I'm honestly not sure about this one, you'll have to elaborate on your question. Are you asking how hard raids should be?
---
You know I have a question though. 
---
Back when I played in vanilla anyway, in the higher end dungeons and raids they had a hunter doing the pulling. Like in UBRS and Strat, then MC and beyond. I was that hunter, but it was a designated thing and I pulled to the tank so the tank could focus on TANKING and I could just bring him mobs. I would just use rank one arcane shot and if I had a problem dropping threat I could feign death. 
---
Are people doing that in like MC? I could see that not being the case for the dungeons. I haven’t been watching any streams of the people doing MC so I’m curious if they’re just having the tanks pull.
---
So there are upgrades.
---
Definitely, but that's more than what people are giving them credit for, you would think Druids couldn't tank end game 5 man's reading this Sub sometimes.
---
I think my original comment was worded poorly, I completely agree. Always need world epic drops in parties!
---
That is some university level logic.
---
Yeah questie is very helpful without being super obnoxious and you can toggle it on and off. It'll help you avoid missing quests too!
---
1. type /macro
---
2. hit "new"
---
3. select an icon (or dont) and give it a name.
---
4. hit OK 
---
5. select the macro you just made
---
6. in the macro text box, type "/s UwU"
---
So everything being equal lets go with yeah that makes sense, but lets expand this a little bit.  What are the most likely options to be found raiding in vanilla/classic? Loot council and DKP.  Each with their own problems.   rolling on loot is great if everyone is on the same page and everyone will continue to consistently show up. 
---
Now lets step back a bit and take a raid leader perspective.  Live wow has basically allowed us to take 10-30 people into a raid for about 5 years meaning if someone doesn't show up to every raid no big deal the raid will flex for us.   
---
Now go back to 40 people needing to be organized and geared.  Say optimistically 20 out of 40 have been guild members or played with each other since wrath (seems a most common xpak for people playing classic who came over with their whole guild/communities).  That is a decade of knowing that those 20 players will show up to raid every day. Knowing those 20 players will work together bring consumables and supplies to the raid.  Should a guild that is going to take literal months to gear 40 people not prioritize those who they know aren't going to gear up and ditch the guild or raid once they have the loot they want?
---
Even in BFA and personal loot we see a drop in attendance once people get all the loot they care about in a tier.
---
Personally, I plan on being fair about loot in my guild's raid and I'm not saying it's right to give most of the loot to you're most loyal members first, but I can see the argument.  Especially when those people who you know will show up every week also will stick around to keep running to gear people later.   
---
The place where loot council's start drama, imo, is when people start trying to gear alts before the whole raid is caught up.  
---
All that being said, Tanks in classic will need a loot priority and not just for clearly tanking gear, threat will be a real issue and gear that looks like good dps stuff will also need to be weighted with tank threat.
---
I play with a UI that has it baked in, but my understanding is that it's a one time deal.
---
Or Faerie Fire as a druid.
---
Establish clear rules beforehand, you can write it as a macro.
---
„If you get aggro within the first 3 seconds of a fight, you will have to deal with it yourself. You won’t get heals because that’s how our healer dies and I will be busy building aggro on the other mobs.“
---
Most DPS learn really quickly to behave once they’ve died to their own trigger-happy stupidity.
---
Wow you really are just shit Haha
---
which is enough time to pop shield and get a dot on the lock
---
&gt; Dps warrior tanking 4 mobs = healer is at 0 Mana by the end of the pull.
---
This has not even been remotely close to my experience with the game, but ok
---
Each individual talent tells you what it does. For example, one of the first frost talents reduces the cast bolt of frost bolt by 0.1 seconds, and after 5 points in there obviously that's 0.5 seconds shorter cast time. Some talents will give you an ability. For example, Ice block, which freezes you in a block of ice for a short time making you immune to all damage and effects. 
---
To spend a talent point, just click on the one you want.
---

Not gonna comment on the kind of media you consume, but i find it great that a 90 year-old still plays Wow. Respect!
---
Harhar I care about my community and their games and am therefore clearly extremely angry.
---
Wait, I thought loving Classic was about community?
---
And Hey, I've played more Classic in the last month than retail and have been playing for 14 years. Would people on here complain about someone commenting on pro-Classic posts that say "No Classic sucks WotLK was the best"?
---
Wait they do! 
---
Would they have a problem with the mods here deleting low effort content shitting on Classic? 
---
I doubt it. Fuck I've seen people here saying that retail players should be banned from the subreddit.
---
!remindme in 1 day
---
True classic.  I don't care for any of the other expansions, and I know Blizzard would fuck classic+ up.  I'm legitimately curious what new thing Blizzard has created in recent memory that makes you guys think they wouldn't.
---
&gt;+10 armor
---
&gt;+5 arcane resist
---
&gt;a whole +1 dagger skill
---
&gt;+10 AP
---
Really makes me wonder what the devs originally intended for these set bonuses. They're likely leftovers from early alpha versions of the game or something.
---
Phase 2 can't happens soon enough! Can't wait for epic wpvp battle that actually give honor rank :D
---
No ones gonna give your boomchicken the gear you need to he powerful in vanilla pvp tho.
---
Whenever a same faction spits on me, I just reply something along the lines of "you spit just like your mother"
---
He has a different spawntime in all layers, depending on when he was last killed in said layer
---
I think having a list of people to choose from is something that ruins it, especially for those classes who arent as desirable as others.

---

---
That's an unreasonable expectation. People have lives, if you're so pressed for time, Classic dungeons are not the content for you.
---
LFG MC Pug, holy mage. 
---
Sounds legit.
---
Because they are volunteer janitors for an online forum who power trip.
---
*plays a fantasy game* *picks the faction with a human race*
---
Blizzard has stated they're planning to release content in 6 phases to be aligned with the original timeline, from the release of Vanilla wow 18 months later Naxx came out.
---
Why are you doubtful they'll follow this timeline?
---
I’m not an expert but weapon skills adds to hit chance. You need a lot of added hit chance especially if your a dual wielder in order to not suck at dps in raids. These help a lot and make you need a lot less + hit gear.
---
This is great!
---
Don't police my content.
---
Morgraine is immense for alliance
---
Yo as someone on Stalagg, it does NOT feel like majority alliance.
---
WoW did not invent questing at all. 
---
They just added more in a marketplace where MMOs either were sandbox or really grind heavy to level.
---
Yeah, I feel like every ?? that ganks me now did exactly this.  They said it was going to be a while for the next content to roll out.  You guys are scum.
---
Not that it would happen for a few years at least, but how would your classic experience suffer from TBC or WotLK servers?
---
&lt;Goon Squad&gt; is a name I didn't miss, personally. That may have been from experiences in other games though.
---
Yeah, me too.
---
HORDE MASTERRACE!
---
Or perma banning people for stating their opinions. (Just delete the fucking post if it’s that repetitive.) It’s not a good look for the sub, and makes new comers not want to participate it in.
---
&gt;What’re u doing with two frost bolts on your bar?
---
Its called down ranking. Lower ranks have lower mana cost and faster casting speed. So you can use rank 1 to apply the slow very quick. Also you can use lower middle ranks for mana preservation, but usually for damage specs you only need rank 1 and max rank. For healing, they can use 7-8 different ranks for different situations in raids and thats how healers SHOULD play.
---
I'd far prefer that the free transfers are to the locked server....otherwise the new server would be mostly max level characters...and isn't Classic locked on 1.12 but with content being released in phases?
---
Welcome to Lakeshire
---
I don't think they found out I have suspicions. You are right in saying that peoples voices do sound similar online, which is why i was being cautious. 
---
I have been trying to be coy but no one is biting with the nostalgia requests hah
---
Is there any way to exclude lvl1 or lvl1-5 characters from this and  classicrealminfo.com as well? it really skews the numbers, there are some servers with 10k lvl1 and it makes the bar charts impossible to read even. Also how accurate is this addon? There's vastly different numbers on the 2 sites, like Noggenfogger A26k:H39k and on classicrealminfo A24k:H16k that is an insane difference, which one to trust ?
---
They dont know about 5sr and spirit tap then. I have no issues with mana. Mages sit and drink and I dance.
---
Well, I think after like... 3 or 4 you should be gone for good personally, so I feel like they're just getting around to something theyve missed for a while. 
---
I understand that being banned for being banned previously is dumb. If you only had 1 ban, and were banned for something innocuous, there would be an issue.
---
Thats not the case here though bud.
---
Yup! Blizzard isn't that great until you have the 3/3 slow (and the chill talents in the 2nd tier of frost tree).
---
Oof
---
He's not automating anything. All he's doing is accessing his pc from another pc remotely. Hes still doing everything by hand. Definitely not bannable.
---
Make sure you are getting a New weapon every 2-3 levels... Also you need to get a 2Hander with the Highest DPS. Dont worry about stats, they arent important till way later.

Dumb question but how much does someone usually tip a mage for water?
---
I don't think it's selfish at all, nor is it a meme spec. This is a fantasy RPG. People want to and are free to play as whatever they wish, because that's how the game was designed. 
---
There's mythic raiding on the modern side of the game for min/maxing and pure optimization. The RPG elements have been long gone.
---
I appreciate your response though, and I do agree with a lot of what you say.

Man you really just can't stop with the insulting people for no reason, can you?

Yes. Reddit is a series of echo-chambers and any 'wrong think' is quickly banned.

this was the first scene I saw in wow, back in early 2005.  one friend had started a few weeks before the rest of us , and when he could not speak of anything else for weeks , we had to join him, but since the game was sold out we had to wait.   I watched him ride around as a lvl 41 paladin in this scenery.
---
Enchantrix is the Disenchanting one. And because that addon is part of the Auctioneer pack, I'm gonna guess the AH information is from Auctioneer. u/the_cro505
---
&gt;Why are you so upset man? Chill out. None of us will ever meet.
---
He posted a well reasoned informed comment that rejected the circlejerk this post was trying to incite. Pretty solid comment if you ask me, didn't get the impression that he was at all angry. Moreso that you're being defensively butthurt for being embarrassed online, and ate now trying to gaslight him.
---
&gt;My question was rhetorical anyway. I didn't want an answer, I already knew why. Those rules are in place because snowflakes like you get their wittwe feewings huwt.

Wow, dude seriously? You just suck my man.

Now I'm just sad, is this a troll or are you legitimately like this? Either way it does not inspire hope in the future of humanity.
---
Only when WF procs
---
Skarm tank or w/e on youtube. Look at his vanilla clips. Hes tanked all the way to naxx...AND he has a windfury prot warrior and he prefers the druid lol.  Keep in mind we will be getting a bunch of new talent in classic, people are playing way differently now. He even tanked nefarian, but he doesnt recommend it.
---
Why though
---
I wonder how many \#nochanges people play unfinished specs like Balance, Retribution, and Disc.

I guess you never played wow, so im not discussing it with you :)
---
They're BiS for pretty much ever though for Non-Orcs and Humans, wdym? Removing Glancing as a concept is pretty damn strong for Dualwield Fury, unless you get the C'Thun dagger (Which doesn't cap it) or kill KT for the + Weaponskill sword. I do agree on the economy mattering a lot for the price, however.
---
With the latter situation: Does gear even matter even matter anymore if you killed KT? Most people won't get there, several will be fine with farming lots of gold.
---
Also people start later than launch I reckon. We don't know the launch window of phases, but there'll be plenty of people still leveling while others are raiding already.
---
Cdont
---
If you think anything I said in that reply was an insult, you deserve to be insulted.
---
Liberal snowflake.
---
LOL! A lot
---
That is a really good one hahah!

Early itemization is just generally trashy.  FFS a bunch of the SFK Rare Cloth drops give +AGI
---
Found the Alliance scum.
---
I am quite certain that a reasonably competent player can walk into MC and BWL in ye olde resto PvP spec and be fine lol. 
---
Stop giving content more respect than it deserves.
---
People can play how they want. All you can do is provide them the content/mechanics. How they approach it and what value they derive from it is up to them, on an individual to individual basis.
---
Still bad criticism, if it's so bad for him he could start hamstring kiting or move towards the next mob while killing like the pros
---
Really? I feel like like (on Incendius at least) I see the DPS demand about the same as healers.  No reason why you can't DPS in a group as shadow, just be careful with your threat from MB.
---
Nature Resist pots are gonna be huge around AQ time. Getting those mats will be worth your efforts.
---
Ya guys, you think you know how you want to play, but you don’t.
---
Wow, thank you for taking the time to write such a helpful answer!
---
I'm definitely going to use this as a guide to professions :)
---
But one thing, in the first sentence you say "Blacksmithing and BS"... Isn't that the same thing? Isn't BS = Blacksmithing?
---
I hope so.
---
Duuuuh, people aren't allowed to have opinions on reddit... unless your opinions are the same as mine ofcourse...
---
I was just curious no need to downvote jeez. For real though if you guys are doing this thats kinda sad... Its just a game
---
Op is receiving, not giving
---
They did once they figured out that you can just zerg his ass before any of the drakes land and completely ignore fight's mechanics.
---
no i dont regularly post on classic vs retail threads
---
&gt; Any tips on multi-target tanking as a warrior? I find that I'm losing aggro to groups of 3 or more pretty regularly.
---
You have extremely limited options in Vanilla, but you set the pace of the dungeon. If people are being attacked/killed and there is nothing you can do about it, tell them politely... then stop trying to save them. After they die a few times they will learn.
---
I like how the priest gave him a fort buff right after like a biscuit
---
Cdowns
---
I pay a minimum of 10s a stack and give a tip on top! I have never had any mage turn down the offer
---
We dont need any new questing zones in classic+ though, since the level cap won't raise.  Only new portals for new raids. Absoluteltly NO new 5-mans.  Also since there no catch up mechanics in classic, no new quests are needed either, unless it's a new attunement chain that gives no gear rewards, for which I'd rather them just use the existing world anyways.  
---
But yes Uldum would be a great candidate for a future raid tier.
---
And it's a lot harder to play this way. Really it's a disadvantage but it's good enough for being away from home
---
I really thought classic servers were created to cater to the people who wanted a more casual social/leveling/exploration experience.  I'm kind of surprised people rushed to 60 to start raiding MC, I figured retail was designed for people that wanted to rush to the endgame and grind like that.
---
You acknowledged that this post doesn’t belong in this subreddit man
---
I mean a) the scenario (a player is unfamiliar with etiquette/mechanics) is not an unrealistic or uncommon one for groups that include players who haven’t focused heavily on dungeons while leveling - although of course the dialogue is exaggerated because it’s a joke, and b) notice how none of Bfaramir’s party is actually being mean to him, they just know that the top dog’s about to realize his mistake.
---
The culture shock between the two games is funny, and jokes about it don’t have to be seen as mean-spirited.
---
The video is a little unrealistic, though. I mean the retail player isn’t playing a mage, and isn’t in a group full of other retail players playing mages patting each other on the back about their ultra-efficient party composition. Suspension of disbelief ruined.
---
Why are paladin buffs 5 minutes?  Fucks sake that's annoying.
---
Is there an add-on or macro that can auto rebuff based on class and/or time (or with a button click it can check and rebuff)?
---
I thought I found a macro before, but it didn't work and I didn't understand anything about it - but it has been nearly 15 years since I played this game, and never played a paladin.
---
if someone in my group said this, i would kick them asap otherwise 100% they will be an issue at some point in the dungeon. most people arent min-maxing 100% of the game and would rather have  fun. thats why im enjoying classic, taking my time (and saving gold for my epic mount)
---
&gt;It will compete with Retail in a way that Classic itself does not.
---
Not at all.  Let's be honest.  Most people playing retail right are not interested in a classic style game.  Most playing classic are not interested in a retail style game.  If classic+ is just another version of the game to appeal to a different kind of audience, then they're not really competing for the same market.
---
That's not true, shadow priests have excellent mana return through spirit tap. When played correctly, priests have the least downtime of all the casters, and they should rarely need to drink.
---
Obligatory /r/hydrohomies
---
&gt;... but at least make it fair and kill me in a 1v1 ...
---
Hve not encountered a horde yet that can kill anyone 1v1, that didn't have at least a 5 level advantage.
---
I am not saying they aren't out there.. but I haven't ran into them yet in classic.
---
What dungeon should I go for at level 25 as a rogue?
---
Retail bad classic good
---
taunt is melee range.
---
I like this joke
---
If your guild says you can only heal as a druid there is one of two things happening.
---
1.	You are shit at the other roles
---
2.	Your guild is shit
---
Every time I'm looking for 1 more dps, I always hope for a hunter, but only get warrior/rogue whispers 🙁
---
You can put hot peppers on a bagel? Wow.
---
WoW lore has already heavily established the concept of alternate timelines. Easy peasy.
---
I didn't know there was an Add on for class colors. what is it called?
---
What about faction specific queues?
---
Yesterday I was looking through the shared drives at work and they had a picture from the 90's of one of my bosses having a sex doll sit at their desk. Totally safe for work.

---
Call to arms to all the alliance on Kirtonos- stick in there we can beat this 2-1 ratio!
---
I disagree, I think the quests are mostly uninteresting, boring, repetitive. 
---
There's not much variety in them, no reason to really be engaged with the story.
---
FFXIV does story better, especially in the last expac. SWTOR did character development better with quests. Runescape does variety, challenge, reward better.
---
World of Warcraft's key points to me has always been their PVE raid and dungeon content, it's unparallled and they're a step above everyone else.
---
And to a lesser extent their world design, their world, and world PVP. Their arena pvp has been poorly done for awhile IMO.
---
Dont be slow then.
---
Any tips for a lvl 28 priest when it comes to world pvp? I’ve never been one for pvp, but I’d like some general tips so I can at least put up a fight.
---
Kill faster = loot faster.
---
Classic plus would be an absolute disaster. They fucked up Classic in so many ways already.
---
Yeah but i don't want to use one, much less immersive for me
---
I'm waiting to do ANYTHING other than "Collect these bear asses, boar teeth, and bird droppings for a stew" and "Deliver this mail".
---
human starting, is nothing but this. Seriously, from 10-19 so far it's just cooking and delivery service. It's really very annoying.
---
this is awesome, thanks for the hard work!
---
these drama queen healers and tanks are why I'm so glad I play with friends who aren't babies 
---
I work hard to make my healer and tank work as hard as I am. evasion up? you can bet I'm about to pull threat on something. 
---
I can't imagine actually having to wait for sunders to start dps on some leveling dungeons lol
---
My brain is going to explode if one more person acts like "classic+" and TBC are mutually exclusive. TBC already has a revenue model above the monthly subscription, level 60 characters for purchase, this is why Blizzard conducted market surveys on how much people would pay for a level 60. No one would get mad if you bought a 60, it doesn't effect the economy, and as an avid TBC druid tank, I quiete honestly demand to be given the option to buy a 58-60 druid because I'm not levelling it in vanilla and I still want to progress early in TBC. TBC is dare I say 100% guaranteed to exist, it's too lucrative not to between level 60 purchases and the generally sentiment its an AMAZING expansion.
---
Now for classic+, who knows, there's clearly a demand for the style of classic, but this is going to be a long winded journey. I personally don't believe Blizzard has the spark to create a new vanilla experience since a lot of the old guard is gone, but I remain hopeful. I also don't trust the community either. I've frequented many posts and 99% of it sounds terrible and it makes me question if I even know what I would want.
---
Still not there. Retake 😅
---
Just so you know why you are supposed to run to the tank...most people think it is because tanks are usually melee and running to them is useful, that is only half of the reason.
---
The biggest reason is that when you are considered in ranged distance away from a mob you need to do 130% threat to break aggro off of the mob, when you are in melee range you only need to do 110%. Going into melee range near the tank GREATLY reduces the amount of threat the tank needs to generate before the mob switches targets.
---
Basically every server has a good population at this point. The real problem is servers with *too many* people.
---
If you log on at primetime and pick a server at high, you can't go wrong. Either Google what timezone the realms are, or just check the in-game clock when you get in.
---
A fresh start as in a fresh economy, fresh progression, unopened AQ gates, etc. A new server starting at phase 1, or a season system.
---
TBC pls and thanks. Make it so you can server transfer from classic to BC and all will be happy. Bless
---
Stop targeting the third mob you pull. Shoot the one or mark the one you want to focus down first.
---
I thought the same, so I specced full Destro for SM/ZF.
---
From practice it was miserable as I did roughly 10% more overall AoE DPS but became absolutely garbage at soloing (questing)/grinding - would literally have to eat/drink every 2-3 pulls.
---
The Daze/Stun element is unnoticeable and the proc rates were so low that they really didn't help at all - blizzard slow was already sufficient and I didn't notice anything moving any slower. If anything, the stuns would make it so some would "stop" and fall behind the bigger pack.
---
The only big benefit was the 70% avoidance of pushback from hits, which is a godsend for channeling spells - but if you have a good Priest in your group who knows to pre-shield, it is not missed.
---
Who said that? Surely not me.
---
Yo is Grobb the biggest server now?
---
Lmao I can laugh at my Herod friends finally. Haha I knew it all along

It's definitely something that you need to be prepared for if you want to make the most (or even average) amount out of it.
---
Badlands is super dense, you can just mindlessly walk around and kill/skin everything in sight. You can try your luck with the Whelps in the east for a chance at the pet drop once you’re 39+.
---
I just stopped trying to tank and look for groups as DPS at that point, runned like 5 dungeons and on all of them had aggro problem, everyone starts dpsing immediately, worst part is when 1-2 mobs run after mage and he runs away, when rogue got crits on other guy. I'm really surprised how important aggro in vanilla, when it doesn't have any in game tools to see it. (Like % on your target)
---
I've actually really enjoyed the walking back and forth. I'm level 35, no grinding, and haven't gone to stv yet. If you plan out your zones, you can do barrens, thousand needles, stonetalon, and hillsbrad from 20-35 with 0 grinding. I'm about to head to stv now where some quests are mostly green and some yellow only.
---
Tanks will always be in the most demand except for in raiding, where the 2 slots there are super competitive and quite coveted.
---
What's a good screen share software ? I want to stream it on my laptop from my comp at home. I'm like 10000% sure that my hp stream won't be able to handle it. 
---
(I hate laptops that's why I have a shit one)
---
They are though. 
---
I dont think 40yd name plates means we will have LFR and Azurite...but as soon as you start changing anything that is related to our interactions with the world, we begin to upset the "balance" that was classic, however well or poorly balanced you believe it to be. 
---
For example, if you scrap the debuff limit, you have to buff mob health...but by how much and which mobs? a Mob in UBRS could see itself with 16 debuffs, but it likely rarely would, so it is responsible to buff the mobs in there?
---
What about a guild bank, seems unobtrusive enough, until you factor in that being (or being subjected to) a bad actor is a legitimate part of the classic/vanilla experience. Cant have good social interactions without bad ones, after all. 
---
Im not a #nochanges zealot, but players are typically the absolute worst people to ask with regards to game balance, even in a 15 year old game most players cant see further than what directly impacts them.
---
This is why I play horde. I have played both factions over the years but, horde look after their own MUCH more. They are also friendlier. Not sure why. It has shown itself to be true for years in my experience.
---
People are downvoting you but you speak the truth.
---
Running around throwing up buffs, teaming up for minor quests cause there is a bunch of mobs around, saving someone who clearly pulled too much...it is a ton of fun...
---
High five. I tanked in vanilla and loved it, tanked a bit through the years on a DK and pala. I was really looking forward to warrior tanking again in classic, but people's impatience has ruined it.
---
You and me both.  I cry when people upload to imgur.
---
You are able to set a focus target? I was under the impression this wasn't in classic as it was added in during TBC. I had not seen this option yet in my time playing but I would be interested if it was in fact possible.
---
druid tanking is just horrible at that level range, and no one gets it. i rolled druid to heal, but NO ONE wants to tank. so if i want to get a run done i have to sit through the misery. i feel you OP.
---
Seems like too much work to do on my phone are people really this balls deep they have to play when they arent home ?
---
I will try once at home. Thanks you.
---
DOTA2 has so many good liners.
---
I’m torn because I’m intrigued by the thought of new original content moving forward (after the 6th phase), but I’m also a huge fan of WotLK and would love to have the opportunity to go through that again. I absolutely wouldn’t want that to be a part of the classic we have now though, but maybe as it’s own standalone realms as has been suggested, along with a TBC set of course, which is a tall order honestly.
---
And to anyone that may think “it’s too early to start this conversation” you’re not 100% wrong. While it’s too early to want anything like these suggestions implemented, it takes a lot of time to create these things, so there’s nothing wrong with getting a head start.

Ya know, once the Classic popoulaion hits 60, you'll only find them in Ogg, IF and the BRD area. It's 0% different than TBC in that regard.

That guy didn't even whisper you a thanks, fkn dick

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12717/plans-lionheart-helm
---
Strangely enough that's NEVER been my experience. 28-37 takes me the longest per level and now that I'm high 40s I'm leveling every 3-4 hours. Many more quests and as the class I am I finally can grind mobs better.
---
This is a whole lot of assuming for something that doesn't seem to be an issue.
---
Are you reposting to cash in on all those sweet fat karma points?
---
Anything but recycled fresh servers with fresh starts, that's lazy and why would I want to put years into my characters for them to all just vanish
---
Hey now, staves are two-handed weapons and mages WILL roll on them.
---
Not to mention you guys can get that sweet sweet Axe from the Warrior Quest...
---
&gt; i think were just going onto week 4. the layering was fixed near the end of week 2. the abuse was not nearly as widespread as people were lead to believe, and the few that did abuse it are banned. 
---
This is not true. None has been banned for layer exploits. And the exploit is and still is very wide spread. Just look at /world channel for the hundreds of people asking for a layer hop. The second you ask for a layerhop you essentially exploiting layering. Obviously you can't do it that much anymore with the CD, but abuse is still there.
---
&gt;this is 100% the fault of the players themselves, and needing to be on "the best server". even now when they can switch for free they wont do it. 
---
No, people didn't pick those because they are "the best server", they picked because they had time to organize the guilds and who they are playing with. When you have 5 friends you want to play classic with, and they all have 5 other friends who have 5 other friends, it becomes very hard to find one server that fits as best as possible. And it is entirely impossible to do that with servers that aren't even out yet. 
---
&gt;back in vanilla i leveled by mostly dungeon grinding because i didnt like questing. this time it is the opposite and i only do dungeons for the quests but thats what im liking. who cares how others play. the raid xp was fixed, and for the few that managed to abuse it, OH NO they got thru 30-40 kinda quicker than usual.
---
People did not farm dungeons to level faster than hunters. That was just simply not a thing.
---
Raid exp was fixed after several guilds mass abused it to get a massive advantage by getting easier week 1 clears, and to faster abuse the unique gold advantages there is to being fastest max levels. The amount of devilsaur and black lotus farmed by those raid abusers is signficant. 
---
#
---
Thanks, it was whether impact was worth it for handling rogues. I'm not sure which class would be the biggest threat would be at 60, only have my experiences as a rogue or shadowpriest to go on.
---
You may not care about this advice, but just in the interest of full disclosure. You get cure poison from that quest, but a few levels later you can train abolish poison, a direct upgrade, without having cure learned. So that whole quest is skippable if you please.
---
Meanwhile I'm just over here getting ganked in ashenvale
---
Never missed the barrens so much
---
Thank you sir! I'd say that method could shave alot more!
---
No, that gets you a blue chest, very worth it. The we quest starts at 30 from any warrior trainer
---
If Blizz communicated that they were doing X, then months later change their mind and say no we're going to do Y, then get more data and now they're doing Z, you can sure as hell bet that it'll scare people away. Give them some time to figure it out before demanding answers.
---
I have young kids. Only interrupted one dungeon so far and only for a minute, but I can't really do much about it. Sorry guys.
---
Nope
---
probably went serpent-&gt;shit i need to trap-&gt;scorpid, 'course it didn't work because fd is shit.

Well done 😂😂😂
---
Disappointing, because this is one of the best cosplays I've ever seen.
---
Authentic looking costume. Excellent pose. Solid camerawork. And none of it relies on the cosplayer sexualizing the character.
---
And yet reddit has to drool all over the photo.
---
Dungeon grinding is quicker if done properly. There is a huge difference in XP if you're doing ZF zombie runs compared to normal ZF clearing.
---
Non-interrupted, constant flow of XP when dungeon grinding versus the travel time required, competition for mobs, low drop rate and open world PVP (if on PVP server)  for questing. 
---
I think your buddy just isn't as good at dungeon grinding as he may think he is. I'm also assuming you both started at the same time?
---
Bank alts
---
*help*
---
Haha, theses devd have a good time.
---
Awesome I’ll do that. Do you know what it’s called?
---
Ugh i hated TBC. The games became drastically more eltist imo.
---
I fucking love Feralas.
---
I don't get why people want TBC. TBC introduced many of the things people don't like about WoW today: Arena + Flying Mounts KILLED wPvP and made the world feel smaller. No 40-man raids. Shamans and Paladins on each faction like wtf? Nah I want Classic forever.
---
You might have a difficult time going fire at level 60. Most mages go Frost until their guild has cleared past BWL and moved on to AQ and Naxx. There are too many mobs immune to fire for the initial raids that makes fire a pretty suboptimal choice. If I remember correctly, fire was the top choice for pvp, though. You might have to explain to raid leaders why you won't go Frost and they'll decide from there. It also depends on your guild and their rules and how relaxed they are about dps.
---
"Balance" is what ruined the game and why retail is dying quicker by the minute and Classic is still growing.
---
Classes were created with fantasy and "utility vs output" in mind. The classes that do more damage bring less to the raid in terms of extra usefulness (for the most part).
---
I respect people that want to fully optimize, but I disagree that anyone is wasting anyone's time or being selfish.
---
There are guilds for optimization and guilds for playing the game as it was intended.
---
You're free to raid with whoever you want, and if you don't want to take less optimal specs, more power to you. But vanilla raids don't take much time either way, and if you're wiping on trash with any comp you're doing something wrong. There's also no reason to say "meme" spec and "selfish" because that's going to make people that really want to play a certain spec rethink their decisions and ultimately enjoy the game less. Just tell them "no thank you" and find someone else. There's plenty of min/maxers to choose from.
---
Or just mark mobs and stop telling people to just attack your (constantly changing) target.
---
Have you not checked the census ? The link is posted about a dozen times a day for every realm... Herod is legit like 98/2 for horde lol and I find it halarious.
---
It's a little ironic since now there's AoE farms and melee cleave groups that don't have a tank.
---
&gt;Tank usually, other healers regularly, .... ~~range~~ DPS, never...
---
Ftfy
---
Everyone has their own keybind layout. You have to mess around until you find what's comfortable.
---
For me, I change A and D to Strafe Left/Right, and use 1-6, Q E R T F G Z X C V, along with shift and alt modifiers for each. I also have mousewheel up/down/press and my two additional mouse buttons bound, along with shift and alt modifiers for them as well.
---
the quest is so close to the instance that you might as well drop it and just wait til you go.  especially since it takes up like 3 inventory spots
---
pff.. i was leveling elemental shaman :/
---
Yeah, but you can't just stay in Barrens all the way to 25. At around level 21 the quests you start to pick up are all lv 23+ and you have to go to stonetalon or ashenvale for a few levels before coming back.
---
It has a server collected, but if you click on "EU" and select PvP servers, you will see that they are motsly horde leaning
---
Yes! This question is why are you not?
---
If a prot is FCing you are doing something wrong. The entire point of an FC is to be slippery: be mobile, have self-peels. Prot war has none of those.
---
Is dungeon finder really a problem? I've never understood why people hate that so much. My biggest issues with retail are the forced repeated grinds (dailies/weeklies/mythic+/etc), epic/legendary-ification of everything (all players are basically full epic), far too many cosmetics/mounts, and class design.
---
I like almost every single quality of life update they brought into the game.
---
I dont think people understand how much we rely on the mobs hitting us to build up rage to be able to use abilities to keep aggro. You going ham before i even hit them once is going to make me play catch up for the rest of the pull which will make you have to run away or die which is gonna slow the pull down so might as well wait 10 secs to build up aggro
---
Ah, who cares? 
---
Smolderthorn Alliance was so outnumbered and basically lost bgs all the time back in TBC but it was always a great time.
---
i was hoping for the sick windfury there, was not disappointed.
---
You're my hero
---
They won't even let you kill bank alts with infernals or campfires. As of last night you can't mind control people off boats.
---
No way in hell they are going to let us corrupted blood in cities.
---
it's not. if you have a good premade group you're easily getting 50-60k exp an hour uninterrupted.
---
maybe the best of the best players can match that questing but for your average player it's very unlikely that you will consistently be able to achieve that amount of experience.
---
People just like to play video games. Calm down.
---
Diablo has seasons.   
---
And your forgetting Classic is an addition to the main retail game subscription, I think you're forgetting that. That reason alone is why Classic does not NEED new content.  
---
Thanks for the lesson in Video Games, if you where born in 98 then I was playing games when you where still in your dad's ball sack.  
---
Not everyone is like you and is entertained in the way you are.
---
This hits too close to home.
---
What is the point of this comment?
---
Not sure what your group comp was but I did my fair share of spellcleave runs with 4 mages and a healer priest. Runs are extremely fast, we would often get instance locked. 
---
Only reason I am dungeon grinding is because I've played many private servers and have experienced this several times. I just want my mage to be 60 as quickly and easily as possible to grind gold to fund my alts/twinks
---
Sorry, did my comments exceed your mental abilities? I can try to dumb things down a bit, if you prefer.
---
OP : Are there any spells that are useless to pick up?
---
You : Purge.
---
Me : Purge is not useless.
---
You : \*crickets\*
---
Thanks all for the responses!
---
Hard to say.  I have been individual pieces of gear that are slightly better then the Defias prices but I just can't do it.  I can't break the set.  I am now Defias forever.
---
Because it’s a hunter item.
---
His personality and style of comedy is why people watch him. Why you watch someone or not is subjective and you shouldn't care about anyone else's opinion on it because what he does, doesn't affect you. Just don't watch it. This post just makes it seem like they're seeking attention or the method of getting over this feeling of hatred/jealously can only be mended by others' similar opinions rather than simply ignoring it.
---
People keep starting shit on the boat between Ratchet and Booty Bay. A lot of skulls need to learn the hard way that just because I am 10 levels lower than you it doesn't mean I can't kill you.
---
Of course, after making that point I get murdered by goblin guards lol.
---
+1
---
Leveling anything other than a warrior will be easier xD
---
Okay well if it is best in slot then obv he has just amount to roll on it as anyone else
---
If only the dream that never was came to be. Can you imagine what we would have instead of SC?
---
You're not wrong, but I'm not sure why they do that when in reality is reduces rage generated which in turn is a direct dps loss because dps classes need to throttle their dps.
---
I just want tbc... but option 2 seems best
---
I have been offering mages 50s for 6 stacks of level-appropriate water (lvl 35 for me, atm...).
---
Does that sound too high, or too low, or just right?
---
Most of them seem OK with that, but I feel bad for the fresh lvl 40's that can only cast 2 at a time...  I did have one mage give up after 2 or 3 stacks and just gave it to me and asked me not to bother him again (wow, ok...).
---
That's kinda his point. Realistically it doesn't make any sense for alliance to be able to fight against Orcs, Tauren and Trolls as they'd be hilariously powerful. But in Warcraft things don't always go like they normally would. Even in the "Safehaven" cinematic you can see the forsaken rogues attacking Thrall and Saurfang. The Forsaken are just dead humans and the size and power difference is crazy, and that's after giving the forsaken some fantasy strength. If that went realistically it would've ended even faster.
---
I don’t currently have the money for that
---
This is the most important thing I think I ever learned in a dungeon. When I first started I would try to run away, now I instantly stack ontop of the tank until im no longer getting hit, then I back up to max range.
---
It has to be the linken questline, never have i ever rofld in my life about a questchain!
---
How do u get to lfg chat
---
Good god the cringe
---
Last night I was running WC. I died during the Verdan the Everliving fight. Before releasing to GY, I won the roll for Living Root. I released, but didn't get the staff. What did I do wrong?
---
Classic+ could see an opening of the Dark Portal, but rather than a revamped expansion like it was, create it with the classic feel. Add content but keep the game mechanics the same.
---
Blizz has tons of content to work with. My only gripe is TBC will add the Outlands, and I'd like to see Azeroth stay the star of the show.
---
Word!
---
That was my plan from the get aswell.
---
Always hunters.
---
This. Mark - serpent- auto.  And rank 1 AS.
---
As others said, have to land the killing blow. I would often save mind blast on mobs &lt;10% to ensure I'd get it. I also did this when healing dungeons to try to keep my mana up throughout the run
---
You'd think it's obvious but you still made this thread.  Your obsession with streamers is unhealthy, seek help.  Until then I'm blocking you so I don't have to see more streamer frothing.  Bye
---
For all those reasons and layering too. We're just lying to ourselves and still in the honeymoon phase. 
---
The good news is classic is just a fucking good game so it doesn't matter anyway. I'm all for keeping classic as close as possible to the ideal until Naxxx. 
---
But there needs to be a conversation about what direction this game heads next and vetoing every change with "but this isn't classic" isn't helpful or meaningful criticism anymore.
---
I got seeker sometime during Wrath. I went back to do Loremaster in the 1-60 zones and had to download an add-on to figure out what quests I missed because I quested my ass off at 60 and had done all but like 10-15 and had no clue what I was missing.
---
I still love questing. My wife is of your opinion, though: "I did loremaster twice, not doing that shit again!"
---
Thats kinda my point. The speed that wars level solo  is irelevent when most of the wars that were in the world first rag probably group aoe farmed to 60 with mages.
---
I know the server first 60s on my server were 3 mages, 1 war, 1 sham and they did aoe grinding almost the whole way.
---
I’ve never had a mage say no when I whisper “can I buy some food from you?”
---
I dont think there are any herbs or ores that are exclusive to one zone. Leathers yes but only one that comes to mind is devilsaur. 
---
But I dont think that would ruin a faction's economy just because it's a bit harder to farm mats. Unless a zone is constantly patrolled by enemy players, I imagine farmers will get along just fine on servers with average ratios.
---
I believe hes called shady dealer. Not poison vendor fyi
---
Yep. People blame the tank for wipes, they dps before your charge is even over, they blizzard when your still on first mob... And people wonder why there are so few tanks... Even if theres a lot of warriors, I see a lot of them unwilling to tank. And theres a good reason for it. Its the role that has the most responsibilities, and people are lazy and cant take the pressure from others for not keeping aggro or pulling too many mobs and wiping or simply being a new dungeon for you...   
---
What people need to realize is that you just tank anyway and you call idiots names because thats what they deserve for being idiots.  Hunter starts pulling? Call him a huntard. Rogue starts doing too much dps over and over again? Dont taunt and let him die.
---
Any time I can, I help out other players giving them water or food, however, that is just me, I can't speak for other mages.

I do charge for portals, 25s a pop per person or free if they provide a ruin of portals.

It’s a blizz channel, but it’s just not on by default.
---
This brings me great joy fellow pally.
---
lmao truth.  Nothing's more annoying than diva healers, especially since every "high damage mechanic" on your way to level 50 or so is trivial to brute force your way through
---
All the better for me. More gear, and honour for my druid.
---
I've had similar issues as well, but even grinding in the world is near impossible with how packed all the zones are. Finding parties takes forever, meanwhile everyone is recruiting strictly mage/warrior/priest lineups.
---
Just look at most of the raid groups already forming for MC. 50% of the DPS are mages, they top meters handily compared to other DPS and they scale better than any other class, so the gap will only widen.
---
Our only hope is slight number tweaking to make other DPS classes more viable, otherwise a lot of people are likely to unsub after a month or two. I hope class balance is one of the things Blizzard will be open about changing in classic.
---
&gt; but you’ll be far more effective at dungeons as Prot.  
---
I disagree with this assessment for the most part, as this is only true for dungeons lvl 50 and higher.  Arms gives you Tactical Mastery and Anger Management that are paramount for being able to change stances and maintain rage and to pool/maintain rage between pulls.
---
Level 51 is the earliest you would want to be full Prot, so you can still have 11 points in Arms for the aforementioned talents. And I still think waiting until 55-60 before respecing into prot is the right move.
---
For many levels, early twenties through the mid to upper 40s, it is better for the mana efficiency of the healer and overall success of the party, to use a 2h rather than sword and board.  The extra mitigation you get from armor on the shield and using shield block are offset by the fact that its nearly impossible to hold threat off of DPS with a sword and board.  Stay in defensive stance, you will use sunder primarily, revenge on proc, and maintaining demo and battle shouts. You will jump into battle and berserker to charge and intercept, or other skills as needed.  You will want to have a macro that equips a sword and shield and casts Shield Bash, and then swaps back to your 2h weapon.
---
Holding threat is the name of the game, and it is amplified by the fact that most DPS are used to the retail model of tank threat generation, where being in a tank spec gives you a 8000% increase in threat, and active mitigation is the priority.  Many DPS will try to AoE/Cleave everything, or they will attack non marked target, or they will not let the tank even finish LoS pulling the mobs, let alone wait for sunder.
---
If you have a group of five people that you are doing dungeons with exclusively, and the DPS knows they need to throttle down their threat you can absolutely make the case that prot is more effective sub 50 than arms.  But for everyone else, put your talents in the arms tree, and tank dungeons with a 2h, its much easier on everyone.
---
“Being a week or two behind” when the majority of the player base isn’t even close to level cap.
---
I'm conflicted about this.
---
On one hand, that guy is obviously a prick with no care and attention to social niceties. Seriously, in what world would his responses the way they were portrayed be acceptable? Screams immature man-child. 
---
On the other hand, I'm assuming you are trying to join an aoe lib farm group based on how you probably defended your fit in the party based on his toxic comment about blizzard. You cant complain about toxic behavior while attempting to go out of your way to join a highly elitist, xp/hr minded, antisocial leveling strategy. Seriously only the most toxic of FOMOers would sacrifice the leveling open world for grinding the same dungeon 3x per hour for 15 levels. At best you're going to get called a retard for your frost nova being 1 second too slow.
---
You can avoid these people and level with casual (in mindset) players
---
Thank you for this, this post brought me back like 15 years :)
---
it really is ;-;
---
I'm torn. On the one hand, they're not obligated to give you anything for free. On the other hand, you're grouped together, and it would only help the team. I can say that I've never charged someone for soul stoning them, or giving them a healthstone - I just do it without a second thought.
---
I hope i get promoted one day!
---
I don't know what you're talking about, the thread is still here.
---
Oh look this thread again
---
really? i dont remember that. gonna have to look for them
---
Best advice. I worry about the healer. Everyone else is expendable if they don't respect aggro.

If someone has put you on ignore in the past, but you haven't ignored them, can't they still whisper you? Is it possible this dude ignored our warlock OP in the past for whatever reason and forgot, then ran into him and asked for the buff?
---
You may wanna tank dungeons man. I hate to say it but you’re going to run into a lot of groups that would rather a priest or even a shaman/paladin.
---
Did you run to the corpse and loot the actual dead body? It won’t get sent to your inventory if you’re dead.
---
Same! I saw a Paladin corpse yesterday in a Westfall by the high level Murlocs. The guy obviously went afk because Life happened and Murlocs do what they gotta do. He hadn't released yet, so I threw him a res, hoping that popup will still be there when he got back. Paramedics unite! :)
---
Especially since it kind of defeats a big part of the point of classic.
---
It's part of the same toxic game design feedback loop that enshrines hyper-competitive min-maxxing at the cost of literally everything else.
---
Meanwhile I sheep warriors to heal them XD
---
Yeah I wanted something clean and not overwhelming like a lot of huds. I forgot to show the hidden action bar to the right that I use for utility. It pops up when I hover over
---
I keep finding low level ally plays and I stun them then /lol and run away.
---
Im not just letting anyone die... you really have to be annoying to me and the rest of the group in order for me to care enough to send a message. Heres a recent example (the only time I’ve done this in classic so far): rogue in Uldaman was constantly complaining that the clearly new tank wasn’t pulling fast enough. Meanwhile the rest of the group was trying to defend the tank and help him. The rogue then started pulling packs even though the tank asked him not to, and disregarded the rest of the group completely while also making snide comments about how useless the tank was...we get to the room with the 4 golem event and before we start I explain that when they die they explode for a lot of damage and for the rogue to move out when the mob gets low and let the ranged in the group finish it. Sure i could have just healed him through it, but he literally just cut me off and said “just click the thing ffs” and then proceeded to sit in and take all of the damage. I let him die, and I’m ok with that. It wasted maybe 30 seconds, but it made me feel better.
---
Oh don't worry, no way would I make any attempt at disproving your data. I am fully aware that it's really a perception thing that is affecting even me.
---
I feel your pain! 😭
---
I used to do that all the time as well!
---
You can still find archived versions of the OG forums, but i dont know if they exist for the entire site.
---
thats what happens when you play a 2005 game in 2019. people ONLY want to play the most optimal way
---
&gt;I just let hunter pets die if I've had to tell them to turn taunt off multiple times.
---
I love when I turn on taunt because a mob is free and wailing on the healer only to have the tank bitch at me for it...
---
Classic is all about the min max. But thats what people dont get sometimes. Youre supposed to min max at level 10 as much as you do at level 34 47 and 60.
---
Outside of BOEs, i make sure I have the best gear for every slot my character can equip. At every level. 
---
I spent an entire day farming Arm and Cath to make sure I had the helm, shoulder, gloves and pants. I help my friends get their tailoring recipes done so they have all the spell power they could want.
---
Then I go out into STV and Tanaris and fuck alliance in the mouth. I get a few quests done in the meantime, but its mostly mouthfucking of alliance. 
---
Ill hit the next level look at the quests and instance rewards available, gear up and go out again to lightly quest and heavilly kill.
---
Ill get gear at 60, there will be plenty of time for it. I suppose Im content being bis for level 42, so long as I am "in the pack" with the rest of the server.
---
Work hard and be on time and one day maybe you can browse r/new from the comfort of your work seat.
---
Main reason is that the extra hits from sword specialization or increased crit from dagger specialization in the combat tree provide much more damage in a raid setting than mace specialization (which doesn't increase your dps). 
---
At a high gear level with misplaced servo arm going deep into the subtlety tree becomes a viable option for the increased attack power talent using maces and hemorrhage. But by that time it its very late game.
---
Why dwell on something so negative. Enjoy the game and if you don’t like streamers then don’t watch them. They have absolutely no effect on you playing the game.
---
Anywhere in the north-northeast side of Wetlands. There's various fire whelps around that area between level 26-31 or so and they all have the same chance to drop it.
---
For me, content reuse is fine, but my hyjal and similar would need additional work to keep need for flying mounts away.  Add more ski lifts, some landslide areas to act as ramps or w/e
---
Holding down both left and right click also makes you immune to it
---
It’s not uncommon that the new thing that’s only a few weeks old will have higher viewership. Borderlands 2 is a great game, but the BL3 sub is most likely much more popular at the moment. Same goes for Super Mario Maker 1 and 2 subs.
---
Sometimes you gotta be that kind orc
---
Because the zones that were remade in Cata is still in the cata time.
---
Blizzard doesn't touch old content (with the exception of cata itself, and vanilla to cata is a shorter time than cata to now). So everything is just stuck in the time it was relevant in.
---
If you are leveling a DK you start out at the onset of the campaign against Arthas, then go forward in time to not just after the LKs defeat, but after the Legion's defeat as well only to immediately go backwards to before that all happened (BC), then go to when Arthas is still a threat, then back to the time after his defeat (But now Varian is still alive!).
---
It's a bloody mess
---
&gt; The game population is slowly tapering off as predicted
---
Yeah dude its not like some of us took 1-3 weeks off work just to play the game and have to return to life.
---
my server grobbulus seems to be alliance dominated but honestly i wouldntve been able to guess either way.
---
&gt;Retail became a failure
---
There's no to be fair here, you take the free food and suck it up, not /spit and act like a dick.
---
If you don't like it don't participate or read the discussion?  Mind-blowing that this needs to be pointed out.
---
People enjoy discussing something they're passionate about.  People are passionate about WoW.  If that's not something you can handle then maybe a subreddit specifically for fan discussion isn't the place for you to be.
---
Are you on a PVP server? If so, that's just the app recognizing that STV is a desolate waste of ganking and getting ganked and there's no right path.
---
The meat of the game is the levelling. It starts at level 1.
---
You may have a point, it's hard to know exactly.  But still, classic subreddit has ~ 4.6x more people actively viewing.  With that large a discrepancy I feel it's still fair to say that classic is currently much more popular.
---
The content of your post was removed you fucking scrub.
---
Obligatory Thigh Inquisitor comment passing through
---
The three option post was dishonest as it presented "true classic" to be a periodic character wipe.
---
It does get better especially at 40 if you are arms. If you get axe especially you generate threat a lot more from the increased dmg and Crit
---
My friend's comments and posts are not showing up in this sub. They are showing up to him, but no one else can see them - I've confirmed this from my account.
---
He's messaged the mods twice, but no response. Could this be anything other than a shadowban? Any ideas?
---
Btw, I looked at his comment history, there are only a few comments, all content related, nothing anyone would consider shadow ban worthy, if that is what happened.
---
3 minute mage
---
Is he alliance or horde?
---
&gt;Can we also see some data that says why other expansions don’t flourish with a 50/50 ratio? So many statements in this post sound like nonsense with no sources to back them up
---
Just play on any TBC private server, and you can see for yourself, most of them are having to use faction queues to force people into playing alliance, or give them free goodies like free epic flying mounts etc.
---
Hehe thats funny :D
---
The people who talk about clown suits clearly never played BC.
---
I know i'm in the process of getting str/stam gear right now, i get declined alot but this is the first time i've been kicked like this.
---
Why do you even care about any of the streamer stuff?
---
&gt;Like, i just thought everyone always killed greenskin and Van cleef before cookie and just dropped off the top deck after.
---
I had a couple groups fuck that up and pull too many adds - so now I just go the other way without asking. 
---
It's a tiny bit slower but its safer and easier.

like Paladin Raid MT easy? (Not meme'ing)

You know you'd have to leave your house to do so, right?

What if we all just played the original beta test and jerked off each other for being so hardcore and spending 90 minutes on each 20 meter movement.

Love it
---
I hope they can find a way. Osrs was totally dying until they began adding new content.
---
But why's the dmg different?

This could be interesting with multi boxers. Just picture a 5-boxer lining up his characters just right with the names Chugga,, Chug, CH, OO, CHOO with the train sound in the background just tearing up a battleground.

Ay nice build man, I think I’ll follow it

ITs not vanilla enough. My Infernal should destroy Gold Shire! Not despawn from it!
---
Because there is a not insignificant group of people who go to PVP servers just to make themselves feel better than someone else. These are the same people who screech obscenities and then drop group on the first wipe in a dungeon.
---
Enhance shaman are so friggin fun.  It's just a goddamn shame that they are really bad in PVE once things actually get difficult and you need to max and min.  They simply do not scale like rogues and warriors do with gear.  The utility they bring (totems) can be accomplished by the better spec of theirs as well (restoration)
---
I'm looking forward to TBC simply because they made enhancement shamans so much more viable in pve and I can't wait to reroll an alliance one.
---
They are good for dungeon farming because they are tanky as heck
---
They're top dps beginning in MC with proper gearing.
---
The latter of your suggestions is the more accurate one. It is just a meme based on the heavily opinionated meta that druids are only allowed to be healers at 60. There is much more flexibility for hybrid roles in a raid group than you would think.
---
That's an interesting and helpful sub. He did a test post there, says he is not shadow banned, but does say that his recent posts have been removed - possibly automatically.
---
They actually list those comments, so you can see how benign they are: https://old.reddit.com/r/ShadowBan/comments/d3tinc/sb_test/
---
Unless his comments redirecting low effort meme posters to the wowmemes sub were flagged as spam...
---
I assume contacting the mods is the only resolution?
---
To use summoning stones you still needed people there in the first place.  Someone still has to wade through the pvp.  Three someones in fact.
---
As a warlock I never *had* to go to the dungeon first - I  *could*
---
go and provide a service.  It's a perk to the class, just like portals are to mages.  Adding NPCs/static objects to do what players offered before dumbs down the game.
---
Might as well just have npc hirelings to fill out your entire party and not rely on people altogether.
---
Then again, you want the core gameplay experience changed so we're not going to see eye to eye either way.  The whole point of #NoChanges is that what players 'want' doesn't actually make for a good mmo.  There's supposed to be fighting and teamwork chores - that's what makes the game social.  You can either dread them or use them as opportunities to communicate and BS, make experiences, etc.  
---
Summoning people is a part of the reason why a non insignificant amount of lock players chose lock over mage. It's a really strong team utility in a world without instant teleportation.
---
Yea I really dont want a very vocal minority of players leading the direction of the game.
---
I can do all guildy runs and never have a single issue with anyone pulling threat, the healer doesn't go OOM every other pull, and we can clear SFK or similar content in like 35-40 minutes. 
---
Not trying to sound like an ass here but...
---
If you're pulling agro as a DPS, and the tank is even remotely competent, that's your fault, not theirs. If I'm 2-3 hits into a mob, and I don't miss like 4 attacks in a row, you'd have a hard time pulling that mob off me without using a taunt, or spamming earthshock and using rockbiter as a shaman (which are basically their "taunts")
---
Trust me when I say, have some patience, auto attack, and let the group work effectively as a group, instead of forcing the healer to spend all their time saving DPS, and the tank spend all their time playing catch up. Your runs will go so much better if you give each pull time to develop...
---
So far I've only had 1 DPS die in an instance I've tanked, and we've had 0 wipes... but 1 WC run took like 2.5 hours because we had to stop after almost every pull for the healer to catch up on mana, cause he was spending it all on an arms warrior that wanted to hold agro and OT every pull... and another WC run took like 1.5 hours (because that's a long fucking instance) but we 4 manned it with 3 druids and a mage (Bear/Cat/Heals/AOE) and it was an absolute dream. We used almost no CC, and the mage would let me grab the group, generate some rage, spam swipe a few times, and then just blizzard everything down in a group. It was beautiful.
---
spec feral and have healing gear for dungeons. you dont gain that much more healing wise and you can quest fine. issue is youll be buying spells for both whereas I am just getting feral skills (for cat) and mandatory balance/resto spells.
---
30/0/21 is balance/resto...
---
ELI5 the farming you mean. Wouldn't you just need to get it once?
---
Yes, it’s pretty difficult for tanks to keep aggro at low levels, especially with a taunt. Most tanks know this; just help out the tank but focusing down one at a time and not DPSing until they pull first. 
---
Not really, if they have excess mana or can wand it helps.
---
Na we cool with it.
---
How about that disease from the silithids in Un'goro? That one is pretty aggressive. 43% increased physical damage taken for 30 minutes is awful.
---
&gt;There is also an overuse of AoE, IMO. Like, yeah, ok, there is a group of three mobs, so blizzard, hellfire, etc might make sense, but it's still going to be FASTER to focus fire the mobs down individually
---
Three is the magic number where my Blizzard is more damage than my single target spells right now. Plus, I only have to push Blizzard once every 8 seconds vs Frostbolt every 2.5.
---
You kill plenty.
---
On some sources. On others it's more like 55/45. None of the censuses are very accurate.
---
Strange, cause it has certainly been mine lmao
---
1) Yes, depending on the aggro value of the tank. Things like taunt increase these taunt values to try and make sure dps does not pull aggro. If that is on cooldown, or if they dont have a taunt, dps should try and meter their output as to not pull aggro.
---
2) Not necessarily. They can wand when pulling trash mobs, but making sure no one dies is top priority with any pull.
---
meanwhile rogues and hunters are both doing better than mages in MC so far and warlocks are required for all raids.  The only things that really are gonna be out in the cold are the stupid meme specs like ret pally and balance druid.
---
I feel like the ideal situation is release the expansions, and during the next six years while we are going through that content blizzard can work on a WoW 2 that continues the story after WotLK (and retcons everything post WotLK). Of course what WoW 2 could/should be is a whole other conversation...
---
There will be less of them in a couple months when there are many less people leveling
---
You can't just master loot the ring to anyone inside the instance?
---
Yes every person in the party has threat! Pulling too much DPS raises your threat which makes the mob more likely to attack you. Make sure to use threat drops in your dps rotation, or just let the tank establish Aggro first.
---
Healers aren’t expected to do much dmg, but definitely can help out when everyone is topped off and you have plenty of mana.
---
Yes and yes.
---
However, the healers should only be doing damage if it is a reasonable time to do so. As a priest, I usually lay down a couple DoTs and then just heal and wand in between heals. 
---
Don't waste your mana damaging if it is going to cost someones life.
---
Hey guys, I have inly received Blizzard response regarding the use of this command.
---
&gt; Game Master Urndanorm here to help you out. Thanks for taking the time to contact me today.
---
I hear you had some questions about a cvar command that sets nameplate distances at a different distance in game and if it was something that's okay to do. Making sure that things are running smoothly is important, and feeling like you might get in trouble for something you want to try out in game is never fun. I wanted to dive into this with you and see what we could find out.
---
This particular setting was broken in the WoW Classic beta but appears to be working in the current live client. I would not recommend using scripts in game to exploit the game and gain an advantage over other players since that is a violation of the ToS.
---
*So if you are using this, at your own risk... *
---
Yup, I've had to do similar things. I like to pack my bags and find an extremely secluded area with humanoid mobs to farm. Even then, my server is still usually full and even those areas are often shared with others.
---
Does it only apply to epic mounts? My swag warhorse doesnt do it either.
---
That's good to know. I did wailing caverns last night and dismissed it out of caution. And a vague memory of hearing about pets aggroing entire dungeons
---
Ok. That was pretty good.
---
Yeah you don’t get the new food until 32 or 34 I forget. When I’m making 2-4 at a time due to level, I remind people how many I can make each time so they know what’s going into it.
---
It's closer to 65/35 but ya.
---
Yeah,i used "because" a little too much,but this is not a reddit about the english language,so who cares.Everyone understands what i want to say perfectly,so its okay.
---
Yes on DPS
---
No on Healers, but some do if they feel they have a handle on keeping up with the damage
---
It’s because AOE groups need power word shield to avoid getting dismounted during big pulls.
---
The guild I joined through an irl friend is like that, people whove been playing retail and have everything figured out to a t. Hyper efficient, and running anything with them is a chore, because its basically just a spreadsheet grind. 
---
Already looking for a different guild that wants to play a game, rather than powergame it
---
wait i looked away for one second where'd the dwarf go?
---
It means your server is too full and they want you to populate another server.
---
On my server horde and alliance are all over the rock elements nuts all day. And if you are lucky enough to get one you get swarmed by horde.
---
Yeah those certainly wouldn't be shadowban worthy. I'm honestly not sure. I don't know enough about how comments are removed on reddit and what could be causing that.
---
I just use the global data that's continually updated not just a screen shot of Friday night or whatever
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler's Use effect has 3 charges. After that, its just a stat stick. You need to have a bag full of them going into raid night.
---
I just wanna use the burst in the most crucial times in BGs. For example - That flag carrier kill we need to put the game away, nuking the last defender at a base we need to take in AB to seal the win, etc.
---
This is probably the worst one I have ever encountered. Thankfully I'm a paladin this time around.
---
Anytime you get a new version while leveling and a random asks for water just make the previous version.  Same with food.
---
If they make a fuss for whatever reason you can either ask for money to make stacks 2 at a time, tell 'em you haven't got a new rank yet, haven't gone back to train yet or you couldn't afford it.
---
I play on a west coast server which allows me to play “peak 7-11”  pm from 10-2.
---
Fucking metric system.
---
Or he can just make his own group...with blackjack and hookers. I mostly heal now as druid  and most toxicity I see is between dps.
---
TBC or bust for me as well. Hopefully WotLK next. Stop there.
---
Can you log into the website and check recent activity. Anything off there? Check your account info and see if your email still matches, etc.
---
&gt;I'm not sure how it is faster in any way.
---
It's faster if the tank actually holds them and you have imp blizzard to keep them slowed. If things get loose its slower. 
---
Basically, bring a Paladin to give Blessing of Salvation, preferably a tank with Consecrate, or don't bother.
---
Shh. We need others to spec into improved motw so we don’t have to! :p
---
Blizzard
---
Looking back, I wish they would have enforced that from launch, now its too late to put in any kind of faction que.
---
The best solution would be to give free transfers from servers which has surplus of one faction to try to balance out the ones which are very uneven.
---
I see my server with 37% alliance which offers free transfers right now to a server with literally 50/50. Thats not something they should be doing imo, instead they should just monitor the balance and have limited transfers from my servers horde and some other server alliance population, so people don't transfer away and fucks the server ratio up even more.
---
There are websites that have tons of weakauras people have already made that serve a huge range of purposes. https://wago.io/classic-weakauras
---
You'd wanna look at paladins specifically.
---
Once you import them, you can tweak them and move them around to your liking.
---
It's a good starting point if making your own is daunting.
---
I can go at a fast pace and I can regen plenty to do quite a few in a row. But I just need a quick 20 seconds from time to time. Especially if a tank doesn’t know how to properly use their rotation of shield block...etc
---
Oh damn, you are right, THIS is the correct link. I will edit the first post, thanks a bunch!
---
How confusing!
---
Is this water quality in Classic?
---
So basically "pussycock" or some other off the cuff vulgarity.
---
So yeah, it was a little odd. There is no DC on the interface/addon options. Hour of google later, I found these that worked. (So I just made a macro)
---
&gt;/console actioncam on

Ohhhh dude
---
I ran a group last night with somebody 10 levels higher than the rest of us. I was still getting mad good exp. Dunno about any calculators.
---
Healing is relatively easy. I do it full shadow spec at SM right now. By all means heal a lower instance but you can do perfectly fine at regularly leveled instances for you.
---
It's 2:1 H:A according to the census addons.
---
IIRC it was added at the same time as BWL, so that's probably why it's being delayed until phase 3.
---
... no.
---
The translations of Vanilla weren't good. Over time they actually got excellent translations with the newer expacs.
---
No Hunter traps in combat REEEEEEEEEEEEEE FIX PLS
---
Also a designer here. Yup.

That was the case for me until recently when I started doing zones with fewer enemies that both factions have quests for, like Badlands Reagents Run (the condor parts are impossible to get due to the drop rate and competition), and Study of the elements: Rock (the lesser elementals have a low drop rate and are always heavily camped by horde if not horde and alliance).  People generally dont want to make groups for those quests because it takes you longer since you are already capped by number of mobs you can kill and people don't share drops.

You have to understand that most people that play classic are shit, especially those that circlejerk about it like this post.  
---
They have not stepped outside of LFR and RDF.
---
If you're a pve player sure. But then you don't get the good pvp gear.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Yea lol dudes an asshat
---
Classic is about enjoying the journey. Go run all the quests you missed, game some gold and rare drops to sell on AH as economy matures. Level your skills. Do some fishing. Grind rep with other cities. Literally a shit ton of stuff you can do.
---
Though I've never followed blizzard like I have Jagex, I doubt that -
---
&gt; The guys with the good ideas are gone
---
Sure many probably are, but in the case of Jagex when they released OSRS then started putting together a dedicated team for it, some people who'd been at the company for years were extremely excited to get to work on the old version. These people for the most part knew the community and what was and was not good for the game. 
---
Of course this also mainly worked because not only did the developers and workers that went to the team love the game for how it "should" be/of been. They were allowed to do things differently with some exceptions here and there. (also a polling system has been a huge help though even that has its ups and downs.)
---
I'm sure blizzard has some people that if given the chance would make some good changes. The changes could/should be small at first of course. Like making meeting stones work or maybe a slightly better chat system for finding groups for dungeons that is also global and easy to use/learn about for new players. This would be a small change, not messing with "core vanilla social mechanics" that would aid in the QoL of getting a dungeon party together.
---
I know they have the phase plan and honestly it's smart. They can slowly release old, already existing content and keep the game fresh for longer without HAVING to develop anything extra. However I'm sure some QoL changes could be made so long as core aspects were not changed.
---
Just in case people over agree or disagree with me based on their experience with the game and where they started from or assuming where I started from. I played for about 2 weeks back in Wrath, made a come back with some friends for 2 months in MoP (fucking pandas...friend clicked on the wrong faction) then came back for another couple months again in WLoD. I then did not play till a few days after classic launch. So that's my experience with WoW. I miss LFG but understand why it was bad for the game.
---
Fill the guild with friends so there is always people on, and when you run with people ask them to join and offer help when you’re available.
---
But my point is that there's multiple census sites constantly updating their data and for the most part they don't really match up.
---
Ending is perfection
---
Wait, this was allowed? I remember trying the commandand was already unavailable at launch, am I crazy? I thought it sucked because I play a Priest, but since I didn't use it I guess it's not that big of a deal at this point.
---
Just ignore mana. Your spells do almost no damage anyway, just occasionally drink to have mana for FD.
---
And it is a huge problem for us warriors. If I can’t get rage I can’t produce threat, if I can’t produce threat the mob won’t be hitting me, giving me even less rage. 
---
The only rage that happens is real life.
---
We have to talk about that simply because the day will come that blizzard will have to make a decision and would help a lot if the players helped talking about it now.
---
People don't like when other day this but it's true: players ruined wow, blizzard were handing everything players wanted but players know shit, so we got retail like it is now
---
In this particular case the warrior didn't bring a ranged weapon. When the hunter started pulling he started complaining.
---
Drinking and playing is our guilds favorite pasttime :)
---
Yea but moonglow is deep balance unlike ooc
---
You make another toon and do it again, gaining twice the money in the process, once done you now have an account, transferring gold and items between 60s and treating either toon as an extension of the other. That's no lifing.

I was in SM yesterday with a PuG of 4 guys in the same guild. Right before the Lib boss they kicked me and said it was because I needed on a helm earlier that one of them wanted and they knew they would be able to 4 man the boss.

They just kept me around to help clear trash. Fuckin' ass hats.

Yes it was, restricted to 20 yards. Now it is fixed in classic to also make sure it is at 20 yards max.

This, frost is only good if you want to solo aoe farm. Fire is fun as hell. Even in the meta aoe group comps a good speced fire will out dps everyone as long as another mage has imp blizzard. The hundreds of *guides* and dozens of *streamers* have ruined any creative mindset most people should have in this game, especially this early.
---
Either a bug (report it) or there's something about those particular mobs. Also depends on what level you are compared to them.
---
&gt; Or you could not be a cheap skate peasant and BUY your own water from a vendor. 
---
I can flip that around and say, The mage shouldn't be a greedy fucktard and charge for something that only cost him about 10 seconds of time....especially when you consider that the summoned food and water dissappears after you log out.
---
If it persisted, then I'd probably pay for it.  I sure as fuck wouldn't pay 10+ silver for a stack of it.  The AH will see to it that a stack would cost a silver, if that.....
---
I just made a separate tab that has trade and lfg enabled and swap to it when i feel like dealing with idiots.
---
Don't worry, Blizzard knows that the casual players pay the bills. If you read interviews and behind the scenes accounts, this is reiterated over and over.
---
Tanks.  Honestly I haven’t noticed a shortage of healers while leveling up meanwhile tanks can take awhile to get.
---
Is Quartz supported on classic? I haven't seen a compatible version so far.
---
your waifu trash - wow version
---
It's the opportunity cost of not being a mage.  Rogues can open boxes for free, and it's considered shitty to not give anything.  Warlocks can summon people.  A mage can spend 20 seconds pressing a button, and you can spend 20 seconds killing that thing over there for some silver.
---
You've got like 2+ years dude. No one's rushing you just because they're discussing what the direction might be post-Naxx.
---
Gools Fold
---
Yeah I assume were talking about a level where he's limited by his spells available
---
Additionally you will drainlife for more giving you effectively more health and mana due to how warlocks utilize drain life, siphon life, and life tap
---
I suppose you never finished Razorgore then, or at least not until level 70.  
---
It was never in the 1.12 client and is not present in 1.13.
---
Once you've unlocked Cheapshot/Kidneyshot/Blind you have most of your final tools at your disposal.  So the playstyle won't shift greatly between 37-60.
---
That is a really rough comparison to make and the words are in no way related the way you think they are
---
Black santa!
---
As long as you're willing to farm mcp you'll lever have threat issues.
---
One scenario, OP could've been acting up on general chat and the guy just put him on ignore then.  Op wouldn't have any idea until they unexpectedly meet on this chance encounter.
---
I had been just throwing up anything everything at very reasonable prices... but so little is selling that im actually losing money from deposits. 
---
The only reliable sells seem to be ore and cloth. Even quality blue weapons at crazy low prices are being ignored because everyone is hoarding gold.
---
As a healer, I prioratize the tank above even myself. If DPS is fucking shit up, I will let them die to prevent a wipe.
---
If they will be at least green when you hand in then you will get full exp. You're probably better off doing WC though to get gear.
---
This was the absolute coolest thing and i never got to do it.... Please bring back blizz.
---
For most of the fights you usually need like, 1 deep prot warrior, 2 max, and the rest can be DPS spec with some tank gear.  There are a lot of fights and pulls with many adds but the reasons for going full tank spec don't really kick in till a raid boss is punching you in the face.
---
A DPS warrior with a certain amount of health can easily  tank raid trash/adds.  This will benefit the raid when the adds start falling and the warrior w/ nothing to tank can now switch weapons to go DPS and go ham on the next target, snowballing to the boss.

---
Actually you misunderstood me. It feels better to win when you know you’ve made good choices. For example by predicting how long the fight will last and balancing your spirit, with casting pauses and clever use of game mechanics to cast free spells, or only spending mana on one particular spell because it’s more efficient than any other spell, with expensive stuff mixed in when you feel like you have mana to spare. I hate the word rotation to begin with. I want to choose which 100 buttons I will press during the fight, where to spend mana and where not to. Forcibly pressing a button every 1,5 second is not fun to me and never feels rewarding, regardless of how difficult is your 1112113 rotation. 
---
Vanilla and TBC were incredibly punishing for noobs and you will see that soon once we get to 60 (or if they add another expansion to 70). Following a rotation is easy. Judging every single element in the game for your dps and balancing your mana with your threat and cooldowns is a whole different story. 
---
Regarding the playing with your mind part, in tbc I knew I had won a duel often 30 seconds before even winning it, while the opponent was at full hp. If he blinks at the wrong time, or trinkets the wrong thing, experience would make it so that you could destroy them with a perfectly calculated plan which didn’t require good reflexes or spamming buttons fast enough. Good players knew which ability could be used to counter which ability. They fish for certain situations and then execute the plan they had all along. After wotlk’s nukefest, this was no longer the case. 
---
You could fish for those abilities with well executed skilled maneuvers, like predicting what they will do, or with fake casts, or quick reflexes, or using their deadzone, or gouging their blink, or swd-ing a freeze trap, or whatever, but the bottom line was that it all came down to who made better use of their resources. If you outplayed someone else, by definition you would make them waste their resources which would lead to a victory. This stopped being true in wotlk and later, since resources and cc became endless, burst punishing regardless of how outplayed you got during the duel. Overall the changes were disappointing, clearly made to benefit casuals who want to win sometimes.
---
I mean, feelsgoodman and everything, but the chances of this happening are astronomically low.  Fishing for karma seems more likely than the odds of this happening.  Just my two cents though, bring in the downvotes.
---
hol up

Happened a few times :) They changed their nicks but remember everything about me since 2005-2008

I did similar but for a team of twinks my friends and I were making. So many leather classes - and lots of great gear from it. Of course the belts too!

Couldn't wait to go back this time around and really impressed at least 1 dude in my group with the confidence and routing! Feels good man.
---
I didn't even think of that, thanks. 
---
Maybe it will help me understand it more too.
---
no they aren't...they are pretty much the best or 2nd best ranged dps every raid all the way through.
---
Let the battle begin
---
They eat anything as well.
---
we were the same lvl. im 57 and the mobs were aswell. 
---
i noticed that quite often. in the ud starting zone my lvl 2 mage got sometme just about 7xp per mob while they normally givve me about \~40 per kill.
---
Like the guild name, big fan of Bob Ross.

What does Osrs have thats against old-school spirit? The worst thing I can imagine is the ge. Which was already being provided by third party websites anyway.
---
You speak as if I've never been in a raid before lol
---
Yes lol, Lvl 50 Hunter kited him to SW
---
I'm a tank and also hate this aoe meta.  I have yet to group with a mage that does not insist on using Blizzard or spamming Arcane Explosion if I pull more then ONE mob.
---
lol this is funny to me because I had the exact opposite happen to me this morning.
---
I, a 42 warrior was fighting elementals in arathi. I had about half my hp at the time, mob was almost dead, and a 35 shaman runs up behind me with like 70% of his own health and starts to fight me. 
---
I just pop recklessness and with a white crit and mortal strike, dust him in two hits.
---
I mean with a 7 level difference, what was he thinking??
---
I'm guessing blizzard's internal length system on both is the same, so (for WoW) 1 yard = 1 meter.
---
Technically she has to do what you command. And now I'm out before this thread really goes south. Just like a succubus if you command it.

Apparently I do.

Frost Shock slows and lasts as long or longer than daze thats why you use Frost Shock for PvP.

---
Wpvp, duels, solo content, farming, decent heals in pve, pretty good tank and melee dps.

I think the retcon of Draenei design was a bad move. Instead of using the ones from WC3, they pulled a design out of nowhere and said "oh yeah those ugly ones you remember from WC3? They're broken and we fixed em"

You so lucky he missed/you dodged concussive. Rogue life never goes that way versus hunters.

---
Hunters can be good DPS if they have full t2, chromagg bow, all the good rings/ necklace, multiple clicky trinkets, etc.  But even then, you gotta be a good ass player and you'll still only hit top 5-10 DPS and be beat by a bunch of mages YOLOing frostbolt or melee classes stacked to the roof.  And you're a constant meme so all the good multi-class loot will go to rogues/ wars before you get your dirty hands on it.  -- source, played pservers as a hunter

Anyone familiar with questie?
---
The quest tracker on screen when I load in is default set to the center of my screen (instead of being under the minimap) and I cant move it. There is no option under questie to unlock it so it can move or an option  to set its placement. I've tried resetting questie, all different types of click on it and dragging, checked and used every setting option, google searched and even uninstalling and reinstalling.

Wait, you're telling me people can do that? I see lfg channel being spammed nonstop by all archetypes looking for same dungeon. Everyone is lazy or dont want to put in the work.

---
No I didn't. You spoke as if you've never been in a raid before. Not tryin to be a dick, just saying.

---
We got a high IQ over here fellas.
---
I agree. And as I've said elsewhere, maybe I'm not explaining myself well. 
---
It's not the exploration based, slow paced, "take in the world" questing I have an issue with. It's the complete lack of variety of imagination WITHIN the quests. The fact that 95 percent of them are the same thing with different quest text.
---
I don't care what you think, we disagree and whatever choice we make is a personal choice, not written in stone.
---
The graph you posted still shows that TBC/WOTLK were pinnacle of the game.  
---
Burning the world down in cataclysm may have been a bad thing and i'm not debating that.

Real question though, are you willing enough to trust someone over the internet enough to do this.  At some point there will be a breakdown.  That's how a lot of the major wars in EVE Online start.

Shes super new so this might turn into a very good tip! We'll see if I run my intended char there or just roll one with her that I can use as a bank alt later.

Unfortunately it's not the exact same. Shaman's can "Far Sight Hop." That is, they can cast from that new location, Hunters can only do the first hop.

...what?
---
I'm saying if you don't truly need the item, as in you're going to equip it immediately upon receiving it and/or as soon as you can equip it, then just greed roll or pass.
---
Need rolling should only be for an item you will actually use immediately.
---
It takes time to develope something. So if anything should be ready in 2 years, Blizzard will start soon.
---
More challenging content? Set items that change the way your builds work? There's options to solve that too. Everything doesn't have to be just more and more stats and bigger numbers.
---
Take my upvote for the feeling of community. Also, I wanted to hang myself from my priest robes when I gained half a level on one kill quest because apparently not all mountain lions have blood in their veins. In fact, only 1 in 10 do.

Call it whatever you want, fact of the matter is nobody hit max level 2 weeks after release.

The average player took months to hit max level. If you blitz through everything this phase has to offer in 2 weeks that’s in you.

What the fuck, 15 years of this game and I never saw this before...
---
This only became a thing post WoTLK. 
---
With TBC, if you had naxx gear, it was on par with, if not better than Kara gear. 
---
T6 was better gear than blues from wotlk leveling. My pally was rocking full t6 until I started to get Naxx drops.
---
This change wasn't immediate in wows design, but it's definitely as bad as its ever been. I'm pretty sure one raid tier now completely erases last raid tiers gear, but I haven't played in ages.

Libram**
---
I would say it crosses the line for me when it affects people that it shouldn’t. Everything he does is through his stream at this point. Anything he is “ninjaing” is from his guild that know who he is and what he does. If he was in a pug and was doing this kind of shit then yeah. Total asshole, but that’s not the case.
---
Trust me u wouldn’t like it, in retail i get my spells for free but in classic they showed me I have to pay for them? Weird..
---
But is a word that is seldom used to start a sentance, however, it can be done.
---
Yes, although sometimes I just go to duskwood instead of stonetalon because stonetalon makes you walk way too much.
---
Your view is correct and does not need to be changed. How important gold is in Classic: WoW and the amount of gold that a BOE can sell for makes it just as valuable to someone that wouldn't use it.
---
It's not as simple as mount money. Gold is valuable across the board. That BOE epic can net enough gold for you from the AH to buy an actual BOE from the AH you would use.
---
&gt;worried about item obsoletion with new content
---
&gt;Wants an expansion that will replace most of your gear with quest items
---
It’s really not, to be fair.  At the very least it’s atypical.  It’s meme’d in chat nonstop on retail and if you played classic it’s probably the most iconic weapon.
---
Good luck mate enjoy working harder to be weaker than any other druid choice in pvp
---
So if someone actually needs a valuable BoE to use, trade it to them afterwards.
---
That's a shitload of speculation.
---
Yooooo I seen that a bit ago on the forums and thought it was sick, I checked her insta and it was an insta follow. Talented doesn’t even describe her and her crew. They are phenomenal.
---
It happens all the time. You get stacks of something called determination which is a multiplier for your health and damage after a certain point. It is very common to see those climb to 10 or so stacks.
---
As a hunter myself I don't use this feature at all I was just using tracking. And I have to say I found it much more fun and full of danger.
---
I liked those quests when they were rare. I'll take silly gimmicks as long as I'm not doing them twenty quests in a row.
---
This is where you can get that great fishing pole too right?
---
Hey man, if you're gonna strawman, at least put effort in.
---
haha
---
I've also never understood. If there's a white dice and everyone has equal chance it's fucking roll time bitches
---
If it's a guild that's making a small % on transaction fees? Ya I'm going to trust them. They are making gold off of it.
---
You're wrong, because private server min/max groups brought rosters where 90% of the DPS was mage/warrior. It isn't just a levelling issue, it's also prevalent in pre-raid dungeons, raids and PVP.
---
I don't think the other classes should receive more utility, just some light number tuning to bring their DPS in line with mages for raids/dungeons.
---
That was apes tho, a private server guild who has been running the raid for over 5 years. The average guild going into MC with no experience will struggle at the beginning and need all 40 people performing at their best.
---
Sometimes it takes a while. Just make sure you are doing something else. LFG is a global channel, so searching for a member for an
---
hour isn’t a big deal if you’re out questing during that time. 
---
Standing in front of the instance spamming LFG is a bad idea.
---
Once again, economics 101.  Profession materials begin to rise first.  Why is this?  Imagine the entire populace competing for nodes in one layer, instead of just 3,000 you have 30,000 people, all competing for trusilver, mithril, lotus, etc.  Side effect : Profession goods explode in cost, massive demand supply exhausted.  (If you thought waiting for a quest mob was bad...)
---
After this rise and it becomes unaffordable to consume, Non crafted items begin to rise in cost as the haves and have nots begin separating themselves economically.  Buy outs and market control strata begin taking over all facets of the player market.
---
This cycle continues through the economy endlessly until supply and demand can coexist.  Gold income stagnates for all and basic goods either have a value of copper or a value of thousands of gold for a single flower.  Your revenue stream doesn't change from mob kills as CoL has increased eroding all benefits of higher gold value of goods and saving even your ability to repair.  A simply purchase of a flask could bankrupt you, your only income is based on RNG, or hoping you can kill enough to vendor items and cover repair bills as mob drops remain unchanged.
---
As I said, it's basic economics.
---
I guess, while being downvoted even. Haters gonna hate.
---
out of curiosity, what are you paying for a stack of summoned water that disappears when you log out?
---
Probably be fine. Get one or two more levels if you wanna be safe

The fucking irony.

---
At they really that weak in 1.12? Should I play warrior if I want to PvP with a melee class with a high skillcap?
---
Pretend you’re afk like I am, works 100% of the time.
---
rage is like an investment man.  You have three investment opportunities.  One gives you 3.4%, one gives you 3.5%, one gives you 3.6%.  Do you really want to go with the lowest one just because you like the letter head or the logo better?  
---
Even as a human axes are better.  You get more crits, more deep wound damage (this talent is directly related to the weapon damage) and your rage is being spent dealing more damage with the slower speed axe.
---
There are plenty of items I need on my warlock but I would 100% sell anyway
---
In coordinated groups it makes more sense NOT to have the tank pull. A hunter or mage, in addition to applying CC, can LOS pull casters and other ranged mobs right to the tank. Only the initially tagged mob has any hate, so a simple shout or whatever will grab them.
---
Haaaahaaaaaaahaahahaha
---
I've never played wow before. How should I know?

Much more imo. Less travel but way more frustrating farm. Super worth it though
---
Well now we’ve gone from a dps accidentally ripping aggro to someone who is intentionally trolling the group.
---
Go for it!
---
So then don't do that? It's BoE, the only time you are being a ninja is *when you are actually ninja looting*.
---
If someone else doesn't roll need, and rolls greed, what do I tell them? /roll, and if they beat me, I trade it to them.
---
If someone says they actually need, and will equip immediately to prove they're not going to AH it, I'll give it to them.
---
I trust myself to not dick over other players. I don't trust randoms to have the same level of egalitarianism.

Grobb did this too yesterday lol

It doesn't say this at all

Splitting the playerbase is bad.

You sure you can hop with Eagle Eye? I remember not being able to in BC, but maybe I was just a bad.

Yeah you can, you’re on the low end, and that will have consequences, but you can do it. I did it with an 11 priest. It took forever and we died a lot, but we completed the instance.

Ahh am I completely wrong or is there a word like that that you are not supposed to use.. maybe “and” idk why I feel so like there was a rule to this but also I hated English class because of all the “rules” of English

I love osrs so I would love to see new exclusive content and release of the next expansions. Or for the new updates to add some of the stuff come later expansions but add it within the current one
---
What are they gonna do, make him lurk more?
---
Read that in David Attenborough's voice
---
&gt; Is it so hard for us to ask for Parallel content to be added? Why does Y have to replace X? And then Z replace Y next addition? Why can’t there just be more? Why can’t there just be different? Give us a sword with the same DPS, make them look different, make one increase attack speed, make one do something fancy, the limits are bound only to imagination.
---
Because this is not how us humans work. Everyone only does what is seen as the best and latest. People are already looking at bis lists. If you new shiny sword isn't BiS then people don't want it.
---
Also what were the MMOs you played before WoW? Expansions and level cap increases weren't invented by WoW.
---
Druid single target threat is vastly superior to warrior especially when using the gnome mace.
---
Yup, I got 4 of the iron fishing pole, it gives +20 fishing IIRC, requires level 100 fishing. I had to wait a week or so having them rot in my stash but they are selling for almost 2g now on my server. Kept one just in case though.
---
Had a ZF group looking to do Gahz and our tank/healer from the same guild quit as we were clearing the area you summon him in because “we took too long.” It was like 40m tops into our run.
---
I think the shit that actually needs to be addressed is the fact that all 3 dps in the group somehow managed to all be attacking a separate mob, then when their mob gets to about 10% theyll switch off and start attacking something else.  Please everyone focus fire down the same mob so I'm not taking unnecessary damage, and please finish them off, and please fuck off, I cannot effectively tank 3 separate mobs that are all being dps'd separately and dragged away from me at the same time I'm trying to peel for the healer.
---
Bro I feel your pain, druid tanking is balls, but it's worse when your dps are stuck in retail and have literally never played a tank class and dont understand how shit works.
---
We can't help it. We like how it smells.
---
When you start to get under 60% I would recommend hamstring kiting, will save your life sometimes lol. Also getting some spirit on your pieces helps with health regen, warriors benefit the most with health regen from spirit out of all classes. I went fury until 40 but it will get easier when you get mortal strike and overpower too. If you have a mob below 40% health, kill it with auto attacks to pool rage for the next mob. If you pool enough rage, you can bloodlust to stay in combat, bandage and kill 2 mobs at once with sweeping strikes. 
---
Hang in there it will be worth it!
---
Seems unnecessary but hey, I guess if it works for you.
---
Ironic that you would comment on punctuation while having a punctuation error of your own...
---
A general macro section would be nice, certain scripts/ command structures apply for all classes just have to change the spell after /cast. Otherwise i love the site! nice work!
---
Oh man, I didn't even touch on drop rates. Some of them are crazy. I can put aside disbelief that not all boars have livers or whatever because it would be way too fast if there was a 100% drop rate. But some of these quests take like a half hour to finish ONLY because the drop rate is so crazy low.
---
Guess we'll see once AQ tier rolls around.
---
Id love to see a snapshot comparison of the power creep on talents during vanilla.
---
Fun fact. The term soccer originated from the UK
---
How is this possible??? Are you using data from your phone??
---
I just store them in the mailbox and take out what I need.
---
What do you mean keep in mind we will be getting new talents? Have not heard anything about this.
---
Literally making up mystery where there is non lol. They clearly say they don’t give a shit 😂
---
You're explaining what Greed is for. Greed is for money. Need is for equipping.
---
Wonder how it's come to this.  Kids thinking that it is "hip" to be offensive or as they like to call it "edgy".
---
Every time I reply on Reddit I'm waiting for them to rush in to take a shot at me lol.  XD
---
Still, it seems like a waste of someone's time when theres already an automated report system in place. Just report the person and ignore them. Hopefully they get a punishment, but either way you dont have to see them anymore.
---
WHY would you level as resto? Also are you wearing int/spirit/cloth gear and expecting to do damage/take reasonable amounts of damage. 
---
IMO respect to feral immediately. Even if you don’t, make sure that you have a set of items with armor and agi/strength, and a weapon that gives agi, str, or attack power.
---
I specifically said, IN DUNGEONS.
---
Everything you’ve stated and sourced from blizzard blue posts has not corroborated your assumptions. They say ABC and you turn it into the whole god damn alphabet filling in as you see it fit your narrative. 
---
I am simply trying to make you understand that your understanding of how layering and server populations are related is wrong. You’re grabbing what blizzard has stated and made wild assumptions off it.
---
Thanks for the input.  I have realized that if I want to raid once I reach 60, most likely my guild will expect me to respec to holy.  But I am more talking about the leveling process itself.  I'm only level 37 and have a long way to go.  I'm currently using a Retribution spec with a 2hander but would like to switch to a protection spec to better tank dungeons as I progress.  I am wondering if the already super long leveling time of a paladin is going to be increased further by doing this.  The alternative being I just stick with Ret until 60.
---
Ah yes and you're a master(de)baiter yes? 
---
My post was the counterpoint lmao
---
https://youtu.be/cW_Lv0r-l4c
---
I’m thinking this is the one you’re looking for
---
Thank you for the explanation. I've never played a melee class but I figured this was similar to spell hit percentage increases in some way
---
Flat power creep disincentivizes play though. If the Naxx gear is marginally the same as the post Naxx gear players primary incentive is to beat it once and be done, assuming players even would want that. 
---
Better gear is the carrot on a stick that drives the game, fundamentally.
---
If the gear is only slightly marginally better, you kinda run into the issue retail has where people feel like they're raiding for improvements that don't actually make them feel more powerful.
---
If you try to go on another axis and make gear for underrepresented specs like Enh, Shadow, or Balance, you risk alienating players who don't care for that and giving them little reason to raid.
---
The idea of "Classic+" gear is a tightrope that I would never want to walk. The devs would only have a single shot to get it right, and I dunno if there's a good option.
---
Growl can be very useful, but it depends on the situation. If we've got 3 or 4 in a pull and your pet can tank one just fine, have at it! Pet out of combat rapid health regen makes that efficient as hell if it gets low health before the mob dies AND mend pet doesn't impact the healer's mana pool. Bosses are another story (at least for tanks that use rage) because getting hit is a major source of rage generation. Toggle growl off an on as needed.
---
I’m with this guy. It’s called greed and need for a reason
---
One person took issue to me needed and 2-3 people also rolled need. We decided to just reroll it. I ended up winning the pattern and traded it to the winner of the reroll.
---
In Naxx, where half the raid wasn't fire elementals who were immune to 75% of their spells, yeah they out dps frost.
---
the /sit thing doesnt work no
---
shamans cant cure disease?
---
I’ve always been the tortoise in the group, rarely reaching max level for that expansion. I got easily sidetracked in random quests, tradeskills, and world PvP.
---
But I think that’s the beauty of it all. I had great memories of the game all the same. It also helps break up the monotony of just questing or grinding certain mobs all day.
---
Just have fun. A lot of it comes down to memorable nights rather than comparing yourself to higher tier players.
---
What always motivates me is that I feel like I’m doing much better this time around. Spending a day or two in Wetlands instead of what felt like weeks before.
---
Do rogues have evasion? Or was it one of those 10 minute cool downs?
---
10/10 would raid
---
People always mention flying to avoid PvP but my experience was the opposite. I hadn't made it to outlands before the masses were 70. I couldn't get anything done because geared alliance would swoop in, kill me then camp me from the sky before I had a flying mount.  I had to lvl 100% in dungeons till I had flying.
---
Quest for Thrash Blade is 45. I did my first Mara runs at 44 and couldn’t get it, but dinged in the dungeon and could have it shared before we killed her.
---
Brilliant!
---
No u are wrong
---
&gt; Leave the tanks set the speed. We know what are we doing.
---
Not all of you.  A lot of tanks are used to retail where mana doesn't mean anything anymore and think they can immediately charge into the next pack without ensuring the healers and caster DPS have mana.
---
Oh man, you are a LEGEND!
---
Thanks so much!
---
I don't know about Arcanite Reaper, but I personally re-rolled from one of the low pop servers to a high pop one.  It sucks sitting in line, but it sucks even more being the only person in an entire zone.  
---
Walking into Stormwind and being the only person in the city was the final straw for me.
---
Are you mad? You can run the instance 4 times in 4x the speed
---
People also said that it would ruin the community if a huge amount of new people came into a server (I don’t agree with this, but still, it’s a concern.) Moreover, how would we deal with matching names?
---
Nah, SM is pretty easy to pull the whole room in an aoe group. As long as there aren't 4-5 myrmadons or casters you should be fine if you have decent gear.
---

---
To me, fucking someone over that worked equally as hard as you to get it, and rightfully won it, is not entertainment.
---
It's weird to me that it IS entertainment for some people. Why would I want to watch people get fucked over? I'd rather watch people be kind and courteous to each other.
---
Makes zero sense to me.
---
Everyone is loving Asmongold for being a piece of shit and ninjaing gear from people, but no one gives a fuck about the guy that just got screwed over.
---
Totally fucked thinking.
---
That's twice now you've completely ignored my points instead of attempting to engage them.   Either you literally can't understand them or you understand them and can't argue against them so you just keep repeating your same rules.  I don't talk to walls because walls are devoid of logic.  Later wall.

I got told in my mid 30s in SM to "just use shield slam" it was hilarious.

8 days played to reach 48, with 1 day played at 49 then? uhh ok man, im the stupid one here. what screenshot(s) do you need me to take?

Why did they force the name changes? I don’t see anything wrong

There is not "fair value" right now. The economy on every server is absolutely fucked.
---
ITT: Ninja looters outing themselves as ninja looters.
---
If you plan on selling an item, either by way of vendor or AH, you greed on it; simple as that.
---
If an item is so ridiculously expensive on the AH (200G+ imo) you coordinate with the other party members what you're going to do. If everyone is rolling greed and you roll need because you *really* want the money, you're a fucking ninja looter.
---
Its just like a modern MMO mentality. Look at what happens in Old School Runescape. Same meta shit but way more toxic.
---
Why is defense and mp5 weak? Just because they dont scale like other stats?
---
Depending on your level you can do what I did in the private server that I used to play on go mine thorium Sell the stone to vendors same with truesilver bars stack a true silver bars is 2Gold 50 silver to any vendor
---
Simple,if you make AOE damage you tank it or kite it. And setting targets is the best thing you can do as a Tank, just bind a key to an skull macro.
---
That's not true. There is no community as a whole, there is only a majority and minorty. If the majority of the community is doing things one way that can have an effect on what an individual thinks they *should*, but it doesn't remove their options to do other things the majority is not.
---
As a dps warrior... whose wife heals and whose 15 year old son tanks... i say thank you mages!  My wife and son hate asking if we're not in a group with you guys so i will ask cause my wife will spend her money.  Thank you.  And may all your tips be generous.
---
No you didnt you stole this
---
Ya but I guess it boils down to what value you out on stats and a weapon that you will replace within 10 levels or so(or at least by 60 for sure) 
---
Is 100 gold worth 10extra int or stam. Especially for caster items it’s different from melee weapons.
---
The other argument is if everyone rolls need, nobody can ninja it from the group and sell it
---
Yours is exactly the scenario I had in mind in my original comment. The people who just wanted to satisfy an MMORPG itch while it's popular, but don't have interest in the long goals of the game.
---
Of course they're not related.
---
&gt;Retard, when used as a verb is to refer to delay or hold back in terms of progress or development, or to be delayed. As a noun, it is considered a dated, offensive and pejorative term when used to refer to a person who has a mental disability.
---
It's still an offensive, pejorative word, and I find people actually defending its use to be absolutely mind boggling. Its offensive. Just stop? There are plenty of words you can use in its stead.
---
I feel like the live action movie did a really great job of showing how much stronger Orcs physically were than humans.
---
Berserker Fury or whatever it's called will make a warrior immune to fear for it's duration and break any fear affects active when it's used.
---
But it can only be used in berserker stance so you have to switch over before the fear, hit fury, and back to def stance before you take too much extra damage.
---
I definitely have a few macros that are just barely too long to add another command. I'll have to try this!

something ignorant

Fine by me

Thats where the boats teleport to when leave the map. You get teleported to another boat

Makes sense. What else can you do when you have zero argument?
---
only good experiences so far, everyone is polite, everyone is friendly, everyone has a great time.
---
maybe your server choice was poor. or it just reflects the already mentioned us mentality. if a country has 297mass shootings in 2019 the general population seems to be fucked up online and offline

Ghost wolf is 40% but cheetah is 30%. Also don't think lightning shield procs the daze on cheetah. Looks like the frost shock procced it when he let the shaman get too close.
---
\^\^ This.  The majority of players will not be in zones where that could drop so the market will still be slim and the economy will be much more matured. SAVE IT.
---
I have a level 17, two 11s, and a 10, and have never had a bag drop.
---
Also beat me to it :S
---
do you think that person was actually looking for help by writing on that in game asset?
---
If you start to Google "you think you do but you dont" the auto-complete feature will take you the rest of the way.
---
I seriously don't understand this. It's not a race, someone else beating the game has virtually zero impact on your own play through
---
I got one at about my 3rd, but since I’m new I didn’t understand how lucky I was, thought it was a fairly common drop
---
What a fool I was
---
Blocked either you're trolling or beyond hope either way I don't need to see anything more from you.  Bye
---
My vote goes for progress to TBC and then do TBC+
---
Kinda like how OSRS picked a good version to start with. TBC was the shit and I really am hoping we get it.
---
you can be 60 for all i care. you seem desperate to understand why people like mmos. i think an mmo like destiny or just FPS games are more your style.
---
I loved every moment of this.
---
Is baseball called “hit ball”?  No. Is rugby called “tackle ball”?  No.  This argument never makes sense and it never will
---
Exactly, the omission of information does not mean that information is untrue. There are 100s of misworded and poorly written talents, spells, abilities, and item descriptions in the game, and this is one of them. I have tested this talent, I put one point in at a time. The spell exchanges Health for Mana, when you increase 1 side of the scale the other increases respectively.
---
Tbh I planned to do some testing today based on the spell dmg type, because it does not cause normal spell dmg like hellfire or a normal enemy's spell, and wanted to take a look at if generic spell power and shadow spell power have the same effect.
---
Prat 3.0 has a ton of chat options and customization. You should give that a shot. I love it.
---
I think I'll get to 60 and maybe some blues, then start wearing out.  Might be interested in making a horde alt since PVP servers for alliance are trash and almost unbearable in contested zones.
---
Not any more than anyone else.
---
You should be pulling mobs back to a safe distance before you fear them. That way even if they do run and pull more you can easily kite and leash the adds and just kill the one you want to.
---
100%. They catered to casuals to get more people engaged xpack through xpack and just lost it.
---
I mean, we can blame Blizzard for caving to casuals with shit like dumbing down everything from spells to mana management to class identity
---
Talking about toxic edgy kids when you are behaving just like one. Take a good look in the mirror my dude and be ashamed of yourself.
---
Either you are about 14 or actually so old that you've gone demented and thus are acting out.
---
Okay cool, good idea. Thank you! Just wasn't sure and yes I want to start saving for mount because I'm lvl 16 and dont even have 1g yet, got close last night with like 70ish silver but then promptly spent alot listing more auctions

How is the popularity of this holding up after the release?

How do you get to the point of knowing about the boat from Dustwallow without knowing about the boat from Darkshore?
---
This is basically the Classic WoW version of the Charlie Day "Pepe Silvia" bit and I love it.
---
Eve is a little different tho. There's large corporation fighting each other. 
---
The guild in this scenario would be set up to provide safety. That would be their primary function and they would charge a small fee to facilitate the transactions. Of they fail to provide safety, they are useless. People won't use them. So if they want to keep gathering fees, they need to provide safety.
---
I bought green shoulders for cheap because waiting until level 30 for shoulders was bugging the hell out of me.
---
Not true. Never happened in Vanilla. Doubt it will happen in Classic.
---

---
Find a new guild
---
That makes a bit more sense then. Only real issue then is the small but vocal people who would be unhappy with their Naxx gear losing relevance.
---
In a perfect world or at max level, yeah. If I'm in a PUG group and something that will pay for my mount drops, someone is going to roll need. Just easier to have everyone roll need on it. If someone doesn't want to participate they can pass or greed.
---
&gt; There's something about this "meta" that pisses me off, probably since it's such a retail mentality
---
Actually I think it comes more from private servers than retail.
---
To answer the question of how, Sylvanas broke free from Arthas's control due to the Lich King (Ner'zhul) weakening, after nearly killing Arthas she managed to free several other undead, which are mostly human due to the plague originating in the northern parts of the kingdom of Loraeron an entirely human nation. Sylvanas then went about raising the dead in Lordaeron as forsaken to increse her numbers to fight the scourge and later get revenge on Arthas.
---
Rip on many levels
---
Druids will always be the best at getting threat when they aren't getting hit.
---
The excuse to not play isn't all bad. I no lifed the first week to level 30 and I haven't touched the game since. I'm only just beginning to not feel burnt out and i'll spend the weekend getting back into it.
---
Found it, thanks a lot.

Say you're almost done when you start and then leave when you finish.

Hell yeah!! Me too.

What does the "#showtooltip" thing do?
---
For the ice block and CS macros, what is the difference between the macros and just using the spells normally?
---
another episode of the ol razzle dazzle
---
Thanks!!
---
Yes - BS generates threat for every player it buff, on every nearby mob, while Demo generates threat for every mob it debuffs on that mob alone. Before the hotfix, Demo generated threat for every mob it debuffed, on every mob - an exponential increase! This made it very easy for warriors and druids to keep aggro, even over Hellfiring warlocks or Blizzarding mages.
---
Is n’t there a book some where you just read to change over? And you should still be able to use the Gnome stuff.
---
Myndflame hasn’t exactly been active in a while. Last I saw of him, he was called out on the League of Legends Cypher years ago and that’s about it. So I don’t think that guild was legit, personally.

At first I thought general knowledge of WoW had gone up but the past week has proven me wrong.

Hey Mr. lvl 45 alliance. I'm really glad you're killing all the Horde near the Crystal Spine Basilisks. But they've left me alone so far and it doesn't look like you need my help. So, I'm just gonna sit tight and my mind my own business.
---
I was able to get the preraid bis helm for healing priests, cassandra’s grace. Currently selling on my server’s ah for ~90g. My thought is to hold off on selling it until economy develops/more people at get 60. Maybe I will sell it in 2 weeks or a month from now. Thoughts?
---

---
It costs 1 gold to reset your talents the first time and increases every time after. It gets unreasonably expensive very fast so it's not really viable to do while leveling since you're saving for your mount.  
---
Point is, while you're not "locked in", it's still not wise to plan on switching back and forth based on whatever you feel like doing at the time.
---
there's nothing wrong with leaving once you get your kills. people will simply appreciate you helping them with those 4 kills instead of competing with you for mobs. i'll help people sometimes, sometimes I'll move on, there's no wrong scenario there.
---
Questie i think is a good add-on to help you find quest in your level ( also helps you complete them which some are opposed to).
---
I use [wowhead.com](https://wowhead.com) and [icy-veins.com](https://icy-veins.com). Both have guides for beginners and advanced content.

1 person posted a few hours ago about a 3 day ban. the comment wasn't bad either and had 151 upvotes!
---
There is literally zero whining in the OP.
---
You are at level 38 so you don't have that many points in talents yet. At this moment was talents do you have so we can get a better idea to help you.
---
I'm just curious how you would ballance a 30% increase in dps in PvP?
---
Are we discussing things here or do you literally think my argument is absolutely insane?
---
I usually just help them finish. The extra XP, money and vendor trash is usually worth it.
---
Prot pallies are the best 5 man tanks in the game hands down. They were back in vanilla, they are in classic aswell. Paladins just suck late game there is no supporting gear for raiding and pallies run out of mana so fast. Maybe if your raid dps was through the roof the fight would be short enough, when a prot pally is oom, they literally cant do anything lol.
---
Any hate pallys get while lvling, or even in 5 mans at 60, is from complete buffoons who have 0 clue about the game.
---
lol -== that was worth watching
---
I am new to the game and I am level 30 mage. What is the best way to level up for me?
---
Our 1 druid is this spec right now. He tanks on some fights and heals on others. It's nice to have the flex role
---
Hi me!
---
I totally forgot about the PVP half of the game, and now that you mention it I do remember being about 13 and feeling the pressure and excitement of capping a flag while self healing! Definitely enjoying this nostalgic feeling with the rest of the community here!
---
This is indeed a retail thing. Can’t they just play retail and let the rest enjoy grouping and play together.
---
&gt; But come on dude you know the people in this thread are just being vindictive and getting off on playing god.
---
Nope, it's about the group not falling apart and giving up. I played too much Vanilla on my priest to think the healer's job is to keep everyone alive at all times (experienced rogues and mages would frequently tell the party to let them die when they screwed up).
---
When DPS pull aggro, the tank stops building up threat. But if the healer keeps healing, the healer is also building up threat, albeit at a highly accelerated rate. It's not just another few heals added to the list. Low-mitigation classes like mages and rogues take **much more** damage so they will require **much more** healing.
---
There are a lot of scenarios as to how this can play out, but for me the takeaway was that it's best not to heal non-tanking classes while they have aggro. It screws up the balance of tank/healer threat too much.
---
I love it. Do both! A physical location for meeting in cities for pve content to find people for general groups really adds to the community factor, and make the meeting stones down.
---
Define "impossible" in this context. I'm not sure what you mean. They absolutely could have done all horizontal starting with TBC.

That's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about a mage, in a group, getting ready to run a dungeon, wanting to charge everyone for a stack of summoned water.

End game when you roll resto?
---
It's quieter, though.  People who just wanna get some mob kills and questing go there.  If you're seeking PvP, or just don't know better you go to STV.  Hillsbrad is the same way.

Also worth point out going through so many of the patch notes, dungeons 40+ got nerfed in the 1.9-1.12 series of patches. ZF, BRS, SCHOLO and STRAT all got nerfed, had mobs removed, weakened, respawn times lowered, or turned from elites to regular mobs. 
---
For Example the ZF nerfs in 1.12
---
* The respawn of the 2 Troll/1 Basilisk patrollers should now be 2 hours.
---
* Reduced the damage dealt by the Sul'lithuz Abomination and Sul'lithuz Sandcrawler.
---
* Zul'Farrak Dead Heroes are no longer elites.
---
* [Theka the Martyr](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Theka_the_Martyr) will now only remain immune to physical damage for 30 seconds before reverting to normal.
---
* Antu'sul's Sul'lithuz Broodlings now only hatch 4 at a time and are significantly weaker.
---
* [Witch Doctor Zum'rah](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Witch_Doctor_Zum%27rah) will no longer call as many Zul'Farrak Zombies to his aid when aggroed.
---
* [Weegli Blastfuse](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weegli_Blastfuse) now has slightly more hit points.
---
* Antu'sul's Warden no longer attempts to knock adventurers into [Antu'sul](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Antu%27sul)'s lair.
---
* Sandfury Cretins who engage the party during the pyramid event are no longer able to cast shadow bolt.

I'm playing a druid for the first time seriously and I've read all the posts about them being sub par. Bla blah blah, who cares. I'm having fun. Gonna tank Deadmines this weekend with friends. Just have fun your way, find people who have fun a similar way, and profit with good times.
---
OK, but what if all I have is a question to ask? What am I supposed to add to the post to make it worthy of not being deleted?
---
Canadians thought they won because they got to continue being Canada.
---
Americans thought they won because they got to continue being America and some maritime practices changed to (I guess) favor Americans.
---
The British didn't give a shit about anything.
---
Like everything in history, what actually transpired depends on who you ask and it's most likely surrounded in myth and cultural bias anyway so, like the British, I don't give a shit either.
---

The book is seemingly not added until *The Burning Crusade* expansion. I've checked, and am not able to find it :(
---
If they played every other game anything like they did in the video, I’d say they’re pretty clever.
---
Oh God as an alliance there’s nothing I hate more than Grom’Gol.
---
Horde already get easy access to Ratchet (and thus Booty Bay by extension), but then they get fucking zeppelins to Grom’Gol too? And Alliance literally have to run the length of the zone from Darkshire, which is the nearest flight path , just to get to another flight path in Booty Bay.
---
And the whole way there you’re gettin picked off by groups of Horde cause you gotta basically run right by Grom’Gol on the way. They really wanted to make that a Horde zone for sure when they created it.
---
I appreciate you actually trying to have a discussion and adding in personal anecdotes versus telling me I’m an idiot and I don’t know what I’m talking about like most Blizzdrones on this sub 
---
Leeway also feels terrible when kiting a warrior/rogue especially as a ranged class, being auto attacked from 10+ yards away feels awful, but dying to abilities from Mages after they die feels god awful as well.
---
Idk what can be done but it feels terrible.
---
What change did they implement?

---
Am I the only person who loves PVP but doesn’t like arena? It’s such a dull, lifeless form of PVP.
---
Damn that’s harsh.. What did the comment say? (If you remember)
---
Haha ok, whatever dude. Just don’t fall too hard from that high horse of yours.
---
You're walking a dangerous line by pointing that out...
---
It's not uncommon for hunters to use their pets to pull bosses to where you want to fight them. 
---
The reason to do it in vanilla was the hunter could easily guide one mob into an ice trap, and like you said, feign if it got bad.
---
These days, nobody really cares about threat and just want to get through as fast as possible...there's a large glut of mages on every server for this reason. Vaelastrasz is gonna eat these retail kids alive.
---
Also once you've leveled one class, you've pretty much seen it all at that point. Leveling alts is a massive pain in the ass in classic because of how time consuming it if you don't spam dungeons or pick an AoE class.
---
Finish your quest and leave.
---
Wow that's a very honorable move.... for a Horde scum.
---
of course. too big of a ship and you can't hit the smaller ones. 
---
but i remember playing and needing to get into a battleship because it was the best ship. of course this was before all of the redesigns and the BS was the biggest ship in the game.
---
Miss*
---
If the battle shout fix is up and they pull with a no damage spell you can easily get it back once everyone is in combat.
---
Even just rabies in Duskwood as a rogue sucked
---
The problem is LFG is so overly saturated with the spellcleave spam bullshit that it ruins the entire channel for the other 5 classes in the game. 
---
It's not only exclusionary but it's taking all the healers for normal dungeon groups making it harder for the rest of us to find anything.
---
Awesome, thanks for the tips!
---
Literally doesn't matter. Feral druids are fantastic tanks in classic. Bosses dont hit hard enough for them be bad
---
Nothing to do with the conversation
---
For Stormwind!  For the Alliance!
---
Well as a Paladin, I would just bubble hearth in these situations.
---
I can fully agree with the buyout sorting thing. The bag spaces left, sure, it doesn't break the feel of it being an RPG since I'm sure the character can count (see bag spaces) and remember the number (being shown on the main backpack perhaps) of empty spaces left.
---
The more pets though, not sure how much it would move towards feeling like an arcade game rather than an rpg. Can't agree there.
---
"And so it came to pass[...]"
---
Insanity.  I don't have the crayons to explain to you the myriad of ways modern games have handled pve/pve balance and how more viability would be good for the game.
---
the only potential problem i have with it is giving the x,y coordinates but honestly, doesnt bother me that much.
---
.... Good god. There's elephants on them.
---
... on day 6.
---
This can not be over-stated lol.
---
The amount of green gear, the lack of fire resist, the glancing blows, the lack of hit on all DPS, the mana pools of the healers, the avoidance of the tanks... They couldn't have been more than 10% of a "full-powered" MC raid, and they still downed Rag.
---
The game isn't hard anymore, folks. We've all got high-def audio + voip, youtube tutorials, twitch streams, high speed internet, fast gaming PCs, knowledge of keybinds, macros, addons, etc.
---
Maybe 5% of WoW gamers had even just some of thats tuff in 2004.
---
We are playing a different game, now. And that's OK.
---
This is why on those 200g+ items you should coordinate to roll need so one person doesn't pull this.
---
Yea true, still going to try though for the challenge
---
"Trash Blade" is pre raid bis? I used it for a long ass time but replaced it with Krol Blade at some point, which is a world drop but still.
---
yah fuck that dude. send me the nudes instead.
---
As alliance I just ask myself "What  member of the fellowship uses this weapon? Axe? Off to ironforge."
---
Yup.  This happened in vanilla.
---
a few for consideration off the top of my head.. I haven't thought them all the way through:
---
* northern STV flight point
---
* dungeon maps
---
* event calendar
---
* more events
---
* achievements
---
* titles
---
* archaeology
---
* pet battles
---
* dark moon faire
---
DON'T RUN IN ELEVATORS!
---
Just because you turned it into a meme doesn't make this an argument.  
---
If you're going to use the item, whether it be a gear upgrade or a recipe, you roll need.  
---
If you're going to sell the item, you roll greed.  
---
If you don't even want it taking up space in your inventory or you just want a friend to have a better shot at the roll, you pass.  
---
This isn't up for debate.
---
Especially in twill!
---
As canon as my shit.
---
Most classes hit their stride in the mid 20's, some (like Warriors) don't get particularly fun until 40's + getting gear. Hunter was the first class I leveled and stuck through 2 expansions with. While it does have party/raid utility I found it to be more of a solo class. There's a lot of niche utility you bring, and you have a tool for almost every situation. This was fun for what I wanted to do, but it has its drawbacks. Not to mention I always wish I'd picked a hybrid class first as well. 
---
I'd say unless you hate it, stick with hunter until the mid 20's. If you just can't get into it reroll. If you aren't having fun and want to have more options to try healing or tanking, I'd just reroll something else immediately.
---
Stack damage not int
---
I've seen sooooo many people claim damage is bad for leveling and I don't understand it. I'm was rocking about 120 frost damage by the time I hit 46 and it was jaw droppingly effective. My bolts hit 30% harder than the tooltip would indicate. That is insane.
---
 Idk why people think replacing all that damage with ?a larger... Mana... Pool?????? The hell?!
---
If you kill mobs faster, you level faster and cast fewer spells. It's a win-win-win situation.
---
Use your words: if your out of mana, make it known in chat don't just start drinking. In fact, make a macro along the lines of "/p I am OUT OF MANA! Do NOT pull or you will die and I will laugh."
---
Multi role: You are never only a heal but. Between heals / everyone at full health? Start sanding the baddies. Does not only apply to wand using heals - shamans and Paladino's throw in some melee, druids can moon fire.
---
Priorities: Did the rogue pull aggro AGAIN? Stop healing him, he'll learn. If you go out of mana because DPS can't manage threat we're all doomed. The tank has the highest repair bill he needs it more.
---
Off the top of my head.
---
That’s why they give us the ability to make our own water
---
I honestly feel like there should be a classicwowmemes subreddit to complement this subreddit and then we could all have whatever experience we choose.  I have to agree that the quality of posts here has absolutely tanked since launch though.
---
You do not stay around to help on quests with your group if it's just some random nonelite easy quest. The only reason you are in group is to share the mobs so you don't have to wait for respawns. 
---
If it was some sort of elite quest or highlvl quest however where the other guy can't solo the mobs or would have a very hard time to, then it's good manners to stay around to make sure he can complete it :)
---
You realize this isn't a change. The spell batching was EVEN WORSE in vanilla. Go back to retail.
---
&gt;this post brought to you by the priest, shaman, paladin, druid, and hunter gang
---
Awesome, I had it backwards. Couldn't remember that guys name either.
---
I've never known the answer to this, even playing in vanilla... but how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
---
well I can’t help it if your an idiot and bad at the game.  also mana classes are for the weak.  also try pulling that shit leveling technique you are so proud of on a pvp server, you’ll realize how bad you are real quick.  fckn retail dumbass
---
I can’t imagine what raid boss fights will be like since they last a while, sounds like it’ll be tough to balance mana and dps
---
What's the battle shout fix?
---
Shamaritan*
---
I’ll see myself out now
---
uhh master loot you just have to be in the instance.
---
&gt; but the person who would sell it for mount money is completely broke?
---
Irrelevant. If you spent all your gold, you don't get to take something from me because you're greedy.
---
Thanks for the notes, would’ve never searched for them otherwise.
---
I just want mage food for my pets!!!!haha
---
Yes, but Blizzard is never going to add faction queues and refuse people to play the game when they are paying a monthly fee. Faction transfer is an interesting option (altough the \#nochanges people will probably lose their shit).
---
The best thing would have been if Blizzard had put up a faction lock from launch and onwards when people were creating their characters, so that whenever you first created a character on any server it would lock it to either alliance or horde with a 45/55 ratio and after that you could make as many character as you wanted for that faction.
---
I know that if my server becomes something like 70/30 or worse I just cba to play there, its not fun at all and you are barely able to play the game as you are always vulnerable and outnumbered in every scenario, and when the slope is quite steep since more people like me and cba to play under those circumstances.
---
I just hope Blizzard will acknowledge it and tries to do something about it, like even promoting it on their facebook saying that X server needs more alliance players or whatever so that they are at least doing something to make people emigrate. If they stay silent and do nothing I will assume that a lot of servers might end up as faction servers which is not ideal, especally when they are marked as PvP.
---
I mean sometimes he'll see loot and I wont but the chat will say "Your share of loot is 10 copper", so does that mean it was 20 copper and we both got 10?
---
Yikes?
---
They were always there you just never noticed.
---
I actually think he thought "exp run" means they want "experienced players" to go on the run with them. After thinking about wtf this guy could have been on about some more
---
There is plenty of time to say “ hey that’s a good upgrade mind if I need it” 99% of ppl are gonna say  ya np Gratz .
---
So you bubbled him?
---
Thank you, that was great content.
---
The biggest problem facing druids is what one person kinda glossed over, only a single druid's hots can be on a person at a time. As a result, you bring them for the incredible raid cooldowns they have, not their healing potential, because more than 1 has dramatically reduced healing potential.
---
Innervate, Rebirth, and Tranquility are all literally irreplaceable in classic.
---
I mean this has been the case on private servers for a while now, and I don't expect Classic to be significantly different as far as the numbers go. MCP are also literally the easiest of the consumes to get. All the pots/juju needed take considerably more time to farm up, but every other class has to do the same thing. I think if you weren't really wanting to put out that kind of effort and just wanted to raid casually then you would be right. Be a fury war and do decent damage even without full consumes.
---
Holy shit I didn't know wowhead on mobile had the most intrusive ads I have EVER seen on a website. Jesus.
---
Wait what do you mean stack damage?
---
Imagine not being interested in being a human in a crazy fucking universe like WoW. Shit is nuts
---
Private servers worked will with no content for years because they were constantly getting shut down or were classic progression servers. If they do literally nothing with the game after the phases end then most of the servers are going to be ghost towns after a few months.
---
You both need to grow the fuck up IMO.
---
How is that a problem...
---
Classic isn't good because you have to afk in a city for 40mins looking for a group. It's good because the dungeon takes time, encourages talking to one another and feels like it's part of the world.
---
JuSt FoRm YoUr OwN GrOuPs.

In all seriousness obviously ppl are going to follow the meta, it's 2019.

American Concussionball!

Every quest is about grinding mobs. Some make you grind more than others.
---
Quest EXP is a small percentage of your overall.
---
Delta has fast internet speeds available on some flights. I managed to play on United this past week. 1.7k ms but as a hunter in an easy place it wasn’t to bad to get some grinding done.
---
Who could imagine in 2004 that I would be playing the same goddamn game on a MacBook Pro on a flight 15 years later
---
You still haven't said what it is.
---
During prime time, around 6:30 pm, it’s still about a 6k queue.
---
If you say so. Personally, I would think that if progression servers are more popular than a "golden age" unchanging EQ server, that's not a great argument in favor of a "golden age" unchanging WoW server.
---
Bubble cancels the chest opening?
---
lul, I'm a healer and all these posts do is reiterate that a lot of the players making these posts are just straight up bad at the game.
---
Not so much of a big deal for Druid and Paladin tanks but topping off the first bit of damage we take at the start of a pull usually makes making aoe threat a precedent before we can get big threat on the first target.
---
Not game ending but definitely inconvenient sometimes.
---
i'm not. just get annoyed at people consciously deciding to play unoptimal specs for raiding like boomkins enhance shamans etc and then complaining that they can't keep up with pure dps specs and that the game has to be balanced to accomodate them.
---
"Probably a 40 year old who did nothing with his life" 
---
Said the 40 year old doing nothing with his life.
---
Yeah it will take me to this sub and show me basically the same comment I replied to posted dozens of different ways.
---
You, I like you.
---
&gt; I feel like I'm the only tank in the world who busts my ass to keep the entire group alive no matter what. That's literally why I'm playing a tank.
---
I'm running into a ton of players who seem to just not want to play dynamically or their class at all.  It doesn't make sense to me. In uncoordinated 5 mans with a game that is still pretty buggy at times, mistakes are going to happen.  Mages not conjuring stuff, healers not healing warlocks that tap, tanks not picking up mobs to prove a point. Play your fucking class people. If you have an issue with how someone is playing, use your keyboard to let them know how they could improve your experience.
---
I play up my ability to summon slackers as a purple mage.
---
When I'm tanking I'm perfectly fine if the healer pulls, but only the healer.
---
Haha, blomodlaren.
---
shaman for 5 man stuff if for no other reason than that they have a no CD rez and a self rez. Both of which can make deaths in dungeons so much more bearable.
---
I’ll def check out different gear then ty for the tip. Any good source for +damage gear? I’m a tailor but have been slacking on it a bit
---
Probably because a lot of people are already at the end game after two weeks. Just because you are taking your time to get to 60 doesn't mean other people want to.
---
For leveling, weapon dps, stamina and agility.
---
For level 60 - weapon dps, hit, crit and agility.
---
When you're done you say im done thank you cya
---
Yeah that's one thing I never do on tanks. I've noticed im now level 31 and I haven't had to use a single shield on anyone in the dungeon runs. Maybe I'm lucky
---
In cata, my friend and I joined a group that was creating characters with jersey shore names. My friend was Snooki and I was a rouge named The Robbery. It was stupid but it was fun
---
I'm honestly thinking about stopping. Had a shitload of fun from 1-30 but everything since then has been a fucking slog to get through. A maximum of 2 quests per zone I can do, the rest are orange/red so I have to fly across the damn world to a different zone, where I also have two quests I can do and the rest are too high level. Coupled with overfarmed spots this ends in me not even getting any fucking leveling in because after flying around for 10 minutes, I can't even get the mobs I need.
---
I barely have fun at all. I can't even remember the last time I logged in and had fun, it's all just a chore because I spend at least an hour of my playtime per day on travelling just to not get any fucking XP.
---
Druid was always the least played class in vanilla. I remember when I began looking for raiding guilds back then and every single B-tier and most A-tier guilds had open spots on their raid team for druids. Being a druid while leveling meant I could slot in as dps, healer, or tank for any 5man. It also means that you can support heal/tank in some fights as well. 
---
Enjoy the class; you'll be fine at 60.
---
I assume he tried to stay out of combat and take the chest, so OP used power word barrier to draw him into combat and cancel the opening of the chest.
---
Or when you are trying to remember which elevator as you enter UC:

---
It's funny how people make these posts not understanding that they're being that exact same person
---
Lol , pathetic of the mod that issued the ban..
---
You can see nameplates through walls...
---
I'm aware of that, but the way this sub jerks themselves off about it you would think there were people all over the sub posting about how the game is going to die off.
---
Exactly, they should just remove the greed button, leave two options - need or pass.
---
But wait, why wouldn't people then simply roll need on everything? After all, if it can be sold for gold then somebody will need it! Get rid of rolling all together! Loot will be decided entirely by the game.
---
Oh wait, we have that. In retail.
---
And if the Tank is rooted or something similar and you as dps or healer have aggro, you walk the mob towards the Tank and not in the complete opposite direction...
---
Wowhead says squirrel.....not seeing it TBH.
---
So you want classic to die? You know, let's just agree to disagree here because at this point I think we have fundamentally different viewpoints.
---
ok. agree to disagree, i am on a pvp server and i still avoid pvp if my goal is to level. this is a question of context where it’s not provided.
---
Undead best horde starting zone. Change my mind.
---
I agree with the list. I had more fun leveling characters than end game content. I had a level 70 of every class before I got bored with the game altogether.
---
Yeah yeah I know.
---
That's Insane.
---
Thank you for sharing your loot with us.
---
You mean his boyfriend.
---
Alliance players never go to these lengths to do this...
---
same, glad I decided to switch it up. And luckily, I picked the underdog, ahhaha.
---
Lmfao
---
How can you leave thr L lower case and capitalize it at the same time?
---
Cold call random people in your are using the social tab, really helps with questing. If the people are helpful, add them to your friends list
---
Yeah I always avoid using shield unless I get aggro. Even then I used my Fade ability and just fixes it
---
This whole thread following your message is the reason I hate raiding.
---
So many raiders view it as some kind of damage meter competition, when in fact you don't *need* every DPS in the raid doing optimal damage to complete a raid. You need a good core of skilled players who have fun being skilled and optimizing their shit, and the rest of the raid can be free to play what they want, how they want. As long as they're not just faffing about, if they're contributing damage, it's good enough. The difference between a raid full of hardcore BIS-masters and a raid with half the players just having fun is maybe a few minutes per boss. If the healers and tanks and core DPS know what they're doing, and the rest of the raid is not being pants-on-head stupid, the raid is not going to wipe.
---
Now, in retail, with so many levels of difficulty of raids, pulling off the hardest ones absolutely requires everyone to know what they're doing and be optimally spec'd for their role. One of the things I love about classic is that shit was not in the game yet. Raids are big enough that you can even carry a few sightseers. I think that's cool.
---
That Orc shoulda spun back and helped.  That was his fight.
---
Adding on, you can earn reputation by doing that faction’s quests. I believe you can also donate items like cloth to certain NPCs in that race’s capital in order to gain rep.
---
PvP.
---
Everyone in the party deserves the gold. You don't deserve it just for being a mage; just like I don't deserve it for myself if Edgemasters drops. Whether you choose to equip it or not does not matter. Opportunity cost is still very much a cost, and it is your choice to **spend** the gold by equipping it.
---
We are In the same guild :) I go by Minroth
---
Had a guy who remebered my name from wotlk, added on bnet and we talk some today.
---
&gt; ASCII was not allowed in names during vanilla.
---
You don't seem to know what ASCII is. This is also not what your source says.
---
Good enough for me thanks!
---
Naicu
---
It is called opportunity cost, you could have sold it and obtained the same value as anyone else in the group. Instead you effectively bought the item by not selling it, thus paying for the item.
---
That clutch heal man and omg that swing.
---
It depends how angry you get I think haha. I joined the same realm as other friends, they chose PvP. Stranglethorn Vale has almost made me throw my computer at my friend...
---
How is that exploiting?
---
Omg it's 2008 again
---
&gt; are we at the point where we make up fictive scenarios so we can shit at retail players?
---
This sub has been well beyond that point for years. It's a cult in denial.
---
&gt; high AC
---
What's high AC?
---
&gt;but my friends and I are lvl 20 to 30.
---
Then don't read these threads? I'm not sure what's the problem exactly.
---
Majority of players are probably still in that 20/30 range.  Streamers/folks who rushed to 60/etc. are very much in a small % and they're primarily the ones going "wHaT's NeXt ThErE's NoThInG tO dO"
---
You forget the drive by rapings, if your on a pvp server. Those are great too 😊
---
Funny comic! But no
---
I was clearing mobs next to a chest, this guy runs up and tries to take it out from under me without saying anything or asking to roll for it, so I just bubbled myself and the mobs attacked him instead of me, stopping him from opening the chest.
---
Face makes it even better
---
Ah so you play on a Horde dominated dead server, gotcha pal.
---
Also I never claimed to be dying to mobs, you should work on your reading comprehension and spend less time arguing with people on the flatearth subreddit.
---
Yea that's just flat out wrong. Nice contribution tho
---
Nah I waited a week to let the servers relax and I joined thunderfurry since it was a new one. We're full now which is nice to see. Q time is like 8 minutes tops most nights. Half the time just at high pop
---
Haha yeah for sure will be a good opportunity especially how cheap houses will be. Idk I’m not in a position to give advice. It’s just interesting because I look at loan documents all day everyday and it’s something I noticed as a trend while doing my regular job.
---
Oh ok, good to know thx.
---
Ninja looters in here all salty at OP. 😏
---
This is Reddit, do you actually expect good/competent moderation?
---
&gt; If you want it, go buy on the AH for X amount of gold. It is worth the same to everyone.
---
Doesn't matter how much gold you get for it, my use of it is worth more.
---
Not true. Early greens are soooo cheap that its easily affordable while leveling. Got a great lvl 8 mace for 5s. Thats nothing yet my dps literally doubled and the next quest reward to get close is like at 13 or so. Why roll with grey bracers until level 16 when +agi +stam lvl 12 bracers are 6s? Easy upgrade. 
---
Just dont do it often or after level 20 since thats when gear starts costing like 30s+
---
Honestly I like just telling the healer to also heal the pet. They are tanky as shit and it's one less mob for me to deal with.
---
LOL reported
---
Promotes toxicity
---
Not enough guns to be worthy of that title, and it's restricted to hunters.
---
I'm torn between leveling a Druid or Shaman. I've rolled a few Druids to 60 in the past (one in OG Classic, the others on pservers), but I've only tanked. My main goal is to heal end-game, hopefully in MC/BWL+, and maybe some PvP.
---
Can anyone provide a pros/cons list for each class - Druid and Shaman? I'm most interested in what life is like at 60, not how quickly/difficult it is to level.
---
PvE.  It's what I played in 2004/5/6.  #NOCHANGES
---
Might need to pick up gatherer 2. I think I saw that on the twitch app
---
this is a cropped photo.
---
&gt;The more pets though, not sure how much it would move towards feeling like an arcade game rather than an rpg. Can't agree there.
---
Not active pets. Stable slots. I'm not suggesting I should be able to carry five different pets at once and switch them out at will like you can in retail. Having the opportunity to go into the world to find new pets for my collection and then having to level them up (including loyalty) feels really RPG-like to me. 
---
&gt;The gear you're wearing is what's supposed to be seen.
---
Then people just have to carry an RP set in their bags and use a macro to switch while in town. The big thing - and this is apparent on pservers - is that there aren't enough gold sinks in the game right now and inflation is going to become a big problem in later phases. Players today are more informed and there's going to be a lot more gold in circulation than there was back in Vanilla.
---
NO FUCKING COSPLAY IN CLASSIC WOW. FUCK OFF TO YOUR FUCKIGN ANIME
---
TAHK YOU
---
I haven't ran into any old gaming buddies yet but I got invited to a random guild yesterday and we got to talking about where everyone is from and apparently I graduated with 2 of the members and we haven't seen each other in almost 15 years. Small world
---
Dance in crossroads and you'll have mount in no time
---
If it’s a lvl 60 BoE epic that you’re going to equip, I disagree. If it’s a high tier professions schematic/pattern that you’re going to use, I disagree. 
---
Everything else though, I agree. Fuck equipping lvl 40 BoE epics or blues, some of that shit will literally buy our entire party their mount and you’ll just end up vendoring it soon enough. Don’t get me started on people leveling trying to equip top-tier twink gear
---
Can't answer the level one directly but you'd probably need at least 5 points in the talent to make your drain 70% uninteruptable. So that's gonna be lvl 19 at the earliest and you may still find you don't have the stamina to do it efficiently until you gear up more.  
---
For the other question, a couple of things. First, try to pull far enough away or to a safe spot that they would need to travel far to aggro more. Secondly, curse of recklessness makes the target immune to fears. So if you have a guy feared, you can put curse of recklessness on and it'll override the fear and they'll start coming back to you. If you overwrite that recklessness with curse of agony, the fear will take effect again. It takes a bit of practice and some good keybindings, but you can effectively "juggle" a feared mob that way
---
Murlocs - The one where Joey mmmrmrrrgggrrrbbblllggrrrbbbllll
---
The best leveling spec for rogue is combat swords, you might want to respec and get some swords as it will be alot faster. Send me a PM if you want more information.
---
Says the guy that stalked my comment history looking for fuel to reddit battle me with.  
---
loooser lmao
---
No, the dude that ninja'd the chest initiated the confrontation by TRYING TO NINJA. The dude that speaks first isn't automatically the one at fault. He called the dude out on his behavior, which needs to be done more often in reality.
---
The option is literally "Greed"... you may need to google that one if you are confused.
---
That was a fucking disgrace. The only place I ever got to do DPS as a druid was against Ebonroc or some other BWL drake which required little healing, and then got shamed by our asshole main tank for not doing more DPS even though I had never been allowed to roll on any agility gear, and the guild refused to do the emerald drake for the feral hammer. It was a goddamn disgrace, it was. Later we got to tank Garr when BWL was already on farm.
---
dude gonna get bindings first drop
---
The thing about rogues is that at a baseline, you have enough to make you a decent threat to half the classes. You don't need to spec anything to vanish, gouge, kidney shot, blind, vanish, cheap shot, sap, etc. You're already a 1v1 powerhouse, and can easily fuck people up even as a combat swords build.
---
This is the classic way.  Works especially well if you have a warlock and say "We can summon you."
---
Healing really comes down to Mana management. What I've found works well is to renew before the pull then wait for tank to get to 40-50% hp then hit them with my biggest heal and a renew right after. This tops them off and sustains them while I regen Mana. 
---
Avoid overhealing.
---
Someone doesn't know what exploiting is...
---
This is what I'm going to run with while leveling, doing 5 man dungeons, UBRS, and MC. 0/30/21 Heart of the Wild Spec.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505202130310215-05500302501
---
Once BWL hits though I'll probably go with something more like this. 24/0/27 Moonglow spec.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/51330033020013--505003115115
---
The important bit of going so deep into the balance tree is to pick up that sweet sweet reduced casting time and 9% reduced mana cost.
---
Then in AQ40/Naxx I'll probably do something along the lines of 21/0/30:
---
Because once you're in that late game, you don't need those three points in making yourself more mana efficient, your gear is taking care of that, you need the increased utility of downranked regrowths, that provide another HOT. Even though they are expensive to cast, your T2 or equivalent gear will give you the mana pool to power through it.
---
You may ask, "why are you avoiding swiftmend?" And it's because swiftmend is essentially a panic button, and you already have one of those, it's called nature's swiftness. The reduced cast times, especially on a downranked HT (rank 3 or 4) is going to vastly outweigh the utility of swiftmend, swiftmend is a huge mana drain, you or someone else has already cast a regrowth or rejuvenate for it's full mana cost, and then you're gonna use 20% of your base mana to cut off its ticks to apply the spell again all at once. What does that sound like? A healing touch, but with a instant cast time. The only time it approaches overall mana efficiency is in the last 3 seconds of the HOT.
---
Wow! Does your wife let you lick Tyrone’s cum out of her pussy for being such a good samaritan?
---
Definitely. Tried out fraps when I had a 590 and it would slog my fps. I haven't noticed any kind of slowdown from shadowplay, and it's extremely smooth video.
---
Hahah
---
They've taken to calling us all boomers. BITCH we started the age war on Boomers.
---
Yeah I normally wand them down or use mind blast to get the killing blow on them since its important for priests to get the killing blow (if they've taken the spirit tap talent). Getting a killing blow actives spirit tap which increases spirit by 100% for 15 secs
---
Deep in ass ...
---
Do you have a guild or group of players to play with? If so, either would work well. If not a tank might be a better bet as you can pretty much join/create a group any time you want.
---
1kN is such a unique zone! The only canyon in the game, has a bunch of monoliths (polyliths?), And has the salt flats! Major Southwest US vibes
---
I'm a good resto druid as well! This guy was just super lame.
---
Blizzard has stated they want to protect the "original/classic/vanilla WoW experience" and that was a big reason they stopped the original lfg addon.
---
Sorry, but I don't think the creators intended after making huge zones with many quests(yes, often generic and repeated objectives) that players would spend 15 levels at Scarlet Monastery running the same small dungeon over and over. Then move on to ZF and then brd, etc...
---
You can call it smart use of game mechanics... Faster... Smarter/better players. But i personally don't like it. You can like it, I don't. We all have our own views...
---
&gt; I understand this, you understand this, and so does the person that will roll need anyway.
---
Then it's the group's job to kick them from the group and ruin their reputation.
---
You don't pre-emptively do something shitty because somebody else might.
---
Absolute nonsense. If it's a valuable BOE such as Gut Ripper. You can need it and sell it for Edguards. You don't just get handed hundreds of gold for free.
---
I’ll change my quote to “high ascii” 
---
It’s typically understood that you’re talking about that.
---
Awesome sounds good!
---
Your definition of being an ass is telling someone who was purposefully trying to loot something because someone else was doing all the work to get to the chest that they don't get the loot. Idk, agree to disagree.
---
What? Retail is literally all time gated grinds which is exactly what everyone hates about BfA. You can't play through the story at your own pace because Blizzard has decided that for you already. Flying is all time gated rep grinds that take way too much time because they got rid of tabards. The Azerite neck needed to be grinded on every single alt that you want to play alongside the essences so alt leveling is a complete waste of time and basically dead in the current expansion. 
---
Nobody wants content that takes forever to grind through and they also don't want content that is time gated. It's why classic is fun. You can do shit at your own pace for the majority of the stuff. You can't do that in retail anymore because if you miss a day of grind then you are now a full day behind from getting whatever it is you wanted.
---
cat durid is 4 fite!
---
Menu&gt;interface options&gt;social&gt;ignore chat channel invites
---
This is not exploiting
---
Crusader arena was shit, i forgot about that! i loved the raids tho in wrath, mostly agreee with what youre saying tho.
---
Subjectively. Choosing to exchange the value of the item on the AH for the value of equipping it is up to you.
---
But objectively it is worth the same to everyone in gold on the AH.
---
Where is the twitch app? Is that a website?
---
Well unfortunately for you, your personal belief does not mean shit in blizzard's eyes. It was an obvious exploit. You had to use scientific notation to get it to work and now they hotfixed it. Move on.
---
Yeah the best thing about classic is most of the raids up until Naxx and AQ40 can all be completed individually. There isn't a hard progression and there is gear the is better on some raids than other. Like on my server, someone got Server First Onyxia before they had killed Rag.
---
I usually start combat and swap over to this spec (starting with subtlety tree) at level 30-32.  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhebotzZhZxMe0cGRo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhebotzZhZxMe0cGRo)  It will do well in PvP and fine in dungeons.  It will not be very good in raids.
---
My first toon back in vanilla was a NE druid.  Got him to about lvl 50 then some friends of mine rolled horde so I made a troll shaman who I played all the way through cata and lvl 85.  Can you tell I like hybrid classes?  Now with classic I've rolled druid again and I am loving it so far!  They can play so many different roles and are great in wpvp.  Thinking I will stick with druid life for a while :)
---
Not really? Your time played from 1-44 doesnt mean its going to take you that long for 44-60. Efficiency matters, and efficiency changes.
---
PVP servers add a metagame experience. Your night spent questing may be subverted by an enemy hunter who ganked you while you were resting. So in kind, you gank them. This devolves into a game of cat and mouse. Or, a high level player camps you and you end up logging off early because you can't get anything done. Or, you get bored questing and spend the entire night camping and ganking others.
---
hey man, they lose to me. I never said I was good
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOGCaOhCZvo) is where I'm getting my information. My threat meter also shows static gain even when I crit.
---
I should add that the guide you are following looks to be a "front stab" spec which was popular on private servers but dont work on classic.
---
Adding new continent takes the high level players out of the main world, which I dislike.... in other words I agree with you.
---
What we call "broken" today were referred to as draeneii in wc3. It was tbc that tied the draenei to eradar.
---
No homogenization pls.
---
Self heals rare, aoe rare, kick rare, stealth rare, pets rare, stuns rare, etc 
---
Don't give everyone everything please for the love of god
---
No idea why blizzard ever made high elf face models so bad back in the day. Why not just copy and paste night elf faces and add the paler skin and green eyes? But instead we get warcraft 3 in game models in wow
---
No, it's really not. As I said in another comment, that item dropped could be a Krol blade and bis for your rogue but your druid tank could sell that blade and buy a bis wardens staff with it. It's equally valuable to both players because of the gold value. It's not ninja'ing to need on it though the group should be told BEFORE rolling that everyone should roll need on it.
---
Armor class
---
There is a small subset of leather armor pieces which have, say, 450 armor instead of 150 that similar ilvl pieces have
---
Those are very, very well itemized for druids since druids multiply that 5x in bear form
---
They are in 5 man's, world drops, raids, etc
---
If it has more armor than you expected on a leather piece, it might be a BIS druid tanking piece and you want to hold onto it
---
You don't understand the mentality of trying to educate people so that they don't keep shitting up groups?
---
Takes a village and all.
---
Exploits guards pathing as they can not get up there.  Most roofs in Gadgetzan guards can't get on top of or shoot you off of.  So you can free cast on people in gadgetzan and exploit the guard pathing.
---
LMAO thats really clever of you. fuck those scummy people who clearly see someone clearing a mob near a chest to get said chest, but run up and open it anyways.
---
That does sound a little funny, but I can see how it’d be frustrating. It seems as though they coordinate on a large enough scale to ensure they’re always coming out on top. In the video I referred to, they all used engineering to take Wintergrasp in one minute.
---
My opinion is slightly different.
---
For the most part + damage is better. However, with frost mages especially, if they are going crit build on the talent tree rather than AOE farm on the frost talent tree, sometimes the INT is just better to increase your crit chance.
---
The reason people say Int over spell damage, is that spell damage doesn't do a lot for AOE-channeled spells like blizzard.
---
While leveling I am a huge fan of the Azure "set" for frost mages, but that's because I go with the crit build.
---
It's really expensive if you want to respec often and only be in tank spec for raids. I plan on leaving my warrior as prot and play other characters to experience the rest.
---
for leveling , go sword  sooooo much easier and faster , just use sinister strike / eviscerate  and your stuns ( cheap shot and kidney shot) no hassle of having to try to get behind the enemy to back stab 
---
in case you dont know this website   [https://shadowpanther.net/leveling.htm](https://shadowpanther.net/leveling.htm)  its a great resource for rogues
---
If I run into 5 mob packs for a big aoe pull and the priests starts healing me although I have bubble up. Seeing 15 elites running towards my healer gives me a heart attack every time.
---
Yep, agree completely.
---
if i remember correctly this was a method some guild used to get world first max level during some xpack. maybe i'm thinking of a different MMO.  i have no clue how it works in classic, though.
---
Definitely includes HoTs. I usually right click HoTs off myself if they’re too early in the fight. Literally let me take some damage and then queue up an efficient big heal. Bear tanks are fortunate in having a giant health pool compared to warriors, so it might be some of my preference as well.
---
Oh are you who people should come to for approval on how to enjoy things?
---
That is a much better argument.  I selfishly want the change because it's a better system and I use it more in my work, and I'd like my life to be more consistent.  But I understand the conversion cost would be astronomical for a change just because "it makes more sense" without any big economic benefit.  
---
Also I admit that most people in their daily lives don't use measurements (or convert between them) often enough to want something easier like metric.  They just need to know a gallon of milk, or a gallon of gas, or that person is 6ft tall.
---
Hmmm I thought Blizzard already started to reduce layering.
---
If you spec HotW, you’ll literally never have to respec. The spec can raid heal, Dungeon tank and DPS as well as be god tier PvP.
---
Gross
---
Non-ASCII would be the most correct thing to call it. Although characters in the 128-255 range are sometimes considered "extended ASCII", ASCII is defined as a seven bit character encoding, so it really only includes the characters in the 0-127 (and even then, when talking about typing, were mostly concerned with the "printable ASCII" subset).
---
Didn't one of the rare mobs have a dagger that was a broken bottle?
---
You got a priest? I bet he doesn't buff ya!
---
Sorry buddy, that doesnt help in PvP against Rogue/player stealth
---
Genuine question: how do you know they work for blizzard?
---
Frostbolt is wirken in 1.5 sekonds, I wish this is how all spells read
---
Only honest people that don't need are going to roll greed on a BoE. It is best if everyone rolls need on them. Otherwise the ninjas will win every time.
---
Thats how it is. Welcome to classic, where mana and threat are a thing.
---
This makes me anxious about what will be left when the honeymoon/nostalgia is over. 
---
Only think about it when I’m off the game though
---
I know exactly what do u feel mate I got almost the same setup :)
---
Is your guild recruiting?  I'm a level 45 on Smolderweb-PVP.  All my friends have almost completely stopped playing.  I try (and mostly succeed) to kill everyone red I see that's not so low it would be a dishonorable kill in the honor system.  I assume you're a PVP guild.
---
Paladins are so gay
---
&gt; uck equipping lvl 40 BoE epics or blues, some of that shit will literally buy our entire party their mount and you’ll just end up vendoring it soon enough.
---
How is that possible? If that level 40 blue can buy the entire party a mount, then it must be a pretty damn good 40 that's not going to be replaced soon or ever.
---
Am hunter, can confirm.
---
Priest damage is very mediocre, and even when specced into shadow, it doesn't really see returns until you finally have Shadowform at 40-45.
---
If you have to pvp, your best bet is to keep dots up, save psychic scream for when weakened soul is active and you can't shield yourself, and be prepared to run. You're just going to be an easy target when solo the majority of the time.
---
Devilsaur *"set"* (only 2 pieces) is bind on equip.
---
Just buy it from someone or AH.
---
I was under the impression that all EST servers are in chi town and all others are in LA
---
When you troll, you get the other person upset not yourself lol. You are the one who seemed the most emotionally charged throughout all of this, I wouldn't try to teach a trolling master class if I were you.
---
Nah. I NEED the money that comes from that BoE more then you need it. I wont roll need though on BoP because that's a dick move. But if you think im going to greed on twink items you are crazy. You will replace that item at the end of the day anyways if you played all day. But that gold could be the difference of multiple days farming
---
As it's classic and it can be streamed etc every one will YOLO to that zone and sheer numbers will overwhelm anyone trying to control access to those mobs.
---
Yes, you get less from mobs in either direction, but since higher levels give more xp generally, the reduction is less noticeable. Also xp is reduced when another play or NPC does MORE damage than you do.
---
&gt;No, he's hitting it on the head
---
Proceeds to explain the differences. 
---
That dude is pretty much the expert on tanking in Classic.  He's spent more time in Naxx than you've spent in the game.  He is not a joke.  
---
He doesn't have a shield because if you knew anything about Vanilla tanking, at a certain point it is no longer about mitigation, but more about threat generation so DPS can be increased and fights end quicker.  
---
His list of cons is bigger than the pros, but that's mainly because warriors are superior threat generation.  Mitigation wise they are on par and certainly viable.   
---
Every competitive guild will have AT LEAST one druid tank just because of the diversity they bring to the raid for different situations.
---
I would just dispel you with my Priest.

Using hyperbole isn't the best way to get a point across.
---
Yeah pretty much every day after 4 PM there are queues
---
I mean private server classic players are the ones who stomped the content and world Forster everything.
---
AOE dungeon clearing isn’t some new concept. I used to do it with my step brother to grind xp and gear.
---
What is there to catch up to? This isn’t a race to the finish.
---
Yep. A major side effect of all these appalling groups is that tanks don't have range to do anything. Most of my groups, you're lucky if taunt isn't on cooldown.

How'd you get SexyMap to work? Even with the 1.13 version it just has options to lock/unlock, nothing else.

People who suck a bag of dicks at pvp so they spend hours on end camping lowbies in zones 15+ levels lower than them.
---
I love pvp servers, I've played open pvp servers/games since before wow even existed, I'll happily smash a lowbie into the ground and move along my merry way to help facilitate faction hostility, but  fuck you if the best you can do is camp a much lower area for multiple hours. Have some self respect.
---
I can understand different perspectives. You prefer TBC. I understand that just fine.
---
What I can't understand is someone who prefers TBC, coming to Classic where you know people prefer Classic, and saying "TBC or bust."

Obviously you never played paladin

Wow classic &gt; retail

Don't forget the sub lasts 30 days, some may just be getting their moneys worth.

Or think they are then 3 years later wonder what happened

That makes more sense as i didnt understand how the add on was gathering that information. I don't use the add but had turned it on for a brief bit to see what all the whining was about. In that case, the add on really doesnt bother me personally.
---
It really is. I have been having a blast in Classic. Had a horde rouge gank my escort NPC in Red Ridge. It kicked off some wonderful world PVP. I was pissed that I failed the quest but impressed as well. 
---
Fun times.

A shaman exchange some with me for some buffed meals with +4stamina and +4spirit

it also says. Restricted content **MAY** be removed.

that would suggest a possibility, not to be confused with definitely.
---
I'm sorry did you mean mage or priest next to rogue?
---
Add-ons cannot smart buff/debuff people, because that led to the decursive fiasco/arms race in Vanilla, and I think this patch is after that was already removed.
---
As an enhancement Shaman, I am both insulted and empathetic to your sentiment. :(
---
Don't waste your mana topping everyone off after every pull. Doing so adds a considerable  amount of time to the run.
---
Yoooo. DURFS! I do love a rock solid Son of Stone. Very awesome art.
---
I fucking knew I wasn't crazy. I could have sworn I remembered some sort of looking for group tool using the meeting stones. When I didn't know anything I tried to use one once and there was like 1 other person in it. Everyone has been talking like that never existed and I thought I was losing my mind.

Oof. This priest did literally everything wrong, starting with not having enough Mana.

I keep my feed filtered to "new" for this very reason. The mods really do need to look at this further.

I did a quest with someone, it went well, we said ty and disbanded the group.

He messaged me after and goes "I just read your name correctly, are you Palestinian?"

I said yes, we exchanged a word or two in Arabic (I don't speak the language well)

We continued chatting for a little bit, turns out we live less than 3 miles from each other, blew my mind.

I use to be horde only. I’m going alliance right now though. Started horde but the 9 hour ques to play on whitemane with friends the first week got old quick. So I went alliance on another server and am enjoying the fresh experience. Though I still think for the alliance sounds lame. Still “identify” as horde.

That's my end goal, dunno what else to tell ya. I'm still enjoying classic. And I don't have anything negative to say about it.
---
No he was going to tanaris.
---
Sometimes you see a bit deeper into the game to understand the negative impact it has on the game. If you are talking about speedrolling dungeons, that is not alright and the design was never meant to be steamrolled as it is now. Just because players can do it, doesnt mean its right and healthy for the game
---
Those same people are going to be wondering why nobody will group with them in a few months. Seems some people are forgetting we don't have xrealm groups and shit in classic lol.
---
Ah, bummer.
---
I am level 47 and aoe farming dungeons is amazing. Definetly better than solo leveling as ret.
---
The spy addon doesn't tell you WHERE an enemy is. It just tells you that there is one around you. Nameplates told you where, even through walls. That's the key difference.
---
Banning the spy addon is essentially impossible without literally destroying half of the addons we use. The spy addon uses the combat log to warn the player. Start messing around with the combat log and say goodbye to dps meters, weak auras, etc etc.
---
Tell them you are done and then fast say something like bb or cya and leave group.
---
Ohh okay I see I was misunderstanding what you were saying.  That makes complete sense
---
I think a lot of the m+ dungeon spam mentality bled in to where now lots of players think that's the most efficient way to play the game.
---
And then what? "Time capsules" just result in nobody playing except the extremely hardcore all spread out on different servers.
---
He kept coming back to harass me too haha. We both got each other a few times, I thought this was funny tho.
---
What program for the controls from phone?
---
It does? I had no idea
---
I'm a hunter. I pull and I loot. That's it.
---
Most of the original WoW developers came from a game called EverQUEST lol. Granted you usually just grinded mobs to level in EQ there were still quests. WoW isn’t the first MMO it was just the first hugely popular one.
---
I don’t remember having to do this in vanilla.
---
If you want one to go to you, you have to set the pet to attack something other than the only one you have solid aggro on.
---
All incoming damage generates rage. Give me more rage so I can spam more swipes.
---
Yes because it was less grindy than everquest or the alternatives. It had quality of life over other games like not losing levels when you die. 
---
Gaming has changed over the past decade including wow. I think a lot of wow players will check it out as a novelty and then nope out. I say this as someone who was in the vanilla beta.
---
Getting a WF proc and sword spec proc at the same time as a warrior was the dream
---
Classic+ OR tbc is inevitable. TBC is also very likely due to it also being a very popular and loved expansion and it would require a fraction of  the work to make work because a ton of the ground work was already done with classic. 
---
Classic+ means a lot of developer hours into designing new stuff, a lot of risk from that stuff not being accepted by the community, and overall medium risk with high reward. TBC is low risk high reward but it's not very sustainable since after wrath well.. whats then?
---
There would be no issues because any raid guild will make sure their main tank gets gear priority. In this circumstance a warrior tank helmet dropped. The only other warrior in the group was a DPS spec. Which is even more reason why he took the helm.
---
Ah yes, you're right.
---
Man, I'm 42 and I'm 1/0/31
---
Good luck getting spirit taps in a 5 man
---
He secretly just doesn't want to share leather with you.
---
Myzrael represent!
---
Yes, that’s what I’ve said - ez levels are high in classic.
---
lol i know the gear, just didnt understand your position on things. .
---
I think we are arguing different points, so ill move on.
---
my original feelings stand, Greed if you will not equip, if you **WILL** equip need.
---
So that last warlock macro, does it automatically cast the highest rank of immolate you have? Cause I have "cast Immolate (Rank x) in mine and had to update each time I upgraded it so far. Also is there any way to tell which one it's actually casting to confirm?
---
Inspiration hit day 1 when I made him

There's a new test version (v0.2.5b) if you like to test :)

Ye I spends days building and writing a UI that is build around nameplates...

took me over an hour to even get halfway through the searing tongue quest.
---
How do you add macros because the ones you have a really basic stuff.
---
&lt;laughs in healer placing Post-it over your group portait&gt;
---
Priest healer here. I know not to bubble warriors but how does renew affect rage generation?
---
This is not the first time.
---
yeah cause people generally say what did you just type?... jesus dude try harder
---
He is doubling down, Cotton. This will not bode well.
---
Let us see how this plays out
---
I'm with you except when people make blatantly threats racists, homophobic, or sexist remarks. That's when there's a line crossed.  Threats, sexism, and homophobic remarks that are directed at someone as a person, and racism should never ever be tolerated, on the internet or not it's not cool.
---
Last time I played or even talked about WoW with someone I know IRL was like 7 years ago.
---
Only one of my coworkers plays games, but she only plays like Fortnite and shit.
---
Can squat 4 1/2 gnomes

I thought I saw a couple of different stings on initial watch, but point-rewatching missed it.

---
Keep running the quest, stay if you can, thank them for group if you can't.
---
Usually it's cool to stay on ones that need X number to be killed but ones where yoy need items with low drop rates....totally understandable if you want to bounce.
---
-cheers
---
I need my own show
---
That is not slowing down the run. Slowing down the run is when people wipe and have to walk back because they DIDNT give the tank 3 full seconds.
---
You sound like your mother.
---
I quested with a dude for 45 minutes in EPL. I randomly got removed from the group and whispered “sorry man I already have too many friends, good luck” 😂👍
---
Leave now before you lose your life

---
Haha that would be pretty funny tbh, I'd just stand there wondering what happened
---
Is this opensourced? I'm a frontend developer and wouldn't mind giving you a hand on this if you want.
---
Where do we report bugs btw?
---
There was a post explaining why sunder is better than heroic strike. Im not a warrior, but maybe others can give you a link
---
Yeah, there are quite a few things in World of Warcraft that aren't very realistic!
---
Every Reddit post comment section is about druids now i feel like, are we reallllly the underdog now?
---
It IS suboptimal. It IS a meme spec in the sense of people make jokes about people thinking it is optimal
---
Lol I hope people dont take this seriously.  Shamans are literal free kills to hunters unless you have a no skill low iq player like in the video.  Please if you're new to classic, dont listen to this guy.
---
Oh also. Druids have a scream and 2 taunts as well.
---
You mention more choices for tanking. But really, unless you're in a premade group, you're generally running sword and board defensive stance.
---
And faerie fire is a way better ranged pull than a bow.
---
I still agree warriors are the go to tanks for end game, but I think whilst levelling druids have the better tool set for tanking.
---
You say one revenge and the mob is stuck. That requires a dodge doesnt it?
---
One maul on my druid and nobody can pull it off unless I legit just auto it. And usually it will stick to me until it's almost dead anyways.
---
And not to mention it doesn’t really make sense coming from someone browsing reddit lol
---
Kom får ni titta
---
That's what like 112 lbs?
---
Sorry to disappoint. I’m actually a dumbass and never asked
---
You should absolutely not play this game as if it's your own personal game. It's quite literally not. Taking a BoE from someone who was going to equip it, even if in the min/max pserver lootguide tell you you're supposed to sell it on the AH, is selfish and greedy.
---
Equipping purples is fun. Letting someone else have fun isn't a mistake.
---
Really? There’s been a ton of them...
---
This speaks to me.
---
Also you can always ask a city guard where stuff is.
---
LFR KJ gives me nightmares
---
Ashenvale is pretty dope. I leveled my warrior in Stonetalon in vanilla and remembered it being a cluster fuck. Went to Ashenvale this time instead on my shaman and really enjoyed the zone. Very cool looking area and the little bits of lore are great. I did get to party up with an awesome Tauren who was going through the area and we quested together for like 5 hours and did practically the entire zone together, so maybe I'm a little biased.
---
You trigger my PTSD. I still remember joining my first battle ground a dozen years ago and instantly being hunted down again and again by some shockadin with his T2 helmet hurling a fucking comet down on me!
---
I’m interested in doing this too. I’m level 12 so nothing I have is good at 60 LW. Which level do the stuff have demand and people without LW might buy?
---
Orc's as rogues, Tauren as Druid. It's also a game
---
About the same range as one using a longish pole.
---
Can you do this with the models from the Dressing Room, so you can gear it up the way you want?
---
The best I seen was a guild whose recruitment was all about how they are "stoner friendly" They gm got so much shit from people. I couldn't tell if he was trolling, but I'm imagining him being some young kid whose never smelled it in his life trying to recruit people who could look cool too.  Other than that I haven't ran across this too much.  Nothing that got under my skin.
---
Don't use rend and stop buying ranks of it. Charge, auto until you can HS, repeat until execute. Cleave on 2 targets. No zerker unless you need to intercept, you can't afford the incoming damage and rage loss, and if you're fighting 3 or 4 things where ww might be appropriate you're already dead.
---
Poor lad...

The first blue item to replace one of the pieces will do it.
---
I know right. It blows my mind too, because whether you're playing Retail or Classic, you're paying the same subscription.
---
LOK'TAR!
---
It is like 2 years too early too talk about classic plus lol. We are aware that it wont last forever but definantly will be fun for a loooooong time.

God you are just insufferable. I'm not even the first guy you started your little rant with, bit somehow you feel the need to insult rather than discuss.

30-40 is a level range designed to separate casuals from more serious players.
---
There is no singular zone on either faction that has a perfect 30-40 leveling experience. You could go to one or two zones exclusively from 18-30, but from 30-40 you are likely going to be exploring 3-5 zones with minimal quests in each in order to check off your quests and grab exp.
---
This is by design. It's meant to be tough. You're on the home stretch towards your level 40 mount and once you hit your mount the game opens up in a whole new way. Level 30-40 is tough and a slog for almost everyone because you are on your way to earning your mount and the game starts to go from "Easy-Mode Casual" to "Do you actually know how to play the game yet? Let's test you." **A lot of players will wash out in the level 30-40 range.**
---
30-40 is meant to test you, to defeat you, and more importantly, to make you realize how fucking useful and rewarding receiving your level 40 mount is. It's the pain that makes the reward worth it. Getting your mount at 40 literally changes the game in ways you probably wont realize till you receive it. The *work* you put in 30-40, is worth the *reward* you get at 40.
---
A lot of seasoned players will *not* spend a lot of time questing in the level 30-40 range. Instead, most seasoned players know that grinding out the four versions of Scarlet Monastery is by far the most efficient leveling process.
---
This is good for two reasons. 
---
One, you are encouraged to go level in Scarlet Monastery and learn more serious dungeon mechanics. Earlier dungeons are easier than Scarlet Monastery, but Monastery really starts to hammer home real dungeon mechanics that are a little less forgiving. From 1-30, you can mostly skip dungeons. From 30 onward, Dungeons are going to be a bigger part of the game. You *can* still level without dungeons, but the experience and more importantly the *loot* you get from dungeons makes things easier. Dungeoning is a big part of the game, and SM teaches you how to learn better mechanics for when you reach harder dungeons.
---
Two, the game begins seriously testing your knowledge and starts punishing you for not knowing what you're doing. You had 30 levels to learn your class, get a feel for how the world works, get a taste of W-PVP if you're on a PVP server, get a handle on professions and everything else. But *now*, the game wants to know you've learned along the way. It starts to test you, but it actively does this because the game gets *harder* going forward. Do not conflate *harder* with *more tedious*. The game after level 40 gets a lot easier for leveling, but it also stops holding your hand. You are a full fledged player at level 30, and the game tests you from 30-40 to make sure you're ready for what comes after.
---
And trust me when I saw, what comes after 40 is worth the level 30-40 slog to get there.
---
Which is an argument that *actually* has nothing to do with P1999.
---
Everyone does wants something different. Personally, an unchanging Naxx-era Classic would be a "shit experience" for me - I'm enjoying the game now but I definitely think it'll have an expiration date exactly the same way vanilla did for me 13 years ago.
---
The easy route for Blizz would be to take a page from EQ and give people the version they want. You could have your unchanging classic, I could have BC, people who want WotLK could have that I guess. Classic+ is the only one that requires any sort of effort on Blizz's part.
---
I live in indiana, heartseeker has the same time as me. 453pm currently.
---
Wait what? What happens when you drop it? It's gone or you gotta loot it back up?
---
Probably because they don't have a full time job / took time off.
---
I don't think there's people out there balancing a full time job sleep and hitting 60 in 2 weeks.
---
Undeads could be hunters. St least thats what I imagined when skeletons in warcraft 3 used bows.
---
Your entitled to feel how you wanna feel. As I said to someone else. I play a warrior and Edgemasters dropped. I didn't get it a rogue got it and the entire group needed. I wasn't upset because for me this is standard etiquette. The rogue can sell it and buy a Krol Blade or Gutt ripper which are his BiS items. So I'm not that upset about it.
---
This is a difference in view in what the etiquette should be. Your acting like my view is selfish. As if everyone needing results in me automatically getting what I want. It doesn't.
---
Of course its an alliance that says that :P  
---
 World PvP means world, nowhere is safe.
---
Mages are like half the classic population so it's easy enough to find one that will give rude people water
---
Horde are mostly alright, but undead rogues and tauren warriors are consistently THE WORST on my server
---
Gold income scales with levels (your time is more valuable at 60 than at 37, so you should aim to get there). I personnally would keep leveling and get the mount at a higher level. Only buy MUST have abilities
---
The only way you are going to fake that is by:
---
A) having both people physically behind the same NAT router
---
B) having both people behind the same NAT router via a VPN tunnel
---
Something most people aren't going to bother with or even know how to do.  You can't just tell Blizzard hey I'm connecting from this IP If you aren't actually connecting from that IP.  The communication has to go two ways and if you are spoofind you IP the server would have no way of responding to you.  If the situation is A then chances are those people live in the same place and share the account anyways.  It's also probably to Blizzard's benefit to do anything they can to encourage people to log in to retail.  They could even allow authentiation by both clients only when the Classic client is in queue and then give a warning when you hit the button to log in to the Classic world after the queue pops that your retail client will be logged out.
---
I was levelling prot pally until yesterday, we go through mana like an arcane mage. I'd always tip 10-15s for 2 stacks of water, it still costs the mage time.
---
The human's not being hunters thing I believe is just based off of WC3 because humans weren't the race that used guns/bows.
---
So you are saying druids are better at tanking?
---
Or to say that even those we assume are bad can be good, and that those we assume are good can be bad.
---
Not really, the full exp from mob kills out paces quest grinding and you'll run out of quests and have to grind out many levels manually due to too much grouping for content designed to be soloed.
---
Exp gets nerfed hard when you group up especially if your pet members are higher than you.
---
My only gripe with it is how some races have more options like others like Trolls and Humans have plenty to choose from but Tauren and Gnome can only pick from 4
---
other than that I dont really mind the restrictions
---
I know if I respec'd my paladin to prot I'd get zero invites.
---
i was walkin in hillsbrad and my stomach started grumbling and i just shitted everywhere and it was so embarrassing i dont think ill ever forget it
---
Good luck getting hand of justice!
---
I was on the road running back to Menethil as a level 25 dwarf priest, crossed paths with a level 13 night elf warrior who promptly whispered me, asking if I played a tauren shaman in wotlk (same name). Couldn't believe it! 
---
We talked a bit, he said how he had kept in touch with the old guild since then, and I gave him a link to their discord server
---
They make the world that much smaller. Much of the beauty of a good MMORPG is the immersive world and being a part of it. Granting groups the ability to have the majority of players just stand in a city while they are being summoned to a location shrinks the game into an instanced dungeon crawler loot simulator much like in retail. Summoning stones are the first step on a path to BFA. 
---
The reason why using a lock to summon is okay is as follows: 
---
1. It requires more people.
---
2. It requires reagents
---
3. It's a higher level spell
---
4. You have to do it in the open world
---
5. Its exclusive to warlocks
---
Part of the problem with WoWs decade and a half lifespan is the continued slippery slope of "quality of life" adjustments. These adjustments seem innocuous at first, but each time one is made it has a greater and greater negative effect on the game.
---
This same argument can and is used against flying mounts, lfg, group finder, lfr, low level mounts. Much of mmorpg content is player interaction, not only with groups but also against the other faction.
---
&gt;btw the summoning stones were the first form of lfd, it was in classic..
---
Great, you can listen to wow podcasts and learn fun facts. 2.0.1 was when summoning stones were added. That is TBC. There was a brief period when they tested the Meeting Stones in vanilla as a sort of match making, it was complete shit and just put random people (usually 5 dps) in a group. Hardly something that existed in classic. Also this didnt teleport you anywhere. It just grouped you.
---
Wotlk arenas sucked as a rogue. Suddenly everyone got dots, bleeds, stuns, aoe which fuck rogues, but blizzard didn’t care. The carefully tuned 1v1 balance went out the window in favor of infinite cc and insane burst, essentially turning the game into an FPS reflex-fest. 
---
I hated it, but I was patient. My patience was never rewarded before I quit the stupid game. Now I’m glad classic is back :) classic is not tbc, but I still remember enjoying it a lot more than other expansions... I will still miss arenas though.
---
Nope I have seen plenty of these posts complaining about other post types though.
---
I can almost guarantee you that there will be no kinda of expansion for classic. That’s all just silly wishful thinking.
---
Glad to see we've resolved this incredibly confusing and damaging situation for you.
---
I think you are approaching the game incorrectly. Games have different experiences for many players because they all play the game in different ways. Games have goals but the way you approach those goals is up to you.
---
WoW Classic is a *literal re-release* of the First WoW experience (idk what patch exactly but the release itself is same as it was back in 04-05). This means everyone starts from absolute scratch and the economy doesn't exist. This is why 1-30 was amazing for you. Who doesn't love that first experience of an RPG where everyone around you is trying to reach the same goal as you and has the same in-game experience as you? But you've reached a point where you separate yourself from those who play quick hours a day either because of scheduling or they feel satisfied with a single level for a day, and the players who play many hours and want to reach the end game no matter what. I understand you want to be 60, or level quicker, but if those methods are forcing you to have a negative reaction to the game play, you really need to decide whether you are approaching the game properly or quit the game because you are really just wasting your time. Maybe you can stop leveling, do some profession training, PvP with guilds, help lower levels get through dungeons. It’s an RPG, role play the character you would be in the setting WoW has set for you, which is really stunning by the way, the Tauren story line is amazing so far for me. Just find a different way to play the game that still allows you to reach that end game. If all that doesn’t interest you and just want to reach end game but the grind is boring, quit or play retail WoW. I highly suggest you don’t waste any more of your time if you really think something you are supposed to be enjoying is a chore for you.
---
Blizzard didn't remove need/greed from options for BoP items, so there is no reason to treat them different because you're greedy.
---
My server is one of the lowest populated servers with at least 5k people online at any given moment. Scans show about 40k log in over a day. Even if you assume half are alts, you're getting close to 1 million people online across the world.  Multiply my number by 5 for a super conservative estimate. Now you're the top 0.05%.  Order of magnitude is still the same. It's all in the noise of the data anyway. I can't statistically prove that it's 0.01% or 0.07%, but I can sure as hell know that it's not 0.3%.
---

Just raid as ret and get the weapon bro

If you're casual, raid progression is slow. Especially stuff like Naxx are things you don't clear in a single evening...
---
I have literally never saw this or I am not reading the chat enough. I am on Whitemane.

That spirit tap return is unreliable in dungeons though.
---
Feel more like an arcane thing to me, like some weird accident some mage came across and was like “wait I can use this”
---
Every class can run dungeons

I honestly wish this was me intentionally being wordy to try and win an argument, and not a showcase of the level of thought I invest into completely meaningless things in my life. Though that may be a bit too realistic of an answer to that. Hahaba
---
Furor -&gt; Improved MotW - No feral talents let alone charge, what are you going to do with it?
---
Moonfury -&gt; Gift of Nature - Also agree on this 10% to all your healing beats 10% on some of your damage spells.
---
Moonglow should probably be picked up, its too good for mana efficiency to skip. 3 pts for 9% reduction on many of your spells vs Tranquil spirit 5 pts for 10% reduction on Healing Touch.
---
I would pick something more like this [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0xhMxsZZxtcofq](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0xhMxsZZxtcofq) if you still want to forgo feral charge. Nature's Reach is really nice to have but could be dropped for more reliable roots if preferred. Tranquil spirit could be moved to pushback resistance as well.
---
God damn teleporting gators
---
My old vanilla guild had Druid only vs pally only runs, we would race! Druids almost always won. I healed back then
---
Lol "roasted" by blind 40 year old basement dwellers who want to shit on a guy who actually has valid criticism about their nostalgic "can do no wrong" remake.
---
Y'all are a mistake. This retarded example of a purely broken class and rampant narcissism should have negative votes but you just eat it up in the name of """community""" and fail to realize this. Is. Broken. Gameplay.
---
I mean, I can just FD and live no matter what so if y'all wanna just die with healing go ahead lol
---
I think it was best put by a guildmate:
---
"When I am about to do a pull and this dude comes running in and agrro's 4 mobs, expecting me to help, whilst I am low hp, I just heal up and watch how this is gonna turn out"
---
There was sage wisdom in that comment, I continue to learn from it, to this day.
---
Haha, can confirm, tried this yesterday and it did not end well.
---
how is hillsbrad "20-30" when the lowest quest is 30, and all the mobs are 31+?
---
this is not accurate at all
---
Going to say the same thing i said in an early post:
---
i hear where you are coming from. If we are talking less than 5% upgrade i could be swayed to have a free roll. However, as a classic community promoter, the right thing is to help someone level. We are really early in the launch, a lot of levelers and some could really use the help. Support them. Build them up, never know what they send you in the mail later.
---
At the end of the day, there is no right answer... just the truth. I just hope i get to play with more like minded people that look to uplift the community and not necessarily put ourselves first.
---
unconsolidated advice - if you need mount money, there are BY FAR faster and easier ways to get it than trying to hustle a BOE in the current AH market...
---
Wish you well!
---
Open a ticket right?  You could in vanilla so that's gotta be a mistake
---
I should really join an all druid guild.
---
Is there some way to get a list of all the guilds? With like there specialities?
---
"Classic+ is obviously the best way to go if you have faith in Blizzard’s developers learning from the past and believe they can make a proper product."
---
yeh i dont, and therefore just keep recycling what COMPETENT people have produced over ten years ago. They would be stupid to let anyone from new WoW have a hand in fucking around with the old shit. Much safer to continue to recycle the first 3 expacs for the next 10 years and farm the nostalgia like a cash cow, instead of letting some intern write new burning crusade and ruin the whole cash train.
---
The announcement from Blizzard that Classic WoW was being released was made on **Nov 3rd 2017**. 
---
This Classic WoW subreddit was created on **April 23rd 2016**, \~1.5 years before anyone even knew Classic was coming out....
---
Clearly the mods here are affiliated with Blizzard.  
---
It isn't right that posts that are "bad for business" get censored.  That's not what Reddit is about.  It's shameful that this subreddit is being used as a marketing platform under the guise that it's a place where we can come together to talk about our favorite game.  That's pretty shady.  
---
I hope folks smarten up and understand what's going on here.
---
I encountered this exact same bug in the yeti cave in Alterac lol - such a letdown.
---
Anyone know if you actually could in vanilla? Maybe it's just a PS thing.
---
I’m using big picture mode for steam download the app called steam link on the AppStore and set it up. There’s a post about it on this subreddit.
---
Its been trending off and on since launch.   Funniest was when it was #2 and #1 was r/relationship_advice :D

---
You wouldn't even need an "escrow guild" you would need one guy who is trusted. All he's doing is taking your gold. Logging on to BFA and trading you gold. 
---
There's no need for a wallet, journal, some accountant in a dimly lit room, or pretty much any traceability other than screenshots of whispers. Even that's going overboard. The stuff on EVE is way overboard for what is needed. The only similarity is that somebody is being trusted. Fantastic. 
---
If that one guy is know to be legit, he takes his cut and transfers the gold. That's all he's doing.
---
Damn gonna have to reroll
---
&gt; Just cast the heals, keep the guy up; the taunt
---
can miss
---
May be a dumb question, but how does everyone take these videos when something like this happens? Or do people just have every moment of the game being recorded?
---
Isn't it the same as in Diablo 3 where every distance is in yards in English but meters in German. But the actual distance in game is the same.
---
There was a guy looking for an LGBTQ+ realm some days ago, I guess we found it.
---
They're going to do TBC because classic+ probably costs a ton (depending on scope) in development money, and relaunching TBC doesn't now that they've laid the groundwork with classic.
---
I could do either tbh. I loved Ghostlands and Tranquillien levelling up horde though at the same time I'd happily transfer my vanilla main over to hit Outlands right away and help along my alts.
---
Can run yes. Can run to get really good exp no. Hunters and rogues for example are terrible for the dungeon farms. Rogue works kinda okay below lvl36, but after that none will inv you because a warrior does about 50% more dps.
---
You dont need to respec. Heal as Feral
---
AFAIK, they haven’t said as much. They did confirm that servers has far fewer layers than players were assuming/claiming.

The vast majority of opinions regard more than just the person who holds the opinion... The game has been out just over a week, if you're so out of stuff to do then I would regard you as playing it wrong, not the people taking their time. Your opinion affects people too, yet you seem pretty content to have it, everyone's is valid.
---
I leveled a warrior to 16, stopped leveled a hunter to 32. Stopped because finding dungeons sucked. So I went back to my warrior last night. Makes me feel better about grouping but fuck questing as him
---
Everyone here needs to read about Tirion Fordring and Eitrigg in Of Blood and Honor!  Can't we all just get along?!   :)
---
omg I'm stupid... 😅 oh well, haven't played drums for quite some time. I do miss it, tho'.
---
Nah dude, you're wrong. Naxx isn't hard, and streamers/hardcore guilds have nothing to do with it. 
---
By time naxx comes out, almost everyone who is going to raid will be ready for it, and it will be pugged to completion in the first week. Counting people that are level 47 months and months after classic released as people who 'will never get to see naxx' is stupid, they aren't the target audience for raids. Everybody who thinks of themselves as a 'raider' in classic wow will almost inevitably clear naxx.
---
The point i'm making is, you are vastly overestimating how difficult naxx was, and how awful everyone was 15 years ago. People thought the same thing about MC and Ony, and they were pugged in the first 2 weeks of the game being released. in a month or two, you'll be able to hop into a random LFG group for MC and clear the whole thing in a couple hours without wiping, barely having to think about it. It'll be like doing LFR.
---
If you think i'm wrong, please tell me which fights are hard in naxx and why :)
---
This actually helped me.  Now i can fish at work.

Phase 2.
---
Yeah anyone been playing long enough knows thats why you dont do that lol
---
lmao i'm actually on kromcrush ally too! I think it might be because I leveled slightly out of the main zerg and sometimes play at off-hours, but I haven't been attacked by the opposite faction much at all after level ~40 or so.
---
I just give them a wave when I see them, they do the same, and we carry on our way.
---
I even helped one doing the feralas homing chicken escort because that is the most frustrating quest in the entire damn game
---
lolno
---
Its not a resto spec, its actually a balence spec that healers run when they have no gear because its mana conservative. Its actually a balence spec since its more specced into damage and reduced mana consumption than it is healing.
---
Yeah saw a guy accidentally jump off a zeppelin while jumping around aimlessly. 
---
I laughed so hard I clicked the side button of my mouse which I bind to auto run and fell off as well...
---
That’s going to be stuck in my head. Until the end of time.
---
On my server (Fairbanks) the price jumps once you get heavy leather.
---
It's seriously stupid to be able to attack something with ranged abilities and not be able to see it's name plate info or the mobs immediately near by.
---
Lots of salty rogues lol
---
Soda is doing it
---
Does this have classic servers because I don't see them?
---
Your wrong, I think all streamers are disgusting.
---
Your a warrior, right?  While leveling you don’t need to spec prot to tank.  Throw on a shield, and tank for yourself.
---
Tanks aren’t crazy about grouping with dps warriors, it cuts into drops they need for their solo efforts.
---
Atiesh is amazing and I couldn't imagine a friendlier community. I have a lvl 30s human and a lvl 20 forsaken and both sides have been everything I could ask for in a playerbase. Was on the first wave of servers, so very well populated, but I stopped getting queue times after the first week.

When I first started out I decided I wanted Kings as early as possible just to have a nice buff to spam on everyone while running around questing. So I went Improved Devo, Redoubt, Kings, Shield Spec. Then I dumped points in Toughness and Anticipation to get to Blessing of Sanctuary. If I reset I think I'd move those points over to Precision and IRF instead though.
---
I usually have Devo Aura on all the time by default but if fighting greens I may swap to Ret Aura, or if another pally is in the group then whoever has the highest Devo Aura runs that and the other can run Ret or Conc depending if we have casters.
---
I've messed around a lot trying to figure out what combo of blessings, seals, and auras is best for solo farming. Devo + Sanc + Judge Light &gt; Righteousness is the ultimate for survivability and zero downtime, but the slowest to kill things. Ret + Might + Judge Crusader &gt; Righteousness for all out damage, but my experience is it's not actually in practice all that much quicker to kill things. I switch to that usually only when I'm grouped up and we're killing stuff so fast that nobody is taking any damage. If I'm legit tanking then it seems like the added downtime and mana exhaustion from healing more makes it more trouble than it's worth.
---
Tanking dungeons I usually stick with Devo + Sanc and then I may Judge Crusader &gt; Righteousness if the group is slow killing things. I feel like Devo + Sanc makes it much easier on the healer, but I'm not convinced that Crusader is worth the mana, so now that I have Light I'll probably start using that instead. I use Light now all the time when soloing or in open world groups cause it's less downtime for everyone.
---
The Sunken Temple class quests are not in the game currently. Expected to be added in Phase 2.
---
 Not in this patch dude
---
# Enemy interrupt tracker like Omnibar?
---
Does any one know of an addon like Omnibar for classic? thanks.
---
Hahaha. Try being level 60 mage and the water you make is only 45. No 55 water until DM releases. Best water in game is 60s per 5 from AD rep.
---
one of my computer runs classic just fine, its an old inyel quad with radeon hd 6400 and 4gb of ddr2 rams. You can still tune the video settings for more performance.
---
It has 100% to do with project 1999, it is a recreation of EverQuest before Luclin, which MANY did not like.  So idk what you're getting off at
---
I 100% agree with having a server for each expansion
---
You clearly don’t pvp.
---
Shadow has the worst mana of all casters.
---
6-7 casts and I’m completely oom.
---
Layers have ruined this aspect of the game.

Little do they know hpally roll on cloth ;)

---
Damn, what are the chances lol!
---
This sounds about right...I remember all my English teachers and even my aunt drilling it in my head it’s a rule to not use those words! So basically because it sounds better people just said it was a rule.
---
What's actually happening here is the ore thinks it's outside, so when you go into the cave it culls it out of the picture (which is what the game does to things you're not looking at to save resources). If you zoom your camera out enough or angle it in some funky way the ore will be visible while you're standing next to it
---
Really? Wow, that makes more sense because other people I talked to said they hadn’t done it yet. Ok thanks.
---
Yeah lock is there for pulling with his demon eye thing
---
-5 intellect
---
Hes a lazy orc
---
It's the exact same kind of posts prior to release. "You shouldn't level in groups!" or "You shouldn't use a quest guide!". I have no idea why these casual players insist on people playing or thinking like they do.
---
Personally, I found the rogue harder to level.
---
N
---
Wow ,what an original idea lol
---
Yes it's related to the game but in the weakest sense, cosplay/fan art shit like that just takes over a sub after so long until that's all that's left.
---
That's how long it took people to find it.
---
Yeah let's just all equip stuff that we'd rather sell that way everyone gets to end up with less equipment in the end.
---
Ok thanks
---
I refuse to respec!!
---
Thanks
---
Unless you're a warrior.
---
No
---
Hoooold on, is this a thing in retail?
---
Can we make a Wow classic Screenshot sub? I feel there's so much opportunity to share awesome, breathtaking shots of our beloved game.
---
This is like playing a warrior, except the second part.
---
It depends. Some Greens go for maybe 3-5s higher than vendor price. So you buy the item, use it for a few levels, vendor it, and at the end of the day you've only spend a handful of silver since you recoup most of the value back from the vendor.
---
Rogues will compete with mages at 60
---
I'm copy pasting it and it still write the emote in the chat :(
---
yeh but if you arent CCing being closer to the mobs harms your threat generation. the closer you are when you cast a spell on an enemy the more threat you gain.
---
the guild I joined in TBC had a boomkin for every boss even in Naxx in one of the mage groups.
---
I’m willing to bet the horde started that fight.
---
Are you using the steam controller for WoW?
---
G
---
Thank you. Someone gets it.
---
Wait, what server did you play on?
---
Hunter: feign death
---
Windfury totem: Do it for real...biiiitch.
---
If you’re on a newer server suchthe one I’m on, thunderfury. It could be that most people are tinkering in the 20s and low 30s.. just a thought.
---
Upvote for bravery. Truth is treason in an empire of lies.
---
Nothing shitty about it. It gives everyone in the group a fair shot at a very rare drop. 
---
I'm a tank. If a epic tanking BoE drops, I expect everyone to roll need on it. It's the fairest, safest way to go about it. People letting their feelings get in the way of logic.........as usual.
---
Most melee cleave group don't use a tank at all, just gather all the mobs and get them close then start cleaving. Any warrior can taunt a mob off the healer.
---
Same expirience, same solution.
---
Sounds fine to me.
---
I think you'll be okay. I've been around 15-20 people, all committing mass genocide, with no drop. And if I DID have a drop, I've got room to lower my settings. I can't recall which integrated graphics card I have (something that was around in 2014, anyway), but I know I've only got 6GB RAM.
---
&gt; all classic content is going to be torn through very quickly and no one knows where we go from there.
---
what are you talking about ? the vast majority of players will need 18 months to 2 years to tear through the content. Why should we change the game for the top 1% who burned through the game in a week ?
---
How is the information for this gathered? It's just people uploading CensusPlus data, right? I'm surprised it's showing Kurinnaxx at a 2:1 H:A ratio, though it may just be the fact that I'm level 56 and don't see many other players in the world anyways right now.
---
Respect. Top Class Gaming All Around.
---
Context, it's important.
---
Hubba hubba yummy yummy
---
I have let numerous people die because they think they need to pull. All I’m waiting on is my healer get some mana. I really really don’t need that frostbolt you think you just have to shoot right at that moment and pull.
---
Free transfers, they’ve done it for dying servers and then make new ones once those are full again.
---
Whenever i duel a same level or slightly higher warrior on my paladin i always go unarmed and still win. Can confirm that most warriors that are in the orange and even red level range are still winnable unless of course you are a warrior
---
A shame it will end next week, after all, everyone told me classic will be dead in a month.
---
Blood elves were a horde ally in WC3: The Frozen Throne. You play as Kael’Thas.
---
My name is Munging.
---
You can actually still see when they send invites, it just blocks them
---
Careful with your logic around here, people don't like that stuff.
---
Wasn’t me but when I was running around Redridge last night I saw a pair of dwarves named Haymush and Shaymush. They were identical twins and they were leapfrogging over each other as they ran through Lakeshire.
---
Need something?
---
As a Horde I feel like it's human warriors who are the worst on Alliance side. They always seem so... conspiring.
---
The pvp thing will only matter 55+. The game ain’t going nowhere so I’m not rushing lol
---
This has been the case since like.. 3.3 WOTLK with 232  5 mans.
---
It's also the same time that content drought started occurring in every expac!
---
Found the guy that plays on Herod
---
No, but if you are able to read and not say something without having anything to do previous discussed....
---
This person wrote like this topic was BRAND NEW and never discussed before and I pointed out that we discuss this topic for the last 6 months nearly every day.
---
Is reading so hard?
---
I'd invite you for that lol. Bound to be a fun group ;)
---
This is most wonderfully done when you're friends with the healer.  We have a standing agreement that there's no need for the healer to jeopardize the heals by healing some idiot who just decided to pull on their own.
---
This is stated clearly as policy at the start of the party, and ESPECIALLY applies to rogues who pickpocket ahead and hunters or warlocks who "accidentally" pull with their pets/minions.
---
I believe back in BC when warriors started leveling again someone came up what was known as the “Law of Conservation of Rage”.
---
Rage can neither be created nor destroyed only transferred between the player and their character.  They created an addendum for druids stating that Rage exist but it is in an unusable state, mana, until they transform into a bear.
---
This is shown in this thread.  While the warrior character has no Rage the player has it pooled within themselves and is quite angry.  However as the warrior character gains Rage the player begins to calm down, and the rage is being transferred to the character who can now use abilities.  
---
After an ability is used which consumes the resource it leaves the character and is transferred back into the player who becomes angry that the character can not use abilities.
---
This is copied from another post
---
As somebody who played druid in both classic and tbc, don't expect your tbc feral experience to come anywhere near to classic.
---
Feral in't complete garbage in classic as a tank, but they're sooooo much better in tbc comparatively.
---
This feels like a scaled down Lord of the Rings movie. A lot of traveling for some combat. I love it
---
Are resto druids viable healers in classic ?
---
That's pretty self-evident, dude.
---
How many toxic pre-teen boys are signing up to to patiently heal their party as a priest, vs. rolling rogue so that can "shank bitches"?
---
If you don't think that certain personality types are draw to certain game archetypes, then I'm really not sure what to tell you.   Try playing games sometime, I guess.  You'll see.
---
with love from the best server NA
---
ASSCANDY!
---
#NoChanges is important because while some things could be improved, it takes just a few of the wrong changes to ruin complete systems.
---
There are changes to the game caused by players like AoE cleave and those are fine imo.  There should definitely be some limited/controlled content additions and fixes for clunkiness later on, but we really don't need that until the phases are complete.
---
In the end, the point is that WoW is the most popular traditional MMORPG of all time and is currently in an unrecognizable state to most of the players.
---
The people who dislike Dungeon Finder were never on disastrously low pop servers where running a dungeon was near impossible due to lack of people or appropriate roles to fill out a group.
---
Hello, Nerd here!
---
Originally, everyone was asking for a version from 2006 private servers were based on. The company said no a few times, that they didn't have it etc, and eventually, they said they found a very specific version from 2007, before a critical update that started the worst era of the game, so the community was still on board with that version.
---
The updates later came as a much needed thing to make sure the game didn't get boring, but they said it would go through a vote, no matter how small, and it needed a 75% positive vote for any update to get in. They put lots of work into things just to have it thrown away due to lots of votes. This is why OSRS is good IMO.
---
FIXED muzzio's post from below worked. You find the book in Tanaris and can switch to the other profession. Now i'm not sure if you need to actually re-level from 1-200 again, but I did and the book worked.
---
There is a great Mitchel and Webb skit on the apostles pointing out how racist in fact the parable was
---
I mean paladin MT is actually super easy. Shortly after you start the fight and lose aggro the warrior OT picks it up and all you have to do is stand there. Easy as that.
---
I'm guessing you were probably being a child in world/gen chat and he ignored you earlier.
---
Makes no sense? Bro.. We literally summon mounts out of thin air.
---
Can't remember, it was so long ago lol.
---
Awesome
---
My buddy was running RFC and they had a ninja looter. The Ninja was the tank and they really just wanted to get through the dungeon, he's complaininn about it and I was in org and at lvl 25 so I just tanked for them as a warlock and kicked the tank haha. The tanks face was hilarious as he realized he was replaceable for being a jerk.
---
Know the feeling. Have been able to keep it down to 2 toons on classic. Retail got so bad I would log in and stare at all of my max level guys and be paralyzed not knowing who to play. That’s the reason I quit lol.
---
Have the rest of the party wait a few attacks after you do so that you can build up threat. Can make a big difference on bosses.
---
Need rolls on BoE's soulbinding it is a brilliant idea, although it still leaves the option open for trolls to troll people with it. 
---
All needing on valuable BoE's is the fairest, safest way to go about it, just a fact.
---
Nice, you should report back when you figure it out. I'm sure you won't be the last person to run into this (not vanilla wow behavior from the sound of it) so another data point on whether it works would be great to have :)
---
It's funny, because they didn't "beat" the game. It takes waaaaaaaaay more than one MC run to get your gear out of it.
---
And Vashj'ir is one of my all time favorite zones! That may be pathologically masochistic

Many suggested general macros, what about a roleplaying macros category?
---
We all just going to act like it's completely normal to have a dragon in SW?!?!  KILL IT
---
These came out in BC.
---
I did that the first week, but now I only do 1v1, 2v2 and I wait for people to heal up b4 I fuck them up. 
---
Except gnomes and paladins. They are Loss no matter what
---
Then go playa fighting game if you dislike the leveling. I understand what you want and why it just doesn't fit the game. Your individual characters should not have any baring on one another. No cross character reps / pets / xp bonuses.
---
🔥 omae wa mou shindeiru 🔥
---
I was holding threat initially, it was the aggro wipe from knockback that was the problem.
---
&gt;rage investment
---
You're wasting rage with heroic strike because you've got the cost for the skill *and* your next auto doesn't generate rage. It actually costs 25-40 rage depending on weapon damage and crits. Sunder has a much better dmg per rage
---
Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying you'll be \*bad\*, I'm just saying everyone else who can heal can do it better and is generally more desired. Most things in vanilla were bad by today's standards. Pretty much every healer boils down to spamming your most heal-per-mana-point-efficient rank of flash of light/healing touch/wave/heal. Druids didn't really get their shine until TBC.
---
I hate you
---
Take my upvote
---
Is there an addon or a database to see what items are safe to trash? I am talking about post-quest items like 'The Story of Morgan Ladimore'.  I need bag space, just not sure if some things are needed down the road like books and letters.
---
You were stopped, check out some old vanilla pvp vids on yt!
---
My friends and I who have a five man have a rhythm t our pulls that allows me to keep over 50% mana, unless something bad happens, and allows the tank to keep rage. But that's because we have all worked together so long. It's a bit slower that some might like but there is very little standing around.
---
It’s the reason I don’t mob grind with friends
---
Someone’s buying every rank of every spell when they level
---
I simply don't trust the current team enough to make Classic+ content that's on par with what the original team achieved. Anything in line with current Blizzard philosophy would be lackluster as we see on Retail. I think the safest way to progress is relasing expansions with gated phases up to Wrath, because Cataclysm closed the cycle on what we called the Vanilla world. I'll be down to level to 80 again, Wrath was peak as far as I'm concerned.
---
I’ll have to search this up as well. It’s pretty obvious the whole of Samaritans couldn’t all be bad. It’s certainly a racist prejudice.
---
i can't find any sort of reliable source on this, do you have one?
---
It literally gives you their coordinates...
---
Don’t lie, you were serious. It was received poorly, now you claim sarcasm.
---
Also, gems (better custom itemization).
---
And feral attack power removing the whole "feral weapons damage equals caster weapon dps" thing.
---
And crazy health and armor scaling.
---
Like rogue MT easy
---
Some classes have a rough time vs warriors as soon the Warrior gets Improved Overpower. Dodge at least once every 5 seconds? Catch this instant two-hand crit.
---
Self-masturbatory story time: There was an alliance Druid, level 30, ganking people low on HP at Satyrnaar in Ashenvale. I was there to do a warrior quest at 29, still using Crescent Staff (no luck in BFD or RFK). I saw him one shot some other warrior that had barely survived a pull, and hopped on him. Chased him back to the graveyard, where he turned to fight me.
---
He was overconfident and got crushed.
---
I stayed in the area. He rezzed, stealthed off, and healed up. Tried again.
---
Closer this time, but I won because he tried to reset too many times and ran OOM, and didn’t have first aid.
---
This went on for a while, I think he fought me 4 times at the graveyard, they all were close but Improved Overpower was too much for him.
---
Eventually I went back to the satyrs to finish my quest, saw him ganking more low HP hordies, and chased him off a few times. Couldn’t kill him though, druids are too slippery.
---
I left the area to head back to Splintertree. Right as I’m rounding the corner and the town’s coming into view, he pounces on me AGAIN.
---
This fight was extremely close. He was popping enraged regen, rooting me to reset, my overpowers didn’t crit twice in a row, etc. But I popped a healthpot and just barely won.
---
Narcotic, on Grobbulus, if you read this:
---
Good fights, you damn dirty elf.
---
You sire are a true Hero.
---
Very cool. It bothers me that Splinter isn't a different race though lol.
---
I give mages 50s for water all the time!

If I want I can consume NO mana, or I can consume ALL my mana on one mab. 1 water doesn't fill my bar, If I have mage water, I can blow through 20 in 15 min. All day session? Yeh I could use hundreds. 
---
Mana spent=time saved.
---
Would have gotten done faster with another AOE mage instead of a 2H warrior too.
---
Especially because healing that aggro-pulling (or even worse face-pulling) DPS is likely to pull those mobs to you as the healer.
---
Shatter helps. More crits = less mana used.
---
Fuck the mods
---
What was the compliment lol?
---
I've noticed this too. Huge delay doing anything in this zone only. I spend alot of time there and it's super annoying
---
&gt; You've created some perfect scenario lab test that isn't at all what it's like to actually tank and heal a dungeon.
---
It's not a perfect scenario, it's a decision tree that will lead us to make the same decision in 95% of cases
---
The DPS pulled aggro:
---
* 90% of the time the tank re-establishes aggro before we would be reacting anyway and we aren't mana-constrained. Make sure the tank is safe and then tend to the DPS. I assume we handle this the same way.
---
* 5% of the time, the tank re-establishes aggro and/or resources are tight. Preserve/regen mana only for the tank. The DPS may or may not die, but if only one player is dying this fight, it won't be the tank. I assume we handle this the same way.
---
* 5% of the time, the tank does not re-establish aggro. I do not heal the DPS class unless there are some extenuating circumstances because in my experience it is the safest decision for the group as a whole. This is where we differ.
---
Yeah people don't realize how long it takes to conjure a stack of water after training and how shitty the water is when you can conjure a stack at a time.
---
Just wanted to quickly shoot you some positiveness, thanks for all your help over these years!
---
But it's only people who apply. I dont see how its functionally different from people whispering you after you spam lfg. Keep in mind that in a single server scenario you are going to get way less application than you do on retail.
---
Okay I get your frustration with AoE classes. I really do. Nothing can hold threat against a mage just spamming AE over and over. But if they don't frost nova or ice block then it goes to my point of everyone has CC or a way to break threat. If they don't use it and die then I am sorry you grouped with a non-team player. My point is I almost never see it, but everyone's experience is different. Maybe I'm lucky.
---
Alliance dog! He got what he deserves
---
I haven’t tried that but I would think you would want to prioritize shooting the wand

i'd imagine asmondgold has a subreddit dedicated to him. people would probably care a bit more there. judging by the 6% upvoted nobody here gives a damn.

I ordered mine in oct 18, not got it yet
---
OP reeks of Hunter
---
Mages stay on top pretty much all of vanilla.  People are always going to want good aoe damage, good single target damage, buffs, water, and poly.
---
The gear competition is gonna be real though.

Same I only speak for the Bear Tanks. Don’t get me wrong Cat Druids can do some damage but two equally skilled players Kitty will lose against rogue in dps.

I only give 1 stack at most to people that want water for free, when they are going to tip I give more (depending on the level I am, because no way I’m conjuring for someone more than 1 stack when I make 2-6 at a time

But you have to do mcp ontop of the other consumables

Ashbringer on EU. Market is definitely wonky still, I'm comparing mine to a friends and it's basically opposite prices on both.

Quite. That was the scary part when trying to get away from a rogue. It would stop you and you would need to release and rehit the run command to keep going to get out of range of sap or whatever

Read the thread.  Nothing made up about it.

You based your entire assessment of healers based on a handful of *Stockade* runs, dude.

i wrote up a super big post with math and i decided it wasn't worth it to bother people with all the details. basically, i agree with what you're saying, but in general, the moonkin using it on themselves wouldn't really be disastrous in a normal situation. this was the tl:dr though:

a healer innervate isn't numerically stronger than a moonkin innervate, or at least not obviously so from a healer mana standpoint. a mage or warlock innervate is probably better than a moonkin innervate for the raid, but we'd be talking about an extra second or so being shaved off a fight, and that just doesn't matter that much. as long as you can expect the healers to not go oom, you can expect to use innervate on yourself as a moonkin or another dps, your call. but, sometimes a healer innervate means a saved raid, so don't unilaterally save it for yourself--always consider what the best option is in the current scenario.
---
i also compared innervate to brez as an analogy, which i think is worthwhile to bring up: you shouldn't expect to use brez in a fight, because you shouldn't expect people to die from mistakes. but we still have it and use it regularly, of course. innervate is the same way, you shouldn't expect to use it on a healer, because you shouldn't expect the healer to make mistakes. but if the situation arises where they need it more than the raid needs the extra dps, then absolutely do so.
---
Da-BUUUUU.
---
I made a two handed sword (+6 stamina, level 14 req.) it IT LOOKS AMAZING.  I want somekinda glow on it...maybe beastslaying.
---
Wasnt it always like this? I switched to english client a while ago and remember it being 40 meters in retail back when I played german client to now saying 40 yards in english client. Presumably the same range, but wrongly writtten out in the tooltip
---
I'm his friend.
---
Yes. On the other hand, no. But maybe yes.
---
A small part of what I said was a jab. The other part was a literal fact. Each person will interact with a different crowd than the next. You discredited those that had positive experiences and said "STFU" as if they were making it up. You're making generalized statements yet claiming i'm karma whoring. There's a ton of irony there.
---
Lok'tar ogar mother fucker
---
I've started building a healing set at 30 in case I get a dungeon group that doesn't need a tank, but you could wait until 40 or later maybe. Hold onto green drops with int. If a quest reward doesn't have feral gear, it will usually have some int gear so take that. Talk with group mates about needing healing gear if the healer doesn't need or can't equip int drops (hint try to avoid pally healers on your group so you automatic get any healing leather pieces)
---
Funny, I have the exact same experience with horde players. Never a fair 1v1 or 2v2 with equal level players, it's either 4v1 or gangs of reds or ?? ganking you and doing the usual taunting. That is litreally why i just turned of the game. 4 reds and a ?? killing and camping me while trying to do a quest, imposible to HS home because I were surrounded. Blood and Honor indeed.
---
Warrior to hunter will be one of the biggest differences in questing efficiency in the game. If it’s any consolation, warrior past 40 gets better. It’s basically all white hits until then. Sweeping strikes does make it a little better at 30 to be able to kill 2 mobs at once
---
Well I can’t work it out, and I’m not sure if anyone else can either
---
It's "great" when you are friends with the heals though.  We have a standing agreement that if you pull it by your own idiocy after already being warned you get to tank it with no heals.  Why risk the healer pulling aggro?
---
Also, hope you want to run in, she's a druid and we're not wasting a cooldown rez that could be used on someone who cares in battle later.
---
I can guarantee you that the people with the mindset of roll need on anything of value are certainly going to avoid grouping unless they absolutely have to. You can always lose a need roll but you can't lose out if there's nobody to roll against.
---
yeah early lvl warrior tanks really do need a good amount of time to ramp up, but they become beasts when they have excess rage. pulling aggro early hurts warriors so bad.
---
Okay, I will have to look into it.
---
H
---
I’m lost, if you block channel invites what part do you still see?
---
I love classic...
---
Ah right, wouldn't know dont use it.
---
Just to verify, Classic doesn’t have /focus, correct? Would make life a lot easier as dps. 
---
I played only a priest healer from Vanilla-Panda.  Rolled a Hunter &amp; Mage in Classic. It’s really hard trying to target the tank’s target when they switch targets mid fight. If I had /focus (?/setfocus), I can @mouseover the unit frame /focustarget. 
---
How do you deal with tanks constantly switching targets mid fight?
---
whats the best leveling rotation for cat druid at level 38?
---
can you ever miss out on quests? or can you still do them at a higher level for BoP gear?
---
could it be that they entered in your info correctly which activated the authenticator, but even just getting to that point caused you to get logged out but at the same time it didnt get recorded as a log in? basically meaning you were saved by the authenticator.
---
Yeah early morning is for solo, afternoon is for groups.
---
If I ever need some hot tips for how to play stockades, sure.
---
reminds me of the all priest Onyxia run.
---
If you're using subreddit style, on the right should be a "Show my flair on this subreddit" text, and "edit" next to it.
---
Slow but inevitable death. :)
---
Those people have retail though, they shouldn't sully our Classic when they have a game dedicated to new released content.
---
Nah, that would've been too harsh. The graveyard isn't very far.
---
Wash your back!
---
Good good.  Why risk the healer pulling aggro and dying too?  Better to let them die and not risk the party.
---
Those disses you get from the „wrong“ trainers are rly funny sometimes!
---
Reddit mods in general have lost their minds.  Subs are nothing but arbitrary unnecessary rules and political/business censorship. It’s ruining Reddit.  I think most Reddit mods where little plastic sheriffs badges and hats while they police their subs.
---
Meanwhile, I ran SM twice and got Ravager... both times.
---
The creator must've been laughing his ass off while creating this, hahah brilliant!
---
I had to quit just as my guild was getting deep into ulduar hard mode raids and was absolutely loving it. I just wanna get a crack at tanking that again dammit
---
"a joke exploiting the different possible meanings of a word or the fact that there are words which sound alike but have different meaning"
---
0 being part of the before mentioned binary code, but also in this context a pun as it refers to the poster above getting 0 (zero) loot while the rest of us get some.
---
LBRS?
---
Ok but what if I REALLY don't want to be the guy who's 40 and doesn't have a mount.
---
I am using consecrate and if I am able to get a full duration of my highest rank of it off before dps starts, my reflection damage and lower rank consecrates is enough for me to hold threat 99% of the time. So far the only time I really have had an issue is when I brought a long a shadow priest and they just went all out with mind blasts.
---
Hahahaha
---
Gotta get that classic feel you know
---
Dungeons are very fun to me, because you meet people and make friends along the way. 
---
If you're more of a solo type player, the addon "questie" might help you find appropriate quests for your level!
---
I believe the pre-raid BiS Warrior tanking weapon is a dagger off The Beast in UBRS. Finkle’s Skinner?
---
Short term fluctuations are impossible to predict, but long term the price will drop naturally.
---
I agree to some extent, adding too much qol makes the game worse, yet the summoning stones are just a little time saver for a hugely time consuming game. And people are spamming dungeons to level up now thus the summoning stone wouldnt change anything..
---
Look how incredible this fishing video there in Brazil!
---
[https://youtu.be/LhG91sc6w0I](https://youtu.be/LhG91sc6w0I)
---
What’s this spot called? Level 20 rogue asking that wants to buy a mount someday.
---
Whenever a paladin using Blessing of Protection the mobs stop attacking you immediately and latch on to the next closest person.
---
yeah, since the mcp effect will last 1m30s before needing to change to another one, causing the 30s cd, and fights tend to last only 2 minutes or so in phase 1 at least, you should expect to bring one per pull on a boss. so a fully-loaded cat or bear druid would have 15-20 of them for an MC clear, so they have plenty extra just in case.
---
Rogues are an after thought to warriors. (for horde at least)
---
Lol these comments are so retarded
---
I'm an ass for being insulted by an incredibly insulting "tip"?
---
I stopped everything I was doing, flew across the zone, and made a bunch of water -- and the guy offered me the WoW equivalent of 1 cent.
---
why would he come to a full stop like that?
---
Because it's a good game.
---
I won't but i'm way behind the scales still at lvl 23
---
sILLY LOVE  SONGS
---
Newsflash, nobody who plays classic cares about people who stream classic
---
I'd actually recommend agi over str, even as a bear.  Crit, armor, and dodge are going to serve you better as a tank than ap.  Especially since armor and dodge are your only forms of mitigation as a druid.
---
gj .. holds a few levels before you need to replace it rofl.
---
ya, CharacterStatsClassic
---
Alrighty go and grind gorillas and tigers for 6 hours for one level then.
---
If the DPS I run with told me that they secretly coordinated to each attach a different target on pull before I've had a chance to get one maul in I would believe them.
---
My brother and I are levelling together, he's a pally healer and I'm a warrior tank. We are both around level 30. Questing is easy as we can always pull the big groups that most people avoid and getting into dungeons is instant and we get our pick of the dps. Needless to say we never pick mail wearers :)
---
Do raids above LFR and normal count? Heroic and Mythic? Mage tower challenges? Yes, I don't do Mythic+ because if I wanted to do Diablo rifts, I'd go play Diablo. PM me your armory, I'd love to see your achievements.
---
This is mainly because English speakers used mainly French/Latin words when trying to sound fancy.
---
I can't think of my server name lol. The guild is syndicate. Maybe he/other people use the line frequently?
---
You really shouldn't level as prot. It's not even good for tanking. Arms is way better. For lowlvl like pre 30 you should use rend. After that you don't.
---
When you take a flight path you literally go over people's heads.
---
Which one would you say has a higher skill cap?
---
Relax and flow. The vast majority of your exp comes from killing monsters. It's okay for some quests to take longer.
---
pservers were streaming as well and the population was 11-12K live viewers, nothing was ever done to fight them, except for random raids from guilds from opposite faction, it was a total monopoly. It's dead with layering now tho
---
Hillsbrad is just as bad IMO.
---
That's some impressive numerology you just pulled out of your ass. 
---
A vanilla server cap was 3k people. The absolute MOST on a nuclassic server is 15k and that isn't being anywhere close to hit as they're throttle it down with queues.
---
r/whoooosh
---
This bro never skips legs day
---
&gt;Keep in mind we will be getting a bunch of new talent in classic
---
um...no no we are not we are getting the old talents back.
---
Im just doing it because I gave up questing as a warrior. Playing my mage and having such an easy time dosent make me feel any better either
---
I got a 30m duration disease that lowered my int from a swoop in Arathi. Pretty annoying as a mage.
---
Just make sure to get instant corruption, del concentration and dark pact.  After that, season to taste.
---
Here's the thing.
---
Not all dps are bad. Most are fine. Being a good dps doesn't really get you noticed because it is easy and not very obvious. But every group has 3 dps. And only one has to be terrible to ruin everything.
---
so, do we have an official answer yet?
---
*cries in druid*
---
Shroud said himself he sees himself playing WoW Classic for another year or two. Whether or not he streams is up to how often he gets stream sniped / ganked.
---
I love the uberstupid rule of posts having to have flair or they will be automatically removed.
---
Says you....
---
Genociding bad people so he good in my book
---
So I trade one message for another?  That doesn’t sound any better.
---
it's also taking away from the point that there's a lot of inconsistencies in this game, but hey lets meme it up
---
Isn't the spirit of classic fun gameplay and distinct classes over who gets the highest dps?
---
Printing at home will probably be doable, but painting it is a bitch
---
If it were against TOS, they would come out and plainly state it was against TOS. They did not, therefore it is not.
---
WoW should have always had a conflict between two factions but never forced. They should've allowed you to befriend someone from the opposing faction to group up with, trade and learn their language to be able to communicate. They could've introduced a rep system that would determine person's status towards one-another as either an enemy, neutral, or friendly player. The more friendly you become with others, the more likely you will be seen as neutral towards everyone you meet instead of flagged for PvP instantly.
---
disgusting
---
If they create a classic+ it will either be two separate subscriptions or they will charge people for the base Classic+ game and place it on the current subscription model.  
---
Creating Vanilla using existing notes and algorithms isn't that hard or costly compared to creating new content from scratch.  There is no way they invest in designing an entire expansion (or just large patch, whatever) that will change the game completely, require new teams of people to develop and test, and then just make it part of the current subscription model.  Especially if they are still also paying people to update and progress retail.
---
Seriously though. I played horde back in the day and took them for granted, never realized how good I had it until I picked alliance this time. 
---
There's not even an alliance flight path in STV other than booty bay!
---
That would be awesome, super overwhelming looking at all these addons first time loading into it!
---
I got this set the week of launch. Shit looks great.
---
Haha, he healed my SM Cath run yesterday, good bloke.
---
Nice idea
---
Nah he's right. So far my experience has been great, I haven't found anyone I genuinely dislike yet through my dungeoneering etc
---
Um no dude I didnt miss your obvious joke I just didnt comment on it...
---
It's possible to make an observation related to the joke while also still getting your blatantly obvious joke.
---
Old Blanchey has a good pop but no queues since the first two days that I've run in to.
---
Sally's got Gams for dayyyssss
---
The formula is:
---
 XP = (Base XP) \* (1 + 0.05 \* (Mob Level - Char Level) ) 
---
Base XP = (Char Level \* 5) + 45 
---
From  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob\_XP](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP) 
---
So yes you do get extra exp from high lvl mobs, and you can use mobtagging to get a lot of exp. Althought I must insist that dungeons are far superior for mobtagging, you just need a 3 man party and then leave party to tag the mobs and get them killed within 60 seconds and then accept invite back, rinse repeat.
---
You won't be "the guy". You need to understand most people don't have their most at 40 unless they plan accordingly. I lended my friend 65g so he could buy his at 40, because i play paladin and get a free mount.
---
It helps that there are leftover portals all over the damn place because the original team had more ideas than time.
---
Some of these are written by absolute retards.
---
Spriests being meh in pvp? Are they serious? Warlocks A-tier? What? 
---
Warriors are great in pvp if they're being fucking babied otherwise they're near useless to anyone that has any sort of movement speed improvement.
---
Congrats you have improved Hamstring as a warrior, just as much as hunters have improved wing clip, deterrence and counter attack, and surefooted. In a 1v1 you can charge, get scatter shorted and trapped, and he bobbles away. And guess what, your pvp trinket doesn't get out of freezing trap. It's a bullshit match-up that's nearly as bad as frost mage.
---
Warlocks are regularly banned from "dueling tournaments" (lmao) because they're almost unkillable as soul link.
---
I felt great joy denying every single Gnomer quest I saw when I started hitting that level. Damn do I hate that dungeon
---
Personally if it's Word-PVP + PvE content, then you want to go for Damage + Armour then health. You could put some points into frost or shadow resistance, because this helps the pet resist fear or being frozen.
---
Maladath should go to human fury on alliance or non-human rogues. For horde it should just go to rogues, Horde Warriors can get 304 weapon skill with Maladath which arguably isn't worth it compared to fury daggers or they can get to 311 with Maladath and Edge Master's which is overkill.
---
So the reason people use Fury for level 60 but not leveling is because dual wielding in classic comes with a -19% chance to hit penalty to your auto attacks when dual wielding in addition to any dodge/parry/miss chance you have against the mob to begin with.  While this 19% doesn't affect special attacks like Overpower/Heroic strike/etc... a lot of your damage comes from white attacks (auto attacks).    
---
At higher levels you can combat some of your miss chance with +hit gear, and with more attack power and crit, having more attacks eventually becomes more powerful than fewer stronger attacks from a two hander.  While you're leveling though you generally just have access to STR/Stam with the occasional boost to hit/crit/AP.    
---
I think the math works out to 2 hander attacks have 85% chance to hit after all the dodge/miss/parry stuff, and dual wielding has 66% chance to hit.  That is why it's better to go back to it once you've gotten all the necessary +hit/+damage talents and gear to help boost it up.
---
I think the other big difference is that people from every timezone would play on the same private server. This meant the population would remain fairly stable 24 hours a day. This isn't true on Classic servers.
---
I think everyone who's played WoW hardcore and everyone who knows someone that does, sees the funny side :D
---
I also like to deposit gold into my bank to make exact drug/sex numbers to get reddit karma.
---
See you then!
---
The reason druids arent really used in raids isnt due to threat gen or anything like that, its because raid bosses can do whats called a crushing blow.  Paladins and warriors can raise their armor high enough to make it where crushing blows never happen (paladins arent used as raid tanks due to a lack of a taunt ability) while druids cant, so they are very spikey in taking damage.  
---
The video is when they are pretty much outgearing Ony, its not that druids cant raid tank its just much harder to keep them alive.
---
I don't have any problems with BWL after 8 months, we just need phase 2 before then for sure, not 4 months after, probably closer to 3.
---
It will add world bosses (great), but most importantly, the rewards for pvping.
---
I don't care about after phase 6, it's &gt;2 years away, right now I am looking at the next step - phase 2.
---
I bet we aren't getting the full story. I bet it was like 2-3 mobs and OP just wants to get a self-esteem boost on Reddit by warping the story to make us feel bad for him.
---
Whats a level 34 doing in Tanaris?
---
Shockadins used to be a thing. But maybe that was only popular or even viable in tbc i don't know.
---
Stand at the bank tellers in UC. Run up on either ramp and to the right is either an Inn keeper or a flight master. If you found the wrong one you just turn around and head to the bank tellers then go up the opposite ramp and to the right.
---
That is how I have always done it anyway lol.
---
I learned there are quests in Dun Morogh that become un-doable if you accept them in the wrong order. Basically you could finish part 2 of a quest chain without doing part 1, and then part 1 becomes forever unavailable.
---
For the sake of completion, is there a published list of stuff like this?
---
Try checking their market caps and get back to me idiot
---
Good advice for the shouts I did not know that. And yeah cleave is in my rotation
---
And to great effect, at least in PvP.
---
Relog
---
You're the worst guy to have in a group.
---
No private server timelines. Blizzard would be dumb to accelerate the timeline. That's a good way to get burnout and cause a subscription cancellation. As it is, I'm dreading the time when the guild wants MC, ONY, BWL, and ZG. When ZG rolls around, I'm not sure I can keep up that kind of raiding schedule today vs. 2004. Nice and slow keeps the $15 flowing in. I couldn't care less if the streamers get bored and leave.
---
thank you both for avoiding the question and offering an alternative that completely negates the initial request, it was really helpful.
---
I had to double check they weren't elite or something on my hunter because they took so damn long to kill!
---
Yeah everyone always talks about fears of servers dying, but man my most fun in the game has always been on lower pop servers, the only real issue is if it’s lower pop and heavily unbalanced between factions.
---
Don't think there is much to this question. There is an abundance of people playing DPS classes vs people playing healers/tanks so the market is a bit saturated when LFG. as a DPS you kind of just have to deal with whatever healer/tank you get, otherwise you probably just don't get to run that dungeon unless your guildies are on and at the same level.
---
I’ve never died on those. I’m not sure how they got the reputation they did. Maybe I’m a master of reflexes and not running into walls.
---
What is that skill you're using?
---
Agility stamina and intellect are your big 3 stats. Agility &gt; all and stamina and intellect you want a bit of both but not at the expense of agility. Raw attack power is rare to find on items but is very good too.
---
Wolf is fine for a pet. Actually every pet is good. There are none that will suck so bad it hurts you. Choosing your favorite is not bad at all. If you want to min/max your damage or pvp then you want to look at optimal pets.
---
I love nerding about hunters so if you have more questions fire away

Weird in what way?

What does engineering get you??
---
Is this another one of those "I am not guilty of this, but because I am the same class of those who are, I'm offended!" posts that are all the rage on the interwebs these days?
---
In beta, you could run the macro 
---
    /run SetCVar(“nameplateMaxDistance”, 60)
---
Which set the range to 60 yards, then Blizzard fixed it so you couldn't change it. But people realized you could get around their fix by using scientific numbers, like
---
    /run SetCVar(“nameplateMaxDistance”, 6e1)
---
And this worked from day 1 until yesterday.
---
i did a few runs of SM cath with a shaman tank. went great actually.
---
Back in highschool when I was playing TBC, I found another person playing at my highschool and I asked him details. We were both on Argent Dawn, Horde, a Hunter and low 20s. He was an orc and I was blood elf was the only difference. No prior contact!
---
I don't know what that even means.  I'm the reason?  Are you just bashing a downvoted comment for easy karma?
---
You honestly raided as a mage and wanted each person to whisper you for water?  I don't believe you.
---
There used to be a 1h sword made by blacksmiths that looks like and icicle sword. Around lv40 to equip it. I forget what stats it had or what it was even called but I plan on dual qeilsing two of those as soon as I get high enough level for it
---
Stop giving this douchenozzle exposure on reddit.  She doesn't even go here.
---
Meh, clicking decline is easier
---
So instead you just proceeded to completely miss the joke and went off on your own tangent?    Yeah ok dude :P
---
Feet.
---
Cataclysm caused it to flood.
---
It's subjective for sure, which is better than the other, but let's be real, the earlier expansions had far better systems, than modern WoW.
---
More focus on the adventure, less about "zerg to max and zerg gear". More focus on player and class identity, not just "X class has 1.5% more theoretical dps, stack that." Less loot lottery more treasuring what you get.
---
There's an lfg channel?!
---
Alliance can use it too, since you can get onto it from the main north/south stonetalon road. All it took for me to find it was aggroing the sunrock guards once and dying to them
---
Was on here I’m 99% sure I’ll try to find it
---
Hi Shannon remember me?
---
I’m genuinely happy for both of you, but Classic is packed with assholes. They are just forced to work together. That’s the win. Happy gaming lads.
---
I feel that. Still having more fun than when playing retail.
---
Pussydick
---
Don't move the goalposts. This post isn't about pvp.
---
or just kite as frost mage.
---
Community is the most important thing in my opinion. Although my server is fairly full I have met the same people in different locations and it does feel really cool to do so. I was waiting on some mobs to spawn and was working with a priest that was almost done and I decided to try another time, I did a dungeon with him the next day just randomly happened to join the group, so we chatted about that and he did get his quest done. Really cool I think.
---
&gt;but you’ll be far more effective at dungeons as Prot. 
---
&gt;I disagree with this assessment for the most part, as this is only true for dungeons lvl 50 and higher
---
You're saying that tanking as arms is more efficient until level 50, and OP is level 50.
---
The Blood Elves you play in WC3 sided with Illidan, not the Horde. In fact, none of the Horde races - with the exception of the Forsaken - are even in The Frozen Throne expansion, unless if you could Rexxar's story.
---
Mortal strike tho?
---
Time is money, friend.
---
&gt;Defense is wasted since you can't realistically hit the cap. Defense capping removes a variable of mob critical hits. Not capping means you can still be crit. Druids will take crits, it's a fact of life and it's one of many reasons people prefer warrior tanks
---
Don't forget about crushing blows as well, which can also crit, where if that happens in rapid succession you have a dead druid tank, its not that they couldn't raid tank, it was just much harder to keep bear tanks alive than warriors.
---
I’ve heard that pickpocketing BRD is not nearly as efficient for gold farming  as a Rogue as it used to be. Are there any other Rogue specific gold farms that are available at 60?
---
As a tank: 
---
If I’m in a competent group with good damage I’d like to pull at least 3 packs at a time. I can’t actually do this well without walking my slow ass  over so please pull extra packs. 
---
And usually anyone good can tell when we’re underpulling and drag a pack onto me.
---
&gt;is there possibly an addon to help with feeding your pet in classic?
---
the question was " **is there possibly an addon to help with feeding your pet in classic?** " not that my adhd prevents me from staying aware of certain abstract elements. Most likely going to assume, that none of you play hunters, its a full time chore. There were addons previous in the multitide that did this function was just asking if there was one availbable for classic.
---
Crescent staff boi. Druids also love the dungeon set
---
On my server its very very easy to get enough leather to make a set in a couple hours farming if you know spawn locations and timers.
---
The market is also flooded with leather to the point it will soon hit 5g/ea. 
---
The reason devilsaur mafias work on private servers is the low population of people makes it hard to shut down a coordinated group. There are 10x or more people on populated classic servers right now so you would need a huge raid sized group to lock down the crater. Also layering.
---
Oh, come on...that's not my point at all mate
---
Reason I rolled ele at 40. Even stormstrike didnt save me from this horrible feeling
---
+1 for having sriracha within grab distance of computer, my man
---
Can confirm this is lag. I used to raid on dial up back in the day and it was common for a raid member to ask if I'm hacking because my corpse would swim in the lava for ages.
---
Real men measure in washing machines
---
It definitely feels bad, thanks no changes crowd.
---
Two handed axes in Orgrimmar?
---
This makro is very nice. Can u pls explain to me how it actualy works. I want to make some other makros like this.
---
Funny cause people hate that idea in retail
---
So far every leveling guide I've read recommends against using WF because of its tendency to overkill mobs (overkill=wasted time)
---
That will only keep the warrior alive. Wont stop the Paladin.
---
Holy shit man, congrats!! Guess you were farming for eye of shadows the other day when we talked?

I'm from the southern US, can you convert this to bullet velocity of an AK-47 per Walmart parking lot?
---
maybe you're spending too much time in /r/politics then
---
I actually like this way better than cookie cutter “mage stats,” paladin stats” etc. It means you have to make decisions rather than have a clear upgrade path.
---
200 words is an essay? Did you mean 2000? 200 words sounds like an abstract for a real essay.
---
sorry, I cant remember the name of the int/stam/spirit neck piece I got from SM, but that is what I mean. I had 2 drop for me, and sold the other probably too low cause it sold pretty quick at 3g
---
Can’t you see their HP bar on the top of your screen?
---
Autism
---
and you have to do that much farming for pretty much every pull you're going to do that night...every raid night...for the duration of classic.  Yuck...at the point where you're considering this your first instinct should be to jump ship and play a rogue.
---
Bloodsail has had quite a lot of really solid rp encounters for me.
---
I don’t have anything other than anecdotal experience, but it’s not really the old WoW players that are smug. It’s typically the people that played a lot of private servers and expect everyone else to know what’s going on already. Those of us that played vanilla and quit when retail lost our attention are usually happy to help others.
---
Two priests got me lol
---
Good thing wars aren’t fought 1v1
---
I always hear these, and don't get me wrong I'm not a feral hater in particular, I almost rolled one. But nobody can ever back up these claims with logs. And the last logs I did see had furies and rogues doubling the feral in naxx. Just no point to it.
---
thanks, ill look into it
---
That part is really only pointed at the Glacier slow tanks. Hypothetically speaking, if I pull one or two mobs straight to the tank, am I assisting him in pulling, or am I griefing?
---
Not exactly coordinated but I named my guild Ka Tet, after lore in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. My character's name is RolandNine (didn't reserve Roland but that name still works if you know). Got a random in game mail from Flagg. Thought that was cool. If I find any character names with Dark Tower references, gotta get them in the guild.
---
I really disagree with that opinion. Classic is not a casual game in the least, in fact I would say the people who want to "chill" are still playing retail as many of my old WoW buddies are. Shit, I even hop onto retail and level alts when I'm burnt out on Classic grind for the day because it's that much "chiller," as you say. No fighting over bosses, no fighting over mob spawns, no fighting over gear, no having to go out of your way to find a group, etc. Classic is catered towards hardcore players. When those players are gone there is going to be little to no players remaining who are willing to go through the immense grind it takes to get to sixty. We don't live in 2004 anymore, people don't play Classic for the same reasons they used to. You seem to have a very idealized view of the playerbase and honestly, I hope you're right, but I really, really doubt it. I know even seasoned vets of WoW (who played through vanilla in 2004) who have burned out grinding to 60 in 2019 Classic and quit the game.
---
Marketing to the most hardcore players is how you keep the game alive. Those are the people who keep playing day after day for years upon years. And you know how you keep them involved? By adding new content periodically. These people are going to leave Classic once they burn through the content and the majority of those who remain will never reach 60, will never go above and beyond to organize raid groups, etc. It's just not a casual game. You don't play classic casually and get anywhere.
---
I hope this is only a small group of elitists doing this shit. The only time I get picky with my group is if we have 2 melee dps and need a ranged. Could not care less if we have a druid tank, pally heals, or a feral dps. If we get the dungeon done without too many wipes I'm a happy camper.
---
sounds cool, ill give it a shot
---
Oh I see in dealing with a child who genuinely needs validation. Sorry for not acknowledging your excellent observational comedy. Do you do stand up?
---
It was a joke you special person.
---
I still play retail but no worries..
---
Just finish your part up and say thanks for the assist. They'll understand. You could even tell them why. No need to feel guilty.
---
i dont think your rogueing right
---
ok thank you
---
In wraith were you on raven crest by chance
---
I have these on my troll too, such a weird stat imo. Not sure how helpful these actually are. They are blue but my green 3 stam/6int are probably better.
---
Devilsaur is only valuable to the extreme min-maxers, the majority of the population simply won't care enough and thus just wait for (other) loot to drop.
---
+ People who don't care about min-maxing won't go out of their way to buy it
---
+ Once people stop buying it the 'sellers' cannot afford to sell it
---
+ 'Sellers' become desperate to ship their now edging to worthless goods (and thus lower price).
---
These mods are garbage lol, glad the game is finally out and I can just play
---
It was bugged and fixed, the threat generation was not correct.
---
Its ridiculous to me that it is simultaneously against the rules and not enforced by the client. String validation isn't hard folks. The only real issue I see is localization problems, which might have been the internal argument.
---
I do sit down too
---
Was literally just reading on the Classic Druid discord guides, found this in depth [Druids are valid raid OT guide](https://classicwow.live/guides/22/treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla).
---
Druids used to only have 125% armor bonus in 1.0... in Dire bear O.o!
---
Social anxiety of just saying nah, i found something else instead. Some people are like that man :/
---
Your wardrobe suggests otherwise.
---
weird as in actually playing a druid. What a mad lad /s
---
Well met.
---
What!? Are you just making that up
---
15€/month, 4 months, 60€. If classic stays this way and fun for that much time it will have been a total success for me.
---
And that's a few extra hours a week that could have been farming, helping guild, or enjoying oneself instead of waiting 30 minutes per rotation of 5 gnomers.
---
I use a program called Lightshot so when I press Print Screen I can immediately mark what I want and copy paste it into a post, for me it would very much be more of a hassle with a phone.
---
I'll be going full feral. It's not bad if you're not bad.
---
Fair enough. Makes sense
---
&lt;Nine Inch Males&gt;
---
We did it!
---
What I do when Im either healing or tanking is say this in party chat.
---
"I'm old fashioned. If the tank dies, it's the healer's fault. If the healer dies, it's the tank's fault. And if the DPS dies, it's their fault".
---
This almost always gets backed up by the other of healer or tank :)
---
Train your DPS, and everyone lives longer.
---
Check out r/Grobbulus if you haven’t yet. There’s some pics from the RP event yesterday.
---
As with anything, there's a balance. I don't want too many gimmicks, and I think they took them too far and tried to get TOO crazy. I don't need a driveable tank or to surf on a massive spear. But instead of just killing 8 ghouls, maybe it'd be cool to tame eight of them and then use them to kill an elite, or something. Just any variation on "go here, kill x" really.
---
Wall jumping is fixed unfortunately :(
---
Thank you. Saving this later for poop time.
---
I enjoyed my stay.
---
And when that priest "needs" a 2 handed sword, you *remember their name* and make future decisions accordingly.
---
Filthy furries.
---
Yeah I feel for the hunters lol. And the warlocks that people say pull threat, but it’s really just life tap. Gotta love it.
---
I meant like how busy is it? I know it’s a good game
---
Food and Cocaine usually don't mix
---
Incredible. Get this man an award right now.
---
Isn't that just a random elite NPC in classic?
---
I vaguely remember it starting out that way and then being reduced to only needing 1.
---
Get those Bandit shoulders bro. Complete the set you must.
---
Ah, OK, that is better.
---
I'm away from keyboard right now, but does anyone know if the below method for removing the protruding forsaken bones works in Classic? The below steps activate the Chinese censored models.
---
1. Navigate to World of Warcraft/_gameversion_/WTF/
---
2. Open Config.wtf in a text editor.
---
3. Add SET overrideArchive "1" in a new line
---
Also if anyone has any experience playing with this setting, any thoughts? Does it change too much and harm the aesthetic?
---
i love threads like this.
---
people tend to always blame dps and usually is the cause for shit groups.
---
but the amount of shit tier tanks and just how truly god awful they are is far worse than dps pulling packs.
---
"stance dancing" with no tact mastery, wasting rage on worthless skills, not having fucking revenge trained, not using demo shout off the pull, the list goes on.
---
the absolute worst are tanks who don't hesitate to dump their rage bar to 0 during every pull.
---
I tried this but not enough mana at low levels( plus im a mage main so i suck rn)
---
Sure, but a blanket statement that we should all Need only works if everyone is in on it. I hope everyone planning on doing this talks to their team first.
---
Based on what I’ve seen, people think spamming trade chat is the best way.   It’s not.  You can only do it In cities, and When you combine traders and group seekers, the text gets moved off the window too fast.
---
Better off in “/looking for group”
---
You guys are cool and all but what about this waffles and coke guy?
---
You were asking me to imagine me wanting to do it. And I said I can't.
---
On Nostalrius, somebody I was playing TBC with was watching their little brother play and he went past me in the Wetlands and that friend hit me up again on FB. Was a fun coincidence.
---
Have you run the census addon to scan to see what the leveling curve is like? Most people might not even be high enough yet.

---
This isn’t a whoosh situation
---
Where did you learn this? Dun Morogh is so basic with quests that there's hardly any chain going on. I've done it three times now and it always led me to the same next quest until it sent me to Loch Modan.
---
I don’t even really remember know exactly, it was like mostly teenage drama. I just remember him being strange and possessive in a way. I met my “wow boyfriend” through him.
---
He’s probably changed since it’s been like 15 years, but I have too but I’d rather not run into anyone from before my raiding guild days and dredge up that whole bag full of cringe again. 
---
If I see that certain “wow boyfriend” though on my server, I’m moving servers lmao
---
Oh sweet thats the server I made a few characters on! Thanks, seem I picked right.
---
This guy knows
---
sort of.  they had people in there who were in fact not running on a private server for over 5 years.  for example the frost mage doing the most damage pretty much all the time is a high end mythic raider.  There's no special skillset for MC bosses that you need to tone with years of practice, it's just tank n spank with some debuff removal and some light add aoe on a couple fights.
---
Haha it was just a silly joke, didn't mean to come across as rude
---
Says you!
---
Can you get Edwin Vancleef’s armor set in game? I want to have it for RP value
---
&gt; Incredible. Get this ~~man~~ **carrrot** an award right now.
---
Since we are playing the age guessing game, I am gonna further guess like...18 months?
---
oh, fair enough :)
---
That will be a bit harder especially for the good pieces like shoulder and chest. The boots, gloves boe's and helm shoudn't be that hard.
---
This happened to my friend and he told the other player "Oh, sorry. Trade it back and I have some better stuff" and the guy actually traded it back and my friend said "beggars can't be choosers" and hearthed.
---
You’ll go to a weapon trainer to learn how to use new weapons, and the ones you can learn are based on your class. There are two weapon trainers in Orgrimmar in the Valley of Honor named Sayoc and Hanashi, one in Undercity in the War Quarter named Archibald, and one in Thunder Bluff by the bank named Ansekhwa. 
---
Sayoc can train you in: 
---
Daggers
---
Bows
---
One-handed Axes
---
Two-handed Axes
---
Staves
---
Fist Weapons
---
Thrown Weapons
---
Hanashi can train you in:
---
Archibald can train you in:
---
One-handed Swords
---
Two-handed Swords
---
Crossbows
---
Polearms
---
Ansekhwa can train you in:
---
One-handed Maces
---
Two-handed Maces
---
Guns
---
So you’ll need to go to Undercity and pay good ol Archie 10 silver to learn to use 2H swords. Safe travels!
---
The hero we don’t deserve
---
You guys should just drop it. I don't understand what either of you are getting out of this. Much less what would be accomplished over talking about it in discord. With all the effort you've spent retorting to each other you could have used that to grind a level or two, or probably some gold.   
---
I will add that although /u/Luckboy28  omitting some context, he omitted nothing important. /u/raxzergling you sound like a dps who calls everyone retarded after a wipe and leaves the group, or blames the healer/tank/anyone else even though it was you who pulled the pat mobs. At least thats the impression I get from this bickering.  
---
My opinion - healers are essential for any dungeon beyond level 20 where you don't drastically out level the mobs or don't want to have tons of downtime between each pull.
---
At today's economy I'd say you got shafted.  You paid probably 1/3 of peak vanilla prices but after only a few weeks I'd say you paid too much (because of unrealistic fleecers).    That said,  you have it.   So all that being said,  you made a saving versus waiting.
---
  Swings and roundabouts.    Who's to really say?   You had the gold and you were prepared to pay it.  That's how the market works I guess.
---
What server are you on, my experience is the EXACT opposite.  I need to find a new home!
---
&gt;  I try to play as much as I can (and want) and I'm 30. I have enough to think about
---
not to mention, some days i just want to fish and shit. But having the idea that the content might update before I hit 60 makes it where i feel like i'm wasting time. and that's not cool
---
You need to try to rngegsus
---
Yup, this is why I’m on a PvE server. Not because of gankers, but because of the toxic attitude with lots of players. It seems to attract sociopaths, and it makes sense. The idea of PvP servers is to show you are better than the other player. Of course, there are more social friendly players on PvP servers than toxic players, but on PvP servers it is more likely to run into a antisocial person compared to a PvE server. At least, that is my experience. But they excist on both.
---
The night elf zones are the most beautiful in the game bar none
---
Talking about hunter pets here. Are YOU sure you are in the right place?
---
I don't want a reset, whether it's a progression reset or a TBC expansion. I just want to play the damn game.
---
Poke it with your staff
---
some of us have lived through that scenario many a time over the past 14 years.  It is annoying and completely avoidable.
---
Can you still have fun with the game as a casual player? I really enjoyed playing WoW years ago. Kinda just running around exploring and doing quests.
---
Ok so it isn’t even worth worrying about really?
---
How did wow force you to do that?
---
That’s ur personal opinion and I like netherwings. If you don’t that’s fine
---
Damn, I never thought to min-max my leveling at 35
---
&gt; There's something about this "meta" that pisses me off, probably since it's such a retail mentality, everything must be rushed and everything must be optimal. I hate it.
---
i dont get why people keep coming to these conclusions "its the retail mentality" "everyone must RUSH". when as a mage, i just want to aoe man. i dont wanna press frostbolt a billion times, which will be my life in raids.
---
id rather frost nova, cone of cold, arcane explosion, blizzard, all while maintaining proper positioning and watching mana use. frostbolt you literally have none of that, just stand and press your preferred key all day like a good boy. 
---
im not saying aoeing is intense gameplay or something but its more enjoyable than single target dpsing to me as a mage. choosing to do aoe groups is picking what i enjoy, not whats the fastest.
---
It should, but its currently a little wonk.
---
Logged in and turned in a quest lmfao
---
What bag addon is this?
---
I appreciate your in depth explanation while baked. This actually answered a lot of my questions. I never realized how much goes into being a hunter until after I completed the pet quest and got my pet. Hence why I'm asking for some tips because holy moly. Plus I like reading everyone else's experiences.
---
what is AC
---
I mean to each their own. I wouldn't be caught dead playing wow without a mouse/keyboard.
---
You do you if you like playing that way that's cool. I think it's super cool that you can do this(I remember during bc my buddy remote logged into his desktop and was playing on his laptop at our bi-monthly poker night and thinking that was the coolest thing ever) it's just not for me
---
Drain tanking is TBC. Sure you can do it on vanilla with Siphon Life+Drain life, but it will never be as efficient as Voidwalker+Dots
---
You have a personal tank, no need to tank yourself
---
And so? WHY downvote? Is it asking, or checking my memory a bad thing?
---
The truth is that on Reddit, in every sub, shit is upvoted and questions are downvoted instead of answered. This is sick.
---
You are part of the problem. When someone like you is upset with the pulling pace it makes it even worse. If the tank isn't in first they get less or no rage off the jump and the takes 3x as long to get threat back/keep threat.
---
That sucks. Thanks for sharing.
---
wonderful :D
---
Yeah
---
People stuck in 2006 mindsets.
---
I adventure into Teldrassil and end up in GM Island
---
Thanks! That makes sense. Looks like I will need another trip to the trainer. Hope unlearning pet talents doesn’t get more expensive each time..
---
This is getting out of hand, now there’s two of them
---
Just dont play Warrior and youll be fine
---
Cosplays are so cringeworthy
---
I was there on alliance side. Over half of us portalled to ironforge after destroying crossroads.  I personally returned to astranaar to keep fishing and there was no horde comeback there.
---
They’ve been working on classic wow for 2-3 years at the very least. That’s not including any sort of business planning or scoping. Now is definitely the time to start preparing for what’s next.
---
&gt; mainly because all classic content is going to be torn through very quickly and no one knows where we go from there
---
not my fault. There's 2 different factions, 10 different races, and 9 different classes.
---
slow down maybe? The game hasn't even been out a month, you shouldn't be demanding story boards lol
---
It's like that scene with the ship of ghosts in LotR lol
---
I get that, plus politics, and spam of the sword that shall not be named, pretty often.
---
Just peole having a conversation that could be in /w.
---
Heck ya, when I was young and crappy at the game, the fact that there was content that I simply wasn't good enough to do was a huge motivation to improve and work towards
---
Don't get me wrong, they pulled void elves and night borne out of their assets, but zandalari trolls the did not
---
Salutations!
---
Sometimes. But that only works on one target.
---
I'm in full healer gear as a level 25 druid... in Hillsbrad.
---
Delegalize Barrens Chat
---
My friends and I just made our own guild.  MC and BWL are pretty simple mechanics wise that I'm just going to roll through as feral.
---
Well the concept is simple. You invest more time into the game, you progress further into the game. 
---
I was in a semi-casual guild and no one really was very serious about raiding, until one day we thought “hey why not. Let’s try a raid”. It was fun so we started doing it once a week, then twice a week. You can’t say that’s hardcore in any way, shape or form, but eventually we ended up in blackwing lair. We reached nefarian, we were all getting nice gear.
---
We could basically show off with that gear in orgrimmar or have fun in battlegrounds. You didn’t have to beat AQ and Naxx to feel like you’re doing something. I’m sure if we kept going and had more time, we would have eventually reached Naxx... but that’s not the goal. The goal is to have fun, to slowly progress and see new things, to evolve your character. It doesn’t need to happen in the shortest time possible. 
---
I’m in the same boat as you. I won’t be raiding 5 times per week. I’m older now and I have other stuff to do. But I’m still looking forward to raiding every now and again, or just doing pvp and playing with the auction house. There really is no rush to do anything. That’s the beauty of vanilla wow. You have time to play? Play. If you don’t, well at least there’s no stupid weekly caps to fulfill
---
Taladril is much more conservative on the issue than say, someone like Skarm or myself, or any speedrunning guild.
---
The speedrunning meta of using a bear and a fury/prot is pretty well established at this point, not sure why people try so hard to disagree with it.
---
That's how it is!
---
I play warrior.
---
Thing is, I said KILL quests, as in "Kill x of y". NOT "rare drop" quests. Those annoy me too, but they're more prevalent in vanilla than in TBC if I recall correctly. But if the combat system is enjoyable enough, and I realize it's a rare drop, I can just zone out for a while and relax. And if you don't wanna do that, then skip that quests. That's part of the game too, the fact that you DON'T have to do every single quest.
---
I mean I've seen people like this on PvE servers too, even back in the original vanilla...
---
It does, but it's much more cheap than talents.
---
Its waaay easier than you think. 1 run takes about 3 minutes and the drop chance is about 50%. Instance-cap is the only bottleneck.
---
Of course that in this patch, or even after are yellow. I can see it.  
---
I mean BEFORE this patch. 1.0 or so.  
---
The meaning of my post is that this is not as Vanilla as we can get, they chose to make Classic over a patch that were already softened.
---
Cry me a river
---
Well I haven't played Vanilla but since 2004 I have moved yet another country and I'm independent now. :D
---
I’m a bad player. No doubt. 
---
If I were an action gamer, I wouldn’t play an RPG. 
---
Story and community are 1000x more important to me than difficult, action-oriented challenges.
---
Also remember the apothecary quarter is right underneath the flight master.
---
Ayyyy 🤘🏽🤘🏽
---
YOU SHUT IT
---
I met old guildmates in the attack on the undercity scenario (the one that got removed) totally by accident. It was pretty sweet :)
---
70/30 pop have fun
---
Do you find playing casually fun? Then yes, you can have fun while playing casually
---
I dont know, if hes like every other shadow priest who mind blast from the first second.
---
It could still be rough, even with his own groups.
---
Been maining enhancement shaman basically the entire time I've ever played WoW, from Vanilla to Cata, and then later on private servers. You gotta pump agility up, agility and only agility at all times to constantly push out those big crits.
---
I really don't care in fact I wish him well.
---
&gt; It's around that mid 40s mark since that's where plate actually starts from. It usually takes a few levels before people are completely in plate though
---
Accordingly, a bear tank is a remarkably better tank right at 40 than a warrior.
---
I just finished a failed run of Gnomeregan. It took over two hours from finding a full party to communally giving up after the second wipe, and I had so much fun! We were all random strangers to each other, but we were joking around and helping eachother, laughing at the warlock being chased out of the instance by some troggs,... 
---
I stopped playing at the start of Cata and never found another game that could keep my interest as much as wow ever could, but now I finally have.
---
Feels good when you get upper hand on better pvping classes
---
 Was questing in queldana lodge in hinterlands all of a sudden I get hunters marked and see a wolf charging me, I quickly kite the half health mob inside to LoS the hunter before he can get a shot off. Now I focus down the mob pop a health potion to stay topped off and not a second later this pet is on me, I stay in LoS killing his pet until he decides to pull it back. Then he decides to sacrifice his pet to my axe. Now without a pet and still in LoS I knew he would be forced to engage me in melee range, for a moment I thought he would reconsider but then he charged in enraged by my slaying of pupper. As he reached the edge of the doorway I spammed my intimidating shout just as I was entrapped in his frost trap, there I was encased in ice ready to hamstring his dick to the floor and he by good fortune was feared in place.
---
Then suddenly the fear broke and I had thawed it was an all out melee brawl and the hunter felt the blade of my axe CHUNKING his puny hp bar, as he laid before me dead I mourned his stupidity,  I may never destroy a hunter ever again
---
Dont forget Mana Burn and Dispel Magic. Mana Burn for obvious reasons. Dispel Magic can be used to remove debuff on you or used to remove buffs from enemies. Taking someone's fortitude can do as much "damage" as a spell sometimes.
---
This man helped me get my ww axe, im so greatly for his assistance! big shout out to him! first time posting in a long time sorry.
---
Try it and see if you enjoy it.  Just like any game.
---
GROB MOB
---
druid tanks are ok but it's a 1 per raid kinda thing and meanwhile dps warriors are also great whereas dps druids are a complete clusterfuck.  At endgame druids are mostly healers but in 5 mans you must bring another class with res, so that means you have one more hurdle when forming your groups, and in the end it's not as good as a priest or pally healer for really anything.  People know this stuff because it's been kinda common knowledge that druids in vanilla were this way since...vanilla.  So given the options people make the easy choice and go warrior for tanking, or priest/pala/shaman for healing.  What's left is some die-hard druid class fans and a smattering of noobs who don't know what they're doing to begin with.
---
It’s a lot more accurate than my anecdotal experience. I’m not playing classic but I’m still interested to see how the real world damage logs play out. 
---
As others have said there were private servers so I’m 99.9% sure I’m wrong. It’s almost tempting to play again just to see for myself.
---
Pick a PVP realm you won't regret it. The realm time aka EST is a reflection of what region the server is hosted. Go with a high/full realm, you don't want to be stuck on a dead server in a few months.
---
THANK YOU. 
---
This comment just needs to become the comment on the sidebar. "don't like it? don't play it. please don't fuck with this game" especially when we're not even a fucking month into it!. Demanding story boards when the game hasn't even been out for a month is literally absurd
---
Damnit! Fits without spaces I guess, but that probably looks terrible.
---
Another Undercity Elevator Victim :( Rip
---
What in tbc is hard?
---
Oww.
---
Eh, I understand. I've just done so much grind for skills and jobs that the thought of having to do it again kinda bums me out, but I understand.
---
Cheers!
---
It is obvious I'm talking about in a group.  If you want to purposely misconstrue my meaning in order to win an imaginary argument then go ahead but nobody is saying to give water to randos.
---
Your post got downvoted because you talk like you're entitled and that because there's a mage, he should, by default, fill your need for food or water and that a simple "Excuse me" or "Please" is too much because of how high and mighty you are.
---
Have a good say sir.
---
It’s for a church honey, NEXT!
---
Oh I already did. Joined a warrior on a quest, I did most of the work (I’d say about 80%), when we were done his only few words were: ‘give food’. Yeah, noo.
---
Hillsbrad near that dalaran sphere thing.  It’s along the water.

it is way more than 10% additonal damage.  you cant block, you don't have the defensive stance bonus in additon to zerker stance.  That and in then situation described the healer is having to try to keep 2 targets up instead of 1.
---
Its not your fault, pets are garbage on this Classic. Hunter pets cant hold aggro either
---
Does dual wield in this version have the hard cap of 19% miss rate that was present in early vanilla, or the version at the end that let you gear more hit?
---
Hmm..I wish I could find the posts on this sub, but there were population posts for servers showing 8-10k PER FACTION during the stress tests. Now, we know now that they are layering each server to hell at this point, but I believe they have mentioned in multiple interviews that they would have at least 4 layers for each server. They did release a blue post not long ago saying they were going to increase the size of each server.
---
Essentially, we could be looking at 10k per layer and 4-5 layers per server = 50k people.
---
4 runs in I got it. Just as I hit 37 too sorry bro.
---
At least you gained some xp. Hope your runs were efficient
---
What are we looking at?
---
Nah you tried to be one of the many pedants on reddit but didn't understand that I was just making a joke.
---
It's gonna take me years to tear through all content with all/most classes so i wish for no extra content no wipes. I do want TBC tho but that should be it's own thing so you can enjoy both.
---
Classic is trending
---
You're really milking this thing...
---
I see Alliance and retards are drawn to eachother :)
---
FOR THE HORDE !
---
"Druids can't tank!"
---
"We've seen Druids tank almost every bit of content in Vanilla, though."
---
"That's because Vanilla content is piss easy!"
---
"..."
---
I dunno, it's like the retard Olympics in here sometimes. We've got raids in this game with less mechanical sophistication than LFR on retail. Raids where it was well known even when it was cutting edge progression content that half the 40 man roster was often dead weight caught standing in fire or picking their nose at 5 frames per second, and people still cleared the content.
---
But no...we need to min max this shit. Better min max Deadmines too while we're at it. Make sure we polish up that Hogger group. Don't @ me, ret Pallies. Mages and Fury only for my Hogger groups.
---
No it was a legit question. But I see now that it was apparently bugged.
---
Gotcha. Just wasn’t sure if there was some mechanic happening that I didn’t know about.
---
I tell warlocks that if they have a renew on them then they better be tapping. I even tell them "the fuck dude tap". The longer the fight takes the more mana I use. I want it done asap
---
Legends right there
---
Best UBER 10/10
---
That flint water is brutal man, I'm telling ta!
---
Aren’t those just repeatable?
---
Get rekr
---
Not sure tbh since they’re always either in a group or a few levels higher. Rogues frustrate me with their stuns and locks with their fear (shoulda rolled dwarf) and mages can run off too easily with blink.
---
They still can't be immune to crushing blows which if you get a couple in a row you have a dead tank.  You can't heal through that kind of damage easily and you can't do it more than once in a fight.   It doesn't matter how high their defense and armor is if a boss hits you twice in a row for 75% of your max health.
---
Basically this.  People pay what they want to pay.   If people are desperate they will pay more.   That pushes the market price up to a point where people can't pay, so the price drops again.
---
  Still at this point, after only a few weeks,  I wouldn't want to pay as much as OP did.  There isn't that much gold in the economy to sustain multiple sellers selling at that rate.   However,  if people have the gold and want to pay it, then that shouldn't be discourages.    
---
Take advantage now my friends if you do have the gold though.  200 and something gold is a lot now, but if you wait a few months and see the prices then, you'll be laughing.
---
I was really looking forward to explaining the finer points of a doosra, a googly, and a chinaman.
---
Ah ok it sounded differently when I read it. I’m ok with some Quality of Life stuff, but catchup mechanics just invalidate the whole “world “ experience.
---
Are you the ninja looter?
---
I don't really give a shit about some pug you did quests with.  It's obvious I'm talking about actual dungeon groups.  If you want to misconstrue what I said in order to win a non-existent argument then go for it but nobody is arguing you need to give water to randos.
---
What I would like is less Classic Plus and more Burning Crusade Minus.
---
In my opinion, TBC was the best the game has ever been before or since. However, it definitely did have introduce some negative things. So this could be a chance to add all of the good and none of the bad.
---
So TBC, _except_:
---
- No flying. (Only a few areas required flying to reach, and those could be minorly reworked with ramps or teleporters.)
---
- No dailies.
---
- No arenas.
---
- Other than that, no changes.
---
I know there are some people who have issues with resilience and with gear from Heroics, but I think those were positive things. Allowing differentiation between pve and pvp gear, while still making each pretty good for the other, is useful. And giving non-raiders challenging content that gives good rewards is crucial.
---
As to people asking that we keep the level cap at 60: fine, as long as we _do_ get the new abilities, deeper talent trees, and more talent points somehow.
---
He said "expected" to dps. Youre not expected to dps if youre a healer. You do if you feel like nothing can go wrong
---
MC and Onyxia were blizzard's first attempt at a raid. They are boring, easier than anything else you can do at 60 and have poor loot implementation to boot. 
---
It's funny, actually, what people expect from phase 1 raids. Clearly 90% of the current classix playerbase has never done Molten Bore and Ony. People are going to be very disappointed.
---
Classic raiding starts at BWL.
---
I would like to know too
---
All good, friend. Happy hunting!
---
Firstly what level are you. Secondly never smite. Either wand or Mind flay. PVP on a priest is all about mana management. The wand is your best friend here and your primary source for damage. Honestly especially before Shadow form. Wand should be most of your damage.
---
Keep in mind especially if you have improved wands which you should. Wands deal more damage then a 2 handed weapon. So all you really wanna do. Is keep your dot up and keep your shields up then heal when you need too. Mana burn is a great spell but don't use it a lot. wait till they are already at least at 1/3 mana. Because it's not always a good spell to use.
---
Right?!? I mean that song "Short people have no reason to live" was made for a reason after all.
---
I swear I noticed a moonwell at the Feralas fp next to 1k.
---
You swing, enemy dodges to the left, you try to make the 200iq play and anticipate him dodging right with your second swing. You miss.
---
Wow those soundeffects though
---
🦀$11🦀
---
You say you get kicked with no explanation after they invite you. Can you elaborate? I would like to help cause that sounds weird. 
---
Let's say you /join LookingForGroup and see someone saying "LF3M RFC. need healer and dps". What do you do?
---
You could change the distance in vanilla. This is a change.
---
Do you have armory links? Cause that's obscene luck if true. A complete outlier
---
Good areas for rogue to level in and for quest gear? Lvl 29 rogue rn
---
I have zpearl UI to keep easier track on people's hp and mana, and then use f1-f5 keybindings to navigate around/through the party members.
---
I tried Clique but personally it confused me more than I should admit, considering how easy and straight forward the add-on is..
---
&gt;  to minimize the chances Blizzard does the wrong thing
---
lol no. The best way to minimize the chances Blizzard does the wrong thing is by not having future changes. Just let us enjoy the game. Fuck people still play Diablo 2 to this day, shit doesn't have to change or develop. If that's what you want go play retail
---
Made 3 characters. First two are level 18-20 and never got a bag drop.
---
Third one got a bag on the first kill, followed by 3 more bags before level 10. I had mailed him bags to begin with, so I was able to vendor those for 2.5s each which is a lot at those levels.
---
You are aware you can create your own groups, aren't you?
---
I love doing it to rogues, it makes my heart happy
---
Also preemptively prevents potential gankage
---
I just look at it like a clock to find things.
---
I haven't been seeing this at all on my server. We taking Herod or something?
---
And let mages have a way to break their entire team's polymorph/blind/charm/gouge/sap/grenade/repentance effects with a percentage chance to break fear and root as well? Sign me up, this clearly needs to be a part of the game!
---
I got mad when he died because I couldn't heal him for some reason.. 0/10 escort quest would not recommend ):

definitely not from a Jedi
---

---
They don't need better gear, you basically just need one MT healer who knows what pre-casting is.
---
A priest or a druid pre-casting Greater Heal/Healing Touch will negate any crushing blow the druid might get.
---
That's not even taking into account the increased health pool making a crushing blow much less troublesome.
---
If you'd known your shit you'd know the real problem is critical strikes, which are 200% damage compared to the 150% of the crushing blows. If a druid isn't up to snuff on defense (which can happen) those are going to be a real pain in the ass for healers.
---
Honestly a crushing blow is no big deal at all, because of the high health pool of druid.
---
Source: Have healed a druid tank throughout all classic dungeons.
---
I aoe grinded 16 years ago and I don’t understand why you’d presume to tell other people what it’s about.
---
It hs more to do with the time spent creeeeping sooo slowwwwly from mob to mob.  It's a lot faster to throw a knife and go ham.
---
My, you're a tall one!
---
The whole city is color coordinated, go to the center and look at the color of the drapery over each of the archways, they correspond to one of the four quarters.

Who cares? If that's not how the majority of players play, we shouldn't be catering to giving them new content ASAP
---
[Check this shit outout](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.1)
---
This was the pre-BC patch where the game was changed in preparation for it before release.
---
Item #1, front and center **Looking for Group** tool interface added to the game.  You can see a link on there to show you the tool.
---
[Here's the website as it looked in Dec 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20061230010101/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/lookingforgroup.html)
---
Now off with your lying ass.
---
Waaay to many sound effects.
---
Save them for a bit after phase 3 starts.  Twinks in that bracket will want them.
---
So many gnomes
---
Why do yall cover your names? o.O
---
How do you precast a random crushing blows that can take up to 75% of your health?
---
By people who leveled to 60 and got attuned to the raid, and also farmed consumables and i assume at least partial pre raid bis gear in 2 weeks. That isnt an average player. 90%+ of the playerbase that started day 1 are not 60 yet.
---
Same and I also flip 3 stacks of silk for 1g and AH my 8 slot bags quick flipping like 6-8s each
---
Which is?
---
+1 Honor!
---
Thanks for the correction
---
Only going for 400g on my server lol. Like 6 listed to.
---
There is usually room for at least one enh shaman in most raid groups to give windfury totem to melee dps and to wield that one axe (I forget the name, night-something?)
---
It's a game, Chad. Calm down. I'm technically in mail cause I have a life outside of gaming. You know, /r/outside stuff.
---
While I get it, tbc didn’t add any of the things you listed other than a summoning stone.
---
Priest: /w guildmate69 the tank in this dungeon is so bad /wrists
---
Shout it from the rooftop!!!
---
Sick and tired of this shit
---
"Extremely disrespectful" lmao
---
Oh for sure. I'd argue bear is better than warrior all the way till 60. Warrior doesnt take the edge until they start getting some early level tier in my opinion
---
Gratz to the Server first, and also GO Alliance :D
---
Note...dungeons not raids
---
Can I play ret at endgame without being a streamer being fed gear? I actually rather enjoy the spec.
---
Have had literally not a single issue finding groups as fucking shadowpriest, ur just not looking for groups
---
You don’t need a shield to tank stuff anyway so blocking is irrelevant. And yeah it’s probably more like 17% instead of 10% but that isn’t enough to make the large gap you describe
---
I hate karma whores and content thievery. Guess what bud: you fit both categories.
---
Exactly. I'm level 32 right now, but ideally i'd still be in my early 20s. I like to do things slow. Hey I need to level up my tailoring, I'm gonna go farm wool cloth. Would it more efficient to level up and come back to do that? Sure but that's not enjoyable to me
---
strange, i've been in one spellcleave group since I started playing. i probably have a hunter in 1/3 of my groups. find a guild and do guild runs, start your own groups, or just be persistent. plenty of people are doing these runs without spellcleave, and in my experience they're usually faster and more efficient.
---
Better than the threat generation of a weapon that was so overwhelmingly overpowered that it had to be nerfed the next expansion to get people to stop using it? Call me skeptical.
---
This would be a good one for a lock, but I mean shoulders at that level don't really offer much. Those effects really add up over time, but as a mage you really wont be taking consistent damage like a priest or lock. (Lock would life tap and get that regen going)
---
But won't you go oom all the time? I've started running with my int/spirit gear and my downtime seems to have dropped. You might very well have a point there but I just haven't been feeling it. I might also add that Stormstrike feels very useless while leveling, when other lvl 40 talents look very impactful on paper.
---
Questing or a dungeon while leveling is not exactly the same as raiding with a group of 40. It’s often just 1 or 2 people who want water or food, it’s not exactly hard to keep track of 1 person with a request. 
---
I’ve also had people ninja trading me in cities and questzones. I mean, seriously..? Just ask. I don’t even ask a tip.
---
What are you talking about? Nobody is asking Blizzard to change Classic. The discussion is about a Classic+ version, independent from the current Classic. Different realms. Those who want to play Classic forever should be able to do so.
---
And here I thought inflation would make it go up long term.
---
Apparently for suckers.
---
Why be in a slow group when now we know more about the game and spell cleave is the way to go. If you want the real experience stand around for hours like you are now looking for a group

---
My opinion:
---
- if it makes sense for you to go use it, need it;
---
- if it doesn't make sense for anyone to go use it (hyper expensive twink item, nobody's a twink), all need;
---
- if it makes sense for someone to use it, but that someone is not you, greed.
---
Weeell, so am I. We’ll get our mount gold, eventually.
---
We didn't have add-ons and wowhead immediately available, that probably made a huge difference.
---
Thanks for the advice. What should I do if it’s a melee class jumping around? Mind flay? I’ve wanded before but it’s annoying cause they get behind easily. I’m lvl 41 and thinking about respecting to full shadow.
---
This doesn't really solve the issue.  Even with invites blocked it still tells you in chatbox that they sent you the invite that was blocked by your setting, and more importantly you can't right-click report them.
---
That’s what I’m going for. I don’t mind the extra floating text.
---
I think I might do it
---
Who are we kidding? This is a socialist forum where people are too afraid of expressing their actual opinion because of suppression of PC-culture. You dont see me giving people a thumbs down without atleast expressing a tought first.
---
It’s always the same with you guys. Oneliners. PC-bullshit nobody actually stands for. It’s amusing, really.
---
Yeah yeah, bring it on. -20 karma in one go.
---
Yeah.. GL not caring about your healer's mana.
---
And, as they say, what is good for the goose is good for the gander.  Either game doing well helps the other, and we shouldnt hope for classic's success at the expense of retail's demise, we should hope both games learn from each other and succeed in their own space.
---
it's more of it can feel like flushing 15$ down the toilet if you aren't able to play because your leveling areas are constantly filled with 60's ganking. Because if you can't play during your couple hours after work because of everyone ruining the leveling, it's better off buying a different full game for 15$ and dropping wow.
---
Yes sell it now!!! Soon it will cost 1 gold
---
As someone who life taps...
---
Don't heal them. They shouldn't be life tapping unless they are prepared to heal themselves up. This really should only be done in 5mans if they're drain tank specced.
---
Will there be (free) realm migration in the future?
---
Wish everyone would do this. Also, you can right click the channel name in chat and open a new window for it. Really helpful
---
That's impressive af.
---
Ele shamans are bad for farming gold until DM come out. After that your aoe the non-elite plants in DM N. 
---
Your a one spell andy in pvp like warlocks you just cast LB until the cows come home. As long as you have Dark runes and mana pots. You should be able to maintain mana for long enough to kill bosses.
---
No problem man, just hmu if you need any help. If you want maximize damage leave growl off and use it to only pull aggro onto your pet the one time. Leave (I'm assuming you're using bite) bite on auto so that way your pet spends its mana only on the one growl and then the rest all towards bite. You dont really want another growl to go off. If you play with a tank leave it off it will only make their job harder.
---
Those are a different genre of games with their own different limitations.  Not everyone who plays a PC game is interested in all 3.  I've never played a Battle Royal game in my life so I would not be in their potential market.
---
Not to mention the PC gaming market being radically different between 2008 and 2019.  Steam has gone from about 15 million accounts to 65 million in that time period.
---
Preference is a thing. just like a girl will say she prefers a tall guy, I prefer mine with bodies like this. 
---
the only person to imply/infer their value lay only in their number on a scale was you..

nothing he said was factually false. the vast majority of men are attracted to slim/toned women. the obesity rates ARE skyrocketing.. you were the one who did the mental gymnastics to try and REEE patriarchy it..
---
Ha me too with my druid. My friend hates me lol
---
Heresy! After all, it was Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne(2003) that introduced the Pandaren Brewmaster as a playable Tavern hero, with several abilities also seen in MoP monk class.
---
But nobody remembers that! Everyone saw Kung Fu Panda(2008) and thought oh you copycat Blizzard you.
---
incorrect. If classic wow just stays classic wow, you don't have to feel rushed. You can get to the end when you want. I've played on pservers for years and everyone was content with nothing changing, why does it have to change now that the company who fucked everything up is hosting the server?
---
I would not mind if they followed the original BC/WotLK release schedule as they did orignally allowing players to choose to saty on classic or move/copy a toon to new servers with TBC running and then the same as WotLK releases. That way we could all play the versions we love most. It would shift the playerbases around but it would bring in more new people and after several months and alts at 60 I would love to progress through TBC and others again.
---
This is actually awesome. Wonder if this sub is the place for old player friends to post and be like "Eggshellz from Wyrmrest Accord looking for Celerystix from WOTLK days"
---
I have always been talking about actual dungeon groups not you randomly grouping up for quests.  This is so typical of reddit.  Find some minor nitpick and focus on that instead of the actual point I was making.
---
It’s like if you are a paladin taking to the priest trainer and he goes on about how you aren’t attuned to the light, or something like that.
---
2 tiers? Im assuming by how you've worded it that the tiers are the 2 rolls. 1 dropping 1 titanforge. Sadly, a full titanforge rolls 8 times after the initial drop roll. Whether or not socket and tertiary stats roll before that or after, I don't know. Far more than 2 tiers of rng however.
---
Does one Pally represent the entire community?
---
This is my favorite wow video ever
---
How is a crocolisk for a hunter's tank pet? I've tamed one early on and so far it's done a great job, but I was wondering if a bear/boar/turtle would do better..
---
Mines going right in my bank
---
The minor pieces aren't as much of a concern for me since it's the main slot pieces that affect your character's appearance the most and that will partly determine what race/gender my rogue will be because I'd rather not look terrible in endgame gear.
---
I never described a gap.  I am a new person pointing out that you were wrong about damage reduction.  Blocking is not Irrelivant.  I am sure you have done what you said, but that doesn't change the fact that your statment about objective facts was incorect.
---
X hits you for 5288 (crushing)
---
He was Alliance though
---
Oh poor mages. They only get to teleport everywhere, get free water and food and are only the most busted class in the whole game. Whatever will they do!
---
What does this mean? Never done this quest...
---
How many posts do I have to reply to saying the same fucking thing?
---
&gt; Not the best way of doing it at all but I like the challenge.
---
so much fucking this. I don't care about doing things the most efficiently. I like just going out and doing something for the reward even if I'll dump it in a couple levels
---
I don't want to have to worry about doing everything efficiently because otherwise the new content will come out and i'll miss out on what was
---
run it today and hunter got it, warrior passed for some reason lol
---
in retail mana is a no issue so multi dotting is easy, you also have mind sear which is like aoe mind flay, ii barley played bfa so cant even remember what kind of aoe they have there
---
Are the extra procs really that much more dps?
---
So many good memories of my guildies WF proc in the first 5 secs of dps while I was my getting threat up. He got blown up by bosses A LOT.
---
You know in game Whitemanes armor has always been seen as pretty hoochie. But when she sits like that it looks pretty fucking badass.
---
Resto can drop WF
---
They are on ah for 20g now on skeram. Price dropped from 70g in about 48 hours so sell it fast
---
what's the dps? :o
---
There are just as many if not more players slightly younger than you that fondly remember TBC or Wrath in the same way that you remember classic. For everyone of you that raided during highschool/college for Classic there are more that did it during TBC and wrath. Many, many, many people would LOVE to see TBC or classic+, and blizzard isn't going to cater exclusively to the extreme casual audience, sorry.
---
thanks for your message!  can you share what kind of talent setup you used?  is it combat daggers?  or assassination daggers that you used?  is it setup for mainly backstabbing?

Is Ravager better than Bonebiter?

You'll notice while the other stats are form dependent, the int increase is always active.

You have the 20% extra int in all forms, it never goes away.

Interest yah in ah pint?!

except there being classic+ content IS reason to rush. I don't see how you don't understand that. New content tends to phase out old content. that's how it has pretty much always worked in WoW.

This is happening tonight be ready!

#flatzeroth confirmed
---
It’s been so long I forgot, do fees for respeccing have a cooldown or something like that? I think I remember it constantly doubling or something insane like that so that you can’t respec often on a single character before you hit a ceiling in the form of a virtually unobtainable amount of gold. How does it work in 1.12?
---
Sounds like a you-problem.

All he had to do to win that was stand and wand you lol

" hurr durr Classic is so hardcore omg retail is a casual shit" 
---
&gt;Classic raid is cleared on first week by lvl 58s
---
I think ZF has one boss at 48, the rest at 45-47. Its probably doable for a 44 tank if you have a reliable healer and at least competent DPS.
---
You can't fix stupid.

It sounds like a bunch of tradables that when combined become soulbound

---
Alot
---
are you saying being unable to play the game due to other players killing all quest givers and camping the questing areas is what the game is all about?
---
Because i enjoy classic for it's small scale stories, cohesion of the world, the sense of scale and the more unique class flavor that is missing from the modern game.
---
Op must not be a Druid

That's a weird way of putting it. Their souls were harvested by Guldan to open the Dark Portal, right?

Phrasing!
---
Idk man Armor of the Fang is a cool set

I’m human but recently learned I probably should have rolled dwarf. Thanks for the tips.
---
I'd just like to add this same hivemind mentality caused Elemental Shamans and Fire Mages to be completely trashed on in the beginning of BfA even after they received buffs to compensate for their poor performance.
---
Unfortunately min-maxing is the one thing that seems to consistently trickle down into the majority of the playerbase and have a long lasting perception.
---
As a lower level warrior, I usually stick around to help them kill. I'm going to have to grind mobs eventually right? Good for both parties. 
---
But like others have said, it's ok to bounce! Nothing keeping you there and they should understand. Communicating shouldn't be that hard!
---
The totems only affect your party.  A resto shaman will be in the healer party for Mana spring and Mana tide totems.
---
It was ridiculous to ever expect that to be the case.  I was laughing my ass off the first ~week when everyone was holding hands and singing kumbaya over how amazing and inviting and accepting the Classic community was, and how you can play anything at any level with any gear and be accepted into all kinds of groups and runs and this and that.  Hello, the player base is the same.  It took like a single-digit number of days for the novelty to completely wear off and for people to want to get the fuck down to business.
---
I always wait til everyone rolls to see what people will roll need or green on boe

Like I said, everything is situational. Range pulling mobs is a great way to control your environment and not pull to many mobs. Other people in this thread made great points about utilizing the rogue toolkit to cc a group of mobs and take them out one by one. Op of this thread made a comment saying that stealth was useless without cheap shot (and kidney for some reason) which even  the point you're making doesn't match up with.
---
The content will be torn through extremely quickly by everyone, not just the top 1%. Once the curve is at 60 you'll see pug groups for raids and a level of activity at the endgame that wasn't present in classic. The game has evolved mechanically, and the player base grown more skilled by extreme margins. Nothing in classic is mechanically a challenge when it comes to raiding. Your average casual heroic guild on retail would have no problem clearing all content in classic.
---
What the actual fuck was that damage though.
---
Jackpot.
---
Turalyon was a badass....until legion
---
ZF, tanked it w/o too much problem at 44. Besides if you're just running xp farms you won't fight any bosses in there.
---
What kind of mouse do you have? A lot of mice can have their buttons programmed for anything or even macros assigned to them. Although I have never tried to assign a key to a mouse button so I may be wrong.
---
Druid's Natures Grasp only works outside, so I'm wondering if it is worth the talent points if I'm primarily leveling through dungeons as a druid tank.
---
Which, if any, Classic Wow Dungeons have outside zones?
---
Actually most of the time in pvp shock is a trap. You never wanna be close enough to shock. Basically you heal to create space for yourself and nuke anyone you can when you have an opportunity. I generally only end up shocking when people break into my zone of control and, are coming at me. It's more of a defensive CD then a spell you would use to kill.
---
Most of the time your are better off spamming healz, a lightning bolt, or using your global's to purge. Keep in mind unless everyones positioning is fucked you should never really be close enough to a caster to interrupt with earth shock and, you have no ability to get back out of melee range if a melee closes the gap. So you really wanna stay out of charge range.
---
Bro I'm not demanding shit. I'm saying let people talk about the game they love
---
There are free migrations going on now from overpopulated realms, but only to specific destinations (low-med pop servers). 
---
Whether Blizzard opens up a general realm transfer in the future where anyone can go anywhere...no one knows. But if they do I wouldn’t expect it to be free.
---
that might be the reason. good catch!
---
Shut the fuck up warlock and pala 100% mount's quest is not here until phase 2 and I want my evil poney !!
---
!remindme 10 hours
---
I dont see how anything I said was bitter. Thats literally just how it is for a mage. You spend a lot of time drinking. As for tips, this dungeon meta of just aoeing everything to death is going to have you oom quick. not sure what lvl you are but just keep popping mana gems, evocation, and pots. When you're out on your own and just single targeting use your wand whenever you can.
---
Yeah no need for a tank when you have a feral druid, holy Paladin and an arms warrior in the same party at level 20 for DM/WC.
---
Some were knights, such as Uther and Mograine.  Others were priests, such as Turalyon.  Arthas was raised briefly as a warrior before joining the Order of the Silver Hand - though the neglect of attention from his father lead to him starting much later in arms training (12 years old) than his peers such as Jaina (magic training) and Varian (who started learning swordsmanship at 8).
---
“Low effort meme” is subjective. Example, you seem to think the cosplay is somehow low effort. Well the effort put into the cosplay clearly isn’t, nor is it a meme.
---
You also have to factor in something’s such a humor value or how interesting it is. Yes, these are subjective as well, but if it gets a lot of traffic and ample enough conversation and upvotes, it holds enough value in one or both of those fields to warrant it being kept.
---
Even in /r/competitivewow, there have been obviously low effort posts that were kept because a genuinely informative discussion was generated within the comments. So the initial post held little value, the entirety of the thread warranted the lack of removal.
---
You have to realize your standards are biased and do not align with the moderators or a majority of the community. You won’t find solely deep discussion about mechanics or gearing or whatever. We aren’t JUST discovering the game, it’s not new. Many are reliving something we’ve once known but long forgotten. With this nostalgia comes memes and silly inconsequential posts that produce nothing more than a “oh that’s cool”, and that’s perfectly fine.
---
If you are wanting a subreddit with only serious discussions regarding the game that is strictly moderated, as if ruled by a totalitarian regime, then go make /r/competitiveclassicwow. Let you be the heavy-handed moderator keeping everything on-topic all the time. That shit isn’t happening here, nor should it ever. Let people have their fun, let them share their joy in an old game they love (or are learning to love).
---
forsure, feral is definitely more efficient no question. I dug the balance play style though so i stuck with it. Just make sure to bring some water :p 
---
I didn't find it too terrible aside from having to drink a whole bunch, i thought the damage was decent and it's awesome to be able to root everything
---
Been playing on my note 8 with parsec. Plays pretty well.
---
Right clicking with two fing touch is a bit frustrating sometimes but with click to move and interact on left click turned on its playable.
---
You make a good point.
---
You don’t make an entirely new window for party chat and guild chat only? I do. I don’t bother with general chat.
---
They must only get two drinks. Last trendy bar I went to cost me 20$ per drink.
---
Oh, it’s a race thing. I see.
---
I'm not gonna lie, whenever I look at how will my shaman look in pre raid BIS, I almost want T mog in classic. There is just no way to look good in robes of the exalted.
---
I would be fine with that tbh but if i'm about to charge and someone body pulls something and starts hitting it and bringing it close to the group it breaks the whole opener. Starting rage gone, initial threat gen gone.
---
Honk honk!
---
I’m really sorry you’ve been having a bad experience thus far. The majority of players that I have run into playing Alliance on Fairbanks have overall been very helpful and friendly. I’m only a lvl 33 lock but if you ever want to group up with some people that aren’t “complete” assholes, shoot me your character name and would be happy to help you out sometime
---
Too bad Wowhead sucks for classic info. I keep finding so many things wrong.
---
In fact, just yesterday I was checking their guides on Argent Dawn rep. There's 2 guides and both say:
---
&gt; Elite mobs in the Plaguelands and normal mobs in Scholomance/Stratholme will grant reputation until 6000/12000 into Honored.
---
Except that's completely wrong. Mobs in Strath/Scholo continue to give reputation all the way to Revered. How do I know this? Because I spent all of yesterday spamming UD Strat and got to 9k/12k Honored, still gaining rep for each mob kill.
---
This is just one example, but basically every guide and page I've checked has had some information wrong. I've stopped using it completely now, there's better websites with more accurate information.
---
I played healer for a long time and my boy swanny is a god. most healers are actual babies about their mana
---
I've made food and water for anyone that asked and never got tips until the high level 40s. I think everyone before then is saving for mount/poor from buying mount. But now at higher levels people have started tipping I usually get 50s-2g. That's for a 6 stacks, but I've also had people our questing only ask me for 1 or 2 stacks and give me a gold each. I've never even ask for tips, it just seems once people aren't struggling for coin they are happy to tip.
---
Well that's rng and thrash blade is guaranteed. Sometimes you don't get a choice
---
for now. Gold will inflate over time. WoW has more gold sources than sinks.
---
ZF. Some groups won’t even take a tank as they are there just to farm trash for xp. 
---
I would maybe avoid doing a full clear of ZF for your first run or two. Plenty of groups skip a couple bosses because it’s pretty damn slow after a bit. So they just stick to trash mobs, specifically the graveyard. You could easily find a group to sneak in a level or two before you start trying full/quest runs
---
Is there a good resource or just way to know how to price things in AH. 
---
For instance I have a lvl 36 2H sword with +17 agi. I search up the exact item, but there are no matches. So I just search for weapons “of agi” but items shown have far less agi, the closest I see is a +11 agi sword. Should I try to extrapolate the price? Put up a price I think it’s worth to see if it sticks? Put it up for no buyout?
---
Buy my fucking bread!
---
Complete quests for darnassus related NPCs while leveling and then at max level just do a shit ton of runecloth turn ins
---
I’ve yet to see Blizzard post an exact number for server populations. Can you link to that post? Just curious.
---
Wetlands, hillsbrad
---
Pretty much, AQ mail has strength for Enh shamans, until then it's just agility which just helps you crit more.
---
*fantasy game with mythical creatures and magical abilities, decides to play human warrior*
---
Yeah but on the other side, itd be just as dumb for them to say "yeah I'll group but if anything valuable drops, I get it" it's better to just be "rude" and not group then end up losing out on a BoE from their standpoint.
---
What would här här be
---
I dunno why but I think old armor on old models looks better and more fitting (shape) than new armor on new models.
---
The hero we deserve
---
rekt
---
Same, auto downvote these so hopefully they stop popping up.  This isn't relevant info for anyone here.  His fans already watch, why post it here?  Downvote topic.
---
Yeah, reconnected with my old wow buddies after we'd all rolled on different servers... Also we can't transfer to the same new realm, rip.
---
 I've always thought that classic + isn't realistic just due to the stat system in wow, if they keep releasing better gear eventually you'll have rogues with ridiculous amounts of Dodge or bears with more health than 5 man bosses. I also fear that if they do it they'll hotfix unintended designs and have classes that are relevant as a result of player inginuity (feral tank/dps with crowd pummeler for instance) become bad again.  
---
Classic's always felt like a 1 time deal to me, I think blizzard would prefer just having people play retail so there's more customers for the blizzard store
---
Yeah thats true. I bought my Krol Blade on Pservers but only cuz I couldn't stand looking at Trash Blade while the rest of me was in t1.
---
Damn this dude plays with Bill Clinton?
---
By eat do you mean eat the life essence of our enemies?
---
Thanks for this! I'm at work so I couldn't read all of it just yet, but what I saw so far has already answered MANY important questions!
---
dont level doing hotw ns just respec at 60 to it
---
feline swftness is the best 2 talent points to spend to level faster
---
I think rogues are designed for solo play. Sneaking past mobs in caves to get to your quest target. Stealth to avoid fights in pvp and to start fights. 5 min cooldowns to fight elites etc. They are probably the third best solo class behind warlocks/hunters
---
If you log out sitting in a chair in a table at an Inn, you will log back in sitting at a table.
---
source: RP'd my Tauren getting drunk at the Booty Bay Inn before logging out a few nights ago, logged in the next day and he was still sitting in the chair.
---
shields are for noobz
---
But he didn’t mention 5 sunders....
---
Lol if that’s true then why are people ganking?
---
not an addon, just a setting.
---
Cool, so you're still going to be playing Classic, EXACTLY how it is right now, ten years down the line? You're still going to be running the same 4-5 raids, you're still going to be leveling alts, and you're still going to be actively participating?
---
Chances are, no. You're not. There's nothing wrong with that, but you're just not going to keep playing this game for ten years consecutively. Private servers have shown this with players jumping to and from servers rapidly following reaching max level on one. It's just not feasible.
---
That's why people want new content. It's not hard to understand, and honestly I have a hard time even fathoming somebody having difficulty in understanding the yearn for new content. It's probably because people want to keep playing the game they've invested hundreds/thousands of hours into, and they know that's not going to happen after Naxx. Just saying.
---
30 mins
---
&gt; I suppose you never finished Razorgore then, or at least not until level 70.
---
Nah, I'm probably just thinking about /assist macros then.
---
Am priest, rarely need to drink.
---
Its because some people just want super easy runs by bringing meta classes so they can be in and out.
---
These names are great.
---
I got my old name of my only gnome I ever played, Ratfood. Love it to death.
---
Let it be classic you fetus, why you talking about this?
---
Auberdine was one of my most missed parts of WoW after Cataclysm.
---
To any and all rogues reading this; PLEASE keep these gifs coming, I fucking love them.
---
What happened in March 2015 that caused OSRS numbers to surge?
---
And what are those semi-regular spikes in RS3 numbers?
---
No truer words spoken on this day September 13, 2019
---
Seen a couple doing it with mixed groups. Not the most efficient but works kinda.
---
Because we want a good game to get even better and not fall into an obscure stagnant state
---
Ravager is BiS for AoE dungeons farms, and most warriors will even have 1 in their inventory at 60 for trash clearing in dungeons.
---
2/2 feline swiftness is +30%. Travel form is +40%.
---
Use curse of recklessness to stop the fear effect, reapply a different curse to resume the fear effect. You can semi-control where the feared target goes by doing this.
---
How can you not find groups as a healer? That's ridiculous.
---
Yeah, I think it’s truly well done! Everything from the info itself to the presentation!
---
So at this point should I just stick it out, get 30 and save those two points?
---
Wrong. Fire mage was.
---
So I'm a level 30 prot warrior looking to do dungeons. Should I go with gnomer, rfk, or sm graveyard?
---
Sucks to be you. I haven't had one issue yet.  And if your getting kicked from groups that's highly suspect you may be contributing to the problem.
---
I was a 3min mage back in vanilla but for this go around, I’m rocking Lock...and I would love to make this happen.
---
It's definitely not an international American airlines flight, that's for damn sure. I just attempted this and the latency was 1 second (4x what OP said his was) and it disconnected you every 30 minutes so you had to reauth in their captive portal again.... And this is after paying them $18 for the service. American Airlines, get your shit together because that 30 minute disconnect is fucking atrocious.
---
Nice! Any addon working for dungeon maps yet?
---
Hunters still have Eagle Eye in retail? I guess I figured it got pruned.
---
Nah, kill them before you. I call it prevengence specially rouges and mages
---
Classic wow is probably one of the only communities I regularly check now.  If I’m at work and can’t play the story’s of world pvp or some great teamwork really can make my day.

Is it hard to find AOE dungeon groups with warlocks?

Classic needs work on class balance
---
Know one else understands the struggles of getting the WW axe.
---
Preach.
---
I tell you what, since you have the clear superior knowledge on server architecture and how layering works over my meager understanding of such, why not take a minute to exhibit this Galaxy brained posture.  Here is your opportunity to shine.  Show the world your understanding other than simple comments you can't be bothered with extorting.
---
All of those people suggesting server resets are welcome to delete their characters if they wish to experience the challenge again.  No thanks.
---
Happy to help! I went through this when I started because I only really played wow during Mists. I also thought you had to keep going to trainers to raise the cap like with professions but the cap is just 5/level unless you have weapon masteries that raise that cap. I’m planning to level a warrior alt at some point so I’ve been looking at guides, and I have some friends in my guild who are maining warrior so I can tell you the crescent staff is actually gonna be your best weapon from wailing caverns until around 30. So learning to use staves will also be necessary. Then you have a pretty difficult class quest to get the Whirlwind Axe at 30, and you’ll definitely need help if you want to get that early.
---
[Here’s a good guide](https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/warrior/leveling-1-60/) that I’ve been looking at, and section 10 has a weapon progression plan that looks solid.
---
That's the same as saying any study that uses a sample size smaller than the whole isnt remotely accurate.
---
They will touch it, sooner or later. I don't foresee Classic lasting for a decade with no changes.
---
Bold of you to assume that many people here even have a girl to look at them like that.
---
Have you tried adding spinach to your diet? Might help some.
---
It's still an amazing spot to aoe farm.
---
And a ton of bug fixes and balance changes. When people asked for Vanilla, they weren't specifically asking for 2004 launch day. I think their phase plan is a decent compromise. At least they didn't just pop it in at the last patch before BC. Even though that would have been fine with me.
---
Only one I know about is Triune Amulet (7 stam/int/spi necklace) but that's a BOP drop. Didn't know there's a BOE amulet that is common form SM.
---
People are their own worst enemy. Blizzard gave them an abusable system (Layering) coupled with abusable dungeon farming (8 man raid EXP) and suddenly, we've got AoE spam groups for days.
---
Even if people didn't "want" this, they are incentivized into doing it because it is the most efficient and effective way to level.
---
I'm almost nervous I'm gonna get downvotes for this but I rolled on a PvP server and kinda regret it? I don't remember putting so many people on ignore in Vanilla. I also did play on a PvE server in Vanilla. The general chat is absolutely filled with the most awful people and they go full blown Snowflake if anyone calls them out for saying awful shit.
---
Thinking I might just abandon the characters I leveled on the PvP server and start over on one of the PvEs.
---
Lol my gf giving me shit for, well, my smelly dumps
---
*cough* sfw only
---
Yeah he seemed rather confused!
---
they're probably just bitter after trying to quest in STV.
---
M[m]()***7
---
I’ve seen that look on some twos.  Doesn’t make them wrong lol.
---
Yeah, and resto tier gear is perfectly tailored towards PvP the way good druids embrace it: wear the enemy down with heals, bear form, stuns, roots and the like.
---
A good chunk of FC gear comes from druid tier gear and it's very easy to obtain, because there are only few druid spots in raids, but also very few people playing them.
---
Your taking about people who are so extremely passionate about this game they likely had beaten MC within a quarter of not a month of the release of classic. These guys are so passionate they knew exactly what heat they needed what spec to choose and exact heroes compostiom without having to look at anything. We're talking the extreme here. So passionate they refuse to pay attention to anything else in life.
---
I'd be surprised if that wasn't banned or flagged for a rename sooner rather than later, honestly.
---
How does Prot Pally generate threat? 
---
I'm only like level 13 levelling with a mate playing priest, but I swear I can't see a taunt skill listed anywhere. Do you just get the thing at level 16 where you generate extra threat from holy and spam aoe? I feel confused.
---
I was planning to try and prot through early dungeons while my mate healed and then transition to holy later but maybe that ideas terrible. Should I level warrior instead for that?
---
More proud of this guy and how he looks then any over my retail chars tbh
---
You know times are crazy when it's hard to differentiate real life from a cg render. Looks incredible!
---
There is no “play style”, get a grip it just sucks, it’s not a thing.
---
I prefer Horde likewise, as they acknowledge their messed up side and try to better themselves, alliance story comes off superegotistical save us screw you kinda mentality. Favorite race is troll though, the OG flesh race of azeroth.
---
That being said I've played both sides....and Horde is where the heart is. I dont really identify with any alliance specific characters. Most of the good ones are neutral(Tyrion).
---
Thanks for the laugh man, I needed it haha

---
I'm a priest so I always look for non cloth dps so they don't roll on my shit.
---
As a rogue, the scorpions in the Shimmering Flats are flat out disgusting. They give a 5 minute poison debuff that prevents you from bandaging and stealthing. And they use it frequently too. You could use anti poison but I ran out very quickly.
---
yeah it's clearly possible, but people seem to get pretty serious about zf farm these days so finding a spot is kinda tight. Also people really like the full cloth comps once they taste it ahah.
---
Nah, I'm still going to protec
---
Then they turn their pet taunt on because they are thinking this tank is horrible.
---
Thanks! Literally 9 months
---
this is the only one i'm missing how long had you been grinding for it?
---
Brilliant. A true artist!
---
They do, Blessing of Might updates the tooltip
---
Its VC!
---
i’m dying
---
I adventure into Goldshire Inn and ended up in bed with a Night Elf Rogue named “buzzums”
---
So paladins would be stuck in the era of normal bc while everyone else gets to pvp each other lol. Well I think the idea of my plan is good but there are holes
---
Learn when to use multi shot.  For me that's never and I have no issue staying at or near top dps
---
Btw OP [you imposter](https://i.imgur.com/IzBL09f.png)!  
---
u/Atlasbow
---
I Got 7 days and 10h rocking level 50. I level up my proffesions, dooing world pvp, exploding, questing etc. Even cleaving dungeons. 
---
What i find most booring is the aoe cleaving dungeons. So i dont dont that very often. 
---
Just play the game ad you find it fun. Screw the ppl who tells you how to play.
---
Amazing save. We need more heroes like you everywhere.
---
Spotted the hunter. But come on man u taking it too seriously
---
I dont think as many people understand as they should that most of the wow classic playerbase doesn't even consider playing retail an option, I don't even think of it as a game in my mind.
---
You must not have played Vanilla; otherwise you would know being rezzed on an elevator spawns you under the elevator and you immediately fall to your death again. So you would never accept that rez anyway unless you want added durability loss lol.
---
I see.. But will I have to relearn all of the skills? The question goes for both pet trainer and the pet itself
---
People are stupid. The language was clear. If it was not allowed it would have been stated. The GM literally just told you that there's nothing they can do if ywget scammed. I don't know how you are confused.
---
When it comes down to it in pve, no not really. They all do the same damage in the end. But in PvP it has a very aggressive cast knockback so it’s useful for that
---
&gt; there actually be something to do besides doing BGs against perfect characters all in Naxx BiS gear
---
Plz....level 19/29 twinking will never die!
---
Same! I almost cried every time I flew over the ruins. So glad to have pre-cata Azeroth back!
---
My wife left one of those in the bathroom trash bin. Needs repair as it's all red.
---
100% get first aid for self heals while soloing
---
1) If you're in full tank gear and prot specced in pvp, don't expect to get much done in the way of killing. You'll make an excellent flag carrier, and be nice for harassment with concussion blow. Getting gear for fury is more competitive because the majority of warriors are looking to gear this way.  
---
2) Herbalism is definitely nice to have as a rogue, but not required. Fadeleaf (blinding powder) and Swiftthistle (thistle tea) are the only two herbs you'll "need". Neither of which are extremely expensive.
---
&lt;Guys I’m Trying&gt;
---
Not an actual factual question, but also not worth making its own thread. Is it okay to grief opposing factions in PvE servers? I always grief undead/troll mages if they're aoe farming in the same area. Not sure how to treat opposing players in non-PvP.
---
Gotta fish with mind blast and pray
---
every pvp server is already 60+ horde. blizzard literally doesnt care lmfao
---
That’s what I’m sticking with rn. Gonna list the Insight Robes
---
I randomly passed a guy I played some 3v3 arenas with back in TBC on the road in Lakeshire. He remembered me after I messaged him and gave me the name of another former partner. It's been about 11-12 years with no contact at all.
---
&gt;Doubt it. Crit and parry values on bosses were both calculated incorrectly in the favor of warriors and rogues on private servers.
---
Re-read your own post first before you question someone's reading comprehension. You claimed rogue and warrior dps would be lower in classic because private servers had the wrong values.
---
That being said, fire mages vs fury warriors comes down to the tanks more than anything. If the tanks can somehow manage to generate enough threat to let fury go full bore then fury beats out fire. Otherwise fire wins that battle and the warrior gets to do the good ole fury feign (or warrior vanish if you prefer.)
---
Err... Yeah. They are considered the Eastern time zone servers.
---
There are no central time zone servers.
---
I never suggested otherwise?
---
I think that’ll just depend on the level requirement and/or if you get the drop haha
---
30secs i think
---
Or just pretend to be resto spec. With enough gear, gear doesn't matter.
---
Yea they didn’t make it anywhere in that dungeon I’m sure.
---
While you’re leveling they’re healing in shadow tree anyway probably. Dungeon goes faster when healer never has to drink bc spirit tap is OP
---
What do you mean by the 2 second mark?
---
No shit this is me! Glad the moo’s are appreciated.
---
Tell that to three mages and an Eye of Kilrogg, can't net a mage in Africa.
---
And when coming up an elevator in UC, the exit tunnels are always angled towards north.
---
Literally all internet moderators are jokes. You dont become an unpaid internet janitor by being a reasonable normal person.
---
Thanks for the tip I’m still just gonna run a full circle around the top level anyway.

#nerfshamans
---
Like the game being officially released in china.
---
Engineering is a useful but expensive profession that all classes can benefit from hugely. Mining and skinning ar good money-making professions, but for skinning in particular you won't notice much of a difference in your income until you start skinning heavy or thick leathers (level 38+). Blacksmithing is a great profession for warriors to have since they are heavily dependent on their gear, so making it themselves will give you an easier time if you don't neglect it. Mining will complement blacksmithing best, since you will be able to mine and smelt most of the ingredients you will be needing.
---
I honestly think this will help me more than Questie.
---
Engineering is by far the most useful at the end of the game, but one big advantage BS has for warriors is that you can get lots of useful stuff throughout the leveling process. And some of the end game stuff is very good as well so it's not like it's wasted.
---
What about people incorporating cone into their kit? They didn't cone directly in front of them, they cone about 45 degree and the camera thing really makes a difference
---
Oh that’s awesome!! I’m happy you saw this lol
---
Then you got players like me who will not let a red go by without fighting them. If you can’t defend yourself you are getting camped because I’m not fighting for tags. If you avoid pvp gtfo a pvp server and go carebear it up on a pve server.
---
yeah but that means that (most) mages get a guaranteed slot in the raid in the first place. Exactly how many Druids do you realistically think a raid needs.? I'll say 2 max if you have all the other needed classes. So there are a lot of Druids sitting on the sidelines. 
---
The combat rez is the skill a Druid brings to the table in a raid.
---
Then I wouldn't worry about it. Both are great at pvp. Play which ever is more fun to you. Farming shards for raids is terrible btw...
---
Lol my experience has been the exact opposite. everyone wants to group with me and I’ve made 4 or 5 e-friends already. Never happened in retail
---
Yeah, this is the magic of an MMO.  I don’t understand why retail caters so much to people who essentially just want a single player “game” (read:  checklist of daily chores).
---
Quests should just be a reason to journey out into the world.  The world and the other players are the real content in a good MMO.
---
I'm in a weird situation and was hoping someone could give me some advice.
---
I have a capped human warrior that's acquired some decent dungeon gear at this point, and I'm looking into what my alt will be. While searching, I've found that I actually prefer how night elves look in plate armor. Is it worth it to level a night elf warrior to eventually overtake my current main? If not warrior, I'd like to level another class as a night elf to maybe help out with farming since warriors are pretty limited in that regard OR as something to play when i want to switch up the playstyle of the warrior. I've tried a druid and made it to level 14 before I gave up, it's not for me. I'm mostly a warrior and shaman kind of player, but since I'm playing alliance I don't have access to shamans and druids have already been ruled out. Could anyone give me some advice or class suggestions based on all this?
---
I would disagree as i'm currently leveling as one (lvl 50 atm).  If you want to try prot pal, do it now. The gap between tanks only get bigger the higher level you are (well especially at lvl 60).
---
The only headache is taunting mobs back. Also as others pointed, it's not the best class to generate threat. But you can have a lot of fun still and do smooth dungeon runs. There are some very big milestones, like consecration, improved righteous fury and seal of wisdom.
---
Side tip : don't always use your abilities on cooldown. For example, i'll often use seal of righteousness without using judgement, because each attack generate extra threat and you don't have to drink between each pull. You will learn more about threat generation as you play, and will be better at managing your ressources and cooldowns.
---
Tanking at lowel levels is hard, for every class. Don't get discouraged and if you really get tired of it, you can simply respec (for 1g which may seem like alot but hey, you gotta enjoy the game!) Don't let others say "don't try this", imo.
---
Went for 1400 on mograine
---
There is not much reason for going full restoration as a Druid, as you will only ever use Healing Touch in raid groups.
---
Can you multi log characters tied to the same account?
---
Not bad at all. Actually easier because you can farm shads in them.
---
I got to lt general helping a friend to hwl. I pvp’d a lot back in classic
---
ive never ever played ally not even on private servers
---
Wait you're kidding right... Is this true??
---
I was really hoping to hear the charge or stealth sound into a stun after the slow mo victory walk lol
---
Welcome to the imperial system
---
Ye but why comment on classic then when retail has your drakes?
---
2 seconds left on the duration of the spell you'll probably need a mod to see that
---
Why interact with world when fly do same thing but faster. Retail bad.
---
But it's not just quest mobs. Even at 60, if you allow too many people on at the same time, it becomes chaos. Gathering professions especially would be fucked. 
---
And just generally a clusterfuck of people everywhere (hello 2000 horde who felt like camping blackrock mountain, or a boat).
---
When layers are gone capacity has to go down. Perhaps it will still be above vanilla caps, but if you literally let in 50k people or some absurd number it will be borderline, if not literally, unplayable.
---
Love decursing people
---
If you put attac before protec it woulda worked better too
---
IMHO, he turned out just fine.
---

are you sayng they're easily killed, or that you wanna smooch tank druids?
---
I would have never left another Troll hanging, a Tauren on the other hand...
---
Wow where can I see more of your work dude?
---
Wow, what a piece of shit you must be
---
Yeah I was at work and couldn't check my phone
---
not that reposts are bad cause  I missed this this first time around.  Its just sort of pathetic to pretend OP witnessed it when it didn't
---
No foolies, if you try to MC somone on the boat you will get a "target cannot be charmed" message.
---
Rogue excels at solo play. How else are you suppose to gank? The trick is to have pretty near-level weapons. Git gud.
---
You're over-rationalizing this way too much
---
I found a questing partner named Dumbeldore yesterday. My character's name is Loldemort. We're both undead mage.
---
Classic+ with edited Expansions. So something called Classic Expansions+
---
Ignoring expansions would be throwing too much good content out, but they can be improved.
---
**The priority is not to invalidate all progress made by people so far.** The expansions would instead increase level cap by 5 levels (or 10 but squish stats). Level 60 Dungeons and Raids would scale up for one expansions in order provide a challenge to the new highest level, it would still make them easier for the next max level than doing at the level they're meant to be. Legendary items would scale up for one expansion as well.
---
That means that all raids and legendaries have doubled life-span, and that everyone's investment into the game pays off if they transition to the next end-game content.
---
Other things are what everyone is suggesting, so basically improving the current content, and the expansions until community decides they don't want any more expansions (around WotLK most likely).
---
Tanks will ask if they want you to pull for them, which isn’t an unheard of thing.
---
It’s just kind of a dick move to me. Regardless of what the pace is. Not only does it affect the tank in initially generating threat it also affects the healer as well Bc now he right off the bat has to worry about you as well. 
---
Another thing to consider is while you’re sitting there thinking man, this tank is bad. He is thinking man I guess I can’t pull big because my opening small test pulls to gauge the group the dps can’t control their threat and are pulling extra mobs. So he never gets comfortable and never picks up the pace,
---
If I recall correctly it means spells with cast time of 3.5 seconds get +8 damage (and dots with like 15 sec or so) and it scales from there. A 3 sec cast spell is like 75% or something. That's for pre-talent cast time so if you reduce it with talents or skills it doesn't change the spell damage coefficient.
---
And it works for all spell types
---
It worked perfectly for me. Untrain engineering, relearn &amp; level it, go read Soothsaying for Dummies and get the specialization of your choice.
---
You can turn off error messages
---
&gt;It will be set to the local time of the server
---
The local time of the servers in Chicago is central time.  The in-game time of the servers is just displayed as eastern time zone.  Being considered something, and where they are actually located are two different things.  What you said is not correct.
---
No fking way
---
They became quite a monster in TBC yes.
---
So for maximum efficiency you don't need healers, but the most efficient groups did 10 man raids with two healers? Sure, makes perfect sense.
---
My experience in that cave was a full 10v10 brawl go players coming and going and each faction gaining and losing control of the lower caves. It was epic as fuck.
---
I temember Druids doing that, and spamming the insta-cast spell Moonfire.
---
This seems like a great time! What are your tricks ?
---
Why do some mobs break out of polymorph after just a second or two when nothing hits them and they don't have any allies that could remove the debuff?

Every druid laughing right now
---
I mean its why I play
---
Yeah, who the f are they to tell other people how to play, people that race to 60 doing dungeons aren't telling people to stop questing and do what they do.
---
I guess the reasoning was to find a balance race choices, and avoid having a world full of humans. Humans have access to 6 out of 8 playable classes, and all of them make sense. They had to cut something.
---
I agree. People are still only looking out for themselves. The only reason groups are forming is because there are too many people in an area killing the mobs for a quest. Had a couple times where I ask for an invite from another group and they just ignored me, then tried their hardest to tag everything in the area so I can't get a kill.
---
There was never another login noted after logging into battle.net. I changed my password just to be safe.
---
People like you are the problem with wow.
---
You don't know shit, yet you try so hard to be seen as some hard core "played since vanilla" douchebag, so much so that you'll try to min-max a game that's actually piss easy. And all to the detriment of anyone who doesn't feel exactly like you.
---
I dig it
---
Holy cow, thats so dumb.
---
Looks like a 1980s He-man action figure
---
I'd take you up on your offer but I'm horde on stalagg. Too bad too cause you are in my level range. My impression of you has successfully been adjusted. Two mages have a lot of cc so with good play that's gonna mitigate lots of the melee damage. Don't think you'd have the same success with two rogues and a paladin or whatever other healer.

No he is not. You would set up a guild/group that simply guys and sells gold for markup. You wouldn't facilitate transfers.
---
If someone says friendo I’d leave em too
---
that’s good. my character is a pacifist and incapable of killing other players. my only option when getting attacked is to sheep them and run away. that was ruined a bit back when blizzard nerfed it.
---
Don't see why not
---
2 is probably closer to thralls color.
---
I agree with those things, but those aren't min-maxing at the expense of someone else. The people who tell ret pally dps or druid tanks that they'll never find a guild to raid with and they should reroll are the problem. Let people play what they want, especially when a group cleared MC in under a week without even having full 60s, you can find a place in raids as almost any spec.

So I just installed it on the external drive and then attempted to boot WoW from my main PC (again I just copied the entire World of Warcraft folder, I did nothing else) and now it's saying I need to repair world of warcraft (on the main pc)?

Good for you, Chad. Meanwhile I have actual friends who I play with, so I don't really gotta worry about being chosen. But you do you, princess.

Have fun and fight with honor friend! For the horde!!

You know there are PvE servers right?
---
Oh my sweet baby Jesus do you need to be * technically* correct that badly?
---
I meant the local time *designated* for the *virtual game servers*, not the local time of the *physical servers.*
---
I thought that was obvious from context and didn't need to be explained, because there are no servers designated for central timezones. Apparently not, though.
---
Absolutely. Load times may slow down but WoW doesn’t install to other directories so it’s fine otherwise.
---
Define account. 
---
A battle.net account yes if you have multiple subscriptions.

A wow account under your battle.net account no.

---
The funny thing is those people you are talking about are more than likely retail players here because of hype. They are acting that way because they are so accustomed to not having to interact with other players or the fact that they will continue seeing the same people for the ENTIRETY of the game. I'm sorry you are having a bad time :(
---
Feline swiftness is still useful even after you get TF. It increases your stealth speed outdoors, and helps you chase down runners outdoors.
---
I roll an owl with screech. My pet is basically the trash tank a lot of times. Tank holds the boss or focus target, and my pets got some threat on whatever the tank can't hold with tab sunders or shouts/tc. 
---
Honestly good hunters should be working with the tank to manage the run and make it smooth. Between trapping, pulling, fd, kiting, pet stun, pet taunt, the hunter should be doing a lot of the work in the dungeon to make things smooth.
---
Sure, you can do what you want in a MMORPG really. If your guy is someone who does that, and the game allows it, I don't see it being a no-no.
---
If this is legit im going to consider quitting. Locks being unable to release infernals on lowbies and doomguards not aggroing onto guards was just a bug i thought, but if they are purposefully removing the griefing that was in vanilla i have 0 deaire to continue playing.
---
Wot
---
He has 6 great reasons , but a list of 6 is arbitrary? Alch urself
---
You can get the same ability with the goggles helm that drops from King Mechagon. I use them on my priest to zoom in constantly and check for rares so I don't have to mount up or go in caves to check myself.
---
Have you tried a rogue? It’s the only other melee option if that’s your thing.
---
Gonna be honest, the comic isn’t great but the way the last frame is drawn is making me laugh
---
Same thing happened with me I randomly ran into an old GM that I played with during TBC. After all the different servers and layers and I happen to run into him after like 12 years in duskwood, crazy
---
Literally no one has ever said classic was hard or hardcore rofl
---
It’s not quicker than a proper solo run, due to bugged increased xp for dungeon groups though it levels you quicker than it normally would.
---
The most unrealistic part of this is the fact that you spent 40 minutes. Shit woulda taken at least 2 hours.
---
Everyday!  This is posted every day!
---
Same way warriors were dealing with aoe threat generation before. DPS discipline focusing one target, taunts to save DPS when they can't defend themselves/do something stupid.
---
Tanking isn't easy because the DPS are supposed to be doing their job of threat mitigation. It's not entirely brainless to be a DPS if you want your tank to have sanity left.
---
But nothing can really hold aggro off mage aoe. They just have to use their cold CC to deal with that.
---
If ya can't cuddle with your bro who can you cuddle with ya know?

Dude please explain lol

Guild name checks out surprise
---
Farming dungeon loot for leveling is the weirdest meta I've heard of. Anything lower than ST is not worth farming.
---
I just hit 60 last night and the only dungeon I farmed was BRD and that was only because it has end game gear for raiding.
---
Its a laid back point and click browser game, raids are too much of a co-op multihour investment that is known for WoW and such, I would never feel like investing that much effort to Runescape. It alwayswas to me such an lighthearted game, but not with tryhard raids.

Questie hands down the most useful for me so far..

I think Tauren can do 50 mins

What do you mean, that's a winning combination lmao /s
---
I disagree:
---
&gt; Most healers don't even heal during dungeons. You just plow through them anyways.
---
is not the same as:
---
&gt; Healers don't even heal dungeons.
---
If you're going to quote, quote. There's subtle differences that context brings out. However, I was incorrect in which quote I was referencing from his original spat at me today - I thought he was referencing several posts later because he brought up the stockades and incorrectly assumed it was my sole evidence to my developed thought. So good on you for pointing me to where he was pulling from the original quote.
---
&gt; Print screened that comment as well, will upload if you decide to edit/remove that comment.
---
Lol, I have integrity. You need not worry. Glad you have the proof to back me up if reddit servers blow up.
---
&gt; And you don't seem to be a nice party member. "No way I'm going oom several times just to give the healer some water". What kind of bullshit attitude is that?
---
Just cherry picking my comments to develop a fantasy that is untrue about me isn't a fair representation. I also said:
---
&gt; For the record, I gave each of those healers whatever was left of my stack of water and made myself some more.
---
and 
---
&gt;  I gave the healer (a druid) 80 water.
---
So to attribute me to being the "not nice" party member because of a comment made thinking about *group efficiency* is farfetched at best. I stand by my comment:
---
&gt; No way I'm going OOM several times just to give my healer some water they don't even need.
---
FYI, I respect your memory in attempting to quote me. You almost got it correct, at least the intent was fully correct. Full points.
---
Maybe, just MAYBE, you're perception of me is wrong. Wanna chat to find out more? Are you done attacking my integrity - can we talk about the actual content of the discussion now?
---
&gt; You claimed rogue and warrior dps would be lower in classic because private servers had the wrong values.
---
And what exactly is wrong about this? Boss parry was lower on private servers than it is classic. Therefore, warrior and rogue damage will be lower on classic than it was on private servers. One plus one equals two. I shouldn't have to explain this.
---
&gt; If the tanks can somehow manage to generate enough threat to let fury go full bore then fury beats out fire. Otherwise fire wins that battle and the warrior gets to do the good ole fury feign (or warrior vanish if you prefer.)
---
Threat management is literally a core part of the dps equation. Warlocks would be the top DPS if searing pain + conflag build didn't generate obscene amounts of aggro.
---
&gt; Steam has gone from about 15 million accounts to 65 million in that time period.
---
And WoW has gone from over 10m to just 1m?  It's pretty clear market saturation wasn't the reason wow started declining.
---
LoLs peak concurrent daily players was a good indication at just how many people will no life an engaging game.  The average revenue per player excluding whales was also enough that subscription isn't a big differentiator either.
---
WoW BGs are where a lot of people first got a taste for objective maps with fantasy rpg elements.

I had a friend who went by "Dragul" on Lightninghoof in Vanilla. Undead Rogue. I was a lowly troll Rogue... god I forget his first name. Talonblade I think. But he helped me level and even gave me money for my first mount at level 40. It was truly awesome. I forget what happened but sometime around BC he stopped playing and I did not see him on after that. Miss that dude, he was pretty cool. I was very young and he showed me the ropes.
---
I think a lot of the mentality from retail is still present even amongst a large portion of classic players. A lot of people probably see classic as a side gig or extra content since retail is in a lul or maybe they’re getting a bit burnt out ( I don’t know what’s going on in retail this is just speculation) or maybe they just want to see what this classic thing is all about. A lot of people are in the mind set that endgame is 99% of the game and leveling is just a means to an end because that’s what we’ve been trained to do going back as far as Cata ( maybe even wrath or BC). 
---
But for a lot of us that don’t play retail or remember what Vanilla was, or maybe even remember hearing about Vanilla things from friends either irl or in game want to enjoy a game again. 
---
Retail ( mind you I haven’t played since Legion) is designed around max level because it’s never going to take a person 1 month to get to max level, and what you do between level (100 whatever) and (100 whatever + 10) is basically irrelevant to what you actually do in that xpac. 
---
Classic is much more about the journey, and I just don’t think the general masses are in tune with that kind of game anymore...

This is somewhat close to reality, as ancient maps IRL weren't often concerned with accurate scale (unless they were navigation charts)
---
Not at my computer so cant recall what its called...  weak auras maybe? Might have to do some legwork and find one
---
That leaves what ? rogue , priest and hunters?
---
out of the 3 the easiest to farm with would be hunter and the play style is completely the opposite of warrior
