How can it even work as a loot system if everyone always has more DKP than they can spend?
---
---
---
A great healer also does damage!
---
Do you have an example quest?
---
.,*.
---
Well some classes don't generation as much of their damage from crits. Hurts ruin locks, frost mages (depending of its a flat -3% or say -10% of added aura crit), Bal druid (rofl) more than most other classes. To a lesser degree rogues (even less), hunter, and warriors.
---

---
The armor changes help rogues, warriors, hunters, and tanks thus increasing their class comparison dps. Then with the duel wield differences warriors and rogues (less so) lose some dps and thus some class comparison dps. We do't know how this will pan out, but from this Ruin locks, frost mages losing at least some ground in class comparison dps. Rogues will probably be the overall winner. Its hard to say what the effect will be for hunters and warriors verses say a fire mage.
---
I agree with you, PvP realms do seem more fun! Apart from the periodical frustrating moments you get ganked, it seems much more better. Lorewise it makes more sense and I reckon it makes exploring enemy areas much more interesting, and those group world pvp fights do sound quite fun.  
---
One thing I've hated about MMOs is having more than one character, I never liked leveling more that once, so I'll have to decide either one or the other.  
---
You're married and have kids?? Holy shit. It's even more awesome that you're going to play Classic with them! Here I am a random 19 year old that has never even bought a retail WoW subscription.
---
I loved that monitor but kept thinking about the ultra wide. Gonna see how that performs. I may not keep the 25” lmao
---
Feels good to be back lol
---
Sounds awesome! :D
---
Warlocks are so unbelievably overpowered in PVP 1v1, especially in the later content patches.
---
I have almost always mained a mage though, so maybe that's why I hate em.
---
To be fair, I never actually paid attention to the lore, but I did like the few lore characters you met like nathanos, saurfang, cairne, etc.
---
I bet it is! Or \~39 if it's raids.
---
Who is the dragon in the middle of your wallpaper?
---
Nice, don't cc, what a great fucking strategy.
---
Well, there is the problem that newcomers come in, and they're basically so far down that they'll never get the top tier items.
---
That's what I'm hoping, anything less would be too little imo.
---
The funny thing about hunters and druids though, is I always expected them to be bad and when I ran with a good one I was always blown away at how good they were. Crazy high skill ceilings on those classes.
---
[removed]
---
Definitely. I've never played with a really good druid in Classic, but I've played with a god of a hunter. Always exciting to watch them play.
---
Don't talk to me or my Peacekeeper Gauntlets ever again.
---
yeah cause saying difficult content in that game is harder than something in this game is a big nono
---
You can level 2h fury to 40 then arms to 60. As long as you have a 1h and shield you never need to spec prot unless you are in a 40 man raid.
---
The boss dies to fast for either of them to matter.
---
Depends how much you wanna RP with little boys...
---
Which is why you listed them, and added corrections.... Ohh wait, you didn't, which means you have no rebuttal.
---
I agree. Even on high pop pservers, great druid players are rare. I speak from a pvp perspective. Most of my game play on pservers was as a druid. I focused mostly on pvp. I spent most of my time in open world and specialized in killing mage and rogues.
---
Even with 10-12k peak players, I'd still get into arguments with mage and rogue players over how well druid could do against them. They INSISTED, to the point of anger in their arguments, that they had no issues killing druids. Twice, this came down to dueling them. I crushed them repeatedly. One mage even left our guild over this. His epeen could not handle it.
---
I consider myself a "good" druid player because I didn't raid enough to be hyper competitive. I plan on changing this in Classic. Great druid players will shatter most other player's expectations. They are the unicorns on each server. It amazes me how a server that's out for a year or more can have players who never run into a well played druid. This even occurs in tanking where druid players boast of their tanking skills and I sit back pondering why they never leave bear form between pulls, can't manage pickups or use their mana to assist healing top ups between fights while healers drink.
---
You're right. Mitigate would be a better word than prevent. Pure +1 would fare a little better than soft res because at least with +1 they give up their "main upgrade" rolling for someone else, but they still have better odds of grabbing bis items by colluding.
---
To actually prevent it you'd need an addon to track everyone's gear and alert you when someone is rolling for an item it's seen them with before.
---
I'd really like loot trading to at least be a toggle in raids so we wouldn't have to deal with this if we don't want to.
---
It's ridiculous how downvoted this is lol. Actual dimwits just read the first reply and followed the hivemind
---
Assuming they don't figure out that they've been fucked the whole time, while the "hardcore" guild have been playing ez mode, and using world buff cheats to make it even easier.
---
I was in chromatic dawn! Bonechewer was such a great server. I remember Kold, evilfox, Fabolous, Biffins, darkmech. A friend once whispered darkmech (out of the blue) to ask if he'd come on a brd stealth run. He must have been bored because he said yes. He basically tanked and healed the whole thing by himself in all his T3. His rejuv was ticking for more than double my scrubby druid.
---
It's the warning value, you wait till they are at 10% then pop a shield because it would be a waste of time to cast res after the pull. 
---
Then the renew is like "I know you have low hp, i Just don't care"
---
The point is that if they don't care about optimizing raid composition does it matter if their recruiting pool differs from a hardcore guild? They're also going to be drawing from the pool of players who fail to get into a hardcore raiding guild for any number of other reasons too, such as odddball specs of potentially optimal classes or just plain not very good at the game.
---
Unless its such a cluster-fuck of a fight that you don't even notice them.
---
Downranking is strictly a trick for squeezing out more mana efficiency with endgame level +healing, or *maybe* for saving a tiny bit of mana if you want to top someone up without overhealing, or *maybe* for shaving a fraction of a second off cast time if you are such an improbably skilled player that you can judge that fraction of a second in a fraction of a second.
---
All of these are fairly marginal benefits that only matter in close fights.
---
Otherwise you will be fine just "cast-cancelling" your biggest heal until it is needed. (Pre-cast the heal before they need it, then cancel it before you finish the cast by jumping, moving or hitting Escape if they do not need it. Repeat.)
---
When it is needed, IIRC for priests you only needed Rank 4 GHeal and max rank, because Rank 4 was the peak of mana-effiency, so you had your efficient heal and your big heal.
---
In practice there was sometimes wankery with heal-sniping in raids, where people competed to look good on the healing meter by healing other people's targets with fast heals before a big, efficient heal from the designated healer could land. Fast heals are good for that. But that's one reason healing meters are a dangerous tool in the hands of semi-informed raiders.
---
Not everyone has to judge their experience by comparing it to the experiences of others
---
By all historic census data and private server census data, yes, there will be 3 to 5 times more Warriors than Druids and 2-3 times more Rogues than Druids.
---
Yet, everyone does.... It's human nature.
---
Hey man. I noticed you've been nursing this post hard as fuck and I was going to call you out on how territorial you're being about it, but then you went and said this extremely honest thing, and I can totally get behind that.  
---
It's like telling someone they're not going to tank on their paladin in a raid even though they think they're going to be that guy as long as they work hard and play smart. You just kind of do it to fuck with them.
---
It also allows (name of ability I've forgotten) from kitty druids.
---
But this is good trick in general.
---
The best wow pvper i knew rolled druid right before bc, his 3rd toon. He was an absolute monster in arenas, i forget his rank avg but i remember it being consistently high. He always said he would have never been that good if druid wasnt his 3rd, and he thought playing them as a first toon was a mistake on many people's parts. As a class played well, they require true game knowledge.
---
yeah, I don't understand why a person would stay in a "casual guild" if they actually wanted to do as well as the hardcore guilds.
---
Fun police!  On your marks..
---
Nah, the way other people choose to have their fun in no way affects how I choose to have my fun, haha.
---
I don't think the ids are chronological
---
Bullshit.... They don't have the luxury to care.  They aren't given the choice.
---
The bulk of warriors comes from raiding as dps. Dreams of tanking are shattered once many players realize only a few primary tanks are required and they are typically taken by guild leaders. DPS warrior demand alone pads their numbers while hunter and druid players reroll at 60 because they aren't competitive enough or understand the role that is required of them in raids.
---
The ONLY fight that might would give people pause is 4HM, which most any guild that is truly “casual” wont ever see. Everything else, you just need your primary tanks and maybe a few others to throw on a shield (or go bear) and press taunt.
---
I've always felt like a female adventurer achieving stuff  was slightly more badass. Currently working on my own comics and the main character is a girl. Same for classic
---
Sure, but that still gives the Warrior a viable spec and raid spot in every raid.
---
This is totally how I always felt about warriors. I've always been a mage guy and absolutely love the utility.
---
This time, I'm rolling warrior. None of the ~10 people I'm gonna be playing with come launch want to play one (including a best friend who *always* was our tank back in the day). Figured I'd take the responsibility on myself to be the main tank of our guild.
---
That's really the only reason. I will never have to wait for a group to run a dungeon or elite quest. 
---
Although I'm sure there will be a ton of warriors at launch, at least I have my clique and I can be the center of attention and necessity to every group we do.
---
Shit, when WoW came out, I barely had a cell phone, and would forget to charge it for days. I was unreachable.
---
Nah, June is over.
---
Red alert was a beast in the rpg industry though. Until EA got their claws into it.
---
Also gonna get a remake though!
---
Troll post
---
Yeah rank 1 flash is dumb imo, even with blessing of light (which he didn't mention, but I'm assuming he meant because rank 1 anything without BoL is absurdly low healing).
---
Rank 3 holy light is where it's at. I'm not sure what the proportion is, but it gets most of that 400+ healing from max rank Blessing of Light.
---
You give people far too much credit lol
---
How many cloth is one turn in and hoe much rep?
---
Yeah, I'm interested to see what MC will be like with 1.12 itemization where pre-BIS is, in many instances, better than what dropped in MC.
---
Don't listen to this. Fury/Prot spec is a thing, but it's usually a thing in hardcore guilds where they already outgear the content
---
Watch Skarm Tank on YouTube he tanks in Fury in full T3 with a Thunderfury and he take ludicrous amounts of damage for a Tank. His healers are geared to keep him alive and he's in the best gear he can get.
---
You will NOT be Fury/Prot tanking while you're gearing up in BWL/AQ etc.
---
yeah that's the one application that's made sense so far, think I might see about finding a macro for that.
---
I never used one of those, how does that work if you want to preemptively big heal?
---
It's a 14% chance in Classic, not 17%.
---
Meeee
---
Alliance Warlock - Cirkimo
---
Horde Priest- Glinch
---
Also some resto druid I mained quite a bit but cant remember the name or even faction but pretty sure I was on Emerald Dream at that point
---
Great server, until it died in MoP. I still miss Fold the mage milking taurens in trade chat
---
Hunters. 
---
90% of the Hunters I've met in classic are either mentally retarded, Chinese gold farmers, or both.
---
Can usually look items up on wowpedia to accurately see when it was added or changed.
---
Druid okay at all, master of fuck all.
---
From TBC to early cata. Fond memories of hunting down Sleeve and Pantleg, and of course Sandisk.
---
Except most of those female streamers aren’t really gamers, just thotts doing softcore. Now before I get shit on, I’m not saying that all female streamers fall into that category, but certainly a large number of them do, which is unfortunate because that just gives the genuine gamer ones a bad name
---
"If you don't already have a guild or friends expect crickets"
---
No, the exact opposite of this. If you're tanking groups and you're unguided, expect a flood of whispers and guild invites.
---
You mean other than the quest you get from it?
---
For dungeons and that's about it .
---
It’s probably because he said he was married and pregnant
---
I think most guilds will be able to scrounge up a tank or two and some people that can use healing abilities.
---
"if im going to stare at an ass all day, it might as well be a good ass" - when i asked a dude why he always played female characters. I've never looked back
---
The cloth quartermasters were implemented in the Beta. In Darnassus, Raedon Duskstriker in the Tailor tree in Craftsmen’s Terrace accepts A Donation of Wool (60 Wool Cloth) and A Donation of Silk (60 Silk Cloth) each for a one time rep reward of 150 Darnassus rep (165 if human). I never tried turning in A Donation of Mageweave (level 40) and wasn’t high enough level for A Donation of Runecloth.
---
No, I mean the keg is literally empty.
---
thanks for the list, bummer that Breezecloud Bracers and Opaline Medallion are alliance only
---
I've been told that focus does not work in classic.
---
 If I remember correctly swipe for bears is a cone and only effect the 3 closest mobs.
---
JAB :D
---
First thing I do after every new install. Absolutely first thing. Even before I open it to download a different browser... I'll find it from the start menu, just get it out of my sight.
---
I'd rank it
---
Druid -&gt; Priest -&gt; Paladin
---
Never played horde so can't speak to shaman.
---
It doesn't much matter if you understand the possible applications, I'm just trying to keep you from spreading misinformation.
---
I bought the wow cookbook and have been making my lunches for the week using it. I actually really enjoy it and the recipes arent hard to follow
---
-0,5s manaburn still better than -4% mana on instants
---
Wait wait wait. Don't druid kitties need agi?
---
Stop trying to bring skin color into this, because you and I both know you’re just race baiting. Now that we have that load of horse shit out of the way... you provide value in today’s society in one of two ways: you build something (own a business) or you help someone build something (being employed). One involves taking a huge risk for a chance at a huge payout (ownership) and the other involves sacrificing that chance of a huge payout for stability in pay (being employed). No one is forcing anyone to avoid the risk of ownership, so comparing willful employment to slavery is disingenuous and downright insulting to anyone who goes to their job everyday to make ends meet... they’re more than welcome to take on some risk and start their own business at any time, but most just opt not to. I fall into the “wage slave” category, but I’m not delusional enough to think that I can’t leave at any time for a different job (slaves can’t), or start my own business (slaves can’t).
---
So... why did *you* assume I was referring to a particular group of people based on their skin color? I was talking about having a job vs not having a job.
---
It kind of does tho. Imagine playing wow alone.
---
Not worth it. 
---
1) You make sure to deliver cloth for rep in Darnassus.  
---
2) You get the much cooler wintersaber mount from Winterspring (unarmoured).
---
\&gt; So I concede the point. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Reported, that violates Reddit's ToS.
---
If you can't survive half a pull as a druid with pre hots on you, then you are in dire need of some gear upgrades.
---
Oh. You’re trolling. Gotcha.
---
This is the reality of it.  No one will have 6 shamans. 4 maybe and whatever else they can find.
---
A couple of UX comments if you don't mind:
---
1. **Bigger Hit Targets**  
---
Have the hit targets for the + and - buttons be a bit larger, its easy to tap-tap-tap and only get 1 or 2 points
---
2. **Skill to Skill**  
---
If I'm in Skill A and it's description is open, when I tap Skill B, close A and open B in a single action. Small thing, but it'll make the flow from skill to skill feel much more natural. You can't ALWAYS do this of course, some skills are covered. Just saying when someone DOES do it, make it happen, it'll feel much better.
---
This is P-server bullshit.
---
Real wow the mobs are smart enough to flee towards help.
---
No....  The govt creates the money.   There is a sort of a reciprocal effect with taxes, but it's not where the govt gets the money.
---
I agree. It is often not wise to have the tank drag their aggro's mobs all over the place. A hunter can use their pet to peel the mob or a cc can be used from another in the group.
---
If the main tank immediately tries to pick up the mob, they often will ruin these other attempts of peeling/cc'ing the mob. That, and players need to learn not to pull aggro.
---
Well, that's your opinion and not one I share.
---
I played LOTRO when I was younger, quit when it went p2w.
---
I played a pserver to level 10, "Yeah this is pretty fun like old LOTRO."
---
Just been waiting ever since. Don't want to play an obviously inferior product that will spoil me for the real thing.
---
It's secondary. In both bear and cat form, druids get attack power from Strength. It's 2 AP for 1 point of strength. You do get 1 AP per point of agility and a tee-tiny bit of added crit chance, but strength is 100% always the priority stat. I believe that changed in TBC when agility became the main stat just to make itemization easier for rogues and cat druids.
---
That looks like a test item that was never available to players. The name is most likely referring to Tom Chilton. There are a few other items like that.
---
Druid. I've tried so many times to play one, and I just don't like their specific combination of things. Being a bear is super cool, but their abilities just don't click for me.
---
I also prefer to see my character's appearance, even if its janky looking.
---
So many people are saying Shaman. I love support characters so I actually find Shaman really engaging due to its flexibility and how comparatively active of a playstyle it can have compared to other support Classes
---
If there is too much people (It would mean sharding is 100% useless) I'll probably explore to get some xp
---
I know you meant to type RTS, but I would have loved a command and conquer themed rpg...
---
In early vanilla there was no attunement
---
I recall it being noticeably faster (which is sure, unreliable), i sort of feel this may have been a complicated issue since shoot and "auto-shoot" were both a thing at separate times of vanilla. - this could either of been a quirk of the non auto-cast version of the "spell" and PS ported it over directly as such, or something else on how it wasn't particularly a tested thing. - we may need to submit a bug report on classic-live, and force the devs to double check on their hardware.
---
Nelf/Cow as always by a large margin.
---
People always assume this means there was a problem... dude has been doing this a long time, probably legit wanted to move on.
---
Yes I did mean rts. Oops.
---
CnC Renegade was a ton of fun as well though. But that's fps. But the only non-rts in the series that isn't a ducking mobile game.
---
I'm pretty sure that's not right. It's been many years, but I believe the first few times I went there we went through BRD and there was not the core attunement that allowed the portal.
---
Patch 1.3 seems to be when they added the window. Patch 1.5 seems to be when they added the Riftwalker NPC.
---
How'd you get into pservers, though? That seems like such a niche thing for someone who comes from a different game.
---
Still remember in early vanilla a resto druid need rolled on felstriker against a rogue who was losing his shit because it dropped, since he assumed the proc would work in cat form. Needless to say it doesn't, and needless to say, it sparked a lot of drama. The thread created over it ended up getting capped. 
---
Ah, dramawing... I miss you.
---
That won't work for me because I'm deaf
---
Paladin. Never could get into them.
---
Why pservers, though? Longed for a more TBC-like experience or what was the impulse?

In TBC paladin was my favorite class.

But in Vanilla.. yea not so much.

Right winger talks about "basic economics".... This should be good.    Let me guess, herp derp inflation.
---
Yeah, I'm glad it might help you :) The only downside is a bit of ping and if i ever decide to raid in the evenings it'd be an issue. But hopefully it works out!
---
I guess for me it's not just priest, but healing in general. I cannot play a healer. I don't like watching health bars. I don't like missing a heal by .25 seconds and someone dies, then we wipe thanks to me. I'll stick to my DPS.

Thanks, that makes perfect sense!!
---
To be fair, nobodies opinions mean anything here atm.
---
Blizzard will use analytics to determine the direction of Classic after time and some measurement of success is known. The audience each server has compared with the easy path of putting out TBC will determine this.
---
1.12 Classic, when viewed as a stand alone product, has a limited life cycle per server. This is fact and clearly revealed historically on both real and private servers. It's up to Blizzard to determine if interest in Classic is enough to take it on it's own continued journey.
---
The hardliner positions we've heard a thousand times that are about to be spammed on this thread mean absolutely nothing pre-launch.
---
Here here
---
In TBC all content up to Maru in SWP was puggable. It helped it was the official Aus server so you could get groups 24 hours a day.
---
Does it make sense to just run there and deal with 1 to 10 without skill trainers? As far as I know pally is mostly white damage anyway for the first X levels.
---
Yeah, the druid could nuke until OOM and then DPS in cat form.
---
It’s the same run you’d have to make to get there
---
Lol, what does this have to do with classic wow aside from the word dwarf?
---
Goblin jumper cables are essential if you are going warlock. If you go MD/Ruin you can sacrifice your succi, then raise her again for a decent boost to dps.
---
1.6 was memorizing spray patterns too. It was just more of a "laser tag" than a "shooter".  I dont mean that in a bad way. It was more like a vehicle for competition, you headshot me with a Glock? I got dinked. You headshot me with an AK? GG mic muted. Didnt matter how realistic it was, you knew the rules the arena operated on and participated against our team in said arena, that arena being 1.6
---
It’s not a huge deal necessarily, I did it as a mage with no trainer. It just takes a good 20-30 minutes to get back if you decide to go train up. 
---
It mainly depends if those first levels with them are that important to you, or if you want Darnassus rep for the mount.
---
I... have no comment
---
Don't know if anyone's mentioned it yet but Mirah's Song [https://classicdb.ch/?item=15806](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15806)   from the Quest:  Kirtonos the Herald is Pre-raid BiS OH for Combat Sword Rogues, which is most likely going to be at least half if not more of the rogues in raids, simply because it is super easy and requires no debuff slots to work.
---
Hey, thanks for the offer. Send me a message once it releases and I'll consider that, might make easing into the grouping up easier for me if I have some understanding help along the way.
---
Least to most in order: Mulgore, Teledrassil, Dun Murogh, Durotar, Tirisfal, Elewynn.
---
Then its no problem right kyle?
---
Doesn't that just lead to the entrance to BRD?
---
Very little if I'm honest but hey, I'm alliance in the streets and horde in the sheets baby!! 😂 
---
(the really real answer is that it's Saturday night, I'm terribly inebriated and I'm killing time in the back of a long taxi ride home) *Kings honour friend*
---
They play the same regardless of spec while leveling.  Pull with Lightning bolt into totems,  cast flame shock, lightning shield, and melee down. 
---
Enhance is considered the best.
---
thats the tunnel to the right im talking about to the left in the little cubby
---
I do too, just a joke I'm copying from another thread...
---
- every healer ever ^_^
---
I'd immediately challenge a Klingon, then bed his woman after slaying him!
---
How do I get in on this?!?
---
Warlocks have infinite mana. Mages have evocation + mana gems.
---
It's lvl 53 and yes only dal rend or unique BoEs replace it before MC
---
It's gonna highly depends on your region. US, probably pretty packed. EU, probably somewhat normal. Asia, scarce-normal.
---
"You come get the juju!"
---
Can't wait to see this list come into fruition, I am extremely impressed! I will be rolling a shockadin for classic as my main, and holy/disc priest as an alt!
---
Yeah it's definitely the most fun toolkit and playstyle of any class imo
---
Back in the day I used to fake sick, and the feeling of accomplishment that came over me at a young age was insane. Now, I have different days off from my fiancé which helps. I have release off and 3 days off after. I’m going to have no life.... and that makes me happy

You can kiss all this civility goodbye soon *for the alliance!*
---
&gt; be able to recraft goblin items as they break (they have a chance to explode on use)
---
No.
---
Sure just rename classic launcher to vanilla and enjoy.
---
I'm considering this as well.  Mostly into holy then some into shadow.  I feel like it would be pretty decent as far as PvP as well.  A drop in damage reduction and damage but then you get heals and decent damage without having to worry about toggling shadow form.
---
Thx for the explanation. Would it be smart to say use evocation (or it's equivelants) since they have a long cooldown first before something like runes/gems , that way you can use it again later? Or should you use the gems/runes since you can use it then make another one during the fight?
---
Uh, what?  Yes they do.
---
I leveled one in vanilla just to solo sm cath in single pulls. Which got old really really fast.
---
They can be used by Gnomish engineers...

You would walk there. It would take a long time.

Absolutely! Zepplin from Orgrimmar. Easy.

Run to zeppelin, jump off near starting area, Rez at healer.

Wear gunnars to

I remember leveling in Fel wood way back in vanilla... I popped a fel stone and it fucking crit and one shot me lmao
---
Not a fan of this idea i really want vanilla to stay vanilla i am not opposed if they eventually launched BC servers and people could transfer off of the classic servers to BC if they want.
---
No, they do not. Some of them have a chance to fail and damage you, but the item does not need replacing, ever.
---
I raided classic with a Warlock main from MC all the way through NAXX, i was a top 3 DPS for my guild and depending on the boss i could lead the meter. 
---
You have to sacrifice your succubus, and then raise it again either with goblin jumper cables or having a good priest in your party. They can raise the succy if they are fast enough. 
---
MD/Ruin all the way, you do not Shadowbolt spam. Not only do you have to hit your main target, you have to also keep curse of doom up on the alternate target if available, etc. 
---
You open up , curse main, curse doom off target(if there), corruption off target, shadowbolt,  corruption main(i think), lifetap, lifetap, deathcoil, corruption main, etc.
---
You need to be deathcoiling every 2 minutes, and there are other spells you want in the rotation. Along with hitting your trinkets etc.
---
This is the answer you're looking for OP
---
As much as I don't want to miss out on Phase 2 pvp on PvP servers, I think for long term I'll probably just be going PvE to not have to deal with open world pvp... I'll still BG the fuck out of the game since pvp is so much fun, I just don't want to deal with the headaches that can come of PvP servers.
---
The explosions deal damage, they do not break the item. Again, provide proof or go back to your shitty website.
---
What you're interested in is called tri-spec. You put 21 into shadow and split the rest in disc and holy. It's usually something like 17/11/21+2, and it's probably the best priest PvP spec. It's useless for raiding, though.
---
Druid for sure and its not close. Paladin and Shaman dps is laughable even when specced for it and priest would go oom quickly.
---
Raptors look great on Tauren
---
You can't be burned out on something that isn't there, LOL. They are burned out at their own lack of self-control
---
Kinda pointless 2 play 2 priests though unless you're just going with way different specs and trying to save on respec costs
---
PvP cause Red=Dead 😀
---
Soul Harvester is pre-raid bis though
---
Artifacts are not Legendaries.
---
Ah so you don't know. All gear from MC is not available in phase 1.
---
the spreadsheets to make it work are a bitch to set up
---
Just make an undead alt at some point
---
besides the hunter bow and anathema what else isn't? what isn't that would pertain to rogue?
---
Don't underestimate how much better players have become and how the dungeons are easier compared to private servers.
---
I two manned dungeons up to SM (I think even RD) as a Resto Shaman and an Arms Warrior. This was during Vanilla. 
---
I could even solo this Patchwork like boss in RD and Herod on a Feral druid during beta.
---
I think as long as you don't die your added damage from using a two handed weapon should in most cases outweigh the potentially higher mana usage. 
---
If you are playing with a random healer and without a voice com be safe though and use a shield.
---
"They dont hurt you when they explode, but they knock you down for 1 sec.
---
Breaks all the time. Gone through 4 pairs, pair1(6 uses), pair2(2 uses), pair3(1use) and pair4(broke on first try). Completely worthless."
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7189/goblin-rocket-boots#comments
---
bc comes next
---
Lol
---
Does anyone have a copy of that spreadsheet for loot priority by class?
---
[Classic List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1738440837) I think this used to be it but its changed to be more of a Bis list instead.
---
The reason I bring it up is it was a good resource for raid leaders for loot distribution.
---
Fights are not long enough to evocate twice from experience. Really just not neccesary.
---
Oh so that was recently 😃
---
That makes sense
---
Congrats, you found one item no one cares about because there's a better alternative.
---
Nah, they stop rotting after they get raised, all the rotting was done post-death, pre-undeath, otherwise all of the Forsaken would just be skeletons by now.
---
well i played pve server , there is a decent chance i get tired of world pvp a few months in if my faction is the minority on the server but i can always enjoy the experience then transfer if i need to
---
you may not be able to transfer to a pvp server but they will let people tramsfer off
---
thanks for the clarification, its still 9% above what scarm has had to work with the past 12 years
---
Afaik they haven't yet decided on that. And it cost money.
---
I like to lead the DPS meter, which is why I am going gnome warlock.
---
It's a 60 second craft time per sapper though. If I was that one person on the server with Goblin I would be charging big time fees
---
"Does he look like a gnome?"
---
Again, congrats on discovering the one item no one cares about because there's a better alternative. Do try again on coming up with a reason on why Goblin Engineering is necessary.
---
Thanks.  Also 5min cd is better than 30min cd so there's that.
---
Fair enough, you make a good point there. Maybe not include the leveling guide unless he’s about to give up because he can’t figure out where to quest(been through that frustration lol) but I can’t argue, some of the best times I’ve had in wow were getting lost and just exploring and meeting people and ganking/getting ganked while questing. You can’t take that from him I s’pose, maybe leave out Joanas.
---
If you are really from Universe B then you would be aware that most people are just hitting 60 or getting close to 60.
---
you may not be able to transfer to pvp but you will be able to transfer off
---
i know i want to experience pvp but yeah its possible only 10% of the server is my faction and i can see that being not fun
---
\&gt; Just wanted to start a discussion
---
This discussion is started at least once a day.
---
Not 1-shotting 20 Mobs but crying because I'ma stupid ass warrior losing against 1 mob on my level because I started attacking at 90% health.
---
That hadn’t occurred to me. I am pretty comfortable with spreadsheets and think I could easily set something up that included a “create new member by c/p their spreadsheet” leaving the only ongoing maintenance as “input raid date and check off attendees and what dropped/who took it.” Would that be helpful as a copyable google sheet?
---
Could be putting the carriage before the Tauren...thoughts on how it’d function as a distribution system after setup was out of the way?
---
Takes you like 10 mins to take the zeppelin yeah sure go ahead. The zeppelin is just east outside of org.
---
it's a good system and ideally what my guild will be using if we get the sheets squared away, it just has to compete with other systems that doesn't have nearly as much initial work to worry about
---
She did all that, and then rubbed the Bengay on my poor hands too
---
Well there's some way to make this work. Worst case scenario he can set his hearth in darnasses and then get a guildie warlock to summon him to SW for training.
---
Here I go killin again!
---
Right answer.
---
An item being made and accidentally never being added to the game but existing in the game data without being noticed honestly wouldn’t surprise me all that much. We only knew of the vanilla twin blades of azzinoth, that artifact ring, and Martin thunder because: 1 they were a gear type above legendary designated as artifact, 2 that Martin thunder incident that occurred around naxx, and 3 occasional test realm gm trolling. 
---
A random blue existing in game data and being unknown by the majority of the player base wouldn’t be surprising at all to me.
---
As someone who never played Horde in vanilla WoW, my question to veteran Shaman mains is this;  
---
  
---
*What do you wish you knew about playing a Shaman before you rolled?*
---
PVE all the way. I have a couple of reasons. First I'm bad at 1 v 1 PVP, and I never really cared to get good. I suck, I accept it, I'm fine with it.
---
Second is it really sucks enjoyment out if the game for me to get ganked and camped. That's just how I feel about it. So PVE suits me perfectly.
---
I do sometimes still play the larger BGs, where I can blend into a crowd. I even used to run a rogue in AV to backcap alliance towers. I liked this because it could turn the tide, and I just ran and vanished if caught. I got away with it often, so it was fun.
---
Well his argument is that it's too slow and dull and not a lot happens. Like BGs and Dungeons barely entertain him and I couldn't get him to 30 through RaF.
---
I would bet a lot of other teenagers these days feel the same way and Classic can be very slow and methodical, which they may not enjoy if Retail is too slow for them.
---
Your mother. But she knew I liked it.
---
Yeah. I played a paladin in beta and loved it. Then launch and . . .oh god why did I do this to myself. Just auto-attack for days, no interaction, and the risk of death is low, so why am I even here? It's too late to turn back.  2-3 minutes for one even-level fight. The urge to AFK is high, but I can't AFK for long enough to do anything useful, but I can't actually do anything useful in-game, either.
---
I'm playing either a priest or a mage this time around, because I'm never doing the paladin 1-60 again. It was fine at 60 (imo), as long as you didn't mind wearing a dress, but levelling was awful.
---
Am I the only one that finds battleground pvp dull?  Nothing gets the blood pumping like finally landing the frost shock that allows you to catch that rando that's been questing near you in STV.
---
I think healers should be getting the first orb then shouldn't they?   These waters aint cheap...
---
That's nasty, thanks for sending the screenshot so I can get it fixed! It should definitely not be happening like that.
---
Good to know. Thank you for the insight
---
On nost it was very hard to find a tank who wouldn’t call the first orb drop. Kinda bullshit but waiting for a tank who didn’t want first dibs was a waste of time
---
Isnt beta troll racial spitting out 20-43%?
---
absolutely, generally speaking, you want the mobs back to your party.  but if you plan to stop adds from fleeing mobs this way you would wipe.
---
Always have people on the ball with snares/roots/stuns and focus down low HP mobs.
---
Night Elves surprises me. Is it because most of their classes can be filled by a more optimal race?
---
I think for Rogue's the choices are usually really obvious.  I think Trash Blade, Mirah's Song, Blackhand's Breadth and Mark of Fordring are probably the most useful quest rewards to go for and you don't have to pass up on anything good when you pick those quest rewards.
---
It would be quite a bit more time efficient to level both the classes you want at 60 at once but it would take like %30 longer to get to 60 than it would if you just levelled the character you want to main. That being said dual boxing will basically make it so you can’t run dungeons in pugs and will probably have less fun leveling.
---
Is it worth mentioning the lvl 50 ST quest neck, which I also think is pre-raid BIS?
---
The range difference is nowhere close to a full second. Default movement speed is 8 yards/second. The Tauren range bonus is 2 or 3 yards from what I can gather. That puts you at 0.2-0.3 second.
---
For position  u could deviate fish
---
PvP
---
It can be frustrating but it also can be exhilarating. I have great memories of emergent gameplay from the old vanilla PvP days. Times where a cautious truce was formed or the time I created a bitter enemy. Stuff that just doesn't happen in the same way as on a PvE server.
---
10% at 100% HP and 43% at 40% HP.
---
Oh man i like this.  Do you have to keep the quest in your log?
---
Not according to the disagreement downvotes, apparently it's druid.
---
Not sure how druids can overcome the aoe-buff DPS boost for the raid while their primary damage spells also have less DPS per mana, but I'll see what the people who disagree downvoted me have to say, as surely they actually intend to respond and explain why I'm wrong.
---
Why would you assume 100% hp as a tank? And how does the tauren just magically get in 1 second sooner? Extended tauren range is NOT that far. Also the maximum atkspeed is 43% at 40% hp confirmed by blizzard
---
Sure, but then OP's perceived value with the Tauren hitbox is also removed. If you *know* you want to take tanking seriously, you're better off going Troll or Orc.
---
Current math (Melderon's) says RB or WF at any speed, the difference is negligible.
---
For a mage It's a bad idea to make gems in a fight because they cost more mana than they return. Unless there is a phase you can regen or maybe make one right before an evocate. I never did that but I'm just trying to think of when it might be ok. You're better off just making lower ranked gems ahead of time. 
---
You really just want to get a feel for how long the fights last and how much casting uptime you'll have. If I'm expecting to need more than one gem or Mana pot I'll use one as soon as I have used enough mana so I get the full benefit of it's use and start the CD early. Then evocate when I'm oom to bridge the gap till my pots come off CD. 
---
Most fights it's not a big concern. When your guild is learning nef you want to be aware of your Mana so you can aoe at the start of p3. KT is also one to think about since it's a longer fight and you want to have plenty of Mana to burn at the end.
---
rofl completely wrong, the answer is Paladin =&gt; Druid =&gt; Priest
---
Priest dps is beyond terrible even as shadow; aside from the fact noone brings a shadow priest because holy weaving is indisputably better and far more effective, and the fact that they get out dpsed by smite priests, shadow is too mana inefficient to dps and requires amazing caster gear and still deals the least dps out of all the hybrids.
---
Druids are consistently beaten by retribution in every single fight, and this is especially the case when its an aoe or multi target fight due to paladins having AoE damage literally in their rotation, furthermore even though the duid does offer the crit aura to the group nightfall on the paladin offers Nightfall, which is far more beneficial to the entire raid.
---
Yea paladins literally have one main attack, judgement which only works if you have a seal active. Each seal does something unique and if you judge it, the seal will stay on the target and provide a benefit. However that sounds cool but in reality you press two buttons from the moment you get your judgement spell at level 4 until level 60. The only other damaging spell you get for ret is if you spec into the holy tree and get an aoe that is really only used to pull rogues of of stealth in PvP using rank 1 or AoE farming lower level mobs.
---
Scamly has a really cool YouTube channel that talks a lot about the music of WoW and other stuff
---
Smells like she was nibblin’ on little pieces of shit!
---
Nvm . I returned the ultra wide. Didn’t like the drop of FPS and it was to big for my small desk. Back to the 25”
---
They have weak racials, can't be mages or paladins, and a lot of people think the starting area is too gloomy/dark, and too far away from the 'action' (stormwind/westfall/redridge is a hive of activity during the first week but teldrassil is deserted).
---
PvE-RP. I'm a casual, that's horrible at PvP. Choosing a RP server because I really enjoy the immersion of seeing people acting out their characters and stories.
---
&gt;  Troll has the greatest potential for threat generation followed by Orc. 
---
WRONG
---
That's a good idea. This is my second time around so perhaps I can sacrifice the race to 60 and work on professions. I never bothered with fishing/cooking so can do that too.
---
Nope.
---
Thanks for the list, I was only thinking  just thinking about this the other day but couldn't remember
---
Once you get level 4 and Judgement, you're fine.
---
In a group, heading to IF / SW at level 10 and 18 is nice for the boost from SoR upgrades, but otherwise, you're still contributing fairly well.
---
&gt;But, I just can’t get behind it. From 10 to 20, you just spam one button
---
that's a lot of classes in a lot of situations in vanilla wow lol, and you're only complaining about a class' early game leveling, which later has plenty of buttons to push
---
Or they are adults who understand the value of having capital in relation to the overall costs of debt. Being given 100k capital in my mid 20's would be literally giving me a million dollars in future income, if not more, in my lifetime. While it's not even in the realm of "quit your job" value, it's definitely retire 10 years earlier type money, atleast for myself. It wouldn't change a damn thing in my day to day life, but to think 100k capital "really isn't that much as an adult" makes me think you have more money than sense.
---
Sounds like a bug that needs to be fixed.   Also, if your tank is dropping to 40% on the pull, then something is wrong.
---
Warlocks are the only class I never leveled passed level 10. They never interested me.
---
The walk from their starting zone to the other 3 alliance races is awful. They are also sort of a "meme" since kids and non-serious players tended to pick them. They weren't really the best at anything, and "night elf huntard" was a very real thing back then. I would say night elf huntards are the main reason vanilla hunters still get a bad rap.
---
None of that changes the fact that you quotes him on something he never actually said.
---
The troll won't get the max result... Get real.   Also the tauren is sundering, and auto-atking 0.25 sec early.
---
tl;dr Nostalgia
---
It can in some cases, but not all. One example that comes to mind is the fel steeds in sfk. You clear out the court yard, and the one pack afterwards. Then you can keep one horse feared because anywhere it can run to should be clear of mobs. Then ideally you dot it up, have like a mage poly another horse, then you burn down the third one.
---
How is blizzard confirming how the game works a "bug"?
---
I'm not the one arguing with you. I'm just telling you that it's a weak move to act as though you're quoting someone when you're really just spewing something out of your own mouth and attributing it to someone else. I'm not that concerned about layering one way or the other or your validation of my opinions.
---
PVP. World PVP is my favorite part of the game.
---
each Alliance character can get 1 Fiery Blaze enchantment scroll from a Badlands quest. this enchantment adds an aoe proc that is unique and occasionally desired for wonky aoe grinding builds or by pally tanks. you can use your scroll on an item in a trade window, so don't waste it.
---
good stuff I am going to try it. I am at ilevel 400. Thanks for the input
---
I think I'll be playing a priest also, sounds like a plan! Enjoy :)
---
I’ve leveled almost every class 1-60, and almost all of them are more complex and engaging at low level than Druid. Hell, Hunter has
---
More going on by level 12 than Druid at 24.
---
It's NOT just 1 extra auto attack from Berserking. With Thunderfury it's 4 extra attacks and with THC it's 5 extra attacks. And yes, good tanks and healers coordinate so that the tank will drop to 40%, burn Berserking, and then call out for everyone else to burn their cooldowns.
---
Meme specs are specs that became memes. Unintended functions of the class that people try to make work.
---
It's your classic square peg, round hole situation. 
---
Examples being a Shaman Tank, a Melee Hunter, a Holy Shock damage Paladin ect.
---
Unfortunately the tryhards have tried their best to change the narrative and call anything they don't approve of as a meme spec.
---
Those are bad specs but not meme specs.
---
Healing meters in vanilla dungeons lol. This thread is about healing in dungeons.
---
Hope you rolled the right class and were assigned the right role for raids if anyone truly gives a fuck about your padding the meters.
---
Not to roll a warrior as my first char. Gave up at late 30s and made my shaman and fell in love.  I think history will repeat itself
---
A lot of people don’t like loch Modan for leveling, I usually skip it
---
You should do one only using that classes spells imo
---
Imo it works great! Mana is an issue early in the raids and mail gear is scarce apparently
---
&gt; I miss the challenge.
---
This is the only one you got wrong. Retail WoW end-game content is so much more challenging than anything Classic ever has to offer and has been for years.
---
You’re gonna have to do something before Westfall, whether it’s loch or darkshore, because it’s not really intended for level 10.
---
You wouldn’t have enough rep to get the NE mount by 40, this would just be for eventually at 60 if you wanted it.
---
Hell yeh
---
people downvote because they are having their feelings hurt by the truth, rather then actually having any validity to their opinions, the fact is druid is trash.
---
!remindme 39 days
---
Just saying I’ve never quested in loch modan before and I always go to westfall just fine.
---
I think I definitely had aspects of your little bitch friend back in Vanilla, many people did and do. You summarized it very well in a short comment, I will definitely aim to focus less on myself and more on the group collective. Should be a lot more fun!

I wonder if in pvp you made a frost shaman, so frostbrand, frost shock, and earthbind(may not even need that). In my head im kiting someone around with frostbrand while shocking them appropriately,  your 1hander and shield keeps you healthy while your out of range totems stay up and whittle them down. I wonder if this has been tried? FIRST!
---
I upvoted for the time spent creating this meme.
---
They're shit weapons, and way too slow to dump rage effectively.   Even if the +5 skill puts them above other weapons, they're still shit.   The tauren will generate more threat with a proper fast weapon.
---
&gt;Axe of the Deep Woods - 2.70 speed - that's 2.8 extra attacks 
---
You don't even know how to do basic math.....
---
10/2.7 = 3.7
---
10/(2.7/1.43) = 5.3
---
That's 1.6 extra atks with that axe, and that's assuming the max berserking, which won't happen 99% of the time.
---
A more realistic result would be like 20%.
---
10/(2.7/1.2) - 10/2.7  = 0.74
---
Now, what's better?   1/8 Sunder + 1/10 AA or 3/4 AA
---
not just raiding - which has ALWAYS been fun. i mean quests that matter. items that are actually RARE. or ACTUALLY legendary. the purple platter is awful, especially when combined with 'the daily grind'.
---
Yes mistakes happen and you should do your best to pull through instead of punishing someone.
---
However if it's the same dude making the same dumb mistake over and over let that fucker die.
---
What...  Even hunters will use wing clip in many situations.  Your statement is just so incorrect.

That priest is off camera casting levitate

On retail you get all expansions prior to the current one for free, so those old vanilla subscriptions are now legion subscriptions.

In truth we have no idea what they will do Day 1. Well find out  on launch

I'm letting my friends decide. It'll almost certainly be PvE or RP, and probably Alliance.

Left to my own devices I default to Horde PvP.

That formula is wrong, as confirmed by Magey on the Beta.
---
Not everyone wants to raid at lvl 60
---
Only priests have that luxury, sadly.
---
Ha! That episode was great
---
I see you are a man of culture.
---
Horse shit.   This is how it worked in vanilla.   The character sheet even tells you the atk speed.
---
Guess you don’t actually have assburgers or you’d actually know what the fuck you are talking about.
---
It's the aesthetics for me. "Default Spellcaster" has never done it for me in any game where there are weird alternatives, like warlocks, witches, shamans, bards, etc.
---
Gotta love mods when shit like this goes through and legitimate questions and discussion are removed or locked.
---
Growl and torment work the same, idiot, so there's 0 reason for the whole "hurr plural" wanking you start off with. You know that just because *you* keep saying that I am wrong doesn't make me wrong right? Those little arrows just show popular opinion it doesn't make you factually correct. "you wuz wrong for the threat" LOOL.
---
You have no fucking clue. Get the fuck out.
---
15 years ago we thought the hit cap was 8% or 8.6% with one guy swearing it was 9% without any evidence. Now we know it's 9%.
---
Look at Magey's numbers on Github. Doesn't matter what you think, the truth is that 43% haste is a full 43% reduction in swing time.
---
Tauren absolutely is not the best, BiS tank is troll with tf, without tf Orc is better. The TPS is more important than a little bit more health, trust your healers
---
1.13 is Classic. Classic.wowhead has updated its database, pulling stuff from the beta files. They consider all of that "new" data 1.13.
---
It will be there. I know at least one person, the streamer Staysafe, got it on his warlock during the beta.
---
Finally hitting Dark Pact was such a big deal for me back in the day. Suddenly - with just one talent point - you have seemingly endless mana.
---
Not true, if you are in a spec that doesn't have as much competition, you can easily accumulate items and dkp.
---
&gt;the biggest troll of the subreddit.
---
No he said Tauren was the best race smh
---
Thanks, I'll check it out *Kings honour friend*
---
deals self damage and self mana drain; it's extremely useful for tanks breaking cc on certain fights. It drains a random amount as a DoT each time you activate it but doesnt have a cooldown, so you can keep rerolling how much it does to you until it's an insignificant amount.
---
I never knew I wanted to do this until now.  Going to try to jump off, spin 180, and /salute before I fall out of emote range.
---
This. Vanilla wow is one of the easiest mmos of all time. That doesn’t make it bad but “challenge” is the last word I’d use to describe it.
---
That's not how LFR works. It gets released in waves. In the case of the last raid, there's over a month between Heroic/Mythic clears and when LFR raiders will ever get to the final boss.

And the differences in rewards are equivalent to T1 versus T2 in Vanilla.
---
I actually had to get used to doing this back in Vanilla/TBC.  My tanks were always in a rush, taking the fights on walks through the dungeon, never fighting in place.  If I could move ahead of the group without pulling anything, I'd do that and drink right after the fight.  Dungeons are a timed trial for some tanks.

Dwight - Ret paladin

Jim- undead rogue

I'm looking forward to getting my Enchanted Gold Bloodrobe again.

On a warrior you don't care about mana :) what you get this for is the self damage part. Fights where the bosses incapacitate you this is absolutely BIS, because any damage breaks the CC meaning you can cheese fights that are supposed to be tanked by two tanks. Most notable is the Orissoan encounter in AQ20.
---
Its also hilarious in PvP.
---
Honestly, there is great news. Retail WoW has been molded in its entirety into the game exact game you're looking for!
---
No, I meant the brand of tissue paper known for it's softness.

The Dave Ramsey plan is such a weird thing for me. Like, it's not very good financial advice, but it's good financial advice for people who don't really understand finances, which in turn might actually make it good financial advice. Mainly because the people who can recognize why it's not the best advice are the type of people who wouldn't need his advice in the first place. The reason I say this is because it's a "brute force" finance plan. It fails to incorporate any form of nuance in identifying which steps have the most efficient debt/interest or capital/yield dividends over relevant time tables, and to invest accordingly. It's essentially just Debt bad, Savings good, written out in step by step form. Again, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but with your level of income, you definitely could have paid someone to provide you a far more efficient financial plan.
---
Again, you say working differently, Blizzard says working how it should in comparison to the 1.12 reference client.
---
Blizz is lying.
---
Clearly 😉 how silly of me. 😂 In any case, I'm a resident of Goldshire (it's rural enough and the fact I can commute into town aside, there's no smelly horde cluttering up the place) so I can't imagine what you mean?
---
It's still free to upgrade to windows 10, they never said otherwise. 
---
They said "free upgrades through this spammy ass tool everyone hates will end" 
---
And they did.
---
If you get a copy of the upgrade, from the official Microsoft website, it will still do it's job at no charge.
---
lol k.
---
says the guy still hung up on World Buffs even though an original game designer confirmed they're not exploits, were intended to be stacked, and often tells people that Blizzard has changed Classic so World Buffs won't stack, which you pull out of your ass.

And this is why you don't even let your kids play on RP realms.

i wouldnt recommend druid to a first time player
---
I’ve leveled almost every class at some point in WoW’s history to the max level during different expansions.
---
I only just did a priest in BfA.  I only made it to 40 on one back in WotLK.  Druid didn’t fair much better either, in my book.
---
I’d say, Priest and Druid historically have been the hardest for me to get behind.  Funny that Priest is now one of my considerations, but Warrior is still sooo tempting to keep going to.
---
Get a 8gb usb-stick and install the win 10 installation tool on it (see below)
---
go to microsoft and download the windows 10 install tool

Install on his computer, you can reg it later with that win10 key for $2 that @Bernienojobtill40 told you about in the earlier comment.
---
Stacking is intended is not the same as saying that the current pirated server shit meta isn't exploitative.
---
Can you point out where exactly ? I'm looking at it and not finding any data on attack speed mechanics.
---
Ive never seen anyone pro holy leveling. What's the talent tree look like im curious
---
Q fucking Q. I hope you end up quitting Classic 5 days in because no one likes you and no one agrees with you.

As a tank warrior you want to pick:
---
Onyxia's blood pendant
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=18404
---
Over
---
Onyxia's blood talisman https://classicdb.ch/?item=18406
---
Why is that? 
---
If you are serious about tanking as a Warrior you will also be running engineering thus having access to the fire deflector trinkets which each give +15 fire res. There will also be other trinkets that are equally as good or better than the onyxia trinket in terms of avoidance. 
---
Onyxia's tooth pendant is the best option for a fire res neck in the game while also providing excellent stats. Both defensively and offensively.
---
I played pve in vanilla and now mostly miss classic for the pvp, so pvp server definitely.
---
You can use Windows 10 for free as long as you don't mind not being able the change the background image. An unactivated copy works perfectly fine though.
---
I'd be more worried about the hardware on what I assume is at least a 10 year old computer.
---
That isn't very nice.   I might have to report you.
---
Paladin.  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
Hmm, tough choice. not as many stuns at 29 for orc to resist. As paly stuns are not as long. Also rogues don't have kidney only cheap shot. Their both different, IDK which one I would consider better
---
If you're alliance, a paladin can put judgement of wisdom on the boss, and you can wand to get mana back.
---
I don't think so
---
Or you could see our interaction as the joke it is instead of getting sand in you're vagina and downvoting. Going round shitting on everybody and denying karma. Give me someone willing to have a little fun over a dirty downvoter any day. I'm going to bed it's 6am here but I truly hope hitting the downvote on all my posts gave you the positive emotive response you're fragile cognitive framework clearly desperately needs. Weak. (downvote this and you may get an erection. Tell your mum I said she's welcome) Night
---
thx, I'll report this to blizz.
---
I know it worked in actual vanilla, used fo use it on people after killing in world pvp
---
U 
---
Sure? What I read was that it will be just EU and NA servers, not language specific ones.
---
Yakelam I'm not saying that retail content is not harder than vanilla content. I get that it is and I agree with you.
---
However, If we're going to mindlessly ignore each other then I'll retort and mention that LFR isn't like UBRS or BRD because it's the same raid (as far as I'm aware) with the same bosses that are toned down.
---
Like imagine if vanilla had LFR and you could do an easy version of MC with a bunch of randoms. Then there was a lower tiered version of the core sets, thunder fury and so on...
---
Wouldn't that remove some of the magnitude of the raid and rewards?
---
I could be totally off base here but that's how I feel.
---
This threads about healing not playing a mage though.
---
Its a great spell
---
If your talking about pve there are 2 reasons:
---
1. There is no warlock curse that reduced nature resistance (for this reason raiding moonkins use starfire) so you will get a shitload of partial resists untill you get like 75 spellpen. This much spellpen can only be gained once you have some AQ40 gear
---
2. Shamans run out of mana faster than the other casters (mages and warlocks). Mages can cast a while and have mana pots + mana gems + evocation +45% mana regen while casting and warlocks can lifetap. For instance, in pre-raid bis, an elemental shaman can cast lightning bolt for about 90 seconds (with the use of mana pot and demonic rune) before running oom. On a 3 minute boss fight this just won't work
---
Nah, Discord does everything. A guild website can be used for showing off and applications, but that's about it.
---
Could you show me a source? I have tried finding an update
---
I hate it. Tasteless mess this desktop
---
I guess you have 0 crime in your area i guess everybody is holding hands and gelping 1 another where you know everyones name. The fuck are you so disconnected with reality to think that people on this planet give a fuck about you???? Hahahahahaha are you new here man?
---
If you did that same census for Warmode on retail it would turn out the same way. The survey data is only good if it asks the right people.
---
A hand picked invited beta influenced by 30+ streamers, or reddit/forum polls don't reach most PvE server players at all.
---
Yea, just the name Gateway alone. Gateway was aquired by Acer in 2007 so I highly doubt you are going to meet the minimum specs, especially on a laptop. Back then, most laptops didn't have anything more than graphic accelerators integrated on the CPU
---
&gt;I hate random PUGs with angry strangers.
---
this is a big one, i did a mythic+ today and linked meters at the end because people ask for it half the time and the tank called me the n word over it lmao, all because he thought I was "bragging"

"Maximizing the damage that you do is secondary to this"

so title is wrong.
---
I don't think you have an argument at all that forum and reddit users are skewed for PVP players.
---
I'm making one mostly to hone my own dev skills tbh. I've shown it to my mates and they don't seem to be as enthused as I am to say the least.
---
Personally speaking I think a really good guild website could be a great introduction for people to check you out. 
---
Also a forum is a lot easier to navigate rather than scrolling back infinitely on discord.
---
Depending on what guild you're running it could also be a good place to make your loot system more transparent.
---
If I was in your guild I would appreciate a website
---
Windfurry totem
---
Identity theft is not a joke Zen!
---
I agree with most. I would add the following:
---
I like the gear that drops or doesn't, not being disappointed when it drops but it's not titanforged.
---
I like when an epic is actual pretty rare and often takes months for the average player to level and get even one. And when it drops, you got it, you're not sad by the rng of it.
---
I like that there are inherit imbalances that are still disputed or offset by other imbalances, such that people still disagree about what class is better at xyz 15 years later.
---
I love that each class has a niche to fill, and you will have a harder time progressing if you don't bring a mix and use them fully.
---
I love that 5-mans were fairly challenging, certainly with pugs, providing genuine satisfaction outside of raiding.
---
I love feeling like my talent choices are meaningful and I'm sending my character down a certain path, rather than being able to switch instantly and freely.
---
I will miss some of the retail graphics, and even the scores (I love classic music, but they did do a great job on xpac music too imo).  Not nearly enough to gloss over the lack of meaning that I feel when given purples for solo dailies moments after dinging max level, or being able to run any 5 man with any composition of strangers cross realm that never say a word.
---
But they're going to make less money in the long run. What Durg said stands. It's stupidity.

Thanks this video is amazing.
---
Well until I turn off uBlock Origin, nothing loads. On Chrome and Firefox. And playing audio on load is a dick move.
---
Someone’s mad.
---
That's not true. Tanking's actually more complicated on retail because fights have so many more mechanics you have to track.
---
Not really, I just think your website is garbage and am pleased to find out uBlock Origin agrees.
---
Was going to say you'd need a website for tracking DKP, but I imagine bots have been made that let you do it in discord now.
---
The man wants to go to Westfall. Let him have this.
---
He's done work for me before. Just does it as a hobby on his spare time, his full time job is in the same field. It's frustrating, but I understand. I made the mistake of telling him I don't need it back until the end of August lol.
---
Terribly inebriated? Not  single typo, I call bullshit. SHENANIGANS!
---
I wonder how many HKs he ended up with. He didn't have the best technique but my god did he have the heart and dedication.
---
they changed it at some point post Vanilla to affect the group of the person you're targeting, I don't remember which expansion it was though
---
Ew, DKP. If you're lazy, use Loot Council. If you're not lazy, use Loot Lists. Google Drive will suffice.
---
Can confirm.. was a great PvP healer... total shit raid healer.
---
Try it out!
---
Pretty sure this dude is trolling...
---
I want to start by saying that I'm not saying it's necessarily going to be like this with you and your friends and I hope everything works out for you all. But, this is the reason guilds have trouble killing bosses, or the reason drama starts, or both. People who are part of a group where most people are so "valuable" that they think they deserve a spot no matter what they do. At some point someone will get jealous that you get to raid in this weird fun spec and they have to be some optimized cookie cutter thing. Actually, any time a group of people with "important" roles want to join a raid group it's a potential point of disaster. Too much potential for "well if my friend doesn't get to raid I'm not going to either." The raid leader would rather ruin the night of 1 person than 40 so the person who's just slacking off gets to come and the person who lost their spot because they don't have the right friends gets jealous. If I was in charge of recruitment I'd never take a large group of friends, and I'd be cautious with small groups.
---
Sorry to rant a bit. I just hate the mentality where a person thinks any one player should get a spot just because they're friends with the right people. I really do hope you and your friends have a good time though.
---
Its all down to your gear. The amount of +healing you have dictates how much you can downrank.
---
Hipotetically, lets say your FoL max rank after  gear and BoL, heals for 1500hp, and HL max rank heals for 3500 total non crit.
---
Now your tank takes around 500dmg per hit on average. You then downrank your FoL up to 800 healing, and have a slightly higher rank HL for bosses/spiky damage.
---
Your comment is invalid
---
Generally speaking, you use an add on like outfitter to equip/unequip gear so your hp is super low, pop berserking, get heals, run in and gain close to the full benefit,
---
Funny, when I did this a GM messaged me and told me I would be banned if I continued.
---
Of course, this was after like the 3rd time.
---
Different mob though, it was the one from Ashenvale, forget the name.
---
You’re thinking Phase 1 is a “small phase”, and I’m naive?
---
There’s going to be a total of 6 Phases throughout Classic’s span. Phase 1 isn’t insignificant. As a matter of fact because it’s the introductory Phase, one can say it is the most significant. Layering will drive a lot of people away.
---
If enough people layer hop and exploit resources throughout Phase 1 then yes the economy will be permanently damaged. How stupid can you lot get?
---
Stfu
---
Basically this. When you level up (doesn't matter which spec) get healing gear and heal dungeons.
---
Remember that the skill bar has two pages, which you can access with Shift + scroll wheel? Use the second page for healing talents in dungeons. Always have three ranks of Flash of Light ang Healing Light on the bar (lowest, mid and highest). Also have Holy Shock and Cleanse there. 
---
While healing, use low or middle ranks to heal usual damage and high ranks for big shit damage. If you do this until lvl 60,you will learn how to use ranks easily without guides. At level  60 you need to look up the most mana efficient ranks and probably respec into holy. That is all
---
Well it depends on what healing spec you use. And it's of course a kinda theoretical situation. I don't think there's many situations where you'd ask a healer to go full DPS for an entire fight and expect any meaningful DPS
---
A pally can spec 20 points or so into holy and then the rest into ret, and do ret DPS, which is far from great, but it's a DPS spec. 
---
Druids could do a Cat focused version of the HotW/NS build, use powershifting and Manual Crowd Pummeler, and do decent damage. They would mainly be lacking 10% damage from natural weapons and the crit buff from a full DPS spec. And cats can pull of very respectable damage if they tryhard. (Therefore this is my best bet, in a purely theoretical situation where this is your intention)
---
Shammy can go the famous ele resto build, and would definitely win if it was about burst, bit wouldn't provide sustainable damage throughout a fight. 
---
A priest I think is hard to spec in a way where it can actually be called a healing spec, and also deal damage, but I think I'd go with a Smite build just for the lolz. I know a friend's guild had a Smite priest on one of the private servers, and brought him along for BWL progress and all. And since a Smite build to my knowledge goes 31 into disc for the DMG buff, and the rest into holy for improved smite and holy fire, I guess that could work just fine as a healing spec.
---
Quite a few here: https://wallhaven.cc/search?q=wow&amp;categories=111&amp;purity=100&amp;atleast=2560x1440
---
Take stuff on here with a grain of salt. People on here, if they talk with any experience or knowledge at all, are talking about private servers, not classic. Expect to spend a while as prot spec if you're raid tanking.
---
If my main was any other than rogue I'd think about it harder. But as it is - pvp all the way baby.
---
no shadow priest damage is complete garbage, it is the lowest of all the hybrid classes, even out dpsed by a smite priest, the parses have been done i bis gear they are the worst hands down. Noone should ever take a shadow priest in any situation, holy weaver is the only viable spec.
---
The reason people have Nostalgia over Classic WoW is that it is a good game. It is an immersive world that you can get lost in. Can you say the same about retail?
---
The one in this video is the one from Ashenvale.
---
Definitely not just a WoW joke.
---
Sundering and auto attacking 0.25 sec early relative to what?
---
The threat starts when the threat starts. It isn't "early" unless you have two tanks both competing for threat which would be stupid.
---
This is before we even mention that charge is a thing.
---
I only bathe in the freshest taint waters available online

Hellgate:London was a really fun game fwiw. It just needed some aftercare to make it a long-term success. 
---
My friends &amp; I played the *shit* out of H:L
---
Those are fair points there but all of those things are required for gameplay which is the difference. Nothing about the core game design necessitates that the player is worshiped by every NPC and treated like a god just for buying a level boost. Having an important NPC go "well done guys" after you kill a raid boss is more than enough. Later expansions centered the entire storytelling around the fact that you were the sole commander/leader, I hate this in an MMO and would rather just be some thankless hero killing dragons with my boys.
---
I want to play a rogue for the sole reason to camp the Alliance in STV.
---
I’ve always farmed spellbinders. Are you sure about archmages?
---
Frankly as a Healer I plan on stopping and drinking the moment we are out of combat. Make it obvious to the group that I am the one who controls the pace of pulling
---
If you're getting hit in melee range it is not cutting, it's that simple.
---
!RemindMe 38 days
---
Well, I definitely disagree. WotLK is when the story really started mattering to me, before that it was just a good game.
---
^This pretty much. A very large portion of warriors simply dont tank.
---
When i played warlock on a pserver i found hunters to be one of the easiest targets in wpvp. Since i will play hunter when classic releases i just wanted to inform you :) be aware of warlocks
---
&gt; I like when an epic is actual pretty rare
---
We used to call that Netherstrike as "nexustrike", because nobody wanted it and we usually just disenchanted it.
---
I think all the sunken temple class quests oyu mention in the guide were only added in phase 4. affects:
---
* warlock quest for the scythe
---
* hunter quest for the devilsaur eye trinket
---
* warrior quest for the flask
---
i agree with this. just be a fury only warrior
---
tbh it takes around 30 minutes to get IF Storm Menetil flight points and go back to starting zone as a NElf. Find a drowning trick in youtube. There is a place north to IF, close to Menetil, u die there in the water and spirit ress at Coldridge Valley

Blizzard should just start over I’ll rebuy burning crusade 😂😂
---
WoD is when the story went full retard in my opinion and every expansion after that I find the writing to be offensively bad.
---
Oh shit. To be honest I never even thought about that. Wow- that explains a lot.
---
i see what you did there XD
---
This is kinda dumb.  Worgen were introduced in vanilla, and also endless patch notes (and huge controversial changes!).  Pandas were not included but people were wondering where they were... since pandas were in Warcraft 3.
---
Vanilla used to be a new thing that people thought was dumb.  "Everquest-lite".
---
OP is just using tedious formatting to say "I'm a curmudgeon".
---
IIRC Archmages only dropped it in later patches (like, post-TBC).
---
Thanks, I thought that would be the case for classic. Just wanted to make sure I didn’t miss anything obvious.
---
I’m returning because I’m also an older player with life responsibilities so what I really want is lulzy social sandbox where I can pew pew people. Classic is the perfect outlet for that.
---
WoD was ugly, but Legion was good and so far the main narrative of BFA is good.
---
PvP- because pve realms are only half the game
---
I literally couldn’t imagine playing when you feel safe all the time.
---
Millennial mode
---
My guild has the policy that getting world buffs will be optional unless we get stuck on a boss for an extended time. So maybe for aq40/naxx we'll get them. But like in MC that one boss wiped all your buffs anyways, so kinda pointless for then. Personally I think I'll try to do a DM tribute run before hand to get those buffs (and well tribute runs are good money anyways), but I don't want to go full try hard running all over the damn world for them all.
---
No one tell him it's a free game with only a monthly subscription

1.13 didn't exist, 1.12 was last content patch before tbc. 1.13 is the Classic patch but it's basically 1.12+

I'm no shaman expert  especially since I didn't play a shaman yet. I plan to play one this time so I read and watched a few guides.
---
But even at the first glance I don't know what is the spec number 1 suppose to provide. A little bit more survivability against melee?
---
Spec number 2 is way better imho. It's more universal and Nature Swiftness is really strong tool especially since you can use it offensively. I would just get Improved Healing Wave instead of Spiritual healing. 
---
Elemental mastery is nice when you want to oneshot people but NS is still a better tool overall.

---
&gt; I'd love to see it graphically overhauled completely

I was watching a vid of azeroth made in UE4 and I quickly realized I actually dont want that, it is so far gone and different from what I grew up playing and it feels much more fake to me than wows artstyle does by far

Mage. I always saw myself as a wizard as a kid, but when wow came out I levelled 1-60 as a mage on Stonemaul (alliance) and hated it. Rerolled as a balance druid at 60 and absolutely loved it.
---
You... You can't do both at the same time as horde... only Nelfs.  
---
Sorry.

I mean, not being a native speaker, this was super confusing :D

Somebody fill in the mage section pls, thanks in advance lol

Communication that is non existent in retail, when all those pugs want to solo play without voicechat.

---
Only $30 a bottle.
---
Spec one is kinda all in and drop a healing stream + have an aegis. Stun resist op.
---
It would be for more melee heavy events, possibly pug BGs where a lot of mid gear melee roam.
---
Spec 2 is for when I have a team the knows what they are doing or for caster dominant times, such as devilsaur wpvp or premades.
---
Admittedly I can probably remove the hit talents and go for extra armour or interuption prevention.
---
- 
---
As for the PvE end, I have a couple Nost shamans helping me min max.
---
Any ones you reccomend
---
&gt;I do remember "Loot X items" quests being a huge pain in the ass
---
They're really not.  Just put loot on FFA and then switch the main toon once you're done with the first.  Use hotkey.net or isoboxer and it easy to switch between toons.
---
I did a bit of dual boxing on a private server to around 25, speed wise it's pretty close to a solo toon, but combat is also too easy.  Not ideal in my book.  
---
I may do it when classic launches, but it would only be for utility alts like a couple of mages( I hate leveling mages) for ports/water/food for my primary toons.  Any other classes are going to be leveled normally.  I generally spend half my time PvPing while level and dual boxing PvP isn't really that fun.
---
Not exactly but it goes that way. As tank, you jump into a group, pop your offensive CDs and will have aggro. It is nearly impossible to lose aggro when you don't forget to press any glowing button.
---
Congrats on all fronts, and I hope you get attached to WoW like we all did :)
---
I was never big on private servers and just hoped blizzard would one day release vanilla servers, and here we are just a few short weeks away!
---
I'm ready to shake the bad gaming habits I've accumulated of the past few years and instead of just playing a game for 2-4 weeks when it releases and hop to the next -
---
I plan on taking Classic slow and steady to smell and enjoy the flowers one last time.
---
I was 13 when I started gaming and it began will Vanilla Call of Duty.
---
15 years, a bunch of bad CoDs and a bunch of bad WoW expansions later... I'm ready to fully engage into Vanilla WoW and can't wait to see Captain Price in Modern Warfare later this year.
---
While I don't have high expectations (after being beaten down so long with these 2 franchises) I'm going to slow it down and enjoy both Classic and Modern Warfare this fall and winter.
---
Welcome to WoW and I hope you have a ton of fun and make plenty of friends throughout your time in Classic!
---
And it can be done for the next pack while you finish the last.
---
I'm not a vanilla newcomer but, im stoked on your stoke man.
---
Make your own path!
---
Yep! Totally doing the same thing for the same reasons!
---
&gt; Each time you switch layer a stacking cooldown is accumulated that has to run out before you can switch again so it's not something you can do very often.
---
No. There's a short cooldown based on combat, looting, gaining experience, and some other things, but changing layers does not invoke any cooldown itself.
---
This. Beating Highmaul was fun the first 2 times, I loved Mythic raiding but the fact it was my 20th clear of the raid really killed my appreciation for it.
---
Timesink is a better word. Everything you do costs a lot of time.. I actually like it but theres no definitive bad or good.
---
While .3 ms slower if you have enough paladin's to maintain Judgement of the Crusader and said seal's and the necessary threat, you can pull decent extra damage and get regen.
---
Oddly enough i seen a copy of one a few months back in a pawn shop previously opened for $10 i had to let them know it is garbage.
---
Damnit you're right.
---
&gt; free
---
&gt; monthly subscription
---
choose one
---
Well if you want more survivability in spec 1 (spec 2 is still way better imho) then I would suggest you to drop 5% extra mana and get the Shield Specializacion. As u/Cimsonak\- mentioned shaman have issues with mana efficiency so 5% more mana won't provided that much and you won't be able to stack intellect in PvP to get more out of this talent.
---
Most of us wish we could experience classic blind again with no knowledge of the game i envy anyone that gets that experience with the launch of classic.
---
So someone had like a warrior did damage and noticed his damage range was perfectly in line with the character sheet?
---
I know we know rag has 3731 armor now. how does that tell us we can drop it to 0?
---
We know  Faerifire, CoR and Sunder Armor stack, but do we know how they stack?
---
No matter we know this is an upgrade, im just saying i don't know the math for this so i don't claim to know that boss armor will be 0. Unless you have a confirmation of this some where. Videos of Rag is rather ambiguous.
---
Right click strafing is objectively worse tho. You cant target a specific target while strafing for instance because you are already using the right click. I mean why wiuld you use A/D+Rightclick to strafe when you could just press A and D. You are pressing ine more button (an important one) just so you can retain a useless feature which is keyboard turning
---
I had fun downvoting this idiot troll's comments, Troll is proven BiS. It isn't 10% haste if you know how to use it, good guilds know how to use it. Your tank dropping to 50% isn't scary if your guild is experienced. If it's a tough fight your hp drops enough to make use of it anyways, potentially twice in 1 fight if im remembering the CD correctly. You can also unequip gear, get the 40%, equip gear, harge in while heals inc and even if you lose 3 seconds the remaining X seconds are increased by 300% effectiveness due to being 400% of the base amount of haste. I plan to abuse zerking every single fight this way as my troll mage, top of dem meters er'day.
---
Ill be back for this list in a month
---
I agree 100%.  I really hope for Classic +.
---
dwarf females in classic look better than wod+
---
but hey u play ud so u wouldnt understand
---
I played on a private server briefly, and it was really fun. Then I came to the realization that it could be shut down at any point and all progress could be lost. Also, there were elements that did not have that authentic feel to it and it wasn't approved by Blizzard. I stopped playing, but ever since I have been really hoping that Blizzard would come out with exactly what they are coming out with on 8/27. I just hope they do not add expansions for classic WoW, if they do I would be very aggrieved if they upped the level cap.
---
is it worth mana burning a shaman as a priest in pvp/wpvp?
---
On the right side of the screen there should be an option that lets you select to show flair. You can select that and choose what you want to display there.
---
Flying mounts killed world pvp
---
Dailies were horrendous
---
Raids shrunk to 10 and 25 man killing guilds
---
Sanctuary City?
---
Only few world bosses
---
Resilience
---
Melderon neglects to mention the fact kiting reducers downtime BC you take next to no damage.
---
The info is good, but the execution he uses with gameplay to get those graphs is lousy.
---
He is coming out with a third video after getting a lot of feedback on leveling speed and weapon efficiency.
---
Thank you, helped me me alot, have a good day.
---
i'll choose "one" vs bfa's "all of the above"
---
Yes, just like the fools that bought an original first edition Superman comic, they will be behind us for the rest of their lives.
---
I thought I read somewhere that Really Sticky Glue could be used in the KT fight in Nax. Something about rooting mind controlled players in place.
---
Wow! I appreciate the time you spent on this for me. It's very nice!
---
You can get a permanent 11mp5 trinket at that level though [Mindtap Talisman](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18371)
---
Ordered this book after seeing another post about it. Halfway through atm &amp; would highly recommend
---
Probably PvE, but i originally rolled on a PvP server,  
---
if [https://vanillafriends.com/](https://vanillafriends.com/) has anything to say about it however, i might end up joining a PvP server again however.
---
Your labor isn't free
---
Every issue you list has been introduced to counter a lot of problems Classic WoW had for the avarage player: Then only a ridiculously few number of players had the chance to actively raid, then it could take half a day to just assamble a dungeon group (let alone run the dungeon), then raid groups were forced to follow a certain class composition, and so forth.
---
Classic WoW, if you wanted to raid actively, was basically a second full time job with quite strict rules, if you wanted to see everything and the devs eventually saw this and made changes. That may have taken a deal of fun away for you, but it has added a lot for a far bigger part of the community.

You sound sad
---
38 is the lowest (sweet spot) you can switch over to elemental, and I would high recommend it.
---
You can level faster than any other shaman spec solo by just spamming only lightning bolt, and you wont compete with gear with the warrior. The extra SP and int from gear plus having a shield makes you tankier, and a far better healer too.
---
Make sure to stock up on America Online cd's so you don't run out of internet on the journey to 60.
---
Congrats with the gainz!
---
i will play ud shadow priest tallents 0/3/48 sure maybe controverse but this is the way i will go pvp and pve.
---
I assume that one of the main advantages of dungeon running as a warrior is that you always have good gear from drops
---
&gt;Get the initial aggro. If a dps attacks before the mobs are at your position he will get aggro and the mobs wont attack you which means you wont get rage to get the aggro back. Tell the dps to wait for you to get the inital aggro.
---
Warn the DPS once. Then kick the DPS. Get a new DPS.
---
fair enough. So you are saying unless you are a assmon watching zoomer reddit is not for you. Enjoy it your way I will just refrain from calling out assholes, and move on.
---
I'm not sure what you're saying given what you're replying to, but in case we're misunderstanding each other, what I understood from your "all of the above" comment was that you can pay for the sub or get it for free with enough gold. I was just saying it shouldn't be considered free if it requires a decent amount of work to get it for "free," since the time you put into things is worth money too.
---
oof
---
This is the spec I'm.aiming for as well.
---
Imp ghost wolf with PvP boots giving you 1.61% move speed as a caster is fucking op when outdoors.
---
Paladins can't kill you because you can snare and purge, and kiting melee and catching up to hunters becomes ez. Best part is druids struggle to run away, and you can do the same to a bad matchup.
---
I'm not talking about the rate of new content.  I'm talking about what is included in that content.  TBC had a lot of mistakes.  No reason to repeat those same mistakes.  You can add avenues for player progression that isn't just increasing the level cap.
---
Battle Shout is better than Demoralizing Shout.
---
Revenge is the best rage generator, use it every single time it's available.
---
I disagree with this. There are very few options for trinkets with tanking stats or +defense if you want to go as close as you can to the Defense cap. (Only 4 trinkets in the game with +Defense, The other 3 being Styleens, BWL drop. Force of Will from BRD and a Green quest item)
---
There is the Neck you get from Onyxia attunement if you want a fire res neck, it has more stamina/Fire res, but it does lack the other stats.
---
The Fire Deflector has 3 more FR but none of the tanking stats (Defense again...)
---
If you want to build a Fire resistance set for tanking Ragnaros, you really should get guild help for it. Getting the 5 epic Dark iron pieces with enchants gets you to 179FR, then theres off pieces like rings, neck, trinkets. You only need 225 if memory serves, the rest you get from Mark of the wild and Totem/pally Aura and by getting the FR with as few items as possible you can keep your regular tanking gear giving you overall better stats.
---
There are other viable neck pieces for when you want to go DPS. 
---
When you swap to Tier gear from Blues, generally you will go Down on defense, making you more susceptible to Crits.
---
TL:DR Trinket Availability.
---
In a perfect world where level 60's didn't camp low levels I'd roll on a pvp server. But I'm old and have less time to play than I used to and I straight up think that rushing to 60 is just stupid. PvE for me. I might even go full on insane and go RP.
---
Bonechewer was my original server!  I remember VM very well. Shout out to Escaper on horde!
---
as i plan to roll an alliance healer and tank alt, i'm glad i will never have to dungeon with someone as toxic as you.
---
D&amp;D books. I basically stole a name from one of those, as I've always been terrible at naming things.
---
It's pretty ridiculous of you to make this claim.
---
Fuck... There really is only one build that is the same for PvP and pve from all of the classes from what I know and its a Shadow priest. Rest is all requiring respec...

“After days of discussion, Dana severed the dungeon from the outside world by putting the ship inside a giant cavern (the Goonies solution), which prompted changes to the engine because interior spaces weren’t supposed to be that big.”
---
Excerpt From
---
The WoW Diary
---
John Staats
---
I think it’s hilarious that redesigning the deadlines to be fully indoors was referred to as “the Goonies Solution.” Originally concepts for the deadmines had an exterior portion with the warship as the final boss area. The problem was they didn’t know how to prevent players from jumping into the ocean / trying to leave the instance.
---
And why would they do anything differently when they know exactly how much of a player increase they saw in burning Crusade, and then again in Wrath, 10 or 12 years ago?
---
I started playing towards the end of Wrath, but I never hit level cap until Cata, and I believe that Classic TBC does not necessarily lead to Classic BFA. The original trilogy of expansions were very different to Cataclysm, I noticed it immediately when Cataclysm was released, and so at most Classic TBC would lead to Classic Wrath.
---
That being said, I think that following history exactly as it was would be a mistake. Daily quests, flying mounts, dungeon finder, these things all brought the game down in my opinion. To implement them a second time would be disheartening to me. I also felt sad that I could never do previous raids as intended, for example, I could solo molten core.
---
I think that we should learn from past mistakes and add more content to Classic without following history word for word. I mean, sure, that does mean trusting that publishers and devs won't fuck it up, but I think that risk is worth it, rather than following the exact same timeline and make the same mistakes again.
---
Dwarf gives poison self removal and fear ward or human 5% spirit (about 1 mana every sec and 8 extra spelldamage whit good t2.5-t3 gear) human a d dwarf has a good instant self heal or druid for shadowmeld and the ability to bait a counter spell on non shadow spell or still cast spells when shadow loked. most ppl will say dwarf I like human what you really want is troll for shadow guard
---
Personally for Ally id say dwarf, stoneform can actually help against rogues by removing their poison and bleeds, nelf is alright with shadowmeld and that dodge priest spell (can't remember what it's called) but that's kinda niche in my personal opinion, human as far as I'm aware doesn't have many benefits in combat, but the rep racial is convenient.
---
You don't need to be def capped. Where it matters shield block is sufficient.
---
For avoidance there are equally good or better trinkets.
---
Not picking onyxia neck is a huge waste.
---
It’s amazing!
---
A..k.a. don't be a shadowpriest.  Or at least don't be so most of the time hoping for a bright future that it's unlikely to happen due to burnout.
---
priest checking in.  
---
i have 2 cc's  
---
shackle on undeads only, which requires casting and will likely instantly break if it has dots on it, which it will.  
---
fear, which will be a self cc, since death from pulling 5 nearby packs, is the best cc.
---
I've set up a website, but mostly as a notice-board to convey the critical information
---
+ Expectations (of Guildies)
---
+ Raid Schedule (which is mainly just a recurring time slot)
---
+ Loot Rules/Distribution/Mechanism
---
+ Personal (player designed) quests (i.e. gathering quests).
---
+ Guild Specific Strategies (for boss encounters).
---
***
---
I won't be setting up a guild forum.
---
My objectives as far as a guild is concerned (and the general philosophy) probably vary a bit. If I was going to set up a hard-core progression guild though I'd probably go to the effort of setting up a proper (member based) forum, if for no other reason than to ensure expectations for each and every class were in order (in a documented way) in order to minimize drama on raid night.
---
Share a link!
---
Glad you lost some weight, good motivation to better yourself pre-WoW drop. Now work on your grammar, cause jesus christ those periods.
---
You are talking about liking BFA over Classic.  This has nothing to do with my post, which is focused on what to do after Classic.
---
The Classic player base likes the things you don't like.
---
You can redeem the 3 collectors edition pets, maybe that's what you're thinking about.
---
It calculates with 3PM release on 26. right?
---
Would be nice if you could change the timezone.
---
This is just wrong and when it comes ti raids this is more the case in classic than in retail. How many buttons does a mage press in MC?
---
&gt; , I feel like the idea of a Classic+ is kind of dismissed 
---
Because it's a laughably bad idea from every perspective.
---
That's more of just a foot note about when the release happens. It doesn't specifically have logic in place to cap your launch day hours at "9" or whatever. I figured that if someone was intent on hitting 60 within 4-5 days they probably didn't need a tool like this to help them. When you get into the 10+ day range, this becomes a bit more useful and it's really just helping giving guidance. It's not perfect in the sense of time zones/etc.
---
Never change Reddit.
---
A single one, mage or hunter. Stuck at level 35 for max alchemy and a second profession depending on my main, default being enchanting in order to DE stuff.
---
In Vanilla, PvP has a big role to play, it's a lot of content, and there is no separation between PvP and PvE gear.
---
I feel like rolling on a PvE server is missing 50% of the game experience. Here's a little list :
---
* Huge Guild versus Guild fighting on World Bosses
---
* Group PvP to get into a dungeon / raid
---
* Taren Mill vs Southsthore
---
* It makes PvP Ranks and gear lot more "senseless"
---
* It makes the world less imersive and feels less hostile
---
I didn't include world / wild PvP because greykills and ganking can be annoying and it's the only drawback I can think of.
---
You can solo devilsaurs for leather solo with lightning bolt and your ranged snares quite easily.
---
Eventually, you can do lasher pacts or dog farming in DM when that is available.
---
Best way to make money is just playing the AH however if you're saavy at video game economics.
---
Other than that, farming cash mobs like bats, basilisks, vultures, spiders and scorpids is good too. Your g/hr will be limited by your gear tho. You could also try farming elemental air,fire,water and earth. Things like that.
---
!remindme 34 days
---
If he is resto, absolutely,
---
I'm pretty sure they added that in at the tail end of the beta.
---
!remindme 36 days
---
More fibre mate, gonna run yourself dry with that decimal diarrhea.
---
Okay, understandable.  
---
Then it's pretty easy for EU player, just need to change the start date to 27.
---
In bfa, all three of those payment methods exist.
---
In classic, only one will exist, the monthly sub.
---
Buying tokens is null since it's a two way street, you can buy them or sell them.
---
What if I take both engineering and enchanting?
---
Spirit does not give spell damage to a shadow priest...
---
English is not my native language and these dots are more like long pause. What is a propper way to do it? :D
---
Why would there be more US players than EU players?
---
It's not toxic and it doesn't mention private servers, that's why it gets to stay up.
---
As the game progresses to aq40/t3
---
Mage is auto win against hunter and shadowpriests 1v1
---
Warlock is still difficult.
---
No, I talk about changes to WoW that happened immediately after classic. Beginning with Burning Crusade the devs have changed a lot in the way the game went: Introduced flying, changed the specs so more became viable, changed the classes themselves so they became more versatile, etc. This is not a BFA and not even a Cata thing.
---
Negative.
---
I believe I addressed this question in argument #6 of "Arguments Against Classic+".  Besides, the decline started during Wrath's lifecycle.  The early increase was riding on TBC's coattails.
---
What? Durotar least populated than tirisfal? hahaha
---
Michael - Prot Warrior
---
Dwight - Frost Mage, Fire post-BWL, complains when he doesn't get the ignite proc for himself.
---
Jim - Rogue that occasionally raids in PvP spec when he can get away with it
---
Pam - Holy Priest
---
Toby - Resto Druid, secretly wants to play kitty dps but Jim gets all the agi leather
---
Kevin - Warlock
---
Stanley - Nightfall &amp; Tranq Shot Hunter, can't raid on taco day, no one notices when he afk autoshots or just doesn't show up on raid day
---
Andy - Ret Pally/Ele Shaman, grudgingly raiding to gear out for PvP
---
Ryan - Fury Warrior, complains about how warrior dps is BiS and then underperforms even when he gets that sweet BiS gear for the current phase
---
I wouldn’t mind if they add player housing and battlepets (I don’t even like that) in classic + I feel like this won’t change the core of classic but adds little fun and extra game content which 100% won’t break the game while other things can be dangerous
---
I’ve played since nostalrius. I’ve done 1-60 stupid fast on every pserver. 
---
On classic launch, I will play the way I played in 04. Take my time. Make friends. Do dungeons. World pvp. Level professions. Make gold. To sum it up; iam going to have a fun and chill experience.
---
Hahahahah
---
Was definitely the reason lol.
---
One period, thats all. Its a pause already.
---
I feel like the existence of Old School Runescape shows it's definitely possible to take the game in a different direction and make it better.
---
You have never ever played Horde. Tirisfal is the least populated, challenged by Mulgore. Undeads migrate to Durotar to level up.
---
What's laughable about creating new game content?  They're making a BFA+ right now called "Age of Darkness".
---
He is 200% wrong, Durotar is ALWAYS the most populated by A LOT. Undeads and Taurens migrate to Durotar to level up quite a bit. This guy doesnt know what he's talking about.
---
Warriors will have threat problems in Classic where they didn't on private servers, especially on the horde side. Mages and rogues are the key classes in Classic, on completely made up servers warriors and warlocks can do a lot more damage since threat doesn't matter.
---
&gt; Taren Mill vs Southsthore
---
Was still a thing on PvE servers but I'd imagine it being more large scale on a PvP server.
---
Yeah, I know. I really don't know why you're saying all this. My original reply to the other person was just pointing out how calling the game "free" with a monthly subscription is contradictory.
---
[found it on wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/object=177226/book-evil-soothsaying-for-dummies#english-comments)
---
I'm too much used to my native language where if I end the sentence with perion I need to construct whole structure again. Thanks for the correction:)
---
I started in Vanilla as a troll and re-rolled belf in tbc - I’m Horde through and through. Blood elves aren’t the worst thing to happen to the horde - stop trying to be edgy you’re not a teen anymore.
---
TBC is better.  100x better than classic.
---
The thing is that Classic TBC has a chance of being a thing. Classic+ with new raids and zones is a pipedream.
---
Even during actual vanilla, while leveling as arms using 2-handers for clearing trash packs improved the speed of the run.  The mitigation difference between a warrior with 2hander vs shield when not prot and not shield blocking isn't all that high.  In exchange you get a warrior with high rage who is probably going to outDPS anyone else in the party with sweeping strikes/WW/cleave.
---
2H arms isn't always ideal for dungeon leveling but it is definitely the best option in some cases.  For bosses I almost always just went back to 1-hander and shield to be on the safe side.
---
What's with the random comma?
---
Dwarf was my first thought, going to be a slow paced leveling experience since its going to be my alt.
---
Yet TBC also introduced flying mounts. Classic+ is where they implement the good aspects from TBC without the bad ones.
---
Leeway only works if the opponent is running away from you, so not a boss mob that's just standing there
---
You are missing the som very big things first of when you are 60 most of the world is already obsolete you are probably not running around in valley of trials any more for example. Second increasing level cap gives new players a chance to catch up if you start playing the game a year after release chances are you are not going to se all of the current end game content let alone content that requires you to do previous content. Third you only cater to the raiding population the game needs to appeal to a larger population and revitalising the leveling experience is a big part of this.
---
Well TipsOut said so so...I'm more inclined to trust his information than yours, sorry :/
---
Bad to you.
---
Hello everyone,
---
Two months ago, I challenged myself to change my life before WoW arrives. The counter on my countdown showed 100 days and the counter on my scale showed 134 kg. I am 34 years old. I have a wife, a two year-old daughter, and a very challenging and time consuming job. 
---
I was looking for a few years for an impulse to change my life - to wake up one hour earlier, exercise every day, lose some weight - for my daughter, for my wife, for myself. But I couldn't do it and then I decided that if I want to play Classic then I *must* do it, otherwise it will turn even worse.
---
For the last two months, I wake up at 6am, train for 30 minutes and swim once a week. Now I am 10kg lighter, I have a lot more energy, and I sleep better. It feels good!
---
I'm writing this as part of my motivation plan. I promised myself that I'd do it if I lost 10kg in order to tell anyone who might be struggling like I did that it's worth it, even 10 minutes of exercise every day.
---
That's it for now - see you in the game! 
---
Cheers!
---
This is true, but I'd like to add that warlocks should be using Major Mana Potions as often as mages (cheap consumable) and Dark/Demonic Rune if you play in a more serious environment since Life Tap uses a GCD and will result in quite the dps loss if you rely on only tapping in fights. Because, well, you play dps to do dps right? Even if you play casually.
---
I want Classic to develop into something new using old assets but with vanilla philosophies. So we would basically get a continuation of WoW as it could have been.
---
And thus, OP's argument is flushed down the toilet.
---
The biggest push for people wanting TBC is simply because those people started in TBC or finally hit end game there, and that's just their version of vanilla to us who only played vanilla.
---
In reality, TBC was kinda shit aside the raid /dungeon content. But for pve players, sure it was good.
---
End of the day, I'd rather see classic+ over TBC, for me personally I'd rather stop playing than go TBC.
---
It depends on how you spec I sould have said ider spelldamage or mana but most likely mana regen but yes you are right
---
hahaha more inclined to trust TipsOut? The guy that's ~$25 million in debt after attempting to defraud Los Angeles and calling them racist when they refused to lift his company's ban?
---
Well, at least you're already accustomed to arduous, uphill struggles.
---
Well done!
---
I was never #nochanges thanks, I've always believed that following OSRS's lead would lead to a better game. Regardless, I was arguing against your original point, not whether or not flying mounts are good or bad. Classic+ is not laughably bad from every perspective, OSRS gives the idea credibility.
---
Thanks for the reminder. No way I'm gonna no life it. With kids and work and all. Just want to ensure 1 or 2 dedicated evening sessions per week.
---
It's been proven that games are costing less actually, like 4 times less
---
You can look at the expenditure/profit statements Acti-Blizz and other companies release annually to see this
---
It's a lie that games are costing more.. sorry
---
..Shield slam has a long cd.. revenge also and it's not always going to be up. Sunder is cheap and only gcd.
---
Sounds like a solid plan :-)
---
Okay, I thought you were talking about making raids the focused content and LFR/LFD.  But regardless, those things are now largely considered to be mistakes by those pushing for Classic WoW.  These solutions are now criticized heavily by those that don't like BFA.  Flying mounts, dungeon queues, removal of "elite" content, all of it.
---
PvP.
---
PvP is the fun part, and pve is just a chore to get the better gear to PvP with.
---
Pretty much the best item you can get for Ele Shaman PvP from Dungeons/Raids is the [Natural Alignment Crystal](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19344). Because it can be used simultaneously with *+SP for X Seconds* trinkets like ToEP/ZHC/REoS.
---
The best Ele PvP gear is all from AQ40 and Naxx though. So you're gonna have to be a healbot if you want a chance at it.
---
Well, sort of. Dualwielding is actually okay for lvling but 2h-fury and Arms are both better options.
---
Extra spirit us extra mana while casting and eaven better whit spirit tap while farming
---
There is no shadow spec where spirit gives you spell damage.
---
I agree with most of your points, but as someone who didn't get to play before Resilience existed, I wonder how PvP gear can exist without it being overshadowed by PvE gear, or how PvP gear could exist without it being a way to avoid some PvE. I'm not defending resilience, but legitimately asking. How do you effectively separate the two without a stat that is specific to one of them?
---
Was frostmourne RoC or FT?
---
Warrior will also be the most numerous class in any given raid. Most raids will have 1 MT, 2 primary OTs and 5-6 fury warriors (but that are also required to OT on certain trash/bosses).
---
If you are a warrior and willing to tank, you will find groups, raids and a guild.
---
Thanks for appreciating us at least :D
---
RemindMe! 30 days
---
Just because you couldn't see it doesn't mean it didn't exist in the lore/universe.
---
I never understood the ridiculous love for TBC. I did play through it and I did enjoy it, especially after getting the Glad shoulders + Glad 2 hand sword, but it was not nearly as epic as Vanilla.
---
The daily quests were the biggest chore hidden behind a gold/rep reward ever, Arenas were not a good aspect to PvP, Resilience absolutely destroyed the homogenous PvP system as well as world PvP encounters, the art style was much different to the previous things and did not contrast well at all.
---
I think one of the few things that TBC made better was how classes felt.
---
Great list! I hope you'll be filling those blanks :P
---
ONLY the raids/mythic+ are challenging, what about the open world content though? In BfA you can literally pull 40 mobs at once and kill them with 3 spells, you can barely pull 3 mobs in Classic and hope you don't die. 
---
What about gearing? It's like not even in the game anymore, you can just get free items from everywhere in BfA. Questing and leveling are a joke as well.
---
There's nothing really interesting in BfA besides raiding and farming old stuff, that's why the game has under 2m subs right now.
---
Frostmourne existed in Classic in lore.
---
I'm all for integrating defense into PvP specs because you can't do damage if you're dead, but the enhance build won't really line up in the reality of the game how you think it will.
---
The reason parrying is good is because it hastens your pending auto attack by either 30-40%, can't remember which. But the point is it's not super important if you're not a 2h spec and it's not going to be mitigating much damage either because you can't parry while you're casting, CC'd or if the hits are coming from behind. Being a caster minimizes the possible parry windows and you're not even able to utilize the main benefit of it.
---
So, if you swap that for Elemental Mastery (which yes is a rather sub par active especially as a 3m cooldown), all you're really left with is are some defensive stats, a lil mana and the ghost wolf cast time. The ghost wolf thing isn't going to be as impactful as you might think, you're going to find that often it's more important that you continue to expend damage than it is to try and utilize that to kite. If it were like druid's where it also breaks slows/roots (in addition to actually being instant) that'd be a different story, but yeah. If a rogue/warrior are on you it's not going to do much, you would have to use it preemptively and that's rather cumbersome since it's not instant and one of those guys can literally just zoom at you every now and then, so. If you choose to fully flee instead of just trying to kite, it'd be ok for that since you could probably break away from a slowing guy with the marginal speed differential after frost shocking, but that's about it. That's the only other thing in the enhance tree you took that has much meaning, it should be pretty easy to see how all the other stuff isn't that important.
---
For resto, you took the mana cost reduction over healing wave cast time.. I understand the logic since elemental is a mana intensive spec, but 5% isn't really a lot unless heals account for the majority of your casts (like in PvE healing). Also, since you can't feasibly get both the healing-cast knockback resistance and all the DPS talents, that -0.5s from healing wave's cast time is going to be a lot more important. I agree with how you distributed the points otherwise though, except for that one in imp Reincarnate. I'd probably put that in -1% heal cost instead just because I favor anything not tethered to ultra-long cooldowns, but I guess it doesn't really matter.
---
Also fire nova totem is good. I'd take points out of Elemental Warding because it's only particularly useful against, like.. mages, other elemental shaman and caster druids. If it were all spell damage like that Holy priest talent, that'd be one thing, but it's pretty specialized.
---
What I'd do: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0kVfMqZZt0ez0xo
---
What?
---
Deep aff drain lock's succubus: What is my purpose?
---
Warlock: You're a mana potion
---
Succubus: Oh my god
---
Druid: Yeah welcome to the club
---
It really depends if you're solo or in a group, and whether you're on a PvP or PvE server. There's fundamentally no bad option
---
+ Night Elf: Shadowmeld → Mind Control (people into lava at BRM)
---
+ Human: Perception ruins the day for any Rogues/Druids trying to sneak up on you (granted you have to have an idea someone is trying to do so).
---
+ Dwarf: Stoneform (and Dwarf Priest specific skills) are a strong contender.
---
You mean to say the staff and gloves with mixed melee/caster stats *isn't* better? 
---
But I want to melee and flame shock Ragnaros.

You clearly haven't played BFA.
---
Valley of Trials is literally the tutorial zone, levels 1-5.  It's isolated in a corner of Durotar just like all starting zones except for Tauren.  This is a bad example.  At 60 you do still go through lots of zones, just obviously not the tutorial zone.
---
Yes, increasing the level cap lets new players catch up.  It also makes old content obsolete.  It is choosing one path over the other, and now people who aren't satisfied with modern WoW criticize this choice.  This is an opportunity to go in a different direction.
---
And the opposite is true with your point to raiding.  In BFA Blizzard expects everyone to raid.  It is made for everyone to have access to.  In Vanilla, Blizzard only expected a small percentage to raid.  They were actually surprised how many people ended up raiding.
---
Isn't that some shit browser game or something.
---
Vanilla scripts are crazy, you can do pretty much anything but move with them. Want to cancel cast? Use a script that spams max rank heal and auto cancels at .1sec before cast if target isn't below hp threshold. 
---
Thankfully they went with modern API or one button macros would run rampant.
---
Classic+ vs Classic TBC is an interesting debate. Both have their ups and downs. We can say with certainty that we must choose between them at some point, presumably around 2 years into Classic, when the population starts dwindling.
---
Like you’ve said, it’s possible to pick the best parts of TBC like arena’s and improved class balance. The danger lies in who does the picking. A voting system could work, but still isn’t perfect. People vote for selfish reasons. If 75% of the player base is only interested in PvE updates, that means the remaining 25% who are interested in other things could easily see the game turn into something that no longer interests them. It’s kinda what happened to retail: the PvE Raiding might be good, but everything else sucks. Leveling, professions, PvP have all been ground to meaningless pulp.
---
You seem to have a lot of trust in ‘game designers’ to make the right choices. There are some issues with this line of reasoning. First of all, the designers who created Vanilla are gone. The designers who work for modern Blizzard clearly have a different perspective of game design than those who created Vanilla, as is evidenced by the fact that Vanilla and retail are such vastly different games that the only thing they have in common is their name.
---
Modern designers, in my view, are simply not suited for creating Vanilla-like content. You might disagree, but I’ve certainly seen no evidence of the contrary. What I have seen, is a game that has increasingly moved away from the values that I believe make a game worth playing. Even in the creation of classic WoW, whenever the devs deviated from Vanilla, it was to make the game more like retail, not less (Layering/sharding, rightclick report, battle-net). This leads me to believe that a Classic+ project led by modern developers will slowly but inevitably lead to a more retail-like game. It doesn’t help that out of the hundreds of suggestions I’ve seen from the pro-changes community, every single one without exception aimed to make the game more convenient, more QoL, more homogenized, more retail-like. I’ve never seen someone suggest to make the game *more* brutal, more unforgiving, more imbalanced; more Vanilla like.
---
I could write an entire essay on the differences between Vanilla and retail, but I think most of us are well aware by now. The most important difference are:
---
Punishing mistakes (mobs are more dangerous, ress runs take longer)
---
Levels of handholding. Vanilla is full of inconvenience and it’s your responsibility to deal with it. This is why I personally don’t want layering. I would rather deal with the issue of overpopulation by finding alternative leveling routes.
---
Class balance. Vanilla classes actually feel like different classes rather than reskins of one of the four roles (MDPS, RDPS, Heal, Tank) which is what happened to retail. While Vanilla has imbalanced classes in a raiding environment, the balance in leveling and PvP is actually very interesting. Most competitive WSGs see either all or all but one classes represented by each faction. It’s just that when you put classes in a number output simulation spamming your 1 or 2 most efficient abilities for hours on end (which is what Classic raiding entails in a nutshell), there will stark differences. Yet this doesn’t show the dozens of interesting and class defining abilities available to each class. When your only purpose in game is reaching the top of Recount in 40 man raids (which is a retail mindset), sure, some classes are significantly better. 
---
In short, I disagree with the blind faith you put in modern devs. To say they gave us Vanilla is a disingenuous argument: most if those devs have left and they took their design mindset with them. Modern devs do not have a design philosophy compatible with classic, and even if they did, the KPI-minded managers at Blizzard will hamstring them in their freedom to produce content that hasn’t been calculated and sanitized down to the point of meaningless.

!remindme 38 days
---
desperate for daddys attention again? Need a friend to give you some positive attention as well i see.  
---
Its obvious why noone wants to buddy up with you.
---
That's definitely broken &lt;1.5s wands shoot &lt;1.5s
---
Technically both but it appears to the end of the human campaign leading into the undead one I think.
---
Honestly, dailies were ok back then, because they were new and people weren't already doing them for 10 years.  
---
Not everyone plays wow for PvP so for them flying is ok and resilience means they don't have to grind PvP for PvE (And that goes the opposite direction for strictly PvP people).  
---
Smaller raid size was what actually enabled a lot of people to raid with just a small group of friends, instead of 30+ strangers, not to mention lowered drama and logistic needs which usually burned out the small number of people that organised those big guilds.  
---
What I am just trying to say is that wow back in TBC was played by millions of players, and very, very big part of them didn't really see anything you mentioned as a negative. They could finally raid in smaller numbers, even 5 man content got more interesting/challenging with heroic modes. Even the PvPers got smaller sized content in arenas.   
---
It all allowed you to play with real friends, not "friends"
---
PvE this time for sure. I was on a PvE server from Vanilla to WoD and I always felt like I was missing out on the world PvP action because I like to kill **everyone**.
---
I would prefer a classic+ over classic TBC, in terms of getting new content and staying closer to the classic design style, but at the very least they need to eventually fix some of the completely broken specs. TBC balance was far from perfect, but a significantly higher number of specs were at the very least playable. Ret and Prot pallies became viable, Shadow priests became viable, etc. 
---
I don’t even care if they fix the specs that aren’t viable in the same manner they did in TBC or if they do something completely different, but I would like to see more than just a handful of specs be viable, if for no other reason than to shake things up.
---
&gt;It drains a random amount as a DoT each time you activate it but doesnt have a cooldown, so you can keep rerolling how much it does to you until it's an insignificant amount.
---
Damn, that's crazy.
---
If enough people demanded a Grim Batol dungeon, and Blizzard thought they could make money by making Grim Batol dungeon content, they would make it.  It's only impossible if you want it to be.
---
There are generally (stereotype) going to be two types of classic players
---
+ (1) Hardcore theory-crafting elitist know-it-alls
---
+ (2) Everyone else
---
In general, people in group (1) are going to burn out massively because they'll impose far too many limitations/restrictions on themselves
---
+ Must be optimal spec
---
+ Must have optimal consumables
---
+ Must blah blah blah
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Can you imagine how conflicted those sort of players (the pseudo-hardcore players, who rely on other people doing the theorycrafting instead of being able to do it on their own) will be when they see loot dropping in raids but because it's not on their 'BIS Lists' they don't want it, or hot gutted they will be when an item they want goes to someone else?
---
Regardless of your knowledge levels, you will enjoy the game a hell of a lot more if you don't get caught up in the (1) crowd.
---
I prefer ud shadow. Not because it has any benefits over the other races but because it fits the fantasy of this sinister caster who uses the shadow from the grave to consume the mind of the living.
---
Geez, this was edgy to say. I apologize for sounding so cringy
---
Isnt that the case for enhancement aswell? And for every class really? AQ40 and Naxx gear outperform all PvP gear. Even BWL gear starts outperforming some of the epic PvP gear.
---
Wait so you mean you can't use your auto attacks to hit enemies?
---
Why not?
---
Stamina was the original resilience.
---
I don't think they are considered mistakes because the game hasn't in principle deviated from them and classic WoW just fits nicely with the other reworks of classic titles like Star Craft and WCIII (I expect a rework of Lost Vikings in the near future too). So basically it will fit a niche.
---
I get that you don't like BFA, but my point is that these changes basically happened with BC (some, like the new talent builds even with the end of Classic) and to an even larger extent with WOTLK. It's the way the game has not only survived but been the top-title for 15 years in a market that is getting bigger and more competetive every year.
---
The only way Classic+ can happen is if Classic brings in a lot of new players, releasing TBC probably cost 5% of what a new expansion cost to make. Making new an expansion for classic would just double the total development cost of wow, and it's not going to happen without a lot of new players joining the game to pay for it.
---
It does not and unlike the Druid forms ghost wolf has a cast time.
---
God that was painful to read...
---
Since it's a trinket you can't equip it during an encounter. So it's only really usable for tanks in my opinion.
---
PvE. Not interessted in subjecting myself to all that useless ganking shit.
---
Not for all classes. The reason it's a thing for Shaman is because almost all their tier stuff is +healing. They get some decent +dmg gear from ZG, but compared to classes like Rogues and Locks, whose T2 gear is amazing for PvP dps, Shamans get kinda left behind, like all hybrids.
---
Tauren. Extra health plus a stun is heaps better than the axe spec, stun resistance and blood fury at that level.
---
Great post thanks for sharing, would be great to see some rogue items if anyone wants to add them :)))
---
Thanks. I'll analyse it :)
---
The quest item will be available (they changed on item to make it Ashenvale only). You could be (and it was one of the few alliance perks) Furbolg form enabled in any zone with a 3 min buff on a 1 min cd.
---
RemindMe! 36 Days
---
As a former GM/RL i can confirm that this is indeed is one of things that happens with groups pretty often, but usually it does not come out nowhere and you have some time to prepare for such situation, making it not as stressfull for the guild if you officers or RL pay attention to the situation. And if it does not happen groups are pretty nice to have in your raid setup because you can communicate with all of them trough one person and know if some of them will be late or wont be able to attend due to some unexpected circumstances.  
---
Also if i hear something like "if X does not come we wont come too", all of them will get to raid if i cant change them right now (as you said, i wont ruin raid for other people), but most probably it will be their last raid in this guild because it is straight up blackmail. And i will make sure their next guild master know the reason they were kicked. Its not that time consuming compared to what you have to keep track on already. Also i could say its not that difficult to change 5 people in 40-man raid, unless they are on key tank (MT/OT) positions. And it usually happens at early guild phases when your raid roster only starts forming so its not like people leaving will have full BWL BiS with trinkets or something.  
---
Its pretty easy to find some dedicated newbie if you really have an unfilled raid spot. Also guilds usually have spare DPS/healers because most people cant attend to raid 100% of times, and tanks are usually most reliable/trusted persons in the guild with some friendly connection to guild staff. Even raiding as 38 people is usually more acceptable than allowing blackmail from raid members. Because if you allow it once without any consequences shit will get out of hand pretty fast. You really have to be pretty strict to manage 40 people raiding.  
---
So yes, while it is for sure an unpleasant situation for guild master, its nowhere as bad as you may think. I also suggest people to not use blackmail as any argument because if some group of people, or single really well geared player from another guild will suddenly attend to my - its pretty common to ask former guild officers about reason their ways separated because it looks pretty suspicious.
---
Ah ok I couldnt remember
---
Last time i farmed in vanilla not on a private server i believe it was just the spellbinders and there was not enough of them it took a long time to farm. I could be wrong that was a long time ago.
---
Runescape was quite popular back during the early 2000's. During 2007 however, several controversial changes were made, changes to the main PvP area, in game trading, and the game began to decline. During 2012 however, it changed the combat mechanics, making it a fundamentally different game.
---
After this, Jagex (the company behind Runescape) asked the community if they would like an old version of the game that would exist in addition to the current game. The overwhelming response was a resounding yes, and they brought in a version from 2007 before those controversial changes I mentioned. This version was called Old School Runescape.
---
Since 2013 when it first launched, OSRS has received new original content, quality of life changes and improvements to the game. It is the more popular of the two versions, attracts players who never even played the original, and I believe actually has a larger player base than it ever had in the 2000's.
---
Partly agree. Hesitantly.
---
After all these years I'm not really convinced anymore that blizzard still know how to make it fun. Listening to the community over God designers is bad (usually).
---
But, to contradict myself. Dailies were bloody annoying.
---
But I guess it would be a nice experience. Although I doubt it would happen. Dumping that much dev and designer time into it might lure the attention of the executives to the game.
---
And nothing ruins games faster and more severely than attention from executives or shareholders.
---
World PvP had been dying since 1.5 and was certainly doomed once cross realm bgs were added. And 10 and 25 man raids saved more guilds than it killed. So much revisionist history from private server players who just parrot the same dumb shit talking points without any real discussion.
---
I swear, some of you would praise all the shit TBC changed about the game if it was introduced as in a 1.X patch.
---
No this was the beta AV test
---
2 jokes
---
Ehh you just have to worry about no druid trainers in durotar and tirisfal, no shaman &amp; hunter trainers in tirifal and no rogue &amp; warlock trainers in Mulgore (though there are priest and mage trainers in TB)
---
All the good stuff from TBC can be enjoyed from instant-70.
---
The bad shit- daily, seasonal PvP/PvE treadmill, rampant botting in BGs, dead world, heroics all start from TBC. The reason why everything past wotlk sucks is because the game can't sustain all those bad ideas.
---
They can launch a couple TBC classic servers to try to get some of the pserver crowd to come back and a couple classic people to continue, but classic expansions are a dead end with a hard limit at wotlk. 
---
Hell, they could have a classic+ already better than TBC just by adding arenas, karazhan, iqd, sunwell, etc to classic.
---
Wait wtf is this post about
---
0 IQ response.
---
Not saying that it is impossible to find one - just be sure to secure them before the launch. Find a raid guild before it starts, say you absolutely want to be the MT and will do what is necessary, and you're good.
---
There may be a druid trainer in Org though but I can't remember.
---
Yes, the fact that the game designers are a new breed at Blizzard is definitely a concern.  However, if there is an initiative to "do it differently than BFA", which is pretty much exactly what Classic is, I don't think it's fair to assume that the devs are completely incompetent.  They are competently making a game that you and I don't like, but many others do like.  They can competently make a game you and I would like.
---
One reassuring thing is when it comes down to it, this really isn't rocket science.  The reasoning against flying mounts is clear.  The reasoning against LFR is clear.  The reasoning behind including a realistic possibility of failure is clear.  These are things that don't fit the model of modern WoW, but it doesn't mean these are things that are difficult to implement if you had the chance to do it.
---
As far as enhance goes AQ40 have more bis gear than Naxx right? With the 5 piece set and 2handers.
---
In did wind up letting him die a number of times. He never learned his lesson
---
Great!
---
I think most people started playing during TBC, that's why.
---
Except that this is not 2006, nor 2008, when WoW was the behemot of MMOs, and everyone and their mom played WoW.
---
This is 2019. And in 2019, the "Classic" player base is dead split between TBC and Classic+. The support for Wrath is minuscule, to say the best. Today, to see the repeat of an increased player base for WoW, comes down to 2 big ass paths : Deliver a Retail WoW 9.0 that draws players...OR, deliver a Classic+ expansion that draws new players.
---
Re-releasing TBC and Wrath, will NOT get new players, it will LOSE players, because the Classic+ half of the player base does not want TBC and will NOT play TBC. And the TBC half does not and will NOT play Wrath.
---
It is a dead end, and it will end in Wrath with less than 10% of the player base at the END of Classic (not at release).
---
!= != =
---
Heroics were great.  What are you talking about?
---
Just take the money and keep playing private servers. With Classic coming out, private servers will be able to be nearly identical pretty soon.
---
Limited play time? Just go mage and be a winters chill bitch. Melee dps is more gear reliant, mages are the objectively best dps casters, and you won't be filling a niche hole full of scrutiny. People will always think "wouldn't they be more helpful as holy?" which mages are exempt from. Just get your consumes, and possibly a few world buffs and you're golden.
---
Yeah it was more just theory cause I value defensive talents on other classes...assumed it would be the same.  
---
I am a greedy bastard solo player when I PvP, so I landed on:  
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEczVcMqZZx0xx0xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEczVcMqZZx0xx0xo)   
---
Although I will probably float points out of Healing Focus as time goes on, into Totemic Mastery (for premades) and Nature's Guidance, if I need the hit.
---
You get good progress in PvE and then also get the control of the battlefield that frost mages can achieve - can't really melt faces or burn mana as a sheep.
---
how does shadow priest hold up in 5mans?
---
I'm not actually sure about Enhancement. They'd be better wearing Hunter off-set items like [Crown of Destruction](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18817) where they can, I'd think.
---
Don’t have larger melee range!
---
Is my post not an attempt to have a real discussion?  With regard to world PvP, I personally don't think Blizzard ever took it seriously.  And now it's become clear from interviews with many of the devs that worked on Vanilla that WoW was originally planned to not have any PvP at all.
---
Adding a system to the game encouraging world PvP would be great.  The silly little towers in TBC zones was not any solution to this.  Adding incentives to raiding / defending Orgrimmar would have been great, seeing how players would do that just for fun anyway.
---
Stop spreading our secrets!!
---
If you want to play a shadow priest human is kinda bad, you need 25 points in holy to get any real bonus from the 5% extra spirit. Both the night elf and dwarf racials have better synergy with shadow priests.
---
Most classes get better over time, ele shamans aren't on the radar until AQ40, that was his meaning, they suddenly come online when good pieces of gear are available for them.
---
Level 1-8 at least in Dun Morogh or Elwynn first so you don't have to go far for ability leveling then go back and start the elf quests from the level 1-5 area onwards.
---
They would if they added the good stuff without the bad. They can follow OSRS in that aspect. 
---
They don't need to fuck up again. There are clearly things about TBC that worked really well. You can strengthen moonkins and rets without leading to wrath moonkins and protret paladins in arenas and ret castrandom macros dealing within 90% dps of a playing ret paladin in wrath. They can have awesome arenas without turning BGs into a honor bot graveyard.
---
If Classic is successful, adding new Classic-like content instead of making Classic TBC (Burning Crusade expansion).
---
Any guild should be able to clear every content in the game, even naxx. There is no mythic or mythic+ and as such each raid is designed to be cleared by the average player. You need to find a non-hardcore raiding guild and they'll probably be totally fine with whatever you decide to bring.
---
So you gonna roll warrior? 
---
And every downtime during lvling do a few push ups so 10-20 then kill mobs again.
---
What is your morning routine for 30 min?
---
Why people are so butthurt that you pointed out the flaws of shadow priest is beyond me. People desperately want to pretend that you're telling them they can't do something which is not at all what this is. I know that because I'm an adult with a functioning brain and I'm able to read.
---
Paladin/shaman they seem to be built for it the Holy Paladin with some prot and consecrate as well as the time-tested 30/0/21 Shaman are very powerful in PvP since they're the most survival-oriented classes that can heal as well as pack a surprising punch in a pinch especially the ele/resto shaman lightning bolt &amp; chain lightning burst.
---
I used to be fairly active on the realms community page and had a good standing with a horde guild after I posted a series of screenshots where some friends and I corpse camped a high profile ninjalooter/scammer for an hour or so.
---
So one day I ran into Orgrimmar and made it to the bank roof before being slain by the guards. No biggie, I had no armor on and soulstone. So i ressurected and just stood there greeting hordes. Some of the guys recognized me and decided not only to let me live, but activley keep me alive. Every time someone tried to kill me, they would Mind Control and heal me back up to 100%. I was there for maybe 20-30 mins before I got bored and HSed out.
---
Was going to add an image of this, but photobucket is sloooooooow. Are they hosting their servers on a dial-up in rural Alaska or something?
---
Nuking the fuck out of a reskinned leveling dungeon in gear that would let a rogue tank it once a day like a job for badges was great?
---
Pvp this time around. I played pve in vanilla and was happy about it. Getting ganked would probably have made me quit back then. 
---
But I have played vanilla so classic will just be a repeat. It matters less this time around. 
---
I want to add that danger as another dimension this time around.
---
I mean, my comment wasn't aimed at you. Though I disagree with what you said, at least you explained your opinions rather than this guy.
---
Here's the thing, I love the concept of Classic+. I don't trust anyone in a decision making position at Blizzard though. TBC is by far the simplest solution to the "what after Naxx" question, however if developers were to release some list of design philosophies they promise to stick to while creating new Classic content, then that would sway me. Otherwise I just can't trust them.
---
A shame really. Addon makers are as rare as tanks. Anyone willing to make one should be given all the tools and access available.
---
In regards to that third point, there's no reason that Classic+ couldn't contain improvements to PvP, additional professionz or even adding additional leveling content like zones or dungeons.
---
Oml :/ alright imma have to fix this
---
Came here for this. Seems like it's true even for classic wow.
---
also the sale value seems a bit extreme
---
time.. AND skilled labor .. both of which get in the way of quick and massive profits
---
Cheers lads
---
I agree.  In order for Classic+ to happen you need Classic to be a financial success, and you also need the player base to make it clear they don't want Classic TBC.
---
I'm already assuming the first thing will happen.  I'm only worried about the second thing.
---
crossing the barrens level 1 is a bitch, but nothing compared to the wetlands. So yeah, Horde is pretty trivial.
---
In Vanilla, abandoning quest items would not remove the quest (and vice versa). I'm not sure about Classic release though, I heard it will be like retail (hence the quest and items being connected)
---
The 1.12 client
---
That's why I play female trolls for any class that allows it. 
---
Plus they have the best racials.
---
&gt; The world keeps getting smaller. Once an expansion comes out, there's very little reason to go back to previous content.
---
This is fairly irrelevant. Classic Vanilla will still be there, and a majority of players will probably still prefer that. No content is "lost" by adding TBC servers. It doesn't matter that people on TBC servers won't be doing the vanilla content. That's like saying the second course of a meal is harmful because some people won't want to eat their fill on the first course.
---
&gt; Player interaction has been minimized.
---
So what? Honestly, that's not a reason to be against TBC. You know what vanilla minimizes? Raid accessibility, competitive PvP participation and all the other things that were particularly arduous in vanilla. Every chapter of WoW does one thing better and another thing worse. Listing the things that TBC did worse than vanilla is not a reason to be against TBC servers. For everything TBC is worse at, there's something else it does better.
---
&gt; All the classes are far more similar to each other than they've ever been.
---
"Than they've ever been" is kind of a weird phrase to use when we're talking about the *second chapter* of WoW. Almost everything in TBC is more x than it's ever been. The level cap is higher. The stats on items are higher. The mobs hit harder. Classes are nowhere near as homogenized as they become later on. You vastly exaggerate the extent to which "every class can do everything." You're really reaching to come up with reasons TBC is bad.
---
&gt; The game feels repetitive. Log in, do the thing, log out.
---
Precisely like vanilla really, except there's an incentive to continue PvPing seriously even after you've reached your goal rank. Dungeons and raiding are functionally the same, TBC isn't any more repetitive than vanilla. Less so, to be honest, given that you don't truly run out of anything to do in TBC thanks to vanilla, heroic badges, etc.
---
So sure, TBC was the first step toward what we don't like about modern WoW, but it was step one of ten and it was still fine. It was the most consistently popular period in WoW, enjoying high player numbers throughout and lacking any major community-wide complaints like we saw in WotLK. It was just so far from being the horrible disaster that you want it to be. The game was streamlined a little but was still close to its MMORPG roots.
---
But most importantly, **you can just fucking choose not to play TBC.** Blizzard is never going to forcibly transfer your characters to TBC realms, or shut down their vanilla realms if TBC comes out. It's just such an irrational, unintelligent fear to have. You can simply play vanilla and never worry about TBC. Think about what you're trying to do here--you're **campaigning to prevent something that has literally no effect on you from happening, just because you don't intend to participate in it.** That kind of makes you a piece of shit.

Assuming optimal healer specs:
---
A:
---
0/20/31 Deep Resto with Feral Druid:  Furor, blood frenzy and imp shred and feral gear + power-shifting, especially if they go farm manual crowd pummeler
---
C:
---
31/20/0 or 31/0/20 Power infusion Priest: 31/20/0 will have better personal damage with smite but shadow weaving spec will increase raid dps more. Normally you would cast rank 1 mind blast between heals to keep shadow weaving up
---
24/0/27 moonglow/regrowth Druid you are only missing 10% base damage on spells and 3% crit from moonkin
---
31/11/8 or 31/0/20  Paladin ret tree is meh anyway, at least you have holy shock for damage, B tier vs undead
---
D:
---
20/0/31"Caster" Shaman missing core elemental talents
---
F:
---
0/20/31 "Melee" Shaman missing stormstrike
---
Yeah totemic mastery is *ok* if you're not trying to fill in the knockback resistance because it might save you some mana sometimes even by yourself since you may not have to recast totems because of it, but that's kind of a stretch.
---
If you go without the hit talent, I'd definitely recommend you research your items and be sure to target a couple of items with it. You only need 3% for the level 60 PvP hit cap.
---
May be kind of up in the air which would be better. Healing Focus isn't supremely important because of Eye of the Storm but it's not useless.
---
Oh I know that BFA fans and the modern WoW dev team don't think they were mistakes (except for flying mounts, I really think the devs wish they never put them in the game because taking them out suddenly would be a disaster).
---
I'm saying the Classic WoW player thinks these things were mistakes.  I could link you to tons of people saying this but I think you already know what I'm talking about.
---
They never said they were straight. Did you just assume his sexuality?
---
Yeah, I feel like most of the problems end at heroic.
---
do you know who this was and have links ? very interested in it
---
The canon is that we the players are travelled back in time before the future happens at all. The future is therefore invalid to the world of WoW Classic.
---
Just one note: You mention class homogenization starting. I disagree heavily.
---
Every single class was unique in Vanilla, but you couldn't play a good bunch of specs outside of maybe PVP and even then you're better off playing a different spec than balance druid e.g.
---
TBC just gave every single spec *something* that made them actually decent. They didn't give Shamans CC for example; They just gave Elemental and Enhancement ways to not go OOM after clicking one of the buttons in their UI by accident. (Overexaggerating I know.)
---
It also gave several classes an actual rotation/spell priority to play around with. Having warlocks be these DoT Pet casters who're supposed to never use their DoTs is silly IMO, and I'm not a fan of how the 8 debuff limit was a thing for so long and also not a fan of DS being so powerful that spamming shadowbolt became the defacto playstyle for TBC warlocks later on either.
---
TBC Class design was great. Classes recieved logical additions for the most part (except warriors. Hey, let's nerf rage so that you can spec into getting more rage again to neutralize that... What the?) and I for one would love most things from Classic to stay as they are but have TBC's class and also encounter design bleed into Classic.
---
Dungeons from 15 to 50 barely offer any mechanics, classes have all these cool situational abilities which they keep in TBC but they actually get to use some of them more often, hybrids fully embrace their support-but-also-okay-ish-DPS role which I really like, it had its upsides.
---
Not a fan of flying, the smaller world, dailies and the like though. 100% with you there. I'd love to see a Classic+ as well, but I'll definetly also enjoy a TBC Classic.
---
PvP definetely. Non consensual Open World PvP is a major part of the game.
---
I had more fun in level 1-5 and level 1-15 of the beta stress tests than I have in the last 10 years of retail WoW.  Retail is just going through the motions, it's a hollow shell.  vanilla was a challenge from the moment you attacked that first enemy.
---
Heroic dungeons were awesome.  Badges were too
---
I literally think the solution is to just make everyone watch those BlizzCon 2005 videos I linked to.  It's like getting a glimpse into an alternate reality that could have been.
---
Dont eat yellow snow
---
I still don't get it.. So it's mainly for PvP sacking right? I see no real use in PvE for it...?
---
Incorrect. A "band of adventurers did" as was the case lorewise all the way up until around MoP/WoD where it soon became the "Champion of Azeroth" instead.
---
My philosophy is bring the player, not the class. I will raid as arms warrior.
---
It's viable with a good, coordinated group who know what they're doing.
---
On the other hand, Classic+ could either gain new players or lose a large majority of the old ones. If done correctly, the game could grow beyond the initial crowd who plays Classic, and even the people who want TBC would probably play Classic+ so long as it is good. If done incorrectly however, the game would die, neither the TBC nor the Classic+ people would enjoy it.
---
Rereleasing TBC doesn't interest me and so the game would essentially die there for me. I'd much rather see some imagination and fresh content than watch it slowly trundle towards Wrath like an old man with Alzheimer's.
---
SO much this!
---
The story isn't shoved in your face either.  It's there if you want to dig but Sylvanas never leaves Undercity and the game is so much better for it.
---
\#1 has been playing the same game for the last 10 years on private servers, starting fresh every single time they shut down a server or start a fresh server when one comes out to do the same thing over and over, in what fairy land where you are from, does the burn out happen?
---
In general, #2 on reddit like to tell others how to play and have fun, just like how blizzard does to its retail players.
---
Cant play without that wotf or orc stun resist can they..
---
Will all those quasi-secret places like the Caverns of Time, Hyjal, the Ironforge airport, Quel'thalas, the "Outland" area in the Deadlines, etc. still be accessable to explore? Or will Blizzard "fix" the terrain so you can't get there anymore?
---
Im a rep grinder. And did all the grinds as a priest. Back in the day that was painful.  Now its been a few years since i did timbermaw to exalted.  But if i retail correctly that took me 2 months with some 3-4 hours evening grinds i felwood mostly. 
---
If you just need honored, after all quest and (save the totem!) You can do it in a week i would say.  My biggest mistake was not grouping with someone. You might have to share the necks,  but killing speed will be faster.  Also go human if possible at exalted its 4200 rep difference from other races.
---
As warlock: Use pots/demonic runes off global cooldown, once you gotta move use lifetap so you don't waste GCDs spamming Shadowbolt.
---
Sylvanas as a pale banshee elf, Jaina in an alliance quest chain that got finished in TBC so it just ends with her, Saurfang is in Org, Baine is in Bloodhoof Village, Thrall is Warchief, Voljin is alive and nearby Thrall, Garrosh is in Outland at this time and we don't see him or know he exists until TBC and Chen is only referred to through a quest in the Barrens
---
I'm rolling horde, so human is not possible. And you say I can do it in a week, that's with how many hours each night?
---
Because of the launch times,  in the US it's daytime and for EU its midnight or 11pm for UK so naturally there will be less players for launch on EU side compared to US
---
It's max attack speed increase is actually 43%
---
Of course it will. If Blizz does classic TBC then the fanbase will want every expansion remade and the community will be splintered. 
---
If we go ahead and do Classic TBC all of the problems the community has with modern WoW will repeat.
---
This is the kind of shit is better than coffee in the morning.
---
Is anyone else other than me excited to visit the park in stormwind again?
---
I agree with you that Classic Wrath will be a disaster, with all the same problems and a fraction of its original player base, and that's a part of the reason I made this post in the first place.
---
With regard to it not being 2006, it sounds like you are saying that there isn't an audience for a good old-fashioned MMORPG.  I disagree, and I'd point to games being made right now like Camelot Unchained and Pantheon that are literally trying to capture that market of dissatisfied MMORPG player.
---
At the end of the day the argument here is to make the same type of game that made Vanilla WoW the king that it was.  And TBC was a small deviation from that vision that eventually led to where we are now.
---
Thanks for the reply, very helpful getting info that is reliable. 
---
 Certainly sounds doable getting exalted with a different faction but will it be worth it that is the question? Without planing for exalted rep you have total freedom, can grind and switch areas as you wish. Exalted planed and you need to quest and prepare for cloth turn in as well even though with your info it looks like it will be less cloth needed.
---
 One factor as well for me is I had planed to go mining. Easier to level it up in the Ironforge zones. Guess still have a month to think about it.
---
You'd make more gold in like 20 mins at 60 than all the time you spend gathering 1-50
---
Vendorstike Not even worth a nexus crystal
---
\#1. World pvp died outside of raid entrances after BG's got released.
---
\#2. Gave you something to actively do outside of the normal grind
---
\#3. Every guild in vanilla carried dead weight, if anything trimming the fat is a net positive with a better guild.
---
\#4. Like every main city of that faction in vanilla...
---
\#5. Fair
---
\#6. Resilience was fine, you got pvp gear for pvp instead of pve'ing for it... overtuned at some points of BC for sure
---
Man, Dwarf priest's everywhere now
---
I feel you i was expecting maybe 40 upvotes at most
---
So why are you even asking then question if you know we are starting in 1.12?
---
Most people tend to forget that Blizzard-Activision is the main actor and the decision factor in this Classic+ vs TBC debacle.
---
If you were to be the head of WoW design team, what will you do if Classic WoW is hugely popular?
---
You will gather your team, and the discussion will be like this :
---
"Yo, dudes, Classic is huge, what can we do in the future to benefit from this?"
---
"Well, Chief, we got some options."
---
"All right, spill it out !"
---
"Chief, there is this low investment, high profit TBC re-release after Classic"
---
"Cool, for how long can we "milk" this TBC?"
---
"Well, Chief, for about 2 years"
---
"C'mon dudes, I did not hired you to come with short term solution. This is a big company, we work long term. Come up with a LONG term financial solution that benefits this company"
---
"But, Chief, there is also Wrath after TBC, which gives us 2 more years"
---
"Great ! 6 years is more like it. How is the support data for this TBC and Wrath?"
---
"Chief, the data is not encouraging at all. 40% the player base wants a so-called Classic+ expansions and refuse to play TBC, 40% wants TBC and refuse to play Wrath, and 20% want Wrath"
---
"Well than dudes, we have a problem on our hands. If we deliver TBC, we lose 40% of the players base, hence, income. For 2 years of TBC we will make only 60% of the Classic income, and for the following 2 years of Wrath, only about 20%. That is NOT something I wanted to hear from you. Tell me more about this Classic+ expansions".
---
"Chief, we avoided this subject, because it means high investment for unknown profits. Re-releasing TBC and Wrath is very cheap, and still bring in some profits. Classic+ is a big financial effort, and we don't know if it will get the intended revenue"
---
"Well, dudes, this is why I am the Chief, and you aren't. If we can design these Classic+ expansions preserving the old school MMORPG game design philosophy, we will get a LONG TERM steady or even increasing revenue flow, for at least 10 years. I understand that it is a big investment, but if we do it right, avoiding the stupid mistakes we did in the past, we will have solid revenue, long term. 
---
With high risk, comes high reward. If we sit on our asses and just deliver TBC and Wrath, in 6 years is over. Almost NOBODY will PAY, again, for the same crap. They did it ONCE, back in 2006-2010, they will do it AGAIN, from 2022-2026...They won't do yer for the third time. Not unless the Fortnite and LoA player base is moving to WoW, which won't happen, ever.
---
I cannot come up in front of my boss and present him a rehashed, short term, low income solution, like this TBC and Wrath, and expect a path on the back, regardless of the low investment. We cannot RECYCLE everything again. I rather present him the Classic+ expansions solution, even if it's a high investment, but the potential is HUGE, if we do right."
---
Players need to understand that 2019 is not 2006. A re-release of TBC and Wrath is appealing to only 60% (probably less) of the CURRENT Classic player base. The other 40% wants Classic+ expansions. TBC and Wrath are 4 years of content. AND THAT IS IT. Dreaming about re-releasing the same Classic+TBC+Wrath every 6 years is beyond stupid. Almost nobody will be play it for the THIRD TIME.
---
The only long term solution is Classic+. And it will bring in much more players than re-releasing TBC and Wrath will ever will.
---
Classic is and will be a museum in WoW. But, if it's hugely popular (and it will be) Blizzard cannot simply IGNORE the potential revenues of Classic+ expansion.
---
A permanent Classic will be a museum...and like a museum these days, it will be EMPTY in under 3 years from release. TBC and Wrath will have less players than Classic, and will last for 4 years only.
---
Repeating the cycle will not attract any new players OR any old players, that already played this cycle 2 or 3 times. It will be as empty in 4 years as Classic in 2 years.
---
Like it or not, the decision belong to Blizzard-Activision. And they will decide for a LONG TERM solution. And, again, like it or not, the LONG TERM solution is Classic+ expansions.
---
Whether they will FAIL or NOT, it's ANOTHER topic.
---
But I bet my entire savings that they will TRY to do it RIGHT, because it's their INVESTMENT and their PROFITS.
---
And if comes to the WORSE, and they FAIL...they can always back it up with TBC and Wrath, and start working again on Classic+. Or WoW2. 
---
Whatever it is, Classic+ is 100% SURE, because it is the LONG TERM solution. And that can become the WoW2 or the precursor to WoW2...which is, AGAIN, a LONG TERM solution.
---
TBC and Wrath are NOT. And this is why Blizzard-Activision doesn't consider them as development solution, but only back-up solution, in case they fail with Classic+.
---
Kinda depends. When you mana burn someone, you're effectively accomplishing nothing whatsoever until the target is actually out of mana. That takes quite a few casts unless they were already low to begin with. So unless you actually expect to be able to fully drain them, it's pretty much a waste of your time. 
---
It can work against healers because any mana you drain from them is mana that doesn't go into heals, but almost nobody plays resto shaman in PvP. And since an elemental shaman can kill you really quickly, spending time mana-burning him is kind of a bad strategy. Most of the time there's something more useful you can do with your globals.
---
If it's 1v1, there's no way you run him OOM before he kills you and it would be more efficient to counter his damage with healing. If it's group PvP, you're probably also helping more by staying in the back and healing. Mana burn is kind of overrated unless you specifically plan to win an attrition fight by running the opponent out of mana, and that's normally only possible against classes that don't do a lot of damage.
---
Forsaken will be female(I dont like how easy it is to see you don't have legs and only feet as a forsaken male wearing  robe, Tauren will be male because femtaur animations are weird as hell and I'm still flip-flopping for my orc who will be my main.
---
!remindme 37 days
---
Lol you want me to win world strongman 2020 ? :P
---
Nope, but you can't be sapped in ghost wolf, or anything else that targets only humanoids (Repentence?)
---
The dartols rod, do not abandon the quest. it will delete the item. As soon as you get the item, do not finish the quest.
---
You get argent dawn rep from strat UD trash til revered so its barely a grind. Should get it in no time from a few baron runs.
---
Everything you quoted me saying was from me describing BFA.  I later argued that those problems BEGAN with TBC.
---
Telling me to not play TBC is not a valid choice, because I don't want to play Classic Vanilla forever.  The assumption here is that Blizzard will have to choose between Classic TBC and Classic+.  If you get one, you don't get the other.  That is why I am against classic TBC, when we could have a much better game instead.
---
Crushy!!!
---
Sorry, I took my lesson. In other post I got explained how should I write. Pause = .  / ... = abomination:P
---
Oh you mean Ner'Zhul who was a Shaman / Warlock until he died? 
---
There's no point arguing, it's been 15 years ago. They tried to make necro, it didn't work out and they dumped the 1 tree they had finished into Warlock and called it Affliction.
---
Bullshit. Best leveling talent is Spirit Tap. Shadow tree is also filled with talents that increase damage.
---
Correct Shadow rotation melts mobs and you almost never run oom with spirit heavy gear. Holy is trash compared to that.
---
It depends on your class and role. 
---
Also depends if the spot(s) are occupied. Only 2 spots. 
---
If you got the spot to yourself, are a hunter. You can do it in less than a week.  But it gets really boring quickly. I usually didnt do more than 3-4 hours at a time.
---
Either an Orc lock, Forsaken Priest and Tauren warrior or a Forsaken Lock, Orc Shaman and Tauren warrior. Hard to decide lol
---
I'm possibly leaning towards a paladin as my first char with the end goal becoming a healer. Now while levelling I'm hoping to fill 2 rolls to do dungeons (heal and tank), after reading the advice on here with the correct build it is possible. Now to cut to the chase, what seals do I use to level/grind with? Do I judge with crusader then use righteousness until the mob is dead, then rinse and repeat? Ive never levelled a paladin in vanilla past 20ish so even if I'm correct in those seals, what should I be using at a higher level for both tank and heal?  
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Joana is developing one
---
I believe that TBC improved on Vanilla in every way.
---
Guild banks: even the no changers here have to admit that is a good addition.
---
Summoning stones: we want to do WC  but our heals is in Silverpine Forest, even though we are all at the entrance lets wait 30 mins for him to run over here.
---
Itemization: I don't remember many warriors in leather in TBC
---
Vanilla "meme" specs suddenly became more viable which I see as another improvement.
---
Heroic Dungeons: for those of us without time to raid this is as good as it gets and you receive nice rewards for challenging content.
---
I enjoy dailies: I like to max out rep while earning gold not only to buy flying (which I also like), but so I have enough gold to have all the items/enchants/gems for my main and to pimp out my alts while leveling them.
---
Flying did not kill world pvp: I play on a private TBC server and plenty of cash shop geared alliance land on my head to smash me to dust while I'm leveling (fun!).
---
And please don't give me this crap about "Classic TBC absolutely leads to  Classic BFA", its like when people say "you can't have guild banks in classic, because then you're going to end up with transmog and LFR". It's pretty ridiculous.
---
Honestly, when I read these anti TBC posts, it reminds me of the old "Wall of No" that was posted in the wow forums whenever someone asked about legacy servers. You vanilla lovers are finally getting what you wanted and I am really happy for you. I am excited to play classic as well since it might be the closest I get to official classic TBC. Comparing xpacs is a fine thing when you are stating facts, TBC added flying or Wrath added LFG, if these changes are good or bad is entirely subjective and it really comes down to personal preference.  There is no reason you can offer that will convince me that Vanilla is better than TBC, the same way there is no reason I could use to convince someone who loved Wrath that TBC is better. People like what they like. If you don't like TBC, thats great. I respect your opinion, but why should that mean that us TBC lovers shouldn't get what we desire?
---
So many alternatives so I can't chose. Impossible
---
It's not like all those devs just up and quit, and a new came in after those videos. I've seen them, they're great, but let's be honest, most all of those devs worked on TBC too. People forget that a lot of changes were planned for classes that were completely pushed back and focused on being part of the TBC release (Shaman Bus). TBC isn't some expansion created by different devs who gave up on Vanilla, it's a continuation of the same love child.
---
We can all look back at individual expansions and say "yea that was definitely a mistake" or "wow, that was an awesome concept, why did we lose that",  but that's what the power of hindsight is. But that's what "warts and all" means. We have to accept the good with the bad. Classic was advertised as a museum of sorts, not some redo at a past life.
---
However we have a completely new beast at the helm. Actiblizz only cares about ROI in order to report back to shareholders. I don't trust them currently, and even if they were forced to watch that video, I still wouldn't trust them as far as a could throw them.
---
Classic, then Classic TBC with rolling fresh Classic servers is honestly the only thing I trust Blizzard with.
---
Honored with Timbermaw is easy if it worked like it did on a private server( Kronos) I played on. What I did is start the grind in the 40:s, southern Felwood there are camps. So you grind the rep and get exp same time. Then you switch to northern part of Felwood in high 40:s. I don't remember exactly how the rep turn in worked but I think the idea was to save all rep turn in items and don't turn them in until you hit a certain rep in order to get maximum gain.
---
 For Argent Dawn it was the same thing pretty much. I started grinding it in the low 50:s, the western plaguelands fields. So rep grind and exp same time. Trick here was to not do a single Argent Dawn quest until you had grinded mobs to hit a certain rep( once again don't remember the threshold). Reason being the normal mobs stops giving rep at a certain point. So you grind the mobs until you hit that. Save all rep turn in items until the mobs stop giving rep. After that you can start doing Argent Dawn quests. Revered should honestly be pretty easy with some planing. 
---
 Should add that the biggest obstacle grinding these reps are the other faction. I played horde when I did the grind and at least on the server I played on Horde owned Felwood. Would be very tricky for an alliance player to start grinding southern Felwood for example. Was just swarming with Horde.
---
It also takes time to evaluate the success of classic and it probably takes around 2 years of development time to make a wow expansion, the lifespan of vanilla was only around 2 years. Even if they plan for classic to have a slightly longer lifespan they would still need to start development of the next expansion shortly after the launch of classic, and I don't think that will happen without some kind of guarantee that classic is a success. There would need to be millions of new players joining the game, not just players switching from retail to classic, and that could happen I just don't think that is the most like scenario.
---
That might not be the case for every server.  One server can be elitist with people running around at 60 within a week. One server may have a small amount of good pserver players and streamers. Therefore, that server might be much slower in progression, then on a populated server with grizzly etc guilds and streamers
---
A rare male troll animation lover - nothing but respect for troll mages who break up the monotony of all those male forsaken mages with blue hair.
---
Cartoony yes and thats exactly what Im talking about, kids shows switched to 3d animation many years ago and thats the style that both retail and fortnite are going for.
---
If you compare proportions n sillouettes aswell as textures from various stages of wow youd understand what Im talking about.
---
She does when me and the boys go in through the sewers and wreck her shit.
---
The release of Classic TBC would have an effect on the Classic+ crowd though - it would essentially end any possibility of Classic+. I think a lot of the Classic+ people have different ideas about what they would want to see added to the game, but there are a couple common things that they don't want to see, such as flying mounts and raising the level cap (which makes every 60 raid obsolete). 
---
If TBC is released, there is no more new content for them. If we went the way of Classic+ and it worked however, it would lead to fresh content in the spirit of Classic WoW. I think even the TBC crowd could enjoy it.
---
Regardless, if TBC is released, it is almost certain that we will get no Classic+ content. Similarly, if we see Classic+ content, there will (most likely) be no TBC. The game goes one way or the other, it does have an effect on people who choose not to play TBC.
---
&gt; On the other hand, Classic+ could either gain new players or lose a large majority of the old ones. If done correctly, the game could grow beyond the initial crowd who plays Classic, and even the people who want TBC would probably play Classic+ so long as it is good 
---
True. And this is WHY we will get Classic+. Blizzard will deliver it, and as anyone who builds anything, they try to do it right and assume that they did it right after they finished.
---
NOBODY knows how successful a product will be BEFORE they design/build it and sell it.
---
You can't assume that they will FAIL, the same way you can't assume that they will SUCCEED.
---
What you do know, is that if done RIGHT, it will be a massive success.
---
Nobody, ever, except crazy people, start something with the intent of FAILING. Everyone starts something with the intent of SUCCEEDING.
---
Let's be NORMAL in our heads and assume that Blizzard at least will work on Classic+ with the intent of SUCCEEDING.
---
If they do succeed, or not...it is something to be seen. We can't just say that they will 100% fail or 100% succeed even before they started working on a Classic+ expansion.
---
Not if that effort and attitude amounts to dps on par with a tank. Then I’d rather bring a douchebag, but one playing a good spec.
---
GotW, the best offtanking (2nd tank specifically) ingame, Faerie Fire, excellent flexing if specced for it (either tank -&gt; healer or tank -&gt; dps), Innervate. They’re all pretty solid points in favor of druids.
---
Its bfa 8.0.1 client. If it wasn't accessable in bfa. Then it won't be in classic most likely
---
My favourite Tauren druid is following,
---
Race: Tauren
---
Gender: Gnome
---
Class: Shaman
---
You can use crusader then righeousness, but at higher levels you might want to try judging light or wisdom and then righteousness for increased sustain.
---
There may be value in having a noticeboard style static page to recruit that just directs people to your discord and has a few screenshots, but having a forum/DKP tracking is entirely pointless when you can do it with Discord and spreadsheets IMO.
---
Your Mrs will learn to appreciate PvP realm gameplay.
---
Are there any reputations with useful (as opposed to just cosmetic) non-recipe rewards that you can start to grind pre 60 except for timbermaw and hydraxis?
---
Was Heroic Leap and Victory Rush in WOTLK?  I could have sworn it was TBC.  Either way, one led to the other lol.

I can't remember all the abilities from TBC, but I definitely remember mages getting the water elemental pet.  This is actually a super interesting one, because the devs specifically said during vanilla they DID NOT want mages having water elementals in order to separate them from warlocks and hunters.  Then TBC comes along and water elementals are in.  The class homogenization did begin in TBC, albeit not as bad as it is now.
---
Would probably require an audiobook or something similar:)
---
What do you all think is the best two beginner zones(lvl 1-20) to get a new player to be more likely to want to play further? My girlfriend agreed to try Classic out and I want to do this right.

He was literally the first Lich King you moron.

Bfd quests and probably some wpl/epl quests give AD rep?

OMG guys... where is humor in this post??? I was clearly joking... \~\~
---
Exactly. It's a two way thing. When she's off in the week she offers me the same respect. He'll grow out of the angst eventually!
---
You are forgetting one thing:
---
Blizzard will 100% make the same mistakes in Classic+ as they have REPEATEDLY made over the last 5 expansions.. because they refuse to admit that they are mistakes, regardless of what the player base says. Re-releasing classic isn't admitting that mistakes were made, its Blizz giving themselves a pat on the back for making a game so beloved that people want to play it 15 years later. Blizz will never release a "classic+" because its admitting their faults (something they never have and never will do). And even if they did do classic+, it would certainly be riddled with the same stuff that made expansions like WoD so god awful. Blizzard doesn't learn from their mistakes, classic trilogy or bust.
---
Please Blizzard: don't fuck up the game we love AGAIN!
---
Does AD have any useful non-profession rewards tho?
---
From what I can see OP rambles about two(three?) different things pretending they're related when they're not really related.
---
This isn't toxic? Lol
---
Unrestricted/Consequenceless open world PvP is a meme.
---
Burned out? You mean casual cleansing?
---
 Honored with Timbermaw is easy if it worked like it did on a private server I played on. What I did is start the grind in the 40:s, southern Felwood there are camps. So you grind the rep early and get exp same time( team up with one other player, rep doesn't diminish in a party). Then you switch to northern part of Felwood in high 40:s. I don't remember exactly how the rep turn in worked but I think the idea was to save all rep turn in items and don't turn them in until you hit a certain rep in order to get maximum gain.
---
For Argent Dawn it was the same thing pretty much. I started grinding it in the low 50:s, the western plaguelands fields. So rep grind and exp same time. Trick here was to not do a single Argent Dawn quest until you had grinded mobs to hit a certain rep( once again don't remember the threshold). Reason being the normal mobs stops giving rep at a certain point. So you grind the mobs until you hit that. Save all rep turn in items until the mobs stop giving rep. After that you can start doing Argent Dawn quests and turn ins. Revered should honestly be pretty easy with some planing.
---
Should add that the biggest obstacle grinding these reps are the other faction if you play on a PvP server. I played horde when I did the grind and at least on the server I played on Horde owned Felwood. Would be very tricky for an alliance player to start grinding southern Felwood for example. Was just swarming with Horde.
---
You would need to play Balance druid for that.

So if we ignore all the drops from the mobs and go by just kill count; 5 rep per mob, going from Unfriendly(3000), Neutral(3000), Friendly (6000) to Honored for total of 12000 reputation. 2400 mobs at pace of 1 mob every 30 seconds is 20 hours of nonstop grind.

Bfa has a completely different map, which is the main reason they are not accessible, not the client.

Its not bullshit. 
---
Both specs are comparable in throughput and efficiency. A lot of the shadow talents from 20 - 40 are more utility and pvp focused.
---
Night elf zones got that really nice atmosphere and the area from 10+ and onwards is quite nice too. It's got some really nice colors as well, and in case she wants to progress further you have Ashenvale and BFD real close to advance to. In case she survives that and wants to advance, she's already lured in and you can take her anywhere in the world to show some really cool, and quite opposite kind of zones than the pretty NE zones.

Idk why you're being downvoted. They literally call it communism and rally against it. It's terrible.
---
Regarding starting zones, question about the ease of leveling mining. If we don't take into consideration overpopulation is there a big difference betwen Elwynn/Westfall/Redridge/Duskwood compared to Dun Morogh/Loch Modan and Wetlands? 
---
 Haven't played much Alliance. I assume the dwarf areas will have more mining nodes? If layering doesn't sort out the overpopulation I guess the dwarf areas will be the way to go if you are a miner?
---
You caught me. No way was I in a naxx guild during OG WoW times. Clearly revisionist history.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cfxkj6/your_age_is_now_your_level_where_are_you_leveling/). 
---
For 2 years only. THAT IS IT.
---
Do you see Blizzard-Activision plan something for 2 years only? Because I don't. They plan long term.
---
TBC is not long term. It's 2 years, and it's over in 2 years. Than what? Wrath? Wrath player base is a fraction of Classic and TBC player base.
---
So...what? Re-releasing Classic and TBC every 4 years? NOBODY sane will ever do that.
---
The only long term solution is Classic+. Like it or not, Blizzard-Activision plans long term. And TBC is a FIXED, 2 years, term. Blizzard doesn't say it, because of the backlash, but TBC was NEVER in the works for a re-release.
---
good for pvp pushback when u run oom too
---
Where is your proof?
---
Considering race changes weren't in vanilla, they probably won't be in classic, but no word, though.
---
Who said that?
---
You don't really just get 75 spell pen either. There's only 10 of it on the whole T2.5 set, and there's not that much of it elsewhere. I'm not sure you *can* get 75 in AQ40, and even if you could, there's no way you get to pick and choose amongst the spell pen items because mages and warlocks still want it.
---
&gt; you should be able to see incoming heals.
---
I'm somewhat sure I read this won't be possible since it uses the new API or something
---
You don't know that they would make the same mistakes again. Classic and BFA cater to two different audiences. They can make decisions in Classic that would absolutely abhor the BFA audience. This means they would probably have different design philosophies when creating any new content. Overwhelming optimism is stupid, but so is overwhelming pessimism. It is not out of the realms of possibility for the devs to rethink their strategies when it comes to classic.
---
I would personally rather see an attempt at new content than see them go through the motions of the original trilogy.
---
I've played vanilla and killed KT. I wanna play Bc. We've literally never seen a good BC third party server. The guys who petitioned to make classic happen have already seen everything and want tbc. As long as they keep the classic servers running what's the issue?
---
That's encouraging! I know they are using the old database data and art assets, plus historical accuracy seems to be important to the development team so I am hoping I will get to explore some of these places.
---
Where did OP say that they wanted PVE-PVP transfers? They just stated that that's the way it was in vanilla and asked if there was any word on character transfers in general.
---
And why are you assuming it won't bring in new players? Because it will, 100%, bring in new players...because it is a NEW GAME. Classic+ is a NEW GAME.
---
TBC is low investment, yes...but in 2 years IT IS OVER. And it won't bring new players. 
---
Classic+ is the only solution that, if done right, brings in new players...LONG TERM.
---
If they do it right or not, WE DO NOT KNOW.
---
But let's just be frank and assume that they want to do it right, shall we?
---
Could just be my bad memory, but seeing that I still have Dartol's rod in my inventory (haven't played in years, but you get my point), and I think I've completed every single quest in that chain...does it really disappear if you complete the chain? It's been way too long for me to remember, but it's definitely one of the coolest items for me personally
---
What consumables would a semi hardcore or middle of the pack guild expect?
---
I just want to say one thing, if TBC comes in a different server, that's fine for me. Call it freedom. 
---
* The player who wants to play classic, hey they have their servers just like that, classic
---
* The player who wants to play TBC, hey they their servers just like that, TBC
---
You might think, well if people get divided between servers, the pop of each server could fall. Not if layers get involved, or servers get merged.
---
Each one could simply play what they want, classic, TBC, WLK... BFA (hell no).
---
And all of this with "no effort". Creating new content is making a new game, and that's is a completily different point, even isf is called classic+
---
A **classic**, **TBC** server should be recreating an **already existing game** (well, past existing game), and that's it. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
But don't finish other players hopes, **the better solution is always freedom**.

June? You would be very slow if you weren’t at least pre-raid BiS geared by now
---
Where did i say OP said so? This post is obviously about transfering pve to pvp and on that topic i voiced my opinion.
---
Did timbermaw exalted on my hunter. Took bloody forever. At least 2 months, probably longer, with some heavy 3-4 hr grinds like you said. 
---
Sweet PvP trinket tho ❤️
---
So the only reason you were motived to improve your health is classic wow? And your family and job do not give you any motivation?
---
Boy, do I feel sorry for your wife and kids. A video game holds more worth for you than they do...
---
Druids should absolutely innervate themselves. It's their own cooldown. This goes for all kinds of druids.
---
If the healers are struggling to keep their own mana up [Priest with T2 3set, Paladins are mana efficient as hell, Shamans maybe.] then they need to play better and use more consumables.
---
Is Enchanting too much trouble for a noob?
---
New to the game and will be rolling Warlock with Tailoring. I heard Enchanting is natural pairing, but also that it can be tough to level.
---
Considering I won't be min/maxing, following guides, or generally aiming for high-tier play (but simply enjoying the game as I go), what use will enchanting be to me? Am I better off grabbing a gathering profession to make some extra gold?
---
Heroic Leap was Cataclysm and horribly bugged at first, Victory Rush was Wrath and it was the one you know; kill an enemy to be allowed to use it, then hit a target, deal damage and heal yourself.
---
I'd hardly call a temporary cooldown based pet "class homogenization", it was an addition to your toolkit. Once Wotlk rolled around and normalized buffs, removed WF totem and gave a big middle finger to shamans by doing so, that was when Class homogenization started.
---
And if we're being *really* pedantic, Blizz changed classes throughout vanilla's lifespan. They buffed certain classes, added spells etc. Shield Slam didn't exist at first and gave warriors a way to purge, is that class homogenization? Not really.
---
A+
---
Again why is this useful? Just for speed?
---
Summoning to sac is only useful if you have fel Dom for the cast time, at which point the mana is also reduced? 
---
Not trying to be difficult, just not sure if I’m missing something!
---
Are you thinking pve or pvp or both?
---
Why separate the two at all? Separation of PvP and PvE progression (resilience) is one of the things that made me dislike TBC. Don't get me wrong, I think overall TBC is fantastic, and it has some of the most fun PvE ever made. But with the separation of PvP/PvE the game starts feeling *less* for me. I liked that I could raid, then use this gear in PvP. Or that I could do PvP, and use that gear in PvE. Although in classic PvE gear definitely gets the upper hand in the later raids, compared to PvP gear. That said, getting rank 10 early will be very beneficial for certain/most classes/specs, for PvE progression.
---
&gt; about 5-8 shamans in any given raid
---
That's never been the case on any pserver I've played. I played alliance in retail vanilla so I don't know how things were then, but shamans haven't been so popular that raids just routinely bring 5-8 of them. The most shamans I've ever seen in one raid lineup was 6 and that was considered an extreme amount. Some hardcore guilds will do speedrun records with 8 shamans just to maximize DPS, but you shouldn't expect that many to be in "any given raid."
---
Female Cow for the name puns 😁
---
Considered rolling PvE for the first time but because I have never experienced it I decided to just go PvP. Classic is such a special game that I don't want to gamble. I am very carebear:ish when I play, I basically never attack anyone but I do enjoy the feeling of danger. Would be a weird experience running around with the other faction right beside me without being on my guard at all. Maybe I would enjoy it but maybe I wouldn't. Safest bet is to just go with what I know.
---
Elwynn Forest for sure. It's got beautiful scenery, a great soundtrack, cute quests with the Stonefields and Mclures, little dungeon crawls in the mines, Hogger, you can hang out in Goldshire, and Stormwind is right there.
---
The post is not about transferring PvE to PvP. Nowhere in the post did OP say anything like that. He was asking if there was word on character transfers.
---
Get consecration first in Holy and then put your talents in Protection. Consecration is awesome for dungeon tanking and for aoe grind later on. As for seals, it depends on the weapon, but generally you will play with Seal of Righteousness (best for tanking) because you will also put talents to it in Holy to reach Consecration.
---
Early on it doesnt matter much. For solo leveling just equip the best weapon you have, even a 2-Hand. Later on around 40 you will want to start aoe grind, with Shield spike, Blessing of Salvation, Consecration and you will generally use Seal of Wisdom for mana efficiency.
---
Your best gear is "Of the Eagle" even for tanking. Stength does not give you much benefit in tanking and you will need lot of mana either for heal or for tank. Consecration and holy shield are expensive abilities.
---

---
you wanan go up to 41 level like this. Then you can re-talent to get Holy SHield, and then go for consecration again.
---
Ok if you just want to be a smartass, sure i agree with you lol.
---
With each and every update OSRS gets closer and closer to RS3. There's even new controversy with the introduction of cosmetic micro transactions the devs are trying to implement rn. The entire concept behind 07scape was that the game was better before they added GE and GWD. The auction house ruined all trading and social interaction that happened ingame. Why spam in chat to find an item when I can click a button and buy it instantly without saying a word to anyone? Does this sound familiar? Because the GE is not very different from the LFG system in wow. GWD got added because players were bored but with them come godswords and powercreep. Pvp gets completely ruined when you have access to powerful weapons that can oneshot players. They've added new mini games that are more efficient than older leveling methods meaning there's no reason to ever go back and do things the old way. The game is basically completely different from the runescape I know and love and that's why I refuse to play it. I desperately don't want to watch the same thing happen to classic.
---
Nice try FBI
---
Battlegrounds killed world PvP.
---
After battlegrounds were introduced works PvP was just ganking.
---
far too long.  This is one of the vanilla wow features that really was a back breaker , together with high pvp ranks.  As a  serious-casual player I could do anything in the game, including raiding in the top guild  (NB top guilds were not as tryhard as today) , but  this I never could do.
---
Summoning stones were rarely anyway. It takes away the MMORPG character. You might also well just have a dungeon finder if you don't want to travel through the world.
---
Guild banks are great. The problem is again they take away the interaction, coordinate and trust a role play game brings. I would not like having guild banks especially not if you can access them from anywhere. Part of the game is to organize a guild.
---
Saying classic TBC leads to Classic BFA is not the same at all as saying guild banks lead to LFR.  Guild banks actually have nothing to do with LFR from a game design standpoint.  Unless you really dumb it down to "convenience always = good", which is only a rule if game designers want it to be a rule.
---
Personally, I think they should add guild banks to the game.  When you hear about the criticisms about modern WoW, guild banks IS NOT the thing people complain about.
---
The major point behind Classic TBC = Classic BFA is the fact that you are removing any possibility for deviation from the past.  The reason #nochanges was a think for Classic Vanilla was because everyone was afraid of the same thing: Blizzard would add LFR and flying mounts to Classic WoW.  Well apparently they're not doing that, which is good.  But to go directly to Classic TBC would be to say that you just want to repeat history.
---
Walking to the Zepplin would take like 5 mins.
---
Wele was a 3 min CD, it wasn't a conventional pet until like Cata (?). You might as well say engineering/trinket pets are class homogenization then. 
---
Class identity was still alive an well in BC, just look at how Rock/Paper/Scissors PvP still was for example.
---
Agree, rp-pvp servers are all historically dead. Blizz is launching minimal servers and may not wanna roll the dice on a slot
---
What is the best place to buy it, for an european?
---
Proof of what? You want a seperate poll of how many people in the first poll did it out of support? I'm basing it on people commenting in the threads that some are signing it because it's an important issue even if they wont be on rp-pvp themselves.
---
How am I being a smart ass? You're literally putting words into OP's mouth.
---
Never said it wouldn't bring in new players, but there is no way to know if it will reach the blizzard benchmarks needed for it to be a success.
---
They can do classic+ after TBC, there is nothing in TBC that can't be discontinued in a future expansion.
---
TBC will give blizzard more time to evaluate the success of classic, and give a clear indication of how many people would keep playing classic going forward.
---
Some people will say it's nostalgia, and maybe it is, but I also think that sometimes good things get made, and whether it's a work of art, a painting, a piece of music, a poem or even a game, it has a timeless quality.
---
The creators of wow used the tools they had at the time to maximum effect.  
---
Despite not having a bloom effect, fancy dynamic sun-shafts, high polygon counts or rag-doll physics etc, I think the game remains very stylish and pleasing to look at. Everything is vivid and smooth, the curvature of the terrain, the sparkle of a mineral, the icons, even the typography,
---
Deserts, lush rain-forests, swamps, snowy mountains, fields of giant plague-ridden mushrooms, it all transitions seamlessly around you, accompanied by the ambient soundscapes of harsh winds rushing over barren mountain tops or birds chirping in a forest.

Why "I" left  retail. **\~ also an old player** 
---
No hate here. I just got bored.
---
Enchanting can be a money sink while lvling probably not the best profession for a new player. You can buy the enchants you want from a enchanter. What i would recommend you do is get mining stock yourself up with enough mats to power lvl goblin engineering at 60.
---
Fantastic reply, thank you very much!!
---
I agree 100%
---
They tried to wall off Zul Gurrub , but you still could climb it and leave the instance that way, and get into all sorts of unfinished map pieces behind the curtains.
---
Like I said this is just my opinion and you can offer no reason that will change it. Just like I will not make counter arguments to your opinion. Nobody is wrong here, it's just a matter of preference. Enjoy classic my friend.
---
I don't think this is necessarily true.  They aren't wrong when they say there are people who enjoy all the changes that were made to the game.  You can see some of those people commenting here in this thread.
---
I think Blizzard is completely aware that the Classic philosophy was different that the philosophy they have now.  If they assigned a team to make a game for that type of audience, they could do it.  The question is whether or not they think Classic TBC would be better.  We should help them answer that question.
---
Thats minus 50 fucking dee kay pee !!!
---
You could do the middle thing, no leveling guide, but a class guide. So you're experiencing the content but specced and geared to not needlessly gimp yourself:)

A group of 3 players would have no problem killing mobs in westfall.

Am I missing the joke here? There’s only one possible item reward from that quest, the carrot.

What are the various way people run BRD and what all bosses are included in each run?
---
E.g. emperor runs, lava runs, etc.
---
Flasks, any consumes required for your buffing, enchants, oils/poisons if youre melee, world buffs
---
I keep getting such mixed info. :(
---
I really don't know much about gearing in classic or how long it takes, it's a bit concerning to be stuck with a class that takes forever to get any gear on as I am not sure how much I'll be playing.
---
Go Ret, plenty of time to do an ultra marathon while you're auto attacking
---
Male Nightelf because they have the most lore behind them.
---
I don't think it takes longer to gear a shaman, you just have a smaller selection of ideal items to choose from. The BiS items are no more rare than they are for any other class, and sometimes even easier to get because most of it is wanted only by shamans. But there often isn't a satisfying "second best in slot" alternative whereas classes like rogues and mages can just use a random tier piece or whatever.
---
I’m down for classic+ but I want to be able to play my main again. I was a troll mage in classic then re-rolled blood elf mage when TBC came out as they were my favourite part of Warcraft 3. 
---
I played belf mage all of TBC &gt; All of WOTLK &gt; Start of CATA &gt; Quit &gt; Came back and played all of Legion. I know we’re still in Vanilla territory but I want to be able to play my main once again in the future. Belves are a must for me once the Vanilla content cycle is over.
---
So close!
---
I think you are doing assumptions that are simply not true. Unknown in the better case.
---
* 40% the player base wants a so-called Classic+ expansions and refuse to play TBC, 40% wants TBC and refuse to play Wrath, and 20% want Wrath
---
*  we lose 40% of the players base
---
* If we can design these Classic+ expansions preserving the old school MMORPG game design philosophy, we will get a LONG TERM steady or even increasing revenue flow, for at least 10 years. 
---
* TBC and Wrath will have less players than Classic, and will last for 4 years only. 
---
* they will decide for a LONG TERM solution 
---
Resuming, you are talking about unknown % (player, player base etc.). 
---
You are assuming that people want to play wow for another 10 years
---
You are assiming than there si more ppeople interested in classic than in TBC, but if you see historical wow numbers, there were a lot more players in TBC and WTL.
---
You think Activision want long term games, and the fact is that all companies (and people) want short time revenues. All the game industry is moving in the opossite direction you are talking about.
---
Is your point, and is fine. I respect it. But be careful not mixing your own desires with other's desires, or even reality.
---
Cant we just have classic TBC as a separate so that it can coexist with classic? I think that's what the people asking for tbc servers want.
---
I understand what you are saying, and agree with a lot of it.
---
In fact I agree with almost every word of it... but I would be willing trade it all away for one thing.
---
I want that class changes.  
---
I'm sorry but class design was 10x better after 2.0 Prot pally, hunter, druid, priest, warrior all felt incredibly improved and I don't give two shits about the RPG aspects that say I should have an class that plays like ass.
---
No one was confused about "class identity" in TBC, and the slippery slope argument is bullshit. 
---
Because there weren't any overarching improvements to classes post TBC, there were CHANGES ad nauseam, and possible a few specs still needed minor adjustments which could be considered, but all the classes felt fun to play. I know because i played every class but mage in both Vanilla and TBC, and no one can reasonably argue that Mage wasn't disgustingly OP the whole time :P
---
Classic wow is awesome and I am going to play the hell out of it, but that's despite the way my favorite classes feel, not because of.  The depth of the world, the characters, zones and dungeons and the way they all weave together, The persistent world that rewards your investment in your character, professions, gear, even farming gold and consumables....
---
Every thing else I am ok with leaving, 
---
lvl 70?  toss it, 
---
flying and LFG?  trash bin, 
---
stat explosion?  summary execution for anyone who even hints at it. 
---
They can mine outlands zones and assets to build a more classic like experience in a new outlands.. that would be the height of perfection...
---
But if it's a choice of keeping vanilla class design or jumping ship for TBC I won't even look for a life jacket.
---
PvP. Because it's going to more populated. But mainly because my girlfriend is forcing me too.
---
I have fond memories of leveling with enchanting as I found it quite satisfying to improve all the pieces of gear I found. I never got to 60 with the character but had a lot of fun with it regardless.
---
It all depends on what you find enjoyable.
---
If you expect everyone to agree with our crackpot theories don't post them on the internet.

I have uBlock Origin and the site loads fine for me. Im not a big fan of autoplaying music on websites aswell but at least there is an pause button.

Jesus, everyone on this sub says they're a Naxx raider, and a r10 player. Maybe you were there and your guild broke apart. That sucks, but talk about not being able to see the forest for the trees. It did far more good than bad, and talking about your particular guild, or the few mega-guilds that broke apart is ignoring all the positives and really is revisionist history.

World of warcraft 2

Just go Netherwing? 1x and as close to the real thing you'll get from a private server.
---
That example is a pretty poor point of reference too. Leave out the ...’s, leave out the -‘s, just use a single period or comma. You can also use semicolons, but even most native English speakers don’t know when to use them.
---
I agree that class identity was still alive in BC.  I'm simply arguing that the door to losing identity was opened.  Wele was out of the question in Vanilla from a design philosophy perspective, but it wasn't out of the question in BC, albeit on a cooldown.
---
Perhaps my memory of TBC class abilities isn't as good as I thought it was.  I haven't played on any TBC private servers after all so I'm trying to remember from way back.
---
Damn, still not providing any points while just attacking and attempting to belittle someone. Life must have been rough for you. I am sorry.
---
Are you from Latin America? It seems Brazil ppl often use "..." to express some pauses.
---
Otherwise, good job on your achievements!
---
Dailies being a chore is the dumbest take I've ever heard. Ogrila dailies gave you 12g per quest and basically no reward until you got the mounts at exalted. Let's not pretend it was some mandatory thing you had to do to stay competative.
---
Advice wise I will say to take the classic experience for what it is. Leveling is slow extremely slow. Unless you’re intentionally going out of your way to level fast it’s going to be an entire process that you might not be used to if you didn’t play back then. 
---
Along the way experience the experience of leveling. Back in classic we didn’t roll a character and blitz to max level so we could gear as fast as we could for endgame unless we were making an alt. We leveled, we quested, ran dungeons, made friends, made connections, sat in a town and talked shit in general chat for 30 minutes. Log off and get back on the next day. See your friends progress and ask them if they wanna run shadowfang keep for that drop you’ve been wanting. We sat in stranglethorn vale trying to level while 3 horde camped us sometimes for an hour at a time. 
---
Leveling in those days was actually part of the game. And with those connections you made while leveling you “prepared for endgame” and leveraged your connections to find guilds to raid with. 
---
You got to know much of your server on a person level. I still to this day remember a lot of people and their stories. I’m actually hoping to reconnect with some of the people I played vanilla with since I still have their battlenet ID’s (we didn’t have those back then just a friends list) 
---
Ps: It’s kind of funny how things are considered the “golden days”. Back in wotlk and tbc, classic was considered the dark ages. Now after all that’s changed we wanna go back. It’s sort of an ironic and sweet end. It’s been a long time coming. I miss that old world.
---
I know guild banks have nothing to do with LFR. Guild banks are fantastic and avoid people account sharing just to make a toon for all the guild's resources which is silly. It was just bad design that they were not included from day one. I was just trying to state that some folks feel that if you make one change to classic you have to make all of the changes, which i disagree with.
---
I think you may be overlooking the deviation from the past. Now, if you like classic, you can stay there, hopefully you will not be forced to other expansions like in the days of old. That is why it bothers me about the "No to TBC" comments, if you like classic better you can play that. Like TBC more? Have at it. We all have opinions of when we enjoyed WoW the most, I am just saying that we all deserve a chance to play in the version of the game we like the most. Shit, I hated pandaland and its when I quit the game, but if some people would be happy running around there all day, who am I to say they are wrong?
---
Except you forge to mention people who have no intention of playing on an RP-PvP server also sign these. As per reddit comments stating this :)
---
Can you show a talent tree of this?
---
Are you older?
---
That is my single biggest gripe about recent MMOs.  The people in charge of designing them are so focused on the moment to moment engagement that there is always something ridiculous going on.  They often forget that in a social environment the people who will stick around want a more organic experience.
---
Nah. It ain't.
---
I guess you might order it Amazon.com
---
Yah... the majority of people here will be the minority of people in classic. Play whatever is fun for you.
---
Sure but in vanilla you get talent trees, which give a vanilla level 40 more specialization choices than a new max level on retail.
---
Generally retail is considered more of walled garden and vanilla a sandbox.
---
I’d personally love an add on where I could track my own achievements privately
---
Especially the part with relearning stuff is important for me. When I try bfa I have no damn clue where to get items because there are 2mio ways outside of raids and when something drops its the same item other people have but better or worse and I don‘t understand this system at all
---
Rogues, Priests, Paladins, Shamans, Druids, and Warriors.
---
If classic+ includes class and spec improvements at least as good as TBC's then I thing he community could rally behind Classic+,  but we already KNOW TBCs class designs are next level... Why gamble on the current devs out doing them?
---
There's also a looot a great content in TBC besides calss design,  but I would be happy to see it cannibalized and used as fodder for classic+   the only part that's not negotiable is the class/spec improvements.
---
Just starting searing gorge wont be long till i am in felwood.
---
Spec 1 is flat out bad. First you should be doing everything you can to kite melee. Two your missing out on the versatility the entire resto tree supplies you.
---
Tanaris, and it's hot here...
---
Does FAP share a cooldown with other pots and how long is it?
---
Thanks. I really needed that zero haha
---
34-I got into stv a little late
---
If I use swiftness potion with the running trinket and pop the engineers rocket boots does it all stack?
---
If you're gonna be reinstalling everything anyways why not do a little research and try some flavor of linux? From what I read wow runs pretty well on linux now.
---
At the beginning of Burning Crusade I joined a wonderful guild that treated me so well, but I never got over stressing myself out about raid performance. The fact that women were perceived as "bad" loomed over my head and I had a huge chip on my shoulder about proving that wrong. As the game changed I just felt like I couldn't keep up. I started playing less and less as I could cope with it less and less. Finally I realized I was just stressing myself out over a video game and it was doing nothing good for me. I still am in the same guild although only a few of the original people still play, and I buy every expansion and get to cap and thats about it. Now there's so much paranoia about every woman being an "egirl" and a "thot" that I don't think I could start playing with a bunch of strangers again.
---
You said flying killed world pvp. I said that was revisionist history because world pvp died in 1.10 when you queue up for cross realm bgs. The only wpvp that existed beyond that was ganking which still existed in TBC any way. That's also ignoring Isle of Quel'danas which was a hot bed for world PvP
---
You said 10/25 man killed guilds. I said that's revisionist history because despite maybe your guild breaking up, it saved far far far far more guilds.
---
Your other points are fine, even if they are subjective. Youre the one who brought up being r11 and raiding in naxx, which means nothing because you can''t prove it hear.
---
I mean, it sounds like you just ignored the points in my first response and wanted to get all butt hurt about feeling personally attacked.
---
Himself?

---
With ya bro as an old fart with a kid. I would add to the list that self-respecting npc’s should stop kissing our ass. I don’t play wow for affirmation, i play for escapism
---
In practice even most hardcore guilds aren't going to expect you to flask for everything. It's simply too expensive.
---
If you go back and watch first C'thun kills you'll see players starting the fight without a flask, but popping it during phase 2 when it looks like they have a shot of getting a kill.
---
55?
---
Just entered your twenties huh?
---
thats pretty nifty for rp thanks.
---
52. Which is why I am still looking. I am fairly sure that in 3 years I will find my way. :)
---
Around 46?
---
You could try keeping a wow diary. Write down some goals and mark them once completed. For example:
---
1. Reach level 10
---
2. Reach level 60
---
3. Create a character 
---
4. Create a female orc 
---
5. Give a free item 
---
6. Get seduced by a female orc
---
Sky is the limit!
---
Dinged 40 yet?
---
No worries! Personally, I am amazed at the mentality to approach the game casually while progressing and at the organization of your group as a whole to make it all work in a structured way. So take it as a form of positive feedback to see that there are other people in the same situation that would like to join the same boat. :)
---
Don't get eaten by a Devilsaur
---
If you really hate your healer friend, by all means, tank as Fury.
---
If you hate yourself and all your friends, and like wipes and repair costs...again, tank as Fury.
---
If you love your friends...be Prot.
---
I can tank dungeons 5-7 lvls above my level as Prot. As Fury, it is impossible to do it, no matter what people say. Or it is possible, if you have a lot of gold for repairs and consumables, and prefer wiping for 4 hours instead not wiping and finish in 1 hr.
---
As for lvl 60, tanking as Prot is a BREEZE. The group will LOVE you. 
---
And if anyone thinks that a Fury tank makes a run faster than a Prot...clearly they never tanked as BOTH in Vanilla.
---
I’ve got a great financial guy that I work with and I have a degree in finance myself.  I fully understand the theories involved in leveraging.  Appreciate your advice though!
---
*Hey fellow kids, wanna doxx yourself?*
---
Op got rekt
---
Thank you and enjoy classic as well :)
---
With 40 people per raid there's absolutely no way everyone gets along anyway.
---
The Asus you talked about looks to be more than fine.  I don't know if I would go any cheaper though.
---
Depending on what you choose to play and the attitude presented when you approach the said guild, if it were me making the choice, I'd consider turning you down as a group.
---
 Are you just applying as a group (using them as leverage to get in as well) or are you a "packaged deal" in the sense of "we all raid or we all leave"? If you do choose a "meme spec" what will be your attitude if you don't get into a raid?
---
The vibe I'm getting from the OPs post is "lolz 4 healers I can do what I want" which is detrimental to a guilds success and overall survival. I'm not saying this is who you are or what you're about but thats the vibe I'm getting from the post.
---
thats what i wanted to hear.
---
Yea that is true and I’ve thought about it but in all honesty I’d be too lazy to make it so I’m just hoping someone else comes up with a good list and makes an addon haha. Otherwise I’ll probably just keep a mental note to do as much as I can.
---
Closer to 40 than 50, but yes...
---
Why the fuck is resilience a bad thing? I'm for example interested only in PvP. But I HAVE to raid to get best gear. Why don't I get gear by you know...playing the part of the game IT'S MADE FOR?
---
Also I'd shrink the raids to 1tbh.
---
How do people even play this game with a controller?
---
I'd recommend this as well. Just level with the correct spec and get to know the class basics. Don't overwhelm yourself with information. Leveling guides ruin games for new players.
---
Undead mage here, should I do the starting zone + silvepine or starting + Xroads? 
---
Not sure if the second route would get me too inside the whole ratpack that will be leveling in xroads
---
Discord made websites obsolete. Now websites are just to show off; it can create some sort of prestige to your guild especially if you're jumping into other games in the future with the same people. Sometimes a website is a turn off for people especially if you make it mandatory for them to go there.
---
Discord is a must, discord is the way to go.
---
Youre an rp pvp player and you are being toxic to me for talking about how good rp-pvp is. what the hell is wrong with you man?
---
I'm assuming it has a GTX 1650 right? I'm in the US, and couldn't find that exact model here, but I did see it on a EU site.
---
Yo, no one's bullying you. They're giving you answers you don't like. There's a difference. Check yourself.
---
No shit it was removed my mods, tard
---
Well, why do you take every legitimate criticism of your interpretation of your numbers as a personal attack? Stop acting like a spoiled crybaby. Instead of playing the victim, address the valid criticism.
---
Your assumptions WILDLY skew your numbers in your favour. You're assuming that only 10% who want a RPPVP server are voting. You're assuming that the number is 23.000 people, not 2.3k. That's VERY bold.
---
You're also assuming that there are no sympathy votes.
---
Your are wrong. Vanilla just had very BAD class balance. TBC was as diverse as Vanilla but it fixed the AWFUL class balance of vanilla. There is no more to it than this.
---
It is worth mentioning that when you abandoned a quest on beta, you abandoned all the quest items aswell, might be the case for the rod of transformation
---
If all you do is wanna lose weight, just eat better.

Huh? You just map forward back and the two strafes to the analog. Its easy. But I am looking to avoid having to setup a giant joytokey profile like that.
---
Yep, that's the one.
---
OSRS is nothing like RS3, the time it takes to max skills is the first notable difference. The polling system has its flaws, but it is also pretty effective, judging by the fact the game has grown in popularity. In fact, because of this polling system, they were not able to implement cosmetic microtransactions.
---
The GE was one such thing that was polled. I think some of the reasons included the fact that scammers were incredibly prevalent beforehand. The LFG system in WoW is completely different. Dungeons have a social aspect to them that is completely robbed by LFG. In OSRS, most trades would not result in any friendship or camaraderie. 
---
GWD was polled as well, and is generally considered to be great PVE content. There are problems with PVP, however the devs have assured us that they are committed to improving it. The new mini games are polled with the knowledge of the expected exp rates. 
---
The idea of OSRS was not that the game was better before GE and GWD, it was to continue updating the game in the same spirit that it had originally been developed in before it fundamentally changed. EoC was the death of the game, but the removal of the wilderness was the first step towards it. Not everything before 2007 was perfect, and not everything after was bad.
---
Legitimate criticisms dont start with calling people disingenuous. I have nothing more to say to you otherwise you might start caps locking again to highlight how important you feel your words are.
---
Anyone know what they're doing with quests whose rewards were changed to a different item at some point in vanilla? For instance, the Darkreaver Menace quest originally gave you [this](https://itemization.info/item/18807) but the reward was later changed to [this](https://itemization.info/item/20134). Which one will be in Classic?
---
yes, the asus is good for wow!
---
Arena was the death of wow pvp.
---
All items will have the values they had in 1.12.
---
And Arena killed serious BGs. Personally i prefer BGs over the others.
---
Agree. OP and others are people who don't understand how cause and effect.  
---
I will say flying shouldn't have ever been a thing. (Every x-pack they remove it and then add it again via some skill or something, its dumb.)
---
But other than this your spot on Vanilla wow wasn't a great game, it was an easy mmo for new player to level in and do basic stuff with a large name. Its a really good MMORPG. But compared to others and TBC and Wrath is not better (Even in wrath the raid splitting and watering down of classes may have been too far. the Nerf to leveling difficulty is a massive issue in wrath. But as a end game mmorpg its really good.)
---
TBC is arguably the best of wow, most guild always had a raid or 3 to look forward to after clearing their current one. You could play more than ~7 specs without being a semi gimp.  Leveling still took effort but the flow was better.
---
I mean 3 people had to go to the stone... its not like it was lfd.
---
Not to mention that seal, judgment, seal is most of your mana
---
Everyone cleaned dungeons and Molten Core. New generation of player is too good !
---
pass
---
You complain about raiding and say you'd shrink raiding.
---
Do people not remember how bad resilence was in TBC? It wasn't until later x-packs that they actually fixed it. DoTs were so overpowered then. You can provide a new tier of pvp gear without adding resilience while still making raid gear viable for pvp.
---
Enjoy your time leveling. Going at a more slow pace means you actually experience the full game including doing dungeons and cool quest chains at appropriate level; and as a plus, you'll stay well geared for your level, which really helps for when you actually do want to push for that next level!
---
Bum-rushing to 60 is for us people who have played this game for forever and want to be one of those geared 60s jumping around on epic mounts in Ironforge asap!
---
Legplates of blazing light
---
Aren’t bears also big hair gay men?
---
TBC best xpac, period.
---
[This](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgstxMuZx) is by all means the perfect spec for both PvE and PvP though.
---
If you want something more damaging instead of a group PvP support spec, I'd recommend [SM/Ruin warlock](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbkAZZgx0tM0z) or hunter (probably either something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cbZiVohthtI0izoh) or [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#ce0M0xxZiVohtht), depends on your gear).
---
Lol, imagine getting worked up over observations from a beta stress test....Undead go to the Barrens after Tirisfal, no one is hauling their level one ass to the valley of trials, there's no point.
---
By that logic Classic Vanilla leads to Classic TBC thus you should never have Classic Vanilla. 
---
See how that logic works against what you want when universally applied?
---
Or in this case losz
---
Yup! I and a friend used to make similar jokes if we got a piece of software working for the first time.
---
"Works on my machine! Ship it!"
---
What are pvp servers like?
---
I like the idea that other players my same level can always attack me and vise versa, but a level 60 going around repeatedly killing us at 20 will get old really fast.
---
A lot of people here think that it's only worth playing a race/class combo if it's the absolute min/max of that combo. There are also tons of guides online ranking which race is best for each class, which will definitely influence people. Obviously in the end it should be "what you think looks good in end game armor" and "have fun" and class/race fantasy. However, with the guides and such, the reasons for not playing nelf are:  
---
As priest, there are "better" choices for the racial priest spells. Dodge, and a channelled low damage ability just aren't great. Dwarf fear ward is considered one of the best spells in the game.  
---
Nelf warrior has potential for being decent at tanking due to the dodge talent, but the other racials (especially dwarf and human) are better for pvp, and for pve dps.  
---
Nelf hunter is potentially the best for their base starting agility. Again, however, outshined by dwarf racials.  
---
Nelf is the only race that can play druid. So, starting zone will be loads of druids and a sprinkling of the others.
---
Thought you only needed like revered for the enchant recipes?
---
hmm, i remember seeing it here (and it had a lot of reply), so shouldn't be hard to find it.
---
Some key tag the guy who was making all those badass emblem collages
---
The off hand from the lvl 50 mage quest is biz until AV iirc
---
Nothing you can do about it if they don’t care about their rank and therefore dishonorable kills
---
&gt;Of course it will. If Blizz does classic TBC then the fanbase will want every expansion remade and the community will be splintered.
---
By the same logic Classic Vanilla leads to Classic TBC ... etc. Thus you should never have Classic Vanilla. 
---
If your  argument is but we can stop it has Classic Vanilla, then the argument we can stop it at [insert your xpack] is equally valid.
---
Pick one. Or be illogical.
---
Says a person who could hack it in TBC.
---
A cousin brought me to WoW on pservers (Tbc).
---
Later i tried other expansions, including vanilla. I liked it (Even if i only reached lvl 60 and didn't raided). 
---
Some months ago I bought retail and played BFA --&gt; realized it was extremely bad, and the event bg in Hillsbrad made me want go back to vanilla.
---
There is irony in that the hardcore guilds going into all raids with full buffs and consumables have far more leeway with what classes they take.
---
While those situations can be great, often it's actually detrimental as they are just taking so much unnecessary damage that it can cause you to run out of mana just from trying to keep them alive and it will hurt the rest of the party and potentially cause a wipe just because you were trying to keep that one guy alive who refuses to just not take unnecessary damage.
---
And while this isn't always the case, the people who stand it fire and don't pay attention are often the same people who don't interrupt or stun enemy spellcasts, so simply by having them there, the enemies will often be getting off more spells and putting out even more damage to the rest of your group, so that mana will be even more needed.
---
But I get what you're saying, those moments where you can say "Don't worry about standing in the fire, just dps hard and I'll heal through it" can feel very rewarding and make you feel like a boss, but that's usually done with people you communicate it with and know what they're doing. But these randoms who just refuse to learn and don't know better probably aren't the ones doing big dps to begin with, and by enabling them like this prevents them from learning and means more people will just have to deal with this behaviour of theirs in the future. Plus it puts it into their head that "This healer must be bad since that one time a different healer healed me through the fire. This wipe is all the healer's fault."
---
DP is a benefint no?
---
Gnome warrior is arguably the best pvp choice on alliance due to escape artist being like a second trinket on a low cd. Some of the most hardcore private server players went gnome to maximize their pvp potential.
---
I quit well before cata but I watched my irl friends go through it and the zone changes reminded me of when parents toss out your old toys: sure, you don't play with those toys anymore, but maybe someday you would like to see them again, and although you've been off doing other things for some time now, it hurts inside to lose that piece of the past.
---
Is there anything like this for iOS?
---
&gt; The only way Classic+ can happen is if Classic brings in a lot of new players
---
Even then, Blizz is going to try to move those players over to retail.
---
Racials are negligable for pve except fear ward. Yes you can raid as a gnome prot warrior.
---
Will battlegrounds have the "preparation" buff making spells cost no mana?
---
Cant we Just make classic a succes and stop there? I dont want the same company that ruined Warcraft to ruin it again.
---
Just let me enjoy classic for two years. If it bleeds out we had a good run and something we could enjoy together. If it doesnt bleed out we have the classic we wanted.
---
No it wouldn't
---
If TBC releases and they copy your character and keep the classic up and later release C+ itr wouldn't stop this at all.
---
The issue here is split development and or player base... Dude after naxx classic is going to die. Logging in just for raids is WORSE in vanilla than TBC or Wrath.  As once you got your professions and say BWL done... made some money, there isn't anything to do to accomplish more. 
---
If classic + takes them 3-4 years they could even re-release classic and it wouldn't be the end of much. (i don't like this idea, but i am just saying people would still make new characters to play it.)
---
I like it
---
Unless you are aiming to join some extreme min/max guild that actively hunts world firsts or server firsts it really won't matter. Choose the race that you want to play the most. Remember, you're gonna stare at the mofo for hundreds of hours.
---
It does, which would probably be nice for tanking.
---
I imagine a ret paladin would rather use a two handed weapon though.
---
Great
---
I'd say only loatheb (for DPS), thaddius, gothik, patchwerk, gluth if you don't kill before decimate, 4 horsemen, sapphiron and Kel thuzad are really hard on your mana. Noth if your raid isn't good and you go to 2nd add phase.
---
Gnome is the master race. Pick it just for the voice emotes (male gnome)
---
Doing the same over again and expecting different results is whats gonna happen here. Let it stop at Classic and possibly expand from that. Do it another way.
---
If things go out of hand warlocks are better.
---
Our first 4 horsemen kill was an 18 minute mess and I struggled, playing a mage. Ended up wanding a few times.
---
I just find it kinda cool that people can still get into it. Prooves that there is more to it than just nostalgia.
---
Whoops, my bad I'll edit it to say "balance druids shouldn't innervate themselves".
---
Trolls are the best with their orbs but undeads fit the lore so perfectly
---
Dwarf rogue
---
/u/HerpDerp_5150 please add the Shaman one especially!
---
You're right, it helps but it's really not enough. You can't cast warstomp in bear form, and it has a cast time. So you'll need to shift out of bear, try to get the cast off while getting hurt in caster form, and then try to get off heals in the time the stun lasts. And you probably won't get off much healing done to offset the damage you took in caster form.
---
There are of course times when you can manage this well, such as getting some distance before starting your warstomp cast and getting it off as they get into range, and then kiting a bit while you apply hots, but none of it is reliable. Especially if there are multiple mobs in the pull, and even more so if they have ranged or casters in the pull.
---
So you can do it, but it's just not reliable.
---
The only reliable healing you can really do is between pulls to top yourself off and pre-hotting for extra healing and aggro during the start of the next pull and to let the healer drink sooner and longer.
---
As a Tauren Feral Druid back in the early days of WoW, I go so little use out of warstomp that I almost never used it. Tauren being the only horde race that could be druids, having a racial that can't even be used while in shapeshift form always felt so incredibly awkward and counter intuitive to me. And honestly, in any situation I wanted to use warstomp, entangling roots worked out better. It doesn't DR with your bash, maim, or pounce, it lasts longer allowing you to get off more heals, and has better range so you can get some distance before casting it and don't have to time them getting into range at just the right moment, giving you more time and freedom to heal more.
---
... ... ... ...
---
This is a great meme, I love it.
---
Shamans and Paladins
---
what i want is a cycle of thing where classic resets once every two years i want the same for TBC and i want a modified WotLK (simply put the secound half of WotLK is just kills the community aspect).
---
and then we have a classic+ which will start with MC reblanace. races will be rebalanced a bit (i am thinking for melee all of the weapon spec bonus) aswell as certain classes being redone. (retri paladins being a mix of tbc and wotlk, prot paladins being the clear aoe tanks etc.) and then just work on a reimagined WoW.
---
I recommend Zygor @ zygorguides.com
---
Very good quality addon and guides. Pricey, but good investment.
---
You can clear the game as a gnome warrior. I promise you.
---
Needs more AV flowers for optimal flamboyant masculinity.
---
I'm sorry to say this but if you can't prioritise your kid ahead of classic wow you should not under any circumstances play it.
---
I loved to spend 12+ hours in front of the computer when I was a kid. Now I'm 30, with two kids and I expect an average of 1-4 hours a week. 
---
But if you want to play a bit more make 22-00 your gaming time. But the kid to sleep, spend a few hours with the wife and then play 2 hours. But that's dependent on the the fact that you keep it like the rules, which you admitted to having a hard time with
---
Yeah (you are correct jeremiah), Vanilla wow grew well but TBC carried the same growth rate as 1/2 of vanillas time. That is a super impressive feat. Wrath was flat but retained its population.
---
By all accounts people wanted TBC as much as, or more than, they wanted Classic. Past tense.
---
But you have the Changes when we want them crew coming in and laying down some high level of bull to twist reality into their preferred state.
---
the truth is TBC is as or more popular as Vanilla was. And if you want to assume anything assume using this fact that we do know.
---
According to Wowpedia:
---
&gt;The subject of this article or section did not make it out of the beta stages of World of Warcraft or its expansions.
---
I dont know that process is what im trying to avoid asking this question. For retail wow there are full controller suppprt mods that display buttons and all that shit
---
Didn't have enchanting in vanilla so definitly take in account all these comments.
---
There are also more enchanting options. I pointed this one out because as a healer (or a tank) there is the option to reserve righteous orbs. I don't see that happening much as a dps (or finding groups quickly enough so that it's viable)
---
I cant imagine playing the game without pvp, it brings so much of that childhood excitement back into the world
---
Undead are the most rolled race. Usually Tirisfal is the most insane zone on a server start. At the same time, then everybody goes to Barrens for the chat, RFC and WC. So I'd suggest the first route, but maybe skipping quests in Tirisfal and just grind mobs.
---
I play on a laptop with a i5 7300hq and gtx 1050. Works fine.
---
It's a beta item that doesn't exist in the actual game.
---
Dwarf then NE. NE's Shadowmeld is much better than most people think for any form of PvP (or areas with pvp).
---
Hardcore guilds that want to establish PvP dominance, such as Apes, will prioritize Gnomes over Human.  
---
The best of the best care about more than just raiding.
---
Thanks mate I'll check this out. The li k there about the shadow focus hit % is really interesting.
---
That's a silly fantasy.
---
The Growth of wow peaked in TBC.  it kept growing a little buit in to Wrath just from inertia and hype. 
---
But trying to pretend blizzard would make a business decision as stupid as *intentionally* tanking their subscriber numbers makes me think you are just trolling here.
---
Imagine calling someone bad because they don't eat, sleep, and breathe WoW. You can always spot the #1.
---
It allows you to frontload the mp5 gain though. Imagine using it 30 seconds in, and then again 3.5 minutes in during a 4 minute fight. That's 6 minutes worth of Mindtap Talisman in a 4 minute fight.
---
That's right, a lone warrior is laughable, but couple him with paladin, it suddenly becomes a problem.
---
Human is the worst Priest race in the game.
---
Think it’s an area thing, sorry
---
What primary professions give the most utility. Are craftable armour and weapons any better from quest drops?
---
Spec 2 no doubt.
---
Tauren have a very tranquill starting zone, most people like it very much. A huge plus is the fact that most people roll undead or orcs, so their zones are overcrowded (unlike this one).
---
The only downside is that it's pretty huge, so there might be a little more running involved, but not horribly much when you don't have ADHD. One more plus is that you will catch the flypoint Camp Taurajo in southern Barrens, while you run to Crossroads anyway.
---
I like the zone.
---
I mean I guess it's down to prefance, I like UD/orc but everyone is different
---
Is there a continent wide channel for asking for backup when there is a very high level enemy in your zone?
---
Tauren male!
---
Why even say anything?
---
&gt;For 2 years only. THAT IS IT.
---
People have been playing on vanilla private servers for way more than 2 years. There's nothing stopping Blizzard from making fresh servers.
---
With both walljumping and wallrunning in the game it was definitely a challenge to chain players.
---
I honestly hate seeing a warrior and a paladin roaming the world. 
---
I like world PvP and I like big numbers, I can not lie. However you decide to hit the warrior? 45% phyiscal damage mitigation, immediately healed by flash of light. You hit the paladin in full plate gear *plus* a 3000armor shield bringing his mitigation up to 60-65%? You might as well equip Cookie's Tenderizer, this is how it feels like dealing damage to a PvP healing paladin. &gt;:(
---
Exactly this
---
For some reason classic wowhead isn’t even close to functioning properly. They claimed it was a copy of their data from the classic era but it has at least Cata data absolutely all over it.
---
I’d imagine it will get better when the game goes live but right now classic wowhead is misleading in a lot of ways. Kinda surprised that it didn’t improve much if at all with the beta as well.
---
Are you interested in pve only or pvp only?
---
Oh k
---
Oh, yes you are right - then likely the 1.4 version, they change loot tables (and logically rewards, too) later. It's definitely a more edge case where it's hard to be certain though.
---
&gt; The problem was they didn’t know how to prevent players from jumping into the ocean / trying to leave the instance.
---
...invisible walls? That's how they did it in SFK.
---
And you can just jump off from the Hellfire Ramparts in BC, so that didn't seem to be a concern for them later on.
---
if pve check out https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1668
---
Didn’t Gabe dress as a female night elf Druid for Halloween or something?
---
All this is great except Holy Shock isn't needed at all and that point can be spent elsewhere.
---
Why be a bear when you could be a NINJA.
---
There is no balance when you have kid's. They come first. As they get older, it pays off for both you and them.
---
That being said, you'll have time to play. It'll just be inconsistent.

---
No one should have to suffer as a holy weaving priest... All that matters is shadow weaving, the rest of the spec is irrelevant. As long as the weaving is up the priest is an asset.
---
It would be perfectly possible to make all the specs usable and viable for pve and pvp without homogenizing everything.
---
I suspect the real reason for why all classes started to creep towards sameness was the need for balance in Arena.
---
Did you play primarily pve or PvP?
---
you will never hit max level. so forget about raiding.
---
I plan on playing a hunter in classic. I'm only going to play casually so probably no raiding (maybe pugs).
---
im kinda stuck on professions, i planned on going skinning&amp;leatherworking but i'm not sure how good the gear will be at 60. Will the gear be worth it if i won't get gear from raiding? Or is it not worth it? because im also thinking about mining&amp;engi for the fun gadgets
---
Your options are:
---
/join world
---
/g 
---
/1
---
....and introduced other huge errors like their entire strategy of how expansions are handled and served with massive power creep and obsoleting all non-expansion content.
---
Just get 2 common daggers and you should be cool
---
True, but since you have 3 gy's its also quite easy to deathwarp up to each spirit healer and res cutting the distance down to like nothing.
---
You can always just run around naked and kill people with a level 1 weapon.
---
Ranks come in p2, bgs in p3. I wouldn't recommend doing too much wpvp in p2 in 60% mount though.
---
&gt;Classic WoW, if you wanted to raid actively, was basically a second full time job with quite strict rules, if you wanted to see everything and the devs eventually saw this and made changes.
---
It's this idea that everyone have a \*right\* to see the content if they cannot put in the work that really killed wow for me. There's literally thousands of games where you can jump in and do all the content. An MMO **should** be a living breathing world where you as a player decide exactly how far you want to go.
---
The mechanics were easy compared to today, but the bosses could deal and take a lot more damage compared to average raider. You can add, that the average player had far less knowledge about good item builds and were to get them - everyone wanted the T0-set, despite the fact that there were much better non-set items to gather. The original Crimson Felt Hat for instance had +30 spell damage and was one of the best caster hads before the raids. That's why then it took much longer to clear the raids then on every private server since.
---
Yes, playing Classic WoW as an active raider was basically a full time job. The raids themselves, but also the farming in the gold for the rapair bills (particularly if you wore mail or plate), either farming gold or the materials for buffs, running special events like the tribute runs in Dire Maul to farm gear outside of raids. This was extremely time consuming and only a fraction of the player base could do it properly. This is no different today.
---
Arg! and on top of it all classic warriors have threat generating issues. Everything forces you to go human but my heart screams for a gnome!
---
LW is only really worth it if you are a guild leatherworker. I would reccomend min/eng since it sounds like you want to have fun, and eng is a ton of fun.
---
It's enought, if Blizzard didn't made bullshit and gave BFA's optimization on Classic. It would be able to run fastly on every PC, since it's a 2004 game.
---
I think you need to recognise that you won’t be able to put in more than 2 hours a day maximum and if you think you’ll be tempted to push that (or a similar limit) then to try and not play.
---
Just put some rules on it, maybe even with your SO so that youre both on the same page. Then you also have someone to hold you to account.
---
Also stay away from hardcore raiding and pvp, when you have other people demanding your time, you will have to make decisions that you shouldn’t.
---
But then how would you get to max level?
---
It fucking better be.
---
Yeah thing about pvp in BGs is the people there are kind of ok with getting killed, I enjoy the hunt.
---
5 mans in vanillia are super easy my guy.     If anything it’s retail that has challenging dungeon content
---
Shadow weave can help you while leveling, but only if you get it early. But you won't miss anything, if you just skip it, because you are not that gear dependend.

Respect goes both ways. She should respect him and let him play his game or any other activity he may want to partake in regardless of time. Set up some boundaries and respect each others with compromise of course.
---
She needs to sleep? Ok fine.
---
She can sleep all she wants, how does that effect him?
---
She wants to cuddle with him? Ok thats fine, get a memory foam mattress, watch the tv till she passes out then get up and go do whatever.
---
She a super light sleeper? Earplugs, dont do activities in the same room, use headphones, etc etc
---
Plenty of ways to work around it. Saying there is none is telling me the wife is a straight bitch who doesnt respect you and only wants her way.
---
You are taking this too seriously. I will not be a meme spec, but I will want to be at the top of the DPS meter.
---
No its becuase you think shamans are a good healer to dps.
---
One you still have this shaman healer. So they provide the buffs if they are healing or dpsing. So that entire dps increase argument is gone.
---
Two, NATURE resists. Quite a few mobs in MC, BWL, and AQ 40 have Nature and Fire resists/immunity. What type of damage do shamans mainly do? Nature then Fire. 
---
See your feelings are blinding you from the truth. You are projecting and have no clue what you are talking about.
---
Three, No shaman pve raiding spec has ele talents. Its deep ele with 5 or 12 enh. Even with say 21 in ele you don't get faster lightning bolt casts so you will NEVER keep up with other casting healer's dps. 
---
In short you have no clue what you are talking about and just want to raid probably some awful 30/21 spec no one wants (i would take an enh shaman willing to twist over that anyday).
---
Barrens rules. Lok Tar Ogar.
---
I pray everyday for RP-PvP. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
---
🙌🙌🙌
---
Buy a boost, obviously. Or remove leveling but Blizzard would never do that because token sales are too lucrative.
---
You just down rank... you aren't trying to win the dps just add as much as possible.
---
As an offtank? Sure. As the MT? It's a hard sell.
---
Warlocks can at least tap when they have to move, mages don't have the same luxury.
---
End game will all be about pots (Alchemy) or enchants. If you PVP, then Engineering also. Crafting gear or weapons can be done by guild mates, for example.
---
I agree with all of these things 👌👌
---
Iirc you could get an epic drop anywhere in the world.
---
Like, I was slaying some creatures in a beach somewhere, and this BOE epic would drop. It was an amazing feeling, cause epics were so rare back then, for the majority of players.
---
&gt;Primarily PVE
---
Ah yes. And I've already mentioned that for pve players, TBC was a excellent expansion. You got all class updates to make nearly all specs viable and the quantity of new dungeons for you play was good.
---
However, the fact that resilience became neceesary, arenas being the only good PvP option, and essentially removal if world PvP through flight and total buetral city imo made the game laughably dull for PvP players, especially those who sought world PvP.
---
The information I've read says that you want 310+ weapon skill to eliminate glancing blows. Which is why humans are so OP for PvE Warrior and Rogue.
---
&gt; ideally you probably want people to play both retail and classic
---
No. This is not feasible without radically changing how both of these games function. Retail is like a part time job. Classic is like a full time job. I'm sorry, but you're not going to get people to play both.
---
&gt; you need players from retail to join classic to make it a success.
---
Classic is bringing back MANY old players like me who haven't played for years. You don't need to leach retail players to make this a success.
---
This is rather accurate.
---
What? Gnomes is the masterpiece race, imagine this koochi looking hamster coming out of nowhere only to mortal strike you into oblivion with his tiny hands and then /dance on your confused corpse, sure you are probably top tier gank material for those pesky undead rogues but you are probably the definition of a wrecking ball and any horde that tastes your fury will not only lose his life but also his honor and will probably be shamed to death.

I'll happily sign it and have no intention of playing on one. I'm willing to bet I'm not unique.
---
This is very good and reasonable advice, thank you for the reply. I'm just worried that I lack the self control to police myself, and my relationship with my SO is sketchy at best. In all honesty I may just be searching for an easy alternative to good old fashioned self-discipline.
---
The biggest vanilla private server right now has normalized drop rates.
---
If a boss drops 2 items, both will have 50% chance. (Example: vishas in SM GY, the blue dagger is supposed to be a very rare drop).
---
Raid bosses work a bit differently but there's still some standarization.
---
It is different in the beta. It will be different in classic.
---
Another dad here. With a three year old and a two month old! We just have to play less. Something I've made great use of in other areas is alarms on my phone. Alarms for when to wake up, when to feed the kid, when she needs to go potty if she hasn't yet, when to spend time with wife, when to do chores, etc. Basically I've got dozens of alarms throughout the day because I'm a scatterbrained procrastinator and I'm so lazy I need to be kicked in the stomach to get started breathing in the morning. I'll just add another alarm for a couple days a week after the 3 year old is supposed to be in bed labeled "WoW Time"
---
This excites me so damn much. I have nervousness about playing classic because I know so little about the game... but from pserver play, I know I love gaining proficiency and knowledge to play the game better.... so excited for actually biting down on studying the mechanics and nuances  of how to pvp and pve.
---
Plus lore.... so much of my nostalgia in classic is going to be ironically placed in my mind. I played hearthstone, so bloodmage thalnos voice thing is nostalgic to the card game, which references the real game. Truly full circle.
---
&gt; All players have to do to beat classic dungeons is essentially control themselves.
---
Yes. But you can see how this would be a problem for retail players, right?
---
This spec actually does less dps than the PI or Higher Holy priest specs.  You would more than likely keep this person healing and keeping SW up.
---
False, and you are entitled to your opinion.
---
Escape artist has 60 second cooldown and nova 21 seconds.
---
At worst it would be up against every 3rd nova. If you kill the mage you will most likely have Escape artist up by the time the mages has ressed/buffed and such.
---
If you die than Escape artist will also be up by the time your ready.
---
For you to get novad 20 times, that would mean you are fighting close to 7 mages at onces, you probably would be close to dying just from nova damage at that point if all they cast is frostnova.
---
I was planning on being a healer anyways, but I hear retribution is quite bad later. I will be a dwarf female holy paladin with spinning braids I'm quite sure :)
---
Just by doing the eye test, I didn't notice any difference between 8 and 18GB ram. If you don't have an SSD with enough space for the wow installation I would upgrade the disk before considering buying more ram.
---
There are going to be so many retail people getting their asses handed to them in dungeons.
---
Agree, player base has gone to shit. 15% got M Xavius. The only low ones were mid tier expansions. Thanks for proving a point
---
That's because after some time you tend to forget the annoying and ugly parts of said golden days. That's what always happens as time goes by. I recommend this sub: r/lewronggeneration. There you can find examples from everywhere and anytime.
---
That's a good thing. There needs to be content to work towards in an MMO. The only way an MMO works is if lots of people are online, and that requires content to play/work towards. If there isn't content on the horizon, the devs will have to pump out tons of content constantly to keep up with demand. 
---
That's a major problem with retail. All new content is beaten in a month weeks at most by just about everyone, so people get bored and start demanding more stuff to do. Unfair for devs to have work months/years on content for it to be beaten in a weekend.
---
My immersion isn't all there if the horde can't try to kill me. That's worth the hours of wasted time alone, and the added intensity of raiding in a pvp server is icing on the cake as far as I'm concerned!
---
I doubt retail will die. And i doubt vanilla will have a long life. People will get through content fast and go back to world of chorecraft on retail. Who knows whats next? Tbc? Patch 1.14? Chances are slim they going to make alot of new content for it. I am looking forward for classic for a very long time. Resubbed hoping to get beta. Bought bfa to try it out played it for 3 weeks and quit. But its not going to die anytime soon. Im sure of that!
---
False would mean i am not entitled to this opinion but am incorrect.
---
Sounds reasonable, and I agree with you that different systems suit different guilds. Even the best system in the world won't be good if you aren't comfortable using it and deploying it properly.
---
If you're on the fence... What downsides do you foresee? How much you mitigate that?
---
What would be the next best alternative for you?
---
A capitalist economy is the only economy we have ever had in this country, what other system could have it had it's "best years" in? There is nothing else to compare it too. Have you ever asked yourself why Blizzard would even merge with Activision to begin with? It's because the owners of the company want more money. Fuck everyone else, including the people that actually made the game. Blizzard could have just coasted off of the money they initially made but they just choose not too because this braindead system encourages making more money constantly no matter what. It never fucking ends.
---
No one was farming RFC for raiding gear my man.
---
Adding a Crusader Strike on 6 sec cooldown would save ret
---
It was nowhere as bad as you make it out to be either...
---
Class Design isn't technically a part of TBC expansion. It just happened to exist DURING TBC expansion. 
---
If one looked at patch notes from vanilla, massive class balance changes were happening all the time. Not only numerical, as there were entire talent tree revamps, abilities given and removed, entire mechanics changed. For Classic we are getting the state of classes from 1.12, which is technically a completely arbitrary moment, no better or worse than 1.8 or 2.2. Especially that Blizzard admitted changes for several classes were delayed until TBC to make it a selling point. 
---
Nobody argues that its fun playing unviable/broken spec. Some people of course still play them... but only because they value the feeling of being unique over real power and usefullness of their character.
---
&gt; The biggest push for people wanting TBC is simply because those people started in TBC or finally hit end game there, and that's just their version of vanilla to us who only played vanilla.
---
This is what I was countering.
---
I never proposed, nor do I support a full on TBC classic...  I am expressing as clearly and as often as possible that TBC's class overhaul mandatory moving forward, to the point where if the classic+ Crowd tries to leave it out, than myself, and many others will opt to only then lobby for TBC classic.
---
I prefer classic+ with the class overhaul, and mining the expansions for fun bits.  but if I am forced to choose one or the other.
---
Class play-ability trumps the rest.
---
&gt; I'm so tired of snowflake casuals complaining and dumbing down the game expansion after expansion because they can only play 30 minutes every month and still feel the game owe them the same experience as hardcore raiders.
---
I don't really want exactly that, but tbh, i put in my time 15 years ago. I don't have as much time as i used to, but I'd love to kill twin emps sometime without spending 2 hours fighting trash.
---
If you are 60 you can always find a spot in a MC or dungeon run (strat,school, later DM)..you just have to ask
---
Well, he *was* a carpenter.
---
No it won't all stack
---
See, I do not consider "putting in hours" to be something that should be rewarded. Skill should be rewarded, as it is in arenas.

How important is fire resistance for each class/role in MC and Ony before everyone is geared?

I'm looking forward to the midnight release. When the sun rises I will be on the boat to auberdine

Vanilla Classic

TBC Classic

WOTLK Classic

Restart every 7 years until I Die.

Nice setup! A little cable management underneath will really set it off tho :)

To be fair, classic is not as perfect as this sub makes it out to be. I will most definitely play classic and enjoy it, but patiently waiting for my personally favourite period: TBC.

Why does everything have to be so serious? If this comment is to triggering for you, you must be pretty sad.

So by end game are you going to be using Mortal Kombat combo chains for spells?
---
I plan on spending the first few days just cooking/fishing and gathering herbs. When would be the best time to sell them?  I figure if I put it up right away, rather than wait 3-4 weeks I would lose out on possible gold.
---
Of topic but..
---
How do you show faction and class next to your name? :)
---
I don't believe there is, actually. 
---
But that's not much an issue because you can always teleport to moonglade and thrnnhearth stone back making your class skill updates the fastest aside mages at high levels with portals.
---
Yes, as I will try an RP server this time.
---
Much has already been said, but I haven’t noticed anyone mention “feedback”, that’s a pretty decent ability for a human s.priest. Pop that vs a caster add mana burn and they are oom pretty quick.
---
The worst feeling is knowing that only someone else who regularly plays healer will recognize what you did
---
In tbc you couldn't access guild banks from everywhere.

Guild perks came later.

was trying to spend as little as possible.

Tell your kid about the awesome mining game that daddy is going to be playing, and that when you're at work you will even let them play it too!

Wetlands run race could be fun to do with friends. You can actually do a lot of these in higher level zones than you. Just a race from A to B, using boats, dying, swimming, etc.
---
Class/race team battles in the Gurubashi Arena. 
---
First one to kill 1 of each mob in a zone.
---
First one to get a level 1 of the opposing faction to dance with them.
---
Killing all NPCs in an enemy city.
---
Winning BGs with only healers, or tanks.
---
Hide and seek with 1 Rogue/night elf in 1 zone and however many searchers you want.
---
Well, then it wasn't as evident, but the majority of content were always tedious grinds. Today it's the dailies, then it were the dungeons (I don't know how many times I've completed Strath and Sholo then...) and such.
---
Furbolg transformation
---
The shaman is getting slaughtered by the warrior though, and has no way to escape. Meanwhile the Paladin has the bubble and better mitigation.
---
If the shaman gets caught with a Pummel it's probably game over, and the initial burst typically won't kill the Paladin.
---
Can we get a larger list? Only a month to prep left and i haven't brushed up on any of jokes.

No it changed somewhen to bfa
---
I believe the benefit falls off hard at 308, meaning a human rogue only gets +3 sword skill that benefits it. While this definitely still makes it the best race for Alliance rogues, it's not so much of a difference that others can't be played as is the case for Warriors.
---
That’ll be me.
---
I'd argue that outside of world firsts and speed runs, yes. If you truly want to min/max and be the best you can, absolutely go for the human racial but if you want to pvp at any length the gnome racial will prove itself far more useful.
---
Upvoted because "hoobajoops" are your chef?

Yes.

I started my guild website mainly to share adventures. So far only my 1-10 leveling story is available (from during the open beta), but i will be adding our actual guild stories when classic launches.

I remember reading all the "from rags to riches" leveling/guild adventure blogs back in vanilla/tbc so I'm attempting to recreate - or rather recapture that feeling.  
---
It is https://www.goblinrocketfuelrats.com if anyone is curious.
---
We do have a guild information page for any future members, but aside from these pages I think many players would be turned off by the idea of mandating a website use for their members.

Playing on a tbc place I'm a new 70 getting geared through heroics and kara, still have this trinket equipped for mana restore. It's amazing!

LW gives some nice updates during leveling, but after lvl 50 it depends too much on rare reciepes.

Now I can spend time trolling the web/playing games while they play in the room or watch me and hang out.   
---
I get to do 3 things at once.

Be present and around them.    
---
Be online.

---
My daughter loves watching me play games and we talk while I do.     
---
Its a fair compromise , as I just can't bring myself to sit for hours at my PC while my kids play.     
---
This way you get 1-2 hours a day with them. Then another 1-2 after they go to sleep.    
---
That's 2-4 hours a day, 14-28 hours a week on wow.   
---
That's pretty good if you ask me.   
---
(Bonus: while playing by yourself have a podcast or lecture playing , something you can learn or think/tall about with your wife).   
---
TLDR: Basically just try and double up your Wow playing with something others can partake.

Gnome warriors are absolute reavers in PVP. When I see one with a big ass 2-hander, I just go the other way.
---
Lmao this dude is nutty. Bringing American politics into his shitty WoW thread. 
---
You’re a child and I hope mommy takes away your computer privileges for a while after this. You can cry to her how unfair it is, she’ll maybe give more shits about your caterwauling than anyone here or in Classic.
---
Gnome warrior off tank collecting gear that is sub optimal for humans is the best.
---
Imagine being this upset that you have to post about it. Im pretty sure thats more cringe.
---
Rolling a gnome is generally accepted as a pvp-oriented choice. 
---
But if you plan to do PvE... chances are that you will be asked to use Deviate Fish delight or whatever and turn into human anyways to avoid healer LoS issue.
---
I’m in a very similar situation with my 15 month old son. Made a deal with my wife that I’ll be allowed to raid twice a week. It’s all about finding a good balance. The family should always come first but it’s important to have some ”free” time as well.
---
GJ again, gold video next? Are you going to.make any PvP tips or such?

Lets do Classic for 2 years then WoW 2 comes out.

---
This is the best comment
---
It would all come down to classic’s. If 1-2 million people are subbed for classic then it’s not crazy to make a separate expansion for it.
---
Looks like someone is salty they are still alone in life just like the first time they played vanilla
---
I actually plan to create a guild named real life npc's or some shit and make events for ppl. I have a few event ideas but I'll probably won't have time to do it. If anyone steals the idea remember funkydwarf was the OG npc.
---
So, can you offer some insight as to the benefits of the specs relative to each other? I’m guessing that PI priest will have lower dos than catform Druid, but may offset that with greater raid wide damage buff and have an quicker, easier time alternating dps with healing.
---
While catdriud has higher personal dps and less raid wide benefit and has a tougher time switching from do’s to heals?
---
Is the moon glow Druid last on the list of dps? Do they bring something the above specs don’t?
---
In my experience, without really working too hard on it, I've had about 2-300g at 60, but that is with being frugal and not spending carelessly. I'd you work the auction house a bit and get lucky with good drops along the way, you may be closer to 4-500. If you're speed leveling, you may have less than 100?
---
the Black Dragon Mail set is a very nice set to make at 60, I think pre-raid BiS for many slots:

How dare you ask this question.... gnome is clearly the superior race.

Did you know, relative to their size, gnomes have the largest penis length on Azeroth ?
---
Chinas hope u mean.
---
Exactly, Druids.
---
One of the benefits of questing across all zones is that you get plenty of chances to level up gathering professions. While testing out my guide in the Beta, I actually mined along my route, temporarily dropping it for skinning when I went to Teldrassil, then picking it back up when I left, smelting the copper I’d previously mined to quickly get back up to speed. I was able to get enough ore to level up blacksmithing and complete the two optional blacksmithing quests by level 17.

All I can think of is Monty Pythons Hide-and-Seek Olympic final
---
Like others have said, teldressil is nice. But I find the zone kind of annoying to run around, and darkshore, the zone after, is dreary and not so nice. But many people will travel to Elwynn at this point. 
---
My vote would be elwynn, it's got the most complete feeling storyline and the music is very good. Its bright and inviting. And because it's all human-based, it feels sort of like your average medevial fantasy, which feels very engaging given most people's experience with LOTR or GOT. 
---
If you play Horde, my vote would be Durotar or Mulgore. It really just depends on you and your girlfriends aesthetic preferences. I think the undead starting zone and Brill are quite fun, but it's not a classically beautiful landscape and maybe not the most fluid in terms of questing. Elwynn's quest lines are very natural feeling. If I didnt play Horde I would be playing a human. Or run a dwarf to Elwynn to start :P

Then you'll also never see inside of a raid bby xoxo

End game is meh, ill get there eventually and maybe or maybe not "beat" it all.
---
If you take leveling away then you may as well cut out 90-95% of all game content, maps, etc. 
---
You basically just want 1-4 zones @ max level from the get go
---
Each expansion would delete the older expansion.
---
Good old Vis Maior, was fun facing them back in the day
---
Don’t worry brother. Classic is soon and that feeing of being better then other people cause we don’t have lives and can get more loots is almost here.
---
I’m not sure why people take this as an assault on their favorite class.
---
Edit flair on the right sideof the page.
---
1080p for 800€ should be enough, to be honest. So no need to look for anything particular. Even an ultra book would be ok, as long as cooling is good enough. I have a Zenbook UX303L from 2015, with a Geforce 840M, for example. It looks nice and is thin, yet you can play on it.
---
For those of you commenting on my cable management, trust me I know it sucks lol. I have been meaning to clean it up. Does anybody have tips or different kits they’ve used for cable management! Any help is appreciated
---
Its already full of this shit and then some this sub is the epitome of cringe.
---
That's how it is already. Nobody gives a fuck about previous expansions or even the previous patch. All that's relevant is the current raid and dungeons. That's the game.
---
I dont have much experience with paladin, how  come you dont take Kings when moving down the prot tree? Are you generally sticking to Might or something else?
---
&gt; At the risk of sounding repetitive, TBC was fun but it set us on the path that brought us to modern WoW.
---
But the fact that it set up that path doesn't in any way detract from it's own inherent value. If TBC was fun, why does it matter if five years down the line it lead to the game being bad ? If they just release TBC and don't release further expansions it's a complete non-issue. 
---
You can compare it to something like obesity. You're basically saying "Having that first candy put me down this path of becoming obese, so I shouldn't ever have eaten it". But there's absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying a few candies now and then, as long as it stays that way.
---
&gt; 1) Do I need to do anything to set up a bank alt? Can I just create them and not even log in? Planning on using the mail system to store stuff.
---
90% sure you dont even need to login, yes. Worse case you can just login for a second.
---
2) How do I know what items to vendor and what to AH? Is it just all cooking supplies and gems?
---
Experience/addons.
---
Well, there is Memoria. Automated screenshotting every time you level and I think every time you kill a boss. So those kinds of achievements are covered by that.
---
[https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/memoria](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/memoria)
---
Mentions in the comments that it will be coming to classic too. It's not perfect, and UI elements might not be forthcoming but at least you'll have the screenshots of those things.
---
First view!
---
Yes, waiting a few weeks may be profitable. You might want to create bank alts to store that stuff and manage AH transactions.
---
If I were you I would frame it!

The closer you get to Ragnaros, the more you will burn. So melee classes usually take a lot more fire damage.

All I want is to play a real MMORPG again. Not a Casino shoot and loot, which is what reatail has become.

---
Any tips or kits you’ve used ?
---
It's negligible when you realise 40-mans are full of people half-assing it and just playing your class to its full potential is way more important than 5 weapon skill.
---
With the exception of the Main Tank. Like it or not every person edging that threat meter desperately want to MT to max as much as (s)he can.
---
Of course it is. You can even see most pictures have a sloppy guy handwriting that they try to cover up but aren't fooling anyone.
---
Yeah, so that's true but what you do is die in an opportune spot.
---
So for example if a troll/Orc jumps the wall and gets the ratchet flight path, if you start walking towards xroads, you only need to walk about a third of the way there and get killed by a mob to essentially "jump forward" to the crossroads and spirit res with no penalty. Rinse and repeat to camp t, mukgore, and even tb. Works in both directions.

Did I remember right that emails can be saved as items? Can they be traded? They could provide clues / proof of visiting location.
---
Ask the devs of the game not me. Lmao. I just had an opinion.
---
I mean - perhaps the matchup of shaman + paladin vs warrior + paladin is more of a tossup.  But Warrior + paladin is still a better duo overall because they are better at beating other duos.  If shamans had magic cure it might be different, but they don't.
---

---
The only way I see this word being applicable to classic is if there are guilds that form with the criteria "you must have never played classic before." The vast majority of guilds are going to clear MC/BWL etc the first or 2nd time going into them, assuming standard 3-4 hour raids.
---
There is a classic setting in the video options.
---
So you're not even playing the game but feel like anyone should listen to your opinion?
---
If your raid has 4 locks bringing a shadow priest will grant the raid 200+ dps in mc and up to 400+dps in naxx from weaving alone.  The priest will bring 200-500 dps depending on content so overall it is very comparable dps putting them just below the melee.
---
Wait, you can actually play with the modern graphics?
---
I vaguely remember one about noobs and rouges being similar because they both pick locks but I'd like to be reminded of it and some better ones so a list would  be sweet
---
damn carl’s jr. expensive af
---
Dwarf rogue or gnome lock, both are awesome / good.
---
U just jelly af
---
If it's the new model of Macbook Air, then yeah it will be playable at very low graphics settings probably around 15-20 fps. Which is terrible but I mean that how a lot of us actually played the game 12+ years ago
---
How PUG-able do you think MC and BWL (to a lesser extent) are? 
---
And assuming they are, how long would a full clear take, i.e. would it be doable in a single session?
---
Level 55-60 zones and zones where lvl 60 dungeons and raids are located. And capital cities. People complaining about the map shrinking don't seem to get that it's because the new map only covers 10 levels. Azeroth might be 3 times bigger but it covers 1-60 vs only 60-70 in TBC. 
---
You also had to go back to the old world for some things. Some vanilla consumes were still better. ZA. CoT. Karazhan. That's 3 raids out of 7 located in the old world, as well as one dungeon hub out of 5. 
---
And yeah, level 70s would just speed through the zone using flight paths and mounts to get to their destination, but that was always the case in vanilla too. No one is stopping to grind some level 40 ogres on their way to Dire Maul.
---
What do you mean. Typical undead rogue players were too bad and couldn't gank people at level 60 since they would lose the fight. It was only in TBC that the power gap was large enough, so they could win.
---
This
---
Can confirm.
---
That's the thing that sticks out.
---
You can just 
---
/world "Hey, one paladin up to wreck some people in the world?"  
---
Most paladins will be in holy anyways and tier gear is not really tailored to PvE, so PvP enthusiastic paladins will grab them a lot while PvE paladins will go for stuff like Salamander Scale Pants.
---
Therefore you have holy paladins with their best PvP spec (holy) like sand on the beach.
---
Finding elemental shamans currently specced into elemental as they raid as resto who aren't roaming with a set group of people is a lot more difficult. And it's harder to get great PvP pieces as elemental shaman.
---
Devouring plague is great for spreists. It has a high mana cost so it’s not the best for PVE but it whoops ass in PVP
---
And here we see the real problem with Retail wow. Not that it exists, not that some people enjoy it, but that it - rather like American culture - cultivates this kind of mindset. This person here doesn’t know what meaning is, because his only experience with it has always been spoon fed him. He’s never gotten to decide much, instead he’s been put on a road and learned to stick the course. There is no adventure, and thus little to no joy in this poor, poor person, who is far to lost in going straight.
---
I've been in my guild as a gnome fury warrior for several months. They know I'm willing to pursue Edgemaster's in order to make it work. I doubt they'd ever let me be MT or OT though as a gnome. Especially when every other warrior in our guild is human lol.
---
it’s release for premium customers, only $39.99
---
Look at laptops with nvidia 1050ti graphics cards in them. Should play classic perfectly
---
As a general note, you could add to always keep random **BoE bracers "...of the frozen wrath" (+ frost spell dmg)**, at least for items for level 30+, as they likely will be better than any other pre-BWL choice for frost mages (= all mages) and have the potential to go for a lot of gold, while looking just like another worthless random drop!
---
I don't know if there are similar examples for other classes/speccs?
---
Alliance warlocks do more dps throughout the game from salvation and still win in pvp if skilled.  Also lets you play more burst heavy conflag in premades since you don't have elemental shamans for burst.
---
The one complaint I have with their class design is that TBC Enhancement Shaman completely threw out the previous ideas of 1H + Shield tanking builds or having a gigantic badass 2H axe in favor of...dual wielding two puny-sized hammers. Never really liked that decision, they should have at least tried to make Enhancement tanking or 2hander playstyles work.
---
Dwarf is the best choice bar none if you’re min maxing.

Human is dope if you’re into rep grind stuff.

Night elf is fun for shadowmeld shenanigans.

I think it's the model from a couple years ago, not sure.

The lore has changed a lot the last 15 years, what is canon today was not necessarily canon in vanilla and I don't know if there is anyone that makes lore videos without the changes from modern books.

If you can live with the lore being influenced by modern canon you can watch nobbel87 he makes great lore videos.

It'll be rough then. Classic is easy to run, but those laptops have no dedicated graphics processing at all so it's very demanding on the little laptop

&gt;It's this idea that everyone have a right to see the content if they cannot put in the work that really killed wow for me
---
You will not clear anything besides Kara and a few easy T5 bosses if you don't invest significant time and effort into the game in TBC. What you're describing is LFR. TBC raiding was no cake walk. If anything, it increased complexity in raids, it didn't decrease it.
---
Take skinning+mining or herbalism even if you want to go engineer/tailoring/alchemy and send your mats to an bank alt.
---
Get an auction addon + vendor addon that shows you the sell price from quest rewards (weapons give you the most cash). 
---
Grind some farm spots while leveling, for example elemental fire for fire protection potions every guild will buy for MC progression @ level 25 / 38 / 50+ in different spots.
---
Prices will be much lower in the first 1-3 months depending on the item. Save them in your bank, if there is high demand, but a low price.

TBC brought Arena, which I would love. TBC was my favorite time of the game, albeit very close to vanilla. I have a few friends who are going to play classic wow, partly due to see if that will have any influence on Blizzard creating classic TBC.
---
You will also never get past BWL.
---
Yeah, runs like shit. Everytime I log in it takes ages to load all the textures and stuff and when I join a dungeon group it loads forever and everyone else is already fighting mobs when the game has finally loaded for me. But leveling alone is alright.
---
"Actually pretty decent" bro escape artist is indisputably top 3 pvp racials and arguably the best for premades because it's more reliable than hardiness and lower CD than wotf.
---
TBC was good. It could have been better. And it set a bad precedent of shrinking the world, throwing out the old, etc.
---
I hear many people talk about the raids and the classes of TBC. That is a steep cost at the death of the world. Imagine having those improvements but with a huge vibrant world? That is what this post is about.

True, I've heard that the raids are fun in retail, but people overlook the community aspects of MMOs. Retail to me just seems like a third person Diablo or PoE. Where you just log in going for iLevel +1 gear in LFR/G. 
---
On a side note it is also missing the RPG elements that made it a good game in the first place. Imbalance is needed because it adds a uniqueness to all classes. All the classes feel basically the same. They all have DoTs, single target damage spells, AoE spells, CC, CC breaks, mitigation CDs, DPS CDs. It is almost not even an RPG anymore. 
---
Also the loot going is just too RNG. Almost as bad as Archeage.

Congrats on your progress. Also I did not find your style of writing annoying or anything but I guess some people get really up over these things.

Some quick question about mounts and riding skill.
---
Each race has its own riding skill; horse riding, ram riding, wolf riding, etc.. And with some riding skills being unable to some races; Dwarfs and gnomes are the only ones who can learn mech-riding, and taurens not being able to learn  anything but kodos (and wolves?)
---
Anyway..  if Im a human, do I have to be exalted to learn another riding skill? for example; exalted with darnassus to learn tiger riding?
---
Do I need the specific type of riding skill to ride the PvP mounts?
---
Thing is that these narcissistic posts clog up the boards, turning them into circlejerks devoid of any meaningful discussion.

Plus it's not entertaining. I'd honestly have read low-effort memes than seeing pictures of some retard who got a fucking video game symbol tattooed on his/hers leg.

Troll is great. They get the only healing reduction in the game besides mortal strike, and the shadow armor is good damage and stuns with constant uptime. In pvp berserking is when you will actually see the benefits of that low hp cast speed, which can make the difference in topping yourself off or finishing a kill.
---
People talk about strong CDs of other races, but something that is constantly up and useful against all classes  means a lot more to your bottomline.
---
Kek
---
Aye instant provided you’re within 10 yards and if you’re not you can somehow get within 10 yards without the shaman noticing you not healing and running towards him while he heals, kites and nukes from 30+ yards.
---
Now I'm reconsidering priest
---
Unless you literally need to be the top of the meters to get raid loot then it is negligible, yes.
---
That's an entirely different point.
---
Don't move the goal posts.
---
My point is flying didn't kill world PvP because it was already dead.
---
Worth the price, reward the work.
---
Quit projecting
---
I don't think you'd even attempt to kill the Paladin though. Seems like it would be better to try and burst the ally warrior after you lock the Paladin's Holy school.
---
The big difference between the matchup is the burst potential. A Naxx geared shaman/war duo could insta-gib an arms warrior with a bit of luck. A Chain Lightning &gt; NS Lightning Bolt &gt; Earth shock &gt; Fire Nova Totem with a SP trinket and NAC active is doing most of the warrior's HP by itself if you get even one crit. Add onto that the horde Warrior's MS, WW and I can't see much surviving that. Especially if the Sham and War both use Engi bombs.
---
You're essentially comparing the damage of a single geared MS warrior to the damage of a geared Ele Shaman + MS warrior.

---
Want to level with friends, but we want to play different races (Orc/troll and Tauren). 
---
I was thinking the Orc/Troll players could simply run to the Tauren zone at level 1 and then start questing/leveling. Is this feasible? Will the Tauren quests be available to Orc/Troll?
---
Would it be smart to have the Orc/Troll players die, and then run in ghost form to the tauren starting zone? There is no rez sickness under level 10 right?
---
good pally. now spam those flash heals and buff me with wisdom

This definitely happened in Vanilla, it's not exclusive to modern WoW. The difference is that if they act like twats they've just ruined their rep a bit on the server, in modern WoW there's no real accountability.
---
I love you try-hards. Naxx was cleared with boomkins, ferals and ret pallies in the group. I'm sure pretty much every single guild could bring a few offspecs, a few pallies in plate and still crush every single raid.
---
Classic raids are not hard. Period. The difficulty is the organisation and the logistics. If you have competent players, it doesn't matter at all if everyone is wearing full BiS or not. But you just keep telling yourself that you have to play 18h+ per day to even have a chance at getting a raidspot, it'll be funny to see you burn out and/or ignore your whole real life in order to be the very first to beat a 15 year old raid.
---

Another suggestion: see if your wife is fine with a once a week game day where you play wow immediately after work until you go to sleep. I plan on going to a friends house straight from work one day every other week so we can really get into a grind.
---
As a casual rogue/paladin main, what addons will be necessary/useful when it comes to playing my classes more efficiently?
---
Also LoH
---
No they drop from Fankriss in AQ40 and are BiS before T3 for all healers. And if you pass on upgrades because of their looks then I seriously doubt you'll get 4H down.
---
Yes, because Classic raids are soo damn hard. Get a grip, kid.
---
Sorry that I forgot the mandatory /s for you humourless wet wipes
---
You dont need the reputation to ride the pvp mounts. There's a few other exceptions, like the tiger from ZG.
---
He can heal without wearing a dress, you know?
---
That music makes it very hypnotic and enjoyable.
---
And it's still an extremely niche game, it doesn't even break 100k player base
---
I’m huge for cosmetics, and will likely sacrifice a bit to make my Hpally look “decent”
---
Unless I’m doing endgame content, then.... I guess I’m wearing pink, baby. 
---
If you don’t like me in my stylized, you don’t deserve me in my optimized. :P
---
I don't even have a wife but if that shit gets upvotes I'll be sure to forge a couple dozen
---
then go gnome. classic raids aren't that hard anyways. sword specialization is rarely going to make or break a raid. you're giving up escape artist- the best pvp racial for warriors alliance-side while still being useful in pve, for sword specialization- which gives a marginal dps increase on raid bosses. and the difference is even less relevant after you get edgemasters or maladath.
---
only go human imo if you want to main tank as that's when the increased damage and threat generation from your racial is really going to matter and help the whole raid do more dps, and because there's a lot of competition to be main tank also.
---
I'd pay $399.99 in a heartbeat.
---
Min/maxing down to your race choice is dumb. Any race can do anything in the game. Anyone who says different is just talking out their ass.
---
You are so wrong.

MC can be done easily with a pug. BWLs first couple bosses will be pretty hard with a bunch of randoms.
---
Not a real class !!!11 
---
;-) 
---
Get the water totem trinket thing, and the other stuff from the "all" section
---
Creed one is so fitting, hahah
---
I believe in classic when you spirit Res it pulls you back to the graveyard where you first entered ghost form. This is to stop you doing exactly this.
---
Much better to run to Org and take the zeplin to TB if you want to start in the same zone.
---
Or they know that this is not fucking facebook.
---
The Weapon Skill doesn't matter much because you get a free 5 from talents so the difference is negligible.  The weapon skill doesn't effect daggers and serves no purpose in pvp.  Stoneform &gt; perception.  For rogue all alliance races serve a purpose and none are bad / worse.
---
Ignore everything about how you're typing, that shit does not matter. Great progress OP and keep it up, it's not an easy thing to change habits around and pick up regular exercise. You're doing a great thing for yourself (not just your family) and I'm glad you're feeling better. See you in Azeroth soon!
---
Yep, you don’t take resurrection sickness early on and gear damage is a non factor as well. So jumping off the zeppelin is a good time saver.
---
Guilds often run PUG spots on their binding runs
---
Left pauldrons still too small
---
No to arena, it ruined PvP with its pillar-humping and class balance. Perhaps with no rewards or balancing done for it.
---
Other than that, I agree; I'd love to see Classic+, and the only way I'd touch TBC is if I was in a raiding guild that killed Kel'thuzad and wanted to do the TBC raids.
---
Good for you man. One step at a time
---
You're right, in my mind I'm thinking of my original wow stint (years long obsession), of which more time was spent at end game TBC than vanilla endgame. 5-man TBC content was excellent and challenging.
---
:)
---
Same! [serious]
---
Please let us know what server and name/class you will play.
---
So I played a gnome warrior for a long time and I enjoyed it. It was so much fun in pvp to run Into a warzone and come out alive with bodies laying around you. But, LoS is huge in PVE and especially in BFA I was getting stuck in a lot of areas. I swapped to human and I have enjoyed it because it feels so classic to me. I mean what’s more plain than white bread? A human warrior. I loved my gnome warrior but I will roll Human in classic.
---
Also you’re a smaller target/hit box
---
When did he get changed from rare to quest npc? do you know if he has the modified loot table in 1.12?, if not there is no way to get the shield.
---
Do you wear shoes inside your house?!?
---
I feel personally attacked
---
That's like saying the helmet is negligible as a gear piece because some people in your raid wont be using consumables anyway.  In other words, it's nonsense. 
---
In no world is 5 weapon skill "negligible" in raiding.  It's 3% hit, parry / dodge reduction, and a big increase in white damage.  (roughly 5% overall white damage).
---
No
---
In current meta you use a disc priest
---
That specified shadow
---
Also I’m talking about pvp.
---
Shadow priests oom after one fight
---
i wasnt disagreeing with better pieces of gear coming mostly arround AQ40 i was disagreeing with the notion of them not beeing viable in pvp before that.
---
This is accurate for my first Tinder date too.
---
&gt;kid

&gt;

&gt;kid
---
Fucking hell, are you an overcompensating 12 year old?
---
Optimal play is not necessary, but it's required by any decent guild because of the social ramifications of accommodating slackers. By the way, I can tell that you don't know anything about playing a holy paladin just from the image you posted. 
---
Little piece of advice, you put too much emphasis on crit. It's always better to actually calculate stat benefits instead of looking at talents, going "OOOH CRIT IS SUPER GOOD FOR ME IMMA JUST STACK CRIT" and ignoring the relative benefits of different stats.
---
These profession caps seem to make 39 a nice twinkling level, especially for classes with run speed forms&amp;buffs... Druid, Shaman, Hunters, etc
---
You won't hit 30 launch day so windfury will have to wait an additional day.
---
Mind flay slows, you have a silence also. Fear will work on everything that isn't undead and you have shackle for those. I used to massive circle kite on priest to level.
---
It's like mage aoe farming but you just dot and run in a circle and wand every once in a while and just pile up mobs.
---
End game starts while you are leveling once in your 50s you will be getting gear that you will be walking into mc with or pvping with. Be prepared for how long things take. You will spend 10+ days of PLAYED time just leveling. It will take you months after you ding 60 just to get a full set of epics. Epics meant something back then. Enjoy yourself and remember the spirit of vanilla was the experience and the journey not the end goal. The point wasnt to finish content and wait for blizzard to make you more the point was to make your own content. Many peoples fondest memories of vanilla was just doing dumb shit like tm vs southshore or griefing chinese gold farmers in tyrs hand or spending an hour and a half fighting something solo that was never meant to be fought solo because pallys are op. So just try and find some dumb shit to do and have fun.
---
Gnomes can get it at level 30.
---
It's not much, but I made a Thrall plushie for my BF :3 Hope Reddit likes it!!!
---
&gt; With that said - don't get taken advantage of either. They need to be willing to do the same for you.
---
Thank you for explaining the last part of the statement for those that didn't understand :)
---
Turn everything to low and you will be find. Is your PC upgradable?
---
Finally the dedication this place needs. No more of that "I can only play 6 hours day" crap.
---
2 weeks?!
---
Me too... TBC FTW
---
Will I have time to be a main tank in a reasonable raiding guild with a new born son?
---
And you arent, what he is saying is that no matter what there's a high chance of you 5 guys creating problems in the guild youre going to join, even though youre going to play a high dps class, it might be amplified by the fact that you will play a high dps class, since then you might decide that you wanted 1 item and didnt get it, so you tell your 4 healer friends that this is a shit guild and then you all leave or dont raid so the whole guild is fucked, or on the opposite side the guild feels that they have to give you the gear because otherwise they lose 4 healers and then the other dps who shouldve gotten then item gets pissed and leaves because the guild is playing favourites. 
---
Its cool that you have 4 friends that you can play with, but you're fucking yourselves so hard when you choose to be 4 healers, since 1 it wont be easy to find a guild that has 4 healer spots and when you do, youre going to create major drama. And you will ofc have a hard time doing dungs since you dont have any dps and you just might have a tank if you go warrior.
---
You forgot your /s to prevent the nerdrage
---
10% less if Human :)
---
Do you know if we will have the option to turn off XP gain?  
---
Or will we slowly level
---
Straight up play what you want. I was going to play a priest because I was thinking about raiding and late game content. Don't. Play the game you want to play, because this time it's about a journey, not just trying to catch up.
---
I'm probably gonna play on whatever server ma boi Asmongold is rolling on so I can /follow him and show up on the streams :DD
---
Sounds like you're clear on what the options are and what you want. You're not on the fence because there doesn't seem to be any other alternative that comes close to what you think will work best.
---
I have a saying "Make a choice and then make it the right choice". Every day we make millions of different choices, many which might be suboptimal, but then we find a way to make the choices good enough.
---
If you're keen on your EP/GP system then go for it. Plan for the challenges you will face, like getting people to install the correct addon, communicate clearly on what your exceptions are and why, a fair bonus points system with a solid feedback loop for what's working and what's not working, etc.
---
I wasnt aware of it. In my native language it's not that bad. I was already instructed about it here in this topic, hehe :)
---
meh I give up, it's like talking to a load of low IQ snails.
---
What about just meeting in the barrens at level 10?
---
oh that's really cool, that'd be alot of fun   
---
sorta makes me wish my buddies weren't rolling horde again xD
---
Can't agree, it's debatable.
---
Actual sperg
---
I bet he's made a lot of "friends" at his gym with this shirt
---
I don't care what people are posting really. It's what people upvote. Reddit is supposed to be a self-sorting list of interesting/relevant/funny/whatever stuff this subreddit does. I don't care about what goes on in the life of people posting here, as someone else said: it's not fucking facebook. I want posts here to be about the game, not about a cake someone made that happens to have a symbol from the game on it. 
---
I understand if people disagree with me, and actually like that sort of content (obviously they do, seeing the upvotes). But just like they are allowed to like it, I am allowed to dislike it.
---
Thank you :)
---
See you in Azeroth!
---
That's the thing, i do want to MT a raid. This decision is truly ripping my soul apart.
---
Hahahah nice
---
Would explain all those recent compliments he got at the gym
---
no the window they're talking about would lead you into the lave if you dont have the attunement.
---
If youre coming down the chains, and see the person that teleports you to mc, there will be a door to the right, a couple of meters before youre at the person. when you stand at the person and look left, you'll see the window
---
That's so funny. You think he will roll a dps class when he realizes only resto gets invites?
---
He's doing the exact same thing he did before.
---
It's a fucking meme, my dude
---
I mean, the community aspect missing is only partly true. Server communities might not be a thing anymore, but there are plenty of things like guild communities and class discord communities, for example.
---
Yes, it's possible to play the game without having to interact with a single person if you want, but that's the same for classic. The difference in retail is that you'll still get to see the dungeon and raid content, which you wouldn't in classic.
---
If you want to see the real endgame content in retail however, which is mythic raiding, you will have to interact with people in a community, just like you would in classic.
---
As far as missing RPG elements and classes feeling the same is debatable. As far as raiding goes, you could make that argument for classic too, as a mage and warlock are basically the exact same, while in retail, even just a fire mage and a frost mage play very differently, not to mention compared to another class.
---
As far as pvp goes I agree though, every class feels pretty similar because of blizzard's focus on balance around arena, with every melee having a million gapclosers and casters being just as tanky as a plate user.
---
I also agree that loot has gotten way too RNG and I would absolutely welcome it if they dialed it back a bit.
---
My bad I assumed you were a native English speaker.
---
Someone pin this thread
---
Thank you :) I like to write correctly so it's better to know that this habit of mine may be annoying to some people (and that it's not annoying to others hehe :P thanks )
---
Tanking was a lot of fun in Vanilla so I'm definitely rolling a warrior again for Classic. I have two leveling buddies with me so it should make 1-60 experience a little less daunting.
---
UGH
---
stfu I donated 50% of my monthly income to him and I'm gonna take a loan from the bank to give him some more next month
---
That's true. You just gotta be careful not to fall into a habit and do it before raid damage comes out. Done this more than I'd like to admit lol.
---
My wifes half-orc son Darrell La'Gorok Hellcleave saw this post and came crying, what you are doing is hateful and to be honest kind of a dick move. Please remove this post or my Goblin lawyers will take everything you own, Thank you.
---
Yes actually.
---
Don’t forget the Tauren /moo!
---
Its pretty selfish to deny people who enjoy TBC over Vanilla. Its really the same thing as retailers saying no to Classic players over the years, because its something they don't like/want because they already have their enjoyment.
---
Some people love TBC more than vanilla. You can write up everything you think was wrong with the game yet some people enjoy it much more. I'm personally of the opinion they should go up to WOTLK with this *classic* revival as once you get past WOTLK it's when you can clearly see the newer world in retail. Questing changes dramatically, new features that are still used in current wow today etc...
---
This all depends on the success of the projects. If classic is underwhelming don't expect TBC.
---
C r I n G e
---
The Paladin can bubble for 12 seconds. The Shaman won't survive for that long.
---
After that is warrior+pala vs warrior
---
Taking a dump right now. Thank you for the cold truth..
---
He is still working on AAP. Above 34 wasn't even finished for all classes. Expect it to be ready on Classic launch. It has been a great tool in Legion &amp; BfA for effective leveling (as long as you didn't have any insane strats yourself).
---
I will miss xmogs...
---
Bgs gives no exp
---
Hmm how about “But” and “Whole” ?
---
Gnome has always been a smaller model in vanilla
---
it's because reddit is full of f*gs
---
GL finding a person who will play the shadow weaving disc build, it's trash and less fun then wingclip nightfall.  It's not efficient at all and arguably worse then just bringing a single shadow priest.
---
An energy timing addon for the rogue. Paladins benefit from buff management addons.

night dragon's breath or runes 2 min cd

2h enhancement was viable in tbc, they really destroyed it with wotlk when lava lash became a thing
---
Hah! I could not have illustrated my point better if I had hacked your account and written those words myself.
---
That sounds super weird tbh
---
If the game is out why would I be on Reddit
---
Mmos were better imo when you had to use every method to attain levels.
---
Modern wow and ffxiv just hand you everything.
---
Grinding is ok.
---
&gt; kill me 
---
I'm trying, but you're 5 levels above me and you keep dodging and parrying.
---
Back then, I didn't really know of challenges like this. It wasn't "a thing" as far as I knew. It literally was just something I did as I played the game. But as I kept going, eventually I did decide which spec I would want to play and knew which tree I wanted to spend my points in, but I was enjoying the challenge and everything that came with it so just decided to hold off on spending the points as long as I could.
---
Starting my first few characters, I never planned it going in, it just happened. It was kind of an "I already got this far, I might as well see how far I can go" sort of thing. Then it just became a personal challenge to myself to see how far I could go. After that, I started doing it on my other characters too. Though not all of them made it as far due to me succumbing to peer pressure when leveling with friends who wanted me to spend my talents so things would go faster.
---
How many people plan to level cooking?
---
I see so few people talking about it, but the food buffs at end game are incredible!
---
I might prioritize it above my main professions.
---
Hey, no kink-shaming
---
Same story for me.
---
&gt;Honestly speaking, is rolling a Gnome warrior really THAT bad? 
---
A lot of min-maxy type people would consider gnome the best warrior race on Alliance. 
---
Warrior racials are not needed even for very hardcore raiding. Unless you are going for speedruns or dps whoring, it's almost completely irrelevant. It is true that the human racial is a not insignificant damage increase, but a lot of other things way overshadow that difference in a normal raiding scenario. You also have the benefit as a gnome of being able to use any weapon, not just swords and maces. Which helps your raid distribute loot more effectively. 
---
However, in PvP things are different. Racials can actually be the difference between living and dying in a lot of scenarios. And the gnome racial is incredibly useful for a warrior. Gnomes and dwarfs certainly have the best PvP racials for a warrior.
---
I used to organize scavenger hunts for my guild actually. All I would do is go to a random ass town in a random zone and buy like 6-7 items there. Then I would give the rest of the guild the ‘shopping list’ and the first one to be back with all the items was the winner. We would have prizes ranging from items to gold and people would love it!
---
If two mages were to fight warrior and pally with ideal specs and gear, the mages would pretty much never lose.
---
Warrior/pally are not the best duo, especially not in vanilla when PvP trinkets do not break all CCs. Duo dps with lots of cc beats any dps + healer combo.
---
That depends, as someone said, putting your kid in front of the TV for 4-6 hours just to be able to play is unethical imo. 
---
But my kids watch one-two hours of TV some days and I'm pretty sure most kids do. Every parent need to breath from time to time. So as long as it's not too much TV an hour or so should be OK. But also remember to be available when your kids seeks your attention. Could be problematic for the connection in your relationship if a kid tries to get a parents attention with no response. Things like that impact the way a person handles relation in their entire life.
---
I've got bad news, the aristocracy is over in Europe, they've swapped it into a mostly republic with emphasis on individual liberty.
---
Oh wow. I’m not even going to edit that. Let my shame be my lesson. Praise Jesus.
---
When it's released being an supporter when using historical guide is a extremely small price to pay for all the work he's done
---
Seek attention somewhere else. This isn't facebook.
---
Oh, I get it! And I love adding games into games. The urge to troll is just seductive at times. Thanks!
---
Just wait
---
Well this doesn't sound like an excellent way to get murdered at all.
---
Pk is starting a guild for classic apparently.
---
That's not what I'm saying. You can keep convincing yourself with this thread but you won't convince warriors not to go for it.
---
There are better weapons for reta/shockadins ... just like there are better weapons for warriors.
---
Its a gimmick role-play item.
---
Nice work. I enjoy the music and the fly through tour. 
---
However, I'm almost certain that your low end estimates of when each instance can be started are way off.
---
Honestly that's slightly scary and sweet at the same time. I hope you will find a warm place where you can play WoW with your future buddy:)
---
Which part do you find difficult? Basically, you take items, that are green or blue and disenchant them. By doing that you lose the items, but get magic dust or magic crystals instead. Then you take those magic materials to enchant other items with fancy stats. It is expensive to get the green/blue items, though.
---
They were literally a joke in WC3 omfg.
---
I believe handing in the token things you get do give so? But defo easy to avoid
---
I definitely will. I know I'm not gonna be speed leveling, so I want to hit 60 with max first aid, cooking, and hopefully herbalism and alchemy (or close)
---
"Back when epics were actually epic"
---
Been saying this since ... Idk but a long fuckin time.
---
Two words: Duck Tape.
---
And you think grouping/raiding with people with a meme spec is annoying.  Imagine having to carry a dude who spends no talent points.
---
I do plan to only play during rested EXP. Wife, kid, job. :(
---
Honestly curious, is it still socially appropriate to use the word "fag" in social situations where you live? I want to know the place I can SMH at.
---
I'll be honest, I'd rather them do another fresh start after Classic progression is done, but they just do it better. Instead of immediately jumping into a new custom expansion, we just get better vanilla, as you've described it. Keep the level cap, but continue rebalancing classes like they did in TBC. Fix specs that are broken, rebalance raids to raise the debuff cap so affliction and dots are viable (or whatever they did for this issue in modern wow), maybe enhance the graphics so that they keep up, but keep roughly the same old azeroth. Hell, revamping the old dungeons to have a bit more of the modern flavor of being exciting and dynamic. THAT would be classic+. 
---
Make this the last true official fresh, then do one better. And hell, if they want to start releasing expansions from there, be my guest. I just want classic wow with the class balance/viability of TBC and none of the other garbage that you've very succinctly described.
---
I don't know anything about cata rotations but I can tell you that playing rogue efficiently is much easier than playing a druid efficiently (considering that you seem to be interested in dpsing and tanking as a druid).
---
Absolutely man. May your world PVP be plentiful! Cheers!
---
Its nice to know what gear people have at a glance, ill say that. 
---
What I dont like is walking around and seeing everyone in the same armor like its a class specific uniform. 
---
Its cool early after launch because the end tier sets are rare and seeing one is a treat. But after 2 or 3 years youll get tired of seeing everyone look the same.
---
What do you mean? I'm Polish and I have no idea what you're talking about. There's little to no difference with how you use punctuation in Polish and English.
---
https://images.app.goo.gl/Fgi4kPKWtMnHEQ3N8
---
20 times? That's rookie numbers.
---
Yea TBC was pretty good spec wise
---
TL;DR
---
You're insane.
---
That's thinking progressive!
---
Raid spec holy is much better than deep resto in pvp.  Shaman war might have an edge at very high gear levels but overall it is an inferior combo.  
---
While not the same, pally wAr was much stronger at 70 in arenas as well.
---
Healbot when it comes out for classic. Great for all those paladin buffs to manage.
---
Male Tauren. What other choice do I have.
---
It's the most fun experience, but have an alt that you level up in situations where you are constantly being farmed.
---
That’s the day 85% leaves
---
It’s a nice bit more than that. To illustrate: going from 50% to 54% is 8% “more damage” as opposed to 4%.
---
My fiancé is cool with me playing as much as I want. I moved my computer set up to the living room so I can spend time with her while I play
---
Pvp
---
Further exemplifying my point that you're solely interested in arguing and ignoring context.
---
I genuinely feel for the people who have to deal with having a significant other and also a WoW addiction. Been through it and it's not a good time for either person.
---
Damn I'm jealous. My wife's boyfriend only gave me his old Wii u
---
Married man here, if my wife did something like that it'd be cool, but damn is seeing posts about it the cringiest shit ever.
---
I’m fact, it seems like a most excellent way to get deaded.
---
No, that's not how math works.
---
That is the escalation I came here for
---
Depends on how good the pug is. An experienced guild can clear MC in greens in 2 hours. A pug might spend 2 hours just on the trash.
---
You're not using the 1.12 client, you're using the 8.x client.
---
I think invisible walls would have gone against the immersion they were looking for..
---
I know this is fake from the:
---
&gt; And another friend after repeatedly losing to me in duels, checking what talents I was using to see why I kept winning, only for him to say it's glitched and not displaying properly, only to find that I hadn't spent any yet and him getting mad that I was beating him with no talents.
---
You can't check talents in any way during Vanilla.
---
If you choose to not use talent points sure, that's on you, but don't go grouping up and dragging a party down because you're inflicting a challenge on yourself.
---
I will dualbox a rogue and a mage. The mage will be my personal portal and food maker in the end. Also will act as bank char and enchanter
---
I’m offended by your use of the word “maybe” here
---
I will skill Cooking to 300. It is a free profession slot that can't be used for anything else.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the cloth turn-ins were available at launch. They don't gate any meaningful content.
---
Bhill and Tedd
---
Someone is having relationship issues...
---
More than sufficient.
---
I too am homeless. Just get a gf to do those things and crash from time to time.
---
This is the most dumb ideas I’ve heard of.
---
Was there no bank in Classic?
---
I remember playing with people that took the goggles lol
---
Never thought about the similarity between Medivh and Bran Stark
---
Does anyone remember a Zul'Gurub raid video that includes the following songs in the soundtrack? They clear most of the bosses, but I'm not sure they manage to get all of them.
---
* Groove Armada - Superstylin'
---
* Orbital - Halcyon on and on
---
* Goldfrapp - Strict Machine
---
and wasn't even born when vanilla/TBC was released xD
---
Classic will not have the same requirements as retail. Why would it?
---
They will not have the same graphical quality at all.
---
Your statement is false.
---
I just know when the game becomes available this sub reddit is going to be insufferable. "WOW I SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK AND THE TIMER SAID 30 SECONDS. BUT I TIMED IT WITH MY PHONE STOP WATCH AND IT WAS 32 SECONDS. THSI GAME IS LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE FUCK BLIZZARD AND ACTIVISION IM BOYCOTTING CLASSIC AND GOING BACK TO MY 100% BLIZZLIKE P SERVER" 
---
i see it already and it makes my skin crawl.
---
Start at $15,000,000 to play 20 days before release, then half the price every day from that (7.5 million for 19 days before release, 3.25 million for 18 days from release). You should get to $15 at 0 day from release.
---
Haters gonna hate, but Classic is life.
---
She will find a new husband, and you, a Night Elf dancing on a mailbox in Ironforge.
---
Everybody wins in the end.
---
Right, that's what I'm trying to say. Dailies and PUGing in a mostly non-immersive treadmill-world is just not fun to me.
---
This was only something I did while leveling. Always spend talents once you hit max level and never raid without talents, that's just a dick move to others. I had a group of friends for pre-60 instances. But even when grouping with randoms in lower levels I never had a problem healing or completing an instance. If I thought I was a detriment to others at any point, I would stop.
---
But this is mostly just for my own solo leveling experience.
---
Abort mission!
---
Installing, launching and logging in won't be a problem if you have Windows 10 (which most if not all have at this point) and sufficient HDD/SSD space.
---
Neither the CPU or RAM requirements will be the same, just as with GPU requirements.
---
Where do you get this from? Just because the core system is based of the Legion client?
---
I suggest that you read up on benchmarks done on the Classic beta and compare them to the retail client and then make this statement again.
---
About the DPS? Sure. You are 100% wrong about the healer though. Pre-combat hotting is a thing in classic. Some encounters require it otherwise your tank will get one-shot.
---
fabulous was a mage right?
---
Glad I could further stimulate some nostalgia, that's what this is all about!
---
There's really no need for in classic. I can understand retail but classic the mobs are actually high enough statwise to be challenging already, there's no need to handicap other than just making it less interesting to play.
---
Very well said
---
Bonnie &amp; Clyde for duo rogue names.
---
Updates. Every leveling addon made for Classic will require a ton of tweaks and updates. Like fixing steps that were wrong about a quest, incorporating class quests, profession guides, etc. These addons won't come out as finished once Classic launches that's for sure
---
Very true
---
Wow what country do they allow you to marry your left hand?
---
I never said anything about benchmarks or any performance once you're in-game. Again, if you can't play Retail, you can't play Classic.
---
You can get there without dying. Yeah, I don’t think it’s the best idea. The well quest chain is Tauren only and there are gathering quests too. Sounds a bit slow. You can probably just chill on voice chat for a couple hours until you all naturally meet up. Make sure the Tauren player gabs there’d quests in TB for everyone.
---
Why?
---
New idea - the event host chooses some random ass enemy faction player and make the event a bounty hunt mission. Could even create a whole backstory as to why this person needs to die. gold reward obviously
---
Boooo Escaper, they denied my app. I raided with Civilian and Cryhavoc during two different stints on the Horde side

Someone's a wittle envious of people who have WoW and happy love lives

When you're anticipating a slew of positive posts, and you're already announcing your negativity at the thought of those positive posts, then perhaps \*you're\* the negative one.  
---
Having said that, in the moments I'm being most self-serving, I agree with you. A part of me likes posts to be as on-topic \*and\* broadly able to be applied or related to, and posts that are very individual-specific that I can't gain from directly sometimes frustrate me. I'm also a member of the /r/bjj community, for example, and people who say, "Tried my first class today!", "Thinking about joining, what are some things that...", or even, "Got promoted to \[Insert Belt Color Here\] today!" are probably not offering \*me\* anything directly.   
---
But, if I think about the sub-Reddit as a collective, and I look past myself, I'm grateful to see people excited about the same thing as I am. Even if that means they're somewhat using my favored sub-Reddit as a diary, everything about appreciation is subjective, and so I try to see the silver lining in people sharing Warcraft-themed cakes their significant others made them with icing which reads, "Back to Azeroth!", or people's screenshots of them hitting 60 or dropping a raid boss. The only things those really offer anyone other than the O.P. is the sense of shared appreciation for the hobby itself.   
---
For a game that was dead for so long, just be grateful that it's been revived for another nostalgic go-round, perhaps?
---
I'll be leveling a druid and shaman simultaneously in Classic.  Druid for grouping with my old Vanilla buddies (they have limited playtime because of jobs &amp; families) and a shaman for playing solo.
---
Rogue is mostly cooldown management if that helps. Be warned that tanking as a druid outside of 5mans is rough and requires a lot of key items.
---
So when he hit you with it, it was always _dirty_.
---
TBC is my favorite era of the game and nothing is going to change that. Honestly this just like seems like "you think you do but you don't" all over again, except this time it's the vanilla players saying it.
---
I guess it's possible (it's a desktop PC) but considering it cost less than 300 bucks, it's not worth it
---
It's not like the cringetopia hasn't started already.
---
Use the respect instead of dropping it
---
I don't see what other duo beats a pally/warrior.  Perhaps you could elaborate.  The closest might be spriest/mage but realistically because of stun and being able to cure magic, you simply tunnel the spriest.  A mage left alone to do things vs pally/warrior is not particularly scary as long as the pally doesn't get counterspelled (which is pretty easy to juke).
---
Do you anticipate that Classic is going to end up mimicing retail's issue of DPS too heavily out-weighing other roles? I've been playing since BC, and that entire time I have refused to main a DPS-only class (Warlock, Mage, Rogue, Hunter) because of how ridiculous that ratio usually ends up being.
---
No resilience is bad because it limits your itemization options. You absolutely HAVE to raid if you want to stay competitive in PvP.
---
Compare Naxx gear to pvp gear.
---
Indeed.  If someone doesn't care about suddenly getting ganked and having their playtime interrupted by random strangers, then enjoy your PvP server.  But to a lone healer with zero interest in open world PvP it's nothing but frustration.
---
My guess is that English is not their native tongue
---
assuming there is a sufficiently powerful BoE on the line as a reward maybe. Stockade pauldrons, Lionheart Helm, Warden Staff, Titanic Leggings, something of the like. maybe even as low as like half an epic mounts worth of gold would suffice. just for "the fun of it" not a chance in hell, time is money friend.
---
Nah we can't wait till 10. Getting to 10 will probably be the first entire session we do together. Also we're all very casual so it's not like we're going to get all 5 of us to 60 or even 40 or even 25
---
"Horde good" 
---
10/10
---
Ok but then you need to understand that people who live elsewhere might not necessarily value 100k like you do.
---
Shit, I stabbed Marvin in the face...
---
Thanks! That is really important. I think I can see the hidden path to ratchet on the map.....hopefully its not too dangerous.
---
Do you know if the paths are actually safe in vanilla? Or will random mobs attack us even if we're dead center?
---
That's the one! Good memory
---
Mage would be fastest. Paladin is a little slower but you can rez your twink if they die.
---
MANY WHELPS! HANDLE IT!!!
---
Thank you for this. I'll definitely toy around with the specs to see what fits me.
---
Eh still annoying doing 5 mans with someone not pulling their weight.
---
The time investment in raiding came from farming all the ridiculous amount of consumables in vanilla. In TBC it's just pots+flask so that's not really a problem. Plenty of guilds raided 2 days a week and cleared all the content, the raids themselves don't take long unless your raid keeps fucking up in which case that's a skill problem not a time problem.
---
Could it also be profitable to buy up mats early when there isn't much demand, then sell them back in a few weeks when the prices rise?
---
That's basically all this sub is anymore.
---
Layering reeeeee
---
Blizzard's dying reeeeee
---
Rinse and repeat
---
That one got me, too. MORE LIKE THIS
---
wow good gentlesir, that's an excellent picture of your cat next to a monitor with the thing the subreddit is about on it. please take my updoots
---
At least we'd know who the famous actors/rich people are who play.
---
Yes I plan to, I won't make it a priority though as secondary professions aren't as limiting as primaries.
---
First aid while leveling, so 300 first. Then cooking. Then fishing, eventually.
---
Nope, main tank requires a LOT of work outside of raid times.
---
Nope. Just came home and wanted to take a picture. Feet for scale 😅
---
nice work man, one of my favs aswell :)
---
Yeah but no. The non meta roles wont be more common because of knowledge. They will be more common because of a lack of knowledge.
---
I'm pretty sure most of the heavy lifting user-side is in c/c++, lua is used just for small stuff, mostly around the ui (macros, settings etc.).
---
This sub Reddit has been corrupted by chaos for far too long!
---
What makes you say that? Is it the movement of retail players who will try vanilla/new players coming to try wow through vanilla?
---
If you're healing you're probably going to have way more down time, if you're tanking your healer is probably having to work a lot harder to keep you alive.  And if you are dps or even tanking you're for sure doing way less damage and making things take longer than necessary, maybe even contributing to a wipe on tougher bosses that need to be burned down faster.
---
Lol mid shit right now, you gave me a giggle
---
Won't last past Onyxia anyway, Vis'kag has 20dps more no way that's better
---
Come on man, is this fucking serious? 
---
Prioritize your family. I saw your other comment - Inconsistent play because of your family is a "difficult pill to swallow?". Grow up. If your family doesn't want you putting video games over them (DUH), then you don't do that.
---
When you decided to have a kid did you just think you were still going to spend your free time playing video games and vegging out?
---
good
---
Druid tank? Sure. No one will bat an eye in a 5-man. You'll still be regulated to offtanking in almost every guild. 
---
Paladin tank? Nope. Dungeons with them are annoying and they're not viable in raids at all.
---
yes, and fatfatty a gnome warrior, their OT, if i remember correctly. yah the nostalgia is crazy. 10 or so friends and i, are all planning on playing classic semi-seriously, should be fun.
---
Emperor forbid it
---
Those appear to be listed along side with a later expansion version of the shield.
---
While a good contender, I can't prove or deny that will be the shields only affix for dropping in Classic.
---
Can’t wait pay to secure character names/server choices etc?
---
Is that what you mean by two weeks?
---
There will be a greater proportion of players actually raiding from the get go, but people are going to be more picky about who they funnel MT gear to than ever afaik.
---
Non-meta, suboptimal, and even genuine meme-specs will be able to find a raid group. Though it probably won't be the first one they try for, and will not be given important rolls or priority on gear in a lot of cases.
---
I'd very happy offtanking, druid tanks just look so much fun. I'm just afraid people will go by hard set rules that are unmoving because of the most optimal minmaxing ideas they have
---
Its completely impossible. If you're an orc you can't EVER get exalted with undercity. Never ever ever. They'll call you a dirty orc and knock you out of Undercity.
---
Ya essentially. I've played retail on and off and a really common occurrence is tanks/healing classes that refuse to play as a tank or a healer. It's not uncommon to see a group with several healing classes looking for a healer lol. It's a different expectation coming from retail where all hybrid classes can do all things and that just isn't the case in classic.
---
This is underrated ^^ I think flight paths play crucial role in WoW players’ hygiene habits
---
That's bis even at naxx levels according to some spreadsheets
---
Lol Jesus h Christ you cannot post anything on Reddit unless it is word.perfect
---
**ITS THE 8.0 WHATEVERTHEFUCKYOUWANTTOCALLIT CLIENT AND IT WILL PROBABLY RUN BETTER ON YOUR CURRENT PC**
---
there, fixed it just for you :)
---
In raids no, 39 men people are not going to think it's funny one person wants to try some meme spec as main tank. In 5 man it will probably be fine.
---
Wife, 2 kids, job here.
---
Plan on playing about 3 hours a night as usual.
---
Increased knowledge doesn't favour the non-meta specs, it's the other way around.
---
Back in the day, there wasn't an established meta. Our increased knowledge is what CREATES the current meta. Now we KNOW that paladins a bad tanks, so prot pala becomes a non-meta spec. 
---
But considering the nature of your question, you're probably not gonna be playing in a hardcore guild, so play anything you want. Dedication to your character is more important.
---
Sure, waste time purging while warriir hamstring+MS your ass to death within Hammer of Justice
---
I use the same purple lacrosse ball to rub my foot and calf.  Is this me in another timeline? Looks like my cable management
---
Absolutely those are all ways in which you could potentially be bringing people down in those roles. But that doesn't mean it was happening. Mostly I would heal and never had issues with downtime. But this no talents thing is something I did mostly for solo leveling and I did group content with friends so it didn't really affect others.
---
I think it varies by guild. I've known healers to get a little salty if they are chugging mana pots to heal life-tapping warlocks who won't bring their own mana pots.
---
That's almost certainly below what blizzard will say the minimum specs are, but that doesn't necessarily mean it won't run the game at all if you put all the settings at their lowest. But it will take forever to start and load times will be annoying. The other concern is the parts you do have crapping out. I've always had shitty luck with old laptop hd's crashing or a stick of ram failing. If that happens it will not be worth getting a replacement part. 200 bucks can get you a cheap new laptop that will have better specs. But if you just set it up as a dedicated wow machine and have a bit of luck then it should work just for your friend to try out the game and decide if he wants to invest in a new computer.
---
99% of players don't care about min/maxing. They just want to win the encounter and receive the loot.
---
afaik you can compensate the loss of ww damage due to the faster attackspeed which results in more rage and more heroic strike spam. you dont hit hard, but you hit alot.
---
the weapon skill comensates aswell. the first record of this build was on nostralius: https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=36&amp;t=39130
---
bloodthirst and execute are unaffected by your weapon.
---
Not arguably, gnome warrior is the best choice for pvp on alliance
---
Bow? What xpac are you smoking?
---
it's a lip balm

possibly

I just have no room!

NO WE COOL. i cut a spot in the carpet for it

You can find old archives and old databases from vanilla, like [this one](http://www.gameweezle.com/wow-gold-items-20008-Astral-Guard-of-Blocking.html). There were no other affixes.

The image created by your first sentence was quite amusing

knowledge will make non-meta specs less likely.  everybody has the knowledge that these specs are bad.  in vanilla you could fly under the radar, people thought this raid was hard, no, this raid was hard because your healer was a shadow priest

Oh wow, never knew about this site, thanks for the resource.

"LF2M, tank &amp; healer" then you check the group and it's a paladin, warrior and druid.

It's still worth an absurd amount of money if you invest it, regardless of where you live.

Pretty sure gnomes can get it at level 20.
---
Have you heard anything about if &lt;Vile Thorn&gt; will be coming back for Classic? I resubbed after 5 yrs and logged onto my rogue to see they didn't exist on Defias Brotherhood anymore.
---
They're perfect in dungeons, but in raids, they just don't have the avoidance. There's no way for a Druid to ever become uncrushable and feral tank gear doesn't progress very well.
---
Private server bosses do way more damage than they’re supposed to.
---
Flotsam and Jetsam
---
Why is that first one good? Is it not wasteful to spend points only benefiting one particular demon (such as "improved voidwalker")?
---
I thought affliction was generally considered best for PVP?
---
I was also thinking about it and there are two approaches. 
---
First one: I've never been corrected in Poland for it. I know it's not grammatically good but in places like this we are using everyday language so it should be ok :) Conclusion is that English is more sensitive in this matter. 
---
Second one: If we are discussing simply a matter of grammar than 100% agree in both languages this is an error :)
---
Try again.
---
currently stuck between druid and mage, mage at first for pure pvp shenanigans with friends(Trying to hit rank 10 atleast), but over the past few days i've been thinking about 30/21 hotw/ns druid. with that' ill be able to tank/heal in most pve and flag carry/pvp pretty well all in one spec. which sounds more appealing than just being stuck with dps. also druid benefits my friends greatly.  you?
---
225+ professions require level 35
---
Rhok'Delar is BiS until Phase 2 :F

I heard he wasn't real

Just ban karma grabs and stupid pictures that have nothing to do with the game. Also definitely can cosplay and art. Before we devolve into r/wow which is 80% shitty fan art and cosplays.

Just take the L. You lost.

Is it better for 19 or 29?

Happily and with a smile i told my wife whilst we were driving one day that she needs to be " out of my way and not in my (new) computer chair when wow releases.  She says "that's scary.   im actually scared."
---
Heretic!
---
Why not both
---
Played a Druid casually, mostly tanked 5 mans. Guild asked me to join onyxia, I said I’m tank spec but knew our main tanks were going so I said I’ll dps. He said sorry we’ve got a feral dps already and could really just use a heals. My casual guild didn’t let me go feral dps against onyxia. 
---
Fun times
---
fuck you dot com
---
Great, thanks for the tip LlamaOfGod!  I'm thinking of rolling a priest as my secondary but will probably be going heavy into PvP for that char.  The spec looks interesting for sure!
---
LF GF pm me
---
Any dps class with good cc. You just keep the paladin cc'd and take out the warrior. In the case of two mages, you can honestly just pom pyro down the warrior and the pally can't do anything about it. 
---
In 2v2 or 3v3 in Vanilla, it's all about the right dps combos. Healing classes do not play a role. Healing only becomes viable in these fights when there is resilience to last through bursts. Even in TBC when resilience was introduced, dps only teams dominated 2v2s and 3v3s.
---
Is the realm list going to be out before early name creation?
---
Depends on what you define as challenging.
---
Retail low end dungeons are pathetic. Pull half the wing of a dungeon and all spam your aoe. Never once do you actually need to be careful with pulls or one mob could wipe you. And if you wipe you lose essentially nothing since the run back is non-existent. There is no risk. You don't need to interrupt. You don't need CC. You don't need to think whatsoever to achieve dungeon completion. Just spam your buttons that do damage/heal.
---
You just do. It's all go go go action game now and I fucking hate it.

I've been denied from dungeons regularly and sometimes raide as resto shaman because they wanted priests, so I've had my experience with "you're not viable enough", hence my worries

I'm saying they're both on 6s cool downs. Once you pop em both, it's best to stack sunders to dump rage until they're both off CD.

Lol I remember sitting out front of IF back in the day at like level 35. And this stupid gnome runs and jumps and does the /train emote (I didnt know what it was back then), and it caused my computer to freeze with the stupid gnome stuck on screen.

I thought he did something on purpose to make my comp crash, before I realized I just had a shit computer.

95% of the post on this subreddit are trash dude. It doesn't help to put yourself above others and deem something you find uncomfortable "cringe". Top post here are either memes, or an echo chamber of things we've already discussed 200 times. It is kind of embarrassing to read how uncomfortable you are all getting over the thought of this. I've literally seen 0 post like OP is mentioning, and you're all here projecting what you want to see. Kinda weird.

I don’t know how their shit works anymore. I didn’t see any upvotes so I made a statement. I’m really just showing appreciation for the comment.

This.
---
&gt;Gnomes and dwarfs certainly have the best PvP racials for a warrior.
---
Shadowmeld flag camping.

Yes you can absolutely MT as gnome as to clear naxx.  +5 swords is a major buff for raiding, but escape artists is the best pvp option.

Always appreciate a good "for scale". Thanks for the nostalgia hit!
---
And this trinket will never be available lol
---
No one will be here at reddit at launch
---
Great post! I'd like to add also that as a caster dps it can be useful in some encounters to be able to deal every type of magical damage. Which means for example that a warlock might want to keep a decent nature wand, frost wand and arcane wand. This is really useful for boss fights such as Ossi in aq20 that switches between different spell vulnerabilities. So keep this in mind when upgrading your wand! You might want to keep high level wands if they are from another school of magic than your upgrade. (Ofc always keep the fastest frost wand for Visc). 
---
Also I'd like to add:
---
Recipe for thistle tea - from a low lvl rogue class quest. Keep this! You can have others make this for you sure, but the recipe is irreplaceable.
---
Holy waters from Stratholme - not a q reward but always keep all you get since they are great at Nef.
---
You can’t duel wield so no dagger in the off hand and Stormstrike isn’t in the enhance rotation to quote your last comment. Have you played classic?
---
Lol, way to make yourself looks shitty, loser.

"I was going to leave my girlfriend in August, but she already left dumped me after catching me refreshing r/classicwow during lovemaking!"

So Im not from the US. I loved WC3, so the news of WoW hit me hard, I was so exited. Long story short, my pc sucked, internet connection was dial up and didnt have money to pay the monthly fee.  Few years after, I went on a trip to the US and bought this beauty. I could finally pplay this game! Loved every moment of it up to WOTLK. I rememeber the day it launched and the first trip to northrend.  Good times. I hope to live the classic days of WoW I could never see. Cheers
---
I want to be a shaman but I keep getting very mixed advice. How hard is gearing up in classic? More curious about playing as a healing shaman trying to get gear for ele. Am I going to hate playing as a healer if I still want to do a fair bit of stuff on my own? If I was to just can the idea of a shaman am I likely to get a raid spot as a semi casual hunter?
---
Soul link is great for 1v1s and is banned in a lot of duel tournaments.
---
No that's why I'm here thinking about these things
---
Really? I’ve heard raids love resto shamans and people will take up to 8 shamans sometimes
---
It's completely common knowledge, confirmed by blizzard and everyone who played - the new client is heavier and requires better specs. Stop making shit up because you were caught being wrong.
---
DS/Ruin does more dps.
---
Yeah, really. It's why I'm more worried about viability because I've often been denied from even casual dungeons for not being the super optimal top of the line spec
---
Feral tanks have been showcased to work in the pserver scene up to  endgame content so yeah, ferals have had the biggest changes happen to them so far
---
Expectation one looks terrible for some reason to me. Might just not like the art style of huge hands and feet.
---
Didn't even think about addons crashing. The only addon I'm using initially is AllyRoute, because one big problem I had in when I leveled back in 2007 was I didn't know you could do quests in loch modan/wetlands etc. as human, so I literally leveled to 40 just in Elwynn, westfall, redridge, duskwood, and STV grinding half the time. 
---
Do you recommend any other good addons for increasing leveling speed/efficiency?
---
You missed the part where every paladin respecced ret because "muh fun lol"
---
Damn I didn’t notice those circus feet
---
What stacks with weapon enchants? Rogue poisons do, but what about stones and oils?
---
Everyone would... early access and a lot of gold for classic standards... this is the dumbest suggestion in a while
---
You still get new spells and abilities from leveling, just no talents. It just makes the game more challenging which some people enjoy. If it doesn't appeal to you that's cool, just play whatever way you enjoy and have the most fun with.
---
She goes to a different Canadian school; you wouldn't know her.
---
Okay to help you out then. No DW, SS isn’t in the rotation because of rebuff slots and hand of the Edward odd prod rate is low and only useful in pvp. Resto is the only spec shaman excel at
---
That's a pretty big assumption.
---
Clean up your messes as you make them. Push dishes into the dishwasher as you use them. Yada yada. Only real housework that requires any time investment and isn't generally done in a few seconds over many iterations is vacuuming and laundry. So...outta here with that exaggeration.
---
Having 2 cats myself...I have no idea why you felt they were worth mentioning..? Cats require no time? Sit them in your lap or on your desk, wave a toy in their face, and game. Really confusing why they would merit any mention in this discussion of time management.
---
I'll be able to easily game 2-3 hours a night, and not let a single thing slip, including housework, assisting with dinner and some time spent with the children.

World PVP died with battlegrounds, TBC even had 2 world PVP areas but no one really used them
---
Was it ever determined if frontstabbing would work?
---
The fact with those threads is that they are obviously trolls. But i'm pretty sure that some people really want those "advantages" too... 
---
This new generation of gamers is frightening
---
Ah OK I see now. Good job on your weight loss!
---
Time to show the casters some love, everyone seemed interested to see how Melee handled 5man dungeon grinding in Classic, so this time around its an overview and look at how to pull off the same thing with a caster group focused on AoEing large pulls! Hope it helps you get hyped for the leveling coming up in less than 40 days!
---
Is that one useful at all? Doesnt noggen fogger also shrink you down?
---
yeah it did, all you did was stand with the oposite faction queing arena. It made the pvp small group based, it took away big scale fight. worldpvp as you said.  
---
It made the world smaller, when you could just do 2s que 10games a week, and have the same gear as people who did 100+games a day.
---

Nah.

$59.99 for a level 60 boost with pre-bis equipment and full 16-slot bags on character and in-bank.

Since you asked so nicely, my SO was a completely different person when we found out she was pregnant. Time passed, she changed. The context of my life is important, but you have to understand I'm not willing to share every last detail to justify my decisions to some stranger. If you genuinely want to give constructive feedback, try not being incredibly condescending. If you aren't attempting to be constructive, it's probably best to keep your opinions to yourself.
---
two weeks?
---
there was a q&amp;a where someone asked why there are no undead paladins as they are clearly able to use holy magic as priests and there are even lore characters that are forsaken paladins.
---
blizzard answered "we dunt kno lulz"
---
Execute obv
---
Haha
---
I grew up in detroit and learned how to survive.  Will that experience carry over to a wow pvp server?
---
What if youre a rogue youd be able to avoid it right by stealthing?
---
In almost every classic leveling guide, you dont get to select the zones and you cant just start it at level 35. In classic, you jump back and forth between zones picking the quests you want/need/are efficient.
---
I saw 134 and was confused... then you said kg... damn... good on you, still a crazy weight but good on you for losing it and working for it.
---
I used to be 250lb (115ish kg I think), it took me a year to drop to 165lb (75ish). Stupid hard work, but keep it up. You can do it.
---
Brace yourself, incoming down votes, friend
---
For pve? They are fine and you need them. You wont raid without filling the rdruid slots.
---
Love is in the air has really good consumables. 2% hit, 23 spellpower and 10 defense food
---
It doesn't make me uncomfortable, those topics  has nothing to do with the game and should be treated as offtopic and deleted.
---
I think you never used VanillaGuide.
---
That’s what I have heard, and I don’t think I’ll ever get into hardcore raiding. I’ve seen bears tank MC pretty easy and between kids and work and RL I don’t think I’ll be in any hardcore guilds anyway, mostly leveling and bg’s I think. Maybe some pugs down the line. Thanks for everyone’s insight though!
---
Respect my Warcraft pronouns please
---
Paladin tanks are actually completely fine in 5 man dungeons if you know what you are doing and the party don't overaggro too much (although you can temporarily grab aggro back from the top aggro player with Blessing of Protection) and you have to maintain Blessing of Salvation on all party members for the 30% less threat generated. They are much better at AOE tanking in the earlier dungeons than Warriors, and have enough survivability. They just suck in raids
---
Is this a retail addon I can test now or something that is coming for classic?
---
There are a lot of people like me I imagine. On weekdays my only free time is about 8:30pm-11pm and I can’t spend that gaming every night.
---
Because he's been a joke for over a decade. Everything he does is a meme, the IRL boarding thing that didn't work out, the absolutely rigged duel videos, the so-called '1-shot macros' that kill people in like 6-10 globals, not 1.  
---
    
---
He's a one-hit-wonder that has spent over a decade grinding his credibility to dust.
---
You get one permanent enchant and one temporary. All of the things you mentioned there are temporary, so you could have one of them (but not more than one). Most notably, windfury totem is a temporary one -- so you can't have both that and a poison. I think horde rogues leave their mainhand unpoisoned in pve for that reason.
---
This is a BLATANT OVERREACTION.
---
"Need people to fill up our MC raid, need 5 dps, no meme builds" - are you happy?
---
it will not.
---
***&lt;Trouble&gt; [EU-Horde-PvP]*** 
---
We are a community-driven, progression-focused, English-speaking raiding guild. We've been playing online games together for upwards of 15 years, and we've picked up a whole bunch of great players and good friends along the way. We have a wide array of players from all across Europe, and beyond, with varying different levels of experience. 
---
We have players who have reached high heights in both PvE and PvP across various expansions, but also others that have never even played vanilla WoW before. With this in mind, we are creating an inclusive guild where everyone is welcome, as long as they're enthusiastic and willing to play with us to the best of their ability.
---
***Leveling*** - 
---
There will be no rush to level 60. We will begin raids as soon as we have the force to do so, but if it takes you a couple of weeks longer than other people, nobody cares. You will probably be able to join the early birds once you get there. Take your time; enjoy the experience. 
---
***Raiding*** - 
---
We will be raiding two nights a week (all times are in **Server Time (CET)**):
---
**Tuesday/Sunday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
Come Phase 3 (BWL), an additional raid night will be added to revisit older raid tiers:
---
**Wednesday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
All participants are expected to bring their own consumables. You don't have to be doing top tier DPS/HPS, but you do need to respect the rest of the guild enough to bring what you need to be functional in a raid.
---
**Loot System** - 
---
Our loot system will be a very simple, closed bid DKP system with partial decay to help deter hoarding. Name a more iconic duo than loot council and drama.
---
When the third raid day is introduced in Phase 3 (BWL), it is worth noting that it will NOT use the DKP system, and all items will be rolled (main-spec priority, as usual) between raiders who want them. The reason for this is that a lot of people in the guild can only raid two days a week, tops, and they should not feel like they have to come to this raid in order to keep up on DKP for the main tier raids.
---
**Classes** - 
---
Like any other guild, we would prefer the dominant classes with meta specs. However, we do believe that the player comes above the class and spec in a lot of circumstances. If you're dedicated, positive and willing to listen, those things go an exceptionally long way.
---
With that in mind, we are willing to give most people a shot, with the caveat that those classes and specs with a generally weak performance may find it harder to earn a permanent raid spot. If you are very confident in your ability to play an off-meta spec that isn’t listed below to an acceptable level, feel free to contact us:
---
**Druid** - **OPEN (Restoration)** //
---
**Hunter** - **OPEN (Marksmanship)** //
---
**Mage** - **OPEN (Frostbolt spam)** //
---
**Priest** - **OPEN (Holy)** //
---
**Rogue** - **OPEN (Combat/Seal Fate)** //
---
**Shaman** - **OPEN (Restoration)** //
---
**Warlock** - **OPEN (Shadowbolt spam)** //
---
**Warrior** - **OPEN (Fury/Prot)**
---
***Contact*** - 
---
We’d love to answer any questions you may have. The best way to contact us is by joining our Discord:
---
https://discord.gg/Wj2fMHP
---
You can also talk to an officer directly on Discord:
---
**JJ#5133, ianb#7738, Fugger#2372, blart blart blart#4655, Samszee#8393**
---

---
**JJWF#2321, Beanbag#1500, Fugger#2886, Minelaugh#1147, Samszee#2275**
---
Thanks for your time!
---
Not just that, iirc you can't parry or dodge during casting anyways. So unless OP is going to melee a lot, spec 1 is absolutely meaningless.
---
I think they would be more likely to release classic TBC than classic+, with that being said, I thought TBC was trash because the Outlands were a drastic alien escalation from the world of Azeroth.
---
That'll teach me for not reading the subs name... Its a today add on

As to be as PC AS POSSIBLE this the the most silly thing that is beyond sillyness since the history of silly ......since my last post was removed for the word RETARD (even though I myself am on the spectrum) . I hope this expresses just how Absolutely silly this is .....since we all live in a silly bubble of sillyness moderated by silly heads.
---
As far as item research goes, I have a BiS PvE and a BiS PvP set of lists that factor in hit as the variable. Otherwise I can see the headache happening.
---
I would go for the mana conservation in premades. Hands down. Even a 2.5 from a 3 sec cast means a lot in a 1v1, especially with beserking.
---
It will certainly be a variation of the spec linked prior (comments not post)
---
This is such a moronic circlejerk. If they were going to do this, wouldn't they be charging like ANYTHING for the classic release? Instead of the price of a sub? I get it HAHA DAE ATVI IS SO LE GREEDY? and they are, but this is a straight up stupid example. 
---
They're charging - literally - zero dollars for classic, idiot. You don't think they thought about charging for it? I mean, maybe try to think a bit more, i don't know.
---
&gt; healthy bragging rights and respect 
---
so sad.
---
&gt; VanillaGuide
---
Vanillaguide is heavily based on Joana's guide which jumps between zones multiple times and has 1 path.
---
Will there be quests in raventusk hinterlands for us horde?!!?!?
---
Again, as would a ton of people in the modern gaming culture. It is stupid because it is the polar opposite of what WoW classic is bringing back. Effort, grind... it is an objectively stupid suggestion 
---
I say this as someone who enjoys a good mobile game and is used to a bit of cash for a progress boost
---
The man literally said he was gonna respec elemental for pvp at 60. You're just being an asshole and lying about his post with fake quotes.
---
"found my wow CDs heres a pic"
---
You could have literally left out the colon and the joke would have had the same weight without the low-ball poorly executed meme.
---
This guy has your answer. Hop on the Zep and you literally go from one zone to the next. No need to even cross through higher level territory.
---
I am pretty much in the same boat. When I played vanilla back in the days I was 17 and grinded to R14 with my warrior instead of going to school (no regrets tho). These days, I got a son myself (1 1/2 years old), wife, job, etc.
---
Fortunately enough my son goes to bed every day arround 19:30 (my time), so I can play quite freely after that cause my wife is also quite happy if she got some spare time for her hobbies. Due to that I'll be able to play 3-4hours a day consitently 4-6 times a week.
---
Just 3 examples what I take care of when playing classic this time.
---
* Stay away from time expensive class choices (e.g. Warriors / Rogues). In order to compete with other players you need to get R14 or farm epic loot like Ironfoe or Felstriker which is both quite time consuming.
---
* Pick your guild wisely, in classic it can be quite benefitial to join a semi hardcore guild. Classic raiding will not be hard until C'thun+ and a guild that takes raiding seriously will farm through the content in 1-2 raid days until Naxx releases. Also, all players in such a guild will normally get the max out of their class and have consumeables available. Personally I want to spend as little as possible time in raids so I play along with the consumables, try to be a good guild/raid member and focus during the raids in order to keep them short.
---
* Make sure that you guild doesn't make alts mandatory (except you like playing alts and want to invest time on them). Some guilds want to maximize the loot / id and so they "force" their members to have a lvl 60 alt so they can clear MC 2-3 times per id and Ony even 8-10 times.
---
It's great for mitigation for AoE tanking but it has absolutely no AoE threat benefit for warriors whereas all the shields you mentioned do, and threat is the real limiting element in AoE tanking
---
Honestly after I defeated most of the world menaces for 2 years straight in vanilla I think we deserved more from the npcs.
---
We defeated: the elemental lord of fire (he who was ancient when this world was young), both the son an daughter of Deathwing, an old god planning to invade a continent, and the lieutenant on the lich king. Plus a reborn blood god down in stranglethorn vietnam.
---
If the npcs are going to rely on us for everything, they might as well start treating us like heroes.
---
Yes, completely fine and completely annoying. Their "taunt" forces you to stop playing, they have to drink after every pull, and they don't do nearly as much damage.
---
I'll group with a Druid tank any day of the week. I will completely ignore Paladin tanks.
---
Why would you want to play troll priest ?
---
You realize that WoW Classic is going to be full of people that buy gold right?
---
I'm going to start PvP, but reserve the right to reroll PvE if my first server has a lot of the camping players. Killing someone once is fine, corpse camping someone who really has no chance is something else entirely.
---
id pay triple
---
Yeah this thread is people taking really niche things and trying to justify it as min maxing, despite that they insist they're all playing what they want.
---
Or how their wives gave them an ultimatum of WoW or them and they chose WoW.
---
Also, arenas with vanilla class unbalance? LOL
---
I played on a K named p.server about a year ago and leveled up as a paladin. I had no issues forming groups as a prot pala. Ofc there were people that were not cool with it, but you can always find like minded players
---
What do you mean excuse? Maybe people prioritize spending time with their family than playing games all the time?
---
So "free time " goes to them first?

---
&gt;What matters is the synergy between the whole comp
---
It's fairly obvious that a paladin performing a healing role with most talent points invested in holy tree would bring a a better synergy between the whole comp than the one performing tank role with most talent points in protection tree. Nothing changes, really.
---
Shaman with 31 resto points is never "optimal healer". It's a pure hybrid build.
---
That aside, missing Stormstrike is no big deal for melee. It good for burst but takes a big chunk of mana and uses a debuff slot.
---
If you actually only put 31 resto points shaman would do pretty good though. Overall druid is still the best bet.
---
Yeah I honestly can't make sense of the spec start to finish.  
---
The only choice you even realistically have as an elemental shaman is if you go NS, or EM. Even then it's almost certainly NS. I don't know why I respond to "Spec question" threads because 99% of the time it's someone who thinks even though the game has been played for 12+ years they've come up with some new spec that will work, and shocker they never do.
---
You needed to be good instead of needing to nolife
---
&gt; but it would likely come down to player skill in the end.
---
Oh, so Horde wins, got it. ;)
---
It should be great for ninja capping rogue trash. They start to cap flag in arathi basin and you charge and hit them with Mortal Strike or Rend something. Then they can't stealth and are already starting way behind you.
---
I'm not quite sure what you mean? Maybe there is a little misconception, because Alliance quests start at level 40/42 in Hinterlands, but Raventusk quests are at least 45+?
---
You tell 'em, champ.
---
&gt;A druid can't dps like a rogue or mage, but they can battle rez. A pally can't main tank a boss like a warrior, but they can lay-on-hands to save someone.
---
Which is why they're often brought, in the Spec (or build, whatever) that they're good at.
---
If you can bring some utility as a mediocre dps, or do the same as solid healz you know what to do.
---
The role buckets are there for a reason, and hybrid specs are fully understood for what they are.
---
That takes a few seconds some times and the boss will target someone else and get repositioned
---
No, we are all doomed to appear wearing whatever ridiculous hodgepodge of gear we have equipped.  
---
And personally, I’m grateful AF for this.
---
Depends why you play. I play because I need alone time, and not because I like winning or getting good. That alone time I demand with or without kids. But my wife knows it and respect it. She also knew it before we had kids. I told her that I am not a caretaker. I will protect my family from any harm and I will die for them. I will provide for them but I will not be a mother for them. That’s your job. She agreed. 
---
But I don’t play anyway near any unhealthy hours. 1-3 hours each day.
---
&gt; literally zero dollars
---
Um. No? They are charging $15 a month. You might say "it's the same sub as retail". Ok that's true. But if I'm already not paying for retail, subbing to play Classic means I now have to spend an extra $15 a month. It is NOT free.
---
Is it my unknown twin? Would have asked the same question 2 months ago. Now decided to roll rogue. My son will be born around end of august...
---
Totally agree. Demons, shapeshifting, animal pets, totems, stealth. They're all cool. Mages get.. biscuits and portals. They're just a caster without a flavor.
---
Qft
---
You can spec Resto and get a nice raid spot. On top you will be able to solo farm DM East lashers. Win-win.
---
/u/burnt_skeggz
---
If you are using guides and leveling routes and basically just being a robot following a script, you aren’t getting the best experience.
---
I’d be scared tbh, what if a giant roach is on your screen and you thought it be good idea falcon punch it
---
In the dark we tend to go overboard ,with lights on we gently leave the room and return in 1hour or so
---
Every sex toy is a Hunters sex toy.
---
I've never played a game that split roles between damage, heals, and tanking that didnt have this problem. Nobody wants the hard jobs, everyone wants to be a stone cold killer.
---
I agree with you.  But do remember they are still charging the sub and are hoping to get people from classic into the next expansion with some of the changes they are making.
---
Don't pretend it's the goodness of their hearts.  Lots of us haven't given blizz any money in years.  So a boost to their subscribers and great PR are really important for next Xpac and a few new games they have in the works.
---
It was rumoured they dropped below 1mil subscribers for BFA which would be really low numbers for them.  I don't know if that rumor panned out but either way they need to show more subscribers, even if that isn't their main cash cow (shop) it's still important to hold a large interest of mmo gamers.
---
Not those exact dimensions but these [Tirisfal Glade paintings](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aqeot3/finally_finished_all_my_tirisfal_glades_paintings/) are my favorite
---
Just play at work. Am I the only one who brought their gaming rig into their office, along with a 3rd monitor, and spend 5-7 hours a day gaming??
---
”I have a mortgage now” is a a good one too.
---
I would love to see this on youtube.
---
I think you have no fucking idea what I'm talking about.
---
Alliance pvp armor does look pretty good though. Probably the only armor I like in vanilla
---
Yeah, so we called them specs back in vanilla as well. Are you saying we were wrong to do so? Now I need travel back in time and slap myself for using the wrong term. :(
---
Being a main tank is mostly dedication and gear.  If you want to be a gnome MT go for it!
---
I think its going to come to that. I doubt I'll be playing enough for hardcore raiding anyway
---
Most of your SP comes from mainland weaponry. You’re better off getting a good +SP weapon and using firebrand
---
It depends on you social &amp; networking skills. It seems players that are plugged into the server's community always find a decent spot somewhere.
---
Holy magic is to undead what shadow magic is to the living, it's painful for undead priests to use holy magic and requires extreme willpower. In the old lore, it was not uncommon for an undead holy priest to kill them self after being so close to the light for a long time, it made them regain some of their humanity that was lost when they turned undead and they start to fell what it's like to be trapped in a rotten corpse.
---
That is probably part of the reason why you don't see undead paladins, in many ways they are closer to the light than the priest. Imagine using something like avenging wrath, it would probably kill you if your was undead.
---
So thankful to have another man in our marriage life to satisfy The Wife while I'm busy with WoW.
---
What is the difference between items that say, for example, "+40 healing spells" and "increases healing spells and effects by up to 40"? How can I know how much the latter is increasing healing by?
---
Bruhh you got me waekkk😅😅💥👌
---
I don't know if you come to this subreddit, but there is a druid tanking thread every other day.  Druid tanks are viable into MC and for all end game dungeons.  They fit a niche for off tanking and healing.
---
Play whatever class you want.  They are all viable for their roles from 1-60, which takes around 10 days on the low end for new players.
---
I’m not, I’m more just trying to create a view on the level ranges of the zones. So I can take my own decisions on where to go.
---
feral druids were majorly buffed on pservers, thats where the notion of them being viable comes from. in classic that wont be the case.
---
It's worth mentioning that  in early TBC the consumables situation was the same as in vanilla. They eventually fixed it by introducing the system you mentioned.
---
&gt; They're charging - literally - zero dollars for classic
---
Except what we already paid when we bought the base game?
---
You're right. I dont.
---
Ummm
---
Then my elemental shaman comes along and one shot you :) 
---
Still salty that all the healers had no real choice in PvE compared to warriors.
---
Was nice being able to raid as elemental in TBC but with the raid size reduction and how class stacking was still extremely strong it didn't have the impact it would have had in vanilla with 40 man raids.
---
They go insane from being exposed to the void.
---
Link an item and I’ll tell you
---
Have you never experienced a WoW game launch? Even if the servers are up instantly there will be hundreds of people bitching here about *something*.
---
Arenas and the "bring the player, not the class" mindset are what brought homogenization. Believe it or not, I'm pretty sure that each spec can have a distinct role without either being crap or homogenized. As much as I dislike TBC, it did class design pretty damn well compared to Vanilla or Wrath.
---
Really? Maybe the game itself, but include the insane marketing budget of AAA games and I don't think that's true
---
Every subreddit that gains traction gets loads of those kinds of posts and it sucks.
---
Haha I lol'd. You're so right
---
Well that’s cool
---
The reason it says up to 40 is because some spells don't scale 100%. A healing touch will, but a flash of light only gets a fraction.
---
Nice!  I'll be playing Classic on my switch too.
---
I guess you havent heard of PvP, huh ;)
---
Will layering solve resource scarcity at launch or will the starter zones still be overloaded with characters?
---
I can't answer too much specifically about healing shaman but, please remember that if you are raiding as a healer, you will not have any priority on dps gear. That will be considered your off spec and you will only have a chance to get that gear if no one needs it for their main spec in the raid.
---
Been seeing guides running 3 mages, 1 lock and 1 priest. Is this still a thing or not really possible?
---
Lol my girlfriend is playing with me while she streams that's called finding a SO with similar interests.
---
Does anyone have a HQ copy of this to make a poster?
---
Because when someone rolls a human warlock on a pve server their number one priority is pvp and not doing 20% more dps in pve.
---
I feel personally attacked right now.
---
No - best in PvP due to small size and escape artist, and funny as hell if you main tank at 60 just understand the lack of human weapon racials.
---
Don't forget your CHILDREN.
---
TBC was by FAR the best expansion
---
I like Nobbel87 and watched mostly all of his work. But I must say it would be 10 times better if he had correct subtitles on.
---
Usually I like to watch when i eat something...and sometimes his  pronunciation isnt on point and it makes it harder to understand what is he saying.  
---
I wish there were more folks  talking about lore in a different way tho. Just for diversity. Nobbel is the only one covering almost all of it...
---
This place has been cringtopia for a while now, it's all memes, pics of computer setups or pics of old wow discs/physical guides

Gnomes have  [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20593/engineering-specialization](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20593/engineering-specialization) for +15 engineering. Their caps per profession level are 80/165/240/315. Gnomes indeed can have 240 Engineering at lvl 20.
---
However, the deathray also requires Gnomish Engineering specialty. The quest for this is not available until lvl 30:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3643/show-your-work](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3643/show-your-work).

Gnomes can have a deathray at lvl 30, everyone else needs to wait for lvl 35.
---
I don't know why I'm even responding to this ... if someone is posting here on the classicwow subreddit they probably want to play the game?
---
I need 15 bear asses
---
lmfao, is that his newest venture? xD
---
A tip: don't use HD model, and use classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room since it doesn't have an HD model and can only use the classic database for items.
---
Yes
---
&gt; I'm just worried that I lack the self control to police myself
---
 Then don't play.
---
quite common in america, i am right now at my desk.
---
Tristfal glades then silverpine forest are some of the most beautiful areas in the game.

20 days, 4 and a half hours a day, that comes out to 90 hours a month spent playing game. If you spent only half of that time devoted to farming gold to pay for your sub, you get 45 hours of essentially work. Dividing 15 dollars by 45 hours gets us 33 and a third cents per hour as a wage. I don't know how bad you got it over there but I'm pretty sure if you have access to the internet your time is worth more than 34 cents an hour.   
---
For in-game goldfarming to even *approach* parity with just buyin' the gametime with a total crap-paying job, you will have to figure out a way to farm out enough gold to buy a token in less than 3 hours. I have no idea how much those things sell for in-game because I haven't played retail since cata, but I'd reckon they cost much more than 3 hours of effort for most if not nearly all players, otherwise people wouldn't sell them for gold, they'd just farm the gold themselves.
---
Haha, your poor family. :p
---
Yea I won't argue with you there, a lot of things led down that road, I was being a bit hyperbolic. But if we think it through, if the hybrids could be as good as the one trick classes in each spec, why would anyone play the one tricks? IE, if a shaman could tank as well as a warrior, melee dps as well as a warrior or rogue, caster dps as well as a mage, and heal as well as they do, who would play those other classes? Druids would be overpowered as well, so would paladins. Why be a rogue if I can be a rogue/warrior/mage/priest all at once and be just as good? There has to be a give and a take, hence the term "hybrid tax".
---
Ah, genius. I always just hearthed at the end of the night and dumped what I wanted to keep at the bank, sold the junk and logged.
---
This is quality stuff. Look at how many comments you've generated!
---
Can't be foreclosed on if, before release, you sell your house, buy a boat in cash, and park it off shore juuuuust close enough to connect to someone's unsecured wifi. Just make sure you have tons of solar panels and/or a good gas generator.

I love wild and completely unsubstantiated rumors!

His content is great but his accent and way of speaking make it hard to understand. It's honestly frustrating because his content is so good. He also speaks in a strange singsongy tone. Down-vote me but it's a pretty harsh listen.
---
Ah that makes sense. Still get some crazy explosives for the 29 twinks!
---
assume anything that says +x y spells means "up to +x"
---
Thanks for the encouragement!

You're thinking mage vs pally 1v1
---
Now think you and 4 other randoms against a Pally and a Warrior on discord

Difference between sm/ruin and ds/ruin is roughly 5% not 20% and pve server means you don't want unprompted wpvp. Bgs are pretty common on pve servers, too.

Will it run on my late 2011 MacBook Pro? Put in a SSD and maxed out the RAM otherwise it’s stock. Got an error message when trying to fire it up the other day saying I need a better graphics card but also heard that might be a bug that’s getting fixed?

Higher level players see you in stealth

Guys guys, what's the best way to not feel bad for ignoring my kids during classic release???
---
Well, I am my own 'wife' since I'm a single woman playing WoW and I'm totally gonna be posting pics of my fridge content now, when  the time comes. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!!!
---
I specifically remember having a macro with the /train emote in vanilla so I hope they can put it in classic.
---
You been listening to the traitor legions too much
---
No it wouldnt lol
---
What's your Shaman's plan for 12 seconds of Immunity?
---
Druids were always viable as offtank.  
---
Paladins never will be.
---
You still can't craft profession items if you aren't that rank so they still need to be 35 to train the recipe

Her name is Alberta, she lives in Vancouver, my girlfriend who lives in Canada!
---
Fun fact: My Paladin on retail got an abyss shard after the quest on my warlock bugged and a GM sent it to the wrong character. As of about a year ago it still worked and I could take my Paladin Voidwalker into raid xD
---
Also what was the trolls and night elves excuse for not being Paladins?
---
Is there tools/mods that make this easier, or do you need to spreadsheet it and know the game in and out?
---
Down vote all of them and report these posts for not being *directly* related to WoW
---
Hardcore players will do the raids anyway, and as long as they keep adding content like they did with the silithus revamp, dungeon T0.5 sets, 20man raids, extra dungeons etc the casuals are not going to run out of things to do anyway. So not really a good argument.
---
Having exclusive content that only the most hardcore gets to see is good for the game. It keep the world large and mysterious, and it inspires people to strive for something more. I really do believe that having 4 different difficulties for every raid with the exact same gear with different itemlevel really cheapens the experience. Not just for the hardcore players, but the casuals as well.
---
Shit meme
---
Every realm has good guilds, so nog hard
---
Know you'll be basically competing against someone with an additional piece of gear.
---
No, you usually see them. They literally run up to you like a Goomba and hope their Frost Shock sticks because it's their only hope to get close to you so that they can rely on their only hope which is to roll a 5 out of 5.
---
One of the main reasons I'm going Alliance is the laughable number of garbage Shamans wielding Unstoppable Force and spending a year and a half compiling clips for a 3 minute crit montage.
---
Ah, upvote for a man with great taste.
---
If the guild is bringing in outsiders to a raid, then the loot system needs to change. No DKP, no Loot Council, just rolls. It's no different than a pug.
---
Hol up
---
We were apparently on a patch that had no quests in raventusk.
---
"3) You got Classic Vanilla, why can't I get Classic TBC? The logical conclusion to this line of reasoning is Classic BFA, which is the complete opposite to the point of any of this. "
---
No it's not. That's just a guess, it's not the logical conclusion at all. They aren't forced to keep making classic servers all the way up to BFA, merely because they created a TBC one.
---
How about this for guessing: altering classic from authentic opens the door for them to add an in-game store. Right now their number one mantra, as said in the Blizzcon presentation, is to have authenticity as the first priority. But adding new unplayed content throws that out the window. And to fund such an endeavor, they would be inclined to add a store, or tokens.
---
No, I would rather stay on this authentic road, thanks.
---
PvP trinket and tremor. Not many fights have a fear mechanic
---
Spell coefficients are a thing, the math gets a bit screwy but only heal over times, get the flat extra amount.
---
So if my rejuvenation ticks for a *TOTAL* of 100, and I have +40 bonus healing, it would then be 140 healing over its entire duration (not per tick).
---
Cast time spells, get different levels of efficiency from it.
---
The thing is my family isnt that rich, and im still a teen and i cant really work yet, so i'd rather farm the in game gold than buying it with real money, thank u for taking ur time to write this tho, appreciated
---
Gnome Warrior is the best race you can pick on Alliance since they're by far the best in PVP, and who cares about making PVE 0.5% easier?
---
&gt; So if we ignore all the drops from the mobs and go by just kill count; 5 rep per mob, going from Unfriendly(3000), Neutral(3000), Friendly (6000) to Honored for total of 12000 reputation. 2400 mobs at pace of 1 mob every 30 seconds is 20 hours of nonstop grind.
---
RAID GROUPS!!!!
---
Bring a crew of 30, your 30 second kill time goes down to 1! (or likely 5 seconds, with mob availability / respawn)
---
BAM. Done in 3 hours.
---
Sounds like a shit situation to be in. Hope it gets better for you soon
---
&gt; seriously, fuck you and your orgrimmar cookies. 
---
😂🤣😭😂🤣😭😂🤣😭
---
You can take the good from TBC without the bad.  Making a copy of TBC brings all the problems it had.  Why not do better?
---
Check out The Vanilla Drean on YouTube he played all variations of shaman in raids. Ele, enh, a mix between the 2 using hand of rag and spell damage gear etc.
---
Not hard to gear up as a healer, and to get ele gear either A: don't bring any spellcasters with you and stack the group, or B: make friends. (former is easier as melees are quite common)
---
Yea, all those people pointing out they have been banned for buying gold over the last 14 years are lying.
---
Happened to me as a kid in TBC.
---
The only allowed method is the WoW token. Maybe they got more lax after that was added, but I doubt it.
---
Lol scrub reported
---
No they aren't bad at all, people are idiots.
---
RDruids get a few raid spots, which are damn hard to fill. If you play a *GOOD* RDruid, people will worship you.
---
This isn't a wow specific thing, it's just a developer thing. I hear my devs make that joke all the time, for those Slack users there's even a party parrot for "Ship it!" That's almost always used as a joke
---
Gtfo scrub!
---
It obviously led to LFD.  It was half way there.
---
How do 2 Mages deal with Blessing of Sacrifice on the Warrior? Sheep Warrior? Cleanse. Sheep Paladin? Better not hit the Warrior during it.
---
I've run this through my head quite a few times, and I am having a difficult time coming up with a WORSE matchup. The Pally/Warrior could probably beat 2 Mages without a single 10+ second CD.
---
I’d argue the opposite fir everyone besides the super hardcore, we’ll clear MC by the first reset crowd.
---
Why? We’ve been hearing for years just how easy Vanilla was and that 10 good raiders in Blues could do the content.   With consumables, Oomkins and Elemental Shammys can put out high DPS to contribute and provide utility/buffs to other casters.
---
We are also getting 16 debuff slots at launch, that makes things easier.
---
Grossly exaggerated. Even without crowd pummelers, you exceed the threat of warrior. Bears soak up all the trash rogue gear that nobody else wants and turns it into a hulking monster of armor and hp. Maul threat is invaluable, and bears large hp pool allows healers to use slower, more efficient casts even if the bear is taking 15% more damage than a prot warrior. 
---
Warriors do, however, excel over druids when taking many small enemies or a boss with fast attack speeds. Druids also don't work very well tanking like 3 bosses in vanilla, but they can mt almost anything and are valuable off tanks in any raid.
---
I'm definitely going Horde Priest but it would be cool if Starshards had an additional effect. Like when it hit a target it exploded doing additional damage to nearby targets, or a small slow effect, or a play on being blinded by the light where their hit chance is slightly reduced, or as you're suggesting it does Holy damage.
---
I'm definitely in the no changes Cano but I get where you're coming from. It would help them be more viable. If the spell was stronger they still wouldn't compete with Dwarf for a healing spot but it could make them stronger it other niche ways perhaps. Idk
---
Palahoes mad
---
New borns are easy. 
---
Eat, poop, sleep, repeat.
---
Level while sleeping 😉
---
People who think Classic Vanilla is the end-all be-all are wrong too.  The best solution is a new game that adheres to the principles of Vanilla.  You can improve on that formula indefinitely without abandoning the principles.  This is what I'm arguing for.  Going the Classic TBC route would forfeit this possibility.
---
Is that because mage t1 mage gear will have stamina? The PvE bis lists I’ve seen pretty much skip t1 entirely.
---
&gt; You just keep the paladin cc'd and take out the warrior. 
---
I have to assume you never played Vanilla/Pservers here. 
---
Blessing of Sacrifice monkeywrenches your entire theorycraft.
---
Feral doesn’t use dots in raids, and it wouldn’t be much an advantage for them if they could.
---
It's less about inferiority, more about not comprehending putting so much effort and thought into a video game. But then even in real life, I just don't find it fun to be perfectly efficient.
---
I don't hate those who are though.
---
BRE Warrior with heals
---
This right here.  With raids going back to 40-man, most guilds at any level are going to be struggling to find enough competent players to fill slots.  The top raiding guilds can afford to be picky and care what race the priests are.  The tryhard guilds will be picky and wonder why their raids never make.  Everyone else will care about tanks, healers, and putting asses in seats, in that order.  Bonus points if the asses are in their seats on time.
---
You work that much? Damn.
---
What I want is a new game with the original principles of WoW.  If they go the route of Classic TBC they will obviously not do this.  So in practice we cannot both have what we want most likely.
---
nothing wrong with going prot for lvling - [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0zZVGzIczx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0zZVGzIczx) \- with reck the lvling isnt to bad - ret might be still better for lvling - and if your buddy goes shadow u might have a decent synergy(he can heal just fine as shadow in dungeons as well while you can tank 5mans as prot)
---
I’m 4
---
Uhhhh....yes there are
---
Same. Wife, kid, full time job as an engineer. Will be no lifing it. I already consume all my media at my PC, so now i will just be on classic wow while i do it.
---
Something to note: Raid lockouts in vanilla aren't personal. If they raid with another guild thats it for them until MC resets. They cant raid with their own guild until then.
---
You only need classic or a bundle that includes the base game. That doesn't mean it's free though. The new Classic release is basically just Blizzard making old content (that customers have already paid for) available again. Charging money for it would be ridiculous.
---
&gt;not comprehending putting so much effort and thought into a video game.
---
If you cannot comprehend how someone could put some arbitrary amount of effort and thought into a game, how can you comprehend someone putting *any* effort and thought into a game?
---
That would probably be on you to ask if you would get any loot if you are filling in for a guild
---
No idea why they don't have paladins, guess it's because they don't worship the light. 
---
Paladins start as knights not really something that exists in troll society, and trolls are able to become priests because of the power they get from their loas. Night elves are able to become priests because they are close to Elune.
---
Blood elves can be paladin, but the blood knights believe in the holy light so religion seems to play a role in what races can be paladins.
---
Not playing with your wife/husband is the real cringtopia tbh
---
Hunter (any spec), Frost Mage, and Soul Link Warlock are the best PvP classes at every gear level, but Soul Link Warlocks probably get the most out of T1 gear because of their stamina and damage mitigation modifiers. They scale better with gear than any other class.
---
The ToS/EULA was different back then and it won't be reverting for Classic.
---
Frostadamus has a couple YouTube videos on adding for classic, one of them was quest related but I can't remember what it was.
---
Idk if you're serious but even with rested exp leveling multiple characters at the same time when you're mega casual is gonna end up taking a year and a half instead of a year to get one to 60 lol
---
If you get to level 60 in 1-2 weeks. Honestly any guild is going to take you. It shows how much you are willing to invest in playing the game.
---
no, but argent dawn has a trinket. That work in that way
---
HERESY!
---
Thanks for saying that, I appreciate it.
---
I think the thing is that people just read some of the post and comment and don't read every comment in the thread to see that I've said I don't do this in raids or not pull my weight, etc. Which is understandable, you can't expect everyone to read every comment. But it's interesting to see that everyone seems to go to the same place with it and assume the worst. Oh well. I appreciate you saying it though and bringing some positivity.
---
Hey man, leave the soft core porn alone! 😂
---
Plenty of evidence if you analyze the data. It’s no secret that private servers beef up the raid bosses by increasing their HP, armor, damage and making them use their abilities far too often.
---
This sub is already cringe crap dude and it has been for a while.
---
there's no fucking data...  you are talking out of your ass
---
All I need is a bucket of gay. Do they sell it at Walmart, or is it a order online kind of deal?

Which is a compliment for me :) Thank you. However I thought through what you wrote to me and I edited my previous post to get rid of these dots.
---
Thank you:)

This is a common saying in software development that existed quite a long time before their usages of it. Still fun though.

Either but Id reccomend macro-ing

I healed from vanilla - wotlk. This was an unofficial server and I didn’t feel like being a heal bot anymore. I loved it when I was a kid playing because I was a noob and everyone loved me for being a healer but it got boring after 6 years of it.

Respawn is not nearly that quick. With even a few people you can kill faster than the respawn.

Dude if you're worried about reddit's opinion, you really shouldn't be on Reddit.

It's crazy how many people use it as a place to confirm their idiosyncrasies rather than what it is: an anonymous public forum.

Why should I care about 9/10 redditors opinion of me based on one thread? They don't know me lmao and even if they did they aren't a judge, a jury, or God  -- or my mom -- so why the fuck do I care about their opinion ?
---
What value does a stranger's opinion on Reddit hold? How much value *should* it hold? Maybe questions you should ask yourself, as you seem far too caught up in what others think .
---
Gaming subreddits are a cancer, Reddit in general is poison.
---
I wish everyone would go back to using forums and shit at least then decent conversations could happen once in a while.
---
HAVE YOU NO INTEGRITY !!!
---
Because by making Classic TBC it is assumed that they wouldn't make new content beyond that.  What I'm arguing for is that they should make a new game basically, based on Classic Vanilla.  Go in a new direction that doesn't repeat the mistakes of TBC.  Include the good of TBC without the bad.
---
So, with your analogy, it's like enjoying a few candies when you could be enjoying fruit instead which is the much healthier option, and you can only choose one.
---
Usually you don’t want to do that because ones you down a boss you become locked in that specific raid with the people you went with. If that happens you can go raid with your guild until it resets for the week.
---
In what way are they buffed on psevers?
---
i guess not raiding was less boring?
---
 I would hope so since assassination/sub rogue is the best dueler in the game with all cooldowns up. They aren't necessarily the best general purpose PvP class, though.
---
That’s just the way it is man, back when this sub has 10k followers when it was announced we all knew and talked about how once we get closer to release “Reddit” will take over.
---
The 4chan threads on /v/ has much better content than this sub and it’s sad.

I’m already playing on a p server I’d drop 100 bucks to get an early start at this point lol
---
I love comments like this one. I know you're joking, but don't people realize they're not the only ones with limited playtime? Like, do they have to tell everyone?
---
Okay pal, good luck convincing your guild of that.
---
Yeah, I absolutely agree that it would be a bungle and have negative impact. I think we all do! That's why I said it's not particularly valuable to point out. Seems like everyone would agree with you.
---
If you have a good group, Stratholme speed runs are good for cloth, random loot, and similar, with the added bonus of getting Argent Dawn rep through kills and plaguestones, which you will eventually need for a Naxx key.
---
Did this a few times and even with deaths it is fine because of low levels.  I'd go from Duratar and swim across to Ratchet, grab the FP, go to XR, grab the FP, go to camp TJ grab the FP, then quest Mulgore and get back to Org grabbing the FP in TB while questing.
---
iirc (sl) warlocks usually get defensive responsibility in bg since they can handle 1 vs x while still disrupt enemies and protect the flags
---
Thank you

"Rip in piece Mana pool"

lol what?
---
The fun of aiming for an achievement like Loremaster is not so fun when you have to keep a spreadsheet and manually track quest completion.
---
It's just a quality of life thing, having an add-on track it for you
---
Yup, or spinal reaper. 90% of the people in bgs will still be mainly in greens and a few blues. Warrior with a raid weapon will cut through them like hot knife through butter.
---
I failed few times as well. This time it's going well.
---
I know it's hard to start again but, you can do it ! :)
---
nobody:

Deathwing: POGGOP
---
My friend and I ran Michaelascott and Dwightschrute
---
You play in easy mode?
---
Sorry but my old tube monitor with 800 x 600 max is ready for alt tabbing
---
Oh :( I really hoped, they will implement this
---
In a lot of raid content only Warriors are viable tanks. Druids are almost always viable off-tanks, and Paladins &amp; Warlocks (who used to be the best kiters) in some fights, I even believe one fight used a Shadow Priest, but when it comes down to it the only true tanks were Warriors. It was probably a great time to be a good Warrior tank, but I do not need that kind of responsibility either.
---
Who are you to tell me what my favorite game is? Fuck off, I like tbc the most. This is seriously "it's just nostalgia, you don't really like vanilla" all over again. I know what games I like and no amount of reddit posts is going to convince me that I don't like my favorite games.
---
The question is: what (or who) will she be doing during this "break"?
---
There is one for exalted with each BGs Reputation and the Argent Dawn when you reach exalted and one that drops in Scarlet Monasteries Armory.
---
You probably don't want it.  Not assuming OPs job but I have friends who do the same and their jobs are just boring as fuck so the only way they deal is by also gaming.
---
I'll take my career I'm passionate about but can't game.  Go home satisfied and then game over a job like theirs even if i gained 5 hours of play.  Mind numbing work isn't for me.
---
Is fury tanking viable while leveling? I've only seen one source that supports this and my boy atacas shot it down immediately.
---
Biased in what way?
---
The way I see it, there are two potential hurdles that every feral has to face:
---
Firstly, feral druid is actually a very minmaxy spec. If you're not willing to put in significantly more time than other players, your tanking abilities will suffer and your DPS will simply suck.
---
Secondly, guilds typically don't bring more than a single feral to raids. This means that the guild's feral will most often be a senior member with top notch knowledge of specific encounters, gearlists, stat priorities and the game in general.
---
It's rough, but it can work if you're dedicated enough.
---
It’s easier to wait while playing on a p server
---
Two questions (mostly because I can't remember how it was in 2004):
---
1) Bear druids...raidable? I know they can't cap defense, but it's do-able, right?
---
2) ...Cat druids...raidable??
---
Basically me and two buddies are going to be playing together and someone already claimed the healer role but I really want to be a druid so I'm hoping something else is/was viable.
---
&gt; The fun of aiming for an achievement like Loremaster is not so fun when you have to keep a spreadsheet and manually track quest completion.
---
Sure, but that's depending on you inventing an achievement like Loremaster, which you'd have no guarantee an addon would or could do.
---
Damned right.  It's not a sprint to a finish line.  There are 5 more phases to be released after opening day.
---
Some version of loot council with a "wish list" is the best way IMO. DKP hurts the guild. 
---
You have some classes/specs with very little loot competition for most of their gear. They can pool DKP for the big ticket items. And then other classes might spend their DKP on PvP upgrades instead of PvE ones. You're going to see DKP guilds where DFT only goes to Druids while the Warriors spend all of their DKP on 2H weapons that they don't even use in raids. It's dumb.
---
With loot council, you can make sure that Warriors are getting the 2H weapons in addition to raid gear (instead of making them choose one or the other) and the main tank gets the first DFT.
---
Indeed, they get ignored in BGs coz you severely lack damage if you play SL.
---
The "real" BGs spec for warlock is SM/ruin, which requires BWL/AQ+ gear. Plus, you can raid as SM/ruin while you can't (or at least shouldn't) raid as SL. 
---
But I guess SL comes as a decent alternative if you live world pvp and dueling.
---
Nb : I guess you could go in BGs as a deep destrolock (#Drakedog), but you can't raid with it since your fire spells are way too inconvenient and threat heavy in pve. Moreover, it requires a shitton of gear.
---
It's also people already maxing excuses for why they'll be bad. Some people play the game 50+ hours a week and are bad, they need some excuse.
---
Tabards were cosmetic and were their own reward.
---
This is someone even most of this subreddit seems to miss. Vanilla raid mechanics aren't the hardest,no, but there is an insane amount of time that goes into prepping and doing each raid. Naxx isn't the least cleared dungeon in WoW history for lack of trying. I'd wager that 99% of the population will never step into Naxx, let alone clear it.

When Vanilla was out, there was no Youtube, heck there weren't even decent guides on MC until late BWL/AQ40.  Everything about the game is known now, anyone can go look up the Lucifron fight on Youtube and read a super efficient, easy strat on how to do it.  All it will take is \_some\_ people in a raid group to have seen the guides to tell all the people in crystal clear Discord how to do it.  Mechanics wise, MC is very simple, and I would hazard to guess that using one or two meme-specs won't cause a wipe.  
---
Also, we're using 1.12 specs which are much better than specs at release and through 1.4.  I think that decent players, not private server players, who do a tiny bit of research will easily be able to kill all the way up to Domo with little issue.  Watching that fight on Youtube makes it orders of magnitude easier to understand than reading a guide that may not have even used.a decent strat.
---
I'm sorry that you got diabetic :( I hope you manage to keep it at bay. My friend has same problem and he need to test from blood before and after every meal to take propper dose in shots. Crazy. Buy the bright side is after 3 years he got used to it. Now he has a wife, 3 kids, and is building a house. 
---
I know you can have different situation but keep the faith that one day it will be fine. Manageable. Work hard and you have my best wishes!! :)
---
Prior to that you had to run through BRD, but you could do so as a full raid. It was 1.3 that also limited the dungeons at 10 players.
---
&gt; Players who have completed the Molten Core discovery quest can now port directly to the zone, bypassing Blackrock Depths.
---
God the no-effort horrible paint memes get way too many upvotes.  They wouldn't of been considered good in  2005 can we have some quality standards 14 years later...
---
You guys just don’t do it like the girls that’s where you have gone wrong. I bought a new computer this week, set up my vacation time, and told my husband I expect my meals to be brought to me!  Don’t forget your chores. So sad for you guys. Poor men.  Poor training on your part or bad selection process, maybe.
---
The end goal is not to play Classic Vanilla forever.  The end goal is to make new game content that doesn't go down the same path as the past.  The end goal is to make a new game entirely that as the same MMORPG principles as the original game, but with better improvements and new expansions.
---
No u
---
They aren't that good in bgs which seems to be what most people are talking about here. Also they do need gear, and it's hard to imagine them getting much raid gear during T1.
---
Before we had "increased knowledge" early on in wow, we didn't know how powerful warrior dps was. Everyone thought they were average. I think that's what he means. Maybe there's a method or gear we don't know or understand which makes a meme spec strong.
---
If you’re all talking together then you’re playing with them.
---
&gt;Never actually played for the alliance much, but your reply gives me some food for thoughts. Assuming my friend will pick a warrior i might roll a pally and play alliance...
---
Ich hatte genau die selbe als Jugendlicher an der Wand xD PcGames ftw
---
Troll is obvious!
---
Always male characters. I like to see a masculine avatar.
---
ret + shadow or ret + disc I guess
---
So the main point about classes having a whole toolkit and how they bring more to an encounter than just a single thing like dps or healing went right past you and you focused on on the terminology in the first paragraph... but you read it. Sure. Kiss my ass.
---
Nah, it'll be like those posts about X and X played WoW together and got married! Everybody upvote!
---
Then the mods come in and say "rules are discretionary" and leave it up.
---
I don't know how I feel about your tower UNDER your desk. You spill something and it drips inside you're gonna be in trouble. I know this because I spilled tea and it dripped liquid honey all over my GPU... Rubbing Alcohol + Qtips saved the card but it was sketchy.
---
While you may have up to 240 engineering, you are overlooking a critical requirement.
---
In order to learn gnomish death ray you must be level 35 to learn gnomish engineering which includes the death ray itself.  Its a BoP trinket that you must build yourself making the gnome engineering racial irrelevant in this case.
---
I got a nice little paragraph typed to me because my response to "need that?" was let me run a sim and I'll know, apparently I'm a try hard who needs to get a life
---
I have a wife, house, pets and good job.  I don't want to see my girlfriend made me x posts either.  So don't assume op is even single.  Lots of us hate those garbage posts.  Save it for instagram
---
1. Yes as ot
---
2. You have to farm a lot to be doable and hc guilds are likely to refuse you but if you are really into it maybe.
---
For some being one of the first 60s of your class no matter the way is a good experience
---
The question was, would we see more non-meta specs.  I think in MC/BWL you will see a lot more than what were traditional accepted back in the day, and that's because so few were accepted back in the day.  
---
Druid tank is a great example, they really, really sucked early in Vanilla, but they are just fine in 1.12 (fear mechanic fights aside).  But in Vanilla, 1.12 was the end of the cycle and it was much too late for Druids who wanted to tank to get geared up, so beyond PUG-ing MC and BWL, they were kind of sccewed.  
---
Let's also not forget that 16 debuff slots versus 8 will make more specs viable
---
Paladins arnt meant to tank in vanilla, that would give them a huge unfair advantage over horde since alliance would have an extra tank class.
---
So I don't get why people say "pallys are bad tanks", they were never meant to tank so yeah that's a given.
---
Its like saying "shamans are bad tanks" or "rogues" are bad tanks"... Duh.
---
Mining and engineering is a solid plan.
---
That racial give all axes to gnomes/elves/dwarfs
---
"New content = in-game store" is way more of a leap than "Classic TBC = Classic BFA".  If they do Classic TBC they are obviously 100% guaranteed going to do Classic Wrath.  If they do Classic Wrath how sure are you they won't do Classic Cata?
---
One thing is for certain: if they do Classic TBC they definitely won't add any new content with old MMORPG philosophies.
---
But early raids are pretty easy.  Plus a knowledgable Feral Druid who farms Manual Crowd Pummllers will probably do a lot more damage than a random "meta" DPS class who doesn't pay attention.
---
Also, when has DPS even been the main problem on a fight before Patchwerk in Naxx?
---
Organized BGs, no, but neither are SL warlocks in that case. And you'd be including Druid since they're essential in every premade. In MC gear vs MC gear Shadow Priests in random off-spec pieces still destroy every melee class and most of the casters.
---
Vanilla had a focus frame addon, it will definitely be remade for classic.
---
 Cool
---
I like it the other way.  DKP but with rules against bad decisions such as rolling on offrole over main raid role or first X goes to main tank for set dkp then next is up for bids etc.
---
I had good exp with DKP with officer oversight and we rarely had to step in because if you were trying to game the system you'd be booted for being a douchebag anyways.
---
The people working at blizz can't make new wow classic content they made bfa???
---
Lmao thank fuck I’m not the only one who thinks all of those are bullshit
---
Rogue stood out to me and I have no idea why but I felt like rogue related to me personally. In any game I played when I was younger I would always roll a rogue. I played by myself and had no friends to play wow with so rogue was just a good fit for a solo player who loved pvp. Now with friends and a love a healing, paladin calls to me.
---
Correct, R14 is just weapons, AQ40ish weapons, slightly above BWL for sure
---
There's also some stuff about their abilities sharing DR and people being able to just run over their traps with spellbatching
---
Hear, hear. 
---
Also, is it really that much of a burden to swipe past something you dont like with your heckin finger? 
---
The shit people complain about...
---
There are a few people left in the world who can make the choice to not follow others like lemmings.
---
Sure. If you want to debate any hypothetical scenario then literally anything is possible. Seems kind of pointless though.
---
Let's stick to reality. Currently there's a very clear definition of the tanks' potential. Warrior-&gt;Druid---------------------&gt;Pala.
---
My favorites are when people post their absolutely awful WoW tattoos. How anyone can have a tattoo like that and not be embarrassed is a mystery to me.
---
Maybe you should do it and earn some serious bucks on YT?
---
Just found the post on it. Yikes. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I agree.  That's why I want you to agree with me so they have no choice but to make the best game possible because the community demands it.
---
&gt; a random "meta" DPS class who doesn't pay attention.
---
Crushed quite a few meta DPS who were trying. There was gold on the line so they were trying. (Feral druid)
---
But the problem is, skill floor for the spec is much higher than a normal DPS, so it's much more reliable to go with a dps warrior, over a cat.
---
From what I've gathered, it's one of the reasons you are recommended to see a doctor any time you plan to lose weight. Many other reasons are the too. If you can, see a dietitian too
---
Try to find any strategic resources on this subreddit and you'll be met with threads telling people to "just relax and enjoy the game"
---
Its naive to think nothing would change, the power level was already too high on naxx gear. The point of classic is to have a true vanilla experiencie new lvl 60 content is not that.
---
And its not like they can just unmake changes, if the fuck up, only way to try to fix them it would be to make even more changes, too much of a risk i rather we have vanilla intact and people that like other xpacs better get that.
---
Every player chooses what their experience will be. Existence of a million and one guides here will not impact a player who does not read them
---
It's not bullshit.  First enemy maybe slightly exaggerating but plenty of people died over the years fighting the Defias bandits in Northshire or the Feldogs in Valley of Trials.  In comparison the the Diablo nukefest of WoW today, Vanilla was a challenge.
---
only you know if you'll find value in the work
---
Unpopular opinion: Teachers make the world less enjoyable for kids
---
Correct, but if subreddits didn't have rules all sorts of random garbage would get to the frontpage. Subreddits are moderated because what the masses upvote isn't necessarily what creates a good subreddit.
---
Thank you for making a post about this. I refuse negativity in real life but sometimes the bubbly karma bullshit on Reddit just brings me to shitpost
---
I am a casual player by heart, but always end up in (semi) hardcore guilds.   I prefer those for exactly that reason:  usually less drama.   The way I  get in is being honest.  I can show them that I know how to play  and I can pull my weight, but for a limited amount of time.   I will be one of the members that is less active, just doing the minimum  that is required for my spot.   I accept that I won't get the best gear first.  (but since hardcore guilds are so efficient , I still get plenty of  gear, usually a lot more than I would get in a casual guild)
---
Maybe try adding a rest day(wow day) in your routine..skip the gym midweek so your muscles can rebuild and you can level your char, win win!
---
No, my wife's boyfriend.
---
&gt; Hear, hear.
---
Starting your reply with this is cringy as fuck, just saying.
---
Depends on wether you want AoE leveling or not. If you pick AoE, do not take the freezing talent and spec 2 points into improving blizzard (never 3, you don't want blizzard's chill to be higher than CoC's.
---
Keeping in mind that AoE leveling will probably not be possible at launch, I'd pick the freezing and shatter talents (and thus the higher crit damage one) to be more effective at single target damage and PvP. The order of the talents I can't tell you since I sort of wing it. But I start with imp Frostbolt, take the improved chill and chance to freeze ones, CS when available, and then imp nova as the last points to make shatter available, and then take that.
---
You should thin your paint when you apply it to miniatures man! Just wet the brush in water a little before using colours or mix a bit in, will make a difference in detail.
---
You sound like a bitch, just sayin
---
Better even when you think of it like this.
---
This is a sub for a game, a creation that is meant to provide enjoyment, fun, and excitement among other things.
---
...so let’s ask to remove things that show peoples excitement, increase peoples enjoyment, and what some people consider fun. (Also, creativity in some cases, even if it’s not some persons taste)
---
I’m one for discussions, that’s why I use reddit. Not for the other things.  But when you want to remove (or censor, what have you) the content to conform to “only serious post!” ...that’s how many games die. That’s why a lot of the classic community isn’t liked and hasn’t flourished. If you want classic to succeed and flourish, that attitude needs to be snipped. 
---
I get it, some of us thrive for efficiency, and ideally that would mean these post don’t exist, I get that.  But at the end of the day, take a breathe. Remember we’re ALL here to have fun, and login and play something, don’t make a hateful post.
---
Nice. That's where I played then. Undead Warlock named Keldraga lol. I forgot my guild name, I want to say it was Sublime.
---
I feel like the majority of Classic's player base will be in between their late 20s and 30s. I feel like it will be thr 17-20ish Y/O saying "Hello my fellow adults" instead.
---
Shadow priests used to have a spell called 'surrender to madness' that was a huge damage boost, with the downside that it would kill the player when it ended and the player was unable to be combat ressed.
---
I think it's a shame they changed it, lore-wise it was one of the coolest abilities in the game showed so perfectly was it means to be a shadow priest.
---
I agree, the game feels so spoiled with all the non stop class guides and dungeon guides. Instead of discovery the game has turned in to an auto pilot let down.
---
Shamans can wear mail after level 40
---
I never got that one. But our raid leader that also was main tank got it. I remember it was fun helping him with the final quests to make it into the strongest version. He was sooo happy and thrilled.
---
No BGs in P1 and P2... But same applies in wPvP to a certain extent.
---
He somehow fucked that you twice, maybe even thrice
---
Don't you just hate your significant other, am I right?????
---
I remember Sublime. I was Elemental Shaman Zulbak in &lt;Red is Dead&gt;
---

---
What say you of this mans petition my lord?
---
The wife and I are at a bit of a disagreement about me playing this game. We comprised so I’m gonna let her visit her my buddy Sindarius on the weekends so I can have wow all to myself! Sindarius was the one that convinced me to do this! It’s actually a great deal. I have some alone time and they have some as well!
---
Kind of defeats the purpose of DKP though, right? Sounds like loot council with extra steps + more inefficiencies. You're still going to see things like Priests bidding on non-set cloth healing gear, when that gear should go to Paladins instead.
---
A BIT OF WINE NOW AND AGAIN, A GIRL SQUEALING IN BED, THE FEEL OF A HORSE BETWEEN MY LEGS?
---
I figured occasionally you need to pop out of shadow form and lay down some heals, if you have a melee on your ass the 70% pushback resist chance would be decent
---
How do they be proof of location? Can you mail to a specifically located mailbox?
---
almost nobody will follow those guides to the letter.  (Only people who   deliberately chose to do that, for whatever reason)    The majority of players will just play on their own, using guides only for those bits where they get stuck or need some pointers.
---
disgusting midgets
---
Thanks for wording my feelings.
---
High five. I share your opinion 100%
---
tl;dr 
---
We all know and agree retail sucks and classic wow was the best.
---
My exact quote is "few pvp consumables" and you're saying that I said that fap is the only thing that's farmed in low level zones. Why did you deliberately twist what I said?
---
If you think that nobody was in the world in tbc then I don't know what to tell you, that's not true at all. Places like daily areas and farming zones like elemental plateau were hotspots for pvp. Ground mounts were 40% faster than flying mounts unless you were rich enough to buy the fast ones, which most people were not.
---
Immersion and coolness is my only drive to play. It will probably take some time to get to max level but that’s Oki.
---
My wife currently says she will not play Classic WoW.  She also swore in blood that she would never play WoW back in Vanilla.  Then I came home one night and she was a WoW crackhead.  Remember the scene in the South Park WoW Episode where Cartman has him mom bring the shit-bucket down to the basement so he could keep playing?  That was my wife until the end of WotLK.
---
Dungeons are super easy. We are going 4 mages 1 tank as we did in beta. Just pull everything and aoe. 1 week to 60
---
I was interested in you guys' argument since both of you had good reasoning but you lost me with this one.
---
Oh look, u/underthingy said something trollish and stupid. I can hardly believe it.
---
Feel better, little buddy!
---
Why does time mostly only feel like it flys when you’re getting old? Do old people release more energy according to your theory?
---
I had a friend who was a high end tank druid back in vanilla.  The class drew people who wanted to be able to do everything too. They were just more rare.
---
My arguments are not loosely strung together streams of consciousness.  These are arguments that opponents of modern WoW have been making, eloquently, for many years.  I am arguing to adhere to the old school MMORPG principles of the original game.  Classic TBC was a good game, but it began to slowly abandon those principles.  We should not abandon those principles.  We should demand new content that adheres to them, while adding in some of the things from TBC that improved the game **without the bad**.
---
I bet it was cool to swing around. I remember it looked so huge!
---
Fine with me, send me back to 2004, I've got a whole lot of stuff I need to do over.
---
Not this guy again. Please no more shit posting.
---
Reddit is cringe though, so expecting something different even in /r/classicwow seems to be a waste.  
---
Can we start by banning the "Why I am coming back posts"?

Yeah...that's not really a good analogy in this case. Sure, you do you, go make your own bad build cause you think it's good, but if people literally calculated the optimal specs, why play anything else?
---
I'd love it if the internet was "forbidden" from talking about wow. If everyone had to figure it out for themselves. But that's not the case, and "not following others" just leaves you at a disadvantage.

Yes autocorrect got the best of me

You sound like my buddies wife lol

Nah ill take classic TBC, thanks. You can stop speaking for more than just yourself at any point in time, though.

What don't you like about Skarm? The guy seems informative, good facts and not bullshit factoids, he could use some practice in speaking but I assume that will improve.

Classic+ doesn't exist yet so you don't know that.
---
Everyone should have the freedom of speech on Reddit without any limitation. The majority will decide how visible that speech is.

If enough people agree that /r/classicwow should only be about XYZ, then a picture of a cat would never reach the top. Therefore, if it does reach the top, then it is relevant to a majority of the users on /r/classicwow.

Oh the comment calling this dude out for his negativity? Sorry, forgot reddit was a safe space, fuck you snowflake
---
Be careful to not miss your level 10 quests which might only he available in your starting zone.
---
"its"
---
Figured as much, but wasn’t sure if Concentration was a pally talent I’d forgotten about haha
---
Especially if retail does somehow impossibly die, where do you think all the lfr-ers and the titangforging lovers will go? They will come to classic and take over as majority player base again.
---
Yes it’s German. As far as I can remember, most of the names where English. In 2006 they localized a lot of names like Ironforge to Eisenschmiede. 
---
Here’s a list of localized names https://www.buffed.de/World-of-Warcraft-Spiel-42971/News/Burning-Crusade-Uebersetzungs-Dampfwalze-fuer-Hauptstadt-Namen-790371/

I prefer for a subreddit to be a benevolent dictatorship.  The masses are dumb give me a mod who knows how to gas low effort karmafarm posts.
---

---
\-Level in the area where you want rep, regardless of where your character starts. If I recall correctly, lower level quests (grey) don't give rep. So go to Darnassus, Darkshore, Ashenvale etc.
---
\-Hand in cloth when you're out of quests. It takes a bunch of runecloth, but it's doable with some time and/or gold. Don't expect to get a cross-faction mount at level 40 - you need exalted.
---
\-You can get a Wintersaber mount from Winterspring, but that grind is much worse than the Darnassus rep grind.
---
\-You can get a rank 11 PVP nightsaber, which is also much worse than the Darnassus rep grind.
---
\-You can luck out on the Zulian Tiger from ZG, but that's far in the future!
---
This is a big brain take, I bet the clouds feel nice brushing past your towering cranium.
---
An un-biased LC system is impossible.  
---
The best example is to think of a news channel that is trying to be unbiased. You could take every story and tell the facts. But there are unlimited amount of stories and only a set amount of hours to tell them. The person that decides what stories go on is an Editor/Producer and they make the call on what stories go on and what stories get cut. At some point there is going to be a bias one way or another.  
---
Point is, no one is perfect and no one is totally un-biased. The system is prime for corruption and favoritism on the bad side and if ran close to perfectly people are going to be pissed they didn't get the gear. The system might work for like the top .1% of guilds but for the VAST majority it is a guild breaker.
---
How many times can they Consecrate before going oom?

So when can I start posting Jared Taylor videos on this subreddit?
---
Even job can be partially evaded. I'm content to work part time and live somewhere cheap that I share with other people.
---
Danke!
---
Like are these even real people? Or is it just made up bullshit for karma whoring?
---
This is a legitimate concern.
---
No.  BFA wasn't inevitable.  Lots of design choices,  poor community awareness / vocal minorities, and other mistakes led us there.
---
Just like Classic wasn't inevitable.  Support of private servers, large following, and vocal public figures got us here.
---
We need to be part of the conversation and not let vocal minorities lead us back to BFA.
---
I’ve mained feral druid since 2006 and back then, I wasn’t allowed to tank and rarely got to dps. “lol druids are healers”, I was told over and over. So I had to throw on cloth gear and heal in feral spec. I just accepted it cos I was new. I’m really looking forward to playing my druid how I want to in Classic, and not feel like I’m a joke spec no one in their right mind would choose.
---
In Vanilla a mob (and I assume a player) could only have 8 debuffs on them at a time.  Any new debuff would push something that was there off.  I do think there was some sort of prioritization for things like Sunder Armor, but there wasn't for other debuffs.    
---
Why this is a big deal is because some classes couldn't use abilities because it'd use a debuff slot and risk pushing something off my valuable.  For example, pre 1.7, the Barman's Shanker was one of the better daggers in the game even though it was a level 50 blue, because it had a 2.0 attack speed.  Unfortunately, at a very low proc rate it'd put on a 30 second poison debuff which could potentially push off something much more important, like a Warlock Curse which was buffing 6 mages.  THat's definitely not worth it.  
---
At the start of classic it'll be 16 debuff slots, which suddenly mean that those slots aren't \_as\_ important as they used to be.  Now, you definitely don't want the Shanker debuff (it sucks), but now you can other debuffs that can possibly make a non-meta meme spec more valuable.
---
Fcking teachers teaching us things so we don't even have to find out things by ourselves.. Ruining all the fun
---
No idea who that is, but unfortunately this subreddit is not governed by its people and instead policed by a bunch of incompetent green aliens, so probably never.
---
Is your lip quivering as you write this? Jesus.
---
By your logic, classic is the start of a long line of success that ultimately ended in BFA, therefor we shouldn't do classic. Why are you arguing so hard against something like classic TBC? Makes literally no sense to me. As much a concrete example of "I DECIDE WHAT IS FUN" as I have ever seen.
---
I think you may be contradicting yourself here a little bit.  TBC pushed players to reach end game content faster than Vanilla did.  This is one of the philosophies that changed over the years to the point where now in modern WoW it's all about reaching max level.  TBC started this simply with the level cap increase and focus on content that was 60+.
---
Which was confirmed to be vanilla like and the pservers got it wrong
---
Gnome hitbox isn't smaller, but they fit through choke points others wouldn't. (e.g. alliance fireplaces)
---
Mostly because there is no unanimous consensus on what it means for this game to die. Many people think of it as hitting an arbitrary low-population point where it doesn't feel populated to them anymore.
---
And that is also assuming that when the last expansion is released and progressed through to the end, that's assuming that blizzard plans to release more classic reboots between now and then.
---
Also the whole idea of them and us is kind of silly, they are us and we are them. We want classic but our investment in our characters in classic will cause us to keep playing those characters Beyond classic. How far beyond will vary from person to person
---
PvP trinket, tremor and the bs trinket will be good enough.
---
You could start at Classic Vanilla and go in a different direction, though.  By going to Classic TBC you are saying you don't want to go in a different direction.  People who prefer the old school MMORPG principles of the original game should be allergic to the idea of going down the same path again.
---
Is this all frost tree BTW or do you delve into arcane/fire at all for those early talents that seem so worthwhile like arcane subtlety? 
---
I'm used to playing a warrior all my life and we dip into other trees for nearly every build we use from leveling to end game raiding..
---
Ladies and gentleman: the state of our education system.
---
I grinded my shadow priest to field marshal they are exceptional in battlegrounds.
---
Sounds like a jest more than salt. 
---
I called plenty of people in school over achievers for turning in homework or studying for tests. It wasnt salt,  just me acknowledging my laziness.
---
&gt; I said I was talking about MODERN WOW (BFA) at the start of my post.   
---
&gt; What I argued is TBC started us down a path towards modern WoW 
---
Right, but thats not a valid reason to say that TBC-Classic shouldn't be made, or that it's a worse option than Classic+. Nobody here will defend BFA, so if thats the only discussion we can address, it's kind of a moot point putting it in this sub. You can see in my post that I understand what you mean, about how it "started us down the modern path". But thats why most people don't want the modern game, they want BC. It doesn't matter that summon stones led to LFR, if LFR isn't in the game. You can have a problem with summon stones, and that would be entirely valid, but LFR shouldn't even be in the conversation. *It doesn't matter* that LFR eventually happened if its not in BC. ?
---
exactly. combine it with terrible management/lack of promotion and...rip to a beautiful game. :/
---
The tl;dr is actually:
---
The MMORPG principles of Vanilla should be adhered to with new content going forward.  Make new and better content that doesn't abandon those principles.
---
I know I'm a little late, but how would your gear change from each of those roles? Do you NEED to have a strength tank set for tanking 5 mans? Would stat priority change at all for PvP versus PvE? Ways to increase burst in PvP? Thanks.
---
could quibble with some info but this is the kind of content we need, not the millionth private server based ‘leveling guide’
---
There's no game to buy, you just need a subscription for the region you want to play in. Regardless of region, you can set the locale of your client to DE and play in German.
---
I agree actually.  I'm just saying TBC made a lot of mistakes and we could have a better game than any xpac that currently exists.
---
It's a very unique concept. Anything that makes old content still viable is good in my books. However I still would rather keep the game in the original world. The more expansion lands there are the more diluted the game becomes. Perhaps just add a new section to Easter Plaguelands where Arthas has instead decided to return to.
---
Bruh, this is reddit. No matter what sub you are on, no matter how niche it is, the things that get upvoted are going to be unfunny garbage that appeal to, for a lack of a better word, normies. Just ignore it.
---
pve server haha
---
Amazing. Thank you! I have never played WOW.
---
The thing is, back then people didn't know any better. Today everyone knows. Ask 100 random Classic players whether Moonkin or Mage is best for raiding. Or Ret vs Fury. Most people know the answer. That means is becomes a very conscious decision when you carry meme specs.
---
If you are wiping, and you have meme specs in crucial roles like tanks, everyone in the raid has to make a conscious decision: "Am I OK with us wiping a bit on this boss, because Jerry wants to MT on a Paladin?"
---
I'm maining a Paladin this time around as well, and I am planning to grind rep for the tiger at 60. It'll be slower, but since my main used to be a Nelf warrior, it'll probably bring back some fond memories as well. I'm planning to reach level 4 in Northshire, visit the Paladin trainer, get gathering professions in Stormwind, and then venture on the wetlands run to Nelf starting area. I was considering doing the Mountain skip route, however the full run is an adventure in itself IMO. And you'll get abit exploration xp along the way. Once you reach Teldrassil your still low enough level to get rep from the beginner quests there. I wish you good fortune!
---
I used to occasionally raid with another guild if my guild had something on farm / weren’t planning on running it. Particularly used to run a lot of ZG this way. I had a really good relationship with that guild in general. But I would usually work it out by like telling them I’m only interested in a specific piece of loot so if it drops I want a fair chance to roll on it. But everything else they can use their typical loot mechanics. Occasionally I’d come along in exchange for a free expensive enchant or something.
---
Yeah, is the lowest level of buyin just the current xpac? Or is there a $20 starter that includes every xpac up to legion or something ?
---
If they don't add new content it will just stop there because people will eventually stop playing.
---
People who enjoyed Vanilla are often wondering what the new MMORPG will be to capture the enjoyment of Vanilla.  Well, what if that new MMORPG is just new content made by blizzard that is the opposite of Modern WoW?
---
Honestly, if you come from retail the content is super easy.
---
The easiest retail raid boss will shit on naxxramas mechanics wise.
---
No problem.
---
Are you playing from Europe or somewhere else? If you're playing from Europe, it's super easy to get the game into German. If you're playing somewhere else, it's a bit more complicated.
---
All the guides are not really accurate anyway
---
I don't see why people couldn't just freely post here whatever they like about the classic wow.
---
Got a new painting? Cool for you. I'll upvote of it's a cool painting. Happy that you're playing with your GF once again? That's fine and I appreciate that someone likes to share personal stuff like that because you know what, hearing about stuff like that might make someone else happy.
---
Upvote the posts you like. Downvote what you don't. Stop making up a petty rules about what people should and should not post.
---
Yeah, this casual argument is moronic.
---
Dream for a better world!
---
Great, thanks!
---
In California, United States at first, then Germany later
---
Still waiting for official realm confirmation. The last word was that nothing was planned for RP-PVP as of yet. So all we can do is hope they add just 1 server of that type.
---
Oh I dont mean to suggest every druid player was bad, the best wow pvper i knew irl played druid, it was just an uncommon class with a ton of class fantasy, and that fantasy sometimes clouded judgement. In bc I was in a dungeon spam group, and after a certain point I realized that the tank, a bear, was multiboxing as the healer, a resto druid. I dont doubt that guy's skill, either.
---
Love how people keep saying the only the top guilds can clear naxx and at the same time it should be a requirement to get to the next content.
---
So this is news to me, I can't find anything that suggests blocking causes threat in Classic\Vanilla.  
---
And because you're reducing damage taken, you generate less rage.
---
Things to consider.
---
Impressive editing skills!
---
rx560 and 1050ti are similar priced? Then the 1050ti would be better. Check out some benchmark vids on youtube. People get good results with a few year old i5. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfpnPZ4RgeI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfpnPZ4RgeI)
---
You'd have to use Legion/BFA as a reference because classic will be using a legion graphics client.
---
Honestly, I wonder what you could do with 6 healers with scarab brooches and a paladin tank.
---
Unless I am mistaken they didn't outright say there wouldn't be, they said that nothing was planned for RP-PVP, but there has been a lot of demand for it, so fingers crossed.
---
30 points is deep feral.
---
After listening to the classic devs talk on various podcasts, books, streams... It seems like this was the answer for why they did most of the content they created. It's amazing because the game turned out so great. It seems like everything was thoroughly planned. I mean you would agree that the available class/race combinations totally make sense right?
---
They said WoW Classic would have PVP, PVE, and RP realms at launch. When asked about RP-PVP they said they have no plans/intentions for it at launch but are open to discussing it after launch.
---
My girlfriend/wife made this mundane thing with a video game logo on it! 20k upvotes
---
Has the hunter pet-command input lag been fixed? I can't find anyone talking about it anymore. I don't want to play a hunter or lock it the issue hasn't been addressed.
---
Heck, it still is, I love trying to break out of new instances, though they've gotten A LOT BETTER
---
That's exactly the kind of low effort meme that's deleted by the numbers every day.
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot is king.
---
- If you're in that guild's run, chances are your guild isn't running that raid
---
- If you're in that guild's run, chances are they need more players.
---
Do a good job, and congrats, you have a new guild to raid with.
---
All a Druid needs to heal as feral is HotW and some tier gear. You don’t need 2 tanks for every fight, so the Druid can heal when not needed as a tank. As for your last point, there’s hardly any feral gear in MC/BWL, and you can just make them low priority on healer gear.
---
I've tried to stay out of this hype for the most part but is there a place to go to buy WoW classic online, like the site? Or do I re-up my account I haven't used in two years?
---
While I agree with you, Human warrior is probably the only min/max class choice which makes so much of a difference that it's a no brainer.
---
Gnome vs Human mage etc. is such an insignificant difference that it doesn't matter, but for Warrior that weapon skill is HUGE in PvE, easily the most overpowered racial in the history of the game.
---
And it shouldn't be. If the community deems it low effort, then it will get buried. We've already seen that the moderators are entirely subjective in their opinions on what passes their tests.
---
Only certain spots in Ramparts could be jumped out of, eventually they all got fixed, invisible walls prevent you from jumping off
---
Unless i'm mistaken, did Ramparts have no invisible walls when it first launched? It definitely had some in Wrath at least, wasn't until MoP that all the walls got completely fixed, though its still easy to escape and explore out of bounds
---
yes, no one wants to be forced to do 6 tiers of obsolete content just to get to the current expansion.
---
Ahhh!! It wasn't the loading screen it was the Arathi Basin map!

---
Revantusk horde quests get added late in vanilla, not sure about the patch. I would also like to know, if anyone has played the beta. It was one of the better quest hubs for horde in that range, and it also gives you your first (combat) trinket.
---
It *can* be a jest. It is just as often not.
---
How sure are you that you will enjoy classic?
---
You’re going to find you’ll burn out easy if you don’t lighten up and treat classic wow as the one big giant meme that it was.
---
I’ve tried the 2/3 improved blizzard and 3/3 improved blizzard for aoe grinding and I gotta say, there is a noticeable improvement with 3/3. I know the guides all day otherwise but that was my experience
---
Several bosses into Naxx in Vanilla were also cleared by guilds that didn't force raiders to use consume, and also that had a few meme specs here and there. Several Vanilla vets have said that already.
---
The main problem there is for minmaxers and elitist, is that they want to speedrun content for some reason, and that clearing a raid in 1h instead of 2h is way more important that to have a friendly group to play with.
---
Then they tell every new Classic redditers suboptimal = shit. Then more and more people become assholes speedrunners for no reason.
---
If a post is popular, it means some portion of the sub enjoys it. If it’s unpopular but you’re seeing it anyways, well that’s what comes from sorting by new/viewing every post.
---
My girl left me permanently so I can focus on classic! 😁
---
Yea we will everyone will be here praising, or shitting on blizzard for how shit, or "authentic" the launch experience is because of the queue times and the down times 🤣🤣
---
Lmao
---
I believe blizzard confirmed that if classic is a success, they will do TBC and WotLK.
---
I like how everyone, including Blizzard apparently, has forgotten that Sylvanas is basically a disgusting fucking corpse that is animated through magic.
---
No, the problem is that this sub is an echo chamber of retarded. I've already unsubbed
---
I'm curious what expansion you started playing.
---
I think Tuji's point is that in the long run, warlocks and pretty viable in pve and pvp, firestone or not because firestone's just isn't an essential spell, but the race specific abilities that priests get in vanilla is quite crucial and as I recall when I played vanilla, I don't think I've ever seen an NE priest.
---
oh no
---
it's retarded
---
My liege bobby b being here makes my day brighter
---
IT MUST WOUND YOUR PRIDE! STANDING OUT THERE, LIKE A GLORIFIED SENTRY!
---
While OP didn't provide a well-written, constructive post, at least he's bringing about some discussion on a valid topic. Additionally, mods are going to take one guy PMing them way less seriously than a post with potentially hundreds or thousands of upvotes.
---
I pretty much agree with him and wish this sub pertained to the game itself and not its players and their life stories, but I'm ready to accept the fact that I'm probably in the minority here. At least having a way to filter posts via tags would be great, though.
---
Likely this place is full of people who have been on the internet for decades and remember a time when it wasn't absolutely flooded with normie garbage.
---
Nope the problem is your writing sucks. The reader has to make a lot of logical concessions to try to get into you, the authors, mindset to rationalize what the point of your post actually is. What make it’s worse is when people respond as a result of your bad writing you become a whiny bitch and lash out at them.
---
Prot pally in 5 mans is more than fine, and I would even say is awesome. Stop spreading misinformation. I'm just mad when I read such things although I did clear 50+ dungeons as a pala tank in Vanilla. Always making friends because of it and that the groups were efficient AND chill.
---
Agility and Stamina.
---
Has Blizzard ever said if they will keep the original vanilla class balancing the entire time or will they ever be fixing the balance?
---
according to wowhead there is a post that claims it procs ravager but even if true i don't know how effective it is, i remember this enchant bring pretty useless in actual vanilla.
---
Badass, ty
---
This thread is about druids. Only hunters can get that weapon.
---
YES. i have been bellowing like an insane person to anyone who will listen that the combined 15 years’ worth of knowledge we’ve amassed about how to push the game to the absolute limit represent such a seismic influence on how everything plays out that in effect it will remake classic into an entirely different game. i suspect a huge # of old truisms we’ve come to think of as established facts only got to be 
---
that way because people still repeat them — and that the “competition” @ the top end — how advanced your macros/addons/ game sense/skill will need to be, etc — is going to be much harder than people think
---
I agree that people playing for their first time will get more out of the game if they just play it naturally, pausing to look up a few things when they get stuck but mostly going with the flow.
---
No...free market would be a GDKP pug. DKP is socialism.
---
Mining should be the big money maker, both short and long term. The amount of people that think they are pvp gods and abso-fucking-lutely need engi + another crafting proffesion for BOP gear is too damn high.  
---
But it could be me taking Reddit seriously...
---
if your goal is to aoe farm instances as a paladin i suggest looking into:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12628/demon-forged-breastplate
---
it scales with spellpower
---
I'd steal from disc tree, armor is minor and manaregen is for pve
---
Don't know why people are so afraid of a "remastered" classic wow as apposed to the bare bones original. We all know what retail wow lacks and we are bringing classic wow to get back all the social mechanics and difficulty that vanilla offers which is great, but there is nothing wrong with adding minor details to make it more balanced.
---
I mean we could go a step further and just play WC3 aswell
---
If old content makes money and/or converts lost players to retail, they will repeat the relatively low cost customer acquisition.
---
There are no firm plans for anything beyond classic as of yet.
---
Add politics to this list please. Although trade chat can't seem to stay off the subject, we don't need it here too!
---
I wholeheartedly agree but eh. Art is pretty sick though. Vidya games in general are 60% art 40% content. So is a book we read.
---
The hosts each have copies of the letter to trade with contests.
---
3v3 triple warrior team
---
Depends what you consider hard. Getting 40 idiots together to take down a raid is hard in and of itself. LOL
---
No cool shamanstuff? :(
---
**MT.** A guild's Main Tank will get Thunderfury, some quicker than others.
---
For OT I'd go Orc for the skill hands down. I'm my guilds 2nd in line Tank and I'm going Orc.
---
dungeon leveling or dungeon cleave as we like to call it, is a lot different what you might expect.
---
first and foremost you need a full premade group. just /2 lfg xx wont help you and just slow you down.
---
3 warriors + shaman + priest is probably the best group due to wf totem and the actual cleave ability
---
you won't run full Dungeons, you run in cycles of 12min and reset and farm the trash again till you consider jumping of a bridge and testing rl fall damage.
---
you can join us at https://discord.gg/3CZvN7d to get more infos.
---
recent testing of this level method up to 50 indicate a much faster /played as anything else. we estimate roughly at about 3,5days played
---
And those both share DR with wyvern sting...
---
Maths, 2,3k signed , only 10% actually sigb these things, so 23k interested on it, 80% leave after first month that makes 4,6k players actually interested, talking about statistics.
---
It's normal for dps to be overpopulated, it's even somewhat healthy. Generally, you need x3 more dps than tanks/healers for a 5 man and for a 40man raid. If you've tried to get a tanking spot as a new recruit, it's really hard, as serious guilds require serious tanks and those spots are usually taken way early in the guild's creation cycle.
---
That said, you do you, play what you like &amp; feel useful as. My clothie, life tapping ass thanks you :)
---
No, I like having a full set and most times bis is not matching. I still love vanilla models
---
I mean it’s not like people where straight up stupid back then. People knew paladins sucked as tanks and as a result I rarely ever saw them.
---
&gt; You think FAP's are the only thing that are farmed?
---
This is an exact sentence you posted. I never said that at all but for some reason you decided to say that I did. Why?
---
If you're using 'cringe' or 'cringey' as a serious criticism, you can fuck off. I bet you call things 'autistic' and liberally say 'literally' a lot.
---
They are keeping it as is at least until the end of the phases(so something like 2 years). After that anything is possible and it depends on how things look then.
---
Fwiw, i also think the vanilla class/spec balance is a bit of a joke.
---

---
I mean... I do generally agree but some of this is a touch overstated. I’m gonna be really impressed when I see casual chill guilds clearing that abomination of a design 4 horsemen encounter.
---
The community here freaks out whenever someone posts their opinions on small changes to classic no matter what it is. Unfortunately, i don't think blizzard will buff NE priests, but I wouldn't mind if they did because i doubt it will alter the game mechanics or social aspects that we all enjoy from vanilla.
---
Get help
---
Hmm, well you have a decision to make.
---
Your subscription and account are only valid in one region. Whatever characters you create, whatever progress you make, none of it can be transferred over.
---
You choice is:
---
1. Create an EU account, add a subscription to it, and play on an EU realm from California until you move.
---
2. Create a US account, add a subscription to it, and play on a US realm after you move to Germany.
---
I don't know how long you'll be in California, but if you're moving before 2020, I would choose option #1. WoW is very much a team game, especially once you reach level 60. You'll want your peak hours to be the same as the majority and you won't get that if you're playing on a server in a different region.
---
Max &amp; Paddy.
---
There is really no wrong choice here.
---
1) study the classes, pick the one you like.
---
2) consider utility, food is nice, but so are summons.
---
Also the ones we trim away because they didn't provide enough valuable contribution.
---
Just incase [**Druids Why Be Wizard When You Dan Be Bear Shirt**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://avengs.com/druids-why-be-wizard-when-you-dan-be-bear&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1563834657752000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3dvc7LgTqrDj4m-S5NAKoDi8Psw)
---
It ramped up when the release date was announced. The sub count skyrocketed with ppl who didnt even care to he here until the game was right around the corner.
---
Or i could just have a fury warrior tank probably better and dps far better, and a moonglow/NG druid heal (mainly) or dps.
---
And just be all around superior.
---
*hey guys I got the horde symbol (poorly) tattoo’d on my entire fat pale arm*

I don't want TBC because I don't want to see the Horde once again become filled with flouncy fucking elves that were only created as a lure for Alliance weenies.
---
just dont use them lol
---
More than enough since fights in 5 mans are considerably shorter than raid fights.
---
Amazing guidance thank you. I will be moving in the summer of year 2020. I think I‘ll choose option 1, and play in the mornings for now, so it‘s evenings in Europe.
---
You forgot shaman... :P
---
You don't see them much on this sub. Back in vanilla there was a certain amount of animosity towards minmaxers with spreadsheets from some players who thought they were "spoiling the game", who also tended to stereotype minmaxers as toxic or divisive elitists.
---
"Elitism" was a low bar on my failserver where pugs routinely failed on ZG bosses and only a few guilds could reliably field a team to clear UBRS.
---
If you're planning to level cooking &amp; fishing, you're doing yourself a disservice by not doing them in tandem. There are some gaps as far as I remember, but you could level cooking pretty comfortably by leveling fishing. Just my 2 cents.
---
If you're generalizing me as a serious argument, you can fuck off. I bet you get mad about posts and liberally voice your anger a lot.
---
You should probably lvl feral even if in group, you'll heal just fine even in feral.
---
For a third i'd go mage as well, water and food + mage portal will be very handy on your quest to 60.
---
It's ok I'm a limo driver.
---
Mage for water and teleport

"My wife's boyfriend knows how excited I've been to play Classic, so he took her on a week-long trip so that I could play in peace!  And they left me some snacks! I have the best wife!!"
---
In truth, I am not too sure. I am older now and I don't have the same amount of time to dedicate to learning how to play a class and whatnot. For me, WoW is the game I always reach for when I'm just looking to have some mindless relaxation time. I kind of enjoy the relative easiness of retail for that reason. 
---
That being said, I'm excited for Classic and looking forward to giving it a shot. I hope I can find the time to really dive into it.
---
Keep telling yourself that
---
Well if we are going for #nochanges then they will fall over in the first 5 minutes. :P
---
That's good to know.
---
I'll be ranking up cooking when I can during leveling and then try to get any buff recipes for raiding asap
---
Fishing will be more of a leisure thing, maybe during phase 2.
---
Bfa was smooth for most and for others (Stormrage) their main server was down for an entire day...
---
It's going to be hit or miss but I expect that the majority of players will be able to start their journey within 1-2 hours of launch.
---
It's the staged posts, and softcore porn commissions.
---
&gt;But seriously, send me game time! I have 3 kids and my wife wont let me spend money on wow.
---
You go to work, yes? So it's your money you earned. You don't need permission to use it on something you want. Why are you acting like your wife is your mom and your money is allowance.
---
Only 100$ for a head start, I would gladly pay 200$ for a head start.
---
Fully agree, I'll be playing in a group of 5. We're all from the same country, but aligning our schedules might still be a little problematic.
---
Exactly this. Or put another way, you think you won't be tired of it, but you will be.
---
Not sure what Dark is but I'll raise you Stranger Things season 3
---
I'm playing on a TBC server right now and if I see a 2H enhance shaman coming at me I fuckin run for my life
---
In theory that is possible, but I think in reality once you make Classic TBC you've already pre-ordained that Classic Wraith will be made as well.
---
On top of that, even though all the good of TBC outweighed the bad, TBC still had a lot of bad.  Vanilla had a lot of bad, too.  Classic+ is the concept that you keep adding "good" to the game while taking out the "bad", as defined by the original principles of the game (ie. maintaining class identity is "good" while making the classes more similar to each other is "bad").
---
Classic Vanilla is obviously what we're getting for now so that's our starting point.  You're saying delay new content until after "1 more expansion".  If we really want new content to happen, it needs to start happening ASAP, otherwise it might not happen at all.
---
Awesome!
---
'member when this subreddit was all theory crafting and serious discussion over mechanics and playstyle with a sprinkle of humor?
---
Casual opinions. 🤢
---
Yeah that part baffled me. Guy needs permission from his wife to spend his own money? Lmao
---
Most of the guides are designed to funnel players away from the prime locations. I've already seen many guides that will lead players into less efficient / enjoyable scenarios. Remember, your competition is everyone else, so if everyone takes the "efficient" route, then no one ends up being efficient.
---
Soul link is really good in small scale pvp. Affliction is good for multidotting. Destro is also good for seducing someone then deleting them with a soul fire/shadowburn. 
---
Lock have multiple viable pvp styles, which is rare in vanilla.
---
It's very fun to level. I have a fond memory of getting ganked by a rogue in Bloodfang Hood in tanaris as lvl ~40-45, and kitting him till he died :D I never played on it after hitting lvl 60 though... Not sure why, but I think I changed server and faction.
---
Man you butchered that!
---
But I am still laughing.. you get my vote. :D
---
No worries, it's not exactly the same, people will achieve burn out and stop playing at an earlier point in the next 15 year cycle than they did in the last 15 years cycle.
---
Idk why but this just seems really ridiculous in how you’re sort of making vanilla players out for baboons. People knew how to do math back then and had basic logical skills. Everyone including people who couldn’t even get into a bottom tier guild knew that Ret and moonkin where meme specs and knew that mage is obviously better then moonkin ect. 
---
You’re not wrong overall. I’m just disagreeing with your argument about how these specs where seen in vanilla because people didn’t know better. People absolutely knew better. If we did see these specs in vanilla it’s because someone was BFF’s with the guild leadership and successfully begged them to let them toy with a meme build for a while / give them leftover gear no one wants.
---
Hey Reddit I cleaned my desk and put a WoW poster on the wall, upvote my battle station! August 27 will literally be the greatest day in history and the anniversary of Classic's launch will be celebrated by our descendants thousands of years in the future throughout the galaxy!
---
The shitty memes on this subreddit are more cringe than those posts
---
I'm making an argument in favor of making a better game than has existed before, by taking what we learned from the past.
---
If people who desperately want to play TBC again want to misinterpret this as "you don't want me to have fun", then that's just silly.
---
I think they meant Martin Fury, a shirt that a guild used to 1 shot several hard mode fights in Ulduar while WotLK was live.
---
Their post is actually leading to some appropriate discussion. Unlike some other comments.
---
I am torn on this. I actually really hope young people (12-20) decide to pick up the game. I think if they give it a real chance the game will pull them in. Which would be a double edged sword. On one side there are more people playing proving how much people enjoy the old style of the game and how engaging it is/was. On the other side young people are a little quicker to be toxic.
---
\*side note: i have found a lot of supposed grown men who immediately act like children so maybe the younger people will actually be a little more polite since they won't know what they are doing.
---
Shitting on TBC is not an argument in favor of Classic+, unless in your mind only 1 can ever exist. At this point you are just shitposting.
---
doesn't leeway only affect you while you are moving, you have to be standing still to auto-shot
---
I've got kids on top of all that. The trick is to neglect them, both physically and emotionally. Emotionally just so you remain consistent
---
You realize Orcs are aliens right?
---
“Here look what I found cleaning up my basement”.
---
Iirc, the PVP and RP servers always had added drama for the GMs to deal with. 
---
RPVP servers had even more, by far the most GM tickets submitted. This might lead Blizzard to be hesitant to cause themselves more trouble than they absolutely have to.
---
I played Hunter originally to High Warlord, and Hunter on the beta, and it felt near identical to me.
---
People got excited by an announcement intended to get people excited and gather awareness.  Amazing how that works.
---
Idk if I would call 1 piece of gear from MC per month progress.
---
When you're young you've been alive for less time so each moment, in the context of your life, feels like it's worth more. 
---
When you have 80 years under your belt one month isn't much time, but to a 10 year old one month can mean a lot.
---
It wouldn't be doing the same over again, though.  It would be doing different things and getting different results, which is what I'm advocating for.  It would be easy to *not* do flying mounts, daily quests, level cap increases.
---
Really great book, was really hard to put down - but I must admit, I would have loved if there was just a little be more content from
---
After the game released. It kind of just ends and would love some
---
Behind the scenes of the chaotic launch and how they all reacted to how insanely popular the game came to be.
---
I imagine this part is actually going to be more true in Classic. While we all know a few stand-outs among the non-DPS in PvP from vanilla (Holy/Prot Paladin especially), for the most part alot of the things Blizzard did to try to force healers and tanks into being more PvP viable didn't come until after vanilla: AoE heals were basically non-existant, the "mark the tank with some uber-powerful protection" abilities of various sorts every healer seems to have now were non-existant, and unlike now where the difference is much closer, tanking speccs then did garbage damage.  The same is true for the difference in leveling, it was almost impossible to level in a tank/healer spec so it was harder to learn your spec as you go, thus also encouraging more DPS. So I think my question was a bit counter-intuitive, because it is overall just going to get worse.
---
I'm just a backwater dirtfarmer from the middle of nowhere and I can confirm this works. I seen two chickens fkin two days in a row and I could swear I went back in time.
---
I don't really keep track of what day it is, so you just gonna have to trust my gut on this one.
---
I have absolutely no intention on playing on this type of server but i really hope they do it. There are a section of people who really want this. Plus, whats one more server? If no one is on it, tell the players and put them all on a regular rp server.
---
my only issue with your point is that it literally can be used for classic, "don't do classic, take the good things from it and improve bfa"
---
like the other user suggested, vanilla started some of the issues that eventually led to what we see today, should we scrap classic? no, because ultimately people want to play *that* game, not its philosophies
---
Warriors, unless being beaten on and thus having (near) infinte rage, produce nowhere near as much threat as a feral. Maul has completely ridiculous threat scaling.
---
Also, how on Earth would a Moonglow druid DPS? Balance spells are pitiful.
---
Cleaning up to make space for that sweet karma.
---
I was shitting on that douche
---
I want an addon to help me quest, but I don't want any help questing.  
---
Quite a strange request
---
TBC was pretty much spot on in that regard.  Had to clear the content in order and there were still fresh T4 guilds starting up even at the end of the expansion. 
---
Very much hoping they progress to TBC after Vanilla.  I’ll take it exactly as it was any day, but if they wanted to figure out a way to removing flying, dailies, and badges I’d be even happier.
---
I 'member
---
Young people follow the hype trains. If it stays near the top of twitch then it will draw them in.
---
No mention of T1 warlock? Good luck getting through that HP in MC gear.
---
Yeah, reddit definitely has a higher percentage of the hardcore min-maxers than will be representative of the actual playing population.
---
I don’t believe mods have good tools to make this happen on mobile :(. And mobile is a very common these days. Chances are the majority of page views come from a mobile client in this subreddit.
---
I said I liked TBC. I also said Vanilla had it's problems too.  My assumption is that Blizzard won't do Classic+ if they do Classic TBC instead.  This is not an unreasonable assumption.  None of this is shitposting, only your comment was.
---
Odd. On pservers it's very popular. Every caster wants the wand and staff, melee have leather or mail gloves, or the shield q reward.
---
It wouldnt be easy. TBC was made with flying in mind its pretty much designed around it. They would have to alter everything. So we are better to just make Classic+. I also dont care for flying.
---
Two groups of 2 and joining up for instances might be more effective.
---
Amen. 
---
And then they can launch a fresh batch of vanilla servers and do it all again as the original batch moves to level 85.
---
"Heeeeeyloh ev-eryone. Today, I wanted to talk to you about FROSTMOUUURNE, andhowitcorruptedtheverysoulofournobleprince, Arthas. BUT FIRST! We must delve, alittledeeper, into what led such an innocent prince on this path... of destruction."
---
I'm with the guy above. Love Nobbel's research and presentation but his speech pattern puts me right off.
---
ITT: Nothing is real and nothing ever happens. Everyone is a scam artist for imaginary internet points.
---
A good healer will kick u and finish the dungeon without a tank or with a new one. XD
---
Blizzard's gotten really good at it. I wasn't there for BFA launch (and I could not find any comments about issues), but I was for Legion's and there wasn't even a server restart. One minute the content wasn't available and the next minute it was. Not a single disconnect that entire week.
---
I played Classic, everyone is complaining hardcore about leeway and shared DR on our CCs, but it all looks pretty normal to me.
---
Pet behaviour was a bit weird/buggy but according to Blizzard they've addressed a lot of issues. As for guys charging/sprint over traps? That shit was around in Vanilla, annoying yes, but part of the game.
---
Even if not being able to post what you want in a subreddit had anything to do with freedom of speech, which it does not, you still have the opportunity to post whatever content you want on other subreddits. Complaining about not being able to post unrelated content on a specific subreddit affecting your freedom of speech, is like complaining about not being able to discuss history in math class. Which of course would not be a violation of your freedom of speech.
---
I don't understand the assumption people keep making that "Classic+ means broken classes forever".  Yes, Vanilla had a balance issue.  Yes, it should be improved.  No, it doesn't mean TBC is the only solution possible.
---
There's the possibility to fix the flaws in the classes, I had posted in the 4 day chat about the future, and I had put that in, have a set, or a relic/ranged slot item for each class that provides some kind of alternate ability for these classes which "fixes" some of the drawbacks and brings classes more in line.
---
Yes talents in TBC do a TON of work to fix the issues, but doesn't mean the "meme" spec players wouldn't get a bit better, to bridge a bit of the gap. It's just a lot of time and effort blizzard would have to go through.
---
Time will tell.
---
Have you forgotten what brought on this argument? There is no unrelated content, just content the OP thinks isn't good enough quality.
---
For a hardcore guild maybe, for 99.9% of people playing, that won't be the case. 
---
The whole point is not knowing everyone's level of skill and that everyone's skill level will be different. Sure you can say you're only going to recruit dwarf priests but that dwarf priest could play poorly. And you can say that about any race but that is exactly the point, bigger factors come into play than just someone's race.
---
With the best gear in the game you'll have like ~320 int. So yeah, 8-10 int while progressing seems right.
---
Warlocks have more health though, so they might both get hit for the same amount, but they can take more hits.
---
I personally agree but Naxx seems this line people have, so ill meet people part way. Besides, if a raid has a HotW/NS player from MC through BWL they’ll know their value and not question if for AQ and Naxx...I’m being sneaky 😉
---
I am 100% going to play a Shaman on classic, level as Enh and then probably play resto because we have a core group of at least 5-10 people (more than likely 5) so we can get all of our pre-raid BiS. I think that 3 of us (we are close friends) are going to all choose Tauren: Shaman, Hunter, and Druid. I really want to play Orc but i also really want to play with my buddies. So i really can't decide which Race to be. 
---
Maybe we will just plan to meet up after level 10 or so and level together. Except our class specific quest will be in way different places (if i recall correctly)
---
Any way i love Shamans and there is a good chance i will level 1 Enh and then after saving gear and gold im going to bite the bullet and level either as strictly Ele or Strictly Resto just for fun (or punishment) lol
---
Ah, my mistake
---
Reddit didn’t exist during classic and I’m going for the truest experience tyvm.
---
I think it's much more likely that if/when Blizzard announces TBC Classic, they also announce that one Vanilla-only realm per continent will be made available for anyone wishing to take a one way transfer to it and be completely forgotten about. If you want to play Vanilla, you roll there. All other realms will get pushed to the next expansion.
---
Put on your kid’s favorite show/movies and have him/her sit next to you and “hang out” while you play and they watch what they like. Maybe share some snacks together, make each other laugh etc
---
Let me quote you:
---
&gt;If a picture of a cat would reach the top of this subreddit, then a picture of a cat should be at the top of this subreddit.
---
fuck off
---
This is actually a great idea.  I’ve been thinking they just force everybody to TBC, but something like this could work.
---
I got a second monitor just so I can shitpost AND play at the same time.
---
I personally think a Shaman in every group would be perfect HAHA. I am super biased and stupid because i love Shamans more than any other class.
---
Gnome+noggenfogger shrink = almost impossible to click on
---
Don't you know, everyone on here is going for world firsts. This is why true champions use diapers. Last time I used a Gatorade bottle and lost 20 seconds pissing into it.
---
I'm planning on playing a feral druid in classic, either 14/32/5 for better DPS or 0/30/21 for better healing, depending on what the guild needs. I kinda really like the idea of flexing into roles, though I'll market myself as an off-tank first and foremost.
---
how about if people upvote things, it means they like them and we should have content that people have proven to like
---
Besides, not like edgemasters handguards don't exist lol.
---
That's just your opinion. Stating your opinion like it's 100% guaranteed is silly.
---
That was not my example, I was just playing along. And I later clarified why that picture of a cat would be related to Classic WoW.
---
Ya broken racials are dumb. Weapon skill is a big culprit. So is fear ward. . . You KNOW screw fear ward.
---
Fear ward is only for 3 bosses. After your dwarf is worse than a human for AQ and beyond.
---
Will of the Forsaken is big time overrated. Yeah its an extra fear escape, but We're not talking TBC arenas we're talking about group play. 10v10, 15v15, and 40v40. Its over hyped to hell, and your dueling an undead in Wpvp then you should of brought a friend. World PVP is no rules, bring your buddies.
---
Unless you pvp. Escape artist is godly for warrior pvp.
---
Yeah, it’s not like you ever need to read or do math or think critically or anything.
---
Talents like shadow weaving have a diminishing return. Look at the first point, you go from 0% chance of applying the effect to 20%. That's an infinite increase in effectiveness, well spent talent point. The second point takes you from 20% to 40%, you just doubled the number of shadow weaving procs. Point 3 goes from 40% to 60%, only a 50% improvement. So now you see why the last point is the least useful.
---
Most nostalgic two towers chapter for me for some reason
---
That's why I wanted to try RP-PvP this time. They just seem... cooler. Seems like there may not be one in Classic though so I'm gonna be on the lookout for whatever PvP server might be deemed as unofficial RP-PvP.
---
I doubt they ever will because "spec balance" isn't a thing in Vanilla. You are your class, not your spec.
---
TBC &amp; beyond made each spec kind of a standalone class.
---
:,)
---
I read and followed some guides on vanilla wow on launch.
---
Learning a bunch of information about the game never ruined it for me.  It enhanced it.
---
I’m out of the loop can someone explain the post for me please? I would really appreciate it cause I feel kind of dumb lol
---
I feel personally attacked. 
---
I usually cook at home and my partner is looking up recipes to make so i have more time to play.
---
That's not smart, thats being a bad healer. Our job is to finish the dungeon as fast and save as possible. If the tank is pulling too slow then he sux.
---
I never cared about the dps taking dmg. If he dies I did not heal hard enough. If I don't want to have a challenge, then I go and play some candycrush. Healing in Classic is easy.. Just manage your mana well, use the 5s rule and get some.
---
I thought maybe it could all Lv. 1s to prevent that.
---
I think we should ban people who use the word cringe. How about that one?
---
Wives u mean peoples "pillows" leaving snacks and notes
---
pally tank for 5 mans, the only thing they are good for
---
Words are pretty impactful on how people think about things.
---
The issue comes in all the server types you have.
---
English EU PVP + English EU PVE + English EU RP + German PVP + German PVE + German RP + French PVP + French PVE + French RP would all have to transfer to one realm. Do you make it PVP or PVE?
---
Similarly, all the US regions would have to merge.
---
You might get away with having one PVP and one PVE realm per continent, but there might also not be enough players to sustain them both.
---
The fact that I really want to play a night elf hunter named legless is the reason why picking a class/race combo is so hard. 
---
Min/max v nostalgia :’(
---
Of the two main tanks (guild-leading, hardcore minmaxers) I've raided with on alliance pservers, one was gnome. Other dwarf. Both had tfury. 
---
Weapon skill is important for dps warriors, it is negligible for tanks. Half of a dps war's damage is straight white hits, the rest requires rage generated by those hits. 
---
Almost none of a tank's threat comes from white hits, and most of their rage comes from GETTING hit.
---
Blizzard is not giving us Classic WoW out of the goodness of their heart. Someone in a board room has decided this is a good way to increase profit.
---
If they want to continue making money they already have an expansion ready to go that will require thousands of hours less work to ship than some Classic+ dream.
---
Dont forget blizzard exists to make money and they will always take the path of less time more money when looking at this type of thing.
---
TBC is going to happen. Classic+ is not.
---
I think the point he was making is that the mentality from retail that’s has given the word “spec” it’s current meaning had attached to the word “spec” itself
---
True champion just [upgrade their office chairs](https://www.amazon.com/Personal-Mobility-Waterproof-Accessible-Transport/dp/B07DJ25MHT/).
---
I’d say as group i would probably go mage just because they give more group utilities that last like food/water and teleport, whereas lock gives the party health stones/soulstones and summons, which are cool but in my mind just more of a pain while group leveling because you can only carry one and will have to keep mad soul stones to keep making them. Also they don’t heal a lot so will only be more for oh shit moments which don’t occur quite as much while group questing. Both definitely have their advantages and bring a lot to the table so it’s a lot more what you want to play than anything. Lock I feel like does a lot better solo leveling than mage but for group I feel like mage is slightly better option if you’re worried about efficiency and getting the most out of your toon.
---
So you do agree that a subreddit must have some degree of moderation, and not let the content be decided solely by votes?
---
The backpeddle is unreal when the title of THIS post is "Effort Post Against Classic TBC"
---
Are you serious? LMAO
---
&gt;hitting an arbitrary low-population point where it doesn't feel populated to them anymore
---
funny that you use those exact words. because by god retail feels empty. i dont really want to shit on bfa too much but i played for about a month when bfa released (like i always do, who doesnt hope things improve), and there were max 20 people in the new city/ your shard at any given time and the most people i have ever seen were like 40 when you quickjoin a worldboss group.  
---
i never described wow as dead since the community is still very much alive. but by your definition it 100% ***seems*** dead.
---
Snowflake doesn’t mean someone who thinks they’re special. It’s someone who thinks they’re special and is also sensitive, in the way that a snowflake is delicate and fragile.
---
Don't do drugs, kids. And if you do, don't do too much.
---
+5 swords matters very little to tanks.
---
Really well said. I wish I could upvote you multiple times but that'd be vote manipulation lol.
---
I guess the question is how many people will care about the meta, or care about tanking a 40 man. If we were to judge by reading this subreddit, it seems half are obsessed with meta class, meta spec, speed leveling. The other half day they are just going to take it easy and play what they want. So I guess we will see both out there.
---
With arcane intellect on, at t2 the difference seems to be [27 int](https://imgur.com/a/Jiwl9).
---
You can only theorycraft and shit on meme specs for so long before it gets old. I expect nothing of quality from this sub until August 27th.
---
Yea, its actually a worthwhile dungeon, we just didn't know or care back then. Once people got into the habit of not running it, that habit ingrained itself.
---
Eh fuck it, just respond as "yes I do need it" every time, regardless. Saves hassle.
---
no
---
&gt; The majority of us seem to agree Warriors, Rogues, and Mages will be the top 3 classes populated. 
---
Not if you look at the data. Archived census data from Vanilla, census data from several Private Servers, census data from the Beta, census data from the Stress Tests, and most importantly, every major Classic survey has the populations like this:
---
Horde:
---
1. Warrior (18%)
---
2. Shaman (15%)
---
3. Warlock (14%)
---
4. Mage (13%)
---
5. Priest (12%)
---
6. Rogue (12%)
---
7. Hunter (8%)
---
8. Druid (8%)
---
Alliance:
---
1. Warrior (17%)
---
2. Mage (14%)
---
3. Paladin (14%)
---
4. Priest (13%)
---
5. Rogue (11%)
---
6. Hunter (11%)
---
7. Warlock (10%)
---
8. Druid (10%)
---
Okay, so it's an exaggeration.  But are you trying to tell me they won't do Classic Wrath if they do Classic TBC?
---
yes, they could do the same , it's called gerrymandering.  I don't know details, but i am sure the GOP is not the only party guilty of doing this in history
---
I thought that much would be obvious. There would have to be definable and non-subjective rules against off-topic posts, not just 'Mods are free to remove posts they find cringy". Edited my post to reflect this.
---
Oh shit then I've been minning *hard*.
---
When the sun rose after the BfA release I was already max level lol, puts things into perspective.
---
Man, this thread did NOT go your way, did it? TYL that trying to tell people what is and isn't fun for them has a high chance to backfire.
---
I haven’t seen any of this yet.  Not that I have strong feelings either way, but why are there two posts about this?
---
Genuinely curious.
---
Kala has some good spriest guides on his YT/ Twitch, and will have more I imagine as we get closer to launch. He’s definitely a top tier source - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa3fonPFh9I2sa_YiFiBG8Q
---
I can't reread it ,  the comment seems to be deleted.
---
Oh nice thanks for linking that picture. So we see that it brought a whopping 2 more dps.
---
I think elven priests use "light" of Elune (and some generic "shadow"), while paladins are adepts of Church of Holy Light (that originated in Eastern Kingdoms and couldn't be known in Kalimdor).
---
No. Moderation is entirely subjective and not at all consistent. The true owners of the subreddit are its users. Let them decide with the power given to them: voting.
---
Nah don't care how many people play the class I pick.
---
Oversaturation means absolutely nothing.
---
If someone is worried about oversaturation, they aren't comfortable with their class and are afraid they'll get overshadowed by the good players of that class.
---
Either way it won't matter- If you are great at playing your class you'll attract other players that are great at their class and make friend with them.
---
If you are not so good with your class, you'll also be able to make friends, just don't be surprised when rogue number 3 gets invited before you.
---
Druids will always be the least class played. They have 1 race to choose from and don't just have 1 playstyle.
---
This applies to every game nowadays. Welcome to 2019 gaming. That said people choose for themselves how they play the game and they probably know themselves enough to decide whether or not they like to use guides or not.
---
well, for all of us old geezers that still use reddit mostly on traditional systems it would still be  a great solution.  I know because other reddits  I am active in use it....
---
Skullforged shield with a shield spike is great for farming as well.
---
You've done good work today, soldier
---
Problem is you can’t actually DO anything while stealthed. The ganking normally happens while you’re in combat or gathering. Go out for a relaxing fishing day and never get a cast off lol. Also when you’re lower level a 60 ranged can just one shot you before you know they are even there. My suggestion if you’re gonna play on PVP is make alts. That way if you do get camped you can swap and still play. Also fun to have alts of each faction.
---
Too bad Fiery Blaze is no longer obtainable, I have a Ravager sitting around on Retail :( of course even if it worked in Retail that wouldn't mean it works in Classic, but I so want to try

---
Well I guess you are right, they can be tough as nails in the right hands!
---
The best guilds I joined were DKP with loot council.
---
This is like asking what economic system is the best. Communism is bad because why would you work as a doctor if a McDonald’s employee is making as much as you.
---
And pure capitalism is bad because it will abuse workers for profit. In reality all governments are a mix of the two ( including past Soviet Russia)
---
You can’t keep a paladin cced lol.
---
I will personally make sure reddit mods ban your xenophobic racist account for peddling hate-laden pseudo-science conspiracy theories
---
I am 100% against pure loot council because I’ve had experiences of never getting any gear for months because it was a corrupt system. DKP with loot council will keep the officers honest so they can’t just give them selves gear.
---
You honestly believe that fan art and cakes are the worst part of this sub reddit?
---
Someone might say "But I plan to play Enhance, so I don't need this".
---
Ikr. Everyone is a hardcore raider too. Like for real just delete all the posts. I agree.
---
Yeah... I've resolved to not use a guide unless I'm stuck on a specific quest and nobody in chat is willing to answer.
---
Some people are gonna get real sweaty over optimized routes; but I'm not going to be one of them.
---
This is a sound argument, but it has its limits.
---
Let's assume 1,000 raiders on your realm for your faction.
---
By all the census and survey data, that means 150 to 180 warriors split across 25 raid teams.
---
Only 15% of those Warriors is every going to be the Main Tank.
---
staged posts, and softcore porn are the worst part of /r/wow not us
---
In duo leveling rogues are great thanks to constant backstabs.
---
Polymorph &gt; sap
---
Lock healthstones and Soulstones are nice for world pvp. 
---
mage cc is wonderful in pvp though.
---
A hunter wouldn't be bad but you'll compete in gear a lot more.
---
&gt; The end goal is to make new game content that doesn't go down the same path as the past. 
---
For who? You have this incredibly weird habit, throughout this entire thread, for speaking about either a grand scope or other parties. You only speak for yourself dude.
---
There are fishing guides out there that allow you to level cooking and fishing together, without the need to farm any mobs.
---
To be honest, world PvP was never really taken seriously by the devs.  This has always been the biggest gripe I've personally had with the game in general.
---
If the devs had put in place game design systems that encouraged world PvP (incentives for attacking / defending Orgrimmar for example) world PvP could have flourished, perhaps even with BGs and arenas existing simultaneously.  Advocating for new content instead of TBC is the best way of making that become reality.
---
As a solo player LF hardcore guilds I wish ppl like u ran more guilds cuz it seems to be mostly friend groups D:

Sure but he's already offtanking.  Threat isn't a huge deal usually.  Just parking the mob.
---
Probably the servers overloading.  Lets face it the servers will absolutely be overloaded at launch.
---
How about that one? You act like it was a jab at you, lad.
---
My definition includes the word arbitrary which means that everybody has a different definition, which means that if you say it's dead my next question to you is well what do you define as dead? You throw out numbers and you throw out this feeling you have, is one or the other or a combination of both?
---
And how much is this feeling related to how much you chose to play World of Warcraft? You know, those filthy words, burnout.
---
I think the main reason why paladins were restricted to dwarf and human was that while priests of other races worship a god or loa to become priests, dwarfs and humans worship the holy light.  The themes of paladin somewhat conflict with those other forms of worship, something blizzard struggles with to this day in modern wow trying to explain paladin tuaren, and zandalari trolls.  
---
In terms of the forsaken, the few examples from WC3 of paladins falling to the scourge had them all either remain dead or be turned into deathknights.  This combined with paladins specific anti-undead/anti-plague arsenal suggested a deeper incompatibility between paladins and maintaining their power through undeath.
---
That being said, blizzard isn't super consistent with the wall between undeath and being a paladin.  
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Scarlet_Commander_Marjhan
---
This character didn't exist in classic, so maybe not the best example, but is one of the few undead paladins.

I pinged 120 to Cali from Sweden so if your connection is good you are fine.
---
This - pvp servers in 2019 classic are going to be a bloodbath. If you’re not down to be forced to engage in pvp on a consistent basis after about level 40(basically when you hit STV), you shouldn’t roll on a pvp server.

What professions should my alt be? 
---
I'm rolling skinning/mining on my main (hunter) until 60, dropping skinning for engineering. I plan on taking a rogue alt to the 39 bracket.
---
Are Mara runs profitable enough to drop mining and pick up alchemy as a secondary?
---
For the rogue alt, i was thinking 2 of 3: alchemy, enchanting, tailoring. 
---
Which combinations would you recommend for a raiding hunter + rogue alt?
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah, I want to experience everything the game has to offer on my main character, and complete every quest whether its pointless or not.  while this may not be too efficient level-wise, i will also be leveling mining and blacksmithing as well as fishing/first aid/cooking....traveling to every single zone will help collect all quest recipes, all recipes exclusive to certain vendors, will help me reach exalted with all the factions, and ill make good money through mining.
---
Best analogy.
---
Aye was just thinking this the other day when I was thinking of a new video to listen to while at work. First thing that came to mind was just the weird presentation he puts out. I didn't even know what to call it, but that pretty much describes it.
---
Every. Video. Its like a roller coaster of building up his tone and it plummets the next sentence lol.
---
I wouldn't mind at all to jeep the run till classic Bfa... Like a game for the valiant
---
Yeah, can't wait for my toon to be BiS and look like an uncoordinated potato.
---
My brother wants to go Druid but he's gotten rattled after seeing all the druid bashing. What should he know starting out as a new druid primarily focused on pvp?
---
This isn't true.
---
TBC raiding was over-tuned as fuck when it landed, *for sure.* SSC and TK were a clusterfuck of nope until they were re-balanced, coincidentally, when BT and Hyjal were ready for primetime. They were still going for the "variety of raids" design at that point, and those 2 bosses were the limiting factors preventing access.
---
I've played with people in those uber-hardcore guilds who think sitting on a boss for 26 hours is going to make you "better" at the fight, but the reality is they were never intended to be killed.
---
Then there was the extreme item-level power creep. The incremental gains from raid-to-raid in WoW Classic were largely non-significant. For a Rogue in Classic, going from full 8/8 Nightslayer to full 8/8 Bloodfang (T1 to T2) was a difference of +7 stam, +50 AP, -0.5% crit, and +1% hit (also +2% dodge, and Immunity to Disarm.) A pure DPS class basically gained ~20 DPS, or about 5% damage. It was so non-consequential, it was often better to not wear a full set. 
---
This shit wasn't true at all in TBC. Itemization was far, far too plentiful and itemization was now being devised by a formula to ensure harder difficulty content always produced better loot (and significantly more of it in terms of drops per-raider.) The only itemization being designed by humans in TBC were tier set bonuses, and for DPS specs, they always had to create a power spike instead of providing utility like in Classic, meaning they were now basically mandatory. Passive resistances were also gone as to not degrade the potency of items.
---
All of the difficulty in TBC raiding was manufactured. The lack of future content being finished or players trying to do content that was tuned for gear they simply didn't have because it actually mattered now, was the difference.
---
If I was a game designer in TBC-era WoW, assuming the raid content was actually ready for prime time, almost nothing would have changed except for the itemization power creep. Replacing all of your gear just makes the world smaller.
---
Tankless is actually best for melee cleave. 3-4 dps warriors and a healer is all you need.
---
Please stop
---
Per se*
---
Ugh, this. 
---
I might add:
---
„Unpopular opinion: *quite popular opinion. *“
---
If your pugging then ya sure, but you could make the shadowmeld argument for literally any class. 
---
Wars have the only healing reduction skill in the game and this makes them the best shot callers. If your not in the frontline calling targets for your team, your not doing ur job correctly. MS is a death sentence for anyone who has it, if the team piles them.
---
If 85% of people leave because of non mandatory aesthetics they are small-minded as hell.
---
I wish the mods would institute something like “meme Monday” so people can get it out of their system and farm their karma.
---
Nah.  It was because of the crazy tight dps checks in early sunwell progression.  Entire classes got sat on m'uru because they couldn't swing enough dick.  A guild's luck on warglaives and dst's had a huge impact on whether they would clear muru the first few months.  Retarded guilds also struggled with felmyst calls.  
---
You see it in bfa with the mythic leaderboards too.  Certain classes absolutely dominate and others aren't seen in any of the top 100 group comps.  Tends to come down to good mobile aoe dps and good tank aoe stuns.
---
Apparently Druids are a must for WS as flag carrier in pre mades
---
No doubt. Sounds a lot more fulfilling than rushing to 60. Keep in mind that it might be difficult to find those underlevel quests as they won’t show up on your minimal. As for quests you don’t want to miss, it might help to do a quick read through joanas leveling guide. There may be a few quests that appear out of the way but flow well with his guide that you might otherwise miss
---
You can also kill mages with gnome racial, spider belt, and rocket helm, 3 charges and 2 ways to escape novas.  And maybe even rocket boots on top of all of it.
---
I dont think you understand just how much money and time it would take to test and develop "Classic+". If you truly believe there is a scenario in which they would ever consider this venture a better option than an already rave reviewed TBC expansion you are completely out of touch with reality.
---
The difference is in the order of 10s of millions of dollars. Even if they wanted to do it I they probably wouldn't.
---
People like you can write these walls of text until the end of time but it wont change how time and money works.
---
its hard to decide to what is most powerful ... 
---
what does that mean ... every class has something insane about it for pvp. 
---
shaman - elemental is super strong and ehnacement but with "mc gear" its gonna be hard but not imposible
---
paladin both retri and holy are crazy good
---
huntard survival hibrid or marksman is always super versatile
---
druid you have to carry flag best in the game but you also have some neet abilities for group play later on (skrimishing etc), just do hybrid pvp spec and you are golden all around.
---
warrior - Mortal strike no further discussion needed snowballs with healer
---
priest - shadow insane across the board, holy best pvp healer 
---
mage - frost is crazy good arcane is one trick pony but viable
---
warlock - its pretty strong, i think people here think overestimate power of soul link , yes its super powerful and tanky but reallistically that build is made to kill mages and huntards and such... melee classes generally rape you at mc level. But actually all 3 warlock specs are good all around for entire vanila. 
---
rogue - super strong all around , just play assasination and be good with it and you are aleardy mini demi god. 
---
beauty of vanila is all classes have something strong about them for pvp and i remember when i played for r14 we used all specs all the time... some had more spots then the others tho obviously.
---
If classic+ includes class and spec improvements at least as good as TBC's then I think  a large majority of the community could rally behind Classic+, I don't think anyone is attached to a specific dungeon to the degree people are attached to their characters, and new content is always cool.
---
But we already KNOW TBCs class designs are next level... Why gamble on the current devs out doing them? You can pick and poke at silly details of the upgraded classes, but it's still a better starting point than vanilla design.   Mages water elemental breaking warlock class ID?  Please... By that logic warriors and rogues being able to shoot bows and arrows breaks hunter class id
---
There's a looot a great content in TBC besides class design, but I would be happy to see it cannibalized and used as fodder for classic+ the only part that's not negotiable is the class/spec improvements.
---
And no one said you can't work on the classes from there.  it's just a known "better" state to base improvements from.
---
#nochanges
---
You are absolutely right with everything you said. Take my upvote. 
---
Others: read what he said.
---
These simulations is garbage, they don't even have the same durations.
---
Adjusting for that, the Gnome would have ~19 more DPS than the Mage.
---
But a simulation only using 45 casts is very much garbage.
---
Druids aren't rogues true. But a good kittt dps pulls crazy numbers. Check out Shedo the druid on youtube he's shredding it up.
---
A lot of people I've spoken to have expressed their interest in "having fun" this time around in classic and rolling hunters and warlocks, whatever that is supposed to mean. I dunno if it's because they can level efficiently solo or quickly or what.
---
Me personally, I'm not worried too much about playing a saturated class since I'm confident in my abilities and going into the game with a guild already.
---
Worrying about class saturation might make more sense for PUGs and solo folk though.
---
Summoning stones didn't led to LFD. The casualization of raids that wotlk created transformed the end game for the average player from dungeons to raids.
---
There are 3 types of players
---
Casuals, in vanilla/tbc had fun leveling, doing stuff just for fun, and if they eventually got to max level, they would make a dungeon not for gear, but for fun.
---
Average players in vanilla/tbc played dungeons. Easy to get 5 people, not too much preparation was needed, and they could try to get some upgrades to their gear.
---
Tryhards in vanilla/tbc went to raid, raids were for the 10% of players.
---
This change of mentality on blizzard that everyone needed to see everything led to dungeons being less important, as those were made for farming, a small step between a fresh max level character and a raid ready one, or to leveling and making sure that the player is always geared.
---
With dungeons being not as important as before, wow needed to make those easier to find a group and to enter (and literally using LFD gave rewards to reflect this), so they could start to play the content designed for them.
---
With the obvious first step, lets get rid of fucking layering.
---
By what a factor of .04? That’s nothing. Yea weapon skill helps, but if your trying to flurry tank you should be using petitions blade, a dagger, and if you want mitigation you should be using a sword with good stats.
---
So cringe
---
they are the deadest in retail. vanilla is a mmo so comparing them is redundant.
---
You're telling me.
---
One simulation is 4 seconds longer than the other. You don't go from 2 more to 19 more dps in 4 seconds.
---
TBC didn't lead to Wrath any more than vanilla did by simply precessing it.
---
Cata didn't kill WoW. The game has survived way past it's expiration date.
---
New content, particularly when catch-up content is included, makes old content obsolete. There are ways to mitigate this, but it's inevitable.
---
Vanilla meeting stones had one function: they allowed you to queue for a dungeon, and would form your group for you. Feel free to look it up if you weren't around in vanilla.
---
Okay, I've gotta clear this up because BFD is the dungeon every caster absolutely should run.
---
The wand from the quest there [Gravestone Scepter] is a 29 dps wand. FROM A QUEST. That you can have in your early 20's. That is the highest DPS weapon in the game for that level (I believe).
---
To quote Kargoz, "That wand is the **truth**"
---
19 is really boring. Yes, you're OP and can 1-shot not-twinks, but it's not that enjoyable. Your toolkit is small and there's no real finesse. 29 is better, but if you're willing to put the time in, 39 was my favorite bracket. On the plus side, you can get professions maxxed.
---
Because up vote and down vote is not *supposed* to work that way. Not between what you don't like and do like. 
---
People lie, no one believes the "my gf did x" posts that pop up a lot. That's why people are sick of such posts.
---
Although I recall in arathi basic jumping off the mill, popping the cloak, and floating right on top of the flag. If I recall correctly ou could cap the mill and land on the center flag less than 10 secondsa later
---
Man I play wow but some of you guys are serious nerds.
