Maybe it doesn't make sense to reserve items in a 40 man PUG then.

I have a 3 monitor setup. The main monitor is where all the money is spent because that‚Äôs what I game on. The other 2 are yard sale pickups used for anything else.

All streamers at Twitch Con so they aren't logging into the streamer server and their spurgs aren't logging in either.

Enjoy the low login queue weekend, and expect this in the future if Asmongold goes back to retail.
---
Dude literally saved the orcs, made Kalimdor the Horde's promised land where they could finally start to live free, and later when retail writers started heroin he ascended to godhood,. I don't see how anyone could be a better leader.
---
Actually it was exactly that people want epics (any high value BoE) and don‚Äôt need them.  ‚ÄúIf they needed them, they would already have them‚Äù, remember?
---
Found the guy who ninja loots and wants to justify it.
---
Sorry but ‚Äúbeing shitty‚Äù should never be an accepted part of the game. The rules are stated up front and should be followed... because know what your way gets everyone? The raid finder in retail , ‚Äúpersonal loot‚Äù, and the complete removal of all feeling of achievement for actually gearing up.
---
Just don‚Äôt be a shitty person.
---
OF course it does matter.
---
Loot rules don't exist in a vacuum. 
---
If someone is spamming "LFM Onyxia, guild people get priority on loot" I bet most people wouldn't join. But if enough join and allow them to complete the raid why wouldn't they reserve loot?
---
Don't like it? Don't join.

best place to farm runecloth?

True

Now take into consideration the fact that Blizzard increased the population caps soon after launch. Also consider the fact that "full" doesn't mean 4-5 times the population, but like 2-3 times. Also consider that "medium" doesn't have to mean exactly the population of a full Vanilla server, but it starts generally around it being a full Vanilla server, and it could display "Medium" while being 1.5 times that of a Vanilla server.
---
Anyway, realistically most servers would drop from 3000 players on Vanilla down to about 1500 players. 1500 players is not a dead server, especially with Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms being the only continents. No Outlands, no Northrend, etc etc. Vanilla/Classic content is better suited for lower population than future expansions.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Guaranteed most servers wouldn't be dead. Not at this point.
---
I agree that in the future of about 3+ months that many servers would be dead. But not 1 month after release. And certainly not on weekends.
---
My experience almost exactly, loving this "vanilla raids are so ez my dog solos them".  Some guys saying that went in and wiped on baron and garr a bunch, SUPER elite and informed.
---
Amazing
---
Offhand equipped weapons give less damage as a balance measure I believe
---
\#justvanillathings
---
been doing more or less the same thing, level 32 lock still using the staff you get for completely the main deadmines quest, still have at least 2 pieces that are  lower than level 20, there's just no point buying gear when people keep over pricing everything good. Just because someone wants to charge 4 gold for a level 30 staff with stam/intel doesn't mean anyone is going to pay that price, the fact that there are already 8 up for the same price not moving should have been a hint.
---
Enjoying WoW classic for the first time, as well. Played in Burning Crusade, but I'm happy to revisit the classic experience! That's on the mount!!
---
I‚Äôm playing a Warrior and i‚Äôm hoping I can get away with only playing tank after I hit 60 - I can‚Äôt think of a reason i‚Äôd need to go DPS really.
---
Weapon speed
---
That's one argument you could make.
---
Before the first expansion, if you looked past the hype, you saw the storm coming.
---
If he can make you what he considers the Other, he can instantly invalidate your statements.
---
I technically have played once before. 20 minutes of retail last year. Maybe less. My friend convinced me to play and I got bored so fast. I‚Äôve seen videos of retail and I‚Äôve watched my friend play, and WoW never interested me before now. It seemed like there was no point in getting into it as a new player. Classic sucked me in though. Anybody can play it.
---
It's always been a shit rule
---
Stamina --&gt; Health --&gt; Mana?  Still pretty terrible but it looks warlocky at least.
---
Druids are tier 1 for dungeon tanking, dont give up the hope
---
How do people create two actions to a key?
---
i.e. saw someone where if he just pressed 1, he would cast sinister strike. if he pressed shift+1, it would cast kidney shot.
---
You call for peace when it suits you, little lion.
---
Because your dps will go up and it's fun. Need? Probably not. Fun and worth it? You decide.
---
During primetime it's pretty common to have a team from each faction ganking each other to try and get the one lone devilsaur wandering around.
---
You know you can hide action bars right?
---
how do you figure?  calling him an obnoxious loot whore is angry?
---
Pull a Game of Thrones season 8. Give it to Nat Pagle.
---
anything that is stam/intel, or stam/strength, or stam/agil will probably sell unless you overprice the fuck out of it.
---
Please read the comments for the love of god
---
Yup
---
BRD is really easy once you have the key, can even do arena without killing extra mobs.
---
Don‚Äôt worry little druidling, things get better quick. As other posters have said, level 10 brings Bear Form, where you‚Äôll spend most of your time fighting most things until Cat Form comes online at level 20. Bear Form is still a good idea as you‚Äôre much hardier until level 32 when you get your first real finisher for Cat Form in Ferocious Bite. 
---
Once you start down the talent trees, stick in Feral (especially when you get the two points at level 20 + 21 to make Cat Form move faster). 
---
Good luck!
---
So you‚Äôre grabbing the chicken nuggets with your toes for optimal laziness right?
---
Do people really farm the Sunken Temple stuff? It sounds like a massive pain and hard to make parties for.
---
well yes and no, the mass is poor, me and my guildies (lv 60) are worth 1-2k+ each and we're having fun watching people trying hard to make  a 5 silver margin on things lol.you just have to know what you can overprice, herb ? no. leather ? no. that bis hunter sword ? hell yes. Sell stuff that lv 50+ needs and you'll see the gold flowing in ! anyone above lv 40-50 is making more money than he thinks he is just doing quests and stuff. The "i'm broke" mentality is the real problem
---
I‚Äôd imagine there‚Äôs people on both sides of that dumb fence
---
Why this was hilarious to me:
---
* level 12 peaseant undead was somehow flagged for pvp
---
* he walked up to me and did /beg
---
* so i punched him
---
* then i laid down and he started wanding me
---
* that random dude on the horse came by to watch
---
* when i took out my axe the undead rapidly mashed "Q" and "E" (strafe to symbolize a "NO!!!") motion
---
* he saw his impending doom
---
and naturally it was a 400 dmg 1-shot crit lol
---
You can hide action bars if you know your keybinds well.
---
That is far and away the most populated server isn‚Äôt it? Doesn‚Äôt Asmongold play on it? Probably pretty different from most servers. I could be wrong though, don‚Äôt have a max level warrior yet.
---
Literally cool flex
---
That same logic can be applied the other way around to all dps warriors. "But they cleave!!!!", yes they do. And rogues have 27 types of interrupts and higher single target dps.
---
I'd the weapon skill maxed in both? Don't know if it is what's happened but it's something to check.
---
Off hand weapons do less damage. You're never as good with your off hand. Warriors have a talent in fury that brings it up a bit to even it out more but still always does less damage.
---
    /cast [mod:shift] Kidney Shot; Sinister Strike
---
Good healers will downrank their heals and use whatever free time they have to drink. If im over 50 percent and you dont go to ham on the pull it should be a smooth run. 
---
Dont freak out unless the tank is the one dipping hard while you drink even in combat. 
---
Its a skill picked up in retail for sure and its easy to triage and drink when possible without needing 100 percent mana before each little pull
---
Flew from darnassus to un'goro and it took 24 minutes. Yikes.
---
Ever consider you‚Äôre part of the problem?
---
You should treat yourself better.
---
It makes it easier to treat others better. Have fun with the game.
---
Questie
---
Its a 10m cd for the 20 int and its a trash weapon for pvp and pve
---
Nevermind I'm a dumb ass. Weapon speed

I could not imagine staring at a female troll or orc for that many hours

You guys are insane
---
Learn to move and drink old man.

Precisely

Find it unfair this can happen with blacksmithing but theres literally only 4 black lotus in the world at once every hour.
---
Im actually kinda liking the eng idea. May start out as double gathering to make more money to get my bis gear. Only thought now is, do i go mining and store EVERYTHING or herbalism and sell everything
---
But they're both 2 hand weapons?
---
Me too, me too. And all I got was an underground river
---
Grats!
---
He said nobody has money to spend. Of course it was a flex, it's how i disproved his point.
---
I have the same keyboard. Protip, don't spill any liquids within a mile of it.
---
Misinformed. Please point out to me in the terms of service where it states this.
---
Hell yeah man! Welcome! I hope you really enjoy it as much as I did at 15 for my first time!
---
Keep on keeping on.
---
It will emerge sooner or later üòÖ
---
I've had no issue selling the few BOE weapons I've found so far but that's because I'm asking for 1G max on level 20+ weapons, there are people out there that want 15G for a lvl 19 weapon and that's just not going to happen until BG twinks are a thing.
---
That is not "running a dungeon", that is a class killing a boss for you till you get a BiS ring. You effectively buy the item, you dont pay for going to do dungeons.
---
You want a slow weapon as a warrior because when you get mortal strike it does more damage. Slower weapons equal bigger hits when you get those instant hit skills. It sucks until 40 though. I was using fury. Felt like more rage but you miss alot
---
Sex in 2019 when people have MMORPG, VR and Disneyland and food'n'drugs and all this kind of shit to entertain themselves.  
---
Don't be so egoistic and let her enjoy the game! Obviously she wants WOW not SEX.
---
I spent forty minutes searching for my $g
---
Honestly the game for me really starting taking off after hitting 45, strangely enough. 35-45 is the worst bracket personally.
---
I think the majority of alliance players, or at least mages, are gnomes. And from my experience leveling, they have been the only aggressors. I can't recall a single dwarf that attacked me ever. Humans and night elves I can count on one hand. Gnome mages on the other hand...
---
priest can farm mara, see hydra vods
---
Not really, don't think so.
---
Would I join? FUCK NO.
---
I'd tell not to join to anyone who asked me about it.
---
Yeah people seem to really love SM for some reason. I just dinged 41 and I only ran SM Lib one time, haven't even entered any of the other three lol.
---
Are you sure that the proc-rate is 10% for direct damage spells? Because that is good enough to make it pre-bis for warlocks and mages.
---
We need to know this! Orcs get +5 axe weapon skill but that's still a large discrepency. It must be that you aren't fully trained up in maces?
---
Wtf you do?? Mine only has wow.
---
You having to sit and drink after isn't more efficient than keeping relatively neutral mana and health.
---
This exact reasoning is why I re rolled to shadow priest. My leveling experience has been mostly solo and I'm not having fun playing holy. I'm having fun melting mobs and people who try to gank me. I'm having fun, fuck the haters
---
Youre posting this again?
---
It‚Äôs only for certain NPCS and low level stuff like that. Not players
---
Yeah, should have waited until the druid engaged the next yeti before attacking.
---
It's not off hand
---
How happy are u about the reroll? I also have a shaman as alt
---
Shouldn't affect damage, just DPS.
---
????
---
Pay attention to yer cats damnit!
---
That‚Äôs just wrong.
---
Half-orc ! And way bigger than 6'5", an orc is already bigger than a human (even ingame, about 1 head taller), and Rexxar, thanks to his ogre blood, might very well be 1 and a half orcs tall. Dude is massive.
---
this is literally heaven!
---
This is so me it hurts.
---
Yeah sure, better just 20m it
---
That's kind of the difference though.  Complaining about having 20 cloth casters sharing loot is different then having a few Spriests where you'd otherwise slot in locks/mages.
---
because the OT is probably their MT or OT and the OP (MT in this case is a pug). either way, no. just no.
---
What kind of eq points have you chosen there? I noticed that the default one for druid tank is not that good
---
i probably will but I will also end up macroing a lot of my spells with alt keys and such.
---
&gt;Warrior is by far the most played and most groups are looking for DDs, or sometimes a heal.
---
I can fill a group with healer and 3 dps in minutes.
---
I also get spam whispered about going and tank Strat/Scholo/UBRS/Whatever.
---
I'm still leveling on the server, Horde side, and it feels extremely balanced. Might be a slight skew to Alliance during leveling and a slight skew to Horde at 60 whenever I do a /who every now and then. The only thing is that population overall, while it's still growing, is not as big as the other servers. Honestly I prefer it this way because there's still groups for dungeons during peak times while still be able to quest and grind in almost any spot without much competition. Population is Low during offhours at like 3AM and Medium throughout the day and night, weekends as well. 
---
Join the server discord if you have any questions too - it's a small and relatively balanced server at the moment and we're hoping it stays that way.
---
Doesn't say anything about that in the link
---
So? There's a place for people like that and it's rp servers. Let them have fun. If you're making fun of people who are super into rp you really shouldn't be on an rp server.
---
Don‚Äôt upvote this guy, literally commented on the original post and was extremely toxic. Get a life.
---
People bring locks even though they don't get to use their full debuffs.  Spriests can be effective without SWP.
---
I am legit so confused then. It makes no sense!
---
I turned the add-on off and it still shows the same numbers. So it doesn't seem to be the add-on.
---
Stop bragging!
---
Makes us sub-40s jealous!
---
Heartseeker, more alliance than horde
---
The difference between 15 rage and 100 rage when entering the execute phase is like... 1125 damage sans criticals. That sounds a lot, but consider that the base damage of Execute is almost 3 times as rage efficient as the rage drain of it (and exactly 4 times as rage efficient if you have Improved Execute). Wouldn't you do more in total by just using your regular damage abilities as normal?
---
And the Classic client runs so well, I have pegged 141 fps basically everywhere. I know the client is based on the Legion client, but Legion often dropped to the 60 range in raids. And I'm running higher quality settings than I did in Legion. 
---
Seems like they backported the multicore optimizations from current BfA, but I don't know for sure (I quit BfA before the engine optimization patch dropped).
---
Why are you playing on an RP realm if you're not going to adhere to the rules?
---
It's like going to a nudist beach in clothes. There's specific criteria because some people enjoy it, so let them have their fun and roll on a standard realm.
---
The post above you meant buying their skills from a trainer, not training up their sword/etc skill... I think, just to clarify not trying to be a know it all
---
Never overheal, best mana efficiency everytime you need to heal (cloth vs vs plate vs tank vs minimum damage etc)
---
Na, they just did that at their desks if they wanted to.
---
if you dont care about RP, why be on one?
---
Wow has an economy that is funded by looting copper/silver at a time. Inflation will happen causing prices to go up because new money is being introduced to the economy every day, just like a real life economy.
---
yea. while scummy, they did announce it before the boss/loot actually dropped, so it could have been much worse. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
either way, it is very scummy.
---
I can second the German audio, English subs. The English voice acting ruins it for me. It just sounds... off.
---
It can also be done much faster by groups, but people like you never would because that would \*gasp\* require talking to people, and how dare you talk to someone in an MMO.
---
No really, you say that as if boxers are the only one who do that - guild groups and pug groups do too. You either BE social, or BECOME the social.
---
Re: Pay to Win: How exactly are they winning by paying? All they do is pay their sub, just like you and 4 friends would. Paying does not directly give them an [iWin button](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18230/broken-i-w-i-n-button) \- it only means he spends less time LFGing (but more time setting the damn thing up to make it work, which tards like you never think about how much work goes into MAKING it work, you just see 5 spells going off at once and start grunting like panicked cavemen)
---
Funniest for me is people trying to sell 19 twink gear for 100+g... When there won't be BGs for 2 more phases lol
---
Yeah but with 2019 mentality and a lot of competition for spots having BiS definitely helps your position on a server.
---
No one has ever accused an asshole who tops dps or healing meters of being dead weight.
---
What's that sword from? I remember having that years ago but can't remember where I got it
---
Just because people don't play by your expectations, they aren't dicks. If you are looking to buy an item for 150gold and someone tells you he is willing to sell it for 180gold, he isn't a dick. He simply makes you an offer that you can accept or deny. Same with the tanks offering to _do something for you by filling up your group_ and putting a price tag on their service of helping out.  
---
I am not sure why I try to explain you this though, as seen in this thread your stubbornness and entitlement is unbreakable and "they are bad, you are right" is all you are arguing.
---
Some.say he is still sitring there playing to this day
---
Yeah I got downvoted hard lol
---
I get it. But it would be real easy for a third party site to phish your account login by sending you to a battle.net lookalike. And yeah I'm sure that the gazette is legit, but what if they get hacked and start sending people to phishing sites, without the owners knowing. 
---
I just don't understand why they feel the need to get your battlenet login to show you some data that isn't even relevant to your personal account.
---
I think you might have found a serious bug in the game itself. Can you run any basic tests, like do 20 white attacks with each one equipped and post all the numbers here?
---
That's a strange conclusion I haven't seen before...
---
As a raid leader in OG vanilla our deadweights were very bad players not the good players who rightfully complained about the deadweight.
---
The main problem was shedding deadweight without causing drama.  Just had to trim a few here and there when we had replacements lining up to join the guild.
---
I would favor pallies, in bg's. I played a priest forever but rolled pally this time around. I feel like it shines more with the utility while still having good heals. The main advantage of pallies is being able to survive more (bubble, bop, freedom, wearing plate + shield, etc)
---
Both can be great fun though so pick what you prefer!
---
That's not true at all lol

I just try to run with my guild they rarely disappoint me.
---
Now I know why people say ‚ÄúPosture check‚Äù
---
You might have an argument on alliance side, but for horde druids, you‚Äôll find better trinkets from quest rewards and HoJ will stay on that rogue for 4 raids.
---
There is no pre raid bis item with 60-100 healing power.
---
Pre raid this is one of your best items. You will get benediction in 2 or 3 weeks of molten core runs. You really misunderstand the need of spirit and stamina for boss fights that take 5+ minutes, or getting nuked by a random RNG spell from a boss.
---
Not to forget the talent  Spiritual Guidance ‚Äî Allows you to convert up to 25% of your Spirit into Spell Power, making it so that you get more value out of Spirit as a stat, which is great when Spirit is a decent stat to get in the first place.
---
As far as spirit goes for regen  in combat it‚Äôs about 8 spirit gives 2 mana per tick, which is the same as 5mp5. Fights in BGs last a long time you could be fighting constantly on a nod for 5 + minutes.
---
I started playing in 2005, I really didn‚Äôt understand how ever thing worked until the release of BC. When I leveled really quickly and joined the top progression guild, and was taught all the mechanics. I didn‚Äôt even realize I had to down rank my healing spells in classic, that‚Äôs how bad I was.
---
Have you asked your parents if they would consider getting some professional help for their issues?  Seriously not antagonizing here, but healthy people do not enable to this degree.  There‚Äôs something else wrong there.
---
What server you on?
---
I have no problem with it. I just find it funny. I heard RP servers have good communities so I joined one.
---
I only tank for my friends now.
---
Most pugs just forget to turn their brains on from my experiences
---
burn them
---
there are rules?
---
It's an Alliance guild :)
---
Go back to barrens chat
---
If I (a tank) gain no item upgrades from tanking a run for you and instead ask for gold for my time, that skeeves you?
---
how does +magic and +shadow damage gear work with warlock spells? does +magic work on all spells but +shadow only works on spells that do shadow damage, or does +magic not work on shadow damage spells?
---
I heard they have good communities
---
What do you mean "they've"????
---
Yes. My main in retail was always a mage and it was never a problem I would give out as much water as needed. For some reason there is a subset of mages that find it sooooo hard to cast the spell
---
&gt;If found dead please res 
---
This is my favorite on the various servers I've been on.
---
Did you forget to dot up the one the void is tanking? It should almost die from one set of dots.
---
*resisted*
---
And that same logic is why most DPS warriors either pay for tanking, wait hours for a group, or slap on a shield and do the tanking (in return for reserved loot or by excluding competition, effectively doing the same).
---
What's your point?
---
WF is on weapon swing. HoJ is on melee hit. There is a distinction there.
---
Not helpful, Kevin.
---
Shatter combos are a thing in classic. There's just no ice lance. Your 2nd spell will be cone of cold or fire blast.
---
right, so with 35 other slots available... you could fill your raid with anybody wielding anything
---
I tried retail a while back because a friend of mine asked me to.  Wasn't my cup of tea, and I love MMO's.  Decided to give Classic a shot on launch day and I fucking love it.  It's a damn good game, no wonder people played the shit out of this in 2004.
---
garbage
---
Its doom weed you dingus
---
I just think this dude plays for fun instead of guild progress, sure you're going to have fun but your guild isn't going anywhere if you're D tier dps gets gear your S tier dps could've gotten to progress.
---
&gt;Example: What if a hunter tried to roll for dal rends?
---
Then said hunter should be pointed towards Peacemaker, explained +15agi on 1h weapon isn't in game atm, and shown a +9 int on 2h weapon.
---
If he still insists DalRends are his BiS kick him from the raid, he's useless anyway.
---
Not everyone has the time to carry a bunch of garbage players. Must be nice.
---
&gt; Only garr has resistances above what coe shaves off and fire dps &gt; arcane frost dps with -75 resistance.
---
I thought negative resistances haven't meant anything since the early days of vanilla?
---
because they do RP.
---
You can't be serious. There are naming rules you have to adhere to at the very least. Don't be surprised if you get reported and forcibly changed.
---
classic is starting to bleed players heavily but nobody would want to admit that. Queues are practically gone for most servers and flist are half as full as they once were.
---
Not that it's the same as ubrs, but I laugh every time I see people asking specifically for bear tanks for instances with no leather drops.
---
It does become game breaking when there's a group, or even just 1 person to camp the people that take res sickness to try and escape and get picked off again on spawn.
---
Yes there are.
---
I've been messing around with it, and it's not awful for dungeons. just feels weird casting immolate over and over, haha. Shadowbolt for fire immunes, and for wpvp being able to explode someone is nice.
---
Uptoke for the sherlock bubbler
---
I miss getting paid to tank
---
You just have to punch up. My favourite is to take on groups.
---
If you lose, oh well you were outnumbered. Usually manage to grab one of them anyways. 
---
But if you win? Oh god, just imagine the humiliation of an entire group of 2 or 3 getting killed by a single Gnome rogue as he has /laugh bound to all his ability macros (I don't actually have this, but I just thought of it and now I will)
---
Agreed. And that's why people appreciate good tanks and healers so much. But you are in the group for gear and xp just like everyone else, not out of the goodness of your heart. Which is why I said that reserving gear just because you are playing a certain role is selfish.
---
Abandon take quest give you a new one :) but need to walk for that so I understand you
---
You can't. If you want to stay relevant for next phases you have to do MC/Ony every week, thus stay subscribed.
---
There are addition rules for RP servers, one of them is a naming policy. Meaning you can only name your character something which is an actual name, not "Leetboixyz" for example. Judging from this image it hasnt happened yet but if someone reported you in game I'm fairly sure you'd be forced to name change.
---
Not possible without an add-on.
---
One reason they have good communities because people feel they can have fun without being mocked. Posts like this do not help promote that community.
---
Nope. [Skarm tanks Nef as Druid and gets turned into a cat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_lcsqkKCY) Now sure, Skarm is out-gearing the raid, but it's absolutely not instant death.
---
Would love to have you come to Bleameux and join my guild.
---
You seem mad
---
That's good to know. Will I be required to use Fire Bolt? I can live with it but I never liked mixing elements. i.e if I'm frost I'd rather just use frost based moves. Not a deal breaker either way though.
---
I dunno what vanilla experience you had, but in mine it was not about the "meta" at all.
---
I raided as ret, even after 1.9.
---
I wouldn't say they mean *different* things, they just _refer_ to different things. 
---
A cookie-cutter build is a meta build within that scope, but not every cookie-cutter build is a meta build. Kinda like how every spoke is a rod but not every rod is a spoke.
---
Mages are the true hydro homies
---
I can understand why they did it, I just think having us focusing on one BG when they‚Äôve been out for 15 years is pretty lame lmao
---
What‚Äôs wrong with paying a tank? You sound like a total douchebag bruh
---
Magic works on all spells and shadow only works on shadow. So if you have +50 magic and +50 shadow then you have +100 shadow
---
Please don't listen to anyone giving diagnostic advice on this subreddit, especially whatever the fuck it is you replied to. I am a Psych NP. Your brother needs help with addiction issues related to video games as well as whatever undiagnosed and untreated medical issues he has. 
---
You won't find this type of help on here, especially not from people who regurgitate a wiki-how article on the most common drugs used to treat bipolar disorder. If you PM me with what region you're in I can  point you towards actual help.
---
Yep.. was going to come say this. OP.. if you see this, turn that fan around! Hot air rises! Blow it out the top.
---
I agree. Am 42 right now and am having trouble just questing. I've been living in dungeons to avoid it. I never feel like I have enough quests. All of them are too high a level. Or I'm constantly bouncing between zones. Idk. Maybe I just don't know where to quest. Been bouncing between STV and badlands the last few levels.
---
Not sure when I should go to tanaris or what.
---
So I've got my Warlock to 30, about to make my way to SM.  Anyone I've talked to about the game said to just keep the imp out dungeons, void walker for solo questing.  Can anyone tell me a time I can enjoy my other summons?  Just got my succubus. Fully speced into affliction at the moment.
---
Almost certainly, and this was done with only the video in mind. Im not even hit capped. lol
---
Lmao ally does the same thing. Assholes on both sides.
---
Ah, so Steve is the master Gordo was talking about!
---
My set up is kinda like this, had to do it because my ass was starting to really hurt after long sessions lol
---
No one is saying that tanks/healers have the same demand as dps. You don't have to strawman.
---
Because they're fucking pirates.
---
I bought a level 30 hammer for 4 gold. Was definitely a worthwhile investment.
---
I mean with what Addon can I do that :)
---
thanks
---
I've been there. You're living the good life
---
Being able to mitigate crushing blows shouldn't be considered as a negative point; that's why prot warriors are even a thing. Has nothing to do with threat or armor %, everything is based around being able to mitigate the crushing blow, which is something only warriors can do.
---
Trying to twink before BGs are out is real dumb
---
&gt;IIRC, you can get a DK at some point to, in killing grey con players, not sure if it is a thing yet though.
---
That has never been a thing. People in this subreddit were suggesting it should be a thing before classic came out, but it has never been in a live version of the game.
---
I remember getting picked up for some ZF runs and I would get 3 to 5 gold for going in some MC drops
---
Our server is swamped with fishing bots.  NO WAY multiple people (at least 10) fished up 35+ stacks of lobsters and 25+ stacks of nightfin snapper.
---
That‚Äôs not even including what they have listed as cooked food.
---
Little GoogleFu and I found what they‚Äôre using.  Hoping they get the ban hammer.
---
Thank you.  I did the uncle quest as indicated on wowhead but not the aunt quest. Cheers.
---
Where is yours?
---
I think the problem here is calling an offspec a trash player....
---
Neither of these dudes is right.  One is wrong for calling all non-cookie cutter specs trash players and the other is wrong thinking bad players are somehow not deadweight.
---
Plenty of cookie cutter mages that are deadweight.  And plenty of offspecced classes that carry raids.  It's just harder to do as the "offspec" but it sure as hell isn't impossible.  MC/Ony are fucking cake walks.   That's why when you look at a mage just sucking hard on DPS and facepullings adds and shit and you wonder how god damn low their IQ has to be to fuck up free loot runs.
---
100% correct.  People don‚Äôt have the gold yet and are way more disciplined.
---
Truth. Been fun seeing how this works. I took a gamble on buying up medium hides I thought were too low, flipped em and now the price is holding and I'm still still selling. Pretty cool :)
---
If you‚Äôre a retail player sure.
---
Started Holy, stayed Holy.
---
Banquet
---
For sure, queue starts around 3pm EST on weekdays and hits a 3hr queue by 5pm. Kinda regret picking that server since idgaf about the streamers, but my friends are on it and I don't wanna risk a server transfer putting me into a dead server
---
By "banned" he means banned in duel tournaments. SL is very strong 1v1 and 2v2. Probably the best solo base defender in WSG and AB. However Destruction is going to do a lot more damage in large group situations, and the survivability from SL is worth a lot less when you have other classes to heal and peel for you.
---
You really can't go wrong with any spec. Just learn to play to its strengths. Battlegrounds and world PvP are varied enough that you can make yourself useful everywhere regardless of your spec. If you want to be a duel pro, yeah SL is the way to go.
---
he'd be a mercenary. why does that remind you of hookers? what the fuck are you smoking lol
---
People are just so used to the inflation brought on by over a decade of WoW's terrible economy and gold buyers.
---
The answer to your question is.......because......... Warrior.
---
Omg amazing this looks so cozy
---
Since you're already such a high level you can make decent money so if you go mining your can just buy ore to level your mining and dont have to go running around for hours to level it up to your current level then you can stock pile the more expensive mats. Wowhead has a list of what it takes to get any profession from 1 to 300.
---
Disclaimer on eng, you want to go gnomish first and get a couple of the BoP items then unlearn engineering all together and relevel it back up and go goblin. Gnomish has some good items that you can only get from making them but you dont have to be gnomish to use them, you just have to have a certain eng level. Goblin is what gives you all the best bombs.
---
Is the arena working? I thought that was a phase 2 thing.
---
Was saying this in another thread, too, but I find it hilarious that they chanted Daisy in a relatively small way, but the Succubi still spank themselves and moan in their little bikinis.
---
Priorities.
---
It's the druid code. If a druid is not friendly you can report them to cenarion circle for breach of contract.
---
Not possible with classic macros.
---
That is like the only stuff I actually try to put on the AH and I have about a 50% success ratio, and I'm always pricing it as the cheapest on there.
---
Like I had two pieces of lvl 40 plate stam/str stuff, I figure warriors might buy up plate pieces upon being able to use it but neither sold.
---
Fuck that community hows that hahahah?
---
Indeed... I didn't make it far into Naxx but AQ40 and Naxx are not = to LFR.  MC certainly could be thought of as that easy.  The hard part of MC is not having 1 of the 40 people just completely fuckup with pulling adds or not understanding the very simple mechanics.
---
Gnome girls 4 life
---
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and it best if you play with people who hold the same views. I don't need to call you a try hard because of your opinion. 
---
Other than the main tank getting Thunderfury first which I'm not even going to argue against. My opinion 
---
is everyone shows up week after week for a crack at fat loot, they earn it with their commitment not the class they play. I hate loot councils for the mentality you have, if someone has the DKP or they have been holding off on gear for weeks to stay on top of the suicide kings ladder they deserve it.
---
Good video. I lol'd decent.
---
Because it's supply and demand. This is literally what is happening on my server as we speak. The MT of my guild is getting paid 15-20g to run PUGS through level 45+ dungeons PLUS rolls. He would never do it for only the items no one wants.
---
The repair guy isn't supposed to be there yet
---
Honestly the only person in the wrong here is you, why would you join an RP server with no intentions of RPing and act surprised when people don't like it?
---
&lt;Murloc Sushi&gt; alliance guild
---
&lt;Saurfang Adoration Club&gt; horde guild
---
Ok dude, I just got 40 and I'm like 57g away from my mount and I've been saving since the beginning. Are you offering services in the goldshire inn?
---
Anyways congrats on the milestone and welcome to wow!
---
My schedule is all over the place   Hard to consistently group with someone

People with plenty of gold looking to powerlevel alts/lower level guildies.

Not sure why wanting my game to resemble life makes me a ninja looter but okay...
---
Also your point is pants on head moronic. 
---
My point is ninja looting is actually part of what made this game so God damn great. People being unpredictable and shitty
---
This happened to me, I'm that priest that gets /who after 12am and get constant whispers.
---
them: UBRS?
---
me: can we do a jed run?
---
them: I don't need jed.
---
me: but I do. 
---
them: we aren't doing jed
---
me: I'm not doing UBRS.
---
Dont have the numbers so id love someone to correct me with some math but crusader is pretty good so i doubt it
---
This was rare in vanilla. I don't remember it ever happening to me. I remember we had DKP for raids, but that's completely different. That really was a merit based system that had issues. (For example, people built up unreasonable amounts of DKP from being in the guild and doing what was essentially trash content from early on. And if you joined that guild later, you were screwed on new content.)
---
Improvise! Adapt! 
---
Lol
---
Yes.
---
Had this exact issue aswell but only in Hinterlands. Relogging fixed it.
---
It's nice to finally meet my crossfaction me.
---
Heigan dance and 4 horsemen are not equivalent to LFR.
---
LFR might have more mechanics but you can fucking ignore them and win the fight.   Try that on heigan dance.   I didn't play Legion/BFA but LFR before that point was certainly faceroll and ignore the mechanics.
---
I had a priest that was beyond impatient in my group, we were doing ST and almost done, just had 2 bosses left. super smooth, no deaths, no issues. when we get to the dragonkin, he tells us we should let (me) the mage do big aoe pulls. The tank wasn't wanting to do it but said he's down. I'm not to keen on it, id rather just do a nice slow pulls, we were doing it this entire time. been in the dungeon maybe 35-40mins. about to be done. We decide to do 2 pulls. First Pull grabbed maybe almost 10 mobs. I AOE them down, gets a little hairy, near deaths. But all good. I'm oom, I sit and drink, tank waits. the Priest says "For real?" we don't think anything of it, do another big pull. Same thing. after im oom, sit and drink. The priest says "I'm out" and leaves group, hearths. After whispering him, trying to understand he said "Tank is to slow, he's waiting after every pull" The priest was super impatient, left us at end of dungeon. Luckily found a new priest who was super cool, and even joined our guild. so it worked out. 
---
TLDR: Priest wanted big pulls from mage, tank did just that. after 2 pulls left because was taking to long for mage to get mana, blamed tank for waiting on mage to drink.
---
At that level most classes die to 2 mobs. I dont play locj, but i wouldnt be surprised
---
So you're the fucker that won't let me finish that quest
---
There should be no reserve loot if you're gonna pug, imo.
---
the time of day matters too, I always go with the 24 hour cycle because most things I list are right before I log off in the morning on US TZ servers and the majority of buying won't be happening until 4-5 PM that night.
---
Not possible (in most cases) to make smart macros like this which make decisions for you.

Hi, /u/troe_uhwai_account
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/da92ih/anyone_else_get_disconnected_and_not_able_to_sign/). 
---
Yeah, but no one would message them if that was their pitch. Why would I do UBRS as a tank if I can't get my shield of my chest?
---
thats a very nice gesture :)
---
so then +magic damage is just significantly better for affliction (but really any circumstances) since immolate does fire damage?
---
Hope you get that promotion
---
Crusaders in EPL/WPL, furbolgs in Winterspring, or demons in Felwood.  
---
The furbolgs have a bonus of dropping firewater, which people will want for raiding, and the demons have a bonus of dropping felcloth.
---
Just flag yourself all of the time. People will play along!
---
Back now though
---
Agreed. The content rollout for PvP leaves a lot to be desired. We're waiting too long for BGs and DKs are still in the game. Ironic because DKs hurt world PvP a lot.
---
What will end up happening is people will just abandon leveling in zones and grind in instances because it'll be way more efficient than having to worry about getting ganked by a full group of people farming honor.
---
Good thing I didn't say that, ya know? Like how I explicitly stated it wasn't the **sole** reason. Classes are significantly stronger in 1.12 than they were when this content was brand new. Period. This is not subjective. Quit stroking your egos kids.
---
3.5mm is the standard"aux cord" plug size.
---
Or find a leveling guild!
---
That's not for you to decide.
---
Any reserved loot is bullshit. The only exception I'd look past is for legendaries IF it's a substantial amount of guild members. If its 50/50 guild/pug, that guild can eat a dick, 20 other people are working to clear the raid. If you backfill 1-5 people, fine they get no legendaries.
---
Holy shit. Best laugh of the day.
---
Lived in an area with a lot of Russians/Ukrainians. We always just assumed they were Russian. Anytime they overheard, they‚Äôd make sure to correct us (with an accent) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Lussian, I‚Äôm Uklanian‚Äù.

Allo the good recipes are drops.

Plenty of loot in MC shouldn't be there if they really phased the loot.

Don‚Äôt take them into the group. So simple.

He's checking the current stance and cancling it before he casts the new shift, which is the same timing as using the /cancel command in the macro. Both work just as fluidly. No real downside to using one key vs two, especially with a proper modifier in there for shift or alt or something to differentiate forms he wishes to swap to.
---
Have done Arena -&gt; golemlord about 20 times for the trinket. The frickin leather pants dropper SEVEN times in a row. I am not joking.
---
Offhand weapons suffer a 20% damage penalty, along with the increased miss chance, so your +5 damage is going to be +4 at max. Crusader is the best option pretty much always.
---
dude thanks so much for the insight!
---
Furthermore it goes to show the complete lack of respect for the RP community, the RP servers and the people who enjoy that aspect of the game. 
---
Yes, you are the a$$hole here. This is the equivalent of coming into someone home and laughing at their decorations.
---
Just curious how many soul shards you guys roll with on you at most times? I usually make a healthstone and a pet and then make a couple to store and that‚Äôs it to save on bag space. I‚Äôm only level 23 with all 8 slot bags.
---
In phase 1, free action potion before they freeze you is the easiest win. Also spider belt. In phase 2, trinket. Try to scatter shot or trap them before they get close enough to nova you. With engi you have more options to delay them if you get stuck, like grenade or frost reflector.
---
Hah good luck with 2 people wrangling 38 players without voice comms and no prior knowledge of the fights.  I'd love to watch you try that.
---
One of the reasons LFR is easier than Vanilla Naxx is precisely that you don't have 40 players.   Wrangling 10 or 25 players is much easier than 40 players.  That's the whole reason they stopped making 40man raids.
---
I'm a huge fan of old school machinimas like Myndflame, WoWCrendor, and Oxhorn's content for example, and my friends and I aim to bring back some of that Classic vibe from the olden days, but with out own unique voice and style.
---
After over a month of editing, I can finally say that this project is complete (with two more episodes hopefully coming soon). This video is more a TV show episode than a regular gaming video. It aims to parody sitcoms, noir films, John Wick, and Quentin Tarantino (especially Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction) while also being its own unique and entertaining piece.
---
This took forever to make and I put a LOT of work into it. I'd love it if you guys gave it a watch, or shared it with someone who would be interested! 
---
As with all art, sometimes it is portrayed differently than the author intended, so let me know what you thought of the video! As it's a parody in some ways, you may notice an excessive use of laugh tracks, even in very serious moments. This is all intentional, as I'm making fun of the use of laugh tracks in the first place. Let me know if I went overboard with that, or anything else! Were the John Wick references clear? Was the intro too long? Did you like the obnoxious, eardrum breaking screeching of the intro? (again, some parts are intentionally bad, but I hope I didn't go overboard since it still is intended as a high quality and hopefully enjoyable video)
---
This video took a ton of effort to make so I really hope you guys appreciate it!
---
I'd love any feedback from you guys in the comments cause all feedback helps me improve in future videos. The best ways you guys could help me is by watching and giving feedback as well as sharing with people you know would be interested!

Edit: the new thumbnail isn't update on Reddit despite having been the new thumbnail since yesterday. If it doesn't update on this post by tomorrow I'll delete this and repost cause currently this post is showing an old black and white thumbnail that I ended up abandonning.

The weapon on the left is doing 74-92 damage per swing, average of 83 damage, at 3.1 second swing speed, that is 26.8 dps.
---
The weapon on the right is doing 66-84 damage per swing, average of 75 damage, at 2.3 second swing speed, that is 32.6 dps.
---
Weapon swing speed matters a ton for damage per swing.
---
Do note: instant attacks have their own calculations.

Played on Gehennas-EU up to lvl 41 on my first character and got ganked quite often in contested areas without ever ganking anyone myself, got kinda fed up with it but a little ganking is to be expected. Then when i started questing in STV and got ganked so much by either groups of enemies or players much higher lvl than myself i started really disliking questing, spent nearly 3 hours one evening trying to do Bloodsail quests without finishing a single one due to corpse camping and ganking by so many different horde players i just gave up for the night. So i do some scarlet monastery and get ganked 3 times every time i try and enter the dungeon but i persist and get high enough lvl to get to Tanaris, i pick up some quests and go on my merry way to pirate cove or whatever is called and the moment i coem through the cave tunnel a group of 5 hordes higher lvl than me as well rush over to me and kill me in a flash then start spamming "go to retail" and other toxic stuff.
---
Thats when i decided to give up, if youre a horde on an imbalanced server and gank every alliance player you see even if they are not out there hurting anyone just to be an asshole (some people enjoy this feeling apparantly??) a lot of people like myself will resent playing on your server and will eventually leave. 
---
My loss is my lvl 41 character ive put time and effort into, the hordes loss is eventually ending up playing on a 90+% horde server so yeah, have fun with that.
---
World PvP can be exciting and engaging in the right circumstances, ganging up on lone players is being as ass, ganking people 10 lvls lower than yourself is being an ass, attacking someone on 20% hp fighting a mob is being an ass. 
---
5 hordes coming to an elite mob quest spawn and seeing 5 alliance there waiting and fighting for the right to kill the mob first is fun, 1v1 vs an enemy you encounter running from A to B on full health is fun, or just fair fights in general is fun and engaging world pvp.
---
Believe it or not, playing on a pvp server without being an asshole to players of the enemy faction is actually possible and just because i chose to play on a pvp server does not mean i signed up to be a rag-doll punching bag.
---
I no longer assume Russian.
---
THe thing about reserving or locking any items is that it has to still be fair. If a tank doesnt need any items from strat living and has pretty good gear it is fine to lock all orbs as long as you are somebody probably below level 60 that still needs a lot of quests and gear from the dungeon. Most hilarious thing I saw on a p-server was 2 dds locking hoj but were still looking for a tank and a healer. Like guys you have to accept the possibility that you might not get your piece of loot the first time it drops. Locking stuff usually means you have some right also the other person still gets stuff. Locking can be a very functional compromise to enable easier group finding but most of the time people are being completely unreasonable without any gear or skill to back it up.
---
I mean, your reply insinuates that I'm crying or something.
---
I saw an event take place that was wildly put of the ordinary, coincidence? Highly likely.  Was just bringing it up in case someone else saw something.
---
What‚Äôs a half rend run? Stop at rend? Only 5 people?
---
That was really good. Subbed. Keep em coming.
---
Ahh I love our own WOW stories.
---
(X)Doubt
---
Can someone explain what layer exploiting does?
---
I get pings daily as a druid to tank or heal. Good thing I can do both. Lack of dungeon group will never be an issue with you as a druid.
---
&lt;Onyxia Gives Epic head&gt; Was on Dreadmist EU alliance side.
---
But someone reported it
---
It def can be any of those things,  but was just bringing it up in case it was a known thing.  Thanks though.
---
Like a lot of people are saying, it depends. I think a majority guild run should be able to reserve some items. But I think they should avoid inviting people who need what is being reserved. In this instance, it's stupid. Because what kind of warrior is going to main tank UBRS without a chance for the shield or the chest? You're not going to find one right now.
---
Exactly.  LFR you don't even have to know the mechanics most of the time.  Try not knowing Naxx mechanics against Heigan or 4 horseman.  If you know it it's not hard except to get 40 people correctly geared into it.  But if you queued for it like LFR there's no way you'd beat the few bosses that do require precise mechanics.
---
I probably spent 20g buying every blue BoE bow before 40 while leveling my hunter. Still had over 100g well before hitting 40.
---
I always get the "I buy it (a price atleat 20-30% below what I ask for) k?" and if I decline they get mad and start insulting me and sometimes they to spam trade with my item for a "lower price", people are trash lol.
---
Dps * swing speed = average damage per swing.
---
How does a swing speed not affect damage?
---
That worked, thanks
---
Ashenvale/Duskwood best bet, but finish of Wetlands later is my recommendation, as at around 29 you will hit a really bad spot where it looks like there is no good area to level (this torture goes until 32-33 after which STV becomes more accessible).
---
30-35g an hour is really good. thats what locks and hunters soloing mara get. people just exaggerate their gp/h, no one is getting 50g/hr in mara without ring selling
---
bit "orcward" where one of the orcs arms are...
---
Yeah I'm a little disappointed my fave BG, AB is what phase 4?
---
But I'm having a fling blast.
---
It's everyone forgetting they are releasing it this way because that's what the community wanted.... And what P servers do...
---
Circle of Jerks
---
Succubus actually can be way more valuable soloing and in dungeons depending on need.
---
Void walker honestly sucks due to it‚Äôs inability to hold agro.
---
The imp is nice fo dungeons do to bloodpact helping the tabk.
---
The felhunter is great in dungeons against caster bosses or when you need to dispel magic debuffs on yourself or a party member.
---
Honestly If you are on a pvp server, keep the succubus out as it is fantastic at saving your ass when someone tried to jump you! (Especially rogues and warriors.)
---
Tried playing on my huge 4ktv and just couldn't get comfortable. I need that desk chair and a reasonably sized monitor.
---
Classic WoW is still crazy populated, I don't think they'll be able to remove layering without just plowing 12k people most of which are still 10-30. It's been fine though, unlike scaremonger mcgee there.
---
Holy fuck, gratz dude!:D
---
Would probably violate reddit wide rules on witch hunts
---
I still think it tends toward being true. It's largely the class for people who are willing to fill any voids. And you don't get any of the edge lord races like undead, orc, or gnome.
---
As a warrior and tank player I do get whispers all the time and I never have to wait if i were looking for a group. There is a drought and there has always been a drought.
---
They made a mistake by giving him a warning. They reversed the mistake by removing the warning. You're still wrong, buddy.
---
Some of the best paladins are actually JUST figuring out precisely how to play spellpower ret.  Check out Judgement's stream or the podcast on Countdownforclassic.  These guys played Vanilla and Private servers and are still discovering the best way to play their favorite class.
---
i like to think they turn into my pet and i control them now ;)
---
That makes a ton of sense now. Thank you for this!
---
Ok, I'll rephrase.
---
This staff is shitty. Though if I had to give it to one or the other based on who it would benefit most, I would give it to the lock. 
---
Why?
---
Stamina translates directly into mana for a lock.
---
Locks already stack stam,  making an extra 30 significant.
---
30 extra stam on a mage makes them slightly harder to two shot. Not saying it still cant be done, just that 300 hp is 300 hp. 
---
It has a skull on it.
---
There.
---
The difference is no one is working for no reward if you just avoid people who want your gear. That's a huge difference, man. 
---
When I run SM on my warrior, I tank. I tend to avoid hunters and shamans. I recognize that they want the mail gear I want for when they're fresh 40, so I don't invite them. I'm not inviting them and saying, "listen, the whole reason you're here? that's mine."
---
That's what horde do.
---
&gt;Queues are practically gone for most servers
---
The three biggest servers in NA still have queues, but that's not really the best metric to go by. The amount of unique players per week would be better, but idk whether blizzard will post any stats regarding player-base.
---
Back in vanilla I leveled my hunter pretty fast and it was really hard to find groups because the level 60 pop was 4 out of 10 hunters. So i rerolled a priest and leveled with a warrior. It was a lot of fun and we had no problems finding groups obviously. By the time the priest was 60 I could go back to the hunter and run dungeons and raid, but I had the priest as backup if I couldn‚Äôt find a healer and still wanted to play.
---
Lmao I love that you knew what it was.
---
Isn't it due to damage calculation from attack power, less damage per hit, more damage per second?
---
I solo quest with succubus all the time in pvp intensive areas, you‚Äôll probably have a little more downtime for eating/drinking but you should be killing a little faster too
---
For your first question, your buffs go through right as the MC gets interrupted by you casting, so the buff would stick to them even though you can‚Äôt see it without a mage‚Äôs detect magic. 
---
For your second question, MCing the Tauren would cause the mobs to drop combat since they‚Äôre friendly to you. If they were neutral or aggressive, they‚Äôd continue hitting the Tauren until the mc ends and then would swap to you.
---
The funny thing is even as a warrior I know that druids are the best tanks at the beginning especially for dungeons. Dont let them tell you anything bears are OP.
---
At level 20 you should have gotten a 12slot bago for soul shards, and a 16 slot at level 30. I always try to have all but 1 slot of the soul bag filled.
---
Did this a couple weeks ago on a 4K tv, my mouse lag was BAD. Learned how to create really efficient keybinds as a result. Good experiment but not comfortable for me.
---
No idea my Samsung has a game mode and it always makes everything how it should be
---
im sure people are leaving but i rarely see low pop servers unless its middle of the day
---
If you are primarily affliction I would totally go for +shadow while leveling since you have very few fire spells.
---
Now end game you may want to stick to plus +magic so your fire spells get a boost as well.
---
Getting a fat soul fire crit on that pleb something magical!
---
Holy shit what a sad way to play the game.   I look forward to shitting on your cereal eaters in PvP.
---
Just join a guild that doesn't enforce a meta then.
---
Genuinely asking, why would you want to immediately feral charge?
---
Blizz wants money I guess. What really blows my mind is how most of the playerbase seems fine with it.

If I‚Äôm walking for a while I use num lock to auto walk and turn with right click. You can also enjoy the scenery with left click in auto walk mode. For kiting nothing beats wasd movement. But I occasionally use right click movement as well, typically for walking short distances.
---
Imo tank loot is for both tanks, but the dal rends I understand tbh
---
Yeah makes sense, personally I love PvP so I can‚Äôt wait to just hop into BGs. Wish it was in the game now but I understand why it isn‚Äôt.
---
Not great metrics... At launch many people play every night and even falsely stay active while afk to skip queues, generating long queues. Not reality, but the exact same number of active users could continue to play ~three nights a week, which is probably a more realistic long term definition of an active user, and queues could drastically shorten without the number of ‚Äúactive users‚Äù changing at all.
---
need a weakauras one for rogues too
---
R1 frostbolt isnt just for pvp. Sure it‚Äôs more useful. But 1-1.5 second cast slow is huge in dungeons and in the world to a lesser extent.
---
Would you consider it ninja looting or bad form to need roll on Whitemane's Chapeau (level 29 to wear) as a level 35 druid when you have a level 40 priest in your party?
---
I would like to come back and say that your mom is disgusting. But I am not going to do that because you probably dont know any better. 
---
PS I'm sure your mom is a wonderful lady.
---
but if +magic affects both fire and shadow damage isn't it just inherently better? what am i missing here?
---
Yes, but most games give you 5ups an hour early...ofcourse that has to be tuned down heavily
---
Wow classic starts out pretty slow
---
‚ÄúIf you want me to MT this dungeon, I‚Äôm gonna need 50g for every piece of loot that I can‚Äôt roll on. You have until my hearthstone is finished casting to make your decision.‚Äù
---
This thread is a list of ninja looters trying to justify ninja looting. Makes me sick to know I am gonna have to group with people who don't understand NEED over GREED. Gold = greed.

When I was a kid my dad paid for. Yesterday I got mine fresh at 40 with 20 gold left over. Felt great!
---
How do you record in game footage ?
---
Hilarious, absolute madlads. The worst part is that they tried to sweep it under the rug by stating it INSIDE the instance. Makes anyone who bothered making their way there less inclined to leave. Noble attempt at doing something scummy. I'm happy they exposed themselves.
---
On the flipside, I see too many DPS whine when they don't like the reservations made. If a Tank makes a Strat UD group and reserves the mount, people should learn to either stfu or make their own group. In Strat UD there's pretty much no loot for Tanks while there's multiple Pre-Raid BiS pieces for other classes in there.

Is it not from the extra strength on the right?
---
I tell healers not ot heal me lol
---
And what if one person rolls greed and the rest hold out?
---
Dammit, I see it now. Carry on. I'm going to go work on my Leatherworking now :(
---
Well I mean if the MT has absolutely no chance of getting any loot out of a run, I totally understand them wanting *something* for their time.

I can't say for certain is a great area, but Tyr's Hand atleast two chest spawn locations (I know one in my blacksmith, and one at the back outside of the church) and the elites in the north part of WPL have one in the tower leading up and  another somewhere with the area there. Might be worth checking out both those spots? No idea what the spawn rate is like though, for all I know it could be 8 hours!
---
I'm playing a frost mage. I've never played WoW before in my life, and I looked up the talent tree from Infra and I'm having a great time copying it. It's reassuring knowing I'm being efficient with the tree, and that I'll eventually be beasty.
---
Some people think "playing your own way" is how you should play, but I enjoy copying someone who's figured it out. I don't think there's a right way to play. If someone is having fun... then there ya go. 
---
So, I guess I'm playing a cookie cutter build meta character lol
---
Did you change your video display settings to 60 hz it‚Äôs probably default set to 30 I know mine was all laggy before a friend told me about him having the same problem
---
And this should be said BEFORE you get summoned
---
Karma is a bitch. Better stay cool.
---
Why reaction is exactly why. Oh no a pet you wanted got killed and now you are posting it on reddit??? How dare they! It‚Äôs almost as if the opposite faction is the enemy.
---
A butt sex joke after bitching that you aren't getting your way? Do you try to be childish? You seem very practiced at it.
---
Some of us can make educated assumptions, like 30 days not being long enough for everyone to hit 60, but 60 days being long enough for people to realise if they want to make it to 60 or not.
---
Would also like to know which addon can do this.
---
Appreciate it friend
---
Welcome to what you knew before you decided to play.
---
It‚Äôs a quick way of saying you‚Äôre forming a particular group composition. Depending on the dungeon in question spellcleave is normally 4 mages and a priest, but some dungeons work better by having one of the mages replaced by a tank or warlock for the purpose of gathering mobs which the mages will then AoE using improved Blizzard and a nova rotation for maximum control of the mobs.
---
I did several ZF GY spellcleave runs last night and didn‚Äôt run into any issues except for our last run which was pretty late so people were getting tired. Just like any cooperative game it all depends on who you play with. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs spellcleave, meleecleave or a more traditional group composition. If you have inexperienced or idiot players in your group you‚Äôre going to run into issues.
---
Guild of ninjas confirmed. Their greed over anyones need. Have fun in MC and beyond. If they can't pass BIS to someone who clearly needs it your guild is doomed once they get any real loot on the table.
---
It will depend on your fire to shadow damage ratio. Also shadow specific items will often have more bonus than a magic item
---
No I didn‚Äôt adjust anything with the flicker rate. My issue was no matter how fast I set the mouse speed, it was too slow and couldn‚Äôt cover as many pixels as I need it to. It was a $9 garbage wireless mouse and keyboard.
---
How short does your run distance need to be that the mount summoning time isn't worth it?   
---
Is AH to bank in org worth mounting for?
---
I'm not 100% sure I fully understand it, BUT...
---
There's a thing in Vanilla called the 3.5s rule for spell power. It means something like this:
---
    (Spell's Cast time) / 3.5 = actual spell power boost
---
    Example:
---
    (Shadow Bolt Cast time) / 3.5 = actual spell power boost
---
    (3 / 3.5) = 86%
---
What this means is that your shadow bolt only increases it's damage by 86% of your spell power. However, items that are +school.of.magic ignore this rule. So an item that's +magic just increases your overall spell power and is part of the 3.5s rule. But an item that is +shadow is a specific school of magic and therefore *ignores* the 3.5 second rule when being factored into your damage.
---
Being decked out all in +shadow gear means your shadow spells are benefiting 100% from your spell power.
---
As an aside, I also believe spell power coefficient (the 3.5s rule) is determined BEFORE talents are taken into account, so insta-cast spells aren't necessarily a 0% coefficient.  Honestly, I don't know how the rule applies to dots, but the overall answer you wanted is in here.
---
The benefits of being married 10 years is WoW classic makes zero dent in your sex life, lol
---
Youre a fool dude. Mages are best at everything? Youve never played vanilla i guess. Warriors, rogues and mages all fight for top dps and mages dont even come close til bwl. Also mages are being beaten by wars rogues and hunters atm as per the logs by wowhead. They cant heal, and they are good at 1v1 but doesnt make them the best considering rogues can beat every class. So if they arent the best dps, 1v1ers, and healers then they arent the best at everything dipshit. Learn to pvp and maybe youll stop hating on classes you are too bad to fight
---
The first time I saw this was in 2005, a war on Tich was farming Ironfoe. He found his own healer and a good dps and opened the other two slots to any dps, but always advertised in spam that if Ironfoe dropped that it was going to the war. 
---
This was before the need before greed rolling system was even patched in, so the threat of anyone picking it up off the corpse was still very real.
---
You only really need a few people that know what they‚Äôre doing to kill MC bosses. 1 person isn‚Äôt gonna wipe you on almost every boss.
---
Aside from the dungeon journal which lists mechanics how do you think people on retail do it on new raid releases? Just like you said. 
---
"Hey idiots, dodge this, move here. Collect loot". 
---
Same thing in naxx. 
---
"Hey idiots, dodge this, taunt that" 
---
I dont care if its 40 players or 400 as long as you can herd cats the mechanical difficulties are the same. Comms or no comms.

You wanted to rush through, finish everything that first month and be done?  I would be very upset if they rushed phases, they didn't put unarmored mount in because they don't want people to rush and im enjoying the leveling the way it is.  If they announced phase 2 about to drop I would then feel rushed to catch up.  I get that you want the retail experience, that's cool and too each their own.  I want the places to be slow and have a mass of casual guilds working the content before the next phase drops.  Not 100% but at least a 50% participation in raids happening before they drop another phase.  When honour comes in and the majority of the pack that is still 40's to 50 start getting obliterated in the world when trying to make that last push would be detrimental to their play experience I feel.  Could also be cool with a lot of community support to help but then you'd feel like you need to hire bodyguards if you want to quest.
---
&gt; I forgot to turn it off when we zoned in
---
This makes me think that they didn't kill the mob by themselves.
---
Ok ok I was good until dj Khaled haha
---
important thing to note, with backstab and sinister strike you want to look for the slower daggers for your main hand as when comparing 2 daggers of the same dps, the slower means higher top end damage which means bigger backstabs.
---
If they are marked civilian, IIRC.
---
do you have a bigger discount if revered ?
---
He should stick to retail. He's been spoon fed, didn't care to pay attention about Classic, and now he's crying.

Fellow Goon on Incendius

Ahh I have no idea mine is like 21k dpi or something high
---
For one, why would you want a fantasy game of elves, undead, and orcs who have magical powers to "resemble real life"? I deal with enough shitty people in real life I don't need it in my down time.
---
&gt; My point is ninja looting is actually part of what made this game so God damn great. People being unpredictable and shitty
---
No it did not. Jesus christ did you even play vanilla? I did, a lot. Everybody hated ninja looters and they were blacklisted and ignored by everyone who came across them. I ran every single dungeon and raid I was in as the master looter because I knew I'd be fair and I was tired of bullshit ninjas... not only that I would have people waiting for me to run them every day because I ran them well and they knew if they won the roll they got the item. Even if I wanted it, I still forked it over.
---
The mental gymnastics people do because they can't just admit they're selfish pricks is astounding.
---
WoW launched without all of that...
---
If you barely have 100g after leveling skills at 60 you are doing something *terribly* wrong.
---
[Nice! If you like big recklessness crits you might want to check this out.](https://youtu.be/z_d2osCrIYU?t=437)
---
Ahh yes so the people who have been playing for a month would just move to a new server, genius.
---
I was looking for this comment. There is literally no reason to play fire. Unless you reeeaaallly like blast wave, that's about it. Maybe he is referring to pom Pyro spec?
---
I'm gonna go with answer 3: Nobody outside Blizzard *really* knows how well classic is doing. There's just two groups of people reinforcing their own beliefs, without any data to back up their viewpoint.
---
I say first finish of the stuff you have in current zones. Get 31 if possible like that. After you can go Hillsbrad, couple of quests in Arathi and northern STV. After that go Desolace. At 33-34 you can do Shimmering flats. After that STV again until 36-37 when you can continue Arathi and Alterac Mountains. At 38+ you also have 5-6 quests in Badlands.
---
During all of this I recommend hitting at least a few runs of each SM instance. It will get you some  gear and XP to ease the levelling pains.
---
regular arms build. sweeping strikes + Whirlwind all you need.
---
you need to respec for raids tho
---
Youre a real detective, i wouldnt have guessed with his herb sticker on the case
---
No idea my mouse is like 21k dpi or something really high
---
&gt; /run SetSortBagsRightToLeft(true)
---
Thank you! I tried that and it seems to give me a lua error, even with all addons disabled. Does that usually happen?
---
Loot reservation groups have been out of control in general as well. I refuse to join a 5 man group where people are reserving gear.. even if it's something I don't need. I can only understand if it's a guild MC run or something and they absolutely advertise it as such.
---
How about a paladin tank?
---
I'm talking end-game dungeons (level 50+), but not necessarily raids. Am I going to be able to do this or nah?
---
You must be like 14 and retarded if you think that. Certainly you have not an inkling of knowledge of classic or wow in general
---
I commend you for having this type of mindset, a huge part of the game of classic (IMO) is that exploration you mentioned which just gets ruined by markers telling you where to go at all times
---
Oh you're talking a level 60 tanking low level dungeons? Eh if people want to be carried they can pay the going rate. 
---
I'm not paying a damn thing for someone my level, nor should anybody expect it.
---
Scarlett Monastery
---
My biggest temptation is to sap and just leave.
---
Not to me. It's ninja looting if you're not even going to use the gear. It's in poor taste to roll for alt-spec gear when a party member needs it as their main spec gear, but slightly less douchey than taking it to D/E or sell.
---
If you think its a buttsex joke, you are the childish one here.
---
all this post is circlejerking complaining about people reserving loot
---
Lmao I was gonna roast him on it but we all been there
---
I play Earthfury, I feel like it's well balanced. No complaints.
---
Same can be asked about orc warlocks and undead rogues. Bastards the whole lot of them. I aam just awaiting to hit 60 so that I can start revenge  ganking level 40 horde in arathil.
---
Op is a moron.
---
Ah yes the best way to raise your weapon skill alliance side.
---
If someone could articulate how their off meta spec is designed to work and can prove they understand how to play it then Im all about it. 
---
That being said most of their arguments are "I dunno I just like to be a moonkin lol!" 
---
That doesn't instill confidence at all. I don't even trust most players playing meta builds as far as I can throw them.
---
KFC gravy is fucking delicious.
---
I once dueled with a paladin for about 30 minutes (in vanilla). Neither lost or won, we just decided to call it.
---
That's how you know he's talking out of his ass. He's probably a ret paladin. I have bad news homie the gear check on Patchwerk and Loatheb is significant. People won't want ret paladins for it.
---
This is what I'm doing too but I hate having to move the board when I need to pee. Need to order me some catheters on amazon.
---
Due to the fact something like 60-80% of players don't have a max level toon yet, depending on server, the amount of money entering the economy is still very low. It will increase as more players have a level 60 character, where they can earn hundreds of gold with relative ease.
---
That's what I do, and my next toon is gonna be a warrior lol. I was torn between war and rogue but the lack of 60 tanks made my decision easy
---
All I can see is the peel away plastic on your monitors just begging to be peeled.
---
Bash is feeling left out
---
I play for both, but I am not here to rush content. The raids get challenging by the end of AQ40, by that time honestly if you're core group has D teir dps it's not the spec at that point. 
---
I think too often min maxers experience a bad player playing a bad spec and make this connection that all players playing that spec are bad. The dps might be lower but nothing at a point that will hold you back from seeing content.
---
Just had a question...So for an ability like lets say Overpower that says it does weapon damage +5. What weapon damage are we actually talking about there? Would that be the stat I've outlined in my image?
---
I laughed so necessarily hard while watching this video.... my sides hurt.  MORE VIDS PLS!!!
---
I carebeared around quite a bit giving away crafted goods to level my tailoring, so I imagine I've wasted a bit of change that way. But you know,  I don't even mind. People that i gave away bags to in that first week are still on my friend list and will invite me to dungeon groups and stuff. It's nice being nice.
---
So you'd agree its at least bad form then?
---
dragonbreath chili works
---
I'm lost.   Why am I performing mental gymnastics when I'm not a ninja?
---
You seem like a joke of a person. I assume all of your pride is wrapped up in your WoW gear
---
And retail is a giant cash shop. Blizzard fully admits they're raking in the money off the micro transactions.  Another reason I'm happy with Classic. $15 a month and I will be able to play all of Classic's content and obtain almost anything I want.
---
I didn‚Äôt save this comment to do later I promise
---
I‚Äôm not saying that it didn‚Äôt
---
I think it is a different killing someone in pvp or wpvp - or mess up someones day and effort for nothing.
---
But I see I think different here. Btw even on PvE server this could happen - also same faction could kill the monster! It isnt the opposite faction!
---
No. But elemental mages are good in their own way. 
---
If you're deep into frost, you'll only be using frost bolt and rarely if ever use any fire spell other than fire blast. 
---
So shatter increases the spell crit chance of any spell by 50% if the target is frozen. Works great with fire and arcane spells, but frost is the only tree that increases frost crit damage by 100%. Though fire has an overall danage output.
---
I doubt hit, but I do run around with 9% hit on gear and 5% from talents.
---
Listen he's obviously doing that so when he tokes that bowl he can blow it down and get his computer high too. Leave not a single brother behind.
---
That rogue was absolute trash.
---
huh turns out you had the shitty attitude the whole time what a twist
---
Literally every single thread with the words Vanilla and Raiding in it has this exact comment. Clearing MC is not more time consuming than any raid on retail. Guilds can actually do it in less than an hour. But most guilds actually can‚Äôt even clear it in a night because they suck at the trash and their wipe recovery sucks too. What would you call the difference between someone able to do the same task as you but 10 times faster?
---
Magic dust is for sure. I have a stack in my bag.
---
Threat isn't one player's responsibility it's a team effort. Just be a good communicator and you shouldn't have many problems
---
Both. You should be able to keep theat but it's difficult to get threat back off someone (as you need to get to 110% of their threat to rip it off them), so they should give you a sec and definitely not pull for you.

I think I kinda hit the nail on the head actually. I think you are too immature to offer anything of substance. I will not be replying anymore, have a good day.
---
If you are pvp flagged, civilians will be labeled as such.  And any kills of them will give you or anyone in your party a dishonorable kill.

Which means that people did grief in the past by inviting high ranked players and purposefully killing a civilian nearby.

I see these posts and it makes me feel bad. I literally ran to the spawn area, first spot I check there he is no one around. Took me all of 30 seconds. He's 20 levels below me though so I have to level him up üòí
---
Nah
---
How? Why?
---
People should play the way they want, and this includes the people who set rules on what specs are necessary for the raid. You can't have it both ways.
---
There are tons of guilds, and some of them will be very welcoming of every spec even if it is not meta for raids. **Stop trying to force everyone to conform to your style of gameplay.**
---
You misspelled delicious.

Everyone starts Hated with Bloodsail Buccaneers, they are a hostile faction. You can grind rep very slowly by killing the guards in Booty Bay if you are a masochist. This will very gradually raise your Bloodsail rep and tank your Steamwheedle Cartel reps. If you get to Exalted they give you a fancy captain's hat.
---
I love having a warrior dps. No gear competition and I feel safer knowing that they can take a beating if shit hits the fan.
---
The first two golem giants would never be allowed in LFR.
---
I'm stuck at 38 and taking a break. Glad someone has time to play and is enjoying it though!
---
Literally lol
---
Especially in a high pop Horde heavy server.
---
I'm pretty sure the 1 month mark was a major drop in players considering the amount of players that probably bought a month of game time just to check it out.
---
I've always played a warrior, the pally tanks were good in vanilla all you had to do was consecrate and stay alive. It was a long time ago though and I never played a pally as a primary character. The only downside is you have to roll alliance to play one unless they changed it.
---
You didn't read my comments. Why are you claiming things that aren't true?
---
Actually there's significant problems with the pservers.  Some of the best players are discovering that ferals and spellpowerdins are better in classic thent hey were on pservers.
---
Items will be interesting as pservers definitely got procrates wrong too.
---
Just saying there is more to figure out and some of the best at their classes are finding some of this stuff out right now.  Check Skarm for feral tanking, check Judgement for spelladin info.  These guys know their shit and they're still admitting to figuring out some of the differences from pserver to classic.
---
Frost Mage vs Warlock for solo leveling/questing?
---
Can confirm, I have a TSM operation that does exactly this.
---
Gaining threat is the tanks job. Not getting aggro is the dps and healers job.
---
Please do not stop making these
---
YOU ARE LIVING THE RIGHT LIFE.
---
I keep hoping that people will stop being so anal about stupid shit.  Unfortunately so many people seem to be extremely slow learners.  Have to almost spell it out in crayon and repeat it over and over again.
---
**Vanilla is not hard.  Vanilla is not hard.  Vanilla is not hard.**
---
This content can be done undermanned and in a pug.  This content is old and was mastered many years ago.  You can literally beat this stuff wearing green shit using a leveling spec.  There is absolutely no reason to min/max.  In fact I don't think I could even stand to be in a 40 man raid where everyone was being a try-hard.  I mean it's kinda boring as it is doing it undermanned.  Going all out would make the biggest challenge not falling asleep.
---
So for all you future raid leaders out here.  Relax.  This shit is easy.  Just invite whoever wants to come and don't worry about much else.
---
i tried to take it slow and not rush to 60 but my 1.12 power was too much for the weak little mobs really i tried but they just kept feeding me xp and now mc on farm and we just farming free epics
---
Everyone needs to tune their rotations for dungeons differently to how they would for levelling. A priest might use Mind Blast solo but shouldn‚Äôt in a dungeon party because of the threat spike unless they really know what they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs a team effort. Same with healing. Just because you‚Äôve got a healer doesn‚Äôt mean you can ignore taking damage as a DPS. Too many DPS thinks that in dungeon runs they just do their normal rotations but don‚Äôt need to worry about mobs.
---
&gt; I guess just everyone in the world understands how to make money better than me. 
---
Tip number one to make money: level up. You'll make so much more money with higher level items and you'll also make money while leveling up.
---
Oh and if you're on the AH, make sure you cap your minimum prices with the vendor prices and the AH cut in mind. And don't insist on listing something that isn't selling, deposit fees are a big deal when you don't have gold to begin with.
---
goes to shamans before druids
---
Ah. Well, I plan to get very deep into Frost. If you catch my drift.
---
Xxrougeassassinxx's ambush crits you for 3x your total health. You die.
---
I really wish classic had an outfit designer that allowed you to pick a look and use it even if you pick up different Armor
---
I laughed hard
---
If the character dies while having his soul drained, he permanently dies. The player has to create a new character and start over.
---
Have had lots of positive experiences in classic, but people still suck sometimes!
---
Yeah the time you spend doing that probably wouldn't be much less than just looking for it
---
Respect for the Tim Hortons Hockey cup, I have it in black :)

Yeah just 4 people randomly hating on you for NO REASON

What a random mystery

I mean you didnt offer anything of substance, so maybe do some self reflecting before just trying to dismiss someone as immature. Saying "You are entitled" doesnt bring anything to a discussion.

Your role in every dungeon is being the second best aoe monkey after the mage, even though you do half his damage and offer zero utility

It is a lot of fun. When I was first sent to thunderbluff. I read it was in the north of Kilgore, so I thought I could go there from the stone talon mountain entrance. I was dead wrong and I learned it the hard way. But it was a lot of fun nonetheless.
---
melee cleave is just too fun as a priest. Very fun to heal, very fast leveling, and I made SO many friends advancing through SM and ZF with various warriors and shamans, farming for hours. Would recommend.
---
You can still get it. You're not locked to any one mount, you're able to buy as many as you can fit in your inventory. So whenever you get exalted you can go back and buy your tiger.

Yea, every reputation level adds to it.

I love these kinds of posts though. It's like a mystery we have to solve as a team.

Grouping will increase your kill speed meaning you will have more chances at the random drop in less time.  It is still optimal to group for random drop quests.
---
It is known.
---
Do people seriously beg for gold? Just...play the game. There's plenty of gold to be had by farming mobs, selling gathered mats, running quests, etc.
---
I responded to your other comment in this chain. It took a few minutes to do all the math and write it down, but TL;DR, the weapon on the right that looks like it does less damage will hit slightly harder for overpowers.
---
Warrior DPS is top tier.
---
I'm assuming you're not very bright..
---
Because you just contradicted yourself in your two statements there.  I'll let you work it out
---
Underrated comment
---
No one is arguing that you should cast fire spells against immune monsters.  Just that if someone specs fire for pvp they can still come and contribute with frost spells because who cares if they're doing half the dps you can clear MC with 20 people.  So your 40th guy is fire spec who fucking cares.
---
But no I'm not taking someone who is literally doing 0 dps.  Idc if they are afk or if they are casting fire spells against immune monsters.  It'd be better to have 39 people at that point.
---
Easy solution is to just transfer off. If any of you are concerned about not being able to play, imagine how bad it'll be when layering is removed and honor is added.
---
Servers can already hold far more people than they used to, imagine trying to do ANYTHING with 5k+ of the opposite faction roaming the world, infesting every nook and cranny, not a single millimeter will be unused. But oh, "no changes". Phase two is going to be an absolute shitshow. 
---
That's okay though, I knew what to expect and rolled PVE, so I can wait.  I know "we're" all still hot off the #nochanges bullshit, but when you guys get fed up with the state of the game here in a couple months, I'll be here to bitch with the rest of you. 
---
Have fun with the corpse runs, mate.
---
Cries in plate armor... i had 20 gold at lvl 40 and tank repair bills were 75 silver per uldaman run and each warrior skill is 3 gold rip

managed to get my mount at 45 tho

Mom.. mom... Bathroom!!!

I was talking about eating trash?
---
Go read patch notes, content wasn‚Äôt hard, it wasn‚Äôt massively nerfed, you‚Äôre nothing special if you did the content in vanilla.  Stop living in the past old man!
---
Managing threat is everyone's job.
---
Holy shit you got so retardedly pissed off for no reason.  The guy is trying to clarify why you think someone doing 0 dps is the same as someone playing a spec they want to.  You couldn't contribute a valid point and now are resulting to insults.  How sad.
---
In Pugs it's essential to get in over the other guy. IMHO.
---
You *lost it* because you recognised the Bloons dart sound effect was used? Fuck, your sense of humour must be as dry as a desert.
---
Which realm are you on? That name and guild are ringing bells.
---
in this situation charging, which gets you in melee and gives rage, punishes you to use your stun
---
no other class has that problem
---
that isnt a problem with ordering your spells, that's a problem with game design, **and as proof of that they do fix this in later versions of the game**
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
Do more of this.. i like this

Cendillius the gnome never saw it coming, as he was pondering life's gmeaning.

---
So first of all, he said it wasn't ninja looting, so I followed up with asking if he thought it was bad form, meaning bad etiquette/courtesy. There is a difference between something seen as egregiously bad and just impolite behavior.   
---
Secondly, the druid isn't going to equipping it for 4 more levels and is able to continue running the instance until he gets to a level where he can wear the item. He also isn't about to equipping it right away as a party member would who be putting it on right away as the party continued to run the dungeon.
---
I agree, I did the mistake of not informing a PUG member that I had reserved a piece of loot that he wanted. Ultimately let him /roll and he won, so I gave it to him. If a Raid leader/Group leader fails to do so, he should be held accountable. Either be treated as a Ninja or bite the bullet and be fair with letting the PUG member /roll
---
Tanaris is a solid start at 43, you can take it all the way to 50 and them hop into un'goro after.
---
remember my dad ranting about lightforge tauren running around in 2006 that some day they will make taurens paladins and every race a paladin and how it's gonna make uther roll in his tomb
---
I agree.
---
Then ask your parents one question:
---
When they are gone, are they teaching your brother, let alone any other family member, how to deal with his condition?
---
He will never have an epiphany because he‚Äôs literally Eric Cartman playing wow.
---
Does that expand the quest tracker bar in the right side? I am using questie and I can only track 5 quests at a time.
---
Me and my friend run around PvPing a lot and he always says "I just dont fuck with warlocks, it's not worth it."
---
Unless you actually want to use your abilities and be decent at least, then you ignore the above and definitely use more than just Fire Blast.
---
Scotch is extremely handy in both pvp and PvE, especially considering some mobs levelling are immune to Frost for example, or when another mage uses Frost ward, or when you want to cast something quick to finish them off, or if you're playing impact+ignite/Frost. Not to mention rank 1 Fireball for keeping rogues out of stealth.
---
No, I most certainly did not. But I'll let you work it out.

So what? The quest was done.

Delete this part its cringe

/played is broken, once you get past like 10 days it just keeps adding extra time.  wake up, log in, log off, go to bed,  +20 hours even though u only played like 2
---
I'm so damn torn between Warlock and Rogue as my main. I really like Warlocks but Rogue just looks so damn cool with big swords and more meaningful weapon upgrades and a slightly more demanding PvE rotation. I do like being a caster though, and knowing that as a lock I'll be really strong in PvP in later patches is super enticing. My lock is 37 and my rogue is 33. I need to stick to one but I just can't make up my mind. All help is appreciated!
---
I saw this happen to a orc warrior today.. I waved.. Got on boat... And feared him into fatigue zone.
---
Sorry friend. Red is dead. &lt;3
---
Blizzard has the proof and they've made a decision. You can stop being purposely wrong now, thx.
---
It's not an argument. I asked you to explain how you can be certain of these numbers and you aren't able to. You know why? Because you don't have any data, just random numbers you pull out of your ass.
---
We could argue if you really want to though.
---
If your warrior is geared out enough shields are completely unnecessary. Nothing wrong with druid tanks but don't shit on warriors because you've played with a couple bad ones. Threat generation and damage output is on a whole nother level for 2H or dual wield tanks. Top threat and top damage. It's gg.
---
Harder? No. It's REALLY not harder.
---
The problem is that there's a LOT of retarded DPS players that WILL NOT WAIT for you to establish solid threat.
---
If you get good DPS that understands threat, tanking is so fucking easy.
---
So we‚Äôre all just supposed to ignore the fact your player and target frames are just arbitrarily in the sorta middle left of your screen?  No sir, I cannot.
---
Or have one person under the desk.
---
Exactly. I actually suggested in a post long before classic launch that it would be nice to have a 3rd server option: balanced pvp, where you literally can't attack someone more than like 5 levels lower than you unless they "flagged" themselves by attacking someone 5 levels higher than them.
---
It would stop level 60s ganking in stv and such, but not stop same level fights, and would fix the low level raid problem described above.
---
I'm barely on level 10 üòÇ but he is loving the return of classic &lt;3 On it the majority of his waking hours and beaming (and a time or two pouting) like a kid in a candy shop so I'm happy.  Slowly but surely ü§ó
---
Doesn't increase crit chance?
---
No lie thats a rough spot to be in. It seems like you are way underleveled or overleveled, getting xp takes forever, and you end up bouncing between zones. All of that, without a mount.

Had an offer that if I reserve both dal'rends for a rogue he'll pay me 50g if they drop 200g. I said yea cool, sure why not. Had 0 whisps for 15 minutes until I said "i just want to do the dungeon, sorry man" and he left.

Theres a burning steppes farm you can do as long as you can kill the elite dragonkin. I did it while farming Deathmaw. Theres was one up every 5-10 minutes

---
Stoner PSA. Watch out smoking near fan, res easily builds up inside your PC
---
Huh? Maul is the highest single target threat in the game. Druids generate more threat than warriors. Get the 5pts in feral instinct if you're struggling. My maul is almost as powerful as a taunt.
---
Ah yes, truly "Classic's famous design", where the chest can despawn thus locking you out of completing it, but if multiple people loot it they all get their own unique treasures.
---
So not only do you sit and drink out of range of your group, but you also take the time to loot AFTER you are done drinking?  You should really work on your game and quit blaming your groups for not waiting around for you after every pull.
---
You claim to be so low on mana after every fight that you're not even at 50% when you are forced to get up and start healing again.  You go through two stacks of water and mana potions.
---
If any of this is even remotely true then you are using the most inefficient heals in your toolkit, and probably overhealing as well.  Figure out which ones are more efficient and which ranks you should be downgrading to.  Your group mates are right, other healers can do it better than you, and that's why you are being kicked.
---
Have you been gambling?
---
Yeah they made Rogues pvp ez mode in TBC
---
Better start grinding!
---
Nah, but for real though it's not that big of a deal when you're 60. Considering the epic mounts are 1k, that's pocket change =P
---
I know
---
You know what I'm not even going to edit that. Good catch.
---
Gotta get that Void knight gear somehow
---
Did someone say my name?
---
The next phase probably won't drop until the end of the year.
---
If you're not going to get server-first on anything, then there's little reason to rush to 60 asap.
---
And I think that decision was wrong.
---
You and 100 others giving me a suggestion I was already aware of
---
Devils advocate: some people who play pvp servers are there for the uneven fights. Those are the people running around low level zones ganking. They would likely be even more happy with more faction unbalance, because that means almost any time there would be a fair fight, there's more of their faction around to help than the other person has.
---
It seemed like a joke to me
---
Yeah if you 'enable tracker' in the tracker section of the questie settings it should expand it.
---
F is my highest used skill, whatever it is, for that class.  Natural resting position for the hands, I guess

It's fine. I'm a warrior, and got my mount at 40. Some people are just terrible at gaining and managing their gold. 10g is a lot at 26. Gold intake picks up at lvl 35, and then picks up harder after 40.
---
I don't if people want to give their friends priority over loot in a friend situation because it doesn't affect me but if I'm running a dungeon at 60 it's with the intent on getting a chance at loot.  If I'm told anything is reserved that I want from that run and I'm a PUG member I'm leaving.  No point in wasting my time.
---
This is a great reminder for people to always clarify loot rules when joining a raid.  It will force them to state this crap before you waste your time.  
---
P.S. reserving loot is only okay in 100% guild/friend runs.  No one wants to raid without a chance for reward.

I want my own private RL layer. I wouldn't do anything illegal, but damn people are dangerous and unpredictable to be around. I drove to just get something from the store the other day, not far, just about a 10 minute round trip. IN the middle of the road two people decide to try to side-swipe each other in their cars and then get out and yell at each other for no apparent reason. Myself and a woman in the vehicle next to me held back about 100 feet while I yelled at them to "jerk each other off on the side of the road at least so we can be on our way" before they got in their separate cars and drove off in different directions. Please give me my own layer.

Fishing is a waste of time in most cases don‚Äôt listen to them. These are stories of when they got lucky with eels (or whatever) and luckily caught a dip in supply -&gt; apply that to a steady GPM that you can ‚Äúconsistently‚Äù achieve. 
---
Consistency is farming mobs and sell off whatever is worth selling off. Don‚Äôt overthink it, being active in the game, always looting, will make you well off.
---
Exactly what I'm hearing.  Just like there are too many entitled tanks who don't know what good tanking really looks like in a dungeon, so goes the same for healers.

I‚Äôve been ganked by hunters a lot as a mage, and what seems to work out 90% of the time is straight up slowing me down and sending most of their DPS shots against me, then I panic, run, try to sheep and that‚Äôs when the pet finishes me. I hate hunters and if I see one I blink away.
---
It's so I don't have to move my eyes all the way to the top left of my screen to see things like hp, mana, debuffs.
---
Yup and better yet these guilds are rushing and in between raids those geared people are doing NOTHING.
---
I've asked our raid team to come PvP, or help run some mid 50's dungeons to help us out and they never want to do anything but sit around and wait for raids to reset. A few of them have even started just signing on to chat then signing off til reset day. Cuz that's helpful.
---
Like wtf, this isn't retail, raids are like 30% of the content this game provides. I was really looking forward to guilds forming raid teams and then those raid teams branching out and leading PvP missions, or creating content throughout the world. WoW lore is based on Alliance vs Horde, not everyone vs Ony/Rag. Yet all these end game people seem to disregard the open world content available. All they care about it getting BiS gear, then waiting for phase 2.
---
You mark 1 player that knows how to do the dance and you follow them the entire fight. It's a brain dead encounter. For the last 2 expansions there's been LFR encounters where you can't ignore mechanics. This isn't dragon soul anymore.
---
I'd rather see a video of the duel than this lol just saying "rogue beats mage" but doesn't explain how..
---
Beautiful.
---
Just take your time man. The game will be here for a long time, take it at your own pace and enjoy it. Nobody says you have to hit 60 even in the first phase.
---
I'm the one that would switch someone to salv myself if I was the pally.
---
Actually, when i play a pally, i start everyone but the tank with salv and switch people to dps buffs if they show they can dps without gaining aggro during the first few trash packs. When they pull aggro a few times they go back to salv.
---
My job as the healer is to keep the tank alive so the dps can do their job, and if I have to lower your damage so the person who takes less damage than  you keeps threat, consider it done.
---
Life‚Äôs a game
---
You have to have devs that are truly committed to the classic design style, and aren't going to listen to casual player feedback. Thats how you end up with things like LFG and LFR. I think an OSRS style system could work, but it would be for feedback only and not a definitive choice.

That‚Äôs totally not right. He went in through the exit. There is actually a hole that you can fall into like in the movie.

---
oh boy, i remember that time this paladin thought it'd be funny to enter a combat stance while staring at me, so i just smiled and walked in front of his auto attack swing, which caused multiple booty bay guards to start attacking him while i waved at him.
---
Second to hunters in terms of what? Because mages absolutely level more quickly than druids.
---
You haven't played retail since WoD but don't let that stop you from acting like you know how LFR is.

Well, they could have crushed him if the shaman had just dropped a tremor totem.

Yeah but humans did the same thing. Waaaah orcs are coming to push us off the land that we pushed the trolls off.

Honestly I have a pretty hard time balancing things.  I hadn‚Äôt played WoW in a long time and resubbed for classic three weeks ago.  The big issue for me is as long as I am subbed and I can play, them I strongly want to play!  I have been enjoying classic tremendously but I‚Äôll probably take a break and then resub over the winter months.  
---
I try to think of my long term goals and always keeping that as a priority and not let my gaming hobby become my primary focus instead.
---
FORTH, EORLINGAS

got it, thank you for letting me know
---
Enjoy your diarrhea!

12 slot how that early?
---
People saying 'just switch servers/factions' obviously have a lot of damn time on their hands.  Most people aren't going to reroll another server or faction after they spent days of play time on a character.
---
The real vanilla answer is, that's the way it always was.  Sucks at times, but is also great at times too.  Smaller pop is actually a benefit in BG ques once they come out IMO, tons of randoms on the other faction means a lot of easy wins.
---
Or role PvE, that's usually my answer when people talk about imbalance.
---
MT.... Empty. Coincidence?
---
What addon is that xp bar?
---
Mount would overcome a runner in 5 seconds.
---
Basically: they added PvP realms after the fact, which is why they are labeled as PvP realms, but PvE realms are "normal." PvP realms are more the equivalent of EverQuest realms: the hardcore version. Normal realms is where players were intented to play, and PvP realms were for people that wanted those old game styles. Remember: WoW wasn't the first MMORPG, and it was pretty casual for the time.
---
Any form of automated (repeating or self directed) program is against the rules. That said...
---
Why don't you use the ingame macro system to tag them...? You can have it autotarget only devilsaurs and have it cast an ability/start auto attacking in a single button push.
---
Back in Vanilla I played a feral druid. On day me and a friend decided that we would prove to our core dungeon group that druids can tank. We went into Scholo and told our warrior to grab his 2h and dps. Our standard group was holy priest, warrior (not sure of spec), 2 feral druids, and an enhancement shaman. That night we cleared the dungeon faster then any other night and had only 1 death. Our shaman had a crazy windfury multi crit on a boss and took a hard death. (This was the kind of crit that would pull agro off any tank. Enhancement shamans know all about it too well.) With 2 druids though he was revived mid fight back to full hp and mana. 
---
My point is druids can tank and are good at it. People just need to be open to the idea of GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO BUILD SOME THREAT. Druid tanks take a bit longer to establish threat. But is this any difference then letting your warrior get 4 sunder armors on the kill target and then attack?  The plus defense gear is a bit harder to find but possible. Leather workers make a cloak. Rings and necklaces can be farmed. 
---
I would love to have a bear tank for me.

Basically the botting rules are: if ANYTHING controls your character for you without you having to press a button, that's a problem.
---
Got an auto clicker to cast frostbolt for you while raiding? That's botting. Even if you're literally watching it happen while waiting to have to move or use a potion or whatever.
---

---
Scotch is ALWAYS handy....
---
&gt;Would you consider it ninja looting or bad form to need roll on Whitemane's Chapeau (level 29 to wear) as a level 35 druid when you have a level 40 priest in your party? 
---
This was what you asked and all the information you provided. Let me guess you're the priest? No spec/role information given. If it's a lvl 29 item and druid is healing/caster dps, then that seems like a great item for them. Apparently he wasnt? It could also been a situation where his main is a healer but was filling the tanker role for the simple fact that tanks were more needed. Point being, I answered your question to the best of my ability with the information given. 
---
Sorry you lost the chapeau.
---
it is the same thing actually the ammount of threat will be the same as needed we are considering a player as one individual

In 1.12 yes, not as good as nowadays but they were min maxed

Also because of people like me that undercut everything so my stuff sells first :)
---
World chat?
---
Warlock quest
---
A big part of it is that gear with school specific damage values tend to have higher +dmg values than the general ‚Äú+ magic damage‚Äù items
---
I dont think my argument changes much if it's a dungeon or raid.
---
If it's a low level dungeon it's kinda laughable, but if the warrior did 10 runs of armory and still no ravaged axe, I can understand reserving it
---
High level dungeon runs like stratholme, done by a raid geared tank, it's common for them to reserve the first Crusader orb. That's the cost of having a quick smooth run
---
Bruh you knew this.   You sound like the same
---
Shills that cried long ago and ruined any further sexy armor development in wow.
---
People acting like there aren't already ten's of thousands of 60's and plenty of people making alts, yeah week 1 it was ridiculous seeing people listing items for stupid prices but we're at the point now where impatient people will pay high prices to get something instantly rather than waiting to save a few gold.
---
Also apart from the command always make a backup of your WTF folder when you install addons so that you can go back if they mess up, I learned that with TukUI too since it messed a lot, though I didn‚Äôt installed it and went for ElvUI and that seems more forgiving and complete for moving things and resizing stuff in the UI, /moveui is the best.

The "macro" im talking about is just my razer synapse clicking 9000 times at 1sec for me. In order to tag Devilsaur and skin it as fast as possible when hes dead, and also to click on the leather at the loot window.

I like going against warlocks as shaman and watch them freeze up when their fear only lasts a second.
---
Your perception of the rarity of reserving loot in vanilla is based on your individual experience. It may have been rare for you to have seen it, but quite common for others. 
---
For example, I played on Shattered Hand and Korgath in vanilla - two of the top US servers. Loot reserves were quite common in pugs started by a small group of guildies or friends. Unlike OP‚Äôs example, however, loot reserves were communicated in trade or lfg chat when listing the group (eg LFM UBRS DalRends Reserved). 
---
The DKP system you‚Äôre talking about is for full guild groups, not PUGs. Full guild groups don‚Äôt reserve items (except maybe legendaries) precisely *because* socialized systems like DKP and Loot Council were on place. PUGs reserves items because they can‚Äôt feasibly utilize systems like DKP or Loot Council and loot is simply rolled off. If the intent in forming the group is to give your friend/guildie the highest possible chance of obtaining a piece of loot, that piece gets reserved.

You seem dismissive of his mental health. Was he ever tested?
---
Gratz!

Btw. Is blink bound to a key?
---
60 with some pre-raid bis and assortment of other dungeon gear, doesn‚Äôt take much really just gets a whole lot easier as you gear up.
---
I stopd 10 hours pn that spot where I can see all 3 points, but now I camp at one spot while doing stuff at home
---
Some groups did this, IE lava runs in BRD, but it was far less than what you're describing.
---
I figured he meant sprit but you are probably right
---
That's not true.  Any chance on hit effect that isn't weapon based will work in feral form.  Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom was something that druids often ran/wanted.  
---
Go look at the old wowhead comments from back in the day about it.
---
Yeah but if they "idk I just like to be a mage cuz jokerd" I'd second think a raid invite for them anyways.  Anyone playing braindead should only be brought along if you need bodies for your 40man.
---
FUCK
---
What about it?
---
I've played with a few locks who don't use shadowbolt, and let me assure you that it is awful.
---
It‚Äôs actually the vanquisher‚Äôs sword from a quest to kill last boss in rfd. I think the dagger is black menace from the quest to kill all the SM bosses.

One up it. Constantly BoP melee DPS who pull aggro before they even pull it. That gives you some fun rage!
---
I‚Äôve been hearing a lot about this and it bums me out lol, I‚Äôm getting ready to start running SM and I just wanna run it old school I don‚Äôt care about exp per hour lol
---
I have a warlock main and am stuck deciding between druid or pally for my tank/healer hybrid alt.
---
I mained priest and warrior alt in vanilla, so chose warlock as main dps. I want to be able to tank/heal 5/10 mans and heal raids. 
---
I like druid versatility and the high skill cap ceiling. I don't like staring at the pet forms because you can't see your gear unless healing.  I know druid has a harder time healing also because of the 30 min rez. Paladin I like the feel of the class but the skill ceiling seems a lot lower, and it feels like the class will be a lot more boring at 60 due to this. 
---
I also want to be able to farm effectively and be in demand for 5/10 mans and raiding without having trouble getting groups. The gear dependency of weapons for pally also doesn't appeal to me. I would go HotW spec for the druid 0/30/21 so I could heal and tank as needed. 
---
I'm also a veteran raider from vanilla and in other MMOs, so I want something engaging and that has a high skill ceiling. That said, I will be a semi-hardcore player with the time I have to play. And if I enjoy it enough I may make the druid/pally my true main, since pure DPS has never been what I enjoy best. I've always enjoyed support roles more in WoW dungeons and raids. 
---
So with all that said, any advice on which to stick with? I got both to around 30 in vanilla so I have a general feel for the classes and their gameplay. 
---
Thanks for any input! I know this isn't the what should I choose thread but I plan on playing a lot this weekend and want to put some good time into leveling up.
---
Immolate really isn‚Äôt that great or mana efficient, and definitely shouldn‚Äôt be the first spell in your rotation. You‚Äôre better off just leading with corruption in most situations.
---
That's exactly what it was. Thanks. In hindsight, I can understand why that wouldn't be defaulted because all of that scrolling text could be distracting. I just assumed it was a macro because I didn't believe in Blizzard being that intuitive with the UI lol
---
Lol I just know what I'm talking about and you don't. Good to know your standards are even lower.
---
I have an xbox desk setup that's is a lot better

---
What is BiS
---
I think you're right. The way Attack Power is described as working in game is to increase the damage per second of your melee attacks. Neglecting any difference in Strength on comparable weapons (i.e. holding attack power constant), your Weapon DPS increase from AttkPower is constant for both weapons. To find the average per swing increase to damage from Attack Power, you would multiply times Weapon Speed.
---
This is why both weapons can have the exact same *base* damage range, but once Attack Power is factored in, the slower (and lower dps) weapon actually has higher top-end damage.
---
&gt;Aggro &amp; Threat are the same.
---
In this context it's not. Aggro is the state of having the highest threat, where the mob is focused on you. Threat is the numerical value assigned to how close you are to having aggro.
---
Aaaaand Todd Howard got me AGAIN at the end!
---
Yea start questing in Barrens. 
---
Also join lfg (looking for group) channel.  
---
Get into a group for Ragefire Chasm dungeon. (RFC).  You can go as dps or try tanking.  If you‚Äôd like to tank, read up on it a bit.  People in Org or barrens might post they are LF dps for RFC.  You can whisper them and ask to join.  RFC is in org so easy to get to. 
---
The addon questie, which you can get from twitch mods, will help you with questing. 
---
Also Warcraft Tavern has some great guides for leveling efficiently.  I loosely follow them.
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/nightfalls-wow-classic-horde-leveling-guide/
---
Also don‚Äôt hesitate to ask ppl to add you to friends.  Grouping up with others can be one of the fun aspects of wow
---
Mirage Raceway has a Nice horde community feel free to join us. Lovely people all around.
---
The difference is how many people can fuck up and the raid still be free loot. Herding cats means not all of them do as you ask thats the point of the saying.  Have your pug fuck up spacing on C'thun and still beat him and I'll be impressed.  I think it's different because of the same reason you're saying it's the same.  We'll see when the real raids come though.  Everything before AQ40 is a joke, we can agree on that.
---
It didn't disappear overnight, it just slowly getting less and less every week. 3 weeks ago you'd have to wait 2 hours, last week 30 min, now gone, during week day prime time.
---
The classic hype is also dying on twitch. It even have less viewer now than BFA did 3 weeks into launch. Give it a few more weeks I bet you won't even see it on the front page any longer
---
I was thinking this too
---
Yup alliance is favored on heartseeker right now. Will probably be the closest to 50/50 server for phase 2 and I'm super pumped.
---
Does it have KFC gravy?
---
I save BoP to use as a scuffed taunt
---
3 is pretty easy once you get the hang of it, you could even do 3 casters with felstalker or succubus. I only tried 4 on accident usually didn't work out good but sometimes it did.
---
The olive raptor ü§¢ü§¢
---
I healed thogg in Durotar around level 10 and he thanked me, then I‚Äôve been seeing him in barrens chat a lot. People give him grief for how he talks but it really makes my day to know he‚Äôs having a great time and bringing joy to many people
---
this is just fate of pvp servers.
---
Beyond holding the primary target threat your job is to pull mobs off the healer first, DPS second. Ideally though, the pulling of mobs off DPS/healers is due to unavoidable situations as opposed to mistakes/bad play.
---
It is the DPS's job to only single target attack the primary target, and in some cases lower their DPS to match what the tank can hold so they don't cause pulls to go wonky. Sometimes if the tank is busy, a DPS with sufficient threat can say pull a mob off the healer and bring it close to the tank for them to taunt.
---
It is the healer's job to, if possible, wait for the tank to get threat before healing him at the start of a pull so the healing threat doesn't draw aggro from mobs the tank hasn't hit much at that point. After that point healer has the least involvement in threat management because if they're drawing threat it's due to the healing required to keep people alive being high. Dropping threat is impossible without letting people die at that point.
---
So really, everyone is involved to some degree.
---
No
---
How is it 2019?  Linear progression of time.
---
Why is it harder?  We're fucking grown.
---
Consider this:
---
The world actually ended in 2012.  Rather than all of us dying, our reality was just instantaneously superimposed into another reality.  This "new world" that we were sent to is almost identical, but has just a few minor details that are slightly different.  This could very well be the cause of the Mandela Effect (Berenstein Bears vs Berenstain Bears etc).  So technically layering probably already exists (string theory) but we just dont have control over the matrix we are living in, so we can't take advantage of it.
---
I‚Äôm a 60 with no addons. I‚Äôm in the same boat brother. Grate on the mount.

---
Thats the context of this comment thread you dense inbred.  You replied to my comment which was a reply to comparing LFR and Naxx.   
---
Obviously you can't even handle how Reddit works.  My oh my.
---
at 40?  Dark pact.
---
You get to have so life through using your fellhunter or succubus' mana pool instead of your own life to get back your magic.  Plus you have the most instants so interrupts and CC interfere the least.
---
I believe pick-pocketing is classified as a spell, thats why it says resist not miss. And yes, there are a lot of resists, on private servers there was one with almost no resists, and another where they nerfed BRD pick-pocketing by making the mobs resist more. Rogues diary is only 2s50c, on private servers it was 45s. If you do BRD PP for gold, I would say there are better methods such as LBRS pyromancer kills, but depends on the market.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the lunch in tirisfal glades
---
I would tank more willingly if Druid and Paladin were actually viable in later raids. Why Blizzard made them so inferior in comparison is beyond me
---
My main beef about WoW from the beginning is it was a Min and Max game with a endless ladder. Alot of the PvP groups never left the instances and it became simply a farming game. Mmorg PvP died after WoW.
---
Everyone's.  If the dps don't allow you time to generate threat then they're not doing it right.  You gotta be a good tank too though.  If someone pulls aggro before the enemy is hitting you they need to stop.
---
Seriously. There's pugs willing on trash in MC on Skeram. It's hardly equivalent to the cake walk that is LFR in retail.
---
this is awesome, thank you so much. i believe i understand now.
---
Fragile as fuck.

Join the Bloodsail Buccaneers and raid these neutral towns. Kill all the alliance you want when there's no more guards.

---
How much time do those guilds spend farming mats to be able to clear in under an hour?
---
It kind of sounds like you've already decided to play a Druid but I will give my input as a Paladin player. 
---
Paladin is a supporting role, even in the lore they are their to bolster their allies and are hardly ever the star of the show. Everyone will always want a Paladin in your group for the buffs alone. I'm level 44 and find myself regularly rethinking the best way to buff a party. At 44 I have Wisdom, Might, Sanctuary, King, Salvation, Protection, Light and Sacrifice. When I was describing classes to my friends I explained how every class was good in it's own way, and then they asked "Why do you play paladin". I told them that Paladins are good at one thing, and one thing only. Paladins out live everything, Last night I was in a 15 minute battle against pirates in Tanaris, I was standing on a chest and I fought pirates for so long that the ones I originally killed started respawnin and I have to rebuff myself twice. I must of killed 15 of them before I finally left combat and at no point did I think I was going to die. I had such slow kill speed that I couldn't stop them running away and I couldn't use my abilities to kill them faster because I needed to use all of my mana to heal myself. I agree that they have a low skill ceiling but I think Paladins need something other than skill to be good, and that is patience. To play a paladin you need patience, if you're determined you can always come out on top.
---
That was a full guild group and technically a Loot Council decision, not a reserve. 
---
Also, if HM stands for Heroic Mode or Hard Mode, there was no such thing. Sunwell Plateau - like all vanilla raids - had one difficulty. Hard Mode raids weren‚Äôt a thing until Ulduar in WotLK.
---
Tank is exactly the same as dps but the numbers are invisible.
---
Reserving is fine as long as you announce it when you search and before you use up their time.
---
A healing priest won't give two shits about dalrend being reserved

I played a pally in vanilla and theres a couple things that really stuck out to me. Ret is horrible it just doesnt have the dps and its super slow. End game youll be a healer but you wont really be able to heal 5 mans. Youll be a great single target healer in raids with your 3 heals. I didnt play a druid in vanilla but i can atleast give my opinion on end game content pally in vanilla. Things might have changed since then but if i had to choose between the two i would definitely go druid.
---
I'm not really sure how it's a cash grab, cheap or otherwise? Classic doesn't have microtransactions, and it's included in your subscription. If you don't want to pay money, then stop playing, or go to a private server. Not sure what you mean by cash grab.
---
He just needs a huge sandwich with an entire rotisserie chicken inside of it. He's not evil... he's just hangry.
---
Sold one 2 nights ago for 420g. Wasn't sure to sit on it or go ahead and guarantee my epic mount @ 60. Dire Maul has a mace that's almost as good and will be available in P2. 
---
Depends on your server population and just random luck as to how many are in circulation right now, but on Herod Alliance they've been floating around 400-500g but don't seem to actually sell at that price super well. Typically 2-6 listed at any given time, tho.
---
Exactly 70 kills before I got my bear pants. Note how its not even on this pie chart. Thats how bullshit farming it is...
---
I was in almost the exact same situation, and I ended up getting my mount at 42. I think you‚Äôll be okay.
---
You can 5man ony and 10man mc, how?
---
For exposure?
---
The OP was pointing out a comparison of the damage ranges (same on item vs different on character stat pane). The answer to that is solely an AP-weapon speed interaction. I don't know why people keep wanting to confuse the issue by bringing up instant attacks and normalization, which, while related to the phenomenon being demonstrated, so nothing to answer the mathematical reason behind what was highlighted in the image.
---
Fire Elementals and Ragnaros.
---
You wasted 10-15% of your DW, and you cheaped out on pots. But yeah, nice ability.
---
okay me *maybe* that kind of orc... ;)
---
If you can spare the $15 a month get another account lol you can have a bankalt you can use without logging off your main and an alt to level when you're camping. That's about the only advice I have at this point...
---
Yep, make a list of what dungeons you need, and what bosses are crucial for you.
---
Tanking is a lot harder than DPS. People want the easy job that lets them browse Youtube while pressing 2 or 3 buttons.
---
Start the group yourself, lfm fill it up and go.  You don't have to sit and wait for a group that is looking for 1 more.  You don't have to join a cleave group if you are not there just for the xp.  Build a group for full run problem solved.  The cleave groups are just eating up mages, there are plenty of hunters rogues warriors etc.  Willing to do full runs.
---
&gt;I'm so damn torn between Warlock and Rogue as my main.
---
Im actually leveling both as my primary two characters.  I figure that at endgame groups will be either looking for more spell power ranged or melee and either way it works.  I am planning on letting the social situation at 60 to dictate my main.
---
Be careful, logic gets downvoted in an entirely opinionated post.
---
Mages are, within their respective role, the best performing class in the game. This was known well ahead of time. Elitist players are smart cookies, and many of them are obviously going to choose the best class for themselves. It slants the population of mages towards elitism because they are very much players that will always seek out "the best". That's issue one.
---
They are also the best native gold farmers in the game, but have the single most useful utility as well. So their time is worth more to them than most classes, while many other classes also have a high need for the mage's time to get that water/food/portal. 
---
Issue three is, as you said, dickwad mages aoe'ing quest mobs directly inconveniencing other classes while also displaying their class' strongpoint.
---
Issue four: Due to spellcleave leveling mages both level more frequently and also spam in LFG chats about groups that the rest of us mere mortals are actively unwelcome in.
---
~
---
And naturally, it's the worst face of a group that represents it not the best. So you've got rich elitist pricks who don't want to bother giving you food/water you desperately want that fairly frequently display how they're better than you by having fancy dinner parties peasants aren't allowed to attend and taking mobs away from you while you're struggling to quest.
---
That is who represents mages.
---
If pugs checked your gear and kicked out a lower geared rogue or w/e in favor of the more geared one sure, but I've never seen that happen so far. It would definitely be a thing in future raids but not now.
---
Somebody randomly gave me 5 potion

Once DM is out you'll be able to get MC level gear much quicker. BWL doesn't need amazing gear. Only two fights are gear checks, Vael and Chrommagus, mostly just a high health and mana pool for the 2nd. Razorgore can be done in greens if everyone is coordinated, the three drakes could be done in in Gray's (exhagerating) but would take a while. 
---
After BWL you have ZG to get you caught up before AQ, and AQ20 once AQ is out. Naxx is really the only one where being subbed from AQ to Naxx for raid logging is required, but if you wanna catch up MC and BWL are smashed through in no time every week at that point cause they still have gear that's relivant till phase 6, giving you lots of ways to make up gaps in time you missed.

If all don‚Äôt need the BoE blues/epics, you‚Äôre just leaving your pants down waiting to get fucked.  People that have been playing with this loot system for years have already established that all needing BoEs is the best method.  Continue trying to be nice and passing/greeding and all you‚Äôre doing is enabling actual ninjas.  If everyone decides to all need then suddenly they are powerless.

DKP is not a viable loot system in PUGs, which is the type of group OP joined.

I just do it for the blinding powder.

Bis lists as a concept are pretty stupid. Realistically speaking very few players will ever complete them, so why does the community insist that's our resource to use for gearing?

Missing the forest for the trees I'd say.
---
at 40 you can go 31 affliction for Dark Pact.
---
You get to tap your pet's mana to your mana bar, rather than from your HP, so you get to use succubus or fellhunter (or imp) all the time.

The rest of the spec is about improving drain soul and is known as "drain tanking"

Had a pally tanking RFD the other day. Said it'd be faster "with this group", I was healing and everyone had aggro. Good times, really.

So I'm playing a rogue, just got Lord General's Sword drop which I've heard is super good. I was running Thrash Blade in MH and Vanq Sword in OH, but when I put LGS in MH and TB in OH my character sheet shows a DPS decrease. Does the LGS passive proc often enough to really make it better than TB + Vanq?

I personally really enjoy my druid. Just hit 37 today. I can tank any dungeon, dps any dungeon, and heal any dungeon so far, though I usually end up tanking. Druids also generate a lot of threat so as long as people attack skull I'm never chasing mobs. They ability to throw both my HoTs on and go bear into an elite or a pack of mobs is a great feeling. The cat speed bonus and travel form are great. You dont have to buy anything in balance after you get bear form and I haven't had to upgrade my heals since the mid twenties so at 37 I have 60g towards my mount from just vendoring everything. Plus I never have to stop, I can fight 3 mobs in a row, shift out, heal myself, and by the time I kill 3 more mobs I've got almost all or all my mana back. The only hard part is figuring out which stat to prioritize as they're all useful but I've found just stacking agi and str works great.
---
Also for end game tanking druids are actually better than warriors on some bosses since they can have such a high threat output using manual crowd pummelers because every white hit is affected by the threat modifier where warriors need to sunder or heroic strike to reach the same amount of threat per hit and mcp increases your attack speed by 50% for 30 seconds up to three times. They're also slightly easier to gear prebis compared to warriors.

Enhance shaman here. Everyone wants to combine pulls, but no one wants to let me take a Mana break. I've given up on using the under-levelled mage water because it's just not fast enough. I don't know if it's retail or this spellcleave BS, but people need to learn to fucking use CC and focus targets down. Yeah, it feels slower, but if you've got an offspec healer and two DPS who are under-levelled it's waaaay faster to play things safe!
---
I laughed at the thought of some anon behind a desk fervently scribbling bad notes about someone for asking if they can have dibs on emberstone staff
---
Did you steal my La-Z-Boy?
---
Are you in the LookingForGroup and world chat channels?
---
ALLIANCE IN MY PRESENCE? HOW DARE THEY
---
That and pvp but yeah that's about it.  Obviously worth noting that the raids and dungeons are more complex than classic so are a lot more replayable outside the loot value.  People chase titanforges and dailies cause it's a lot of small things that progress your character.
---
I'm sure they're grateful you're advertising them for free here.
---
You‚Äôre doing the Lord‚Äôs work. God bless.
---
Have him sing in voice chat. He's the bard now and his songs are fire.
---
Maybe the best setup I've ever seen.
---
Yeah I'm thinking druid just because I would like to try tanking endgame while primarily healing raids. And the 0/30/21 HotW spec sounds really fun.
---
I had the same thing happen in Dustwallow! Me vs. 2 spiders, got webbed and they were dumping on me. Mage runs up as I'm trying to run away, Frost Nova&gt;sheep me&gt;blizzard spiders. Wanded me, bowed and left.
---
A few minutes later I see him getting smacked by 4 spiders that I guess all resisted Nova? I charged a spider, used intimidating shout targeting the mage, hit him one and we booked it. He sheeped me and waved a few more times after that.
---
Thanks gnome buddy!
---
Sure, I'm already 60 though.  But yeah, the only time I was able to find a full clear group was when I made one myself.  It was just annoying.
---
Literally was the first one I could think of lol, but k. 
---
Sorry you like pussy passive leaders like Thrall that just decide ‚Äúfuck the horde‚Äù out of nowhere, I like badass Warchiefs.
---
Hahahaha, get fucked, talkin' shit about tendies. I did up-doot your diarrhea comment, because it's funny, and maybe true sometimes. Just because you're right doesn't mean you're correct.
---
I have gatorbite from mara ,but on hit effect gives half of Kangs effect .
---
Executioner's cleaver is basically your BiS as a warrior up until maybe Dreadforge Retaliator or twig of the world tree if you're a human.
---
Oh, yeah. Thanks for refreshing my mind.
---
The weapon was called "Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury", one of the best DPS weapons for Hunters back then. And yet it was passed to thier rogue. Short story: they did it because thier rogue was with them far longer than thier hunter(s). This drama went viral on the WoW forum:

&gt; . The only downside is the rezz.
---
Honestly, thats my main reason for not wanting a druid healer in 5 mans. For a pug, I need at least one reliable rez.
---
Unless you people like to talk a lot it doesn't matter since a GM can go through the log for the entire run in minutes. A screenshot is a waste of time and provides no useful info that they don't already have. Besides if giving the exact timestamp is so important to you why not you know write it to the report?
---
You don't even know the difference between nuggies and tendies.  Please leave.
---
I do. I still get paid for 2080 hrs.
---
I complain about getting constantly healed to 100... Let me manage my hp, 9 times out of 10 I'm gonna be fine. Let me die the 10th time
---
I truly want to express how much I needed to hear this. I went back in choosing a class I never once played in retail. Almost immediately I was swarmed with this "meta" demanding I spec exactly the same as everyone else. What's worse is that it's become so much a staple that people don't even see my class anymore. I'm tired of being judged for being something I don't even want to be. 
---
From now on. I, High wizzard Wazzlespark shall no longer be a filthy frost mage. But shall endeavor to understand the intricacies and splendor of the arcane! For the Alliance!
---
I believe you are correct. I was told ‚ÄúGo back to retail‚Äù because a Shaman didn‚Äôt like me (tanking for that instance) asking him politely to stop pulling.
---
Definitely not worth the money as there are cheaper options but the Mara 2hs are definitely noticably worse than Kang for arms.
---
True story
---
Id consider myself a pvp orientes ,but ill look into cleaver
---
Im green and big

If you have 60g and you really fucking want it, then sure pay 60g.  Otherwise use common sense an not buy it.
---
Other Horde Warriors. Druids are rare enough that you will hardly see 2 in a dungeon.
---
Hell I was doing an MC pug and we struggled to find 1 druid for MOTW and Thorns.
---
A renew will not pull Agro when combat starts until the priest does something after combat is initiated. At that point the renew threat will be applied to the priest. Defcamp and Malderon have an in depth video about the topic worth watching by anyone interested. Because of the video I pre renew all the time and have never taken agro because of it.
---
I haven't seen this at all and I'm level 45 on Fairbanks.
---
Well it's news to me lol.
---
Hunter = Easy mode
---
This. Lots had to come together before people could do this. Changes to classes, rebalances, changes to threat, stats, gear, itemization and bug fixes (esp the frost aoe fixes) all make doing runs like this easier and possible. 
---
It was in patches 1.10 and 1.11 where runs like this could be done but nobody at the time was doing it since everyone was already max level and already geared out.
---
Yeah that's the one worry I have with druid. Although on my server when I /who 60 it seems there are TONS of 60 pallies, and only a few 60 druids. So hopefully if I'm a good player it won't be difficult to get raid spots. And as long as I join a good progression guild I should be able to have a permanent spot. I just played priest in warrior in vanilla and I'm sure the demand will be much less compared to those. Getting whispered on login for dungeons or raids was always nice, I really wanna give a hybrid a shot though this time.
---
I have been resisting the temptation to reactivate for classic, but all these posts about warlocks are making me nostalgic. It was amazing being a PvP machine in late vanilla... definitely made up for all those times I got ganked leveling in Hillsbrad/Arathi/Badlands.
---

People like you are why I trash every single ally people mention in general. Fight fire with fire

I don't even see how metagaming could apply here, that refers to player characters in RPG's using real world information that their character shouldn't otherwise be aware of.

can i get a update?

Shouldnt you be using devilsaur?

The pets that are behind him that he cant hit back due to the fact they're behind him? I'm not sure what your point is. Its even worse if he blew Retal to deal with the pets, since they're not even the real threat. Maybe the hunter pet is, maybe. The other was a blueberry, and he was getting shot by a hunter and warlock.
---
Like...what?
---
I'm absolutely able to, again, that's why I used the words absolutely certain.
---
I've got all the data I need directly from the game to indicate that my 50% estimate is conservative, the real number is closer to 70%.
---
No point throwing it up for debate, cause like all numbers the people who read it are likely idiots who can't accept a view point other than the one they started with.  As someone that's actually looked at data of not just queues and the /who command, I am again absolutely certain that at least half of the people that have played WoW Classic at some point are now gone.
---
Disagree?  Cool stuff, post your data showing otherwise.  See where this is going?
---
On the next ATVI call we'll find out exactly how successful classic was, painted in the most positive light possible.  I'll be back to point how right I was then.  Until then, stay delusional!
---
Good idea üòÅ
---
I did every quest that offered Darnassus rep that was available at my level and was only 15% into revered. You absolutely have to do turn ins.

If its not undead then yes warlocks can 1v1 rogue np

Druid.....
---
&lt;Arthas did nothing wrong&gt; is big in kromkrush
---
Not sure if theres any confirmed drops but it's in the game.... it's only like a 1% drop chance though
---
You're also a troll, so I probably won't. If you think that a bear can generate more threat than a warrior in a single target fight, you're smoking crack or referencing retail.
---
my understanding is it is more of a suggestion than a rule

As far as Oto's guide goes, yes, the BiS lists are wrong for Human Rogue.

---
1 Crit = 23 AP \[20\]

1 Hit = 18 AP \[16\]

1 Agi = 1.9 AP \[1.8\]

1 Str = 1.1 AP

I have an almost identical set up and honestly its fucking glorious

As Horde, I can level in The Barrens until 30 and then I go to a new zone to level, right?
---
Use my feet
---
Yeah but is the chopper available in classic?
---
May not win every fight, but your dots will take the other guy down with you
---
I can‚Äôt say
---
People ask for a layer, get an invite to a group, then they are basically in a new instance for the zone. 
---
In this case, if BrokenTooth wasn‚Äôt in his instance, then he asks for a group to go to another.  He‚Äôs a cheat

I don't care. Real life is a hellhole for me and WoW is one of my few avenues to feel like an actual person.

Just keep leveling.  At mid-50s-60 spam BRD until you can get a Dreadforge Retaliator.
---
Thanks for the input. I'm leaning druid just due to the high skill ceiling and the 0/30/21 HotW spec looks very satisfying being able to both heal and raid.  The thing I honestly like least is having to watch the morphs and not being able to see my gear while playing. I also have prefer human over nigh elf for looks but I haven't gotten a NE past 30ish so maybe it'll grow on me. 
---
Early on like 1-20 pally gameplay seems more fun just due to the slow but steady nature. But I think as I get 40+ druid will get more complex which I will really enjoy, while pally will still be doing seal &gt; judgment &gt; auto attack and spamming 1-2 spells for healing which I might regret once I hit 60 since I might find it boring.
---
Exactly
---
It's as if there's a rule that if you're a rogue, your name must include something about stabbing or blades
---
Pally is a more viable healer in 5/10 mans than druid though right due to having a rez?
---
Huge cogstok feel to this.
---
The server makes multiple copies of itself (layers). So instead of 1000 people being in stormwind there might be 10 layers with 100 people in it. Mobs and other spawns are also tied to layers. So if a legendary mob or whatever isnt alive on your layer you can ask someone for an invite and you'll change to their layer hence why it's a bannable exploit

"Have to"? Who are these people holding a gun to your head and forcing you to play?
---
Christ, the elitism and false superiority on this sub really is way out of hand. I've tanked basically ever dungeon I've ran on my warrior and if you really want to help the community improve it's important to remember two things. 
---
#1. Don't listen to all these snarky tanks and healers who insist on just letting DPS die if they pull aggro. You slow the run down for everyone when you do this shit just to prove a point. Teach them and be polite while still trying your best to hold aggro, if it becomes an issue to the point of significantly slowing the run down, then consider replacing.
---
#2. Insecure tanking is an epidemic. I struggled with this at first, I would always get kind of defensive when I lost aggro to a DPS. In classic, this is going to happen, holding threat is much more challenging than in retail and the DPS are going to pull aggro off you from time to time. Also, if you're group has some, say, mages that are good at kiting and are putting out sustainable AoE damage don't insist on bitching at them. All that matters is that the mobs die and you don't wipe, if the most efficient way to do that involves you not holding aggro for the majority of the run then fuck it, less repair cost for you. 
---
All that being said though don't take shit from anyone, if the healer can't keep up with DPS pulling aggro then that's when you tell them to slow down. You control the pace of the run for the most part.
---
Good luck.
---
An arms warriors on a pinto, a 2H mace and T2-helmet - yelling for men to go to war? I‚Äôll pass
---
Just 1, or a rogue with 300 lockpicking, or a warlock to suicide at the door.
---
Hear hear
---
Then what would a # represent? ‚ÄúNeed on shield?‚Äù Lol
---
No one should give him grief for that.
---
If you haven't done the in dreams or onyxia attunement quest chains, do those.
---
If you have, grind 5 mans and Target ones that drop the best loot for you. You'll be doing this at 60 anyway.
---
Thanks for the input. Yeah based on what I wrote out I think I'm leaning druid. I do like the pally fantasy and early gameplay though, very steady but kinda slow. I think I may just enjoy the druid complexity though more at end game.
---
Then get you the cleaver, my 57 warrior is still using it.
---
More like skipped as much content as possible and now they're crying about it.
---
Then try to do Mara really early for dat Thrasher Blade.
---
it's a gstretch
---
I thought the EXACT same comparison to Eric Cartman from South park.
---
You just made me laugh out loud. Then I felt bad, and now fuck it. I buried this a while ago. Just seeing him on Wow brought it all back for one more time.
---
Thanks üôè
---
If it's a BoP item you have to click confirm to loot it.
---
Eh? Just listen to your raid leader and if you‚Äôre not having fun and enjoying the game, try another guild or don‚Äôt raid.
---
IDK I have a couple thousand gold and nothing to spend it on. Have raid mats for at least 3 months and all prebis that can be bought. All I did was send everything except vendor trash to an ah alt and sell it, and that's all I continue to do. Good greens sell bad greens de. Cloth sell. Ore sell. Herbs sell. 
---
It all sells if you don't list it for too much. The ah is a nightmare unless you are willing to list for cheap.
---
Dominos
---
Yup. Just hit 40 and have 40g to my name. Time to grind rock elementals for 6 months
---
Not as a non-human.
---
Yup, there was no debate until the internet existed. Prior to that, it was 10,000 years of listening to the neckbeards who were 100% right all the time
---
Cool  thanks
---
I got the same drop last night off of the harpies in northern Feralas. I'm a rogue so I sold them on the AH and now I am set for gold for a long time.
---
Maybe switch over to free action options. Fishing needed though.
---
ofc its a NELF hunter lmao
---
Even those pathetic lowlifes will run out of people to oneshot.
---
Have you never heard of the wizards in Buffalo? They'll be gathering this sunday to go up against the most evil of foes.
---
That's the thing though, vast majority of "on hit" effects are on weapons, not gear.
---
Yes, but you'll be grinding mobs for 4 levels. Realistically, you'll be in the barrens until about 25, then head to STM, Ashenvale, or Hillsbrad
---
First thing I ask if I notice I'm filling out a guild group is if anything is reserved. 
---
If the answer is something I want, I usually leave.
---
Mirage Raceway is generally a great community on horde.  Ive said it before, but again,  if your faction is outnumbered, you'll generally have a good community.
---
Yeah well that sucks for whoever isn't a mage.
---
I‚Äôm doing while netted in BRD with aggro as the healer mate. All day
---
Related to the goon squad on mal'ganis? Because fuck that guild.
---
Also on kirtonos in Sauce
---
This was me on my first warrior, my new one had the shoulders first drop.
---
Patchwerk requires like 300 average dps. People are doing that in blues.
---
Yeah I agree completely. I play a shadow priest, in PvP I die because I run out of mana or don't have enough HP to ride out a big burst before I take the life back with VE.
---
+ Damage is nice but stamina lets you survive a burst and not have to switch to defensive mode. Being able to survive an opener and start attacking is way better than having to drop form to heal, renew bubble, switch back etc. You do 0 damage doing that.
---
Yes pallys have a rez but in raids it wont matter because so many people can rez. In 5 mans its alot easier to heal as a druid alot more mobility. They only have the 30 min cool down rez but that comes with more mobility in healing the group. Maybe i was just a shitty pally but in 5 mans i would have loved to have the hots and stuff druids have.
---
I read your comment and got triggered and then I read your username and burst out laughing.
---
OP joined WoW in BFA
---
Lol. Anyway what I've found is that there's currently a bug affecting this, so you're really coming off as the ignorant here. Currently in Classic, respective elemental power increase does not increase wand dmg. Whether that's a bug remains a topic with different views.
---
I figured that out, but that doesnt matter to me.
---
What role/spec was the druid doing in the dungeon?  Resto?  Feral dps?
---
I see that bubbler peekin out over there you sly dog
---
I started keeping notes leveling up, but it got pretty lengthy for bad experiences with people. Ninja looters in low level dungeons, people trying to steal things like chests when I was clearly fighting the last mob to get to it, dungeon rage quitters cause healers or tanks were new and learning, etc.
---
Good to hear you‚Äôve had mostly positive experiences though, I‚Äôm hoping all the suffering I did to make it to 60 means I won‚Äôt have any more names to add to my list any time soon lol
---
Okay sweet, thanks for the info
---
&gt; it should be mentioned before starting.
---
I would go one step further. 
---
If you lock for example a 2hand sword, you should tell everyone who could possible need it before they are invited.
---
Don't make a full raid, half of them wait for like 30-60 before the raid is full and then you tell them "oh btw X,Y and Z is locked". 
---
This just wastes everyones time.
---
The question really if you spam it do you get multiple copies for n the debuff because that‚Äôs how you can tell if the exploit been fixed.
---
Unless their big butt does unexpected pulls.
---
The problem is you can't tell which servers are balanced anymore. For what it was worth, the census data showed 90% of all NA PvP realms were significantly dominated by horde. Most transfers were Alliance. Realms like Heartseeker were transferable from the 3 largest, most overwhelmingly horde PvP servers which naturally led to all the alliance flooding into that server. Heartseeker was a good example of how not to handle realm transfers. Now its 90% alliance and Herod, Stalagg, and Skeram are even more fucked than they were before.
---
take the sickness for the quickness
---
Is that the vanilla ui?
---
That or profession components/recipes. Again, you're explicitly running for that one thing.

Well i want a bop/bok i can vanish,evasion or spam faint if i see that i'm close to getting aggro D:

If the healer dies, it's the tank's fault.
---
If the tank dies, it's the healer's fault.

And if the DPS dies, it's their fault.

You say extremely lazy, but you still have to reach far forward to grab your drink, plate and gravy. Tsk, tsk.

You classic players and your BIS items. Back in vanilla, peeps got ‚Äúof the whale‚Äù trash and liked it!
---
Dude, I've got a nearly identical setup! Are you using an old shelf, too?
---
The biggest challenge when ganking a druid is the fact that they can self-heal. Most of the healing a druid has is heals over time rather than burst, and a couple of stacks of wound poison will mean their heals entirely stop working. Additionally, if you've specced improve kick, you wait for them to break form to pop their heal and kick them so they're stuck in humanoid form for 2 seconds. Do that and they drop very quickly.
---
Not paladins

If you can describe your vision for the edit and DM me a link to the footage I could probably whip it up pretty fast for ya.

Not a massive fan of Gnome's but if I were to make one it'd look pretty much like that. Wizardly looking little fella.
---
For some reason lately tanks have gotten the idea that even in start they ought to get first orb at the very least. It‚Äôs pretty bizarre. One even demanded all the green drops. We said nope to him quick and found a more reputable warrior... she still wanted first orb though.
---
NO CHANGES
---
Why did no-one get excited over the real grill?
---
Imagine saying you think you do but you don‚Äôt, and having hundreds of thousands of people play a free knock off version of your mmo, at the state it was in over a decade ago. Then inviting a group of dedicated private server developers to your prestigious headquarters, and asking them how to develop their  own game.  Blizzard hasn‚Äôt known better since 2008.  
---
Ps: remember you have to say blizzard / activision now.
---
I'm not saying it's better than ds/ruin or sm ruin or whatever. I'm saying it's fun, and it does good enough damage. i'm 55 atm and have never had someone complain about 300 dps on bosses in brd. 
---
Haven't had a rogue do more damage than me, either. :)
---
Well, I don't know about you, but I'm selling Savory Deviate Delight, linen &amp; wool, and leather like hotcakes. I'm level 25 and I already have enough for my mount. *shrug*

Beggars are the lowest. Even hookers and drug dealers work for their money.
---
where's the hoj farm
---
What‚Äôd you sell them for out of curiosity?
---
They are the new huntard.
---
Maybe you are the one who is toxic. Supply and demand. The demand for tanks is high. Honestly, so many people in here have tried to explain to you how it works, but you obviously do not get it. That is okay. After a few months, you'll be gone anyway.
---
You are acting like these tanks are being a ninja.. They are asking to reserve an item lol. They can say no. 
---
Again, I could tell instantly you did not play vanilla when you came crying about how tanks have the audacity to inquire about reserving an item.
---
Your attitude itself is toxic, you claim people don't have the right to provide a service in a video game all while requesting something in turn.
---
Nice video...sure it felt great.
---
But Warrior/Mage/Rogue DPS numbers aren't really impressive content.  Vanilla Class Balance in its current state is totally amateurish.
---
I'm just saying the idea that Patchwerk is some sort of hardcore gearcheck is absurd.
---
Geared warriors get to like 4.5-5k
---
If you want a full UI overhaul, check put ElvUI. It is very customizable and super clean

wowhead looter
---
Why are you only like lvl 8 or so
---
A semi-con is that they are (really) much better on alliance due to kings and Fear Ward. It really playas into the Bear‚Äôs weaknesses.
---
Just kicking him wasnt enough. His loot? Lol give me a break. To be worthy of loot you have to contribute positively to the group. That doesn't take much. Literally just attack the skull target 3 seconds after pull and you are contributing massively. Even an afk going person is contributing more. Since at least they dont cause problems.
---
He deserved this. I also made sure that my guild will never group with him again and my friends guild. Thats close to 300 lvl 58+ people. It'll be a lot harder for him to get groups now.
---
Yep. This was why we eventually ended up not allowing lock or hunter pets on Onyxia. If they pulled aggro at the wrong tine, it usually meant a party wipe.
---
You look like a Pomeranian waiting for the mailman.
---
i did it for windfury
---
How difficult do you think finding the point where an item is looted is to a GM?
---
F
---
Servers dead, let it die
---
What? You think those nuggies were cooked in an oven? This PC doubles as a smoker on a good day!
---
Healers can sort that shit out faster than tanks.  "Not running healbot. My focus is on the tank.  You pull aggro, I hope you're a fucking spectacular alchemist."
---
Sorts them quickly.  Had a few healers go hardball up front.  Great instance runs.
---
Imagine challenging a warlock. Especially one that was just nice to you.
---
Well yea. Topic was about the class mounts tho?
---
My cover is blown
---
Can someone please explain what a "white hit" and a "yellow hit" is?
---
It‚Äôs no longer just the Simpsons making predictions
---
is your desk a leaf for a table lmfao
---
That left model doesn't look like anything I've ever seen in WoW...lol no doubting you...Just...wtf is up with that face. The one on the right looks way more like the succy I remember from vanilla.
---
no
---
I get that rules are definitely open to interpretation, but in my opinion, a post saying ‚Äúhey, just a heads up, if you raid with these guys they will most likely be reserving loot, so you prob don‚Äôt want to raid with them‚Äù is not the same as ‚Äúencouraging others to harass individuals or organizations‚Äù.
---
From how they were on release?
---
Why is your mouse mat sideways? Do you usually need to go up and down more than you do left and right?
---
Best advice I can give you is get a mouse for sure.
---
To everyone saying to put them on blast and shit it's not like they denied the loot at the drop. OP left after what sounds like 1 pull and a summon so tbh it doesnt sound like the worst offence considering the raid lead went ahead and warned about the specific loot OP would want and didnt already have. 
---
It still sucks going the whole way to the dungeon but still it would be entirely different story if a piece actually dropped and they hit you with the by the way at that point.
---
Oh fuck now you got me stressing! I always smoke joints right in front of my laptop lol
---
&lt;Nagas with Attitiude&gt;
---
But the title says "without changing..." so no it wasn't the point.
---
it doesn't pull ahead single target until you have much better gear than is available at the moment

Kill them and make a horcrux. Hahahaha. Filthy horde had it coming.
---
Did they put him there in cata or something? I quit shortly after wrath launched
---
I feel you, some people just can‚Äôt really look at the situation and just want to do the ‚Äúfastest‚Äù and optimal way of getting the job done. It seems like aoe farming dungeons is just popular and just people keep wanting to try without looking at a situation rationally. People gotta just learn how to work in a group with what they have. Popularity will be played out over getting a job done. Just pull less and get the job done and consider everyone else‚Äôs hp/mp when moving forward. It honestly just feels like they were noobs lol.

Same. But 15 years ain't that bad.
---
God pls dont let that be spread, I can already see green tanks that want a fortune to " tank" any high lvl instance and cant even hold aggro from one mob, while we wait like 5 minutes.... god pls no!
---
Nahh this happens when you attack the gryphon master. he keeps on summoning tons of Wyvern.
---
There must some copycats or a sister guild on Smolderweb then.
---
This is what I‚Äôve been doing, working out pretty well so far.
---
Had a mage calling me every word in the dictionary while doing SFK, because after I told him not to use aoe as soon as I charge in he did and agrod every single mob causing him to die. 
---
Then at the end Robes of Arugal dropped, I selected need. And won! Sold it to a vendor for 20 silver.
---
oops
---
This. As you get experience and start to feel out threat mechanics you'll start to push that limit eeeever so slightly. The best part of playing a Warlock is maximizing your potential with the razor thin risk-reward threshold of tapping your health to mana! When you take an active role in regulating your health to mana, and vice versa, you find your role in a group is a lot more fun than you thought.

You‚Äôre either extraordinarily single, or have a really awesome significant other. Either way, I‚Äôm all for it. 
---
Well done.
---
Seems like you can just hide inside of instance portals and fight guards while completely avoiding other players.  If PvP which avoids other players is prohibited, it logically follows this should be too.
---
Really?  You decided against Shagnaros?

The content and vocal delivery was pretty solid. There were a couple moments of blank transition in the video though I noticed. Keep up the good work!
---
Basically means, in so far as is possible, the purest form of the game. 
---
  I don't have an issue with extra content (if Blizz develop it), but the constant dumbing down of content with each expansion is for me unacceptable.   I like the classic mechanics because it can be both challenging and rewarding.  The ethos is different.   It's about regular challenge rather than regular reward.   I like that.
---
White hits are regular autoattack hits. Yellow hits are any ability hits. It refers to the color on the scrolling combat text of abilites/autoattacks.
---
They did that in vanilla too, it has to do with the pet being programmed to automatically run behind the mob sometimes

---
To be fair, it looks like he does have some AQ20 gear mixed in there helping out, but he still has 8k health and gains extra dodge in cat form.  33% armor reduction does mean that he is taking roughly double damage, but its entirely on the heals during the calls anyway.
---
A 40 man raid with 1 fucking shaman? holy SHIT
---
same goes for me.
---
You need gnomish active, it's in the tooltip.
---
yeah you are, but i wouldn‚Äôt worry. i‚Äôve finally landed on my main (rogue) and am currently sitting at lvl 15. haven‚Äôt been able to find an rfc group just yet, however, don‚Äôt worry. those people looking for rfd+ aren‚Äôt going anywhere any time soon, and i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find an rfc group soon enough, just a little bit of patience is needed.
---
don‚Äôt worry about falling behind unless you‚Äôre a hardcore raider :)

Thanks for the feedback! I'm going to make sure to smooth out those transitions with my latest one I'm working on. I appreciate it! :)

Pretty much half of Skeram's Alliance went there. Same with Stalagg and Herod. Allowing THREE already imbalanced, Horde dominated servers to transfer to Heartseeker was a huge mistake by Blizzard. Literally all the Alliance flooded there. Run to Org on Heartseeker and you'll see 6k items on the Horde AH as opposed to 26k+ on the Alliance AH. Heartseeker is fucked just as bad as Skeram and Stalagg.
---
It was smolderweb. I don't think they got to thrall.

I highly appreciate the name "Noobface", and congratulations on your first WoW Classic mount. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

No, I only ever played WOW on my laptop and I never let anyone else play. Also, my brother who made his account the same day as me, has not been banned even though he also played in Europe for a bit and now he's back in NA. I don't believe my account got hacked. Everything seemed normal. I was so shocked to find out I was banned for thirty days.

Thanks for finding that post! I remembered what had happened, but I hadn't actually read through that thread in over a decade. Nice little walk down memory lane.
---
People will leave you alone as an affliction lock in Classic, especially if you run with a priest. Already at level 25, people just pass on by most of the time. We used to take lock/priest duos into 20-29 twink WSG or AB and just melt faces.

You're so stupid it's hilarious.

Indeed. Tanks also can't AoE tank. Warriors can stance dance a little and get off Thunderclap, but not on trash that will rip you a new one if you aren't in Defensive stance. People aren't really used to tight DPS timers either unless they have been running mythic mode raids. Class balance is poor, so there's a distinct possibility that you will get to raid for one boss a night, because X number of class Y are needed and that's not you so tough titties even if the gear you want/need for getting into the next raid comes from a boss you can't get invited for. The hard limits on DoT effects on the enemy mean that you may not be allowed to use half your spellbook and doing so can cause a wipe because your raid couldn't pull off enough damage.
---
Then there is some subtle shit, too. Twiddling people between different groups within the raid can change your overall damage output. A raid leader misplacing a few people and people getting incorrect buffs can mean less DPS, less HPS, and shitty, painful night of raiding.
---
Like you said, prepping for a raid is a bigger deal now. People in my old retail guild basically slack off with regards to proper consumables. That isn't an option in Classic. Neither is not having that high end weapon buff that will cost you a metric fuckton to get because the pattern is rare.
---
It's difficult, but a different kind of difficult.
---
My guild on Horde- Felstriker is Safeword Fortitude
---
You can't just isolate a roll and say it is completely unrelated to every other roll in the past. Statistically if you want to get the same # twice in a row it is exponentially higher odds. Specifically because WoW uses computers and Random Number Generators, its even harder to roll the same number twice in a row. RNG has always been fickle, its quite hard to tell a computer to give you an unpredictable response.
---
What was the post on relationship advice?

So, vanilla then? I mean, TBC came with a bunch of lovely new toys and SL/SL, but Vanilla locks were and are, beasts.
---
How do you reach the food?? Gf?
---
Depends on the BoE.
---
If a 500g epic BoE item drops, I am needing on it and telling everyone to need on it. I *do need 500g*, probably more than you need a 5% dps increase anyway.
---
Now, if it's some low level BoE blue that sells for maybe 5-10g, yeah, just let the dude have it.
---
I have a one bedroom with my wife and 80lbs lab. It's all about compromises. This is what I do in my free-time when I can. School, Relationships, then gaming. Sometimes I get a little excessive with my game time and she let's me know. Nothing a little communication can't solve.
---
As for camping in front of the TV? Yeah, only when she is out of town would I even attempt something like this.
---
Be a dwarf so they show on your map. If you're not a druid you will spend a stupid amount of time trying to find them

I'm currently 56 sm/ruin specced and also use VW, which most ppl seem to disagree with, but I've actually found great success with it. This is what i do: Send vw in 2-3 mobs, open with immolate&gt;coa&gt;corruption on mob 1, coa&gt;corruption&gt;fear mob 2, coa&gt;corruption mob 3, back to mob 1 spam shadowbolt&gt;drain soul, keep corruption up on other mobs and shadowbolt&gt;drain soul others. After each fight, I tap to ~50% mana, bandage myself and vw and keep going. Only have to eat/drink after about 10-15 mobs in a row and get some pretty good xp from it. This is my first lock as well so i could be doing something wrong but it seems pretty smooth to me
---
If you're drinking out of range of the moves you're doing it wrong.
---
Also, every healer I've had tells at me to go while they drink because there's little point in the entire group standing there watching his mama bar.  We don't need to be at 100%, we just need to not be at 0%.
---
how?
---
Looks like a psin in the ass to get out of. Not really lazy so much as comfy. Lazy would mean you can get up and out with zero effort
---
Not with these millennial kids. 
---
It‚Äôs always someone else‚Äôs problem, never theirs, so teamwork in pugs now is a rarity.
---
Okay, but does it work in Seal form?
---
Luxurious
---
You lack empathy. I was unfairly double teamed by higher levels by some egomaniacal afk player who must have just gotten back and whined to guildies. Yes I did camp him as I killed quest mobs but he could have tried to 1v1 me.
---
Notice how all the stories of pvp cowardice comes from the alliance side. Notice how no one irl is proud to say they are alliance but all the cool people like me will say for the horde with pride? It‚Äôs because Alliance only fight when they have the numbers and refuse fair pvp.
---
In a perfect world, sure, but in reality some BoE are worth alot of gold and should be rolled on by all party members unless otherwise agreed upon
---
I currently do not have a PC, only an outdated half working macbook and I will dream about having your life tonight.

Is that in an inn or not?

The 2% crit trinket is better afaik
---
Does anyone have any tips for dealing with the Garr add banishes (particularly early banish breaks) without the ability for focus frames. Is there an addon or weakaura that will  /say announce if it breaks early for example?
---
&gt; The difference is no one is working for no reward if you just avoid people who want your gear. That's a huge difference, man.
---
No one is working for no reward in a reserved group, either, given that's properly communicated. If there was no reward for them then they wouldn't join the group, plain and simple.
---
As a mage I just continue to drink while the party pulls. I haven't met anybody who cares
---
Lol dude, I never bought an account or paid someone to level mine. 
---
I just dont care if someone who has extra money but not extra time buys a lvl 60. Its not like blizzard is just instant spawning 60s... someone is hand leveling these.
---
Oh ya, that is lil chi.
---
May she rip. She laid on my lap all those months and months of playing.

---
32‚Äù 1080p masterrayce
---
Anything good in that lake?
---
It's because when you have a slower weapon, each point of attack power increases your weapon damage by a greater amount.
---
It's the same amount of total time spent drinking and running but you spend less time not being able to heal your group after you stand up which is why OP is doing it wrong.
---
You clearly haven‚Äôt run dungeons as a lvl 20-30 warrior.
---
Lol, and to be fair, Warlocks are just about the only thing that should be killing a rogue.
---
i have started doing this but only first orb reserved 
---
it's decent gold but you can still get shit groups or sometimes no orbs
---
Nah, there are a lot of good reasons for the rules.
---
First is it prevents Ninjas. Whenever an expensive BOE item drops a player would/could delay their own roll until everyone greeds and then they need. Who cares if they get kicked, they just ninja'd a 200g item!
---
Second is upgrades. If an item can be taken and sold for 30g, you can then use that 30g to buy your own upgrade. So really anyone can use a BOE to get their actual upgrade.
---
Third is another style of ninja... There are actually players who will unequip rare items and put some trash thing in there so that if it drops they can "need" it, but no one really checks to make sure they actually equip it and they'll go and sell it.
---
Try davinci resolve if you want some good free editing software
---
I‚Äôm pugs, unless your being generous , yes.
---
Greens are no joke. ...of Wrath and ...of Healing greens are sometimes the largest amount of spell power/healing power available.
---
You are not wrong. That's absolutely a trash move. Glad you found out before doing an entire raid for nothing.
---
This is right around where I am currently in the state of wow. Had a shit day cuz I just wanted to quest and got fabled multiple times. It‚Äôs about to be open season

Why missiles? Why? :(

People have been very helpful, getting each stack roughly 85s-1g a stack with direct trades or CoD‚Äôs when they want to help me reach my goal. I buy a good amount off the AH too if it‚Äôs under 1g 15s a stack.I think I‚Äôm lookin at around somewhere near 400ish more stacks till I‚Äôm there.

So this is the person I keep killing in PvP that can barely turn around.

Just grind the elementals for the cresting and thundering things for the cyclonian quest. They're worth 50s each and sometimes will drop off every other mob. Took me 4 hours to get the 30g I needed for my mount.

Grind it up and smoke it I guess.

Thanks for the PSA Brother

Nope, you never use renew. It is more efficient to just throw out one or two heals a pull for the tank on a standard pack.
---
Otherwise, bubble isn't supposed to be for stopping pushback on your dps and to give you time to wind up a big heal if they need it, not for mana efficiency.
---
Demonology had a lot of good gimmicks early in WotLK when you could abuse the AoE damage reduction to have Blueberry maintank some fights.

It does not give multiple copies of the debuff, no.

Gehennas EU still has queues every single day starting in the early afternoon during the week and around noon in the weekends. During peak hours the queue is well over 3 hours still. Some servers may be bleeding members but the top servers are still as packed as they've always been and they will continue to be so.
---
I will have that hat. I must have that hat. This time, the hat will be mine.

I fully recognize speed-running as a legitimate alternative mode of play in overall principle. I think it's great for lots of different games, and it definitely has its place in WoW. The Mythic Dungeon system and the MDI are great examples of this.
---
However, I don't think it has a place in Classic WoW's first tier of raiding. MC is far too mechanically simplistic and it's on the extreme low end of repeatability due to the vanilla raid lockout system. I think complex mechanics that allow for creativity and easily replayable content are key elements to make a speed-running mode a viable method of playing a game in this "out of the box" way. 
---
I can see that my tone in my previous comment was a bit dismissive and could be interpreted as failing to recognize the legitimacy of speed-running on the whole. For that, I apologize.
---
I don't make the rules. Maybe it's not, but I read these things a lot and they end up gone. Sometimes.
---
man has priorities
---
nothing stops you from juggling multiple mobs, especially once you start getting +damage on your gear and it only takes 2-3 dots to actually kill something.
---
You actually can avoid all the damage.
---
Wouldn't it be better to just quietly fade away and let all the players who are ganking lowbies slowly realise they invested their time into a dead server?
---
Not only a dead server, one they killed themselves.
---
&gt; nobody has that kind of cash lying around (that they want to spend).   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Noone
---
you srs? plenty of people do lol. im 52 and have 225g, and i just spent 120g on my robe of winter night + enchant + a shadow dam cloak(both i'll use into MC) and i'm not even that rich. at 60 there are multiple classes that can farm mara for 40-60g/hr. 
---
i dont agree with selling the bow for that much(right now) but saying people don't have 75g to drop on a dime is completely false.
---
Sargeras? I played on Sargeras and it was like that. Literal hell. As a Horde I was constantly hunted any time I went anywhere because I was just like an amusement to all the Alliance running around who had probably never seen a Horde before.
---
I made 62g from 40-46 from quests and just leveling. Dont stress the money making
---
Lazy? My dude that‚Äôs badass. Kudos.
---
Yeah, everyone knows that only millennial kids play WoW classic!! 
---
Sorry, seems like you're just projecting a bit with that comment.

You should make a new character and actually do the content, by the time you're done a new phase will be out.

Please listen to OP and buy my Mooncloth bags.

That cat looks sick

I mean the whole post is that joke, so I guess you were too late?
---
Oh lawd he comin

I think people will still be playing classic in a year, only if due to the staggered release schedule of the endgame content.
---
Most of those scrub players aren't likely to be reading this sub, just so you know.  People here are generally clued up.

Mmm, I had a recliner for Vanilla. Seems my office needs some adjustments... 10/10 would hang out.

Thanks for censoring the names Drizzels but you left your guild tabard open, thanks for the account.

Just do dungeons. Whenever you have a few hours to commit, find a group to spam a certain dungeon a few times.
---
He was playing resto in the dungeon, mostly because he wasn't a high enough level to play as a dps in the party. Originally I was going to be the healer, but he wanted to come with us, so I took the dps role
---
If you play on the top 3 servers everything will be fine, but if you were one of those dumbasses who  picked a medium or lowish high pop realm you're pretty much fucked.
---
Something is missing..do you has plush pillows?
---
Lol it‚Äôs ok I‚Äôve used steam app on my iPhone before with Xbox one controller it works alright for basic tasks on wow works even better for GTAV
---
Yes by far it has!  Though I wish I had more time to play still having a blast
---
You can scale/jump up the wall outside ironforge main gate to the left of the gate
---
Wall jumping
---
Yes they are
---
&gt;For Warrior specific your main button bar should be shifting for each stance also so I try to keep only buttons on the main bar that can be used for that stance
---
I'm thinking to put shared abilities on bar i one so they don't move when I change, then bind bar two to be activated with the buttons set to the main bar by default (1-9). Then when I switch the "r" button can trigger overpower or revenge (on bar one), depending on my stance, while 5 can always be heroic strike (on bar two)
---
Yeah, on the current drop tables. Later (as at that time) it comes from Emperor.
---
If classic is the only game you're buying a pc for then don't go overboard.  It's not a demanding game.
---
If you were thinking of getting back into pc gaming in general though, welcome back.
---
i get to motion sick with SoT sadly :(
---
I don't think most came from retail, so they can't go back.
---
Picture is so dark I barely saw him at first.  You need to find a lighter scene.
---
ook nobody said shit about nightfall. people go sm/ruin, which they either have nightfall or they don't, and I didn't say anything about it
---
and I stick by sm/ds, because you do not have the crit chance or hit chance to take advantage of ruin when just spamming shadow bolts vs. a flat damage percentage. and even in your case it's unlikely you were anywhere near your mages and hunters right now as warlocks suffer greatly before ZG.
---
if your raid team runs with full world buffs all the time that's great for you, but your experience is NOT the norm.
---
I just respawned in when I heard "I've got you in my sights" and just about shit myself like "WHEN DID THEY GET A 76????"
---
Then realised it was you, ya dick. üòÇüòÇüòÇ 
---
This was fun. Thanks.
---
Ruin is not at all worth it for leveling. 
---
Let‚Äôs assume you have a 3% crit chance while leveling before endgame gear. Ruin thus gives you a 3% chance to do 100% more damage on that crit. 
---
It‚Äôs about a 3% total overall dps increase IF you‚Äôre only casting spells that can crit. However, about 70-80% (conservatively) of your damage leveling is from DOTs/drain/wand. 
---
So basically it‚Äôs only a 3% increase in damage on 20% of your dps, which is a .6% dps increase overall. Hard pass.
---
Look at the server list the next time you wanna log on.
---
There are no dead servers. I was on at 1AM the other night and not a single server was under medium. Only 7 were medium. The rest were either full or High.
---
There's no real reason to be stuck on a server you can't play on.
---
Holy hell I forgot all about getting there back in the day.
---
Hey bud love the set up you got there and absol-fucking-lutely love the top shelf lazyboy you sit in
---
Quite clean albeit a little cluttered down the bottom.
---
As others have suggested, you should consider getting something like Better Align to get that minimap and bars centered up.
---
Also suggest Masque to be able to reskin the action bars to something a little nicer, just makes them looked polished.. [https://imgur.com/eNiCPtv](https://imgur.com/eNiCPtv)
---
I think these people make these comments because they want to make themselves seem smarter than the unsophisticated masses. It's  a mild form of bullying so they can feel cooler than someone. I mean, as if we weren't all big fucking nerds for even being here. Sad.
---
If you need to reserve stuff, why are you puging? I'll never understand some people
---
Well, not to be rude or whatever, but people have been playing classic since 2004.
---
So, probably?
---
Are you buying every single skill available at the trainer? If you are doing so, then stop. A lot of skills you don't need while levelling.
---
Do you loot everything on a mob and do you have big bags? Almost every item in the game has some level of value either to the AH or to a vendor.
---
It is
---
I feel like they will merge realms eventually right? Or atleast the option for server transfers because "more money"
---
Beat the shit outta you.
---
And it totally isn't someone using a voice changer! Promise!
---
I think many will be gone. Honestly I don't see myself playing in 6 months. But I don't think they're going back to retail
---
Lol what I can turn quite fine thank you very much
---
If people have a massive level advantage over you at lvl 58 you're probably in the wrong game :)
---
I was asking about downranking because literally every trash healer that comes on reddit to bitch and moan tries to downrank before having enough sp and thus run out of mana all the time.
---
I just get so triggered when people are awful and then come and whine about everyone else not wanting to stoop to their awfulness.
---
400 more stacks?! You mean 400 more in total right...
---
Are you using a weakaura to show your range to target or something? I ended up janking up something of my own but it bugs out a lot, so any reference could be useful to me.
---
So, is the range-to-target from a weakaura or some other addon?
---
Tim Hortons
---
Its insulting that guy is named after a shitty whiskey company.
---
If you don't need it, then yes.
---
I dont play retail.  Classic only.  And regardless of it dying down I'll still prolly be in classic.
---
Cannot claim that which one does not have.
---
Thanks lol
---
Don‚Äôt go afk in a pvp server and stand in my path. I still 1v1ed him and made sure to teach him this lesson. Sounds like Godking is not a god nor a king but a pvp noob
---
Truly a king of comfort.
---
Your a loser. Shhhhh.
---
A heal Paladin wants dps plate too.
---
I hate people who reserve items. By principle I never join those groups even if I don't even need the item being reserved.
---
If you invite someone to pull his weight and put in equal effort as you through the dungeon, then he deserves just as much a chance at loot as you do.
---
How do you guys function with so few buttons.
---
Depends how quickly the issue is reported. If right away, then pretty quickly. If it was reported hours or a day later, it may take some time to sort through the logs and also chat logs. 
---
Investigations are often pretty time consuming. Again, I dont know what kind of system they use nor their sop. I am only speaking from my investigative experience.
---
What's your route then? I circle winterspring and Un'goro. Comb the caves in Silithus, and then the outer rim of eastern / western plaguelands.
---
Yeah lol ..
---
Ever dipped a Wendy's nug in Nacho Cheese?
---
Taco Bell across the street.
---
Went all out
---
What do you mean go back to retail? Most of us can't stand retail and haven't/ won't play BFA.
---
Pulls aren't going to go wrong 100% of the time.
---
I can generally hover around 60-80% mana while chain pulling with a 2h tank. A bad pull might bring me down to 20-30, but I'll easily recover by just not dpsing on the next pack and instead be drinking.
---
You can absolutely be certain that anyone that comes to complain about healing on reddit is just a bad healer.
---
Beats me. What's a better opener? All I know is with the current meta, it puts me far enough away from the blood thirsty mages that I can actually build some threat before they go nuts. Open to better ideas though. Just learning as I go
---
We will see who is laughing when my credit rating in the community is pristine while you are known as the gnome troll who griefs people
---
Hahaha, was waiting for this comment.
---
Sounds like you need to escape your basement and get some fresh air once in a while.
---
You and your try hard guild can do your own thing. 
---
I do agree with griefers. Getting camped by ?? Level players is anti fun
---
I don't know what you mostly do in wow, but you should post screens hots of this mid raid so people can judge how practical it actually is. A practical raid ui for me will always be better than a pretty looking one outside of raid
---
Dude give it a break, it‚Äôs just a game.
---
I never understood how people can play games on those lazy sofa-like chairs.
---
I find computer chairs are ideal because they are less comfortable  and better for posture. I used to use my lazy chair but it makes me go to sleep, and I find I can't maintain a good posture with them. With computer chairs being less comfortable I'm more likely to stand up and do something else from time to time to avoid hurting myself. Just my 2 cents dude, I love the tidy and neatly presented set up with the nice touch of old mate colonel.
---
Cheers big ears
---
While I generally agree that this works as you can drink in range while the tank dips down to like 30%, pop a PW:S on him, and top everyone off quickly and efficiently, this can go very, very wrong. 
---
Many times I've run into range and clicked my water to drink only to get hit by a whirlwind/cleave, shout, or something else to pull me into combat and stop my drink. Now I can't even blow any "extra" mana if shit goes wrong. So I'm more of a fan of drinking and running. At least I can blow a little extra to catch up or if things go south rather than trickling heals in as I try to regen. So many time I've been pulled into combat early so I don't get to drink at all or hit by some sort of ability that interrupts my drink. 
---
Seriously the worst feeling as a healer is to know that the pull would have been very easy had the party given you 30 seconds to top yourself off. But no, they'd rather try to save 15 seconds here and there because it "feels faster". Well I hate to break it to you, but when you pull when I'm at 20% and we die - all of the time savings are lost due to the run back. So just keep in mind the more difficult trash pulls and let the healer get a bit of mana before you go nuts. Is the run back and repair bill really worth having to not sit on your hands for a few extra mins per dungeon?
---
Same token. If you notice a lot of people in the raid are the same guild especially the RL my first comment would be ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the deal with loot?‚Äù
---
Telling someone they're doing a bad job of making a counterpoint isn't a personal attack
---
when i was level 12, rfc was the only thing people were doing in there
---
Yes ret pallys are a shit spec, I didn't think that was contested at all.
---
Whenever I see a lock life tap, I just hit them with a renew and leave their fate in there own hands.
---
I don‚Äôt notice any at all seems to be solid
---
PvP servers in classic are way more popular than they were in actual vanilla, and there's no battlegrounds yet, so of course the 60s are going around ganking...
---
He‚Äôs an idiot because that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about. And you‚Äôre stupid too.
---
And fear. Heal and fear and that‚Äôs enough. And more dps late game so we don‚Äôt get warrior envy.

Go learn fishing and get stoned and fish. So relaxing.
---
Have 2 friends that are playing for their first time. They are having more fun than ever and feel so rewarded to complete minuscule things that they otherwise would have never carred about in other games like getting blue gear or completing a quest.
---
Why, is that a crime?
---
Well I tried my best
---
Fuck off chud.
---
The rogue is to the right of the mage getting ready to gank them.
---
I wanted to stop and waste 5 minutes of my life to let you know this was one of the most retarded pointless posts on this sub that I have seen. Crying about getting killed by two skulls while killing an afk player and then goes on to demand people blacklist them...lmao.
---
aint nobody got time for that. This tank aggro circlejerk is getting boring. You can dps like a madman in low lvl dungeons, no one dies, the run just goes faster.
---
Thanks üòÅ
---
Yeah, 35g for crusader is stupid money. I get it for rare enchants like +healing but everyone and their mother has crusader.
---
Came here to say this.  And welcome home!
---
Noobface? Really ?
---
Should I use catform as soon as I hit 20 as a druid, or wait until I get rake at level 24? I've heard opinions from both sides and I'm curious.
---
So, The Forsaken?
---
I love it. Looks super cozy, and I play on a similarly sized tv.
---
Don't say that, the Boomkin are listening.
---
Can confirm. I have several Venezuelans contracted with me and some of them said they were only making around $10 a week where they were before. Money is very very hard to come by there.
---
He didn't say that though?  He said the exact opposite, naxx is easier than current LFR.
---
exactly... for 35g I would expect you to fly out to the dungeon I am in to enchant my weapon for me... 5g is a decent tip if they have mats and come to you so you arent inconvenienced.
---
I love how everyone is assuming the OP is the buyer because it's impossible to not see it as being unreasonably priced.
---
Oh well I'm sure rogue got his enchant and carried on
---
I mean it does negate damage in a small window when you vanish. For example you can vanish pyroblast and it wont do damage.
---
But I doubt that's what he tried to do
---
Thank you! I will definitely look into these and better align is a life saver.
---
I'm level 43. Also I've got a similar setup where I use my laptop from the my couch and watch/listen to TV or streams/youtube
---
It‚Äôs a lvl 9 character but also macros
---
Undead raptor mount is a goal I‚Äôve set for myself for classic, currently level 52. The rest of my spare gold till 60 is going towards the runecloth to get exalted. I‚Äôve done every quest available to me with dark spear rep so far, but still going to be over 400 stacks of runecloth to finish it out... wish me luck lol.
---
They did
---
You killed an afk player then cry you get jumped by their guildies... What are you 12?
---
And poisons.  But it doesn't really matter since the druid can heal.  The best chance is a well timed Kidney Shot when they transform to heal.
---
Need a corsair lapdog..
---
The sticker on the tower, should‚Äôve known.
---
I haven't played one, but based on what I've read online the only good pally in vanilla is heal spec.
---
do you pick up the nuggies with your feet?
---
No. Not you. Never.  
---
But yet your quick to jump on that defensive...
---
Sorry if this has been bought up before, but with mining is it working as intended to commonly only get a 1 hit Small Thorium and a 2 hit Rich Thorium node? 1 hits rarely if ever happen with Mithril.
---
Or the word ‚Äúcrit‚Äù
---
It is.
---
I'll buff just about anything that walks by.
---
god, do people really think like this
---
Which raptor?
---
Obviously they can‚Äôt remove it now, and I don‚Äôt even want them to until they can fix the overpopulation issues, but that doesn‚Äôt mean people can‚Äôt point out a bad decision when we see one. 
---
Honestly, I can‚Äôt even think of a way for Blizzard to fix this problem, besides forcibly splitting servers which would cause even more drama and complaints than they are currently dealing with.
---
Saw a guy advertising for 10g fee
---
A lot of these guild names just aren't unique. I've actually seen some guild names, such as &lt;ego&gt; on 5 different servers
---
No, anyone who rolls a gnome is 12. Seriously they deserve to be camped kek
---
Now I gotta see
---
Oh god please let this be a troll post. If not, everyone should look at this post as a warning for what you can become if you take this game too seriously.
---
This probably won‚Äôt be used for raids. I just enjoy messing with my UI while leveling.
---
Kick: uses another school of magic
---
Gouge: well ok I guess, you can't kill someone during gouge

Cheap shot: Blink

Proceed to kill rogue.

Honestly, how tf do you remember that? Not trying to be mean. It was 15 years ago...
---
I don‚Äôt play on your server, but yeah I‚Äôd have probably laughed. 
---
Tell me, did you let general know you shat your pants? Also why didn‚Äôt you sort yourself out and take a break after soiling yourself? Instead of letting yourself get camped or Griefed by these dudes? 
---
Not to mention, most of us aren‚Äôt communists and we definitely are not the Fucken Borg, so toss your collective garbage in the bin.
---
Why is this something people complain so much? I've been in groups who knew how to play the game (HOT the warlock after pulls, mages evo, healer only spending mana on heals) and finished dungeons with insane efficiency and only eating/drinking 3-4 times the entire way. Ive also been in groups that complained about things like healing warlocks and spent 4 hours in maraudon drinking after 2 mob pulls.
---
nice name, may earthmother guide you
---
Even if I don't need any of the shit they are reserving for their sorry selves, I would bail.
---
How much of your money do you give to people who need it more than you do? Not as much as you could, I reckon, since you seem to be paying for a WoW sub.
---
 "pay me for water or get your own"   
---
These are the fuckers that really piss me off, you're a mage for fuck sake, your a dime a dozen and odds are the next one won't an anti social asshole demanding payment for a free resource.
---
The only thing I would urge you to not do too much is respec too often. Every time you respec, the cost goes up, and it gets quite expensive! Everything else, have fun!!

This comment only existed for 4 min and somehow it‚Äôs still incredibly underrated.
---
well druid cat bear and healer is fine , i think cat takes some skill to be good though , 3 good options is better than most classes
---
unless you are using your feet to eat in that setup, it doesnt look lazy
---
Why even bother getting mad the that seller was asking for an unreasonable amount. These type of sellers always fade away and do not progress. 
---
I am sure you just reported what you are looking for an found someone not retarded for five gold lol.
---
If you switch the axe and the armor, that's my experience
---
Well, because I did scholomance every day after school for over a year. When it finally dropped - and I won! - it was a memorable moment.
---
Now I just assume everything is both.
---
Cookie cutter also implies that you'll see a lot of identical builds. Once you see a class and you know exactly how they've spent their talent points, they are cookie cutter.
---
Local defense, world defense, guild. That's how some good world pvp gets started.
---
Idk if mine is more lazy or not but I just use a MacBook and a Naga in my bed most of the time.
---
Either Swift olive or blue, haven‚Äôt decided yet.
---
My dude.
---
It's not so much about some people complaining about past mistakes, clearly Blizzard failed to realize how many people would play. Most people against layering are calling for it to straight up be removed now which is ridiculous.
---
This worked until the fundraisers started carrying around card readers that plug into their phones. Now I whip out my phone and pretend I'm on a phone call when I walk past them.
---
I wasn't stating an order, I was merely stating a rogues toolkit for their defense.
---
I could have reported Trumphater for t-bagging my corpse. I took the high road. I could have reported my supposed friends on the horde for ridiculing me for having an accident... I took the high road. God will and has blessed me because in my life I always take the high road.
---
I don't see how the rogue would feel any better about having to ask to join and only then finding out the group isn't taking any more people who want to roll on a Dal'Rend's or whatever. 
---
Why wouldn't they want you to just say so up front and not waste everyone's time?
---
Cheap shot Into gouge, so when they blink the stun they will still be gouged after
---
Yikes dude. You seem oddly aggressive about this game. Relax my man. It really is just a game.
---
No class is bad, plenty of specs are is how I've heard it summed up.
---
You'd be surprised how much money you can make with fishing, I'm level 25 with 35 gold
---
I love that
---
Thank you. It shows a ton of useful detail.
---
Oh I guess in Arathor? I thought blizzard never clarified where human settlements actually came from.
---
stfu stop crying and snitching
---
Yup. If I remember well, you go there on a quest on retail with an airplane to kill some dark iron dwarves or something, don't know if the quest is the same on classic
---
Boomers....
---
Right? Back in the day when I first started playing WoW consumed my life. Girlfriend broke up with my, abandoned most of my friends, did the hermit life outside of work. Pretty much no-life'd everything.
---
Now it's a lot healthier. Priorities always have to stay straight, especially if I fear I fall into those habits again.
---
You're ageist sir have fun getting abused in the nursing home
---
That's the wrong way of looking at it. Most Alliance I've encountered that I helped out would just /cheer or /wave me. When you kill alliance when they're low you don't give them the chance to see if they're nice. It just perpetuates opportunistic killings.
---
Scrolling though his profile. I am certain it is genuine..... Just FYI he is not in a fun place in life
---
I'm not too stubborn to try retail, I just havent played wow in a long time and the nostalgia of vanilla got me on the classic hype. I'm not super interested in seeing how wow has progressed since then, so I'm not going to give retail a try. Partly because I've heard so many bad things about retail and partly because I wasnt planning on playing wow until classic came out, so why try retail now?
---
Mage always wins that fight if they are equally skilled players.
---
didn't play wow high the first time around. haven't really played in a couple years.
---
much improved, yes.
---
60%*

I like Desolace? I guess I'm just weird. STV smells of death. Which is saying something because Desolace literally has a Kodo graveyard.
---
Im drawing a fat blank here, whats that chest piece? uldaman drop right?

I've had way too many conversations similar to "I've got 3k gold in my bank", "and how much of that have you been able to sell?" "...."

There's gonna be so much storage rot considering how many people have farmed up expecting the market sustain demand forever.

What is even happening in that subreddit?
---
There‚Äôs 3 kinds of people in the world. The first group is also the largest: People who don‚Äôt play Tera. The second group is people who play Tera, but do not play the loli faction. I don‚Äôt think we need to talk about the third group.
---
lmao kronos still pays people for this shit
---
You're a animal. I just got my first 20g and I'm level 30. Im trying to learn TSM but its so confusing.
---
Wait. Wendy's chicken in KFC gravy with a mug of coffee? TF kind of pregnancy level craving is this?
---
How's that related though? Sure some people will have multiple pieces. Especially on less popular classes (a druid just got 4 pieces in one raid today because he was the only one). But do you actually see people prioritizing raid spots based on gear?
---
It's so frustrating when you hit a stone wall at support.  When I was playing LoL years ago suddenly all champions I purchased but didn't have a skin for disappeared from my account as well as all match history with those champions. Weirdest glitch ever but support would not believe me.  I was playing wukong alot and he was removed so no match history but tons of mastery points. I presented this evidence and they doubled down saying the mastery points were the bug.  I never played again and don't regret it.  If I were you I would cancel my WoW sub. Apparently to Blizzard you're not even worth an explanation.

Should I increase the speed limit for each id sent message to the looking for group channel?
---
To me it's just a reboot.  If wow 2 had come out or something I would have come back for that instead of classic.  I hadn't played since wrath of the liche king.
---
Many times I had thought about it, I loved the game and missed it but needed a break with a new job at the time. After some years off even if i thought about playing, i would also think of all the content i missed and as each expansion makes the previous one irrelevant, how do i jump to the newest expansion having missed the story, the changes in the world, the changes just to regular gameplay?  I couldn't find an answer to that so I never came back.  There needs to be a hard reboot every so often to let people come in on equal footing with 15 year vets.  Classic is that reboot for me.  It had everything I remember the game being.  I can't jump to retail, like I said, missed all the story and all the changes make it feel like a different game after all that time off.  I would rather like a wow2 so everyone gets to experience a new world for the first time again, none of this meta this or that, instead everyone trying to find what works best and learning new fights with no info to go on.
---
Wow classic is a reboot for me.
---
Yup this is absolutely true. Reserving is only fair if every member of the group is told ahead of time
---
I started using cat at 20 and liked it much more. It feels much quicker to kill a target.
---
Your wife deciding what you do with a part of your free time is an important part of any healthy marriage lol.
---
Go smokeless dude, great way to keep gaming and cut a few death sticks out of your life.
---
Hm I'd be interested to see if that's true. Lots of more realms opened up, so I'm sure the servers have thinned out. Also, people are probably regulating now much they are playing vs the launch rush to play nonstop. I'm sure there are significantly less players than at launch but it would be interesting to see exactly how many less.
---
Oh man wait until they change it so it drops off of emperor hahahaha

Beats me, I play deep Frost or Arc/Frost. He seems to enjoy it; after all, isn't that what playing video games is all about?

If enough people report it he'll get DCD

ima rogue and imo roll awAy bruther

it's a fucking game lmao let's have fun
---
Potion, watch again.
---
The avg alliance player
---
Liking something is all the reason you need to play it. Some people are not motivated purely by the desire to compete.
---
At 60 yeah, but before then it's fine. Most people are in leveling specs that aren't ideal for pvp either so it usually evens out.
---
And if you're on a pvp server, all zones are gonna have some sort of ganking, but Hillsbrad is a fucking blood bath. Same with STV. At least on my server. I've leveled through both zones just fine but there were times I wanted to throw my keyboard through my screen. But it's a pvp server, it's all part of it.
---
 I'll get my revenge.... someday....
---
I think the training is the cheap part. The mounts themselves cost a ton. I think 10g for normal training, 100g for epic. But 90g for normal mount and 900g for epic mount.
---
Could be wrong
---
Seriously it's not that he's combat swords... combat swords sinister strike spam is fucking deadly during leveling.  He broke off almost 300 dmg in one hit at one point, and did 1300 dmg to the druid in like 9 seconds.  It's because he fought a druid who also burned a superior health pot.  Druid was about to get got before the potion.  
---
This thread is hilarious with it's anti combat circle jerk.
---
The key is, if I sink enough gold into it I won‚Äôt give up on the goal lol.
---
So I've been a bit confused on this because I've read that if the person being ran is a certain distance away then they won't get the drop? I've also seen people in trade chat saying things like "60s or stealth only", so does that mean the person being ran has to sneak by to a certain point? If so, where is that in Mara? I want to start offering these runs but don't want to look like a noob and have them not even get the drop haha.
---
Not as funny as dagger rogues leveling.
---
No action bars. Not unit frames...
---
The totems apply a weapon enchantment to the other players mainhand. Just like you can't have rb and wf at the same time, neither can they.
---
How are you making the gold though?
---
We need to get everyone to roll horde so blizzard deletes the Alliance
---
Guess they can... Learn something new everyday.
---
At least you got chicken.
---
I also do that on my couch or sometime I set my laptop where you see my keyboard here and push it back where it goes and watch Netflix and stuff on the big screen
---
Even if you reroll, don‚Äôt go for an orc. Undead is far better choice imo
---
Alliance will likely have instant bg queues. Also AV advantage
---
"Naga Stole My Bike" was never funny
---
I envy that setup...
---
It's always worth it to reroll if you're not having fun or don't enjoy the initial choice you made.
---
Yup, went strongly gold positive from leatherworking - focussed on fast salt shaker and selling stuff from rare recipes I picked up along the way as well as ammo bags. Cured Rugged Hide goes for ~ 30g atm on my server and the first cd use financed all salt shaker mats, tip for the engineer, the last few skillpoints I needed and gave me another 15g to save. What you craft to skill up always vendors for a bunch and upgrades your own gear/farming speed incidentally. Leather is so cheap that buying skillpoints straight from the AH costs barely anything. Skinning lets you loot so much in heavily farmed zones that it's simple to just gather almost everything you need with a comparatively low time investment. Ypur leather turns into decently valuable greens to vendor, so you're more than just self sufficient.
---
I also picked beast/dragon-heavy areas for questing.
---
While everyone and their mother are killing mobs on every layer, many zones let you skin as fast as you can run up to all the corpses. Only downside is the limited benefit of those professions in the endgame. Guess I'll drop skinning for Engineering later on.
---
I already explained this. MMOs are virtual reality not games
---
this is why you're the asshole.
---
This is an awesome post, money needs to enter the game for an economy and people dont get that. Fishing and alchemy will make great gold on private servers because the servers have been open for more than a month there, and these food buffs/alchemy buffs arent really a necessity for the current content. Im farming the felwood satyrs or mara as a  hunter, because satyrs give runes and drop roughly 5s per kill which brings in literal cash to the game. mara is great for locks,hunters, maybe spriests/druids because those blues vendor nicely. Advice to people that get rare drops like flask recipes from the dungeons; HOLD THEM!!! there price will rise for sure, especially the UBRS one.
---
&gt; I hope he learned a lesson here.
---
He's an undead rogue, so probably not.
---
You obviously have never been so invested in a videogame that it has made you angry enough to yell. Thats whats funny; for those of us that this kind of content that this content is targeted at, it's quite relatable. Maybe you just can't get excited over games anymore, which is fine and is understandable, buuuut some of us actually love these games, and live for the moments that get not only our adrenaline pumping but also our emotions overflowing. Hopefully this comment makes sense as i am HAMMERED fucking drunk as i write this.
---
YMMV. Your experiences are not exactly the same as everyone else.
---
Yeah but based off OPs explanation it doesn‚Äôt break it and without evidence given no one will ever know.
---
Yes, it's called the sunk cost fallacy.
---
[Update](https://imgur.com/a/y8M21pD) lol
---
You want those against druids but not against warriors because then you can't gouge and restealth.   Expose armor isn't worth it in pvp.  You'll do more dmg dumping evis or even slice n dice.
---
Whats silkroad
---
It‚Äôs fully legal in Canada üòä
---
I had this argument with my guild a few days ago and I was shocked that I was alone. Basically they wanted to introduce DKP and I said, no. I think it's a terrible idea because we would absolutely need to PUG and it's not fair to have people show up who would get nothing.
---
But they came back with the same thing repeatedly 'Is it fair for a person who has been raiding with us for 3 months to get nothing because someone new did instead?' as if that was somehow a good argument. Yes it absolutely is bloody fair because that person contributed to the raid kill and they should absolutely be given a chance at loot.
---
as ar ms warrior in late 40s for aoe rotation on mobs do i wanna just do sweeping strikes-&gt;zerker stance and spam ww or is just battle stance/cleave better ?
---
Don't you take at least 1 tick of damage?
---
He popped superior health potion.
---
At level 13 you shouldnt have much. The higher level you get, the faster you earn. Take a look on the AH to see if the things you are collecting go for decent amounts. If not, just vendor it. Even if it's fairly close
---
Sir... OP, 
---
this is sheer genius. And absolutely nothing lazy about it  you had to move the chair. Wite the tv to your comp. This took slight planning. 
---
 I can honestly say I'm inspired. Thanks for this.
---
Sure, reroll and send your new toon the money from the old toon.
---
dude, i play in bed with a laptop and a laptop board thing.  been doing that for 2 years now.  i have dogs next to me and wife on other side of dogs.  and we watch tv.
---
Sounds like more of a "once you get behind you can never catch up" problem to me. I get what OP is saying. Once you're oom and have to catch up to barely save the group the tank will think everything is a-ok and keep going, not realizing that you've almost wiped three times in a row. This is why we need a macro that just says, "Oy need mana mate. 15 sec before next pull plz" The difference between a fight where you go in under ideal circumstances versus starting off with your hair on fire is worlds apart. 
---
And it gets easier as you get more gear. We get spoiled with over geared tanks and healers so we want to stick with those breakneck speeds because you feel like actual heroes, but reality sets in during the run back as not every run can be ideal like that.
---
1 or 2 hits per node is normal. Rich nodes should most commonly have 3 to 5.
---
I believe that doesn‚Äôt work on classic?
---
okie. dokie.
---
Hey there, just checked, no PM :p
---
even if it ever becomes fully legal employers can still say no and test for it
---
Oh man do you remember when Skyrim first came out, how fucking magical that was getting baked and just traveling around. Just walking felt so cool, wow look at that river, oh a deer! OMG It's night time and there's a beautiful Northern Lights in the sky.. my armour makes such cool clinky noises..
---
It's the Feralas cave.
---
Lol camping is such a waste of time. Sure, avenge your death, but chill out after that lol. Nice!
---
Priest main but warlock alt. I'm disappointed at drain life being 20 yard range lol
---
Don‚Äôt forget /cast !Dire Bear Form once you hit 40, otherwise you pop a potion and stay in nelf/tauren form.
---
I've told all warlocks that end up in my group for a dungeon that I won't be healing them unless they are dangerously low. And even then, they only get a renew while I am focusing on the tank.
---
The model was updated in 1.4, April 2005. So for majority of vanilla, that was the model.
---
FYI you can get a basic VR headset for a couple hundred bucks to do this without sitting that close to a tv. You could be anywhere. Even in bed laying back!
---
It's offputting in general. Even if it's something my class cant use or I wouldn't even want .. the whole "yOu CaNt HaVe ThIs" always makes me want to leave the group. I'm new to wow and it annoys me almost as much as people who think I get on early and farm soul shards so that they dont have to run to the raid entrance. Like .. fuck off mate.
---
Yep
---
Lol kick implies your in melee range which you wont be, gouge is useless since your both just not doing anything for the duration while both of your cooldowns are resetting, cheap shot is useless with a 6 second blink, so is kidney shot.

They only chance a rogue has is improved sprint and prep, or a free action pot.
---
Free promotion!
---
Np lol
---
It's been many moons but that sounds correct.  Except for the +mining skill part, that's not true.
---
Reserved loot is stupid. If you want to reserve loot, game with friends.
---
We need you as a healer, but you get no loot or gold
---
They're games lmao
---
I try to pickpocket before every kill when applicable (it‚Äôs the only reason I ever have blinding powder) but it didn‚Äôt start making me considerable gold till lvl 40+. I also skinned a ton (I would stop and skin all the dead mobs even other players). I sold ALL my skin at on the AH at competitive levels, and that‚Äôs what I credit to having enough good to even get it myself at 43.
---
Counter strike.

Mage

Do you have 6 foot long arms? How you gonna reach your tendies?
---
A rogue would be in melee range since they stealthed up on them.

Yeah that sucks

I can kill most gray levels too
---
What kind of bots are you killing?
---
The first mages do when you open on them is to blink away.  If the mage is halfway competent, the rogue will never get back into melee.

Please finish that education and maybe get off that cell phone during English class.

From what I understood it comes with the ZG patch, as with other strong items that are better than some mc loot
---
How the f^$% is everyone getting the gold???
---
My guildy gave me one for free. As a "shaman tank" struggling through the game, it's been especially helpful for solo quests where I was struggling. 
---
But hell if I'd buy one for that price. 
---
Yet, I just passed 30 gold off to another guildy so they could get their mount quicker and told them they didnt have to pay me back.  I like the whole giving culture of classic.
---
Yikes

May i have a link to a subscription please? :)
---
It‚Äôs just less efficient, period.
---
Bartender will be able to page on modifier. I find paging useful for down ranking spells in Classic, as you can have the same spell, same spot, just different level.  
---
Also as a warlock paging is useful for curses, seeming you can only use 1 per target just put your curses on the same spot, but different modifier page.
---
Enjoy! =)
---
Oh yeah bud. You‚Äôll blow all your CDs trying to catch the fucker.
---
Not gonna happen. Sorry bub
---
Guy in my guild had it drop. So yeah.
---
I'm 25 I'm not in school you even know what makes someone a millennial??
---
i went with skinning/mining from level 5. didn't make a lot of gold. it paid for my skills while not interfering on my leveling time too badly.
---
i *should've* leveled up leatherworking right at 35 since i am warlock and had the gold to spare. but i waited until around level 50. i leveled leatherworking and tailoring both to 300 the same day for around 75g.
---
hit 60, had enough gold for my epic mount right away and i am already back up to about 500g 6 days later.
---
i haven't farmed a single mob and i never intend to other than questing.
---
semi ot -- rugged hides are down to 15g on my server :\ but i did manage to sell one @ 50g and that alone was as much gold as i made by the time i got skinning and mining both to 300, lol.
---
I bought a wireless mouse/keyboard specifically so I could do this.
---
Why can‚Äôt it be whitelisted?

Racist gnome.

;)
---
You both look like retards
---
Twitch is overrated as a way to gauge playerbase. WoW is a pretty boring game to watch unless its high lvl pvp/pve. I'm not worried about pop
---
Just a simple woosh.  We've all been there.  No need to be so harsh.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for aq40 to release and watch a random group of clowns mow through it like nothing. 
---
We are playing on the last patch before BC release. When blizzard dumbed most content down to prepare people for the expansion. 
---
The raids are going to be a joke outside of a few bosses.
---
Gross.  Wtf do you feel the need to post this?

Ur mum

I dont fight grey levels, strictly my level range
---
I had no clue this wasn't allowed.
---
Good to know I can legitimately right-click-to-report those scumbags in Gadgetzan.
---
Sounds like your server sucks...There are always gonna be shit tier servers, you just got unlucky
---
CHUD was a movie about retarded mutant cannibals that lived in the sewers; like an urban The Hills Have Eyes.  
---
He meant chud.
---
Im new actually as well, but I was told about questie and I found it much much better in terms of progressing through the game. Without questie, I'd be level 15 by now possibly. I'm at 27. Basically leveling once a day. I enjoy the exploration as well and could probably be focusing on soley leveling but I have travelled as far as I feel comfortable (some zones have too many higher level mobs). 
---
So I am playing at my own pace... But I could understand a new player going with questie for help. It really is hard to read the log at times and try to figure out what the quest is asking of you. Some collect quest or get this thing is on the other side of the map or the guy you need to speak to is in a city and there are many NPCs.... But... That is probably a reason for chat and interaction in this game.
---
I need proof. Can you get a screenshot of it on him?
---
You‚Äôre on a PvP server complaining that someone camped you after you killed them. Big yikes
---
gaww damn
---
That's a proper gaming setup sir. Not some tiny 240Hz monitor and horrible "ergonomic" chair. Just add pair of good loudspeakers.
---
It's working since launch.
---
Thank you for that.
---
I see ur lil bubbler hiding back there
---
That is hilarious
---
I was expecting it to be the manatees that write Family Guy.
---
I don't think most people will "go back to retail"... but I do think some people will consider looking for other MMOs in the "spirit" of Classic, so to speak. 
---
The problem with theme park MMOs is, well, the ride eventually ends.
---
So walk away and refuse to buy anything else from them.
---
People shouldn't underestimate recklessness. While leveling up, I've killed countless of those who thought I was an easy gank.
---
They‚Äôre called escorts sir and they work hard for their money
---
And Mages, Warriors, hunters etc etc
---
Yeah they are utter scumbags, but not against TOS unless they go against the stated rules.  
---
ALWAYS ask for loot rules before you join.
---
I don't get people who roll PvP, and then qq on Reddit no less for getting... pvped lmao.
---
Big mad on the internet.
---
Well, to be honest, I (Warrior 39) Tank with Arms Specc, up until now (SM Cath) everything was fine. Sure I do them with a Heal friend, and only pull the smallest amount of packs but it works. 
---
And before anyone tries to aggro me: I have my "oh sh!t macro" that equips 1H+Shield+Defstance and Shieldwall if my life drops down to fast.
---
It's simply the way you play, not anybody else you've seen.
---
That was so good
---
I find it hard believe people Have trouble with money? I usually have like 4-5 gold an hour (I'm level 18)  just questing. Fill bags, sell all, repeat. Don't even nerd AH.  Since I'm not rushing my leveling, by the time I level up I have WAY more then enough.
---
Time your debuff stacks just right and you can have infinite rage for executes on Golemagg. I always topped that fight for dps and damage done.  
---
You can get extra high on the meter if you bribe one of the healers to heal you exclusively and eat more debuff stacks.
---
Tbh, the ganking outside instanced is total bullshit. 
---
Hard enough to get a decent group going and finish a run, but add this shitpile to it and those runs can become an even worse nightmare. 
---
Should be neutral guards outside every instance just like towns.
---
Maybe I should say fuck tanking and just be a DPS warrior. That seems realllly fun.
---
Paladins dont suffer the same hangups that Warriors face with mages. I can run through their slows and kill them
---
First off reporting them won't do anything.  Second why?  Third see Tinyrickk's message to see how much he cares about your carebear report.
---
Nice post, I laughed
---
Something I figured out last night running strath with 2 pre raid bis locks on my 58 warrior. Mark a target with a skull (Battlemages in live side strath for example) then ignore it. Let the dps play with it. Focus on building threat on the others so when the skull does die, they can switch to anything and generally not pull before the mob is 30% hp or lower, if at all.
---
Your a fucking warlock you shouldnt need to drink noob. Drain life and soul tap forever.
---
Yeah I'm on Thunderfury which is PvP, I expect to get ganked but that's part of the game, thanks for the heads up!
---
Would be buying the normal epic mount regardless, since it's better for pvp or grinding (doesn't cost mana and hence interrupt mana regen, and doesn't expose your holy tree)
---
&gt;/use &lt;whatever water you use&gt;  
---
&gt;/p Drinking! You pull, I watch you die.
---
Don‚Äôt items in your inventory take durability damage?
---
Don't train all the skills before your mount. A lot are fine at the base rank. All the weapon attack abilities work just as well without the additional measly flat damage of later ranks. Cleave still cleaves. Overpower still is an instant weapon attack. Mocking blow is just as effective doing any damage. Skills like those are fine to leave at rank 1 without changing your leveling experience too much.
---
you just get handed your L40 mount for free. L60 one is the quest that costs a lot in mats/time
---
Consider that it might not be worth the time if you arent a super hardcore all or nothing type player. Broken tooth is cool for that 1.0 attack speed, you can get another cat that same level with a 1.2 attack speed. This is a tiny difference. The amount of times that will actually lose you a fight where the 1.0 AS pet would have swung it in your favor is probably extremely low or almost non existent.
---
I raise you good sir. A booth design: 
---
https://ibb.co/4myy4Lf
---
That is called confirmation bias
---
It certainly won't be the same challenge as it was back in the day when people didn't even know the mechanics nor strategies until they died on repeat to figure it out.
---
But it won't be facrolled by a pug either.  Big guilds will have it on farm and sell spots.  I'd be surprised if any "random group of clowns" has it beat before Naxx.  But it depends on your definition of clowns I guess.
---
this subs quality lol
---
Where did you get that board for your keyboard to rest on? I really need one and cant find any
---
This is how I end some nights after hours of grinding. HIGHly recommend.
---
You're not doing 300 dps on bosses in BRD with nothing but dots and immolate. I do a little over 400 if I have a thistle tea on those bosses and that's more damage than the other 2 dps combined 9/10 times.
---
Can't do it because I'm on a pvp server so you can't have 2 different factions on the same server
---
This is sad, and I'm not trying to insult you whatsoever. I'm referring to your situation.
---
You say this is a virtual reality and not just a game. Fine. But not even this reality you can control. The only reality you control is your own and how you react to other realities, virtual or not. If the real world is making you sad, now the virtual world is making you sad as well. Take it easy and try to relax and maybe get some help, you are only hurting yourself.
---
I hope you get better.
---
At the same time it's Friday night and I've never seen my server (Firemaw-EU) as quiet as it's been tonight.
---
lol what
---
I can agree to meta being bad for the game.
---
BUT even Molten Core is harder than LFR. I mean, come on. Have you even tried LFR? You basicly don't need to do anything. And Naxx will be hard, I promise you. Just the basic amount of consumables you need in there is "hard" for most people.
---
What a great way to kill time
---
Why would you sit around and let them camp you for an hour...what a buffoon.
---
I cant imagine life without siphon soul. Please no D:
---
What're you smoking?
---
Ranged &gt; Melee
---
Rogue &gt; Warrior
---
That is a nice looking lad.
---
Generally speaking, reserved isn't a thing in full guild runs. It's for pugs.
---
I don't mind it personally. It's perfectly fair to do a reserve run, so long as everyone's aware of it before even going to the instance. They're an easy way to get a good group and plenty of loot when you're gearing up early on (because reserved are frequently done b/c they don't need anything else from the dungeon).
---
If people are okay with X being on reserved and want to join that group, who am I to tell them they shouldn't? It's not like there's anything stopping them/me from starting my own group.
---
Because its a trinket not a weapon.
---
Wow I‚Äôm sad
---
The hat is cool but losing access to booty bay sucks.
---
Editing reminds me of punchkid
---
That is how the internet works nowadays.
---
Curious also
---
Dude me and my fianc√© have this setup x2 in bed.  Boom.
---
Haha this is awesome!
---
Jeez that must have taken forever to get
---
This setup is finger lickin finger lickin finger lickin finger lickin finger lickin finger lickin finger lickin finger lickin good.
---
How did you get the. Black border around them keys
---
eww
---
Well there must be some horrible mage players! :D
---
Right? It's absolute nonsense. Not like I'm sitting there overly excited and cheering if I get camped/ganked for a while, but I damn sure knew what's up when logging into a PvP server.
---
Also that "I hit him, but he can't do the same cuz that's the big bad bad" is just hilarious.
---
There's an addon for it. It's called rangefinder or something. I'll bet the retail version of it works on the classic client too.
---
Asmongold probably had to go have his facial twitches treated, so his fan boi base didn‚Äôt log in to follow him today.
---
I thought in the later phases mages surpass rogues. Like, when AQ comes out and they all go fire spec.
---
Warriors are always top from my understanding though.
---
I hit 300 dps today in brd. At 56. Cant imagine what i could do properly geared lol
---
A god amongst men!
---
Went by fast for me. AoE grinded SM till 44
---
Game out 1 month
---
I fully get why +damage gear is the goal. But how useful is this really for the gear in a sub-60 range?
---
For example, I don't have exact details on me now but in ZF a blue set of gloves dropped with at least +10 in int, stam and spi. I'm told they are crap compared to gloves of +9 spell damage. Really? I shadowbolt for 400 or so right now. All I'm picturing is a 409 shadowbolt.
---
I'm just worried some of these details get confused when you don't have raid gear available with +40 damage to talk about.
---
If dps held off five seconds on every pull I made I would be absolutely livid about 10 minutes into the dungeon. I work my ass off to make sure my runs go quickly and smoothly, and there's nothing more annoying than crappy dps that makes things take forever.
---
You can and you should... green wands have higher dps once you are in your upper 30s. There are good wands from quest rewards in STV, Dustwallow Marsh, and Hinterlands that all have higher dps than the Bfd wand.
---
This is an elite level shit post
---
What‚Äôs this rock elemental stuff you speak of? Sounds like something I want to get involved in. Currently a level 38 warrior.
---
To be single again...
---
*sigh*
---
/roll
---
Yeah I think really short fights that is an argument. Kind of the same logic with windfury weapon vs other enchantments.. if you are fighting very short fights (maybe you're grinding mobs that are a few levels below you, that are a bit spaced out) then it makes a lot of sense to use WF over rockbiter or the alternatives, even though over a longer fight it's been mathed out that they're all practically identical dps.
---
Sneak crack into their cola and then leave a trail outside.  
---
7/10 works usually but there are side effects.
---
Have you ever played another blizzard game (or wow) on another account?
---
Last night I joined a pug raid group of a bunch of mixed guilds. They were up to Garr however after a couple of wipes everyone started leaving. We killed some adds before then for locks to get summs. If I were to try get into another raid this week am I screwed?
---
40-50 is worse I'd say. IMO anyway
---
Sick res and go some place else, then come back in an hour or so. It's their waste of time.
---
One very happy hunter and one extremely happy hunter. It is always about hunter lwet.
---
It's funny how everyone is still about the lvl 60 rat race, I'm taking my sweet time, questing, running instances, PvP at various levels and exploring the zones, fucking with other players of the same faction, parkour, and of course running and jumping around Capitol cities.
---
See, now you're the one confusing words.  If by stupid, you mean always right, then you have indeed utilized the word correctly.
---
Come on. It still is just a game. Also get your shit together.
---
Haven‚Äôt played retail REALLY since WotlK, bought panda land to level...then lost interest... 
---
Came back for classic but, I thought, what the hell! I have subscription time let‚Äôs see what my old character‚Äôs are like....it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even recognize the game. So many tabs, and mechanics that have simply over complicated the game. 
---
Maybe because it‚Äôs so foreign to me, but regardless, I left because grinding heroics and quests and weekly‚Äôs and dailies got old fast. 
---
Too easy to level an alt, and you can only achievement hunt so long. 
---
Will never return to retail. Classic for life
---
Yeah some were easier than others, blinking too soon...too soon junior
---
Upvoted cause razer
---
Why would someone do that? Is it because Heroic Strike is steaming dog shit and its better to use WW with your extra rage?
---
And that tight there will be the cause of your back problems
---
Living the dream
---
Because you want to run it was the least number of people. If I can run MC with 20 people, that means I can outfit my 40 man team twice as fast.
---
Well, you've had time. Pick another example of Garrosh doing something good in Cata
---
I tank without a shield.
---
Please, feel free to give ret aura. Promise it'll be fine.
---
I farmed them 3 days and only thing I got was the Winter Night Pattern, which only made me ~200g so far.
---
...the year they were born?
---
yep, decent kek here also.
---
I hope so. 30-32 so far, and questing has been a chore. Never able to do more than 4-5 quests before I have to fly off somewhere else. Hopefully now I can just grind SM till the 40s. Best instance in the game!
---
This is considered lazy? I have a desk on my bed and play laying down on my laptop all day. Now that‚Äôs lazy üòÇ
---
Not directly 5 man Onyxia but similar enough.
---
Warrior here, got my mount at level 40 and have  been getting every tasty thing I can on the AH, not broke or close.
---
That guy just sucks at warrior
---
You can tell by the lack of keybinds :D
---
Pretty sure its 50-60
---
Running Garrosh did nothing wrong in skeram
---
Does +healing gear affect drain life and all the other self heals that the Warlock has in its arsenal?
---
No Warrior is trying to AoE tank with Thunderclap.
---
Anyone else almost disappointed they didn‚Äôt die to no oxygen
---
I'm level 50 currently sitting at +153 shadow damage.  It makes a vast difference in how fast you can kill things.  And the faster you kill things, the less damage you take, the less downtime you have, the faster you gain xp and level.  There's some give-and-take to be had...I'm currently using nobleman's tunic quest reward with +10stam +10int +13 damage.  An alternative would be shadowweave robe with +21 shadow, but only +7 spirit.  In that case I sacrificed a little damage for stats.  But in general, +damage is king.
---
Lorti ui
---
Yeah that's fair. I really don't think it matters too much, the dps over time of both is very very similar. If I recall correctly you need a 3.5 weapon or slower for Seal of Command to pull ahead, but if you have a 3.3 or something you're probably doing like .1% less dps lol so whatever
---
What I've been doing leveling ret is just buying the blue polearms off the AH (you can usually find them for much less than the good swords/maces/axes because not many people are interested in 2.7 speed 2Hers with str on them lol) every so often if I can't get a good dungeon weapon, and then only using righteousness, not even spending the talent point on SoC.
---
I'll give stretching them a go and see if the pain improves.
---
Can't wait to see you run through so we can slaughter you on the way in.   üòÇ
---
You were all petty retarded. Case closed.
---
Seems like you suffer from an inferiority complex.
---
You‚Äôve never heard of a mouse with side buttons before? You must be new too
---
That'd partly why this year is going to be so interesting.
---
Slowly learning rogue. Still early levels (15) I get that damage (and not dps) is best for mainhand due to instant attack like SS. And am I correct that scales only off mainhand weapon?
---
So now... what do I prioritize offhand? Dps, damage, or speed? Will this change when I get poison?
---
At 60, damage is #1. While leveling, it's a hit of a toss up. If aoe grinding, stats. Single target probably damage.
---
Generally +dmg is better than stats, but it depends on the specific numbers. I went with Dreamweave Circlet over Whitemane's Chapeau, for example.
---
Meh, it's only a waste if you don't enjoy it. A warlock had the gal to kill me, a poor solo questing warrior while I was at 20% fighting a mob so he could steal said mob. I came back and spent the next 35 minutes killing him over and over again, highly satisfying.
---
By killing shit and selling stuff lol
---
Oh christ dude.  Grow up
---
If a mage decides to aoe without being able to control the mobs they'll just die and we finish the pull as 4. After about 3-4 pulls like that they usually give up.
---
What'd you do to get gold from 35-40?
---
Quick! Somebody call the History Channel!
---
60 priest here. Found [this website](http://www.vanilla-info.com/priest) when trying to learn how to play which led to [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15heFli2p4yjWeOVR8VtLPM9jIKRlBwlYcjC4BH6gOzw/edit#gid=842610744) bis list. I like this list because it gives roughly the top 10 pieces of gear in each slot based on stat weights.
---
RFD final boss I believe
---
I would wait until the end of the quest and then kill you right before
---
Don‚Äôt be a pussy, it‚Äôs part of the game.  If you don‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt get lay
---
Yet you‚Äôve somehow managed
---
DKs should never be a thing. It's antithetical to PvP in general.
---
I stopped reading after he put warrior as 3rd and not last.
---
No, horde players just like using any given opportunity to shame any alliance players
---
Not true. Original classic you could definitely do it. Sounds like it's a glitch
---
Lol dude if OP was bitching about him camping him that would be one thing, but buying a separate license with the express purpose of angrily messaging someone on the opposite faction is the definition of petty.
---
Also, while it might no be a super cool thing to do, fishing does not give you some sort of no PvP pass. If you're on a PvP realm be more careful where you fish.

This is my first time playing WOW. 38 years old. A ton of gaming behind me. But. This game. WOW!!!
---
Yeah once AQ hits mages take 2nd place easily.

But no one beats fury, it's the 'broken' class for all of vanilla in terms of raid dps

Your raid will need 4 tanks for some occasions but will often be able to do it with 2 tanks. So two people are essentially declared offtank. But usually people rather are the offtanks than the pure prot tanks. Because prot tanks are shit outside of raids.
---
AV too is dominated by Warlocks :D There's just never enough of them.
---
Yes. And Nature's Grasp/restealth if we would be outdoors. Abolish poison instead of Faerie Fire at the start of fight to prevent Blind/Poisons. Stack rage before Frenzied Regeneration and ton of tips after ton of replays. This is a usual moment between mob kills, the video has another message actually.
---
I was grinding there all the day and he's one out of hundred another guys met in that cave. I'd like to tell him and such mates: just don't be an ass. We will all meet at 60 in AV, AB and WSG and show our fiery to each other. Let's slap some yetis for now. That was my mood for that moment :)

And no, it's not always my playstyle. I was hell ganky ass when I was young.

I quit smoking over 2 years ago mostly because i want to be able to breathe when im older. I take all the money that i would spend on cigs and use it to buy computer parts ( build a pc sales is my home page). just saying its a much better use of money then paying for cancer.

Lol my man you really have some thin skin if that light hearted jab "shamed" you.
---
I had a setup like this back in WotLK. During raids (I was main/off tank in ulduar), if I needed to do an emergency poop, I'd say "brb restarting pc" but instead switch to my laptop and continue on the shitter. No one knew.
---
&gt; the bug that stops layering on the expressway and the DMV
---
It's not a bug, it's just that layering is continent wide. You layer enough to have the expressway and DMV at reasonable population levels and the majority of the continent is going to feel too quiet and people are going to notice. 
---
Sounds like you more want sharding so individual zones can have multiple shards.
---
If threat wasn‚Äôt also the DPS‚Äôs responsibility then threat reduction abilities that they have wouldn‚Äôt exist.
---
I don't buy that.  You cast corruption presumably at his level is instacast.. why not cast immolate first then instacast corruption after.  Double the dots for only the cost of a pull.. and by time you make a next move you're on a 5 sec refresh for mana.
---
i thought about it but if i see the dude again ill do it, worchief - arugal
---
It's in quotes because I'm quoting a meme. Thanks though I guess
---
That‚Äôs why I took 5 minutes out of my day.
---
Would gain 65lbs here, no doubt. 10/10
---
Lol they're pretty useful! People seem to buy a lot. I'm actually up to 68g now! Level 39 now too!
---
I had a tank for brd try to reserve: naglering, hoj, savage gladiator chain, and a handful of other things. and he was drunk and pulling sloppy too. noooooope.
---
It really does, you might want to add it when you do other characters but right now just enjoy your first. Hope you get all the pieces of the treasure map in tanaris because that is one of the funnest exploring quests in the game IMHO
---
Your spells sometimes do a bit of bonus damage against negative resistances but going into negatives is far less effective than removing positive resistances.
---
Why the hate? He just gave you a bad answer. Druid is good because it can heal, CC, run fast and hit reasonably hard.
---
That‚Äôs part of the game dude. What this dude did after he camped my body killing me 11 times and then making an alliance toon to talk shit was petty lol
---
Imagine needing food and water
---
Best battlestation I've ever seen.... Ever.
---
I can bubble out and kill them. I can line of sight and make them come to me. They blink away I just repent them and wait till my CD are ready and 1 shot them
---
You assume too much. I just call it like I see it. I played horde in later WoTLK through early MoP and never felt the need to constantly tell people I was better by doing so. 
---
  
---
It‚Äôs a very noticeable thing, by which I mean horde players shitting on alliance. Doesn‚Äôt bother me any more that‚Äôs it just being kind of annoying.
---
What talent build were you running? Holy shit
---
Yes the good old "Wow is dead!"
---
Lmao I admit he had me going for a good bit there.
---
OP knows how to live life
---
So you knew he was a troll but wanted to comment just to humour it? :D
---
Lmfao the dagger makes it even better, to me it looks like a big chicken thug ready to shank a mf to death
---
Guys settle down he is trolling... just settle down.  He would literally have to be INSANE to seriously type out a post like this.
---
Nothing, because it didn't happen.
---
Nahh I don't really care if some people are deadweights because they play trashspeccs. But I won't complain if the raid lead decides to kick them out of the raid. I know that I won't be deadweight, because I'm well prepared and bring a lot to the table.  Hell having other people play worse than me makes me actually feel better.
---
It becomes a measure to complain once we get stuck on content because of said deadweight.
---
VB LONG NECK
---
It just kills me that he's holding a dagger lmao
---
All you have to do it put your legs together and bend over keeping your legs straight and touch your toes. If you cant reach it's fine. Hold for 30 seconds stand up slowly then go back down for 30 seconds.
---
And the mount gives you an extra 40% speed boost? I was looking and saw you could buy runecloth for other factions mounts. Would that be a good route?
---
This is why we need more Shaman tanks.  Instant threat from Earthshock and each auto attack is a sunder armor via Rockbiter.
---
I have seen some recipes up for 200g, but it is hard to tell if those are actually that valuable or if they are trying to take advantage of a new economy as I am on a less populated sever
---
Im just a tauren wishing I had more than 2 mounts to choose from :/
---
If you have to get out of bed, then that‚Äôs not lazy enough
---
Average DPS on a single target or hellfiring on a 7s encounter?
---
Most of my skills are at 300. So I think I may look to save for some cooler gear or as someone else pointed out recipes or epic mount
---
was this pic taken before our after you guys fucked?
---
I agree with you 100%.
---
Why does a female warrior need sexy armor?
---
Can confirm this bug was in original vanilla üëç
---
Its a dangerous place, stranger.
---
Why would I lie about my situation if I know that people on reddit will not get me unbanned?
---
No way, you think mount questing is slower than 30-40?? 
---
Anything 40+ is a breeze
---
As an undead rogue, this only encourages me. Your fear has no power to he who has already died.
---
When my guild did it we had the warlocks only focus on banishing and not dps. The main reason people die on that fight is poor add management, not lack of dps.
---
I agree 100 percent, I rage when getting camped. I signed up for it though lmao. You ever see those guys who roll PvP and get ganked whilst leveling, and are l ile "he ganked me for no reason, I wasn't bothering him!" Bruh it's PvP, that's all the reason. Lmao
---
If it's not rewarding, don't play it. It's the freaking height of entitlement that you think you deserve to just have a L60 because you "have a full time job" and you don't find it rewarding, so you get to cheat.
---
As if all the other people who make it to 60 are all living on welfare and never have a bad day playing the game.
---
You're a goddamned child.
---
The mage roll is perfect.
---
Can confirm. I remember off tanks swearing they were geared to survive his mortal strikes.  The pre-armor 28k or whatever proved otherwise
---
I love how people throw a fit about being ganked once. 
---
"WHAT?! I'VE BEEN MILDLY INCONVENIENCED?! I'M GOING TO BLOW THIS WAY OUT OF PROPORTION"
---
Dude who camped you has got some issues if getting killed once while fishing gets under his skin that badly.
---
You know the gy is right next to the entrance right? Lmao
---
You'll change your mind when Warriors are killing players before the intercept stun ends.  Like you won't ever get the gear to experience that yourself, but the balance is fine.
---
No one is two words.
---
Not even close, 50-60 is one of the fastest brackets
---
Everyone knows it is true
---
Based on your assumptions, you clearly didn't
---
No I haven't. I have only ever played WOW on the account that got banned.
---
Both do it. Both cry about the other side. It isn't an exclusive thing =/
---
If you've seen the way they look at each other in the recent BFA cut scenes I would say that card is 15 years ahead of its time.
---
They're dreaming of the easy money off BC.  You really expect the current WoW dev team to create content you'll enjoy?  Theres a reason BFA is the worst expac.

No he used an already mixed track, it‚Äôs low key one of my favorite  workout songs, I forget the name tho.

Yeah the gaming equivalent of a Walmart customer service worker making minimum wage definitely doesn‚Äôt make mistakes.

Huh...?

nuggies

What the point in jumping into every complaint thread just to repeat the same vitriol?
---
I wish I could enjoy it but every time i get high while playing I just want to stop playing and go watch a movie

It makes the whole picture lmfao
---
Yeah it affects me when I have to group with the entitled twat who can't play his character and thinks the world owes him.
---
Don‚Äôt think so
---
Legit lol‚Äôd at this while shitting on the toilet.
---
It is really more about raids. Nobody really cares about dungeon specs except for when you want to run a specific kind of dungeon. If I want to run a melee cleave I won't take a class that does not work for it with me. This is because I want that melee cleave to work for maximum efficiency.
---
awesome, the legion execute video is my favorite warrior video of all time
---
That actually sound pretty fun, might start leveling a shaman once I‚Äôm done with my Warrior.
---
Vanilla had a pre-patch for TBC that updated a lot of things like that was out for a while before TBC actually dropped. It might have been something in that.
---
A rollback would be fair. That way the punishment is all the money they wasted paying the power leveler.
---
And if virtual reality becomes more than a game to you that means that you have gone too far. This is dangerous man... you need to take a few steps back.
---
What kind of dumbass 17 tries it in whites?

secret huddle

awe poor hordling forgot he was alone
---
30 is the fucking worst. Just going to hillsbrad and getting ganked as fuck or owned by quest mobs.
---
Next time I will SM spam or mob farm to 35.
---
Try doing SM runs and you won‚Äôt go back to questing tbh.
---
Dude : https://github.com/LorenzCK/OnTopReplica
---
This allows you to 'copy' another window (let say chrome with Netflix) on top of everything. It allows to watch Netflix while playing the game with only one monitor.
---
And there being fewer people in raids.
---
DK were the worst things added to the game. 
---
The civilians are all over major cities, they die to aoe, they call for help, they make it so NO player ranking will ever attack a major city because they are impossible to avoid. And will count for the whole raid. The honor lost for killing them is stupid too
---
You could pot when you see a warlock tho right?
---
so much this. Often i HAVE TO use expensive (for 45-50 level) water 45 silver per 5, and make just a couple sips after pack cause nobody waiting me. And i need to drink alot cause ‚Äúdps spec warriors‚Äù cant tank even trash mobs. ;( This is frustrating, i even stopped rebuffing, csuse its 1200 mana per buff, so 6k mana for 5 players, I dont have time to drink all this mana :( sigh.
---
Lots. Zf gy is 40 to 60g an hr.
---
Me and my friends are new, and ok we are abit slow to level (still level 34) but still having  loads of fun !
---
Looks similar to my living room set up for my boyfriend.
---
Reserving loot in general is bullshit.
---
Vanilla female trolls and orcs look terrible 
---
Like baby dwarf ugly
---
That, is a bitch.
---
Imagine over 1 million players on a server. Fun...
---
Yeah you can. I did it back when I played vanilla but it took forever walljumping.
---
That's part of the game dude.
---
If i wanted to reserve something and i mention it up front and everyone agrees, can i change to master loot at the boss just to keep everyone honest? how does it typically work?
---
Warlocks have it rough with pet ninja pulls, but not as bad as hunters. We‚Äôd skip adds in the first few rooms in Scholomance and the hunter pet would run across and pull almost everything we just skipped for no reason. My succubus loves pulling random mobs in cave/mine quests that are nowhere near it. It‚Äôs just the vanilla pet class life. Easy leveling more than makes up for the occasional ninja pull. I think most people get it and you usually don‚Äôt catch shit unless it‚Äôs obviously your fault, like jumping off a ledge to skip without dismissing.
---
I can confirm the reputation gain. I'm a healer, I'm slowly starting to get whispers by tanks to heal for them.
---
Omg. This. I play on a laptop on the couch. Even then i put on the headset to talk and then feel disconnected. I get why they dont like it. The trick is to eassssseee them into it haha. Im still trying.
---
What do you mean more people? Layers add resources not people. If they remove layering, then resources are lower and players stay the same, which means that prices will rise due to demand.
---
Why are you reading my post like a retail-shitting, classic-dick-sucking circle jerk?
---
Classic doesn't have or need the transactions because it's paced so much fucking slower in order to milk subscriptions for as long as possible.
---
It's no more or less a cash cow than retail. WoW has literally been designed as a cash cow since day one.
---
I'm a simple man. I see nuggies I upvote. 
---
Named my shaman dinonugget lol
---
I've been leveling up as a pally tank. I have to drink more than my healer, so this has never been an issue =p

Jesus Christ just hit 40. I kill things 3 times faster, Jesus fuck I was bored of wanding

---
Hillsbrad yeti cave is 10 times worse than whole  stv
---
i hate there are no training dummies in this game. srsly. Thats not cool :(
---
It‚Äôs funny because even Vael in bwl will be a wake up gear check for some. A fun fight but man I have memories of people just not keeping up even in high tier gear.
---
I have that same lil bubbler you have behind the mug.
---
This looks like my hotel setup when I travel. Nuggets FTW
---
There was elitist jerks (theory crafting and bis lists) but it was more geared for hardcore progression raiders which were a very very small % back then. Not surely we common as today
---
I just said this yesterday in a group lmao
---
Keeping a second account to harass people who kill you isn't normal lol, that's advanced level petty.
---
As a warlock, I fucking LOVE when I see salv
---
Ah the migrated EVE Online player does good
---
There is def not enough quests until 50. Going to feralas and hinterlands too would help.
---
Goddam Sharms voice got better with age.
---
Stuck on the end of flight path and doesn‚Äôt dismount
---
&gt;his was the perfect opportunity to blind you while you were in caster form.
---
Basically you dot , run in travel form , hot yourself , and do roots vs melee classes. Vs clothies you go cat. boom
---
Pretty much. Whirlwind is an instant hit that doesn't reset your swing timer, which is the problem with Slam, and doesn't replace your next auto like Heroic does.
---
I'm a warrior, what's the joke? :o  I do fine on cash.
---
So affliction/dark pact and succubus is best for leveling and pve? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting from the comments
---
I'm realizing now that this is totally pointless to argue with you. That's cool that you're ok with getting a trade window in your face any time but myself and a lot of others aren't. Do you also open trade with warlocks expecting a healthstone? I get priests that ask me for food and water. Same with warlocks, shamans and hunters. Being clear about what you want helps avoid "can I get 2 more stacks" or "can I get food too".
---
I don't think we can see eye to eye here. To me it's about being respectful to one another and acknowledging that there's actually a real person on the other side of that trade window.
---
In terms of like raw amount of time? Absolutely 51-60 takes longer 30-40.
---
Yea its super funny when i stunlock you for 30 secs and eviscerate for 1500  at 50+ Some rogues are just bad
---
Thats just rude, killing people who are fishing. -.- w/e. Just cant understand this, even in real life wars there were some unwritten rules where opposite fractions wont touch enemies when they are taking corpses from battlefield or etc. Same with fishing here...its just rude. What the point? ruin other player chilling mood. wow, you are such a hero. Wowwow.

When &lt;Entitled&gt; gets wiped they just port out. :(

I had the most insane thing happen today. I wanted to do a Maraudon Quest run. We had 4 out of 5 people. Tank, Healer, 1 DD from my guild and 1 DD from tanks friends. We needed one more DD. We spend 10 minutes searching for a DD.
---
I hate what you did to my speakers.
---
I genuinely believe 30-35 feels the slowest.  This is due to the generational gap between zones.  Your basically forced to fight much higher level mobs at far slower pace, or shoved into STVietnam where 50% of your time is spent fighting for your life on pvp servers.
---
Before and after feels so much smoother.   Even 50-60 feels faster because the zones you level in are so confined and close to each other (WPL/EPL and corresponding instances) causing you fewer "travel" phases.  
---
At 30-35 everyone and their brother wants you to visit every town, every city, and every corner of the map on both contiments.  Later though, it becomes more of a when you have time, and less of a "you need this to continue".  For Ally it starts right about Amercrombie and just doesn't let off until about 36.  For horde it starts just as you begin getting directed to 1000 needles, namely quests like "Test of XXXX"
---
That's awesome I'm sick of all this togetherness shit with allies and horde helping each other do quests and playing paddy cake.  Red is dead.
---
Eu servers had like 2 hours ques before ,now it's good
---
I think you meant extremely brilliant setup.
---
I never played wow before classic either.
---
30-40 was the fastest for me... just SM grinded entire bracket
---
Game will be dead in a month. Server faction population imbalances are killing it. Horde laugh now but when they're waiting two hours for a bg it won't be funny anymore. 
---
They need to connect high alliance servers with high horde servers. 
---
Introduce a gold token.
---
Would love some clarification on:
---
Level penalty not working in PvP. Level 20s can land everything on level 60s.
---
Rich Thorium Veins having 2 hits and Small Thorium Veins having 1 hit.
---
If you are anywhere near a mob that is in combat with another player and that player dies or runs away that mob or mobs come back and attack you even though you never touched them.
---
Buying items from vendors has a terrible delay/lag when you click to buy multiple of them.
---
Sending mail to alts be it gold or items take one hour to arrive and should be instant.
---
My guess is horde camping the shit out of them for being a gnome.  Everyone is nice until they get shit on.  I kill them because I like being a giant cow and have to assert my dominance.
---
When we cant get out of a lock duh. We're still 17-2 on you guys lol. And you've never won an even fight. Ever. Shit you've never won unless it was at least 1.5:1 lmao
---
Isn't winter night pattern bop ?
---
If the level range is 55-"xyz" then you're in level range.  The group advertising needs to mention specific age requirements outside of the level range
---
Dude yes!  Skyrim and Classic are literally the only games I can play high comfortably.. The immersion, the relaxation, the genuine lack of care for efficient quest-work... üëå
---
PLease take a screenshot tomorrow and send it to me.
---
I honestly can't tell who is trolling who here.
---
SO! Any spells you cast break the mind control, BUT make sure your pet action bar is on, that is how you cast enemy NPC moves, and I believe some of other players buffs and cool downs (I believe you can blow their cool downs and waste them, haven't used it much in PvP). Example, in SM Cath, if you have pet action bar turned on, you can mind control the Wizards, and use their arcane explosion for AoE, which is SUPER strong. Hope this helps a little, I know you're talking about you casting on them while you have them MC'd, and that breaks the mind control, but just sharing what else I know about it (pet action bar got me for a while).
---
Like the kingdom hearts font
---
came here for the classic babies determined to justify 15 year old raid mechanics being equal in difficulty to current raid mechanics. if the fact that mc and ony are being 20 man pugged hasnt woken you up to the reality of vanilla raiding, nothing will. every raid will be pugged, every tier will probably be progression one shot. even naxx. that doesn't mean it wont be fun to experience, or play through but for real, azshara has 56 mechanics. that single 9 minute fight is more complicated than the entire first 5 or 6 tiers of raiding combined.
---
Yeah on Skeram there's a Kargath taxi in constant effect.
---
I really want to know who the OP is so I can blacklist them now before having to come in contact with them.
---
i found a TON of chests in burning steppes but they aren't dropping much, a few gems, but rarely any greens.  Do these chests drop blues or purples at all or are they just very rare?  I think in BC they used to contain a lot of blues back in the day
---
Yep, you do 80% of the work just so the warrior can do 40% of his dps in a fight in the last 20%.  
---
Also, this is garr, and and am pretty sure he is immune to nature damage, so rogues are going without the normal poison procs.
---
thx will check
---
this belongs to /r/cozyplace
---
Leveled a mage first for this reason. 
---
My Warrior is now level 18 decked out aswell as 150 engineering. 
---
Epic mount as soon as he dings 60
---
I will say I'm leveling as enhanc shammy but as soon as I hit 60 I will be resto, so starting at ST I've told group before hand I will be rolling need on my BIS resto gear. Because leveling as resto is just not efficent
---
&gt;My Druid tanking buddy rocks one of these and some offhand with resists on it, I‚Äôd say 20g is more than fair.
---
It's legit. Warden Staff just dropped for me, so that's the obvious choice, but Argent is considered the BIS 1 hander.
---
What has been seen, cannot be unseen.
---
Been leveling a pally and having a blast.  Everyone keeps telling me, "in a few levels you'll see why they suck" and I've been hearing that since my first DM run, and I'm in Duskwood now and still disagree with them. I'm having a blast.
---
No?
---
That‚Äôs so good
---
As annoying as it is, I can definitely imagine it adding a sense of realism, at least for RP realms lol
---
They did that because... they had to.
---
To be fair, HP potions can save his life, and I'll likely be using those same 1g Mana potions to save his life as well when he pulls while I'm at 10% Mana. So his loss is probably greater keeping them lol.
---
A lot of time is spent 51-60 farming pre-raid BiS gear.
---
31-40 is literally just time spent walking between A-B-C doing quests with shit density until you can spam Scarlet Monastery. And if you're alliance, SM runs are fucking slow running from Southshore.
---
51-60 might take longer, but there're secondary goals, a lot of dungeons, and Un'goro crater to diversify the process. 31-40 is basically a choice between SM spam, or playing in the insanely contested STV.
---
As a tank if i see any caster sit, especially the healer, i will sit too. Usually stops the dps from doing stupid things... Usually
---
Doin the same grind as Alliance. Human mage getting the tiger. 6650/21000 atm -- On the plus side, I'll have way more surplus gold by the time this is finished. :)
---
Upvotes to all these, Corsair, Logitech, and Razer all make one, and I switched to it around MoP, makes playing so much easier, and you can EASILY play with one hand, takes a week or two to get completely used to, but once you have it down, it's the best!
---
Yes
---
So how do you ensure that the rules are established up front?
---
None of that matters, the dude was a douche and so is anyone else who does shit like that
---
that cat, makes me sad
---
&lt;sirens.mp3&gt;
---
30-40 is definitely a bit of hell. Mentally anyway. It‚Äôs the last push to a mount. And it feels like a lot of the zones aren‚Äôt really fresh. Early 30s feels rough because you‚Äôre still mainly questing in zones you‚Äôve exhausted for a solid 5+ levels already and STV doesn‚Äôt start feeling feasible till 35ish. And even STV is a fucking zoo with PVP and ganking. SM runs are great but they get real stale after awhile. And it‚Äôs the weird middle ground where you don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúclose‚Äù to 60 yet.
---
I've probably gotten a free thousand rage from that chest. I went on AH today and still dont see anything worth replacing yet. Probably @ 40 like you say.
---
I feel like I could have fun with this.
---
See how long I can go without anyone noticing I'm doing literally zero DPS all raid.
---

This is amazing I love the classic wow community

my NE Warr has the same road ahead to get a ram

&gt; That or you go assassination and just.... never let the other side play at all.
---
Free action potion says hi.
---
Just go combat. Yeah. Thats the best course of action. Mmmhm.
---
It's completely fucking ridiculous that they will ban you for doing something they intentionally didn't add an easy fix for.      
---
    
---
They left something exploitable (through relative normal in game actions, not through file manipulation or some crazy bug shit) **on purpose,** and then ban people for doing it.    
---
     
---
That's fucking absurd.
---
So yeah it's 7.30am here in the Netherlands. Just woke up second thing up my mind is to remind my good friend badvok666. Have a nice day.
---
It is. Reserved means it's mine, even if you need it. Just like a ninja. And you are right, I never join these groups.
---
Yeah. He was meme enough to use fire on immune things, but also stupid enough to get caught? For shame.
---
this is fairly common. when i hit 44, i went to tanaris and picked up every quest i could.
---
the resulting quests netted me roughly 1 level. from the entire zone (and there arnt enough 40-50 zones to get 1 lvl each and make it to 50)
---
now ill admit there was maybe 1 or 2 quests i couldnt do as they were like lvl 50 or so. but those gave me less 1 bar each when i did do em.
---
as it is alot of the zones have very very few quests. which is in stark contrast to a place like STV or the barrens.
---
this is ofc by design, blizzard back then wanted you too grind mobs and ofc do dungeons. this can make getting into classic a bit hard as its such a massive time sink to make it to 60 to do the cool shit.
---
some would say: "well its the journey not the destination" 
---
for those of us who have already done the content: there is no journey. aka it makes it a bitch to reroll or have alts.
---
despite that, im still leveling. im in a love hate relationship with classic right now
---
It's okay. Apparently all you need is a tiny dagger to stop that.
---
stop troling
---
Is there an add-on that would let me copy/paste in game, doesn't seem to work for me when searching for quest/items
---
The only wrong thing you did was to leave after the pull instead of losing agro and just hearting out of there.
---
I thought this was going to be the same route as a hundred other videos so I'm glad I watched it.  This is so much faster; like 1 minute instead of 1 hour.
---
Good, good. Let the retribution flow through you...
---
Depends how you do it and what faction you play, etc but for me 30-40 was noticeably longer than 50-60, the final stretch I could go anywhere and no one would camp me. 
---
30-40 I had some 8 and 10 hour levels from having to change zones 4 times a level after being camped by a 5 man group for an hour, etc. 
---
50-,60 all my levels were 5 hours or under.
---
Is there an addon that lets me add notes to other players characters? Something like:  
---
* Right Click  
---
* Add Note   
---
* Type   
---
Then when you hover over them it'll appear in the tooltip for them or something?
---
Not wrong. For both a dungeon and raid that contains pugs, if you want to reserve something it should specifically be stated while forming the group. At the very latest, before you start the pull of the dungeon or raid.
---
I‚Äôd be pissed if I got to LBRS just to be told Hands of Power is reserved for the warlock in group. Like please tell me what‚Äôs reserved in your pug message, or at the very least before I get to the instance, otherwise my time was wasted.
---
If those gloves dropped and they just get looted to the warlock, and then I‚Äôm told they were on reserve, I‚Äôd be pretty mad if I wasn‚Äôt told in advance. 
---
I‚Äôd consider it ninja looting for sure.
---
So much this.
---
I took about 2-3h per level in the 30-40 range while I took 5h+ each level on 51-60. It felt so much longer...
---
More than likely not unless blizzard gets greedy.
---
Yeah there's a lot of things that could have been done but the biggest thing I always scream at people is if you are against ANY melee, demo roar. It lowers their damage.
---
And I laughed when the rogue vanished into faerie fire.
---
Did they seriously go grab a new license just to talk shit? After camping someone for ten kills? Cornballs.
---
I'm not trolling. We need to do something about the economy
---
&gt; not like it affects the game play
---
It kind of does, if you build a bad rep on your server for ninja looting or whatever, and then just pay $20 to get a fresh start. Personally would not like to see this added.
---
This was me back in high school for Diablo 2. Even with a slab of wood for the mouse and keyboard.
---
If I were the worlds best hacker, I would wait for people to say #NoChanges, and then see what add ons they are using.
---
You‚Äôll be fine as long as the dps let you get aggro
---
Shut your filthy mouth!
---
Uh.. you're playing a rogue? And you let people heal before you kill them? 
---
Sure I don't go around killing 20% hp lower levels mid fight. But I'm not about to help the enemy if I want to kill them.
---
I was fighting yetis in ferelas near the chicken escort quest. When a group of 3 horde come up to do the quest. The mage in their group was agro af, he chased me, made me vanish, then proceeded to run around on his mount looking for me in stealth, I'm no amature so theres no way he'd find me. But having done the quest they were attempting I knew just what to do. I wrapped around them still stealthed, jumped down near the coast and water and kept running north to the ramp where their quest would end, and they fight the final mob of like 5 enemies including a healer. I waited for them there for about 5 minutes give or take and when I saw them approach, I waited for them to engage the final pack. Then I joined in, stunlocked and killed their warlock since his fear would ruin my plan entirely, then ran to the mage, fought him and killed him. There was a shaman left who managed to finish the rest of the quest mobs and was escorting the chicken the rest of the way, I bandaged really fast since the mage got me to half, and went to go fight and ended up killing the shaman.
---
I was just going to kill yetis, be careful when starting shit with rogues, we can be persistent.
---
Feeling that at 35. Back in Hillsbrad now to wrap up the Alterac Mtn quests, then off to Arathi Basin!
---
I envy you so much.  I started in 2006 and still remember my first playthrough and all the mistakes i made.  They're a learning experience you wouldn't get if someone tells you about it. Keep doing what you're doing,  man.
---
Motion sick.. or sea sick?
---
there were Gold Farmers back then, there need to be Gold Farmers now. no changes
---
51 to 60 is insanely slow, lvl is solid 8 hours of grinding/questing.
---
It's 50 rep a stack or 55 for humans. Revered to exalted is 420 stacks or 378? For humans.
---
I'm a druid who's just saying that other druids should pass on this to warriors and rogues.  It's far better for them, and unless you're putting in the effort to powershift and pummeler farm to cat dps don't take it over someone who's gonna use it for 5 phases.
---
Now scroll down and show the other half that says "Medium/low" :P
---
For those unaware, his name is Gunther Arcanus. As you're questing through Tirisfal Glades you'll find out that he freed himself from the Lich King on his own, and various Forsaken refer to him as a Lich, likely due to his powers as a spellweaver alone.
---
[Here's a short video on Gunther](https://youtu.be/LCxgOCu-Tg8)
---
Onyxia has never been really hard. You're not even supposed to dps for half the fight.
---
Imo they would branch off classic with new content. I speculate that atvi investors expect growth. TBC expo would be safe, but they won be able to grow.
---
ofc my speculation is as useful as any. I doubt even blizzard know what they want to do from this point
---
chests you already looted you mean?  Any classic addon that just shows all the chests , even the ones you never looted before?
---
That' Dark.
---
Or don't hide it at all?
---
Yeah...can't compare this trash to alliance mount looks
---
Yeah but they have to get karma and validation by bitching about every little thing on reddit.
---
"Even if I had gotten the staff, all it wouldve given me is more stamina"
---
It is known
---
&gt; That's the power of ~~love~~ WoW.
---
Need more gold, need more rep, need another credit card to play this game...
---
First time you play it, it might make you sad...
---
Second time you play it, it might make you mad...
---
But you'll be glad baby when you've found...
---
It's the power of gold that makes Azeroth go around....
---
maybe you're on a dead layer?
---
Also, are you eating them with your fucking feet? You animal.
---
Some of the key things:
---
Any BoE items you may need (usually at least a few hundred gold depending on class)
---
Enchants
---
Consumables for raids (this is big, and continuous) 
---
Reputation to farm (some rely on hand ins rather than kills)
---
And then with new phases coming, there will be new BoE items, new loot to enchant, new consumables, etc. 
---
Particularly AQ40 and Naxx are expensive in terms of consumables and resist gear.
---
Charge, sweeping strikes, zerker, bloodrage, berserker rage, WW, cleave, mortal strike if everything is on CD and you have extra rage, repeat. Chart topping rotation always
---
No.
---
nice try kfc
---
All u need is a neck pillow my friend
---
I have a lot of trouble getting gold. I can agree farming can be hard sometimes, but gold tokens is not a good idea. That would take the grinding away in classic and give everybody an easy solution for money. Even if you make the gold ridiculously expensive, I still think a lot of ppl will buy the tokens and it would ruin the in game economy. Prices will skyrocket and the ppl who don't farm hardcore or who don't buy gold won't be able to buy anything anymore at AH's
---
And how exactly was he supposed to vanish with faerie fire on him?
---
I see..
---
So the sword specs are significant enough to make a worse sword still the better choice? Interestinggg
---
I'm a horde druid and having lots of fun with this class. For an alt I'm thinking going maybe warrior or warlock. I really want to have an alliance char aswell. To get that alliance vibe and do different quests. I don't really feel like doing the same quests again, but am worried I'm missing out on some same server "alt perks". Should I roll alliance or should I make an horde alt on the same server? What are the pros and cons?
---
Blind and then what? Sprint away? He can't restealth with faerie fire on him.
---
Once you get the hang of it, not very geared at all for Gizlock and Princess. Rotgrip is a whole different beast, I havn't figured out how to kill him without doing an extremely tedious pull from the bridge.
---
Haha, oh. I thought someone had actually found a way to obtain flying.
---
It's one of the reasons I uninstalled few days ago. I'm only lvl 25 but the long grind to 60 doesn't even seem worth it when the end game isn't great. No arena, no BG yet, raids are extremely faceroll, etc... Retail end game is amazing, no doubt about that.
---
Hi, this is a standard functionality for WoW, check interface settings.
---
Not sure where it is exactly, but you are looking for additional action bars.
---
The problem with them though is fixed position and size.
---
I‚Äôm personally using ElvUI for that as I really like look and features.
---
Jealous you get nearly double the quests to get rep from and start out as friendly.
---
Nice set up! :)
---
You can just add that in the normal menu I believe
---
It is available. Look below where it says 'available in Phase 1'.
---
Vanilla ended with 1.12 and went to 2.0 with the BC pre-patch. 
---
1.13 is literally just the naming convention for 1.12 running on the modern client.
---
I think it's in the interface options. U can add 4 extra bars. It's really nice yeah.
---
I'm a priest
---
If you shift left click an object it will post that in the chat box
---
Those are defaults. You can display two bars above the normal bar (covers all the way from normal bars to the end of your bags) and two bars on the right side of the screen. You have to check a box somewhere in your interface options.
---
Recommend just taking ur time to go through the options. There's some really nice ones like bind a button for auto walk or instant quest text
---
Also curious as I‚Äôm leveling my alt on the opposite faction as my main
---
Also I actually enjoy pvp, not killing people that have no chance.
---
7 agility is better
---
How do you keep aggro?
---
I guess you dont care about professions, fishing, first aid, or cooking. 
---
Maybe play a different class if you're bored. You want to click a bunch of different buttons? Play a rogue.
---
Either way, they're not going to add this stupid shit to a game that's 15 years old.
---
Literally just run dungeons and sell everything
---
The way they phrased it sounds like they‚Äôve made that much gold making and selling the robes.
---
Wild guess: when you raid and cant dot because debuff limit?
---
It sounds like you want to DPS and off tank, which Warrior can totally do, and DPS Warrior is good in raid. I found Hunter very frustrating for the first 15 levels and quit (the dead zone, pet maintenance, finding groups, etc). Haven't leveled a warrior yet so take my recommendation with a grain of salt, I guess.
---
A guy literally got unbanned the other day because his post made r/wow front page.
---
Battle stance is always worse for dps. The only reason to be in it is for Battle-specific abilities.
---
Sweeping Strikes will stay active when you switch out of Battle Stance, so what you want to do is Charge-&gt;SS-&gt;Zerker-&gt;WW, making sure you pool enough rage to be able to WW on cooldown and spend your excess on Cleave.
---
*shakes fist in Common*
---
Rockbiter / Earthshock? Stoneclaw sometimes?
---
The obsession with full bis is a strange one. I guess people overestimate how hard MC bosses are
---
Have your tried NUGs energy? It fills up to show ticks.
---
Also interesting how they never have any proof
---
I don't think so. It requires the *weapon to hit* I believe.
---
SM has a main and offhand for you. Uldaman has a chestpiece that's fine until Sunken Temple, Maraudon has bracers, boots. I'd recommend you install Atlasloot and take a look at the drops from bosses on that.
---
If you actually think this, you're insane seek help.
---
There you said it. Part of his free time.
---
The potato quality is the perfect touch
---
I sense a lot of Mara runs were had
---
Thats what i figured. Hoj works but not a weapon hit.
---
Keep running Cath til bout 44 then do some ZF to like 50-52 , then you can start prebis farming to 60
---
TitanPanel
---
I had no idea, I play ally on skeram, and can never get dungeon groups let alone trains to places haha
---
just figuring out what to do for doing BRD, and know I will need to switch for raiding anyways. trying to decided if I should switch at 51 or keep going affliction
---
**Never played wow -** Check
---
**Mage -** Check
---
**Has mount -**  Check
---
Not surprised. No but really, congrats! :)
---
Looks like a removable center segment of a table.
---
100%
---
Ir that's true, I was wrong.
---
I don't know the exact numbers, but something like if the mob you're fighting will take longer than 30 seconds to kill, that's when you judge crusader.
---
The idea is... The burst judgement damage from SoR and crusader is almost always better than the bonus damage from judgement of crusader. I'll only judge crusader if there are multiple Paladins in a dungeon because it'll amplify everyone else's damage.
---
It's a God damn masterpiece
---
Brown trout
---
Make sure to establish clear loot rules before starting the run. If nobody says anything and the leader changes to ml whenever and takes everything, blizzard won't do anything.
---
I lost it at the Barrett 50 cal serpent sting shot. To good. Don‚Äôt stop!
---
You'll prolly get blacklisted from the service if you pull that, so you'll only be able to scam them out of 50s per char if you try that
---
Just to update i have not been able to find anything via google.
---
My friend had read some books back during classic time and gave me my dwarf hunters name Iofur, but I mistook the ‚Äòi‚Äô for an L and thus Lofur was born.
---
Reliving him again now and it‚Äôs fun fun fuuuuun!
---
Any hardware store?
---
So is it worth it to put points into Improved SotC? Thanks for the info :)
---
Chicken nuggets in kfc gravy???? You‚Äôre my spirit animal
---
There is no reality hop tho
---
For an RP name, hit "random" until I see something I like or alter one of the suggestions. For a non-RP name, I pick something related to the class's role or abilities.
---
Or steal a name from the [Onyxia Wipe video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUXdcrSbIho)
---
What was boring? I genuinely see most stuff as an hard adventure and that's fun for me
---
Yeah it is absurd... Who said to shard it?
---
Then play retail
---
As a rogue I can easily kill most locks in one opening combo (succu makes this more difficult) but a tanky warlock with lots of health and a succubus pet, that's a scary thing.
---
That's a good point. Clear communication from the outset.  That'll get the run off to a good start to make sure everyone is on a same page and working together
---
I have the world‚Äôs most uncomfortable metal stool.  My core has to support my body during extensive PC time or I‚Äôd be made of jello and throw my back out monthly.
---
School specific bonus damage does not ignore the rule, for a spell of that school it works exactly the same as spell damage. The main reason school specific damage is interesting is because an item of the same level will have significantly more of that than generic spell damage, and when you're just spamming shadow bolts it doesn't matter that your immolate doesn't deal increased damage.
---
And yes, the spell power bonus is calculated before talents etc., so your shadow bolt will deal the same amount of damage with Bane than without. Instant cast spells are considered 1.5 second casts and any spell with a cast time longer than 3.5 seconds is calculated as a 3.5 second cast time.
---
Totally man. There isn't really an objectively best spec for most people, because most people aren't good enough at the game that they can really take full advantage of the gains you get from any given spec. It's much more about preference. (Although I would still prefer to recommend VW to beginners.)
---
Also a popular vacation spot.   Lounge on the beach of beautiful Brightwater Lake.  Or visit the quaint shops of Brill right outside of Undercity.  See historic Scarlet Monastery and run gibbering through the night at Agamand Mills.   Yes its great fun for the whole family!
---
At least a hundred to be honest.
---
Unless your laptop is from early 00s or you're running Windows XP, keep is plugged in.
---
It increases damage, but it doesn't apply the debuff.
---
A shaman gave me 3g when I walked up to him and said 'Ey you fly as fuck' then walked off. That really made my night lmao
---
Fairbanks?
---
I had the gold for my epic mount when i decided to rep grind for Darnassus, took about 6 days to get the 700g for runecloth doing Maraudon runs solo as a warlock. The initial 900g i had was gained in about 1 and a half weeks through flipping AH, dungeon running and professions.
---
I remove my battery so the heat doesn't affect it
---
DM me if you make it!
---
Lol I'd call it more of an innocent joke than a troll. And it was clearly intended xD
---
r/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Exactly. The service itself is more important than someones greed over a small fee. They're the only ones on the server who are going to make countless level 20 locks and park them all over the world.
---
I mean, we have all of the best raiders and the best PvPers as well so.. Fair trade off.
---
As a warrior my self that has tanked DM and run as dps with a bear tank, I think that the bear had a easier time then I did. Mainly due to a larger health pool. I also struggled alot with rage generation so if you can manage that as bear then you will go good. 
---
Side note: neither myself or the other dps pulled threat from the bear given a second or two to get decent threat
---
Most of your damage will come from claw and white attacks, so rake isn't that special that you should avoid cat form. Also I would say what you use is situational. One on one mobs for fast kills, use cat. Multiple at the same time, use bear.
---
Lol ret
---
Yeah it isn't expensive at all. 1-225 cost me like 15g
---
Instance farming is an amazing way to make gold, soloing Deadmines and vendoring EVERYTHING is a solid 15-25 gold an hour depending on drops, there's an NPC right outside you can use to sell as well.
---
I‚Äôm taking notes....
---
Yes, everything you said is true and agrees with what I've already said. I did say that it's an overall faster build to use, but that the fact that it's harder to utilise properly means that people should be less trigger-happy about recommending it to new players.
---
Succubus for PVP is definitely true against melees (except feral druids). Against hunters and other casters Voidwalker can do just as well, if not better in some cases.
---
This is like one of those craigslist ads looking for a female roommate.
---
Typical horde
---
Hateful strike, not mortal strike
---
Why cant I fullscreen the right way?
---
There‚Äôs TotalRP which allows you to add notes to other player characters, it is an RP add on so you‚Äôll also have the whole backstory and character description added too.
---
Yeah you can import the data :) (included)
---
Your what
---
Oh my bad then, guess Gnome Warlock is still ok with Escape Artist and increased Intellect...
---
Why Azshara? What's there?
---
Not to mention downrankings which OP doesnt have to do because he is a warrior
---
Some people just want the original expansions again instead of building a real future for classic.
---
I'd consider it bad taste to take something you can't use yet from someone who can use it, especially if it's a dungeon like Cathedral that you're going to be running a lot more anyway.
---
Spare change?
---
You are right and its not specifically a WL problem. With high risk meta I mean the combination of warriors charging in with 2h, the constant movement after mob kills, no time to regenerate to full mana, combined with mages/wl tanking hits to aoe 3-5 mob packs, and wl juggling with their health and mana to maximize their dps. Its how the game evolved but I doubt that the higher speed outweighs the constant treat of wiping for the average joes.
---
You should be able to. They're just quests like any other
---
Also a goon on Incendius
---
If you havent done this bind strafe to A and D and unbind Q and E and use them as keybinds. They are some of the best keybinds. Also bind mousewhee√∂ up and down.
---
I believe he's talking about spell skills not profession skill level. But yeah, epic mounts the biggest thing. Consumables for PVE and PVP. I'm at 48 and I've been lending a 5-10g out as guildies hit 40 if they're a bit short.

---
I think this order is aronud the best for mixing tanking and solo content
---
Damn son
---
&gt; I know that blizz likes their money, hence why multiboxing is allowed,  but at least multiboxers level all of their accounts themselves. 
---
Q1) "Multiboxing is only allowed because Blizz gets money for those accounts"
---
A1) Patently false. Even now, with it being easier to do so, Multiboxers are a small fraction of the playerbase. They ban more people for "being toxic" in chat every month than they have multiboxers period. They recently banned a multiboxer friend of mine (before the layering exploit - was for some other abuse before that), so they can and do ban them, if they do something illegal.
---
Also, everyone who says this doesn't realize: 5x chars farming gold in Retail = buying 5 Tokens and NOT PAYING BLIZZARD A DIME. This excuse has been going on since 2004 and as long as the Token exists, it is 110% false, if anything, Blizzard is \*paying to let them play\* now.
---
thats what every video game subreddit eventually turns into. people complaining about people complaining about people complaining. The best action is just to ignore everything.
---
You can't just reserve all the good loot lol. A rare weapon, a mount, a rare trinket...that's about it. You can't reserve every BIS for your tanks when someone else is the one tanking in the first place.
---
Yeah this boi broke. 75g is a good investment for hurricane.
---
Well I never said it needed to be female I'm just looking for someone to combo with. But your clever I'll give you that. I'd pay to see you do stand up honestly. I think you are very funny. I hope to hear more those. I bet all your friends think your hilarious.
---
In Legion my account got wrongfully banned for another reason. They were very vague, when they finally transfered me to a manager I was able to get the info of what I actually did and therefore could explain it resulting in being unbanned. This isn't just a case of a bad GM, they are taught to be super vague. I would try escalating to a supervisor to plead your case.
---
If you go this route, then go to Interface Options -&gt; ActionBars. Bars 2 through 5 correspond to the action bars as they're ordered in this submenu.
---
I mean it‚Äôs fine for just grinding out mobs at 60 but the build is insane for leveling especially post 30. The whole point of the build is to have 0 downtime and to never really be at risk of dying. I‚Äôm 60 now and been deep af the whole way, how are you dying? Pulling one mob at a time you should only have to eat every 10+ mobs or so if they‚Äôre at your level and if they‚Äôre green you should be able to handle 2-3 at a time especially if you‚Äôre using cc.
---
I like priest in groups. Hate it soloing. Overall favorite class is probably warrior.
---
We cant see the hole in the sofa for the poop bucket, but we know its there
---
if you got a problem with it, then make your own group. No one is forcing you to group with them.
---
See if you can find your realm's Discord server, too. You should be able to find a social guild through it which can help.
---
Can I interest you in buying some jeggings and essential oils?
---
Mage cuz mages fuck
---
This is a thread about AoE...
---
I think your second point is really good to keep in mind. Confidence is key. I only had one run where I lost it in ZF where a warrior and a rogue kept taking threat with every mob no matter what I did. I felt utterly useless. We didnt wipe but that was only because they out leveled it.
---
As to your first point, I started out firmly in the "teach them a lesson camp"  but I've softened a bit recently. I give people a chance or two to change or learn. But if they have a bad attitude stuff them
---
I'm not a funny person, never have been.
---
Nogginfogger Elixir! I love those, do a quest and you can buy them off an npc.
---
Ah, yes, true
---
Well, TIL. Thanks
---
Why do you have a golden pumpkin ?
---
Can us ooze owners get together and petition them to fix it. It's kinda gamebreaking
---
Gay
---
Unless we both use details, then i can see your talents lol. But fuck me who cares
---
They're not referring to that. Currently oozeling doesn't give you a green aura as it should, that's the only bug. You can't get multiple debuffs with the ooze
---
55 is like a soft level cap cause you can start farming your endgame gear
---
1000+
---
I don't know  ever since that build came out everyone vows by it but I don't find it as efficient as the vw one. I'm juggling health and mana constantly and my dl does little damage until I can get the talents that improve it. Also quite dangerous in a pvp server since you can get ganked so easily and beyond a quick seduction from the succubus there's little you can do
---
A+
---
Ninja looting was huge before LFR/LFG. Retail has nothing to do with it. There were notorious ninjas on my server who led PUGs constantly.
---
Spanish... the language is just really exciting and I love the culture!
---
Just remember that most gear you lvl with won‚Äôt be pre bis. It‚Äôs okay if that is the case too.  Mostly BRD LBRS UBRS STRATH will give you most lucrative gear before raiding.  Look up pre bis and hunt it down, it‚Äôs worth :) good luck to you :)
---
Well the wow token is contrary to pretty much everything classic stands for. So yeah, im gonna have to agree with the no crowd.
---
Furthermore 10k minimum? For a 20$ token? Good luck with that.
---
Trash from both, mostly, but maybe you can also sell Tiger Meat from tigers and definitely Elemental Earth from Elementals.
---
This is so confy
---
I would argue not the healers but I haven't played one in classic. Are there things a healer can do to manage/mitigate threat?
---
I'm saying a praising of the moral action done by someone without knowledge of the bible negates the necessity of the bible for morality. You may not be making this argument but I've heard it many times from Christians that without the bible we'd all just be raping and pillaging.
---
Perfect morality can't be achieved? Prove it.
---
Man's fallen nature? Prove it.
---
And I do, I think we're just using different definitions. I would call what you're talking about  absolute morality, not objective morality. Objective doesn't mean the same outcome every time, it means the using the same logic every time. For example in chess an objectively good plan is to not lose your queen. However sometimes it is necessary to lose your queen to win. Sometimes losing your queen is an objectively GOOD move. Both these scenarios use the same objective logic of 'winning the game', without having absolute rules like "never lose your queen". This is what I mean by objective morality, thou shalt not kill is like don't lose your queen, 99% of the time it's objectively the most moral, But not every time. This is still objective.
---
And you're saying you'd rather be owned as property than be homeless? You're acting like being a slave was just a low SES vocation. These people were prisoners that were bought, sold, killed, tortured and raped at the whim of their owners with no repercussions. They had no rights, they were property. This is grotesquely immoral no matter what period of time you happen to be in. Slavery wasn't condemned internationally because we have better living conditions in modern times. The bible doesn't say: "free any slave your find and give them food and shelter in exchange for work", it completely condones the practice. What you're saying is ridiculous.
---
I was thinking a $500 token
---
The ideal would be to pull 2 or 3 and have the dps focus on just one target at a time. you can normally hold the group as long as they don't aoe or start attacking randomly. 
---
A lot of people in the comments here apparently have never played a warrior lol. Taunt is on a 10 second cooldown. And warriors need to do damage and take damage to build rage to use abilities.
---
In the meantime, farm ZF like it is nobody‚Äôs business :)
---
Did u get the memo this was an mmo
---
Sure does! How is this a witch hunt?
---
But weren‚Äôt 90% of players supposed to leave after a couple of weeks?
---
Druids are fun and versatile!
---
Sword rogues thinking they‚Äôre viable for PvP LUL

so why is there a talent right under the talent that increases melee damage by 10%, that gives you a free spell if you melee in caster form? omen of clarity ONLY works if you melee in druid form. MELEE IN DRUID FORM!!!! whats so hard to understand theres tons of signs that im correct and youre all confused.
---
This is where the gold spec come in play!
---
Tried everything, Disc Priest is my calling. I can pinpoint exactly what I love about it, it just has the mechanics that keep me most engaged in the game.
---
What‚Äôs the best mobs to farm for trash around 35-40?
---
Then you're playing the wrong class LOL
---
*picks assassin character* 
---
*thinks surprise attacks are bad*
---
I like challenging fights that's why I pick my fights carefully, 1v3 during their quest was a fantastic time to attack and it was fun, they also started it
---
This is great almost exactly the same as my set up and it's so comfortable
---
I've got classic threat meter installed, it only really works if other people have it as well, I almost never see anyone else's name pop up on it
---
I ended up just taking all the sides of the case off.  I know people worry about dust buildup but this case literally has existed since the '90s just replacing different internal parts and I've never had a heating issue.
---
It makes sense that it dropped on your last run as you usually stop running once you got it.
---
I‚Äôd like you to edit my videos it mostly consists of me drinking everyone I die and throwing rotisserie chickens at walls. Also I get naked sometimes
---
Because they bring more utility to the raid and serve as a damage increase for other classes, such as warlock.
---
Yep. This is how WoW Classic always was. Lots and Lots and Lots of Loot Drama.  
---
It's all anyone is really aiming for in those dungeons before they burn out.
---
He isn't preventing people from using the flight path tho, just making it harder. Lots of types of "griefing" is just part of this wonderful game
---
Of course I have been. I just don't find it funny to see the same cuts and zooms and also the same Soundfiles and samples on the 700,000th video.
---
Retail is probably the only reason I'm here tbh.
---
I'm an oldschool player who came back for BFA. Got to 120, played about 3 weeks and then quit. BFA is what lead me back to my guild of 10+ years and helped me reconnect on Discord.
---
I absolutely hate Retail and could write an essay about everything wrong with it, but I'm not going to do that. If it weren't for retail I probably wouldn't be playing classic.
---
So fucking annoying too when the tank complains about not sticking to his target while not marking it with an icon and tab targetting everything resulting in everything half HP because nobody had an idea of who/what he's targetting.
---
Liked the video but those zoom ins are pure AIDS
---
Hi, /u/murmurtoad

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dacj42/im_3_the_mismatched_armor_everyone_is_wearing/). 
---
Yeah still no.
---
I‚Äôll let ya know.
---
no homo
---
Depends on how many of one guild is running the pug. 20 guildies? Yeah Reserving Legendary and maybe weapon drop is fine.
---
5 Guildies? You're pugging man. You can't reserve anything.
---
EPL, Winterspring (tons here), Silithus, Blasted Lands (not much here)
---
This hurts me because back in the day Ardent Custodian was the first BoE epic I ever found and I was leveling a prot warrior.
---
...Not sure I'd buy it for 100 but surely it's worth more than 16.
---
Unfortunately, no, not in classic. I did every Stormwind rep quest I'm aware of up to level 50 and I'm still only 5522/21000 Revered with them as a Human. I doubt it'll be any different for Ironforge reputation.
---
Also, as you noticed, you get reduced reputation for doing quests significantly below you in level. Still, finishing out any Ironforge rep quests you can find from here on out will help ease the pain of the Runecloth turn-ins you're going to have to do later to get your Ironforge reputation up.
---
I‚Äôm 60 now and swapped to succubus as soon as I got her and never looked back, she holds aggro for exactly as long as my voidwalker did while leveling (3 dots then I‚Äôd pull after the first wand attack or first drain life tick) while doing substantially more damage, her cc can occasionally be useful while leveling, and if you go dp she doesn‚Äôt need to use mana as lash of pain wasn‚Äôt much of her damage when I checked and you don‚Äôt want any of her other abilities on autocast anyways.
---
Back in burning crusade my guild's sunwell geared main tank got paid 5000g to tank another guild's SSC run because their MT had an emergency lol
---
You contradicted yourself there. Tanks job is to hold aggro.
---
the guy literally said that they've told him during the first pull. its a guild run, ppl are probably chilling on disc, not that hard to imagine the inviter just forgot to mention or that some guildie warned to reserve stuff after getting few pugs in. its also the right thing to do if u are doing 7 guildies + 3 pugs.
---
honest mistake, nothing more. but keep the circlejerk
---
Have you ever ran a low level dungeon without a tank? lol.
---
its not out yet
---
Camping someone who killed a fishing priest is way more part of the game than killing a fishing priest.
---
And I can garantee you werent laughing while they did that.
---
Seriously what kind of prick attacks a priest while they are fishing and then goes on the internet to complain when they get camped
---
Yeah ya can
---
I main a female gnome warrior named Tiddleywinks. I would say there‚Äôs not enough gnomes!
---
good way to think!
---
So,i just recieved this mail, with 4 gold inside. I pressed Return cause it is one button which logicaly can give you money - reply doing nothing, close is close. And i thought "Return" means return me my money, never saw this button before. But it seems "Return" means return mail back.... With my gold...=/ What can i do?:( Reep gold or what? Why we even have an opportunity to return a mail with money/item back to SYSTEM?
---
It is literally not even entitlement, it is a simple request. You are so ridiculous it hurts.
---
I think this is what happened:
---
You pulled subpar dps. Group kept wiping. Tank left. They pm'd a new tank. Tanks terms were to reserve an item. They agreed. You cried about it. They booted you for a better dps and brought in the tank.
---
As someone who plays on his couch (laptop), thank you. Your idea of a little shelf you can sit everything on is exactly what im looking for. I keep having my mouse slide off my armrest.
---
60 PvP- arms is hands down the spec 2 be..
---
When you need to remove buffs
---
I‚Äôm horde on Skeram. Only level 30 but I noticed barely any alliance in contested zones. Went to hillsbrad excited for some world pvp and just saw a few skulls or level 60s roaming around on their mounts. I have yet to see an alliance around my level. Honestly sucks for both sides.
---
This looks pretty damn chill.
---
Bonus points for the nuggets and gravy.
---
12/10
---
no one wants to be in molten core for 3 hours, that's what happens if you get 5 rets/enh/elemental 5 spriests 5 ferals 5 arms etc
---
that's just how the game is. im sure you can find casual guildies that will gladly take a meme spec, let the others do their thing and stop bitching.
---
-About to roll a warrior
---
-Already planning for 60
---
You‚Äôve a long way to go! Levelling a warrior is hard work.
---
what about max rank claw?
---
Yep...30-40 took me like, a couple of days.  50-60 easily took me over a week.
---
Layers doesn't affect chat =)
---
Can I level as arms to
---
LOL
---
Numlock is autorun
---
If they're bop or already soulbound just equip them and see which one gives you better sheet dps.  Don't listen to other guy who said 7 agi is better, that's like 1dps from atk power and barely any crit... because I assume we're talking about hunter here?  Any other class go for the stats... but if you are a hunter... do you want 21dps plus 1dps and like .2% crit, or 24dps?  Also don't forget you want to use a weapon with a high dmg range to make abilities like multishot do more dmg for the same mana cost, since multishot just adds dmg to your base attack.  Usually it's guns that have the higher dmg range for their level, but shop around there are always exceptions.
---
Or have the whirlwind axe from the lv 30 quest?
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
I said poisons, but nice point about using kidney shot when they transform into healing form. Haven't PvP'd in like 10 years, so my memory is rusty :D
---
This is a pretty specific question, but I have a 144hz main monitor and a 60hz second monitor. Occasionally, when I have something playing on the second one (like twitch, that‚Äôs a particularly bad one) it‚Äôll drop my first monitor to 60hz. Is there a setting you know of to fix that?
---
only dumb og vanilla players think feral tank is a meme
---
So you did it all with runecloth, no quests? This gives me hope
---
With the toes.
---
Just plugged the other day killed every boss with no wipes. Rogues onyl ones who ever really died.
---
Honestly strat pug is harder then mc pug.
---
Shut up you aren‚Äôt even a hunter lol
---
All is fair in war and trying to find 9 of those fucking clams underwater.
---
And it's a duo so they need to find 18 of those suckers.
---
46 in queue, just ahead of me
---
"only"
---
Why are resto druids are supposed to be in bear form they have a +10 rage talent, I tell you what, instead of sitting here arguing with someone about a 15 year old game, just go get the data and put it up. That'll be a good way to show me how wrong I am! Download recount, get to 60, run your raids and see how you do and report back.
---
Why, it‚Äôs correct, materiel refers to military equipment, as apposed to material which is civilian.
---
yeah i know :/ enjoy your cheetos m8
---
Blameaux has the Babel Bus.
---
Hunter cos of all the pets.
---
Nuggets!!
---
Westside Noggers on Noggenfogger but they had to change the name
---
Huh?
---
My rotation is MB - SW:P - MF - wanding. Awesome dps and not any problems with mana.
---
he can still buy a regular faction mount. going without an epic mount for several months would be awful.
---
Sweeeeaty Alliance. Rofl.
---
Yep. The entirety of Lordaeron used to be the Amani empire before the humans and elves pushed them off.
---
This obviously took a lot of effort and other people seem to love it, but my god, the style of editing and effects on this video is fucking awful for my tastes. Literally couldn't watch more than 20 seconds of it.   
---
   
---
Again though, seems like you have a lot of fans here in the comments so cheers to your effort.
---
Is it a lot harder then mage
---
Naw.. Look at the forums for the lower pop realms. It's all people complaining about the lack of people to play with/a working economy and/or regrets from people who deferred from a high-top server and now wish they could go back. Long-term high pop servers will get better and eventually will have no queue. Long-term low-post servers will become ghost towns that you wont be able to leave without rerolling...
---
Where is your threat meter ?
---
I know that, thanks but I want to copy stuff from chat, quest tracker and then paste them into a web browser, is that possible?
---
You'll want to be arms for PvP, sometimes prot is nice as a FC in BGs but arms is a powerhouse in organized PvP with MS being God tier. Stances are pretty simple, you start out with just battle stance which is your base line stance and doesn't have any direct bonuses or negatives. At level 10 you will get defensive stance which provides +10% damage reduction at the cost of 10% of your damage, you also generate 50% more threat in defensive stance than the other two, even though the tool tip doesn't say it. At level thirty you will get access to berzerker stance, which provides 3% increased chance to crit in exchange for 10% increased damage taken. As you level and learn abilities you will notice that certain abilities require certain stances, this is where stance-dancing comes in. Stance dancing is basically switching stances as you fight in order to use abilities restricted to other stances. For example charge can only be used in battle stance and intercept can only be used in berzerker stance. As you level, and you'll want to do so as arms which is 2h focused, you'll spend most of your time in berzerker stance after 30 for the increased chance to crit, only switching to battle stance for charge and overpower procs. When you run instances however you'll want to be in defensive stance, only using charge to open and then switching to defensive stance, maybe also using the occasional thunderclap in battle stance. Keep in mind however, you need to spec into tactical mastery otherwise you will lose all your rage when you switch stances, tactical mastery allows you to retain up to 25.
---
Those are the basics, keep in mind though warriors are the hardest class to level solo so be prepared to struggle from time to time. 
---
Some additional tips I can provide:
---
 The most important stat when choosing a weapon is damage range, followed my AP. Many people will say speed and this is correct to an extent as generally slower weapons have higher damage ranges to compensate for their speed, but don't turn down a weapon purely because it has a fast speed, of the damage range is higher then it's still an upgrade. 
---
Remember all that is necessary to tank dungeons is defensive stance and sometimes a sword/board, but a 2h will suffice and is actually preferable in some situations. 
---
Do not spread your talent points out pre 30/40 unless you like to spend gold on respecs as you want sweeping strikes and mortal strike ASAP.
---
Try and plan your weapon upgrades out and have an idea of what you want to get and when. The reason this important is the arms tree has different specs for different weapon types, with axe/polearm generally being the best/most reliable. 
---
To elaborate on why weapon damage range is so important; many of your key abilities as a warrior are based off of weapon damage and are instant cast. These being things like overpower, mortal strike, and whirlwind. So since slow weapons do more damage so too will your abilities do more damage and since they are instant use they are not effected by speed.
---
Let me know if you have any other questions and good luck!
---
Claw or Bite it doesn‚Äôt matter. Yeah get the highest rank but Its all just focus dump anyways. Get stamina and skip armor. Get resistance instead
---
People are paying more attention to racials for PvP now, gnomes are more represented than they used to be for sure.
---
If I had to choose which ones to max it'd be the ones I mentioned, any damaging abilities would be an afterthought.
---
What‚Äôs the point in making new posts complaining about something you have complete control over?
---
On a moonlit run to the midnight sun; that‚Äôs the magic of the night.
---
Yes, this is essentially going from one of the easiest to the most difficult to level solo.
---
Hey I'd just like to point out that this is the first result when searching 
---
"druids proc chance on hit weapons"
---
on google.
---
Sometimes its better for new information and for it to be up to date and correct.
---
Just a thought for the mindless "repost, go google it" mentality.
---
Daggers are definitely better offhand once you get poison and before you go sword spec talent since you can find daggers with lower atk speeds than swords at the same dps levels.  Main should always be swords or maces now that you're hitting mid teens, their dmg range pulls ahead of daggers hard and fast.
---
I think this would be a fun leveling experience honestly.  I recently befriended someone in game and we‚Äôve been trying to stay in synch.  Life gets in the way though lol.
---
Thats pretty dope
---
Hahahahahahahaahahhahahahahah
---
If the realms become empty. Blizz will offer xfers. There are zero low pop realms rn. Please try again.
---
lol... RPPVP... the server type they didn't even consider releasing originally, is full.
---
I main a rogue, I‚Äôve played wow since vanilla but I‚Äôve never played wow until classic, I love being able to gank allies and escape if I‚Äôm in danger, love distracting people in booty bay and feel really good about my damage! Lockpicking and poisons are fun too
---
Dire Maul east and north comes out. You will be able to farm lashers very quickly, locking yourself out. But lo, just enter Dire Maul North too and you can kill bugs and hyenas too preventing you from locking out.
---
On pservers the problem of handfarming chinese and eastern europeans selling gold got to so bad they nerfed it to preserve the economy.

this is now my new favorite thing for about a week.
---
druids have abolish poison :/
---
yea. revered gets you 15%, though. and that is relatively easily to get by 60 for most factions.
---
theres really no way to get exalted without buying several hundred stacks of runecloth. kind of defeats the purpose to save 50g on the mount.
---
its not 'immolate and dots' it's corruption immo conflag shadowburn and a soul fire. its also +200 fire damage.
---
Arms is hands down the best spec to level in.
---
I‚Äôm down. PM me. I‚Äôm on Atiesh and will play whatever.
---
Worth mentioning if you‚Äôre NA or EU (or OC) servers.
---
I like to use words.  House or something like that, short and easy to remember, also easy to type.
---
The hardcore guilds knew that druids gear quicker and can tank easier with shitter gear and we're using them week 1 :)
---
Best way to level!
---
Yeah that‚Äôs absurd. Idk how you wouldn‚Äôt take that.
---
? :(
---
Just add a controller to it instead of a keyboard and mouse and you are set.
---
The painful thing with this video/guild is that you dont have windfury...
---
Feral Druids love that shit
---
Keep downvoting bro. So petty.
---
I'm not even wrong. Being patient and getting another opinion from someone who knows their stuff is the smart thing to do and the other post was fine aswell... I think you are shooting off target here.
---
As an arms or fury warrior you can swap in a shield as you need to.
---
I use my 2H to get initial threat and if I'm taking lots of melee damage I equip a shield and 1H and use shield block etc.  If the healer has plenty of mana and my hp isn't chunking then I can swap back to my 2H and do more damage and threat.
---
A lot of classic warrior tanking is learning to be dynamic and pick the right ability for your situation.
---
There's a balance between reducing the damage you take so you don't die or strain the healer, and doing high damage and threat so the DPS can do more damage and the pack or boss dies quicker thus the healer needs to spend less mana.
---
A lot of this will come with practice using your abilities, experience knowing your defensive limits and knowledge of dungeons and encounters.  You can start whenever you want though, try stance and shield swapping in the open world if you want to get the hang of it!
---
I dont get it. Tou think people who on purpose, through inability to read chat and listen. Who makes the dungeon run more difficult should get loot?
---
If it's duo then going pally won't be rough. First 20 levels are kind of painful but once you get into Inspiration it's much more straightforward.
---
Belt is a nightmare to get. That shitty green belt drops every time
---
Thanks slipped my mind ill be adding that in.

Congratulations that took me so long to get 14 years ago but I still cherish the memory. Treat that majestic saber well my friend
---
I have to agree, epic PvP mount money at that level playing so few hours, bullshit
---
Snack are too far away.
---
Just keep questing, that's gonna be the easiest way to earn mount money
---
yes I'm on faerlina
---
How do you make the nameplates over the characters like that? I've been looking for an add-on to make it look modern but without like an entire UI overall. Looks like you have that. Thanks!
---
They already have 2 warriors, why do you need more? UBRS is basically a joke with 10, I've co-tanked it as a bear at 58. Sounds like these guys still dont want to respec from arms/fury but still want all the prot gear. Disgusting.
---
Varian is still a prisoner in classic. Strange he's managing the bank.
---
In case this isn't a joke, that was from a player and you returned their gold to them.
---
You would slaughter kittens??? The Alliance really are cruel
---
Warrior priest is almost unstoppable.
---
Plus you won't be forced to choose alliance.
---
&gt;Dungeons, and action the gear.
---
Yeah this guy is obviously retarded.

At work, we have glass panels for doors everywhere and on the bottom is a bunch of 1's and 0's written accross the whole bottom 2 feet all the way accross as part of a design pattern.

When you have a certain amount of heirlooms (scaling leveling gear that gives bonus exp), you get a chauffeured moint that you can use pre 20 or 30 (can't remember when they let you buy a mount).
---
Kuinameplates
---
What? And you dont.
---
&gt;How do I switch stances easily and fast?
---
You can just create a macro for each one (e.g /cast Battle Stance) warriors can benefit pretty heavily from macros and I recommend looking into them as you level. A nice beginner macro that I usually recommend to new warriors is:
---
/Cast Battle Stance
---
/Cast charge
---
/Cast overpower
---
By binding all three of these abilities to one key you save yourself a ton of room and simplify things for yourself. To explain, you must be in battle stance to cast charge or overpower, charge can only be used out of combat, overpower can only be used directly following a Dodge. So what this means is if you are already in battle stance that will be ignored and you will just use charge if you are out of combat or overpower if you're in combat and your enemy just dodged. You'll also want to have a macro to equip a 2h/switch to a 1h + shield, but I don't want to overwhelm you too much. For now the easiest way to swap stances is to make a macro for each one and bind them to easy, preferably adjacent keys, I have mine on shift 1,2 and 3.
---
 &gt;And what do u mean by dont spread your talents out prem 30/40
---
I mean stay in the arms tree and don't spread out into fury or protection until after you have gotten mortal strike and sweeping strikes at a minimum.
---
Yeah I'm in.basically we will start at the same time. Whenever you/I need fo get off we both get off. If I'm online, pm me and I'll switch to out duo and we will play that. As long as  either of us play the duo by ourselves it will work fine. We can think of it as an alt.
---
I got em. 4 pieces of the set, gonna do a combo of 6 + other bis If I can to drop, don‚Äôt have skinning and only 200g off my epic mount from only a few days farming... I want bis, but devisaur /leather prices and some of those drops are horrific
---
So yes.
---
Lol, I was questing the other day, 3 horde. Nearby are a group of questing 4 alliance.
---
We settle in, they jump us mid fight so we rez and fight them. They're higher but we're better at pvp, focus them down etc and we get them all with one casualty.
---
We go back to questing, as far as we're concerned it's even and we taught them not to mess with us while we quest. They rez, I wave to indicate peace and turn away. Warlock summons in a lvl 60 and then they jump us mid combat. Because levels, a 60, and 2 more aren't enough they need the combat advantage too *rolls eyes*.
---
Alliance honour!
---
What's your plan in the future in regards end game? PVE? Pure PvP? Remember that changing specs is not as friendly in classic.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt swap to the ruin build until 60. If you like affliction stick with it but the demonology build can rly up ur dps in dungeons by sacrificing the sucubus. You still keep ~15 points in affliction for improved CoA and other damage talents.
---
Hydration waterlords? Guess that makes sense
---
Didn‚Äôt even check my AH before I equipped. Damn !
---
Did you even read his comment?
---
what kind of problem is this lol
---
you cut Kevin Hart one second too short, we both know which part, lol.
---
arise, my champion
---
Yep I‚Äôm only 52, so I got plenty of time to check ah and slowly chip away at the rep with cheap runecloth buys from now till lvl 60. Grats though dude!
---
Just quest and sell greens. If you still don't have it at 40, go to SM and pick pockets/open boxes you get.
---
Balancing reasons.
---
"only epic so far"
---
I played a bit over a year in vanilla and never had an epic drop. Maybe I was just unlucky but I feel like i can't be the I ly one not seeing epics drop from time to time in my loot Window?
---
Wait seriously, all these people didn‚Äôt know about this!?
---
I‚Äôve been doing this for years on Retail and Vanilla I thought everyone one knew!
---
oh gawd... not again
---
first time I ever see how BL even looks like
---
and Ive been playing for more than a decade
---
Swim from Westfall to booty Bay, then take the boat, run south a bit from ratchet. Done.
---
Paladin-warrior is a brutal pvp combo. Amazing heals and dispels. Blessing of freedom. Sacrifice etc. auras for easy interchangeable resistances. Put together a Bis plate healing set for armor andesrm goblin engineering for sappers
---
That's why you make an Int set, not a spell power set for Holy Nova farming.
---
Roll priest, go shadow, tell your friend to go arms, proceed to wreck your way to 60.
---
Why
---
No thanks, i wont inv you as a ret to my mc pug, no matter how much u lobby it. Ret is trash.
---
üòÇ
---
You think your doing bad?
---
I main hunter.
---
I do it all the time to mess with rogues. Sometimes they decide to push my shit in after if I don't keep track of them.
---
Fair's fair I suppose :)
---
It makes me wonder why druids seem to be one of the least played class with all the utlity they have to offer.
---
That's so weird to see as someone who played vanilla. Back in the day I knew a dude who had Timbermaw Hold and Wintersaber Trainers exalted and that was considered amazing and the dude was considered a no-lifer on the server.
---
I can still here it behind me... \*shudders\*
---
Your not wrong at all. That is fucked up
---
idk i think thunder bluff and undercity are actually pretty fucking shitty. TB because it's fucking cliffs and you can't go between the zones without going to the center, and then undercity..ugh. navigating it is a nightmare.
---
You can have both quests at the same time, but they send you to different areas (off most races I believe)
---
Rogue
---
being able to stealth makes it feel like a whole different game
---
I got skinning sold everything of value I found on the ah skipped my skills did 90% questing and was 20g short at 40.  I think not having mount at 40 is the norm unless you go to extra effort to get it by 40
---
Yeti cave is the new stv arena.

Fight me.

IN THE FUCKING YETI CAVE
---
Which folders do I need to sync between two PCs for keybinds, macros, addons and UI options?
---
All of the WTF?
---
Most, if not all mobs have substantial fire resistance. Only Geddon and Ragnaros himself are outright immune to fire i believe.
---
Reminds me of the rescue service you could hire if you ever got stranded somewhere in the galaxy in Elite: Dangerous.
---
You returned the money to sender
---
If you use Necrosis, you can set it up to use any bag as the "soul shards bag" and limit the max it will keep.  It will delete extras if either the bag gets full or if you exceed the amount to keep.
---
You could say frost is the specialisation meta and that there is then a meta frost build inside of that.
---
Still meta though, it's turtles all the way down.
---
The word refers any concept behind the concept in question, to the next degree of abstraction.
---
The phrase "cookie cutter build" is simply less esoteric, and of course far less applicable to general usage.
---
"Advanced" language allows you to say more with less. Unfortunately, what is gained in precision and efficiency is lost in comprehensibility from the perspective of a general audience unfamiliar with the terms.
---
Oh nice do you use immolate on affliction or no because of the increased cast time. On my desto I would try to start with and immolate and a quick curse/affliction then fear and shadow bolt or searing pain.
---
Finally? Are you kidding or haven't you realized yet that those movies are pretty much universally hated?
---
Looks like a modern Roald Dahls shed set up
---
There is a very big, relatively circular room with the floor covered in water and a bunch of waterfalls. That room as a triangular but sticking out towards Princess' room. If the other person stands at the very edge of the map in that triangle as close to Princess as possible, and if you kill Princess by the wall closest to that triangle, the other person is in master loot range.
---
Grinding is the key. Grind green mobs, skin them, loot everything, as a rogue pick pocket everything. From lvl36 I only grinded mobs till 40, had 110g at the end. Doesn't buy spells which you don't need for lvling. Just don't spend gold.
---
Fairbanks wpvp is heating up as people level. I'm quite pleased.
---
Just buy that shit and vendor it. Easiest money ever.
---
Any idea what's going on here?  
---
I noticed when entering the Sepulcher's crypt/inn, that I briefly became invisible.  While filming, the Tauren that ran by also briefly disappeared.  Has this been brought up before? I wasn't able to find anything when googling/searching here.
---
Sounds risky. Especially if you add the opposing faction.
---
whAAt
---
ok well thats that then. I just wanted to hear other peoples opinions and I get it. you believe we are both douches, I think you are wrong, but thats OK. no need to discuss more. Thank you for your words regardless.
---
I used imo from 1-10, then vw exclusively 10-60 including dungeons. I wasn‚Äôt always as concerned with damage output, sometimes you run into a bad tank, or just some extras mobs on the healers that no one can deal with immediately.  
---
So vw can be sent in for emergency taunts, or sac him when the rest of your team wipes and the boss in running at you.
---
Love this text

Smh all these people taking photos of their screen.. take a screenshot

End game PVE content will probably be reserved for my horde Warlock, together with the guild I raided with in vanilla. So probably casual pve and pvp.

Arumba's playthroughs of EU4 using [PiP](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg?hl=en) while grinding out quests.

Do you know the name of the service or channel?
---
Garbage team.  Good on OP for rolling the hell out of there, life's too short for dipshits... and tanking is too much of a pain in the ass to do it for no chance of reward.
---
See your guild around.  My 28 rogue is not looking very roguey yet, so I feel ya
---
Whenever I go to the hardware store it for sure feels like all the employees are already layer-hopping hard to avoid customers.
---
God damn Smolderweebs.
---
Depends on your spec sm/ ds can do it no problem. Sm/ ruin still pretty easy with decent greens maybe a few 60 blues
---
I haven't had any issues with Necrosis and Luna Unit Frames working together.  I wouldn't expect LunaFrames to have an issue with Omnicc, but haven't tried.
---
During questing? 2-4. Bagspace is just too valuable. One for succubus, one ss, one hs.
---
I didn't even equip the 12 slot soul shard bag.
---
I guess all critique is.... Idk where you're going with your post. Glhf
---
To answer your question, as I don't see the answer here in the comments: It stems from the "tradition" of the RL saying over &lt;insert voice comms name here&gt; : "Place + in the chat if you are ready/doing &lt;thing&gt;/have &lt;thing&gt; etc.

Highest security card is even funnier.  Go look it up.

why are these type of ppl always saying things like "relax"? are they subconsciously saying that to themselves?

Did you trade / sent gold via mail? Ever on either account? - Yes or no. - If yes, how much? Because if you exceeded an unknown specific amount that might be the cause.

Hippity hoppity get off my property
---
many secrets lie within the tomb.
---
oooo okay
---
Yeah, I should've noted that the rest of the comment was fine. It just irks me that people think warriors can't dps: They can, they're very good at it even in arms, it's just that warrior tanks just don't like having competition.
---
Only killing boars until 60
---
and the mobs are dead before it even ticks a noticble amount
---
Wow you got the joke.....
---
This sub
---
We got  lost a lot.

just to be clear, youre suggesting NOT purchasing a focus dump?

Tank bubbled himself? That's why the group's dead

If you ever kill a mage one on one as a ret paladin, the mage may be borderline mentally disabled.
---
I sent both my brothers 7g and a bunch of bags that I tailored.
---
Saw this guy earlier. Thought it was neat
---
I'm suggesting if the choice is between greater stamina rank 7 or claw rank 4, claw is staying at 3.
---
Oh man, I've killed people just because I wanted a soul shard before. Really makes you feel like a villain.
---
Sorry. Immolate, dots, and an extremely inefficient 6 second cast. You're not doing 300 dps with your meme spec guy. I played lock in vanilla and I wanted fire to be viable back then too for a while, but it isn't.
---
Yeah thats 1/2 true. I always found that phrase sort of funny and hadnt seen it used since 15 years ago. The context felt appropriate although it was not necessary.
---
I mean itsnlike 2 Rends when it applies and as a warrior ,i dont kill mobs that fast loo
---
You know what the joke is. Dont act like there aren't anomalies for every single stereotype ever made lol
---
I dunno, I wore my lvl 29 bracers all the way to 60.
---
Absolutely, disarm for example is tied to defensive stance, intercept (in combat charge) and pummel (interrupt) are both tied to berzerker stance, and retaliation, sweeping strikes, and overpower are all tied to battle stance. Switching stances is a core mechanic of playing a warrior and is basically required for both pve and PvP to differing extents.
---
[Pepsi Bottle? A Coca-Cola glass? I don't give a damn](https://youtu.be/fiDmp1HkHK8)
---
DS is only good in raid because your pet will always be dead anyway. When you can use your pet there's no reason to sacrifice it. MD + succubus will do more dmg than sacrificed succubus, especially when you aoe a lot.
---
Hey, thanks. I'm going to call them tomorrow and try to talk to a supervisor. I'll keep this thread posted on what happens.
---
This quest aged just the right amount.
---
gz to 700g
---
So basically I have to switch stances just to interrupt a caster or to do damage etc..? Seems like an annoying mechanic. Does it sound more annoying then it is.
---
You do. Bt and ww and hs above 70 rage hs above 90 rage.
---
I haven't even opened tinder since classic came out. All I can think is, "What if I actually meet someone? That's going to seriously cut into my play time."
---
Yes , it can drop

---
Not that impressive
---
Uhh. I mean maybe it's a priest thing, but raw amount of time was way faster 51-60
---
I agree with everything except mages mages being the easiest. I wouldn't say they're the hardest either, but I think a paladin is probably the easiest lol
---
I still had one.
---
Well I bet most of the people that are lvl 60 and have epic mounts put alot of time and effort into this. I work full time, go to the gym, meet friends and have to do things like cook and clean. I am mid lvl 30s now and I play pretty efficient in my mind. I think it's insane that there are so many people already lvl 60 and with epic mounts. They most play 5+ hours every day
---
Your brothers gold? I need you to be more specific and detailed on that. Because it could be interpreted as money laundry.. - Even though it is a fairly small amount, but is it all of your brothers gold, then it's still suspicious. But like I said, more details on just about everything on that is important.
---
Thogg for warchief 2020.
---
I'd wear that shirt.
---
look for class specific discords. the warrior one is called fight club and its huge, most big brain theorycrafters are there, simm spreadsheet and everything
---
??? 
---
You have a mount and you are doing endgame dungeons / WPL, EPL, Winterspring.. the grind is minimal.
---
Lol u need to buy gear on ah to level a Warrior? You're the one who's a trash Warrior lmaoo
---
Okay that's pretty nice. Probably fun for the people doing it too.
---
Have you tried whispering those tanks? I am also a tank and the only people outside my guild I do runs with is people that ask me and who I remember from leveling. If they had a good experience with you they might not respond to lfg but might respond to a whisper.

Im sorry to say, bit tauren can‚Äôt ride darkspear raptor :(

Impossible to get gold excet if you live online? Theres so much you can do without hving to be online 24/7.

Farm mighty rage potion recipe. Recipe alone nets 10-20g and the mobs that drop it, drop a lot of grey weapons, rune cloth and there are chests all over the place. Nets me around 70g/hour
---
Farm dreamfoil, 13g = stack and it takes 20min to get it. With the occasional black lotus.
---
Devilsaur nets around 70g an hour with just standing still. Needs to be done at unconventional times tho.
---
If you are range you can do maraudon princess runs solo that net 60g/hour.
---
This x 100 the unholy carnage in and around that cave is biblical.

When saying low level questers I'm assuming pre-contested zones.

Mywilly needs more than a dick. PvP server?
---
Not even kidding when I say at least 90% of me getting ganked by a ???? was by a gnome mage or any sort of warlock. They must have to sacrifice their humanity to become a lock or something.

I don't play alliance but you will definitely notice and it is a big deal. The only thing you can do is be aware when you're fighting an orc and be ready with a new plan when you're shit gets resisted
---
It's also the most brutal PvP server I've ever been on. Only place I've seen people avoid fighting is in the water.
---
It is glorious.  But you have to strap your shit kickers on extra tight because some has your number, and it seems like everyone has a stealthed buddy and the over populated mage glut is making them suicidal.  
---
It's the perfect server, had 6 awesome WPvP fights tonight alone.
---
Right like this have never been an issue for me. I'll let them speed pull as long as I'm able to sustain mana but once I dip low enough to the point where I won't be able to heal the next pull I just say "mana" and 100% of the time everyone will stop and wait for me to drink.
---
I play Horde, but these cowards deserve what they got.
---
Should have drowned them though for the durability loss
---
I'd definitely disagree about Thunderbluff. In terms of layout it's one of the better ones in my opinion.
---
Most things are clustered in the main rise, you've got your AH and Bank very close together with a mailbox nearby. All the profession trainers (bar First aid) are within 50 yards of each other. 
---
It's big let down is location, since it's a decent flight away from a continent switch and all the good Kalimdor stuff is down south.
---
Undercity I'd agree is a nightmare to wrap your head around. It's not a bad layout per se, but it's really hard to keep your bearings when you're looking for something.
---
30-40 was 1h a level. 50-60 is a lot slower.
---
I would have told them to fuck themselves a long time ago.
---
Very much how like you‚Äôre acting now!
---
Yea every one of these players are definitely no lifers. Which is fine of course. I'll never judge anyone on their preferred lifestyle
---
I wouldn't. Since you should rarely use SotC anyways, just put the talent points elsewhere.
---
Having gold for your epic mount when you ding 60 isn't normal or efficient imo
---
These chests are bad
---
I am happy to just get a 1.98g great axe from them
---
nope
---
Well, russians/russian-speaking players ARE often discriminated against in online games/culture... so interacting with them might be a tad more prone to misunderstandings.
---
dark pact is too good for leveling. juicy shadow bolt crits are cool, but dark pact essentially doubles your mana bar which is more health while soloing.
---
you don't even have to do 9/21/21 for raiding at 60 if you don't want to. you can stick with 30/0/21 because most raids want at least one warlock with an imp for stamina buff.
---
it is only 5% less shadow damage, but depending on your raid comp/fight you might get to cast corruption for nightfall procs, and on some fights your imp can do a little bit of dps. some fights like ony phase 2 you can usually keep up corruption + sl for 30% of the fight, so that 5% less damage on shadowbolt is not that big of a deal.
---
plus side: better soloing, and the spec isn't completely terrible for pvp.
---
I can't tell who is gnoming either.
---
And if he started acting the way he did to that guy, I wouldn't make a reddit post about it.
---
Damage is literally the d in dps
---
I guess I'm confused.  Did you guys have it on free-for-all loot?  Under what circumstance does a rare item not trigger a group roll?  Being in combat shouldn't hide your chance to roll on it unless you have an addon that hides it for some reason.
---
Tbh, later expansions made a lot of old addon features baseline
---
That's not resulting in a net positive. Eventually you'll need to eat or drink.
---
Would you be so kind and prepare a second one right next to it? I would join asap :)
---
I know they say dont feed the trolls but this one really triggered me. lmao
---
No you‚Äôd just keep commenting on the post like you are now lmao
---
15 agility one from a Maraudon Quest you can som for at 47
---
You will get there. I got my mount at 41 as a warrior. Just put some stuff on the auction house, vendor the other items and don't train abilities that you aren't going to use.
---
I am new to classic *(played only during wotlk and legion)* and decided to roll a Warlock. 31 atm and I am enjoying every second. No one dares to fight me in open pvp and if they try I usually win, after my first fear goes of. I am currently leveling with a voidwalker but I am curious about the drain tanking build so I will try it out.
---
$500 token, for what reason? Close to none spends $500 in one go
---
so the new details update shows players talent trees while inspecting, is there a way to disable this feature?
---
Cool. I chose the Orb. Thank you for the weapon suggestion for Hypnotic. I forgot that was in SM
---
Responding to people supporting him as if he did nothing wrong, yep. Keep defending shitty behavior though.
---
Ok, chose the Orb. Thank you
---
That is some terrible customer service.
---
1.5g per hour is terrible.
---
This quest isn‚Äôt awful at all. It‚Äôs truly the most fun I‚Äôve had since vanilla and I had to go back on 3 separate days trying to complete it cause time it was battled into a stalemate where neither side could finish it. 
---
Between us dispelling each other and just out right killing other groups if they started it first, purely to fail the quest and start the red pawn timer faster. 
---
It‚Äôs shitty quest design, but amazing for world pvp.
---
I wanna be Rexxar. I'd fight king Mosh over copy write infringement.
---
Oooof. High level Feral Druids just run it later on to get a powerful consumable item. But I agree Gnomer is far from a good dungeon, I think I only ever ran it a handful of times.
---
also the 5% increased intelligence which is good for all casters regardless of pve or pvp...
---
And Old Hillsbrad Foothills instance
---
I'm right behind you! Lvl 39,5, never played wow, and well on my way to mount money
---
Aoe only works if the whole group is down for it and the comp makes it works. If not standard pulls all the way.
---
That comparison is incredibly dumb
---
If I understand correctly, he doesn‚Äôt even have an EU account. He created an US account WHILE in EU. He played on US from EU, and kept playing on US when he came back to Canada. At least this is how I understand the story!
---
Not sure why you got downvoted...
---
Anyway, a few things in my opinion:
---
TB proc is better than LGS proc.
---
Dropping Vanq means you lose AP overall on average.
---
LGS MH and TB OH would mean your MH is slower than your OH... /gasp.
---
I‚Äôm no expert but try TB MH, LGS OH? Your sheet will still show a dps decrease as it doesn‚Äôt account for procs.
---
What? No
---
For a level 22 it isn‚Äôt really that bad. And it‚Äôs funny for you to talk shit about what I made being a lie and then talk shit again about it being bad. Go get a life
---
yeah, im just upset cause there is a button "lose ur money", thats all :( ok,i see, reep 4 gold
---
Was more going for stuff available during vanilla but yes that too :)
---
Mind explaining how to solo Mara as a lock? I‚Äôm 56 and would love to know
---
I do not believe that you have 1000 gold at level 46. You just don't have the means to farm that quickly unless that's literally all you do and even then... Did you get lucky with epic drops?
---
Whatever dude, think what you want.
---
How does esfand top dps meters as ret then? I don't like the guy but he's always beating all other dps
---
Yeah, what‚Äôs up with all these vids being way longer than they need to be x.x
---
well,dunno, i always clicked "open all" button and in mails with items there are no "return button",so i never saw it before :(  
---
sigh.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Unfortunately LGS is mainhand-only, you can‚Äôt put it in the offhand slot :(
---
The flavor text should be:
---
"Please hit the shiny bits"
---
No imagine this on a tauren.
---
This makes me want to make a 39 twink lock and do world pvp in stv
---
Yeah, that's exactly how it was.
---
For a level 22 doing literally nothing but killing npcs it‚Äôs pretty decent. I enjoy the experience of the game, you clearly enjoy telling others what they do is terrible
---
got the screenshot
---
but sender is System...why there is a thing to accidentaly send them back to system?=/ thats  just dumb(
---
he can raid as 30/0/21 because most groups will want at least one imp buff. even if a raid doesn't particularly need an imp buff, the 5% less shadow damage isn't exactly a game breaking loss for ony/mc.
---
plus, better dps in 5 mans and a better time soloing.
---
Honestly just levelling to 60 and being frugal can get you to around that amount without too much trouble.
---
0.99 to the power of how many mobs you're fighting. So against 16 mobs you'd have a 85% chance of no mobs resisting your frost nova.
---
I thought it was just me!
---
Just in case you don‚Äôt know, being in front of the enemy *does* make a difference as far as them potentially seeing you. At level 11 I remember walking in front of an enemy in stealth almost never working
---
I don't know which nameplate addon this is, but I like NeatPlates. It makes them look... neat.
---
Well 2 things you have to remember. 
---
1. your a in the raid because your supporting the warlocks
---
2. Your rotation doesnt really change with gear, you signed up for shadow priest so you accept that your last on the gear totem pole
---
All my friends are jealous. My friends are killing bosses and I‚Äôm looking at weird flowers in dungeons like... WTF IS THIS??
---
Except for Bloodfang.
---
This is fucking killing me.  I hate to spec into balance because it's such garbage, but I can't think of anything as funny as this in WoW.
---
Gross
---
Had same experience: headed to drywhisker gorge on Arathi met a few hordies one by one, helped all of em with their mobs (i was careful not to steal anything). Then at one point they all happened to come to one place inside that cave, where i was mining that sweet iron ore. They were pretty sweet each by themselves, but joined in a trio they suddenly turned hostile. Ganked me to bits (they were a few levels above me except one guy, who was a few lower). When I ressed, the lowbie guy was not there but the two other traitors were still there. I showed em the error of their ways in a way only a rogue can. Well, it was not that spectacular, i killed one guy while blinding the other and then I didn't have enough hp to beat the second guy, so I bailed. Still, was the first time I came against two people and emerged somewhat victorious!
---
He's horde
---
you likely wont
---
the people that get it by 60 typically get real lucky with bis epics
---
Wtf did you even just say
---
Why didn't you pop Blood Fury?
---
When do you use Immolate? I get that you open with Curse of Agony then Corruption but after when do you use Immolate instead of Sbolt? Also if against multiple targets whether it be open world or dungeons how do warlocks fight? Do they get all their dots on the first then second then third etc. and then Sbolt down the first target until they're dead then move to the 2nd target or do they only focus on the first target then once he's dead the 2nd and then the 3rd?
---
I mean.. DS is pretty good if you are farming demons. Sac pet, enslave demon- best of both worlds
---
That is my friend. :-D we share a lot of things in the game and he spends it on stupid shit, lol.
---
It could be a player who named themselves like that and tried to gift you some gold. I've never seen something like that
---
Absolutely, I've got no problems with reserving but let people know what they are signing up for. If it's not in the LFG shouts then your 100% gonna end up wasting someone's time.
---
lmao minecraft bow
---
This. 1000g is a lofty goal for a fully geared level 60, let alone one who just got dinged. The epic mount is not like the level 40 mount and is generally considered much more of a luxury.
---
Ayy, a fellow gnome.
---
Represent!
---
Funniest thing is rogues or hunters: ¬´LFM Tank lbrs omokk and shadowhunter farm, Xbow reserved¬ª :) aka the only thing a tank would want off these 2 bosses
---
Why no aura, blessing or LoH use?
---
I'd love to see that log.
---
I played priest back in vanilla, I went healing because its easier to get into raids and also the priest class gears are all healing gears.
---
I went shadow in bc for raids because it became more viable and disc for arena.
---

---
You are not wrong.
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
This.  Op lost all credibility.  The irony of calling the other guy unstable.
---
this setup is peak gnome
---
This particular boss encounter has the drop in a chest. There's no loot roll window. 
---
That said, I'm pretty sure that you have to confirm wanting to loot it before it actually ends in your bags. So the person knowingly took it.
---
Yes it does, for example you won't be able to see messages in general from people on another layer
---
they blacklist whole guilds of fare skippers too
---
Did it suck to no longer have any chance on Viscidus?
---
Yeah reil because you are getting into instances 2-5 levels above your level. Our pleeb dps have to get to appropriate levels before getting the invites üò£
---
I Wouldn't know specifically about holy pallys but yeah would've said some of the guides on YouTube would have sections on pre bis gear, however it seems like you've tried that. There is always good classic info on Google so if you're not hung up on someone finding the info and presenting it to you in a nice little video I'd suggest jumping on Google
---
Pretty sure tauren can ride Rivendare's mount.
---
Yup, dealt with this just yesterday in MC.  Mageblade in BIS for paladin healers, expect them to roll on this item.
---
He's not complaining at all.
---
No one is obligated to group with you, by the same standard however you are not obligated to not do everything in your power to ensure you get the tag first.
---
Substance abuse therapist checking in. I have a personal gaming addiction background as well. I‚Äôll try to give an explanation with large sweeping statements that deserve more subjective evaluation (therapy or counseling for your brother)
---
Presumably, if your brother is diagnosed bipolar, he very likely had a psychotic break. Psychotic breaks just so happens to be most common in people aged from late teens to twenty something adults. Bipolar education for friends and family is important (there‚Äôs a type 1 and type 2). But to simplify it, his emotional regulation is probably irregular. He communicates differently (and I‚Äôm sure challenging)
---
If we were to dig at it, he may have had an experience or experiences that brought on the psychotic break. A sort of trauma. Somehow, he has come to the conclusion that playing WoW is more rewarding than other options in his life. gaming addiction can be rewarding for a number of reasons.  Familiarity. A system of rewards. A socially safe space. Purpose. It‚Äôs different for everyone. 
---
Here‚Äôs the kicker tho. Ultimately, he has to come to the conclusion that he needs to do some different in his own brain before he would be ready for any long lasting change. Especially for behavioral addictions (though we could argue that the dopamine reward thing is essentially chemical). 
---
If he uses his mental health as a crutch, he will be fighting an uphill battle. 
---
Your parents are indeed enabling him, and that‚Äôs a hard conversation in its own right.
---
Treatment options are out there, but for you, I‚Äôd recommend  free Al Anon meetings. Go to just one. Even though it‚Äôs a support group  for family and friends of alcoholics, you‚Äôll find that most addictions fall under the same umbrella of impacting relationships.
---
These things often need individualized care (in my opinion I guess) but I wish you and your family the best of luck. PM me if you have any private questions.
---
No! I saved every copper!
---
Do people buy prebis boes before epic mount?
---
2 Hunters, 1 lock, 1 mage and a priest RFC easy xD
---
How was farming Mara? I‚Äôm level 56 atm, looking forward to getting in there
---
Taunt on a 10 second cooldown. Tanks can't hold aggro if you're not single target focusing.
---
p sure this was a private server thing that has been discredited by devs
---
Go to the wow support page
---
I'm just going to get exalted with Stormpike when BGs are released.
---
The nuggets are so far away from you dude.
---
While I agree that people should group, it's not mandated. If I have a few mobs left to go I see no reason to split up the exp and loot when I'm leaving so soon.
---
It does? Are you running a beta build or something? Mine doesn't do that o.o
---
You must not have raided with 2.0 in but door locked.  THAT turned all content into a fucking joke overnight.
---
Can I ask how you have moved the questie quest list away from the edge of the screen? Mine is currently sitting on top of my 2 right action bars
---
I need this too if anyone comments
---
God damn... any gold tips bro
---
Nice. 
---
Wanna make it even lazier?
---
Use console port do you can play with a Controller. 
---
Needs some time to get used to, sure but you can play laid back.
---
Blizzards shit tier CS at it again, it seems
---
Aaand the Horde is on a different layer....
---
That's predicated on MC gear actually outweighing the pre raid bis, which isn't always the case.  You split your resto shamans for example by trying to build full sets.  So whoever is not ahead on their full set isn't going to get a lot of gear.  They'll be competing with all other healers for common gera.  Things like Sash of Mercy for example are still going to be miles ahead as bis going into BWL for any shaman not using 8 piece tier 1.  The caveat is those same shamans will be using that 8 piece tier 1 until nax, but it defines their healing role.  The non 8 piece shaman is only going to stack +heal, no matter where it comes from.
---
Also, we have a pretty good idea of what we need to farm to prepare for later phases, so you can always do that.
---
People who are serious about raiding do.  People who want to run fast buy a mount
---
&gt;	if it's red is dead
---
Oh so you attack all hordes, even the one's same level or higher than you, even if you're alone?
---
It‚Äôs an American thing because of our president. He tries to send people back to ‚Äútheir country‚Äù even though they were born in the United States. SAD!
---
&gt;Obviously I don't need pre raid bis but what else are we supposed to do on non raiding days?
---
Ask that the people that claim WoW has a ton of endgame.
---
Hit 5.1k as a warlock with imp.  I suffered on dps slightly, but I had played since the beginning and as such was a very bitter warlock.  Blizz didn't tune dot damage for what seemed like forever, so the only way to win was to outlast. 
---
Lots of stam stacking, tanked twin emps like that.
---
I almost thought you were serious for a minute, since I wrote that 20 hours ago.  I'm sure they always happen to need the same remaining members though whenever I happen to be reading lfg :D

Warrior with a pocket pally is virtually unstoppable. I duo leveled my warrior with a ret/holy pally back in the day and we were able to handle most group quests. The gear competition isn't so bad if you're gonna be focused on heals.
---
Also all the points the previous poster made about PvP are correct.

P2 is honor system, Azuregos/Kazzak and Diremaul.

All of the people he duelled were fucking terrible. Half were keyboard turners

I covet your lazy life!
---
Nah, do sm runs for a bit then start doing zones that are green/borderline gray. You'll never really butt up to orange quests and the yellow ones you do find wont be bad. Dinged 60 on green/yellow quests barely starting wpl
---
hmm, i didnt really grind the sm's i guess.
---
12 hours straight arena, anger, golem 0 trinket drops on anger and golem 1 savage chest drop on like 3rd to last run.
---
They CAN kill you.. but probably at a cost.  Wonder how easy it is to escape as a druid though.  That net and  guard spam is real.
---
How often is that the norm though.
---
In classic? Mages. Their toolkit is just really handy in all situations. Two mages can duo a surprisingly large amount of content, AoE pulls can be fun to mix into your questing and once people start doing organised PvP, mages are very strong there. 
---
In general over WoW‚Äôs many expansions? Probably Druid. Versatile, shapeshifting is really fun, at times feral has been really good in PvP and when it‚Äôs not, resto usually is. Access to stealth etc. The only reason they‚Äôre not also my favourite in classic is feral‚Äôs damage is absolutely dreadful meaning you‚Äôre just a nuisance in PvP and getting raid spots as dps is very challenging.
---
I love this üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Same here... I still smoke occasionally, but since baby arrived we instituted a non-smoking policy in the house. That being said, I'm way more 'productive' this time around versus getting baked and forgetting what I was doing/getting distracted every 5 minutes. In Vanilla my buddies called me AFK Koopatuple because I'd step out to smoke, decide I needed some munchies for gaming, go get the snacks, and then forget I was playing until sometime later when I'd get an annoyed text from one of my buddies asking where the fuck I went... Ahh, simpler times.
---
Tip. Don‚Äôt do raids with pugs. Always problems.
---
it resets the cast time, it doesnt add to it.

Yes I killed X number of centaurs.  Totally truthful over here.

At 2 in the morning with no tanks online in chat channels
---
I've been having lots of fun playing WC as an enhancement shaman because I can actually tank, heal, or DPS and pull each role off with only having to change gear around.
---
I understand I should be able to heal with minimal/no talent investment up through the levelling experience as long as I maintain good gear for it, and that shaman tanks aren't really a thing once things get tough. But do you guys think I'd be able to tank even the next set of dungeons like Shadowfang Keep if I keep up good gear for it? (without requiring an overlevelled healer)
---
I love this style of editing, keep them coming !

---
I am 60 like many others no doubt. I was first among my irl friends to reach 60. - Others are 54, 47, 46 and 31. 
---
They asked much the same question as you did.
---
I have spent a while researching for my own enjoyment. I bring you sad news I'm afraid...
---
The slowest leveling bracket is 40-50. From beyond 40 the experience required starts getting higher and higher by a lot compared to the 30-40. But from from 30+ your character starts taking form, and over the course of the 30-40 You start to become bonded to your character, but it is only forged after 40. Yet even then it might still bend a bit.. 
---
Reason being that 40-50 Is worse than 50-60 Is because in the last bracket you start looking into other things than just leveling. Because you need your pre-bis raid gear or gear that at least won't be replaced for a long while, while you are 60. You have to loom into dungeon loot, and find and complete specific Quests both for gear and attunement. Sure you can be one of those people saying.. Well my pre-bis MH drops from Rend in UBRS so I don't have to do that yet. And that's where you are wrong... You naturally want things before 60 as well.. if you are a rogue for instance you would want to get Thrash Blade before 60. 
---
All of your gear slots requires this minor research and tinkering, which I love to do... So you will be busy in those levels.
---
But 30-40 bracket is not hard, if you know where to go. I can only help you with horde side. 28+ You return to Tarren Mill to finish the last quests. 30+ Arathi Highlands. 32+ You do Shimmering Flats, once done you do Desolace until 35. 35+ You move to STV, not before. Also check if you finished Alterac Mountains quests before they go grey. Remember to do pre instance quests, such as "Test of x" starting in Thousand Needles even if it's grey. Ends up in Scarlet Monastery. I naturally advice you to do all dungeon quests as you go. And do all dungeon along the way at least once. About 38+ Swamp of Sorrows? If I recall.. But STV along the way, spiced up with Desolace filler.
---
Looks a ton like my original setup! Nice :)
---
I wish I could ignore entire accounts to get rid of gold begging vermins.
---
No. I‚Äôm saying not everyone takes a ‚Äújoke‚Äù the same way.
---
And rogues do it from behind!
---
The whole point was the sound playing in the background. And who are you to tell anyone how long anyones content "needs" to be.
---
No they really have ZERO leverage, because they are not special snowflakes.  The fact people are relying on PuG's at 60 shows they have not made ANY effort to build any relationships.  By 60 I had about 5 tanks and a dozen healers on my friends list and that is OUTSIDE of my guild.  I have done a total of TWO pugs in the last two weeks and both have been full of morons.  Why would I join a PuG, with people reserving loot, when they are so desperate for players they rely on LFG chanel?
---
Ended up doing Razorfen Kraul, Graveyard and Library this morning in one run and ended up with nearly depleted ammo on my hunter. After a wipe right before Arcanist Doan we had to redo a lot of trash where I would melee and just finish off fleeing enemies with my gun. God I had a blast and even though it is technically not needed having melee and this big variety of skills on my hunter again is something really beautiful. I wish for Blizzard to expand on all these things that are typical for Classic and I can only dream for Classic Plus! :)
---
Unrelated but you don't say an when it precedes a vowel you say it when it precedes a vowel sound.  Unless you're saying "an oooeee" for ui then you should use a.

wouldnt call it op
---
they dont scale as well as Warriors and Mages lategame imo
---
and they damage is very weak aoe
---
they are also kinda mediocre for big pvp

Only if you really, really like another faction's mount and dislike your own.

I am usually Nelf so tigers are perfect for me anyways.

You also need at least the Interface folder, since Interface/Addons is the folder where all the installed addons are located

Also if you copy the whole WTF folder this will also copy system settings like screen resolution etc.

But you can copy the WTF/Interface/ACCOUNTNAME/ folder to only copy key binds and addon settings.

As a heavy Reddit user and a completely new WoW player I disagree. Thanks to the OP for educating me :)

the latest on my realm is "flask recipe reserved for guild", well my answer is get a guild big enough to fill a 5 man.

I tried BFA a month into release. Got my Warrior to level 111 and quit because I found it tedious to play and couldn‚Äôt be bothered to switch to one of my other chars or even use the boost on my less played Alliance characters. I gave it another shot the other day but lost interest before I could fully spec my character. I was already too into Classic by then to give it a fair chance. I may give it another go if I lose interest in classic, which I don‚Äôt see happening for quite a while judging by my past in this game since Vanilla and trying every single expansion so far.

Ahh hardcover mousepad. A man of culture, Not one of these cloth mat savages

Then he‚Äôs probably in STV so he will just stay dead
---
Don't those go off if you go oom? I don't remember really.
---
Might have been true in vanilla. Isnt true now. Deadwind pass is a known farming spot for both sides.

Paladins are the best PvP healers, prot and ret are meme specs. 
---
Priests can go shadow and melt faces
---
if you are level 40 and still dying then it's on you, not the class. Warriors have a slow start but they destroy mobs on higher levels once they have most of their skills and a decent weapon.
---
*slapping intensifies*
---
Keep in mind, I only Shaman tanked a few times waaaaaay back in the day. But ultimately, I used Rockbiter Weapon max rank, and used rank 1 earth shock. Max rank Earth Shock if someone pulls aggro.
---
Another disclaimer: the few times I tanked were guild runs of dungeons we were overgeared for. I imagine progressing through content as Shaman Tank would be very difficult.
---
What addon are you using to see the party members like that, looks solid
---
Hold ctrl
---
Lmao
---
I'd unironically pay 10g to save me that annoying ass trip.
---
"He insulted me and this is wrong. I insulted him and he's just being sensitive."
---
I love my warrior.
---
People say it's brutal, and punishing. And maybe they're right.
---
But there's something intensely satisfying about chaining pull after pull, charging from one fight to the next, stop only for a second to slap a bandage on your wounds now and again.
---
There's something about, every now and then, flexing hard and ripping through a pack of six mobs like a hot knife through butter, or dancing around a hamstrung target who can't so much as hit you. Or giving the healer a /pat and saying no, you won't be using a shield. There's no need for that.
---
Why would you see the rep and skills of a person you are inspecting?
---
RemindMe! 6 hours
---
Its one and the same
---
I honestly dont really care about getting him banned.  
---
A ban or w/e the punishment is isnt going to teach someone decent character - not that my character was the 100% appropriate response either, but ya thats all.   
---
Was just curious of others thoughts and you all provided so thank you. Enjoy the game and just ignore toxic people instead of trying to figure out why they are acting the way they are.
---
Most 60s with epic mounts I know have 12+ days played. Since the game has only been out 31 days, this would average over 9 hours per day played, every day.

Take my kids and my job, i want your life :)
---
you can probably tank easily all dungeons as a shaman until level 40+ where it start to be harder and harder
---
It's called story telling. You have a set-up first, then a build-up and end it with the pay-off.
---
I routinely make melee cleave pugs that pull 40-50k so per hour using ravagers.
---
the level of gold earned skyrocket after level 40.
---
If you're in the UK (or nearby depending on postage costs) I have one I don't use and would be happy to send you for free if your friend would like it?
---
now this is a good setup for a tendie lover!
---
Or took a 2 week staycation and managed to get 60 and an epic mount in that time and been cruising since then.  I just reflected last night if I hadnt taken 2 weeks off I would probably be somewhere in the low 40s still because of how life goes.
---
&gt;I know that blizz likes their money, hence why multiboxing is allowed, but at least multiboxers level all of their accounts themselves. 
---
Disagree on this. A multiboxer levels one character. The others are leveled by a third party software.
---
It looks like it's legit just the top of a shelf. They sell a variety of lap desks that can serve the same purpose. Any flat/raised surface object will do the same thing.
---
Just get a tank pet, loads of spirit gear and cast only mend pet. Easy.
---
I do it simply so they can‚Äôt steal the mob 
---
It‚Äôs just about efficiency not decency
---
It was going so well until I noticed the Nintendo Switch
---
Lmao. I kept telling people i had to go sry in my ST run tonight and id make up reasons why i had to get off. That was funny but i almost wiped us on an Authentic Leeroy Jenkins play. That was scary.. and funny.. to me only i think
---
Same thing dude.
---
Even years ago the ones in Austin were making at least double min wage.
---
as far as i can tell, paladins are better endgame healers, but druids can at least offtank in raids so they get a wee bit more versatility
---
Yes plenty of times
---
My favorite bread and butter macro for people new to the class is this:
---
Just a nice, simple macro that keeps your bars from getting cluttered and simplifys things a bit. Of course you'll also want a macro for swapping weapons, but generally I don't like to macro my weapon swap to my stances as there are many times I might want to go into defensive stance without equipping a shield or what have you. Another good one is a disarm macro. A big one for me is also just macroing all of my basic rotational abilities with /startattack. Too often I found myself getting attacked enemies and having to right click them because my character was just standing there like an idiot.
---
Generally though it's also important to not overdo it. Macros are certainly helpful but they can also limit your flexibility or needlessly complicate things at times.
---
&gt; teach someone
---
Its not about teaching its about the tears. Honestly he seems like the type of guy who would go until banned. Then buy another account to keep on harassing you. Its not your job to teach others how to be decent.
---
I am wanting to build up my macroes also. But I have not found the energy to do it yet. Early level 30 so I am finding a more and more need for it. 
---
I might just go my normal mouse macro way and do it all outside of blizzard macro system.
---
I usually use Zygor but I've been rather disappointed with their Classic guides. Right now I'm using Guidelime with Bustea's 1-60 Horde guide (I've heard Sage's 1-60 guide is good for Alliance) and it seems pretty good.
---
I would be suspect from the beginning if a UBRS run was set to ML. I would probably go as far as to stop tanking in the middle of a boss if I see they switch it. I have a feeling we are going to see a lot of this as the zerg starts to hit 60
---
These guys fuck and lvl. Separately hopefully, focus one at a time
---
You would probably get reported for grieving. GMs and the players are not the same as 15 years ago.
---
They are snowflakes now. /spit ing on someone could trigger them and have you suspended.
---
Fear everything and use blood fury when ur low hp
---
Classic threat meter, but it only shows you other party members that have it installed due to a limitation of the client
---
Seriously, I don‚Äôt give a rats ass about any of this. I‚Äôm sorry that you typed out that very well formatted response to my comment. I literally meant that it‚Äôs a pointless argument. 
---
I‚Äôm not biased towards either faction in the least
---
That's funny, this is exactly where my info comes from.
---
Maybe *you* should read it?
---
why do warriors need to change from 1h/shiled to 2h? even as an arms warrior?
---
It feels different bc it is 
---
The games focus and target group is different 
---
Not a special discovery or anything
---
the dps meter is too small, I can still see part of the fight
---
Depending on what you're doing pve wise, maybe not, but it's easy to throw on a sword and board and off tank, or clutch taunt to save a wipe. In pvp sword and board is useful. Getting focused by two melee while your healer is CC'd? Throw on a shield go D and block those nerds. Gives you another interrupt since you can pummel and shield bash. While leveling it gives you the ability to tank whenever. I've been leveling as arms and aoe tanking dungeons with a 2h this time around just fine though. I will still switch to a shield if it's a huge pull and I'm getting hit hard. Let the healer stabilize the go back to 2h.
---
Lmao. Just have fun and learn bro. Server?
---
The cast time gets knocked back but this should rarely happen. You have your targets permanently slowed/rooted and even if you‚Äôre in a small space where kiting is tricky, you have ice barrier which prevents knockback until it breaks.
---
Damn homeboy second from the right is pretty cute
---
I'd go epic mount before pre raid BiS. There is groups that that demand pre BiS so don't waste money on it
---
Don‚Äôt waste money
---
Out of curiousity I tested it. I was in Dustwallow Marsh. "/who Dustwallow" shows me there are 32 people in Dustwallow Marsh. Dustwallow general chat, which is chat 1, if I do "/chatinfo 1" it shows me there are 61 people in the Dustwallow general chat. 
---
My take from this is, that the general chat is NOT layered, though the /who -command is layered. Unless for some reason /chatinfo will show the people from all the layers. Idk, I could be wrong but it definitely seems to be this way.
---
You realize blizzard makes money with every token? Tokens cost 20‚Ç¨ in europe but if you convert one to bnet balance you only get 13‚Ç¨. Thatd 7‚Ç¨ blizzard maked with every token. Tokens arent created out of thin air. You cant magically convert a token to gold. It only gets converted when someone buys the token. Everytime someone converts a token to gold, someone else just spent 20‚Ç¨ on battlenet.
---
Sounds like you have no life
---
Yeah it's hard to say. I could easily see it achievable by some bug. Prob just a flip of the switch for all the extra content.
---
one to keep one to sell!
---
Looks like he did some keyboard turning himself. Not to mention he facetanked more than he had to and didn't really know how to play his class effectively. I'm not sure how it holds up to 2005 standards, but this is a video that has aged terribly.
---
Sweet! Do you remember where you got it? I couldn‚Äôt find it on curseforge or Twitch
---
Oh god why do I know exactly what gif you mean...
---
You should invite people but it's not worth starting a fight over if someone doesn't. Waiting for named mobs can be quite an xp loss btw. I've seen spots where multiple groups would wait for a mob for 10 minutes. I can grind more than double of the quest xp in that time. Granted it's not very satisfying to abandon a quest but in some situations it just isn't worth it.
---
Having a ‚Äúlife‚Äù is generally considered to be having an active social life and doing new experiences e.g new places or activities.
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the term, if someone chooses to spend all their time working then polishing bowling balls or playing video games all day they do have no life.
---
Whats the level time for those guides? Seems interesting.
---
Then lead your own raid invite who ever you want.
---
Stop telling others how to lead THEIR raids when making a raid group is easy a free
---
Far right looks like he consumes nothing but the flesh of his victims.
---
oh, you only need 1h/shield if you need to tank in pvp? to stay on someone attacking your heals? any other reasons?
---
Yeah, definitely plays undead
---
Yeah Zygors seems a little slow in my opinion, a lot slower than AAP at any rate. How is Guidelime compared to those two?
---
According to Staysafes YouTube guide, you want to skip doing rotgrip and only do the goblin + princess.
---
i started in bc, but i remember shamans being ABLE to tank. theyre very off-meta, but not impossible
---
I have no idea personally (my highest is 33 and I'm an incurable altoholic) but the addon page for Bustea's has a thing that claims 7 days 15 hours with a lot of time spent AFK and on the AH.
---
Yes my man
---
Ninja looters!! Rot in hell!!
---
&gt;why do warriors need to change from 1h/shiled to 2h? even as an arms warrior?
---
It just adds a little bit of utility to a class devoid of it for the most part. What I mean by this is you have the option to gain a bit of damage reduction and block chance when shit isn't going your way. Also shield bash can be useful if you want to interrupt something but pummel is on CD. Also shield wall requires a shield and is a 75% damage reduction on the same 30 min cd as reck and retaliation, it's the ultimate "oh shit" ability and can come in clutch.
---
There‚Äôs a very small market for faction specific items that can be traded. Can‚Äôt think of anything off the top of my head but I doubt they give much of a profit. 
---
RP servers probably have a better market for this stuff.
---
As a priest som of my heals tend to occasionally pull adds that havent had much threat built on them.
---
I hit fade and run to the tank until it's off me.
---
Yup, and the raptor from Zul'Gurub.
---
Game is hard when you are under leveled/under geared and game is easy when you have the gear/levels fo the content you are doing.
---
I've skipped it on all characters so far on classic.  Fuck that dungeon, not going there unless I play something that badly needs an item.
---
I think the classes are simply better, more skill/ability. My biggest problem with retail especially with bfa is the classes lost their uniqueness if you play a frost dk that almost like a fury warrolior or combat rog etc they removed the weapon options from shamans dks warriors which is another big minus too. Tldr there is not enough options in retail.
---
I actually fell for that yesterday, and after that run I started whispering those LFM asking if they had a confirmed Jed spawn. One didn't reply to 3 whispers and the other 2 hadn't even scouted...
---
&gt;What do you do to ensure you have your epic mount when you ding 60? 
---
Loot a Warden Staff or Edgemaster's ^/s
---
Learn to read dude.
---
Luna unit frames is another fantastic one. Takes a bit of learning to set it up right but it‚Äôs great.
---
I wanna do something like this too because sitting on a chair for too long gives me back pain.
---
not on a pvp server, that shit is dangerous to do in the wild.
---
Where can, say a friend, buy that table top? For a friend ofcourse
---
Bite is not a focus dump in Classic. It has a 10 sec cooldown.
---
You are not wrong, and it's kinda funny to see how many people don't believe you. I just tried it with a friend to confirm.

Agreed, I would suggest he stands in the lava in searing gorge.

---
I don't know who you are. I don't care what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have any gold, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career of playing as a warrior. Skills that make me a nightmare for alliance like you. If you let me have that setup now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will take your nuggets.
---
What is the best database with the most accurate information strictly for classic? 
---
Im sick of looking at 9 different sites.
---
Thank you! this solved it! have a nice day, sir!
---
Life goal achieved.  Well played.
---
The stance mechanic can be daunting at first, but remember you won't even get berzerker stance until level 30, so it's all introduced slowly. And aside from the effects inherent to the stance itself you really aren't swapping stances all that often. A regular encounter usually begins with you charging, casting sweeping strikes if it's more than one mob, then just swapping to berzerker stance for the rest of the fight and only swapping back to battle stance if the enemy dodges. In regular open world levelling you won't be using defensive stance unless it's an emergency or PvP. It's daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it it'll become second nature. If you're feeling overwhelmed though maybe work on getting a solid feel for the class first before diving into macros (besides the basic stance swapping macros) because that can add an unnecessary level of complexity.
---
If you havent hit 40, I suggest you aim for that or atleast 39 and then just start farming. No reason to spend that much time in low value stuff.
---
when you need the money got 500g and glove gose for 500g sell it to get the epic mount.
---
the oppertunity gains by the epic mount is huge so getting it is a key thing but selling the golves before you actually have the rest of the money is a big mistakes as prices are bound to only go up and you might end up spending the money on other things.
---
Or they're fury and wondering why the 53 arms warrior is out dpsing them.
---
What? No he is right, tauren can only ride kodo and wolfs. The exception to the rule is the zg raptor and rivendares horse.
---
Can you theoretically never buy any riding skill and just win the roll for Riverdare‚Äôs mount? Or do you need riding skill of some sort?
---
how often am i switching stances in pvp?
---
As a horde on Skeram just leave bro. Horde are edgy gankers just get out if you still can or me and 10 people are gonna gank you while questing on a mob for eternity
---
The nice thing about Classic is that each server has, or will have, a community. You'll eventually tun into the same people over and over.
---
Reputation can go a long way. Fucking it up by being a ninja looter or douche otherwise might just come back to haunt whoever pulled that shit.
---
I need to freshen up my macros but atm my most used Macro is an overpower macro that switches me to battle stance first, it's just a shame it doesnt flash or light up when Overpower is available so I have to watch for dodges manually.
---
I've also got ones for mouse over taunt, mouse over sunder, rend + start attack, emergency defense protocols (switch to def, equip sword n board, disarm, shield wall), fear stop attack and bandage, swap and mocking blow, challenging shout announcement (Big taunt dont let me die!).
---
Macros I'd love to get but dont think they work...
---
&gt;If out of combat, switch to battle and charge and auto, if in combat switch to zerker and intercept and auto
---
&gt;If sword n board, shield bash, if 2h switch to zerker and pummel
---
Well... you're right. I completely missed that the normalization only affects AP, not weapon damage. My bad.
---
How fast is AAP?
---
If Blizzard support is anything like Activision support the folks on the phone won't even discuss bans with you. so good luck with that plan.
---
Niiiiice
---
When I posted my gnome on a saber last week I got downvoted through the floor. This sub is weird sometimes.
---
Camp around BRD/UBRS. Thats what i did back in vanilla.
---
Both are bad
---
I wanna play MGS so bad right NOW! Where that Psycho Mantis hiding?!
---
Well i believe you .. people go nuts over everything these days.
---
I completely agree with you, it's like crushing children in games - You know you'll win, they know you'll win, it's just a total waste of time on both sides. 
---
At least try to find a semblance of a challenge, all of this one sided ganking is the equivalent of crushing beginner bots in competitive games to me.
---
&gt;Why would I lie about my situation
---
because literally everyone who has ever cheated on any game ever lies about it when contacting customer support or posting about it online.
---
Germans do this a lot as well. That and the ^^ stuff have almost exclusively been a german thing in my experience.
---
Do you have the names of any addons that tell you energy/mana ticks?
---
I don't think I've ever seen such an addon before.
---
Not the majority actually, rather a noticeable minority. Well, until phase 2 that is: I know I will start ganking green-leveled guys left and right once that drops, I really want to at least try getting to rank 11. Not 14, that one is beyond my grasp, but rank 11 is probably doable, I hope so at least.
---
Which DPS meter you use?
---
I see Razor Anansi, i upvote.
---
kudos to you for telling youre wrong, seriously. most people on here would just ignore it / insult others before acknowledging their mistakes.
---
What trinket?
---
***HE GOT WEED HE GOT WEED!***
---
He should also be one of the most powerful characters in the game but for blizzard probably forgetting about him.
---
They probably have records of conversations with the other GM, a new GM will probably not deviate from the first GM's response
---
Playing a mage is the laziest thing here
---
Shankngank
---
I MT'd ZG/Aq20/mc/bwl for a fee every week. I has absolutely 100% zero use for the gear from any of it. I would even go into a channel with any other warrior in the group and teach them how to do it while they were given EVERY single piece of tank gear that I obviously did not need. 
---
It's also how I got my second binding. I told a guild that I would tank MC for them on the condition I can buy the binding if it dropped and I would wave my fee completely. They had no other person that would complete with that binding so they agreed. It dropped, I traded them 2500g and owned my legendary sword.
---
speaking of, I really like the new album that came out a few weeks ago
---
Alot more often since PvP is less predictable and therefore benefits more from the base benefits of the stances such as the 10% dmg reduction from defensive stance. But honestly Id say probably around 75% of your abilities can be used in all three stances, and maybe an additional 5% can be used in two out of the three
---
[Wowhead](http://www.classic.wowhead.com)

if you do want an idea

get 58 normally

then grind your way to 60 on any valuable mobs 
---
such as elementals for the essences and whatever else
---
Relax buddy, 2 are my irl friends 1 added me and the other didnt talk the whole time and we cleared at a very good first run pace with no deaths. Try to have fun, its not all rotations and gear

I don‚Äôt know. Go over to r/buildapc and ask. They have a daily thread for asking questions.
---
If I‚Äôm playing with 4 other people in a group: warri tank, heal shaman, shadow priest and a mage; we‚Äòre doing mostly instances, what is my ideal spec and general gameplay idea?
---
Yep, if I am adjacent to a dungeon near my level, I get whispers asking to tank even if I don't say anything. I had people trying to get me to tank scholo and strat before max level even.
---
I eventually spend &gt;1000g on my lvl 1 bank alt(s). No joke. 3 dragonlings, posh gear, enchants, it adds up quickly.  This is long term though.
---
I'm surprised there aren't enough quests to hit 60 with
---
Ok, because I was supposed to know all that from your first post...
---
You've been playing with some bad locks. If someone is being that inconsiderate to the healer (and the whole group, this slows the dungeon down because you need to drink more often) then fuck 'em.
---
I use ShowMeMyHeal, got it off twitch mods
---
It's annoying if you're playing a mage and the tank stops every time you start drinking.
---
I'll be spamming drink between every single pull, don't wait for me, I don't need to start every pull with full mana bar, and I got many mana cooldowns I can use if I run low on mana.
---
My philosophy is that every second spent with a full mana bar is time wasted for the party.
---
I agree. I see the game like a hobby. If you want and can put so much time into it, more power to you
---
I have a macro profile on my mouse so I can heal with mouse keys from outside while having a smoke xD
---
dr phil, steve wilkos, gordon ramsay compilations
---
It is hard when you are combat speced, but the tactic that worked best for me would be to wait until they lifetap to about half hp or have some mobs on them. After that you just stunlock and eviscarate. I always kick fear or racial it because this is why undead is a master race. 
---
If you are really clutch you must vanish their coils and use engineering to bomb stun em chicken pet them to death.
---
yah, back in vanilla I did 1/4 up front for at minimum my repairs or any potential items I might use up 3/4 on finish. Today I just record it, chat visible. If they stiff me ever, prepare to see some massive asshole posting on forums and reddit with video proof of the converstion, the run being complete, and the nonpayment.
---
If its a mini boss with slower spawn people usually group.
---
youre going to end up blacklisted just cause youre obviously a huge douchebag
---
Can you explain to me how to do this scouting g via mind vision?
---
Looks like he has a favourite word
---
What, i feel the opposite this has been the best bracket so for for me. There is so much to do. Hillsbrad, stranglethorn desolace or thousand needles all have a lot of quests, then meanwhile I still want some gear from SM so I'm running that too. I feel like I barely have to time to do everything before I'm 40!
---
!remind me 7 days

---
Don‚Äôt worry about any pre-BiS gear until lvl 52 and start doing BRD. Do a few Prison/Arena runs for xp and some gear. 
---
Don‚Äôt get sucked into the Arena/Angerforge runs. You really want the boss after Angerforge, Golem Lord, that many groups will also go to for you and casters. He drops the trinket Second Wind and Omnicast Boots. Those are probably your two earliest pre-BiS goals as a priest.
---
You could also stretch for Vault runs at an early level. You need 12 relic coffee keys and has a chance to drop Hammer of Grace which you absolutely want. But the boss is very difficult for a lower lvl group
---
Fair enough. My bad. I didn't look at stats but rather damage meters of a few rogues.
---
Sometimes I've been paid even when I could use something from it. I had a guild ask me to bring my warrior to Naxx with them that week for horsemen. My guild had enough tanks to cover it and I had an alt geared enough to do naxx in another role. I took payment because it was a large imposition on me to add another night to my raid schedule to help them do 4h.
---
gold skyrocket after level 35. And even before.
---
I never had more than one/two gold during level 20-30, now i'm level 32 and i have 10 golds.
---
You're calculating CoA as if it's straight line DPS, and it isn't. The damage ramps up, with most of it in the last few tics. If your mob isn't living long enough for CoA to get to the meat of its damage, immolate works better because it's front-loaded.
---
Hot damn
---
Is formula: enchant gloves - riding skill any good?  I just got one from fishing in a wreckage via a mithril bound box.  There isnt one listed on AH anywhere to gauge a value.  I am an enchanter, not quite yet at the 250 skill required to learn it.  should I keep this or sell it?  am on a PVP server.
---
Bigglesworth alliance has a guy that will summon you to darnassus. Used to be 50s last time i saw him advertising for 1g. Damn economy shooting up the prices
---
15g?! Thirsty rogue bois pay 30g easily, since warriors don't want to take them on Mara princess runs (who knows why ;)
---
Krakmoth approves.

It might help to mark one mob with a skull, if you lose agro on it then thats fine because it should die super quick. This gives you time to build agro on any other mobs.

My big money maker was LBRS 5 man tanking.
---
See you on a PvE server! No shame, I‚Äôm on one now.
---
Looks like recount but its garbage. Details is by far the best one nowadays.
---
tanking is very doable until Lbrs imo. after that dungeons require a good amount of cc and downtime
---
Thank you!
---
reminder that classic wow is hard - there's a lot of quests that you'll need at least a partner with. def ask in the general channels to see if anyone is looking for a questing buddy!
---
Better against mages, arguably worse against other rogues. For pvp I'd vote gnome, though for pve human is the obvious better choice.
---
Marijuana kills your brain and turns you undead. Serve the light, say no to drugs.

---
The macros you want can work.  The conditions are [combat], [nocombat], [equipped:shield], [noequipped:shield]. Equipped worked with other gear pieces too. You‚Äôd have to look up what they are named if you wanted other conditions. 
---
Marry those into a macro how you want and you can create those.
---
you mean they all abused the raid xp bug to hit 60 quickly and layering to get 1k gold.
---
This actually makes me really disappointed of myself in this game as I've been playing every day since launch and I have 14 days /played and am lvl 55 with 200g. :(
---
Pretty common in dota 2, ive used it numerous times since you have to be quick in that game. And no I'm not Russian :)
---
You want some real funny shit? 'LFM tank for BRD arena runs, epic chest on reserve'
---
I see that every fucking day in lfg.
---
Well blizzard took too long to announce the br realm and ppl dont have incentives to transfer rn.
---
horde players lmao
---
Really? Want to know how many many spriests, non-resto druids, non-resto shamans and other unoptimal specs we brought in my guild when we raided in vanilla?
---
Nothing about any of this is new at all. I'm seeing way more non-cookie cutter specs in classic than I ever did in vanilla, and I also see a lot more people complaining about "meta" or "spellcleave" or whatever, it's so incredibly annoying, and I have a feeling it's mainly from people who didn't play vanilla, or at least were very young when vanilla was a thing.
---
I am very much so since I pointed out your misunderstanding. It‚Äôs your misunderstanding what Op said that doesn‚Äôt add anything to the discussion.
---
Have a good day yourself!
---
I like to wvpvp in ferales where people farm felcloth for bis
---
Not if you are horde. Oh well , I mean then you are part of the carnage you unleash upon those poor allies that walk in
---
I think the EU servers are a lot less populated that the US ones.
---
I don't think i've seen the EU ones all high/full since i started playing 2 weeks ago
---
I use details, but i find the threat meter it has to be trash. Is there any options for different addon?
---
These warriors must be buying a bunch of skills they don't need, buying from AH, or working on professions pretty hard. Made it to 40 with enough gold for a mount, and now sitting at 250ish gold ATM at level 52. None of that was made from blue or purple boe drops, just from questing and dungeon runs and selling grey junk to vendors, and occasional vendoring or AHing green drops. I also always tank dungeons so I have to pay for repair bills more than I would if I ran them as dps. Warriors are lucky that we don't need a lot of our skills past rank 1, other classes don't get the luxury of weapon damage dictating most of their damage.
---
That profit!!

---
For the hoard!
---
ur on the wrong sub, this place is full of the most pathetic casuals u will ever meet
---
What's with all these people making gnomes?
---
I dont play wow but hearing about a quest like this from the sidelines really makes it sound like a cool af quest, it'd feel like such an achievement completing it with all the bullshit that can cause a fail.
---
Smart.  Well hope you get back on your feet.
---
Hydrated Waterlads.
---
&gt; That the sane logic can be applied the other way around  
---
That was my point.
---
It's less about what guide you use and more about good tactics. Focus on killing mobs in a good rhythm and shaving off those extra seconds each fight. The top questing levelers still grind mobs from point a to point b.
---
Want to know what's funny? I didn't push my guild when I hit 60 first in it. I just went 'hey guys, I'm pug'ing raids this week so won't be available to help'. 
---
That's it. I just pugged MC and Ony without hesitation. Who cares? they're super easy raids rofl.
---
He forces the others to only wear greens and be poorly optimized.  He has taken all the loot for himself to become a mediocre dps GOD.
---
I haven't had sex ever. :(
---
Had around 1800 people I think yesterday.
---
How are you not ashamed of showing us your UI? I'd kill myself if I were so bad.
---
I stopped leveling heroic strike because I just sunder everything to max stacks and autoattack/rank1overpower them to death.
---
That doesn‚Äôt prove anything.
---
I agree. 
---
‚ÄúYou will work X man hours for us. But you won‚Äôt receive payment‚Äù 
---
It‚Äôs the definition of slavery. You could probably file a complaint in the EU and hope loot reserves criminally responsible.
---
If you want to reserve loot, take responsibility and form your own group, but don‚Äôt invite any class that could roll on it. It takes time and effort, but you don‚Äôt use anybody‚Äôs time and effort without compensation.
---
It's because he knows how to use the print screen button.
---
Jokes aside, congrats that's very impressive.
---
There are multiple scepters, no need to be rude.
---
&gt;  If you are a rogue u can pick pocket farm brd.
---
tho u wont get xp during it and u need stealth talents
---
'quest' aka talk to your lock buddy in ratchet and click twice.
---
Broken as fuck I love this
---
More than 5 hours every day. To have an epic mount already and farmed 10k runecloth (or the gold to buy it) you‚Äôll need to have either abused the exploits at launch or played 8-10 hours a day.
---
I‚Äôve played way more than I should (probably about 3-4 hours a day on average, more on w/e, less midweek) and I‚Äôm only lvl 53 with 200g. I‚Äôve also been told by my guild I won‚Äôt be able to get a raid spot at 60 because there are already too many lvl 60s. 
---
There‚Äôs a lot of people hardcoring classic and I fear for the PvP patch. It won‚Äôt be like vanilla where most people were in shit gear. There will be a horde of people in full epics on day-1.
---
Why tho
---
In the game it was meant to be funny and same with the comment i made. I don‚Äôt blame you for not laughing bro but this post is just about OP being silly and trolling people so i thought u could relate what i said to that. Sry
---
Are there any online resources that can tell me if an item is worth auctioning? I have Auctioneer addon installed but it tells me to vendor green items sometimes.
---
Oh sweet, I'll try and figure them out then! Thanks! I figure the stance dance charge/intercept one would make stance dance keyboards unnecessary like my overpower one
---
I've done it in vanilla and will do it now. If I need literally only one item in the dungeon and absolutely nothing else I 'just say it straight out. If I have a second warrior in my scholo run and I go 'Hey, I need only X, everything else is yours', most times they're ok with it.
---
900 summons? 450 gold split between all the summoners does not feel that good of a business. Well, if you just have a bunch of lvl20-30 alts logged off at those locations, it's probably an afk farm anyways, so probably good shit.
---
If CoA is a waste then I feel like corruption would just be a better DOT right?
---
Good question, I have no idea.
---
How exactly does it not prove anything?
---
You literally only need the douses to spawn Raggy, no actual consumables are needed nor have we used them in our &lt;1h clears.
---
It's funny now knowing more about the group you were in.
---
Tsst. Be dominant.
---
Tanks become really greedy and arrogant cause they are rare. Dont join and let em search group for hours.
---
What lvl r u? THATS WHAT I THOUGHT! The ONLY reason i dont have sex is more efficient lvling. Either ur in or ur out
---
I dont really see a downside to any of the classes. Yea some are faster or w/e but at the end of the day I dont see WoW as the kind of game you should be optimizing for. Imo you should be playing a class that you identify with.
---
For myself I played a paladin through vanilla -&gt; tbc -&gt; wotlk. In classic I intend on playing a mage. I loved playing a paladin and I identified with the lore, playstyle and being able to fulfill almost any role in dungeons or pvp. 
---
Now that I am quite a bit older and do not really intend on doing heavy pvp or end raids, I will be playing a mage. They seem like fun for adventuring and given how much damage they do I think I could enjoy some wpvp and the odd skirmish here and there.
---
Finally someone else who gets it!
---
Also it's not only converting to balance but regular subs too.
---
A sub paid with token is 20‚Ç¨ instead of 15, and no discounts for multiple months like you can get with real money.
---
He's not wrong. Aqu√§ is a shitty name.
---
That's literally just them going 'hey can you help us with this quest?'
---
Everyone a higher level than you is a no lifer, everyone below you us a scrub.
---
They‚Äôre constantly high/full after 5pm tho during weekdays
---
I hopped on my account , which I quit in early cata, to check out some stuff. Knew I was going to never go back to it when I logged on the troll sham to find ghost wolf is fugly as all hell and I have a head bob like I'm a pigeon. 
---
Doesn't help I felt stripped of everything seeing all of my action bars basically empty. Also my lvl 80 DK seems to be deleted because I couldn't find him anywhere on the servers. Maybe I was missing something.
---
Yeah I figured.
---
Thank you. It was a server first on EU-Everlook at the time, not sure if it still is.
---
MC got reverse nerfed.  The bosses didn't get weaker but the players got significantly stronger through buffs to talents and skill/class reworks.  Also not positive but I really dont remember there being so much +healing, +dmg/healing, spell hit/crit,, etc gear being everywhere.  
---
I know when Dire Maul came out it introduced quite a bit but on my original character I mostly skipped it since we were mostly through MC at that point and I was a hunter.  I think the gear optimization on stats is making raids that were already easy just a snorefest.  Not surprised that classic raids wont even start to be a bit challenging until twin emps and even then still shouldnt be considered "hard".
---
Amusing
---
AAP is fast, but you are always questing with mobs your level +/- 1. It's taken just about verbatim from Joana's, so it's designed for Hunters who are able to quest like that. Zygor keeps you a level or two above the quests.
---
def did this in 2006. i always thought the 'wetlands run' was night elfs coming the other way.
---
This is literally my SO's Cataclysm setip except at least we had the excuse of having jusy moved in to a new place (our first together actually... I feel old now...)
---
If your group is focusing alot on aoe pulls, the stun talent from rain of fire is crazy good combined with a mage. But otherwise it's alot worse then running affliction. And make sure ur healer does not waste mana on you, make use of ur self heals to make the group more efficient. You can still top dps doing thus with careful multi dotting
---
I mean, they are deliberately leaving in known bugs from vanilla, and even went through the trouble of programming in artificial lag to simulate how vanilla felt. It‚Äôs not out of the realm of possibility that they would enforce the vanilla TOS.
---
A great analogy was used at the launch of BFA, comparing Retail WoW to a rollercoaster. It's great fun at first, and there's all sorts of entertainment to be found at arms reach away, but in order to do this, you must keep your hands and legs inside the vehicle at all times. To feed you through this amazing story of theirs, you have to be led down a very specific path and lose any agency to pursue your own journey, follow your own path, and embark on your own adventure.
---
Corruption all the time and CoA if there target will live for a while
---
Vendoring green items in classic, thats how it is. Most people won't buy that item but rather safe their money for the mount.
---
Good point.
---
Inflation is starting on my server as we're reaching 500 lv60 on each side.
---
start watching prices on your 3 boe tier 0 and snap them up when they're cheap.
---
Is your vertical sens higher?
---
Yeah it's the amount of available plugins that has me questioning lol. The Zygor interface is so nice. Guidelime is a litte clumsy, but if it has more optimised routes, I may swap.
---
My druid is 38 and I started launch day. I feel personally attacked.
---
Personally I love trying to find all the mobs myself etc. But I do wish there was a way to see where the questgivers are without the other features of questie
---
Does your brother by any chance know your account information?
---
It makes me super super super sad to see low level warriors get ganked. They ahve it bad enough as it is rofl.
---
After seeing the context, this is hilariously pathetic.
---
Are you a meat popsicle?
---
I don‚Äôt play or watch WOW but this video had me in tears
---
Thx. If i had wiped us that would have been bad but we did it earlier in the dung first time with healer gone as a prank timed perfectly with him coming back from afk. Then we pranked the tank.. he just came back later than it being comfortable
---
A few days after release I saw these in trade, I asked how much... The guy sold them to someone else for 10g.
---
You sound salty
---
It‚Äôs just print screens from your point of view. You could‚Äôve just asked your friend to say they didn‚Äôt see anything even though they did.
---
What‚Äôs your reasoning that this proves anything?
---
I won‚Äôt give up on your Druid!
---
No. Dark pact is not great.
---
Use VoidWalker and some Demo talents for extra survivability and VW upgrades . VW is best with no competition.
---
How do you know?  Ever experienced a Mandela Effect?
---
How rude &lt;3
---
The voidwalker is the worst pet, but it has the bonus of making people scared of fighting you, since sacrifice is such a big hp boost
---
Level 60 Warlocks have two raid specs, SM Ruin and DS Ruin, both are really good for any type of content. While leveling you are probably specced into affliction anyway, which is good. Can't recommend destruction for leveling unless you only do spell cleave
---
After traveling half a world away twice to get the previous two summons I figured I‚Äôd have to do a lot more than click twice üòÇ
---
Pleasant surprise to be sure.
---
TEchnically it's possible to use slam as part of an encounter but lol no you're not gonna.
---
Is ninja looting actually an offence in the eyes of the GMs? Like, if you join a group and it's clearly stated that nothing is reserved and you would roll MS&gt;OS, and someone a) put on master looter at rend for the sword, b) needed on things they don't need. Are the 'victims' actually able to do anything, or its just leave group and chalk it up to bad experience?
---
Personally, I don't join any group with reserved items. And I've had no problems with ninja looting.
---
Enemy dodges - Overpower activated - Overpower misses 
---
Every single fucking time
---
*Engine room, ramming speed!*
---
It feels like they're trying to prepare the ground for it or something. Why now... I have no idea. I mean, it's been alluded to for a *long* time. This punchcard, the whole "she reminds me of Taretha" thing... Then they go, deny everything and make Jaina have a relationship with a dragon and Thrall marry a random NPC before going on extended parental leave (both things narrated mostly in books and comics too, so out of the plot experience of most players).
---
I've been shipping the two for a long time, since it would have had potential for much more interesting story than either of the things they went with. So presently I'm somewhat curious to see where they'll go with it - if they'll go anywhere.
---
The thing is quests are pretty spread out and scarse at 56+, sometimes u get a fail BRD group which can easily take 2 hours of your time. etc And yes on top of that there is alot of wpvp. Lastly not everyone is a super rusher(min/maxer), this isnt a bad time for an average player in the late fifties tbo.
---
After the account name there are multiple folders, one is called saved variables for shared things, and there is a folder per realm and in there another folder for characters. So if you copy the whole wtf/interface/account name all chars on all servers are covered
---
Why? It's not like classic rotations are particularly complicated...
---
Happens to me too. Reported the bug about a week ago.
---
Humans have been in Lorderon since 15k years ago after being exiled by their parents. They don't really seem to match the prototype of an imperialist.
---
That's the problem. "Life" is clearly "good", "no life" is clearly "bad". So how fair is it to say that "life" *means* "active social life"?
---
It's as if those with active social life scream "we are better". Quite a dick move if you ask me.
---
Thralls Balls!
---
That may be the worst video editing and UI I have ever seen..
---
i bought an epic mount with 2 crafting professions. gathering professions are boring.

---
Delicious Cave Mold.. Yummyumm..
---
I want to twink so no
---
There is no proof. Also the raid xp wasn't even seen as a bug, people just optimized their xp/hr within the features of the game. If Blizzard had done more extensive betatesting they could have avoided these issues, it's not the players fault (maybe except instance layering).
---
Showing up to raid with sub par gear because you want to run faster isn't going to be liked by your guild. It's one thing to not have the money at all, it's something else to spend your gold on a mount instead of something that benefits you in raid
---
That is a good fucking price especially if you want a budget Warden staff when you combine this thing with Stiches' Femur or the Totem of Affliction
---
Oh really? Maybe I just grinded between mobs more than necessary, because as of right now I'm still a level and a half ahead of the guide.
---
i distinctly remeber town being attacked during pvp event and general chat being spammed because of it but not being able to see any pvp because of layering. so afaik it works across layers unless something changed recently
---
Give in.... to the.... temptation...
---
But you can (and should) isolate the rolls, that's exactly what gambler's fallacy is all about. It's in human nature to see patterns and give meaning to those patterns. It all depends on your point of view. Once the rolls happened, they happened. You cannot change the outcome of previous rolls, therefore they shouldn't be taken into account for future rolls. 
---
I totally agree with you that statistically it's much harder to roll the same number twice, if you don't know what the first number is you rolled. If you know the first number, the question is no longer "what are the odds of rollng the same number twice in a row", the question becomes "what are the odds of rolling this number".
---
We don't know how Blizzard implemented their random number generator. But we do know that all these algorithm take for input is a seed. That seed should be unpredictable and the smallest change in that seed should provide a different result. Usually a timestamp up to milliseconds is taken as input. 
---
The algorithm should never remember previous outcomes and base decisions on that. Again, we don't know and I will never assume it is. I trust in Blizzard's implementation that it is truly random (from a statistical point of view).
---
For a coin it's much easier to comprehend. A coin does not remember what he flipped before. It's the human that remembers it and puts value to it. The coin does not remember flipping heads 4 times in a row. For the coin the chances on the next toss are still 50/50.
---
Also, you actually want to be doing green quests and mobs so always be a couple levels higher than the area you're in, I dunno the stats but believe green quests actually give you the same XP and yes green mobs give a bit less but resist much less so easy killing = more kills.
---
The guide I'm following for alliance is - https://deathblind.com/alliance-leveling-guide
---
Haha I'm glad I'm not the only one with a lazy setup. I bought a new rig for classic after not having one for 3 years. I have no desk so computer is at the end of the bed, I deliberately made sure cables on all peripherals were long enough to reach me and I use my wife's makeup box to use my mouse on and keyboard on my lap.
---
Secure tha bag!
---
Pretty sure Chain Lightning in pull generates a huge amount of threat, but I could be wrong
---
Is Morrowgrain not in game, or is it more expensive these days?
---
sadly this happens, but as others said you (and your guild if it is full of repeat offenders) will be black listed. I make sure to tip them extra as they are doing us all a great service and they do not make much money on it, for how much time they put in. if anyone else is on grob and uses their service, try to tip a bit on top so they feel compelled to do this as long as possible. The effort they put in is pretty crazy
---
Great service, used them a few times. They are even free. You can donate if you like, but no requirement.
---
I think they earn more this way. I usually throw a gold at them when using them.
---
Pretty sure you can win it without riding skill, just like you can win a 2H axe without the axe skill.
---
Go into your action bar settings and disable and re-enable the right side action bars. The list should shift over.
---
Wait till next or the week after that depending on how much you play. Then you'll realize fast that you ran right into the "log only in for raids" trap.
---
Ash bur Uden lo

---
I, a former altoholic, approve this message. Warlock best class.
---
It's fine up until about 30 then it starts going off the rails. From what I've read on their forums, it seems to be an intentional change because of their "efficiency updates" and people "not liking to travel so much to stay ahead of the curve". I generally kill everything I can on the way to quests but the 31-32 guide was having me kill 35s.
---
11-*what*? How many hours does that take to farm :0
---
hahaha same for lottery
---
Lol I saw this today, Horde Herod
---
Wile E Coyote approves.
---
Aq40 eh? A random group of clowns did it on my server. Raided one night a week, took random as long as they showed up. Skill not required. I'd seen better pugs than the time they asked other guilds if they could borrow a tank for the night.
---
Hey thats my friend! Really cool guy =)
---
Does tier 0 mean BIS? And do you know a good website to find that info?
---
Spoiler warning pls :O
---
I had my mount + 40g extra at lvl 40 as a warrior. When I hit 60 yesterday I had 800g in total. The trick is to have a bank alt that you send everything you get that can be sold on the Ah, and then Aldo spend 5-10 min a day trying to flip stuff, easiest money you will Ever make
---
As someone who played without much of a pause until the latest retail raid was released I can assure you that the endgame in Retail is most certainly not "amazing". I logged in to raid mythic with my guild three times a week and literally the only thing that was interesting about that was trying to get better logs each week. The gear you got was completely pointless as it gets reset every few weeks anyways. Other than that the RBG scene was completely dead for months before the classic release. You literally could not find a group to play with until the evening despite being able to group up with players from every realm. Lastly, arena where your gear does not make a difference at all and every spec feels the same. Keystones might be fun in the beginning but very quickly get boring.
---
I legit spent 90% of my online time in retail collecting shit such as mounts or achievements from past expansions.
---
Want that now! ‚ò∫
---
Lovely. You too, my Lord.
---
FYI, that was more people thinking no one wanted to be that no life to force their entire guild to level for something that was cleared well over a decade ago.
---
Friend of mine does Maura by running by most mobs at lv60. To get Princess down you need to trigger the knock back with your pet so you can kite her around. Though I don't know all the details
---
I'm glad to have been of service
---
I can see your point but honestly it's just so much more beneficial for the whole guild if the MT gets full gear asap rather than giving a piece to each tank.
---
Isn't it to the left?
---
I was at the same position but after level 35 (more or less) you start making a lot more gold just from auctioning stuff you find on your journey
---
Does it work? Has anyone tried it?
---
Nothing is mandatory so you have no right to demand it.
---
But it's common sense to group up for named mobs, also a sign of kindness and respect for other people's time, not a trait everyone has unfortunately.
---
This happen when u aggro mob from middle he then go around picking everything
---
mage? check
---
defending exploits that ruined classic? check
---
youre a real gem
---
Drops from Voone, 14% chance
---
And neither does EPL really, 90% of the quests there are for dungeons
---
This was an extremely polite internet fight.
---
Watching the DPS meter in time with the music was so so so satisfying.
---
Lack of choice I imagine.
---
Is it the subway tunnel looking corridor that's sloping downwards? As in, lowest part in the middle and higher along the sides? If it is, I've wiped there too when trying to go the middle part. I think what happens is that mobs from the sides either aggro or there's an alarm bot up there that you can't see who pulls everything. It went smooth as soon as we stopped going the middle route and picked the left, higher, lane instead.
---
Or maybe they know exactly what OP did wrong and don't feel the need to elaborate, because OP knows exactly what he did wrong as well?
---
There was a post a few days ago about a GM getting back to a rogue who had been unfairly warned in-game to not use roof exploits in Tanaris when he, a melee class, was the one who reported it. The GM apologized profusely for the mistake and gave the player a month of free game time for the "trouble" (getting a warning to his account).
---
I'm of a mind that Blizzard may half-ass things sometimes, but certainly not when reviewed, and this guy's case was reviewed. The fact that this agent won't elaborate, to me doesn't spell incompetence, it shows the agent knows what this guy did and just won't call him out on it out of morality.
---
He didn't "forget to switch accounts", he miswrote him/me in the first sentence and this is apparent by how he speaks for himself, as the OP, in the first person right under it. You're awfully quick to judge, my friend. Almost everything you offered as a "rebuttal" here applies to the person who wanted the elite kill as well.
---
They are extremely useful as an emergency button.
---
I think ‚Äúrequired‚Äù depends on what stage you are at. If you‚Äôre very well geared and simply farming MC bosses in a casual raid you can probably get away without.
---
For progression it‚Äôs probably extremely useful to have 5-8 per raid.
---
I‚Äôd recommend having some spare in your backpack anyway.
---
Maybe farm some gold for your epic mount?
---
I might have to suck it up and forgo the 40 ping for 200 ping on NA :(
---
Dont u get latency delay with HDMI cable?
---
Time to become the wrath of god and smite all enemies within STV for the war crimes committed.
---
&gt;A dps warrior blowing rage on thunderclap swaps...  is very, very non-ideal 
---
Still better than a tank doing it. Defensive stance thunderclap only became a thing in TBC, before that someone had to stance-dance if you wanted Thunderclap debuff. And you completely ignored my point about Faerie fire and Expose.
---
Did my first yesterday. Took forever
---
eh i mean, just go looking for him on arugal idc.
---
Drain tanking is amazing. Can never go back to blueberry.
---
He's right though..
---
Me 2, but i doubt it. If only wanting could make it so.
---
already have it+ some extra gold for whatever.
---
Max Claw, Prowl and Dash
---
Get some frost and shadow resist then rest in stam.
---
"A little _too_ late"
---
"Because then I'll be happy"
---
Post nut clarity is possibly the largest int buff in the game.
---
Shhhh... Go away.
---
It can actually be a little bit disgusting how good it can get if you go for full demonology. I found that if I stuck him on a mob and focused on another its very hard to pry aggro off of him. The extra physical resistance and Soul link makes you about on par as a full plate wearer as well.
---
I do that actually. advertize in trade channel for free boosts. so far i've boosted a group of people in dm and stockade.
---
This man is wrong, blueberry can't keep aggro to save its life unless you want to wand for 50 levels.
---
Once you can drain tank, go drain tank.
---
Which 50-60 dungeon wings (UBRS, LBRS, BRD pre- and post-Guzzler, Marau sections, Strat living+scourge) take over an hour to complete? I want to focus on getting all my gear from those first because PUG tanking longer dungeons like WC is frustrating, esp if people leave midway through.
---
Already know to skip ST, I doubt trying to do a PUG quest run of that will pay off
---
Not for endgame pve, but for leveling, absolutely.
---
FYI, this particular 3 man is only possible with this group combo pretty much and only once the paladin has access to t3
---
Are these the terminals in gnomeregan?! I always wondered what they said!
---
I like your group being almost perfectly diverse
---
"finally"

What? Even if classic didn't - it does lol, what you on about - it would still be a perfectly valid complaint. BFA is entirely patch focused, meaning one of the games greatest strengths, its decade of content, is entirely void save for scrapbook skins for your chosen clownfit.
---
How are you dying with drain life and siphon life? I could easily take 3 mobs at any level with it
---
Cause he clearly didn't get Aqua and had to use √§ to make it happen. 
---
It's like trying to get Legolas but it's taken. So you try L√©golas, but it's also taken

And then eventually you end up with people called L√©g√µl√•≈ü

Before wow classic was released I was a 30" waist. Now I'm 36"... Those galaxy ripples are deadly

If you enter Strat from the secret gate... and then go to the living side, the Unforgiven boss runs away... can he be reached somehow or you have to reset and enter through the main gate?
---
I'm proud of you

Just yesterday i saw someone "lfm strath living (righteous orb locked)" - i lol'd
---
That's not how the token works.
---
Gold is not created out of thin air, it's exchanged *between players*.
---
If you put a token for sale on AH, you don't get any gold until another player buys it, that is *he gives you his gold* in exchange for the token.
---
It's not an easy solution for anyone to get easy gold.
---
Could grind for your epic mount if you dont have that yet or just go gank people in stv if you're on a pvp server
---
In vanilla you could SW:P a boss once and it would likely die as well. We had a lot of window lickers doing that in vanilla.
---
Where do you put the ashtray?
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt mean the winning roll part.
---
I mean if you win the roll, could you use it at all without ever buying a riding skill.
---
Even in low 50s, you can get the moral victory with post mortem dot kills on 60s.
---
And if you don't, take the low road, soulstone and re dot.
---
In the first 20 levels! Surprise, these mobs are a thing, have fun!
---
More like people who post this crap :p  
---
Literally just don't join. It's that simple.

You came out of the closet as a fly?

So stunning and brave

It's just a shame his song is fire but his damage is like a ticket to the fyre festival.

---
So have your setup in same room as your partner? I've been doing it for years with her. Makes 0 difference if I'm sat on the sofa or in my pc chair. Clearly you don't understand compromise which is key to a healthy relationship. Only kids and weirdos lock themselves away when gaming
---
I've used this a few times and it is very convenient. You join the "Uber" channel and ask for a summon, get invited to the group, and instantly summoned. Upon arrival they open the trade window to pay and you're done.
---
What I wonder is if this is one person multiboxing? Is that allowed in Classic? Or is this lots of very dedicated and coordinated people?
---
In order for me to use challenging shout so he isn‚Äôt tanking 2-5 enemies...?
---
Hang on, do we have a problem? You understand Mages aren‚Äôt tanks, right?
---
the add-on "soulsort" does the same
---
You must be an American
---
Nah we want phase 2 so we can get the GOOD WATER :))
---
Some of it is, some of it isn't. I can assura you I pay 2 subs
---
I spent 2 hours in here because I had a drunk gnome warlock who kept fearing every mob. Never again...
---
All you have to do is put a renew on me and I'll keep.
---
I don't complain though, if I'm stuck at 20 HP that's what it is.
---
thats why you do borelgore and duskwing first. once you're at nathanos ruse you have the disguise as a failsafe.
---
Well him refusing to group is plain spiteful and I can see no reason as to why he would refuse. That being said it is ultimately his prerogative to decide whether he wants to quest with you or not. 
---
Tldr He is a jerk but he is within his right to do so.
---
Tied with priest? Sure priest levelling rotation is tiresome, but they are far from the worst, 5 points wand spec and 5 in spirit tap and then you can do whatever you want after that and still be able to dps/heal and solo all quests
---
I didn't run any raid spellcleave and maybe ran two groups of normal spellcleave, which wasn't my jam, so I don't really know what straws you are grasping at.
---
And I'm not defending the exploits, I'm saying that players will be players and optimize. This is all on Blizzard.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dae9q3/the_chad_monastery_warrior/).

I don't know why this isn't higher rated. Healer mana is like fuel for the entire party. When it's gone, so is your party. It doesn't matter what spell ranks the healer is using, it doesn't matter if they loot mobs or if they drink first. Ultimately, when the healer mana is gone, your party is dead soon after, every time.

Can you get more than 30fps out of your TV? I have an equally big TV and tried the very same thing, but max FPS on that thing is 30 and thats way too low for me....
---
Dude what fucking logic is this? If you did nothing wrong and blizz make a mistake, which they do sometimes, where do you go to? getting help from social media like reddit is the last resort to lift your ban. What do you mean no normal human who did nothing wrong would be posting here, that is some of the most idiotic things I've hear this week.

You get more story off of trying to get a random person to rp on a non-rp server &gt;.&lt;

Yep I made an alt on another realm after getting to 45 on Skeram because the imbalance was just not getting better, every zone felt like STV-lite besides Desolace. Took the xfer to Heartseeker last night, hope my guildies follow, a lot of them were also complaining about the constant deaths to Horde but are somehow confident it'll be better at 60/Phase 2.
---
It was most likely a fake.
---
In any case, the same sub will let you play both Classic and retail and your account should be up to Legion.
---
If you have a char that's at least level 70, you can create a demon hunter (new legion class), they start at 98 and go straight into legion content.
---
Not BFA but more that enough to see how you like retail.
---
Jesus stop calling it spellcleave it's aoe
---
Could you rephrase that question? I'm not sure what it is you are asking
---
normally ppl would do battlegrounds or farm honor but they arent in the game, u can still gank ppl but its not as fulfilling

Well done! This is gaming at its finest
---
So here's a tip.
---
Warriors can learn how to wield bows, crossbows and guns. 10 silver at a weapons trainer.
---
It's worth it, just for the ability to pull from range in situations like this.
---
You can always go enh to lvl then reroll

Is making misses with spells on skull player target is not a thing is classic? I remember it clearly you missed at players when I played in wotlk
---
Awesome
---
Lovely set up, but a bit overdone to me likings. I do a laptop in bed gaming. Total nostalgia set up as it's as fast as my pc was 15 years a go
---
Hurricane is much better than just bis for 49 bracket. It's ridiculously good with the iaoth setup as well. Hurricane is one of the few epics worth that kind of money.
---
I couldn't be more proud.

Mazzaranche, specifically. It extra salt in the wound to kill your enemies with a pink flamingo.
---
Isn't it up to 15 for UBRS?
---
I almost went to EF, people in world chat were very nice and I liked the idea of a near 50-50 balance, but every single "/who [instance/zone]" I did was 2-5x bigger on Heartseeker than EF in primetime. 9 in ZF compared to 30, or 20 people in BRM compared to the 50+ in HS. Hope it gets even bigger over there, seems like a great server if a little sparse near endgame still
---
When you have something Mind Vision'd you can cast it again on another target. Leapfrog your way to the goal and look around for whatever you want to find with a /tar X macro.
---
saaaame bro
---
&gt;Some of it is under vendor price. Some of it is listed so low the player didn't realize the AH fee meant they were losing money.

They know, they're giving it away.

Did this a week ago. Took 4-5 days just to buy the runecloth at 1,4g/stack back then. But I started buying runecloth at 1100g total cash, and ended with 1300g when I was exalted despite me buying all 16 slot bags and 2 more bankslots too lol. 
---
There simply wasn't enough cloth on the market. 
---
I was halfway to revered with darkspears when I started, so about 10k rep needed (500 stacks of cloth, 700g if bought at 1,4g/stack)
---
It's still shitty customer service. I'm not saying OP is rightly or unjustly banned.
---
Warlock and Paladins are buying on AH ;)
---
lazy? More like awesome!
---
Nah there's no trial for Classic, trying to login as one simply says "You need to purchase game time to play this game".
---
The worst part of classic quests are the Blizzard quests where Gnolls have no paws, Boars, have no liver or snouts, bears, turtles and vultures have no meat, murlocs have no eyes or fins and such.
---
Apart from that leveling is great, it makes you feel you earned your level even if some times it annoys you.
---
Old world was such but  i liked many of the quests and missed them after Cata.
---
By extremely lazy, you mean extremely comfy. I'm actually pretty jealous, because all I've got is my uncomfortable computer chair.
---
&gt; You buy a token from Blizzard, which you then sell to other players for their gold
---
that is not the way it works. it was explained in a blue post when tokens were introduced that the rates are set by blizz, not players. they have targets they try to meet by setting the exchange rates.
---
The legit makes me feel uneasy..
---
That's kinda how the endgame is.
---
If you don't enjoy endlessly helping out in dungeons or farming gold, better level an alt I guess. Not much else to do atm, at least until p2 if you're into pvp.
---
How do I finish the Helcular's Rod quest? The Southshore guards just keep killing me.
---
I play with an English client on German servers. So on start-up, the game always presents me the realm list for English servers. So I have to change the region to german and select my realm for every login. Is there a way to change which region is pre-selected?
---
(On retail it just seems to remember the last server I logged in?)
---
Yeah spell cleaving with full group of them is the only viable way. So tanking is needed if you're not doing that. If you want the run to be smooth anyway.

What bout the clutchmother?

I've leveled both, I know the score. Mages hard counter warriors for sure. But my point was that warrior was blizzard's baby, mages a close second. They had to be nerfed over and over because they were so damn good.

Does it give you au aura or a timed buff? I would guess a buff. Does it stay on even if you swap weapons?

Go kill opposing faction players, unless you‚Äôre in a useless pve realm. Than just go dick around in main cities or something idk.

&gt;"My contribution is so great and your contribution is so worthless that only I get to roll on these items"

yea , nah bra   
---
its like being at a 12 year olds birthday party who thinks they get to have everything
---
Splash damage threw him onto tree so hard, that he was presses into it.
---
That's how you go below "the pets" in healing priority.
---
still less extreme than ppl who gank and corpsecamp you right of the bat
---
Oh do you only start using the skills till you build up enough rage in general? Or is this exclusively for raids and stuff
---
As a bear druid who struggles keeping aggro on groups, I feel like your method will have us in the dungeon for two hours instead of one. I've also done dungeons as resto and feel equally unnerved by people who demand the entire group stops what they're doing every time they need to drink.
---
It's okay to lose aggro on some mobs. It's okay for the group to progress ahead or loot while I drink asap for a bit more mana on the next pull. It's also okay for my mana to not be topped off on every trash pull, or every mob to be attacking me when I'm tanking, most of the trash don't hit that hard. As a healer, I can handle the occasional dps tanking and as a tank, I can tell when my healer may need a bit more time drinking for the next pulls, otherwise drinking happens on the fly.
---
It's all about adapting and optimizing your run so everyone can enjoy their experience. People genrally won't think less of you if you lose aggro on one mob out of four, and your dps won't chew you out for it when they know it's their fault for focusing a different mob than the tank's. If you have a group that doesn't mind spending two hours in a dungeon just for each pull to be flawless, more power to you.
---
Holy smokes that is awesome! :D
---
Thanks for the insanely kind offer, but this video as kinda inspired me to pick up a decent bit of software and actually try and learn some stuff. I enjoy making videos as much as playing so why not do it properly eh!

I‚Äôm guessing he hasn‚Äôt heard someone reference the term pk since he‚Äôs played Diablo 2.

That's dope. #nochanges. Oh wait everything with us as players is different.ok change somethings

Multiboxing is allowed in classic yeah
---
Welcome to "You have to be in a guild that actually raids". One of the many things players hated about end game, actually.
---
Ultimately, if your kid needs you. I understand. If you wipe in a video game, we walk it and keep at it.
---
The truth is that there is very little to do in Classic if you don't raid or PvP.
---
Even with raiding there could be very little to do depending on the demands of your guild. You can clear all the content by just raid logging. Everything is extremely easy so you don't really need any consumables.
---
Play on oceanic dude

Seems priest DPS is near warlock levels and offers hugely increased utility in VE healing/Shields (not to mention Rez/Buffs/Etc)

Build some twinks for when bgs drop
---
Great now I have a new idea of how to piss off horde hunters thanks reddit!!
---
Or you can buy 200 throwing knives for a few copper and not waste bag slots with ammunition.
---
It wouldn't help in this instance anyways; in that area only a few Troggs can be pulled singly, even with ranged weapons.  And it only gets worse up the hill when he's sent to kill casters.
---
At max, + damage is usually priority, for leveling stats are worth more.
---
Aw SHIT he gotta *knife*!
---
Rofl whats your issue. I never ran aoe raids or abused layering for money and I'm lvl 60 warrior sitting on my epic mount.
---
I did this in EverQuest alot with my druid back in the day. LOVED it
---
\&gt;Everyone rolling need.  
---
I'd be pissed, that enhancement shaman is actually going to use it and everyone else is greeding.
---
as a RSham, i spend 60% of my time drinking while the group pull and fight. and i just ask my group mates to let me enough time between pull to let me sit down. 
---
10% of my time (and a lot of mana) dropping all totems for you 
---
30% of my time actually healing you if i dont get interrupt by the mob you fighting.
---
and always have my mana between 5% and 80%.
---
Sorry to not be fast enough to keep you alive. maybe you can create a heal or tank to understand or go to retail ü§î
---
Got mine for 10 g roughly 2 weeks after launch. No it doesnt. It shares CD with health stones however. Not that that matters much.
---
If you can pick it up for &gt;100g and you are a mana class it's well worth the investment and bag slot until forever.
---
As a Healer my 1 free potion/hour saved quite a few runs.
---
Oh yes he is playing a latency intense game. \s
---
Hdmi is not an issue itself, but tvs have crappy latency because they were never meant for gaming. Though it might be a problem in CS like games, wow - no biggie.
---
I really like how in the duel with the hunter that didn't send his pet after the enemy even once,  he mage kept running up to the hunter to try and freeze him in place, and then blink out of the deadzone anyway.
---
Good stuff.
---
man I was so pumped to play on 30-40 ping, having come from a lifetime of 200+ ping playing in aus :(
---
You said 10 seconds before AoE in your post
---
to stab yo ass
---
lol thats fucked
---
So many quests tho. Are you saying it's not worth it to go ?
---
No, not really just showing the other side sees the same thing.  I don't believe one side does it more than the other its just confirmation bias because you only really experience the bad side of it if you're not one of the people always group questing.
---
Im singaporean and playing on oceanic, rather than on taiwan. Its so much better for me as english is my first language and the 150ish ping is barely noticeable
---
o god try being a DJ, this phrase will make you want to murder
---
Maybe consider that the tank and healers are doing what they do for a reason. If I see a caster (especially the healer) drinking I wait for them, if the healer is topping them off I wait. Sometimes I know pathing will have a group nearby that I don‚Äôt want to risk. If I‚Äôm not generating rage I can‚Äôt get agro easy so maybe give me a sec at the start. If your gonna call on tanks and healers to check themselves get the dps to do it to.
---
The kids in the hall
---
Cry is free pussy
---
Fuck I've been vendoring them
---
Are you talking about battlegrounds or just normal pvp? I heard that battlegrounds are in phase 3.
---
Oh, nah that's dirty. I mean, I still do it if I'm pissed off but like I said I'll also try to futilely smack skulls (or at least try to land a poly without a resist on them before I die. If they get sheeped I win in my mind haha)
---
There aren't going to be any nelf hunters there.
---
No mailboxes for them to dance on. They're in Pornshire.
---
good thoughts, thanks
---
I'm using Auctioneer right now, and it appears to base market price on what items list for and not what they sell for. Is there a setting I can change or another addon I can use where this is not the case? I don't care what the item lists for, I want to know what people are paying for it.
---
Ew
---
Dude we ran SM GY together
---
Pick up First Aid and keep your food stocked. Both are pretty crucial to keeping yourself going. You could also pick up Herbalism and Alchemy if you wanted to be able to make your own healing potions, which is a bit of a gold sink but can be worth it. While leveling my Warrior, there were plenty of times where I very nearly finished a 1v2 or 1v3, but died on the last percent because I just didn't have a potion I could use.
---
And of course, do as someone else suggested, and pick up a ranged weapon. Thrown weapons don't require an ammo stack in your inventory like bows and guns do, and the lowest tier are also pretty cheap.
---
haven't run it with more than 7 people.
---
Jesus dude chill, did you mean to reply to another post or something? I have literally no clue why someone would get so nasty about something so mundane.
---
*cries in arcanite reaper*
---
I play on Grob.  About 90% of my experiences with the opposing faction have been us ignoring each other.
---
If you have a strong group, it's totally worth it. I wouldn't pick up group Gnomer. Try to find guildmates. I would also recommend being equal level or slightly higher, not lower.
---
Where are you fishing
---
Don‚Äôt worry about them usually when you ninja loot the item/s are linked in trade and general chat.  The specifics usually make it onto your server forums and justice plays out there.  Keep a log of all chats just in case but your fine.  Your friends and guild support you that is what matters.  This will pass and during that time I am sure those bozos will be outed.  They can only bully so much and if you are getting death threats file a complaint.

Having fun isn't toxic.

Some jerk blonde kid came by and kicked him off his mount while he was passing that tree. Then him and the chick he was with (real dumb hair, btw) rode off to that teddy bear village down the way.
---
Dirty traitors... they will be dealt with accordingly.
---
Recklessness prevents that anyway and all you need is rank 1 bound
---
The other answers already explain but I thought I'd just add on a bit.
---
Computers at their basic level don't really have any concept of letters or abstract symbols. All they really do is comparisons and arithmetic on numbers in binary form.
---
Back in the 1960s nobody really considered the need for anything but English text in computing. There are very few symbols in English, in comparison to Asian languages, even when you include upper and lower case and all the punctuation. So when the ASCII standard was drawn up it was decided that 7 binary bits would be used per character giving a maximum range of 0 to 127. The standard assigns each symbol a number.
---
So your computer doesn't really see a hyphen, it sees the binary number 45. We just program our text editors to render a hyphen glyph on screen when the binary number 45 is encountered because that's what the ASCII standard dictates.
---
I have 200 [Feathered Arrow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3464/feathered-arrow) which is a twink item, yes? Hunters, are these something you would pay good money for now? Or would it be best for me to sell in the future?
---
As a 60 holy priest what are some tips for soloing content? Trying to clear up quests and tackle any important ones but it's slowing down as i get more healing gear

John Michael Godier - event horizon - space/ the universe. He has a very chill voice too.

good choice

&gt;at what level can a 55 rogue solo [...]
---
At 55 I guess!

Yeet

Noone cares about your blacklist, it is not against any rules to camp npcs or feign death. Get a life.
---
Calm the hell down you unstable basement dweller.
---
I would've started a druid but the absecence of a normal rezz killed it for me... :-/
---
Does the wound poison also effect healing potions
---
Thats because they just dropped a patch. A patch that has about 2 or 3 hours of actual content worth playing. Everyone will be back to classic after they're done
---
Whats worse is I have to wait 24 hours at least for another ticket response to get this over turned
---
Lol what realm are you on? I have a toon on a mega server and a toon on a smaller server and both of them regularly have pugs going for all end game.content.
---
Level 34 priest. Having a hell of a time trying to get things done. Every quest takes forever because it takes ages for me to kill mobs. Wand specialization plus points in Shadow. Am I missing something or do priests become insufferable to play solo around this level?
---
this is a terrible video but fuck man i love less than jake
---
Oh look, a power ranger
---
&gt;The truth is that there is very little to do in Classic if you don't raid or PvP.
---
If you don't want to raid or PvP you probably shouldn't be playing an mmo period.
---
Wow. That is incredibly in depth. Thank you!!
---
This reply is just bizarre.
---
How has a simple question ruffled your feathers so much?
---
It's even more of a rub his face in it when you ignore him
---
Kind of looks like Roger from American dad
---
By no means this is Perfect, i am just a Shaman who also tries to find ways to make Gold.  
---
Hunter/WL will still be the best for Princess runs.  
---
Also note this run isnt perfect, if theres any questions from any Shaman or any other Class i will try my best to awnser them.
---
So nasty? Get some sunshine and a new perspective.
---
please explain how any of the points i made are wrong.

Set the level range, then click on Additional filters and scroll down to the stats section, you can add several filters with the stats you're looking for.
---
Additionally, he doesn't understand the concept of buffing/debuffing for his group (FF).
---
I am feral druid, who goes healing in dungeons when asked.  No way I am able to heal this style of play in feral spec.  So it's important to know beforehand what kind of group you are in.  the 2 hand method seems suitable for guild / friend runs, not so much for pugs.
---
haha thats a good paycheck if you auction it
---
Spirit tap is your friend.. It helps when the group is mindful of it and let's you finish off the kills.. Though even with ppl that don't want to play along it's fairly consistent. In raids, just pace and wand.
---
You can play moonkin however you want but it doesn‚Äôt make it competitive for most of the competitive content in the game.  Some specs are just Not Great, sorry dawg.
---
I think I just died from this comment giving me cancer.
---
really? just by nuking with all cds?
---
Using the the table leaf is absolutely genius.
---
Pull a mob, his buddies come along. Keep hitting the original mob while running away. Eventually other mobs lose interest and run back, while you 1v1 your target. Easy.
---
They are obviously just trolling and probs have  a rep of doing so. Dw about it continue on as normal
---
I think it was pretty clear about the topic already being discussed multiple times. Feathers ruffled.
---
Im done talking to your dumbass, you have not read a single thing I have typed out...
---
Oh shit so this wasn't a mistake? Dude I don't want to believe people like you exist let alone buy into whatever perspective you're selling.
---
not gonna lie these "reservations" sounds most retarded ever
---
like u go do the dungeon clear it for like hours  and then boss drops 1 or 2 items and then they are already reserved  only way i see  this working if people who have reserved gear give up on all of the drops in the dungeon like all boes/etc
---
Calling a weapon a "consumable item" is most Druid way to say "need farm gnomergan to be competitive".
---
Twitch streams, Nobbel for the wow lore
---
Gonomergan is dear to my heart. Having multiple ways to pull massive amounts of mobs, and one way to pull over half the dungeon in one accidental pull is what makes it one of the best made dungeons in classic wow.
---
ps-pray that I am not in your group. hehe
---
Tanks aren't needed if you're all on the same page and spell cleaving.
---
I‚Äôm more concerned about the guy who wants to farm rfc. Dafuq you wanna do that ü§î
---
There is no such addon for Classic unfortunaterly. You can see the amount you healed and on which person as a scrolling combat text. You can NOT make the healing numbers pop up on the person you're healing the same way damage numbers shows when you smack an enemy
---
My favourite reply when someone gold begs me:

What is the gold potential from Princess about, if you don't mind telling?
---
What? no. 
---
The player told op (after and before various insults) to kill himself and his family.
---
Reporting and moving on was 100% the right thing to do.
---
But then, a while later when he gets a reply, op is silenced by Blizzard?
---
The fuck? I'd be posting that BS too.
---
My favorite is the lifetap/hellfire combo of the idiot...
---
You can literally send 40 randoms into mc and clear rag as long as one person lnows what they are doing
---
Kill speed isn't the fastest, but the upside is that you should never have to stop to drink. Overall it balances out and ends up fairly efficient regardless of slower kill times.
---
Make sure you are keeping up with your wand since it is such a large part of your rotation. At 41 you can pick up a white vendor wand in any major city which will likely be higher dps than whatever you have at the time. You'll also get a significant boost at 40 when you can respec for shadowform.
---
im pretty sure the cross faction only implies you're working with the other faction, im not sure, nor do i care enough to worry about it lol, not like we're scheming
---
Haha - this is awesome. I've seen a few cool things like this pop up on here.
---
What was your nickname? Pm me ingame and we can play more if you want :P
---
Au contraire mon ami, you sound like the perfect person to run gnomer with. I'll just first nova and improved blizzard half the instance, would can possibly go wrong? Cold snap ready too!
---
If we have the same addon, you can go to the main search page of the AH, and in the bottom left click "scan". It will take a little while, but it will start to build a price base for stuff. The add-on needs to scan all of the items in the AH, it doesn't know the price automatically.
---
Feels good to be popular
---
Imagine getting honor for kills from release üòÖ
---
Ahh nice, pm me ingame and we can play more if you want :P
---
What's the input lag like on that screen?
---
Arugal seems to have a lot of shitty guilds, huh?
---
Woah. Slow down there, K√§ren.
---
Tell ppl that the spec ONLY becomes good after AQ gear level. And SL is trash in BGs a Conflag/NF lock does tripple the dmg you do and is not useless when he gets interrupted. Ppl always forget the reason SL sucks in grp pvp. When u get interrupted you do 0 dmg Conflag/NF gets interrupted on fire and then can still cast fear dots etc.
---
The 1v1 Scenario in which the SL lock shines is not realistic in WPVP and in BGs (flag defending Arathi might be the only exception). And not to mention that SL is completly useless in PVE like 100% useless
---
Thanks for reminding
---
Try felwood! There‚Äôs so many chokes there that you can always force fights. Plenty of reasons for 60s to be around and low to mid 50s players will be questing here.
---
This. You need a second account

Everything.

This is how a real RPG MMO, descendant of D&amp;D, should look like.
---
In Retail, you see ppl riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles and even low-flying missiles. So pathetic. I could never play that junk of a game.
---
See its daft that he gave him the green on a 100-100 roll, but you can't not expect people to roll on gear that isn't reserved, it just means they aren't reserving it.
---
Definitely seem toxic to ignore you whilst trying to sort it out though.
---
Wow I actually really didn't know that. Thanks a lot. Do you know if this counts for every talent of every class? So that weapon speed doesn't matter at all for proc chance?
---
Who downvoted you? You're clearly continuing the joke
---
Hmm but you can easy earn money for portals...always see ppl paying 1g to 5g if they are in middle of nowhere
---
You cant do anything really but report the two people or whole group who spread misinformation about you or reroll/switch server. But i wouldnt worry to much, in a day or two noone will care or know who you are.
---
Are you on Kromcrush?
---
Or perhaps he actually got reported for something, who knows.
---
Yeah I'm not 100% on it myself just thought I'd mention it.
---
Deviate Delight yeah? I think I was in that group lol. With the bugged mines?
---
I don't even have to translate this to assume it's the navy seal copy paste
---
Lmao is this the Fed
---
idk in my server (Shazzrah eu)
---
runecloth stacks can be easily bought 1g/stack  off people
---
so 11k runecloth is 550 stacks which is 550~ gold
---
I've gone first aid to save mana between fights also
---
I think the  GM in this case needs to be silenced for a week.
---
We got it on firemaw EU too.
---
Huh, I was wrong
---
This an RP server. The entire server relies on small community interactions like this.
---
I actually agree with him, and his replies are not nasty, just a bit stingy
---
Use it in your favour.
---
Tell groups ok, I can tank but I‚Äôll be needing on tank AND dps gear. If they don‚Äôt like it then don‚Äôt bother.
---
You don‚Äôt have to tank but you can definitely use it to your advantage by getting groups faster and telling them you will be needing tank and dps stuff.
---
im confused. i feel like youre agreeing with me. faerie fire removes armor which in turn increase a druids melee damage. thus, druids are meant to melee while casting.
---
Sure, that works too; though you'll eventually want to train for stat sticks anyway. It only takes up one bag slot because you don't need the quiver just to pull, and you won't run out of 200 arrows/bullets any faster than the throwing knives.
---
As for being helpful; in this instance, perhaps not, but in a general case it's often helpful to have a ranged option for a warrior.
---
Two questions- how do you have that picture in picture? I was trying to get a chrome extension for it but i failed miserably. 
---
Second- what is the addon that tells you how long til your main hand/off hand strikes?
---
Also i love stuff like this in world pvp, you're both cool people.
---
You're 100% right, it was fair game at the end of the roll of the item I wanted, but the rest of it didn't sit right with me
---
Another mage with epic mount :)
---
I'm not sure what the other servers are like, but there's been some bad press on Arugal lately. For the most part most parties and raids are fine though.
---
Not even pet is enough to stop blind+sappers !Thats why you go for eng and third pet

the one on Everlook was founded on the lunch day as a event guild from the blogger/streamer stevinho(famous for allimania). He changed a few days later to Lakeshire thanks to quees and founded it there to. The one on Everlook is the one I am in and we are an indepetend guild now. Don't know about Luciferon. Maybe a fan made guild.
---
I haven‚Äôt log into retail since I achieved flying...
---
You are not wrong. Why would anyone join a group when the items they beed are reserved? So stupid...
---
why are you using an axe as human tho!
---
I'm sure amassing 40 random players is quicker and smoother than 40 players who at least knew each other somewhat prior to the raid. Oh and since MC is the hardest raid I'm sure BWL AQ and Naxx pugs will be a cakewalk. No guild necessary.
---
/S
---
Okey dokey
---
I just find warriors gear dependent make sure you keep for gear on form and a nice 2 hander bring food bandages and potions and you breeze tho most stuff
---
So what you're saying is we should be stacking hit instead of spellhit as boomkin?
---
I never agreed with ghostcrawlers bring player not the class philosophy. I agree insofar that their shouldn't be useless talent trees like prot pala in classic, but bringing toons for stuff like bloodlust dispel tranq shot definitely adds to flavour
---
A lot of ppl already got it.
---
Ulda is the same.  First time through in classic we blitzed through till the last section where some of the trash was smashing me (i was the tank) and we wiped on the final boss 4 times because two of our dps could barely hit it.  In the end we only got through it by having our shadow priest heal it and our (higher leveled) healer offspec dps it because they weren't being constantly resisted.
---
We need a r/wowchoosingbeggars sub
---
I played vanilla, raided MC and ZG. it's like driving an old car because it's old without any of the quality of life improvements or better safety features. Like it's great for the nostalgia, but once that fades, you're just driving an old car for no real reason.

Talk to Geddon about this
---
You will need to keep opening and closing the window.
---
Ahhh - the kitchen table leaf... how did I not think of that?! I‚Äôve been doing something very similar, but using an old beat up / rough piece of plywood.  
---
Think it‚Äôs time to upgrade my setup!
---
People have stuffed them before but they make you say ‚ÄúI accept the fee‚Äù in a chat window to provide proof and I assume they keep screenshots. Most people seem grateful for their service so I don‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs a big problem. The head guy talks in his chat channel a lot and seems very open to advice and answers most questions people have about logistics and how profitable his business is.
---
Yeah or maybe OP cherry picked the screenshot ‚Äúchat log‚Äù and was engaging in similar behavior before or after the screenshot so the GM gave them both quiet time timeouts... As someone who has had to moderate Internet forums before I can almost guarantee this is the case.
---
Make sure your wand is up to date, if you let it fall behind too much then you'll have a hard time finishing mobs off before SWP runs out. Remember your rotation at this point should be Mind Blast &gt; SWP &gt; Mind Flay once or twice &gt; wand to death. Your wand is gonna account for like half your damage though so make sure you keep it relevant.
---
You should be killing stuff at a decent rate. I was questing with a warrior friend at that level and while our kill times were similar, it made a huge difference that he had to heal every so often whereas I just kept trucking to the next mob, always at full health and rarely dropping below 50% mana.
---
This man tried to vanish with 40 dots on him.
---
You need to close and reopen the the window to see the new stock.

I'm guessing I'm just unlucky haha.
---
So far in just lvl 25 in classic so it will be interesting to see this time around!
---
I did this one hit an ally with my staff...but guards didn't come for me lol
---
Amazing idea! Best use of warlock summoning ever. Mages can't compete with this, we are still portal freelancers.

How much do you charge for mage portals?

Also, do you charge per portal, or per person?

---
So when guild check raids release, do you expect pugs to continue successfully, or do you think most of the playerbase will resign to Bgs while the serious guilded players continue to raid, getting gear that eventually surpasses most available PvP gear?
---
You pay your sub, dps if you want. There's nothing wrong with that.
---
Best way is to camp AH and buy stuff cheap or people post stuff by mistake. Buy them fast or bid low for gold.
---
16 year old me would of killed for this life. Now me would live on the streets with that lifestyle :D
---
Goon Squad may get some hate for idk why but they were one of the best guilds to be in on Mal Ghanis back in the day.
---
I can do 200 dps already as a 47 ret. I'm sure 400 by Patchwork will be doable, even if I need to buy a few extra pots than most people.
---
Good ret damage is totally dependent on having a chunky slow weapon to make juicy soc procs and stacking crit to keep vengeance procs going. I can see why most vanilla rets didn't have this insight, but it's pretty easy to do with all the guides we have today.
---
I never said it was, there's a difference between time invested and mechanical difficulty.
---
Mages have an ability that buffs healing.  Mages are healers now.  Lul

A loving wife wouldn't try and control your life.

&gt;Shutting yourself away for a few hours a day/night to play WoW is rarely beneficial to a relationship. 
---
I think you mean, "Taking 'me' time a FEW hours a day/night (Note: Few) to do something you enjoy is beneficial to yourself as a human being."  If your significant other can't understand that, they probably shouldn't be your significant other.
---
Same, as a Warlock weirdly enough. Though less healing involved and more killing, controlling and keeping on top of my Stones. Its nice :)
---
It triggered from honour in Vanilla, but there's no honour in Classic yet. I'm going to assume that it will definitely trigger from PvP in Phase 2, and I'd be very, very surprised if it didn't trigger from PvP in Phase 1.

Time to get some folks on this one then, it's probably still not better than blackout but now you've peaked my curiosity.
---
ranged moonkin has shit dps because youre playing it wrong. a priest gets healer threat so they could use armor. a moonkin doesnt get healer threat. a shitty ranged dps doesnt get any threat. youre confused and inefficient.
---
Some of us dont want to carry you. Why dont you join a meme spec only guild so you can still see the content but not rely on other to carry you.
---
Why can't we even have the choice?
---
No a different guy rolled a 100 legit for the green. The guy being whispered got nothing for his 100/100
---
If it‚Äôs an actual upgrade and you are trying to stack stam and agi than go for it. But def will help the rouge or hunter more.
---
If you are willing to play early in the day, I manage to farm like 5-10 devilsaur leather from 6am to 7am

Sure, I would.
---
why the FUCK would a tank roll on this lol
---
So can we kill voone for my healing ring right below the troll?  You'd be surprised how often the answer is no.  It's like 2 extra trash pulls.
---
first answer, it's literally just called "Picture-in-picture" chrome extension, i use it for youtube, just turn it on in the top right corner if chrome, and can move the little picture where ever
---
Second answer, it's called "WeaponSwingTimer" also shows enemy's auto attack timer
---
It‚Äôs not as hard as people make it out to be. Pull up a map on wowhead on a second monitor so you don‚Äôt get lost, and it‚Äôs EZ. Just be mindful of the landmines the dwarves at the end lay, and kill alarm bots before they can summon lots of adds.
---
I think we are in agreement over the bindings. Yeah you‚Äôre being pedantic ;))
---
Can't call... Unavailable chat
---
we have the same use for the weapon... to hit stuff with it and do as much damage as we can.
---
Would you not just need 3 accounts with a bunch of warlock alts parked in each place?
---
I got the dwarf captain sword from the badlands quest chain done at level 35 (aawww yeaaah)
---
Hmm, you will need "Concussion 5/5" and Nature's Swiftness, maybe Call of Flame would also be good, the problem is you cant facetank her, she does insane amount of dmg. I guess as Enh. would nearly be impossible. But i havent seen any Ele Video before me except for Pserver's where she wasnt Nature Immune!  
---
So just try it :D

Balance is supposed to be a "Mage Knight" or "Battlemage" archetype, but honestly sucks at it in classic. Luckily this gets mostly solved in TBC by form attack power on weapons, Cyclone and Trents. Not quite a ranged tank, but a caster that goes into melee range and shrugs off the things that most casters have issues with. Even then it's not perfect, and sadly they abandon it after TBC, but Balance is a crazy good PvP spec in TBC playing it as a front line caster.

You're not wrong but it will be painful. For instance I'm a warrior tank and I don't invite warriors, paladins, or hunters to my groups. Unless I don't need an item they may take from me. Same with rogues. I gear out super fast dps and tank gear because of this.  So you can learn to tank well and gear up quickly or refuse to tank and go very slow.
---
You can't buy it yourself, but you can have a friend in the opposite faction buy it from you.
---
Yes, he meant casting the buff on yourself requires you to be in caster form. Just like mark, thorns, heals, etc., which means feral druids are not meant to cast those at all, of course. And he also said rogues wear leather and are meant for close combat, therefore so are druids. Logic has clearly been applied. Guess what, rogues can also wear cloth which is mainly caster gear. And their iconic, main weapon type is the dagger. There are caster daggers in the game. Rogues therefore are also casters, logic has been applied, we were blind all along.
---
And yet I still couldn‚Äôt find a SFK group after an hour of spamming trade. Only thing I wanted to do last night. Had all the quests ready, even schleped my undead ass all the way to TB for one. From 6-7 Pacific, which Is usually prime time and nada. Capped my fishing at least while I was LFG.

If spirit tap does trigger from PvP kills then this is what i'd be doing. Why not take it AND blackout?

Female trolls have always been and will always be the hottest females in wow.

&gt; in which case you can buy auctions another of your characters from a different faction has put up yes.
---
Not on the same account.

Harder as in what? That's like saying DPS is harder because you have to wait a bit, mechanically it's not hard at all
---
How do I change a font on an addon that doesn't have that option?  
---
I have weapon swing timer installed, but the font is different from my Elvui font and I'd like to change it to the same. But I know nothing about .lua files or what I should do to change it. I assume it's a simple fix. Can someone more tech savvy than me help me with it?
---
Lol if Thrall and Jaina get married to seal the faction dispute, I'll lose my mind.
---
I would do Hillsbrad foothills, then Thousand needles.
---
This trinket is just plain BiS for melee, theres no replacement until P5, if even then, because you would have to get into naxx and get some loot
---
Well Friday night after paychecks. Everyone probably out drinking. It should be better today and next week.
---
Everyone here telling you that‚Äôs fine and it is but just don‚Äôt be expecting any slots in the bigger raids when they happen . Warriors are the tanks for a reason . Higher level raids are gonna want the warrior to tank . But like everyone says you don‚Äôt have to.
---
priests dont have an armor debuff... taking armor away is USELESS for a caster. i dont know how else to phrase this so it makes sense to you.
---
See, thats what im talking about, theres no concrete proof one way or another.
---
I have a Tailoring and Mining on my mage. I'll probably drop Tailoring for Engineering once I craft Robe of the Archmage.
---
Which professions should I roll on my alt?
---
When I move the player frame and the enemy frame to a different posistion than default it automatically goes back to default when i restart the game. My friends have been able to move them without an addon and I have done exactly as they have but it keeps reseting. Any ideas?
---
Sounds like she did you a favor breaking up tbh. Stand up tall bro.
---
Man bear tanks are actually pretty sweet for most stuff on top of not really competing with anyone for loot. I dunno why anyone wouldn't get a bear tank for this kind of thing haha.
---
While most will agree if you are playing warrior dps, you‚Äôre a dick for not tanking, being as tanks are hard to come by. At the end of the day, you should play the game how you want, and not how others want you to play. It‚Äôs your subscription and you shouldn‚Äôt have to play as a tole that will bore you or make you miserable.
---
I was rank 3 europa dps as boomkin in wrath icc section, multigladiator as boomie, played in 3 top 50 eu guild, played boomie for 12 years and u say to me that im confused and inefficient, learn to play, u have some problem in understanding things i assume, or u just dont want to accept the reality. I think u are just frustated, and u should blame other people for saying u something real. U are an idiot
---
I'm actually fine with now hitting 60 for a while. 
---
If I take long enough I will get to farm DM for pre raid BIS instead of BRD.
---
Lmfao.
---
Oh, okay.
---
So mixing up some staff melee hits is gonna have bpomkin on top of meters?
---
There's a good chance those level 60s abused the raid bug in SM or layer hopped aoe mage to shoot up in levels.
---
So right now in classic it does not kill from PVP kills ... When phase 2 comes if you kill someone who gives you honor it will proc ..... I think I awnsered your question clearly
---
It's even more fun when someone in your group is drunk irl and decides to attack random mobs instead of going to the boss.
---
might wanna get a new set of eyes too
---
Wtf I love this!!! Ty for enlightening me
---
No lifers are NEETs
---
Most of the 60s with epic mounts and shit aren‚Äôt working, aren‚Äôt in school, and clearly aren‚Äôt working to improve their lives. 
---
I mean, good for them I guess. If you‚Äôre a teen or early 20s you have time to turn your life around. If you‚Äôre late 20s/30s and still doing this then you should seek professional help.
---
Taurens can't ride raptors
---
here is the thing as the one forming the group you can ensure you being the only one who can roll on somthing  by just nothing inviting X,Y,Z but insted of missing on people that don't need those items you reserve it insted.
---
however we are seeing a lot of people super greedy putting 3-4 items on reserve even off-spec items. if you really really need one item then it is find if 3-4 items is an upgrade for you but have normal drop rates don't reserve
---
Agreed. Skip rotgrip.
---
The game is 15 years old. Please.
---
smolderweb
---
I was legitimately thinking the same as I was reading it lmfao
---
Yes, Light's Hope guards killed our shammy cause he accidentally hit an alliance ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Save the memories!!!
---
40-50 is way tougher.
---
No not directly. A Rouge for example has more abilities that scale with weapon damage. So he has a higher priority. You always have to think of the group and in this case the whole group does more damage if you don't get it.
---
Problem with shared loot is, that everyone thinks they should be first. Which really doesn't matter, as you are working in a group
---
Lmao that's a lie tons of raids will take warriors as DPS .... Where did you come up with this ...
---
bad rogue is bad, he even had a level on you and he couldnt pull it off
---
Not sure man, 50-60 was very short for me. being able to quest with a mount and dungeon trivializes leveling
---
Cuz some people do. "If my loot isn't reserved I don't care" - those are the people who go along with this nonsense.
---
I never outright refuse to tank. I do it but I tell people that I'm not good or geared for it.
---
Not sure why I'm a dick for wanting to play as a dps.
---
Tauren can only ride kodo and wolves in classic.
---
I use Questie to make questing easier and details! to track party damage.
---
Would be like 100x longer if it was that surely
---
mage just cause of the fantasy of it
---
Spotify, some classic, indie rock with a side of keeping up with the Kardashians
---
Well russians are quite the specific breed, if you want to learn more about them i suggest checking out dota or cs. You will see their behaviour first hand.
---
ZOINKS
---
You do it when you are 60.
---
Just make a stealth spec farm 2 k gold so you can get your devilsaur set and epic mount then spwc back and start doing dungeons.
---
I have a macro that is  
---
/tar Goraluk  
---
/tar Rend  
---
the first one takes you too rends room where he pats and then you press it again and if rend it up it will target him
---
Playing a 60 Warlock and currently feeling a little depressed. Im having trouble finding groups for dungeons when my friends are not playing. Most ppl want mages in their groups. More dps, better aoe, food, CC.. cant compete with that as a warlock it seems. Raids are not a Problem tho, noone really plays warlock so its easy to get a Spot. 
---
Also you cant get your epic mount since the class quest is not implemented yet (really sucks ass). 
---
I had much fun leveling my lock and doing some dungeons with my friends but the solo gameplay is just really annoying. I think i will just let him be until phase 2 when pvp becomes a thing.
---
If you are leveling a warlock you should consider rerolling to a mage or something. Dunno if its just me being really annoyed playing as warlock atm.
---
P.s. soulshard Management already sucks.
---
P.p.s. dont get enchanting. Consumend like 500g for shit like crusader recipe, arcanite rod and stuff and now noone really needs an enchant from random guys since they all have their guild enchanter.
---
There are more warriors out there. Fury warriors are literally top tier dps and don't really share much gear with tank warriors so there's still reason to have them.
---
I never refuse to tank. I usually tell the group that I'm not very good though nor geared for it though.
---
Miss.miss...miss..MISS
---
In an inn or major city, yes.
---
Tigers and vasilisks in stv
---
Hail Magrethe!
---
Yea, like my entire fucking guild who legit just logged on for funzies on launch night then proceeded to never log on classic again, and then other people who think it‚Äôs nothing but a timesink and haven‚Äôt even made characters but then grind out 65 neck and push mythic+ keys outside of raid. I‚Äôm the highest level in guild right now at 48, and I think that‚Äôs really sad considering that I‚Äôm basically going to have to have 2 lives in WoW, a retail one and a classic one.
---
Again, im saying most will agree you are a dick, but im telling you to play the game how you want. No reason to get mad at me buddy. Just telling you how everybody else sees it.
---
Suck it up it's a fuking game cry baby .... Are you really posting about how some people bullied you in a game lmao .... Your life must suck

There have been multiple fights in LFR where a majority of people ignoring mechanics would prevent a group from progressing. 
---
If you did LFR before Legion and BFA, you should remember fights like Durumu and Lei Shen. Remember going into Durumu‚Äôs maze with 25 people and coming out with &lt;5? Remember how many stacks of determination it took for that handful of people to finish it?
---
And Legion was the last time I did LFR and I can remember plenty of wiping on Argus. 
---
Yeah, there are fights in LFR that you can glance at and make them fall over. Kinda like MC and Ony. But there are fights every tier that provide a challenge for the impromptu groups thrown together in LFR.
---
George of the jungle, watch out for that tree!
---
They do actually, I tested it with two separate accounts in the same server in the Barrens.  It was two entirely different general chats.
---
With the amount of people required to do this it cant possibly be worth the money can it?
---
Dude you are just another rebirth bot but you neither heal or do dmg no reason to complicate things
---
How high of a level do you play on getting? If 35, I tailoring and alch have good CDs for passive money gain. Enchanting doesn't require anything past level 5 for apprentice in order to disenchant any item. Or you could do some combination of gathering and/crafting skills if you plan on going all the way to 60.

To be fair... not wrong.

Obviously you can‚Äôt spend all of your time gaming and none with an SO. But if your SO is controlling what you‚Äôre ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to do in your personal time then people need to realize that‚Äôs not normal. Even married people get personal time. Or they do in healthy marriages.
---
Do they refer to any particular one?
---
Farm rep, farm mats, farm consumables, farm rare items, world PVP, help guildies, make alts, farm gold. 
---
Complaining there is nothing to do in a game that becomes a sandbox at 60 seems pointless. Maybe you're the type that needs linear progression and goal posts 100% of the way instead of self made goals. If that's the case then yeah maybe endgame isn't for you
---
Lol you have played shit lots. 
---
Do something else
---
Ha classic!
---
&gt;so I rubbed one out like a man and logged back in.
---
this sub in a sentence
---
Hmm probably around lvl40
---
Short answer : no.
---
YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
---
what the fuck that even means, that loot is reserved for me?
---
The first reply was they couldn‚Äôt find a group due to ‚Äúbeing on a dead layer‚Äù , but nobody spams /1 when LFG, its all done in Trade so bringing up other chat channels is an irrelevant point to the initial argument.
---
They can access the logs.  The screenshots are not necessary, and shouldn't be admissible as proof anyway.  It adds a potential element for tampering.  What you can do is assist them in finding where it is in the logs.  If you remember the time it happened, what chat channel, etc.  That will help them find it.
---
Perhaps when there's enough people they split the chats as well, it would make sense.  Because I've tested it a week after release with two separate accounts when there was more people, and there was multiple Barrens general chats.
---
If you want a second horse eventually, the stables in Menethil Harbor are the only place in the game you can buy a black horse!
---
Neither have you
---
You are legitimately the one who is trying to dictate how others make rules for their groups and you have the audacity to call *THEM* entitled? smfh.
---
Not Trade which is the only one that matters when LFG
---
Look for drakova on YouTube and IMO icyveins paladin guides are far better than Wowhead for holy Paladin in particular. 
---
Every other class Wowhead is a better resource.
---
thx for that red box i wasn't sure where to be looking
---
It could be a teamwork thing. I dont think the tank has to be the one decreasing armor. It could be another person in the group.
---
To add to this, Bear tanks can tank most dungeons easily, while paladins still have trouble in 5 man groups.
---
Vanilla wow is a little odd, tho. Enhancement shaman looks like it's intended to be a tank. Druid gear is pretty weird as well. So you playing boomkin for 12 years and being good in wotlk ICC means shit to be honest for classic wow
---
It seems like a waste of time, from the company's perspective, to manually check thousands of judgments for errors. Assuming the algorithm worked correctly (it obviously didn't), it shouldn't even be possible for someone who hasn't set foot in an RBG to even be flagged for a ban. So why would they check every judgment for something that theoretically shouldn't be possible?
---
solo face tanking elite quest mobs is also wonderful
---
You playing on razorgore EU? Think I talked to you about this lol
---
Yes, I agree. I just can see that quantatively 30 extra stam on a class that doesn't really stack stam will be negligible compared to 30 stam on a class that regularly stacks stam. 
---
The totality of the circumstances is what makes it a lock wep.
---
You sound like a Flat Earther, dude.  "Why should I believe you that the Earth is round?  You have no reason to tell me the truth."
---
what? i'd say most people on average wake up at 7 am, get ready for work and get back from work around 5-6pm, which leaves about 3-4 of free time
---
Soon to be 60 lock here.  I‚Äòve leveled engineering to 215 so far after hearing how needed it is for pvp.  However, I‚Äòm not really down for having it as a permanent gold sink.  I‚Äòve saved every green I‚Äòve found and have bags full of em ready to be DEed on my bank alt.  For a reletively casual player who will mostly be puging raids will I be able to make money with enchanting?  I‚Äòd like to have a profession I can make money with without a massive time sink and basically avoided tailoring because I chew through bandages like crazy.
---
Race restriction kills it though. I mean if you are horde and you don‚Äôt even get to play troll? That‚Äôs just backbreaking.
---
You could just not go outside like I do. Works like a charm.
---
was hoping I can do it a little before 60
---
am planning to farm fire eles for the last levels and was thinking to check for devilsaurs too during this
---
I can see... the code...
---
Yea the bear attack thing sealed the deal for me. You're hilarious
---
How dare you question our ability to play...oh wait we're talking about something that happened in a video game 15 years ago...
---
True, moron award goes 2 me
---
&gt; Not sure why wanting my game to resemble life makes me a ninja looter but okay...
---
I guess I'm confused, because in my life there are consequences for going against the social norms, which can easily escalate into punishment.  Are you like a Saudi prince or something?
---
I remember getting my first epic. It was felheart gloves.  I had a buddy there at the time and we still occasionally joke about how pumped i got.
---
Most people remember their first epics I thought?
---
Our raid MT/Guild Leader wasnt on one day, which was plain unusual, the officers were forming up the group and wondering where he was, so we are all in a private channel in ventrilo trying to figure out who our OT is gonna be and wtf is going on.  
---
He pops into the vent channel, and hes really quiet, he goes "he guys, sorry, there are these dudes walking around my house with guns yelling my name, i gotta go, bye"  
---
He was offline for the rest of the night, still have NO IDEA what the fuck happened, that was in vanilla lol
---
Good to know, sorry for spreading misinformation guys
---
First time player, heavily addicted, I was wondering if there is a macro for putting up aspect of the hawk and starting to auto-attack a target at the same time.
---
nothing, it's just the backfire effect in action
---
Absolutely this, I quit BFA 2 weeks after it's release.  One month into Classic I have a 40 and and alt level 20 and still having a blast.
---
Did you SEE the poster of Jaina he had covering a whole he was digging with a rock hammer?
---
It adds to it, it doesn‚Äôt reset it what the fuck
---
But DON'T turn to run.. strafe or you'll get dazed.
---
The succes of classic will last a maximum of 12 months. The game just isnt good enough to sustain long term.
---
Blizzard knew this when they said ''You think you do''
---
And they were right.
---
All people that say ''Classic good Retail bad'' will be done with classic within a year.
---
Cause it's all they've got...?
---
My rogue has neither. Redhand (as in caught redhanded)
---
damn thats like 50-100g an hour eh
---
Mages have 0 stuns
---
I'm all about support classes. I like to hang back and not be the center of attention. Holy priest is my #1 favorite.
---
Hi see you‚Äôre new here, welcome to r/classicwow.
---
I like this. Ultimatum.
---
All professional engineers snicker
---
Warlock would definitely be easier than a rogue. You also get a free mount at 40 which is an added bonus. Both classes are fun, warlock is definitely just an easier experience. You‚Äôll enjoy either choice.
---
OP wont provide the 30 seconds prior clip, so until then he is a liar.
---
Maybe but 55 in 14 days is really slow lol. Which is fine, but it objectively is. My 49 rogue is about 6 days played, which also isn‚Äôt blazing, and I‚Äôm not following guides or anything.
---
I don't see this. He just says, Moonkins should be in meelee. Not freaks can't cast abilities and specc stuff in balance tree. I think you are misreading the post on purpose
---
if not at 55 then when? it really has to be 60?
---
just bought a pair of these for 300g from some idiot. :)
---
WOW has always been dying forever, bound to shut down any day now.
---
At this point people should know better. In particular if they are still playing any version of wow.
---
The addon called MoveAnything
---
Wouldn't shoot be better than start attack?
---
Because of the nature of classic loot, I don't think it's going to get stomped out, but actually get a lot worse.  People are going to get the bulk of the items they want, and then start chasing whatever 4% drop they want over and over again.
---
Of course, the solution is to not pug in situations like that, but that can be hard as well.
---
I think it *can* take up to 72h for the sake of processing payments but rarely ever does it take time at all. As others have said, contact blizzard if you're sure it's gone through.
---
Gimme all your boes for free or youre a greedy dick
---
5s plus mats
---
Of course. This is what I do on those occasions. I've never heard any complaints.
---
Keep telling op that to make him feel good .... facts don‚Äôt care about your feelings.
---
thanks for the best luck wishes, i got that blue lvl 19 twink cloak dropped from a random bear, so your support must have worked :D
---
Lol but not lol
---
I have one. I‚Äôll post a screenshot of it in 9 hours when I‚Äôm home from work.
---
Title kinda say humor?
---
You sir are a gentlemen and a scholar
---
Its terrible,  seems like it came from private servers,  which was kinda ok there because of higher drop rates. But its terrible on live.
---
Broken tooth doesn't even look rare to me   is the stats that much better?
---
Yeah it looks like middle is an option but it's fucking not.  For some reason the mobs basically ignore height and don't care if you LOS down there.  They aggro both sides even from the very middle.  We tested it this time around because we always had done it left side as it was recommended to us before.  Now I know why.
---
Treat me like a dirty little gnome
---
hm that made a lightbulb go up in there somewhere, thanks
---
Not true. It drops currently. I have one on my warlock. Will post proof later today when I get home.
---
Dude, what the fuck. Don't be a dick
---
and that is was i love, i too was hoping he didnt feel corpse camped, so he spawned and ate, and i went and sat next to him until he was done, then he went cat form, and i put my totems down, and we just went at it again
---
His opinion doesn't validate yours, it's an entirely different class from wrath to vanilla. Are you playing a level 60 boomie attempting to be competitive in raid right now? If not your opinion on the spec, when you have zero experience, is absolutely meaningless.
---
You were just saying how difficult that 15 year old content was. Now you are deflecting?
---
I watched this for a solid minute and a half waiting for the kill
---
Yep!  They're actually on and show up by default, under the General Settings tab there's an option called "Hide Hotkey" that will hide the keybinding on the button, so just uncheck that if it is checked.
---
I wasn't referring to the rank grind. What I meant was, you will have a large contingency of players who: only play for PvP so Bgs are their main thing, don't raid and or don't want to have their game time scheduled out in that way so Bgs are the next  best thing, or who just give up on raiding (time issues, social issues like loot or other drama). Either way all of these guys eventually get trashed by players in high end raid gear. That's how it was back then and I don't expect there to be much difference now.
---
Ride the boys
---
Heartseeker is heavily lopsided towards alliance. Even at off hours I can't get anything done at my level bracket. Once 4pm ct comes around you're done roaming for the day. (Source 49 horde tank). Just yesterday I was camped at thorium point for half an hour by a druid at the fp. Even when ally aren't being griefy the competition with them for kills makes me want to get out. Unfortunately my only options is to head to Brazil or Latin America servers. Definitely feel stuck.
---
Issa joke
---
There‚Äôs been people showing us the actual viability of Prot Paladin since classic launched actually.  Are they amazing?  No.  Can they be viable though?  In a lot of instances surprisingly yes.
---
There is so much shit i dont even know where to start. Consumables are a big one. You could give me 1M gold right now and i would know where to spend it on useful things.
---
not in vanilla. it resets it.
---
Your example is just a bad dkp system.  A good one will have built in decay.  However, you don't want that decay to be too strong, because you do need to reward your long time raiders.  It's a balance that each guild needs to work out on their own.
---
In my experience, the weaknesses of dkp are the built in ambiguities.  For example, a lot of systems implement a sort of priority system.  Sometimes these priorities are spelled out up front, but not always.  Some guilds like to have a loot council override available.  As a raider how do you trust the loot council?  It is completely reasonable to have a solid merit based dkp system that will solve all these problems, but it's a lot of work to implement and maintain.
---
exactly :)
---
Ive done all the beginner quests and reached a point where the next quest's enemies are too buff... So I guess ill need to farm enemies to level up, is farming gonna be required from now on to continue? Aside from grouping up.
---
Unfortunately the player base begged for that philosophy because they felt bad that no one would bring more of a certain class if they didn't offer anything more than mediocre dps. Or the fact that you were required to bring certain classes because of their utility. 
---
Bloodlust for example, if you didn't have a shaman you were fucked.
---
I believe it‚Äôs %15 for neutral auction houses
---
I have no idea why everyone is replying to you saying how many warriors there are on their servers. You specifically mentioned the drought being TANKS. The vast majority of warriors do not want to tank, so it doesn't matter that all these people are seeing dps warriors all the time. Their input adds nothing.
---
I'm also a lvl49 rogue with 6 days played
---
&gt;My guild has 1 MT and 2 OT, the OT's were specifically told you get nothing until the MT is done gearing. Like wtf, he's main tank cuz he hit 60 first, not cuz he's any better. Let us all have an equal shot at loot and whoever becomes full geared first in that situation is by default the main tank.
---
This has to be the dumbest thing I have read in a long time.
---
OFCOURE you gear up your MT first. He's the single most important player in the raid. Should you also gear your OT's with \*some\* amount of gear? Ofcourse, but saying whoever has the best gear is the MT is riddiculous.
---
Puns like these are the reason why my gnome gets always attacked...
---
Yes... I sent ticket and now waiting...thank you all
---
&gt; you are unable to create both a Horde and Alliance character on the same server.
---
Please don't give out wrong information.. It's very confusing.
---
Right click General in your chat, go to Global Channels and activate Lookingforgroup when you needed
---
I don't think thats true.  Pservers admit that they didn't have enough data for many procrates and just did best guesses.  Your statement doesn't add up with the guys who tried to research and recreate that experience.
---
Awesome video! I will say if you don't mind respeccing later for your 60 build there are some pretty good talents for levelling like Setup, especially combined with Ghostly.
---
I have never seen alliance attack without outnumbering horde.
---
So wake up at 7am, work and home at 5pm, bed at 11pm-12am for 7-8 hours of sleep, that gives 6-7 hours of free time.  Play for 2 hours, you have another 4-5 hours to do whatever you else.
---
MC is so easy you could do it blindfolded. If your guild is mad at you for buying epic mount it's a trash guild. Or you're just trying to justify spending hundreds on your BIS tailoring robe and running around jealous on your 60% :)
---
First thing I thought of :D
---
You do realize people are free to not join said groups right? If I am farming for a 1% drop item from some dungeon, I sure as shit am not going to roll against 4 other players when it do happen to drop.
---
I hate you.
---
you know the chicken from kfc comes from factory farms where the chickens live unbelievably horrific, miserable lives
---
Why are you so upset? Who hurt you?
---
seems to be a general crypt thing, i first noticed it in stromgarde
---
Use feign death and your pet should use cower.
---
Mechagnomes in classic confirmed
---
Google your rotation for your spec. Get a swing timer addon. Bring buff food and pots / elixirs
---
This is why you always use a VPN connection. It doesn't matter if you're in Europe or NA - the external IP will remain the same.
---
Good
---
magic
---
Im 55 and I almost dread finishing hehe
---
I went herb/skin from level 5. Gathered and sold all I got in AH. I also did not train anything not essential. I had 50g at level 37. I grinded the rest in Badlands by killing the elementals for 2.5 levels. In fact, I had 8 gold more to spare after buying the mount.
---
Shaman because I hate myself
---
Well, my hand is usually standing in WASD, so my thumb is always over the spacebar or alt, while my pinky is somewhere between the upper ctrl (that some people call caps lock for some reason) and outside the keyboard, and shift is a really small key in my keyboard, so that moving my finger down to reach it while also moving other fingers up to reach the number keys requires some gymnastics.
---
What a coincidence I too am eating KFC and playing classic wow
---
Yeah it would literally take hundreds of people canceling their auctions, reposting, canceling, and repeating over and over again for your theory to be correct. It's not the add-ons that are dropping prices since they only undercut normally by 1c. It's the people manually going in and drastically undercutting other people that crash prices. Dunno what your agenda is against AH add-ons.
---
How much should you pay for food/water from mages and lockpicking services from rogues?
---
Watch out for that boomkin he has a knife!
---
Who actually said that? Four throw away accounts?
---
Just have a good personality and be friendly. That or make potions and flasks. Everyone loves potions and flasks. Its like bringing donuts to work.
---
A very-very fat gnome warrior charged him
---
I love the Goblin/Gnome Eng book that you get before choosing.
---
There is a comment from a goblin:
---
"Know that feeling you get when you finish making something and turn it on for the first time to experience the power and joy of invention as your device springs to life? ¬†Gnomes don't."
---
lul
---
I like your bear just casually becoming one with the wall. True camouflage.
---
I beg to differ, every heal has a spell that is only to help the group and not themselves, a ress spell
---
After you buy the chauffeur mount, you can use it at level 1.
---
Looks like an owner trying to get his cat out of a tree. I‚Äôd call the fire dept.
---
It's definitely net positive. I do this all the time rather than eat and drink. Let pet tank, put on CoA, drain life until dead, life tap down, repeat, you're at 100%\100%. Or close enough to it to keep on moving.
---
I have a healing set and a dps set with most stats/spell damage. It's still slow, but better than soloing with +healing gear.
---
Roast raptor is quite nice. Only one ingredient, gives stam/spir buff, could be vendor flipped if you catch good prices on the auction.
---
It‚Äôs a prank bro just find a new group smh.
---
some of the ogres in Tanaris are casters
---
Same here with healing.  Say what you want about communication and being up front, but it sends a message that you believe you're more important than the people you need to help you complete the content.  One anecdote that happened to me recently is that I was farming lbrs with a different guild, healing for their run.  We had done a few runs, and I passed on the first and second gemstone because I already had.  When the 3rd finally dropped, they all passed to let me complete my key.  That shared cooperation and respect is what builds a solid team. The next day I went back with the same people for more runs, which eventually completed their key as well.
---
As a shaman healer though, I will say that I only had 1 dps shaman roll on healing gear I needed while I was healing.  Fortunately I won the roll, but that shaman was quickly added to my don't group with list.  I guess I'm a bit weird, because I only take enh gear when nobody in the group wants it for anything more significant than vendor/shard.
---
GF and I started playing WoW Classic together. She was inspired by our antics to draw a comic strip. This is her first attempt. All credit goes to her.
---
I hope you  guys like it!
---
Are you *seriously* trying to defend this guy saying that boomkin meleeing will fix the spec's DPS problems...???
---
What‚Äôs the item if I may ask?
---
As a priest I would let you have it... Lol
---
&gt;Reserving anything is ridiculous. If you're part of that run you're eligible for loot
---
People keep saying stuff like this, but then they roll Warrior, do 70 UBRS and lose Mainhand 5 times. Then the same people realize it's just as easy making groups with Mainhand on reserve, and they start doing reserves themselves.
---
There's absolutely nothing wrong with reserves if you announce it ahead of time. In fact, I'd argue if you do 70 UBRS and roll against 5 other melee every single time you are just being stupid and wasting your own time.
---
It's because you're not doing aoe
---
Yeah let me guess they got spider wing. No thad, no 4h, heigan is a maybe lotheb is a maybe.
---
Thaddius is one person basically one shotting your whole raid, a lot of good dumbed it doesn't and still struggled.
---
4H literally destroyed guilds, the requirement of so many tanks was a major barrier, but even with essentially merging top guilds on servers many didn't do it, and repeat kills were often a struggle. 
---
Heigan and lotheb were not hard, but they could turn to shit shows really quick.
---
And that doesn't even include Saph.
---
The closest I got to killing KT was when a mage one shot me (paladin) with a frost bolt in Arathi Basin, and the pvp group gave me shit for losing BS. All was forgiven after they one shot or paladin at stables.
---
The only thing that can be said about Naxx is a lot of people took breaks as TBC was coming out soon and lost interest in raiding. But a major part of that was how brutal that was for a 40 man. You couldn't have people carried in many fights.
---
Carry a DPS set
---
While OP is rushing into double digit levels, I have recently narrowed down my character's earring choice to 3 possible candidates.
---
This. Classic feels like rock, paper, scissors. Each class has their own pros and cons and you know when you can excel in a situation or have to back off and rethink. Retail is like quantum rock, paper, scissors. In each situation you are all, the rock, paper and scissors at the same time.
---
STV is fine, people just go there way to early
---
Don't bother about meters also
---
Do people just have no shame :/
---
The only thing lazy about this is your level. Go so some grinding son
---
Report, block and move on because ppl online show their true nature so don‚Äôt stress yourself out and remember you came to Azeroth to escape real doe enjoy your escape ! I know I sound like an old fart but I hope you get what I mean ü§£
---
Correct. Any reserved loot should be made clear at invite, and again when the group is fully formed.
---
All you have to do is google WoW agility and show them what it says
---
When an item drops on grp loot, you can roll need, greed, pass. Since the warrior rolls need on an item that is for casters and a warlock also rolls need and the warrior won - its ninja. And he stated in chat even that it was for gold towards mount.
---
Its like that on a pvp server. So only a half lie.
---
This is actually something I don‚Äôt like about classic and please let me explain why before downvoting.
---
The great things in classic are the small gains: levels, spell ranks, talent points, gear upgrades. They all contribute to the feeling of slowly getting better.
---
The rep system goes entirely against that. I got to level 40 before I realised I should probably focus more on darna rep as you only get rep if you‚Äôre appropriate level. It‚Äôs kind of a slap in the face - I would have no problem going to teldrassil and working through all the quests but that‚Äôs not an option. You just have to grind cloth.
---
It would be a huge change and I‚Äôm not advocating it, but I think the game would‚Äôve been better if rep didn‚Äôt get slashed for being higher level.
---
i did it at 56 with garbage gear. prepare to use cooldowns. look up optimal rotations for s n‚Äô d etc.
---
That was my memory of vanilla as well.  The top priority for an entire raid team is to gear the 1st tank because that's the most beneficial thing you can do to get better.  If you're in a position where you're 2nd or 3rd to be funneled loot, that's a great spot to be in honestly, and you're going to get gear very fast.
---
At this point I'd rather group with a racist than someone who gets offended this easily.
---
I must be running with the teddy bear crew because everyone wants to group up on everything.  Mankrik has been fantastic, completely worth the wait that first week when the game launched.
---
vanguard on the anathema server disbanded after selling raffle tickets.
---
no idea if it paid out, when I think back on it. And even if it did, they said they were keeping 10% for the soon to not exist guild bank.
---
My friend is the priest who rolled on it. She is really sad at the moment, :(
---
And all we have is -"fake taxi"- dude lets you follow you and when you come back you lay dead somewhere. And I don't want to know what happened.
---
Is it worth going back to get the hypnotic blade in early 50s?
---
My other option is the crit chance sword from the goblin boss in mara.
---
Think it‚Äôs busy enough to turn a decent profit?
---
I really enjoyed The Past Weekend episode with Tom Segura. You should check it out
---
I always played horde back in the day so never ran it till recently.. well let‚Äôs just say I ran it twice , wiped multiple times in the same spot , abandoned all the quests and said I‚Äôm never going back there again .. I see I‚Äôm not alone
---
Thats sad man. Hope that you get to fullfil your dream this time around.
---
You must be on pve server, you can‚Äôt on a pvp server which most people play on. So they weren‚Äôt lying or making anything up, just assuming.
---
I play ally on skeram and have no problem getting groups
---
In my raiding guild the main tank is the GM.  If the main tank isn't a high standing member of the guild, someone who you know will stick around, you're already making a huge mistake.
---
Ive done all the beginner quests and reached what seems like the next stage of quests, and all the enemies are too buff to complete them... So I guess ill need farm enemies and level up before continuing with the quests, Is farming between quests something that will be required often from now?
---
This is what happens when your goblin rocket boots *don't* malfunction
---
Thats what i was saying? But thx i guess for agreeing with me.
---
wtf dude
---
Thank you for reminding me not to stress out over not being max level yet. Glad I've got more road ahead of me.
---
But seriously, I'd say level an alt if you're bored. Or play something else for a while.
---
Go to your server discord (can find the link if you need it) and get all of them blacklisted.
---
I have a small dick, you win. I hardly give a shit about the things I do today, and you think I care about how hardcore you view my video game guild from a decade and a half ago? You'll have to find someone else to troll or at least a better approach because this aint working.
---
WoW travel agencies :D
---
If your guild is half decent most raids should be quite a breeze. Having 1 or 2 meme specs aren't going to throw your raid. Also, a lot of people who play meme specs end up going the other extra mile in terms of consumes and pre-bis etc. when many other people aren't which often means they can pull decent DPS.
---
We've been 2-man running this with a druid friend (Ele Shaman + Bear) and got his HoJ and the first run but the leather dodge-pants took like 10+ runs.  
---
It's pretty fast if you do some sketchy skips and use 1 invis-pot per run, we're doing Pyromancer + Arena for extra gold to avoid getting instance-capped.
---
Kind of thinking of making it into a HoJ/Savage Glad Chain/Ban'thok Sash service, but might be a bit iffy with their abyssmal drop-chances :P
---
Ya they are morons. Wands don't get increased DMG from agility. They will benefit from the increase Crit, however, a cloth wearer will never be able to stack enough Crit while lvling to be able to justify need rolling on agility gear over a melee DPS. Especially one who duel wields. People are morons bro, gquit was the right choice.
---
Use a gun to pull one at the time. If two come try to kite them until the second one leashes. Enemies will keep chasing you a long time if you keep attacking them, so make sure you don't attack the second mob.
---
It gets much better from 30+ with whirlwind axe and decent gear.
---
Yeah we posted in Pagle server discord. Working on it at the moment
---
If youre not the master race/a class with waterbreathing you should keep a very close eye on your breath.

Awesome! I can‚Äôt stand crap like that. I guarantee it‚Äôs not the first time they‚Äôve done that, so hopefully it comes back to bite them.

"He who does the effort to make himself comfortable, isn't lazy"
---
No I said this guys worthless opinion about a class he's never played, is indeed a worthless opinion.
---
Strangely I really enjoy listening to him when he is on other people‚Äôs podcast but not his own for some reason. Maybe its because i don‚Äôt follow sports but he gets into that sort of stuff sometime? I don‚Äôt know
---
But Witchblade+Drakestone is better?
---
That's honestly a dick move if it's gear that the healer currently healing would benefit from.  I would certainly ask someone to drop if they said that.  Absolutely, all the power to you for os rolls, but the actual healer should be getting the healing gear.  In fact I would just leave as the healer if someone said that.
---
You're right. And my guild just cleared MC with only 37 people last werk. It doesnt change the fact that meme specs would be carried. And like i said if guilds want to bring sou i think thats great. What i think is selfish is criticizing guild who dont want to take youm they have their right to not want to carry you.
---
I have a job like you that allows me to be semi AFK all day and what I do is mine hoping for arcane crystals and do the archmage farm (rogue and Druid only).
---
No, I am not doing 200 BRD for Ironfoe only to roll with 3 other melee when it drops.
---
Unfortunately if you are planning on mostly dungeoning. The questing won't be that difficult. It's just that nobody really goes out of their way to find a rogue to fill their party.
---
As a mage I don‚Äôt expect anything if my lvl allows me to make stuff quickly , usually just a time thing.  If i just learned a new rank of water or food that you need I can only make 2 at a time and I usually try to avoid having to make for people.  Once I can make 10-20 each cast it isn‚Äôt any problem for whatever amount.
---
I thought the same thing...
---
Man the same thing happened to me. Made account in Canada, went to Portugal for a trip and played a few days there on my downtime, came back to Canada played a few days then 30 day suspension

Why do you need such a macro?
---
If you want to make money with at least one of your professions, wouldn't it make sense to go for one of the gathering ones? On my server, Herbalism is pretty good money. Skinning is decent too, with Devilsaur.
---
Enchanting is generally not a moneymaker unless you get it really high and can charge people for some rare recipes, which is not something you will be doing. It's expensive to level up. 
---
You don't need engineering for PvP, it's just very good and useful. You also don't need to level it up that high to use most of the PvP gadgets, so don't burn your money doing that.
---
Yes mid 30s works better. Going there at 30-32 is a bit of waste of time.
---
Not everyone lives next to the place they work my friend for example I have to wake up at 6AM, get ready for work, leave house at 6:45 and  I get back home at 6:10-6:30pm even though I finish at 5pm due to heavy traffic, get changed, shower, and its 7:30pm that leaves 3 hours of free time if I dont want to feel exhausted the next day

Sorry to be that guy, but it's fathom

Aye, I tempted fate and played the ultimate price.

There's itemrack, but I'd prefer to have Outfitter

By this I mean people who use the who function to form parties will usually not search for a rogue until last. Or whisper everyone else available before whispering the rogue.

&gt;as opposed to trying to convince other people to. 
---
You argued that there is enough stuff to do. Or to quote you:
---
&gt;and there's more to do now than there was at any point before.
---
Thus you have to live with people trying to argue otherwise. If you don't want people to disprove you then don't start with something like this.
---
Like in a day?  Cuz either way nah
---
Isn't that epic chest mail?  You're talking about the one that's bis for enh shaman right?  Am I incorrect, or shouldn't it be OS roll for a plate tank?  There are not really any mail tanks.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11726/savage-gladiator-chain
---
It‚Äôs an awesome add on! You do have to scan the auction house for it to collect data and history which takes 5-20 minutes on my server depending on the time of day.
---
Keep in mind that portals require reagents that are 20‚Äôs a piece. So at a minimum cover that cost.
---
I look at as if I had to buy what‚Äôs the cost? 6 stacks of food/water is well over a couple gold. If I get that I‚Äôm tipping 1g. Portal probably similar 1g.
---
The lockbox is probably more about number of boxes. Minimum 50s for a box. 1-2g if doing multiple.
---
It's quid pro quo.  If you're the reason they're able to complete the content, you have the leverage to make those decisions.  It's a bit sketchy when you recruit people you need to complete the content, and tell them they can't have something though.  The favor is the invite to even do the content, which just isn't going to work on a tank or healer, and I don't understand why people try.  And if I'm honest, it's even a bit disrespectful to do to dps too.
---
Sucks it doesn't work for YouTube TV
---
I love playing shaman because it's the ultimate support class.
---
Mages want you for your mana tide, warriors and rogues want you for your windfury, you can off tank if you grab a shield and rockbiter your one hand, you can get some dps in while you're healing spec thanks to flametongue and windfury, everyone wants you for Rag because you have fire resist totem.
---
Plus you get ghostwolf for fast traveling pre-40, reincarnation for when things go silly, and water breathing/walking for annoying underwater quests.
---
Low effort
---
Unless you have your auction house game on lockdown or get a very lucky epic boe drop, less than 1% of players would have enough gold for an epic right at 60.  Most people will be 60 and long since preraid bis before they have the gold from traditional means like grinding or dungeon farming.  
---
I believe in 2006 I was just doing laps around ungoro, EPL and winterspring to sell stacks of thorium and arcane crystals between dungeon groups to save the gold up.  
---
The lv 40 mount comes pretty naturally from questing and potentially not buying all your abilities, you can do almost nothing extra and have enough gold by 40-43.  Epic mount is getting very lucky or steadily chipping away over time.

So a warrior rolled need on an item.

Hard doubt on your story.
---
That's the 2nd movie. I need to give it another watch, but I seem to recall it was just horrible compared to the first one. I think it was even rated PG-13
---
Same. I unlocked flying the day before Classic released. Haven‚Äôt gone back.
---
You say that but just wait 8 months and you level an alt and need a lbrs clear for onyxia chain and you been asking for a tank for 3 hours and don't have fuck all to show for it.....
---
I wasn‚Äôt going to, what with no honor and all... then there was a 50+ rogue camping nesingwary. So I killed every alliance in sight for two hours. Only died once when a group of four of them banded together to perma-stun me.

I mean sure, if that's what GM said forthright. Clear communication is big part of fairness afterall.
---
But instead they said a guildie needed it.
---
Regardless of whether you considered it ninja looting, it would seem the GM probably did since he lied about it.
---
Retail BFA spoilers.
---
alright...i'll correct the official records.
---
Cant See his lvl, can only see the afk ...
---
Dude needing to put shit on ah is ninja. Straight up. Greed even has a coin as a symbol. It indicates "I want that shit for money".
---
I spent the first week or so without auto loot because I thought auto loot was added in a later expansion, but i was thinking of AoE loot.
---
5Head
---
How would he take his dick tho
---
With how fast groups are going a lot of times we only have 10 seconds or so to drink. I would like to see classes other than healers drinking via eating mage food and warlocks tapping to 50% health and 50% Mana and regenerating from there.
---
Of course that‚Äôs true, but the whole fun of doing dungeons is that there‚Äôs a tiny chance you win something you need. Buying on the AH ruins this part of the experience. (it‚Äôs comparable to why loot boxes are so popular)
---
It‚Äôs just decency to let only the people need who‚Äôre actually going to use the item, even if it means you have to pass on a mountain of gold.
---
Now there are plenty of people who feel otherwise, but at the very least allowing needing for the value of an item should be approved beforehand. Otherwise the default is greed for the money and need for the utility.
---
that warlock's name? albert einstein lincoln.
---
What am I looking at here?
---
What addon?
---
I was asking myself the same thing the whole time. Your post made me more sure that they have to wait for phase 2.
---
Is mooncloth useful for anything except making the bags? it looks like the only other things it makes are armor items with a pile of stats. Do people ever buy the mooncloth armor? I would think most people would prefer gear with +damage or +healing to a pile of stats but maybe I'm missing something.
---
Hydrated watersports?
---
I'm seeing this for bloody dungeon runs in the 20s, its ridiculous. 'LF1M dps for deadmines, no leather' 
---
Whatever gear people get will be completely irrelevant in a week or two and twinks arent a thing for months. Its frustrating when some of the dungeons that are already harder to find groups for have ridiculous requirements put on top. The idea of reserving specific items in a gamr where the whole basis of gear acquisition is random chance is absolutely ridiculous.
---
first i tried with paypal and credit card same sh\*\* ...still frozen acc, but then took my money from card...
---
then they go to the next three bosses and rogues top the meters until recklessness comes back up again in half an hour.
---
&gt; There's absolutely nothing wrong with reserves if you announce it ahead of time.
---
I mean, you're still disadvantaging that person.   UBRS is a good example because someone might go for ony attunement, even though you're not allowing them a chance to roll on a piece of gear they might also need.  
---
I know I won't set reserves on pugs.  I'd try to get a guild group together.  Preferably, with people who don't need what I need, but need something else nearby.  You can almost always make that work with no reserves.
---
I tanked it two nights ago as a 41 druid. I had a great pug in the wee hours so we're desperate for a tank so I got the invite. Smooth sailing until the final boss who was 7 levels higher than me. We made it through that fight with only dps alive but it was brutal.
---
At one point everything was going haywire so I burned my challenging roar. 4/4 mobs resisted. What more can ya do?
---
Disclaimer: GM was not the person who ninja‚Äôd it. It was a tank from his guild. But the GM said that a guildie needed it so that‚Äôs why the tank rolled on it. Just wanted to put that out there.
---
What were your reason for rerolling to warlock?
---
My man!
---
Can you speed this up with casting Fire Nova when she is close?
---
Next up: Waterwalk rotgrip kite
---
In WoD you could get titles for killing specific races for a garrison building quest.
---
2k gold? How much does a run provide and what is the time per run? And what exactly is awarding gold here?
---
A good chunk of the layering fanboys.
---
Still happens sometimes. Thing is, defending stormwind/org/etc. for the 243rd time gets old, especially when it's usually a full, semi-organized raid group that will avoid the bank/AH/high-pop areas where they'd get mobbed. Gets tedious, especially when you can just opt out via turning warmode off now.
---
Join a guild? Start own group? The Meta is no CC at all so who needs polymorph. Can't relate to the problem at all. The fact that mage is the best QoL class in the game is widely known...
---
Part of classic is not a bunch of retards blindly listening to someone on reddit
---
Are you a DPS?
---
Also your best bets to find dungeons like these are by going into the barrens, joining lfg channel or going to SFK. For example, there are 10 times more lfgs in SM for SM than there are in total in trade chat and lfg chat combined.
---
It is like playing a pure arcane mage: a huge burst of damage, until you run out of mana 3 seconds later.
---
At great speed.
---
Gotcha .. god I love classic .. the fact that that‚Äôs bis and it‚Äôs probably around a lvl 30 weapon and then you have bis for some warrior slots is leather gear..
---
For only 3 charges my lazy ass can skip the mace.
---
its the broken class when a 30 min cd is up...for most of the raid it's all about rogues and mages.
---
The priest tailoring robe (Truefaith Vestments) takes 10 mooncloth, but I don't think many of the other craft able items are that desirable, no
---
As a Rogue I don‚Äôt expect anything really.
---
So would that be end game as a DPS or healer?
---
ive never played anything other than classic druid since 2006. and you dont mean learn to play, you mean learn to play the same way you do.
---
I'm at lvl 43 now so a bunch of my uldaman quests are getting green now, but iirc the suggested lvl range starts at 41 so i'm been unsure if I should go yet. I'd like to do a run to only do the first part of it, just to finish the quests.
---
Its pretty easy to farm and is BIS till phase 3.
---
actually they can kill you, but they will be attacked by guards in return.
---
Quickfix 6.2
---
The dwarf mines were seriously bugged when I ran it last night. They exploded instantly, no chance to kill them at all. My group said it's been like that for at least a week. Made it anyway but we just dragged the kids backwards constantly.
---
Right, so he shouldn‚Äôt have rolled need on it, because he didn‚Äôt need it. Priest has been farming for that pattern. To them, it‚Äôs not ‚Äújust‚Äù gold. It‚Äôs hard work, not being paid off.
---
Can see that for sure, I‚Äôm personally going boar cat wolf, or maybe owl so I can farm some stuff first then swap to wolf
---
Druid lvling style 1-9, 10-19 and 20+ is completely different since you use different forms. 1-9 you use spell a lot but mana regen pretty quick anyways. 10-19 you can open with spell and switch to Bear form, once the mob dies your mana should be regen so rinse and repeat. 20+ you have Cat form which is your ultimate leveling form. At this point, spells cost a lot more mana so you will want to only use mana for heal and strictly stay in Cat form.
---
The best thing about druid is your mana regen when you are in non caster form so if you use forms effectively you should have minimal downtime between pulls.
---
Is that the center leaf from your fucking table.
---
Moo.
---
Needs a punchline
---
I don't really know what to tell you man. You hit raid logging with the game not even being out for 35 days. I can't even imagine what your /played looks like.
---
But it's fun and has good quest rewards so maybe just do it for the hell of it. At least once.
---
It reduces all healing received, which includes potions.
---
Meanwhile I'm getting corpse camped in Badlands by a 60 multiboxing Lock
---
I have a better add-on for that; it's called a second monitor. ;)
---
Congrats! Now you can upgrade your bags and repair.
---
&gt;Of course that‚Äôs true, but the whole fun of doing dungeons is that there‚Äôs a tiny chance you win something you need.
---
But this fun still exists. Most items that drop in dungeons are BoP. BoP items cant be bought from other players so they can't really be expressed in a gold value. Needing on a BoP item you can't use pretty much means you're going to vendor it, which would never come close to the value it represents to a player that can actually use it.
---
&gt;Now there are plenty of people who feel otherwise, but at the very least allowing needing for the value of an item should be approved beforehand. Otherwise the default is greed for the money and need for the utility.
---
I think that in an ideal world (of warcraft) all players would approach it in this way. But that's not the reality of the game. And choosing to roll greed on BoEs when other players are needing is a losing strategy.
---
Ain't too bad
---
No, it does not. Stop spreading nonsense please.
---
&gt; (5 mans, 10 mans, 40 mans....dosen't matter what size content)
---
That really does matter though.  5 or 10, I don't think it's reasonable to reserve.  40 is a lot different, because you probably have a large majority of that 40 who are in there every week trying to work towards those items.  I think if you need to take a pug to your MC you should absolutely let them roll on MS, maybe with a 1 item per person (you'll almost never see round 2 that way), but I think it's perfectly reasonable to reserve very rare loot, or even patterns etc.  Those items tend to either go to the guild bank, a specific raid member, or the crafter that can use them anyway, and they continue benefiting the raid from that moment on.  At that point, the pug is also relying on the raid who's benefiting from those items, and giving it to the pug does not improve the raid.
---
I‚Äôm not even planning on doing it. I don‚Äôt intend on ever visiting dazaralor ever again
---
Stop poking me!
---
Wow are you serious, are you apart of &lt;Surprise&gt;? Why would a reddit moderator stop the community from exposing a guild that treats its raid members like trash. This is unbelievable that this happened, imagine raiding for 3+hours, expecting a fair shot at loot but the raid leader never gives you a chance at loot. A complete waste of time and false hope, helping a toxic guild clear MC without any benefit to yourself. This is NOT a witch hunt, this is how WoW stays balance. By revealing the asshole guilds for everyone to see. Also the orginal post wasnt mean, just honest.
---
Okay, look at those charts, this dude claims to be outdpsing that with no buffs and no enchants and bad gear.
---
On top of that, you need to remember that these fights are all super short, so the priest doesn't have time to oom, once fights go longer you'll see a heavy drop off in their damage.
---
&gt; Basically it's not a problem.
---
Of course it's a problem, if you have more than 1 sp in your raid you're actively screwing over every other member of the raid.
---
Omen is a buff. Of course you can‚Äôt use it while shifted. You buff yourself which lasts 10 minutes. Similar to thorns and Mark. Which are also not useable while shifted. 
---
Then, once casted it will proc off of melee autos while in cat and bear form. Are you new to druids? I know you claim to not be from retail, but that‚Äôs basic knowledge.
---
Ah yeah makes sense! Yeah we have a lot of those!
---
Just look for priests or people who have a hard time questing and pretend to help them. Do quests together. Tank mobs. Get mob exp solve a few quests here and there. You will slowly but surely climb. Also remember : if you dont have a collect quest from mobs all goes to the person helping out and nothing gets them more excuted as doing less work and getting the same reward...
---
The real reason you're being pressured is because the leader doesn't want to find a prot/feral tank. Their failure to wait isn't your problem until the wait bothers you also.
---
I would say "I advertised and joined as DPS". If you're okay with the group falling apart if they can't find a tank then stick to what you enjoy playing. Sometimes you will, sometimes you won't. **You're playing the game for your enjoyment, not theirs.**
---
A poor warrior makes money by selling stuff to even poorer warriors.
---
Sounds about right.
---
What addon do you use to put debuffs on enemy name plates?
---
I see Podesta in the bushes!
---
laughing so hard at something like that is pretty sad
---
The solution (to them) is to remove layering and have great servers. And then complain about the server queues/stability being insane and how blizz needs to do better when it fails.
---
Though, in fairness, there are people who would honestly prefer the queues/instability/lag.
---
Sorry not a set I just meant matching gear :)
---
My void must be broken because he drops aggro to corruption alone.
---
I play a warrior. But So far Ive been skipping out of dungeons due to these spellcleaves etc.  There are so many weird things going on atm. 
---
Except I did SM GY once. I joined as dps. They wanted me as dps. We get starting, and I ask whos tanking. "YOU are" Sure, I say. I switch to shield and run towards the first pack.  Before I get in range of charge, the mage starts channeling his blizzard. He pulls another pack by accident as he tries to kite. Blinks into a third pack. Frost novas. Blizzard, blizzard. Im incombat, so couldnt charge. Non of the mobs are hitting me. I can taunt one. Who turns to the mage again after the taunt has run out. 
---
Needless to say, the mage dies. The healer dies when the mage died, because now he has all the aggro. Me and the rogue, who was 4 lvls above me manages to kill them, when the others are dead, so I can actually get some rage and aggro :p
---
Inc the barrage of rage from the mage how terrible I am. What a little s\*it I am. etc etc. :p 
---
Aand then I got kicked.  &gt;&lt;
---
I did like that yesterday. Some ogres have an attack that launches you into midair. Ôøº
---
He probably did need it. He needed the gold value of the recipe just as much as your friend did. If you want to make sure you get an item when it drops you should reserve it. I know reserving items gets a bad rep sometimes. But it's completely legitimate and it protects yourself from situations like these.
---
not really something for people not interested in retail but pyromancer has a lot of lore speculation videos to listen to
---
Quick question on gearing a warlock. Today I ran RFK and got the Swinetusk Shank (Dagger, +6 stam, +4 spirit) as well as the Mystic's Sphere (+2 stam, +3 spirit). 
---
I have been using staves exclusively (lvl 28), currently have the Staff of Soran'ruk (Increases dmg done by shadow spells by up to 9)
---
Which is better to use? Should I be looking for daggers/swords/orbs as a lot of guides say? Or stick to staves while leveling?
---
not this again

It's fun just scanning through the guild names over at ClassicRaids' [WoW Classic Guilds](https://wow.classicraids.com/guilds).  As the creator of the site it's a fun way relax and review the community :)

\[H\] \[KROMCRUSH\] &lt;ForTheKingGaming&gt; is a Christian / Family-Friendly Guild
---
\*\*For the King\*\* , formerly Fear The Lord, is a Multi-gaming and Multi-platform Christian Gaming Community that invites players of all ages and backgrounds. We are a mature community that is interested in clean, competitive, and fellowship-based fun. We are roughly 150+ strong and majority of the members are married with kids.
---
\*\*A Christian Gaming Community, is that a joke?\*\*
---
Weird right? However, a goal as a Christian community is to set standards of respect, morals, and maturity that most communities consider inadequate to the growth of their guild/clan and the impact it has on people. Being a part of a Christian community isn‚Äôt about being religious, it‚Äôs about living out a set of beliefs in all areas of life, including gaming. Our overall mission is to develop leaders, build disciples and represent Christ through gaming.
---
\*\*What does a membership with For the King (4KGaming) look like?\*\*
---
We have a long history in the gaming community dating back to 2004 when we were only a Counter-Strike 1.6 clan (known as Fear the Lord back then). However, we have only recently added WoW to our gaming list and are very much interested in growing it. For the King has a lot of stuff going on and would love to add to our ranks.
---
\*\*Here are some of the perks of joining our community.\*\*
---
\* Sergeant \&amp;amp; Officer positions available
---
\* Ministry and fellowship with believers
---
\* Mature community with adult leaders
---
\* Command staff are mostly comprised of former military, law enforcement, first responders and other service based leaders.
---
\* Professional website, forum, and community profiles
---
\* Quality game servers, for games that require them
---
\* Organized and structured, while maintaining a laid-back environment
---
\* We place real life, family, and our relationship with Christ first
---
\* Organized Instances, Questing, \&amp;amp; PvP
---
\* For the King is a non-profit organization and opportunities can expand outside of gaming.
---
\* and so much more!
---
\*\*How big is your guild?\*\*
---
We are still just starting, but we are growing. All our members are currently leveling. As typical, we could always use some tank and heals, but all are welcome!
---
\*\*Do I have to be a Christian to join?\*\*
---
Nope. Anyone who is willing to follow and maintain our rules is welcome to join. We strongly believe in respecting each other and everyone‚Äôs beliefs, so why not give something different a try?
---
\*\*Do you have any voice servers?\*\*
---
Currently we use Discord for our activities. We are ‚Äútesting‚Äù the waters with Guilded.
---
\*\*What games do you play?\*\*
---
Our members play all sorts of games with each other but some of these games we have adopted to support. Supporting a game means we provide resources, advertisement, costs, leadership, etc into growing the clan/guild.
---
Currently we support WoW, Destiny 2, Division 2, Elite Dangerous, Boundless, ARK and Minecraft.
---
\*\*Do you have a website?\*\*
---
4kgaming.org
---
\*\*How do I join?\*\*
---
Go to our site (4kgaming.org). Click Join then click ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù. Also on the main page is our Discord link.
---
\*\*I have more questions\*\*
---
You can contact me directly on Discord at Drasi#1136 or Btag Zaufe#1440.

It seems obvious that they think that you have been given or bought the account from someone in Europe. Unfortunately instead of using logic and explaining that you were in two different physical locations while you were playing you just kept asking what the evidence was, and of course the GM isn‚Äôt going to be able to explain to youÔøº the details of how they determined this. 
---
I understand your frustration, but the behavior pattern is probably identical to someone who bought an account from someone who played in a different geographical location.Ôøº Those people will often try to find out what the evidence is against them so that they can try and explain it away, and they are not going to be given that option by blizzardÔøº. 
---
I recommend that you try another chat and you say to them that you finally understand what their issue is and that you can prove that it was you and you alone who logged in in both Europe and in CanadaÔøº. If you have bills under your exact name and a lease or pay stubsÔøº from both locations, you can offer those as proof.
---
Wait, you did pet the good boy... right?
---
Theres also a lot of players that think you and the rest who act that way are selfish assholes and will spread bad rep about you.
---
But hey, few hundred gold is worth it I guess.
---
I merely shared my opinions on the matter and I've done so in a friendly manner. So I don't understand why you feel the need to throw around insults over this. At the end of the day all I'm doing is looking at value, rather than just the item itself.
---
If you don't play the exact way I think you should, you deserve to be shunned from life.
---
Just so you know how you got caught, they are tracking the HWID from the Eastern European guy that leveled your Account.
---
They either knew from the very first login that it wasn't you playing, or the guy took the next job after yours and they noticed right there and then. Like, do you honestly think your "I was in Europe while leveling and went back to Canada after that." Story would work?
---
You can ask for your money back, or at least get some discount since it's only a temp ban, which you should be content with anyway. You knowingly broke the TOS and you got caught, don't be a sore loser now.
---
lot of people hitting 60 now. Phase 1 is honestly pretty boring for the average player. Most people don't really want to farm exalted with every faction and make every niche PVP trinket.
---
I like the idea of phases, however phase 2 and 3 are so important, Blizzard should be careful not to wait too long to deploy them.
---
The only way this was a ninja loot is if it was agreed upon that everyone else would pass if it dropped. In that case, it should have been a master loot situation.

If I‚Äôm in a dungeon, I don‚Äôt expect ANY tip for my lock picking services. In town, I‚Äôve seen 10 silver-1 gold.
---
Otto Livius
---
I‚Äôve been monitoring my total gold and inventory value (using TSM). On average, my in game ‚Äúworth‚Äù increases around 50-125g per day, as a 60 mage, when playing virtually all day in some cases. 
---
This still feels super slow to me, and I want a more dedicated path to 200+g per day. 
---
Any recommended tactics? I‚Äôm currently 300 herbalism and 300 skinning, AoE farm spec. I‚Äôve done Devilsaur leather but it‚Äôs quite competitive. They‚Äôre selling for 7.5g and I can get 5-7 per hour. So I guess if I just did this all day I might have decent growth, but I want more options for when this is camped/saturated.

This place shows up in my nightmares after bringing a priest through the area.  First time I was introduced to the reality of classic.  Getting my teeth kicked in if I'm not careful.  It's the most fun I've had in WoW in years.
---
Iirc on German servers this was done pretty often. Using + and - i mean. Like for example "You guys up for another run?"

Is this on Herod?

justice comes fast in the plaguelands.....
---
It's perfectly safe, Horde and Ally players have been doing this since the language code was cracked at the end of vanilla
---
why would they suck? if you get +13 in your weapon skill overall which means less misses?
---
&gt;I got one. Currently om Jaedenar EU. Warlock named as My userid, havent played it since TBC really. Probably was on Neptulon back then, dont remember when we moved. One thing that is often overlooked when it comes to vanilla naxx is that initially boss mechanics was not known, it was one of the competitive aspects, who would learn mechanics first and be able to progress. Patchwerk was att that time really frustrating for us initially since there seemed to be no logic to it, tanks just exploded. Once the general idea om how it worked was solved it was quite a challenge to time things right with healing etc. This also means that there were no boss timers mods available, we tried ti live program bosstimers for some bosses due to the actual need for it.  
---
&gt;Deuznak Imbalanced Neptulon EU att that time, 65 om the list (even though we was actually before bad omen on spot 62, our old best competitive guild for server first in Neptulon)

What the fuck is wrong with your brain? I even have a picture of it and i already posted it to the servers discord where it is pinnned in the ninja category.
---
the way i read this: you joined a group, allegations were made against the leader, you believed them.
---
you formed a group, allegations were made against you, now you're mad people believed them.
---
I'm 26 i've farmed Epic mount + darn rep . 12 days played and I have a full time Job and a girlfriend. You're just salty cause you can't commit on anything, game or not. I took 2 weeks to grind ahead of the curve but still I went on a vacation for 1 month before that.
---
Stop justifying tour laziness, you're free to play as you want so am I. That does not mean shit.
---
Different elemental. He's talking the ones in arathi for Cyclonian quest. Earth elemental are in thousand needles IIRC
---
Good question, how *would* he take his own dick?
---
Nah. It's cool. Nice style too.
---
I never seen an issue with didn't have X class its not hard to have 1 of every class in a raiding guild, My raiding guild was small and never had this issue.
---
Are those Ymirs screams?
---
Succubus is my most used pet solo at level 60. She acts basically like an extra powerful dot on the mob. The voidwalker cant really hold any aggro at 60 (most tanks have a hard time actually). I am running SM/Ruin and I CoShadow every mob&gt;corruption&gt;drain life with succy lashing out at him. Mobs just melt. Also, the CC on the succubus is invaluable. Gets that mage to pop iceblock, the rogue to pop Cloak of shadows, causes the undead to pop their racial. Seduce is too powerful.   
---
If you are getting ganked by a mage, pull a felhunter out and the mage will run from you. Seriously, that doggy is badass. If you get polyed, use him to eat the poly, when mage is casting fbolt just interrupt him and its a free kill. Most mages ive faced pvp killed me when i was low hp. As soon as i came back with a felhunter, there was no chance at all for them. My felhunter made many mages ask for layers pls.
---
(yes i have improved drain life. In my opinion its a much better talent then improved CoA, which is like a shit dps increase. improved drain soul i also think is useless if you have high spellpower and improved life tap, you juts life tap to the lowest hp, bandage and get going. I rarely sit to drink.)
---
I guess fishing or AH flipping are the least attention demanding, and won't be affected if you suddenly need to look away
---
A server discord run? Wow how neat.
---
A warrior rolled need. In full compliance with server rules.
---
It's shitty, but the game let's him roll need
---
Like I said, I've been in this exact situation myself. But instead of just complaining about it I decided to adapt and change my perspective on how to look at BoE drops. You can think of it as justifying selfish behavior. But if all you do is complain when this sort of stuff happens you're essentially setting yourself up to be on the losing end of these kinds of situations.
---
The art is great! Just needs a joke.
---
I‚Äôve been hearing a lot of negative things about Vanguard on that server. Not surprised.
---
If you are fast and got your routine you can make up to 50 per hour.
---
Just pick pocket and vendor everything.
---
Alli or Horde? Currently on my server the prices are whack, but back in vanilla "deviat supreme" was a good money maker on Horde side. Also the +mana/sec buff food for endgame raiders.
---
If theyre doing other stuff outside the game its just some passive income while they watch Netflix or something, cant imagine its a huge profit.
---
Ehhh gnomeregan is not a fun dungeon and has never been. Im just saying if you are going there for quests for XP, then there are better ways to get that. Dont downvote me cause you are not aggreeing with me.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest bro, as a warrior tank I judge other warriors hard if they don‚Äôt tank. Especially when they‚Äôre higher levels than me. 
---
You‚Äôre not wrong but I see why people judge as I‚Äôm one of those people. It‚Äôs like if you go into a dungeon with a priest and the priest says he‚Äôs DPS. It‚Äôs very surprising and annoying. Again, not wrong, but I see how others can get annoyed
---
No he doesn‚Äôt.
---
Need is for actual need. As in, equipping an item or learning a pattern etc.
---
For gold you greed.
---
Well I then you don‚Äôt need a punchline :p
---
How many macrosses would one need to fit all this? 3?
---
You're removing armour to help your melee team mates......
---
They had to travel to ironforge and spend 10s to train it, so probably not for convenience
---
I question this bear's true motives.
---
That's cool I'll stick to 1h cuz it works and I don't have issues maintaining threats and it will be an easier transition into content where a shield is required
---
Actually I really like it that way. This way I got a catch up mechanic as my highest Char right now is level 27 and I will probably need at least 2 or 3 more months to leave it to max. So yeah, I love to have those phases.
---
Pro tip: Go to key bindings and set your additional row of action bars to F1-F12.
---
They do. Not nearly as much as others tho. And if guild dont want your minimal contribution then that is their right. Just like other guilds have the right to take you if they want.
---
I find it hard to believe that in a dungeon you maintain a higher dps throughout the dungeon and any other class being a single target damage dealer. With Blade Flurry you can hit two targets occasionally. You may kill a boss 10 sec faster but your dungeon is 10 min slower.
---
42 and I already am planning out my Warlock alt :)
---
He's hotboxing it
---
What do you do, reset until you see the rare?
---
Facts. But lets be real any server talk is almost always Alliance complaining about ratios and whining how its 3 for 1, when most of the server pop data we have is based on smaller sample sizes and doesn't suggest such large discrepancies
---
Honestly you can get them pretty cheap. The first were over a 100g but I got mine for 20.
---
That's part of the fun though.
---
He actually changed his strat to include rotgrip since discovering the bridge method.
---
What UI are you using? I really like the action bar spell boxes with the spacing. Simple but looks great aethsetically.
---
War just roll on the pally gear then. Problem solved. Gotta have that weapon learning and that high spirit
---
Yeah, from what I understand, +Weapon has great value.  Especially against bosses and level 63+ mobs.
---
I'm on Horde so no worries for me as a War
---
Much appreciated :)
---
I dont necessarily want achievments, but stats would be fun to have.
---
Like seeing, total deaths, total gnome kills, BoEs found etc
---
lol that ending
---
"WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? YOU STARTED THIS"
---
that's not how you handle/take world pvp :)
---
Honestly it just seems better to me to go the other way. At that level range im in STV anyway so i just go to swamp of sorrows if i dont have that FP yet and go from there. You might die once or twice but you also get FP in searing gorge and burning steppes
---
The way I usually look at buying gear is ‚Äúwhat will I be able to accomplish with this that I can‚Äôt with my current gear?‚Äù
---
If the answer is nothing I won‚Äôt buy it (while leveling). Gear is replaced so often from drops or quests.
---
This is amazing!
---
Ok the trick is that you just aggro something and then get on the elevator. The mobs cant path on the elevator so they run through the whole fucking dungeon to get to you. I used to farm it at 60.
---
What?
---
No I understand perfectly how you look at this. You however are too simple minded and greed driven to think outside of your materialist box.
---
Good news is the world is run by assholes like you so you‚Äôll be fine, you just won‚Äôt have a soul.
---
I'm very inefficient.
---
Hey it‚Äôs a PVP server you fuck over the other faction and you should feel good about it. And likely those lads will look back and have a laugh about this too once they‚Äôve actually finished the quest
---
Oof baboof...alright #onechange.
---
Thanks yeah, the time is a bummer
---
I entered from river side and just kept resurrecting as close as possible to the grave each time. Probably died like 3-4 times.
---
Ah yeah, I always forget about spirit lol
---
You would play alliance.
---
Are you tanking? If you are just doing dps then no shield and a two hand weapon may be better. I dont have much experience in warrior play. What professions are you doing? If you are a warrior blacksmithing may be a good way to go so you can craft your own gear when needed
---
The world must be a tough place for you
---
GO AWAY ME BUSY
---
That is not how this game or the loot system works though.
---
With your logic, everyone could need on almost everything, because similar equipment is most likely available on the auctionhouse and you can just use the gold you make from vendoring BoP items to buy said gear.
---
Oof, maybe later on, yeah shes not easy as Shamy. not sure if its possible with worse gear. Depends on how clean some1 plays.  
---
But will keep in mind with the Fire Gear, also FNT is extremly expensive Mana Wise
---
&gt;and have a laugh
---
Nope. Anyone who's ever been fucked over on an escort quest does not look back on it fondly. It's happened to me and friends several times while leveling.
---
Yup. When "ruining someone's night" is the highlight I just politely excuse myself these days.
---
I play on a PVE as a rogue and I'm usually running around solo.  Honestly I love it.  It's not the easiest class to play but it's by no means the hardest.
---
Your attacks will miss frequently, but when they do hit, you can do a lot of damage, especially if you've stuck a few points into talents that will increase your chance to crit.
---
Being able to stealth means you can scout out areas before running in and aggroing every nearby mob.
---
Being able to vanish usually works as as a "get out of death free" card if you suddenly find yourself in trouble and aren't feeling up to a corpse run that'll take you across half the zone.
---
Even if you don't spec for subtlety, sap will still allow you to take on situations where there are two or three mobs packed tightly together since you can knock out one and deal with the other(s).
---
Throw has a reasonable range and will allow you to pull mobs out of more dangerous areas so that you can fight them in safe spots.
---
Once you hit 20 and get poisons you can also slow enemies down so if they run away, you aren't at as great a risk of having them dash into a populated area and bringing back 5 other mobs.
---
You can also frequently get to chests and other goodies using stealth that would be time-consuming to acquire if you had to fight your way to them.  That being said, if you see someone else working the immediate area, it's likely that they're also trying to grab that prize.  If that's the case, it's polite to leave it alone, since they're working for it and you're not.  Or, better yet, help them out a bit with the fighting to speed up their progress.  There will be plenty of other fun boxes out there for you to open.
---
Hope this helps.  Have fun!
---
so many people today complain about problems yet they don't stop and think about why the problem exists or if there are solutions that would work
---
This proves it. Everyone who posts on reddit is an alliance mage.
---
This reminds me of MoP when the timeless isle came out and there was a rather difficult to get to chest that dropped very high ilvl gear.  A bunch of my friends and I managed to find a small corner of the area that we could stay out of combat and started charging lots of gold for summons right to the chest.  We got accused of scamming at first but a couple people took their chances then started vouching for us, which made people less hesitant.  Easiest chunk of cash we ever made, and everyone we summoned got their gear.
---
Bookmarking this to see where it leads. I'll upvote on the off-chance you're telling the truth.
---
&gt;Thermaplugg‚Äôs left arm 
---
Ok i'll see if I can get a sword and shield incase
---
First time I went up there the sides were lined with hordes, killing people that even got remotely close.
---
I play Druid cat dps, but almost always get to tank, even if a warrior is in the group. I'm not even that good of a tank, I forget to mark mobs.
---
As someone on a medium pop server which is usually low pop in most of the day until peak hours, no I disagree with this. I used to play on a medium pop server back in 2006 and there is a stark difference between what Ironforge looked like back then even during off-peak hours vs now on peak hours. It's probably a lot do with the fucking layering but it's still not even close.
---
Yeah the music really isn't the problem. Ian Watkins is.
---
I sympathise with you wanting to do the quest, I did too, but I did love the immense trolling and pvp that it produced too.
---
Imo the voidwalker loses value considerably around the 20s. His threat generation is too low so he cant hold aggro. 
---
The succubus provides good damage with limited to mo talent investment. Seduction is very powerful in pvp and if you're taking advantage of the popular drain tanking with dark pact her mana regen is good enough to make her an effective mana battery.
---
Felhunter is good if you're out hunting for pvp action since he just shrugs off magic damage, but for leveling I'd pass.
---
I have had it happen only once (I play on PVE but I‚Äôm usually flagged) with Stinky‚Äôs escort quest in Dustwallow marsh.  Me and 2 mates were doing it and 2 alliance came and jumped us, had a fun little fight and we lost but I look back on it as a fun bit of character building
---
Okay, but could they be good?  As a paladin, being able to tank and DPS competitively at end game would amazing, it would open up the game so much for them.
---
I think we should still be able to all agree that Blizzard should make small changes to make these specs viable. Not change every class and redo the game and change the philosophy etc, but find a way to give paladins a couple more buttons and some mana regen so they can tank raids somewhat well.

---
I don't get what's so hard to understand about this. 
---
Assuming the priest is a tailor, she needed the pattern. The pattern creates one of their best pre raid items. The other guy rolled need on the pattern for "apparently" not him, but a guildie, who's not even in the run. Then we find out he sells it for gold. Not only did he lie he screwed the priest in the group out of her best in slot. 
---
How would that Warrior feel if a plate helmet dropped and the priest needed and disenchanted it because a guildie needed the dust?
---
What makes it even worse is there are so many idiots that don't find anything wrong with this.
---
Conan the Destroyer has its own charm. Arnold is still great in it, Grace Jones &amp; Wilt Chamberlain are fun, but a some of what made the original special is watered down in the name of mass appeal.
---
It's a bit like Cataclysm compared to vanilla.
---
That the exact mentality that caused Blizzard to ruin the game, them thinking it was only about raids and pvp.
---
VERY easy to pull the entire hallway. One second you are doing 5 dwarves like a normal pull, the second later 40 dwarves you pulled from the level below rush you and wipe you.
---
Hug the left wall.
---
So much warrior bully
---
Why.. didn't the rogue kick once? That would have turned the fight so hard lol.
---
Man, I'm just gonna need on everything so I can vendor, with all that money I can buy myself a good item!
---
Some people say I'm greedy but I call myself needy!
---
Love this! Super expressive.
---
&gt; everyone could need on almost everything, 
---
All BOE? Yes, absolutely. They serve no other purpose than increasing your networth.
---
Yeah I just scrolled down and seent it. That's disappointing. :( I have every class at least 85 at this point cept rogue but still. Woulda been nice. Haven't seriously played retail sonce Wrath.
---
Thst could have helped
---
Good ol' OOMkin
---
I disagree on any % of the raid. People are spending hours helping you clear content, they deserve a chance at loot. If you want a loot council don‚Äôt run pugs.
---
Yeah, 40-50 sucks.  Tanaris and Badlands are the only good questing zones and for dungeons you either have Ulda, which is a pain in the ass even with a good group, and ZF, which is rocking the "mage zombie cleave" meta, so while it has good gear, good luck getting a group if you aren't a tank/healer/mage/lock.
---
  And once you find a group, if there is a mage in it there is a good chance that he will be one of the elitist ones that will insult the other DPS, be super demanding about pulls and immediately bounce if things don't go exactly how he wants.
---
  Full Mara clears with a good group are your best bang for the buck on loot and exp but those are pretty rare. 
---
  Once you hit 50 though, you can hit ST a couple times and then be ready for the endgame dungeon grind. But that's another whole ball of wax.
---
Meme specs are as viable as they are well utilized. Our Feral DPS boosts the Fury Warriors DPS a fair bit, and is the quickest dispeller I‚Äôve ever seen. Damage is about 80% what a similarly geared Warrior is but that isn‚Äôt account for the fact that he‚Äôs adding damage to others and freeing up Healers to keep Healing.
---
Mate, this is a game, not real life. You're overreacting like crazy here. I, for one, do not approach real life in a similar fashion to how I approach video games.
---
&gt; and yes rolling need is a safe bet because everyone will, but that doesn‚Äôt make it ok and it doesn‚Äôt justify taking it from someone who needs it because it‚Äôs worth money to them.
---
And this is what I mean with you not understanding the concept of value. That pattern is worth the same to the warrior as it is to the priest. It saves the priest X gold, it earns the warrior X gold. The warrior might put that X gold towards his BIS gear or perhaps towards his epic mount. The X gold the priest saves counts towards similar goals.
---
I think people are taking it a little overboard. What would you blast?
---
&lt;Guild&gt; is scummy and tells people about reserved items after invite and before the boss! 
---
I agree it sound be mentioned in the invite process, but they did tell the tank and I think we need to keep that perspective.
---
It is rough at this point, really rough. They have some kind of policy that, after a case has been appealed and reviewed once, they will not look at any further appeals. So it is very likely that every ticket you open, they will just refer you to the first email they sent and tell you that they will not look at the matter any further. 
---
I think I was past my 10th ticket before one of the customer service representatives actually took some time to look into my case. I had also made a manual claim from any personal information and data they had collected regarding me and my suspension and requested that they released it to me in accordance to the GDPR, but I am not sure if this is what grabbed their attention or not. 
---
I had quite a few hours invested in my journey to get my account unsuspended. If you don't want to sit possibly hours chatting with CS reps, asking for any personal information/data used as grounds for the suspension might be the way to go. They will most likely claim that that particular data and information is "trade secrets" that they don't share. At which point you would have to send the case off to your local authority that deals with violations of the GDPR. 
---
The bottom line is, it is very time consuming and tricky to get your case any more attention at this point, though, based only of the *one* experience I had. If you know that you have done nothing wrong, my best advice is to keep trying. I never tried calling CS, maybe that is an option?
---
Ran it on Monday and same thing happened.  Those dark iron agents can die in a for all I care
---
Agreed. If you play as a retribution paladin you're a selfish asshole.
---
There‚Äôs a lot to unpack here. Wow. 
---
12 days played. Game has been out for a month. That‚Äôs over 9 hours played per day. 
---
Full time job = 40 hours a week / 8 hours a day minus commute. So you‚Äôre literally coming straight home from work every day and spending 9 hours playing wow. That‚Äôs commitment all right. An unhealthy one, but a commitment. 
---
Not sure how you can be proud of that as an adult, or why you‚Äôre acting like you have a girlfriend LUL 
---
Congrats dude, you‚Äôre highly committed to a 15 year old pass-time. Y I K E S

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9030/restorative-potion
---
Human is the best if you want to do high end PvE, for weapon skill/hit and reputation grind. 
---
If It's not in your plans, roll another thing. Even as a PvE player I sometimes miss my first wish to roll Dwarf, there is so many annoying bleeding/poison effects, during leveling and even at 60.
---
&gt; Assuming the priest is a tailor, she needed the pattern. 
---
Only because they're too greedy to buy it and want to tell others they deserve prio for *reasons*
---
&gt;he screwed the priest in the group out of her best in slot.
---
No he didn't, the priest screwed themself out of that when they didn't buy it on the auction house.
---
and what exactly did that have to do with me? since i joined that night and wasnt part of the raid nor am i the one who made that decision?
---
Why people greed on BoE epics is beyond me. I‚Äôve always been of the mind: of a boe epic drops, everyone roll need, because then this situation never happens. Everyone needs gold, and BoE epics are just gold.
---
What level and which pet? Im 32 with succubus drain tanking and I can drag out the drinking/eating part, but every 8 mobs or so I kinda have to.
---
Yeah it doesnt need to be great, a green sword/shield of the whatever animal works. Just keep one in your bags at all times and upgrade as they come along. They also help if you run into a bad situation in the open world and need a shield/shieldwall to escape so have a macro for it.
---
I am Horde, but Hillsbrad is in Eastern, which is the alliance side. Yes my server is balanced, no I wont tell you :)
---
Nice, but if it were me I'd need a 2nd/3rd monitor for Netflix, Twitch and/or YouTube.
---
All you jack wagons saying ‚Äúeveryone needs gold‚Äù explain to me why the gold coin represents greed in the roll window?
---
You Roll need if it‚Äôs going to be used or equipped immidiately. Otherwise you roll greed.
---
As a GM on Pagle this guild is officially on our blacklist.
---
I'm a mage, I don't need uber service.
---
This should be higher up, probably exactly what has happened here.
---
Are you a streamer, facecaming overwatch while playing wow?
---
As a hunter, how much hit am I aiming for for entry-level raiding (I probably wont even do any actual raiding yet, just want to be able to hold my own if I do)?  I won't be getting any hit from spec, at least for a few months as I plan on farming gold at 60 by doing solo princess runs as BM.  
---
On a side note, I just hit level 47 and equipped warmonger (it has +3% hit) and the immediate difference was massive.  I went from missing with auto shots and abilities frequently, to no misses at all on mobs my level or 1 level higher.  It's been common knowledge for 14 years that hit is king until you get it capped, and I plan on buying the devilsaur pieces as soon as I can equip them (53 and 55 I believe).
---
Holy shit looks amazingly comfortable. 
---
Nothing on r/cozyplaces even compares.
---
You are a man of honor
---
Try this:

---
You might have to push the button twice. That is a hard one sadly. Please report back if it worked or not. 
---
Im maining priest this time around so cant test
---
&gt;*AWRAUUUUK*
---
You are one of the best tanks (there are only 3..) you are the best endgame healer (with top 3 at early 60) and you are a pvp beast.
---
Raid dmg is on the weaker side.
---
But you are the best raid SUPPORT.
---
Nightfall and buffs are BIS on retadin..
---
Paladin is viable. I tank easily every dungeon and even ubrs.
---
And as off Tank you are imo #1 even.
---
A big group of monsters is the wet dream of prot paladins.
---
The thing is you don't need prot at all to tank. I use dmg skillung for taking and it works thanks to salvation blessing.
---
Very true. A local hospital actually tests people for tobacco use as part of a hiring process, and we all know that's legal.
---
Fair is fair. The druid was pvp flagged in a horde only zone. Not like for example the redridge escort.
---
Melee Warlock.
---
Tank Hunter.

cool but whats the deal with the tiny corner overwatch
---
Shouldn't be. We're on 1.12.2. In 1.10, Blackrock Spire was lowered from cap of 15 to cap of 10, and BRD, Scholo and Strat were lowered from cap of 10 to cap of 5.

Regardless, even if those new caps aren't in place (I think they are) the powercreep that occurred through vanilla meant those new caps weren't challenges to deal with, so bringing more than 10 to UBRS is pointless even if you can.
---
what unitframe addon is that ?
---
cause he isnt always up and you have to keep resetting to get him?
---
It can't be a journey if *waits in 7500 man queue* it doesn't have a beginning.
---
It's not bad in PvP
---
To all the mages in here, is rotation basically  frostbolt &gt; frostbolt ?
---
Interesting, thanks bud.
---
love your videos dude, they had me rollin! keep um coming!
---
While I agree that is one of the more frustrating parts of classic, I have head-cannoned that it's my skill at extraction/method of defeat that prevented me from harvesting those parts. It only helps a little bit tho...
---
Try Succ with Dark Pact. Pretty sure she has a bigger mana pool as well as less mana intensive spells. Plus the CC.
---
Does that mean fist weapons aren't affected by windfury?
---
we‚Äôre waiting for that second example still...
---
WoW pvp noob here, why should you run sideways? Is it faster?
---
Same here, as a canadian playing NA, never saw a reply with + or -
---
Lmao I work full time plus overtime, have a wife, go to the gym, and do things other than play wow. Yet I‚Äôm still 60 and have my epic mount. Sounds like your pretty inefficient to me.
---
&gt; All you jack wagons saying ‚Äúeveryone needs gold‚Äù explain to me why the gold coin represents greed in the roll window?A
---
Because it uses the same frame as bops?
---
Also as you can see from this screenshot, if he hadn't rolled need the priest would have ninjaed it.
---
Warrior Life
---
Only part not true is the VPN part.
---
They can't actually tell if you are using a VPN or not (unless the ip you connect from is a known ip used by a VPN service).
---
They don't actually ban just because you change ip (they night lock the account if done too often which requires a manual reactivation) as they use a client token as well, so they can see the connection is from the same machine, even if it connects from different locations.
---
Yep, it's the World of Warcraft, not the Campaign of Warcraft 4.
---
he cant. its the only example in existence. garrosh has been bad.
---
You can olt out the other Things, like quest objectives, and just check questgivers for completed or for new quests.
---
You're a retard, but I'm sure you know that.
---
Do you not see the difference between items you can buy and items you can't?
---
Yeah I'm disappointed about it too.  I mean, I'm not going to do anything but create the character and log onto it once, become overwhelmed by binding abilities, then log right back off anyways.  And that would only be while classic was down and BFA was not.  Still, would have been a cool splif.
---
It's generally worth it after 38, which is where Drain Life's DPS at max rank will pretty much always be higher than any wand you can equip
---
Spoiler: she is in the barrens
---
Isn‚Äôt the simple solution to that just to say ‚ÄúDPS WARR LFG SM Monastery‚Äù or whatever in LFG
---
I've going to reverse the question on you. 
---
If I'm tanking why would I get a DPS warrior for my group? I can just get clothies and hunters and roll on both tank and dps gear for myself.
---
Yeah, thing is I did go the Succ a go initially, but i found that she regens mana a lot slower than the imp. The imp regens mana as an astounding rate which is only ever useful if you're multidotting like crazy, which i try to do when questing or if in dungeons of course
---
Absolutely not,  that's literally what ruined retail.
---
Been playing since 05 and I have next to zero interest in either. Some people play the game solely for questing and professions and retail killed that.
---
If I‚Äôm toxic for thinking that the only way to get a tank is to let them reserve loot that everyone else is perfectly willing to roll on them I guess I‚Äôm toxic.
---
If they want to roll on something and compete with everyone else for gear they need, that‚Äôs cool, but the fact that they feel they deserve the loot more than other people then that‚Äôs a toxic attitude to me.
---
The return you get for tanking is being the only one in the group who rolls on tank gear, as well as the right to roll on dps gear. You don‚Äôt get the tank loot and the right to reserve any dps gear you want. That‚Äôs entitlement. The more people are okay with this trash, the more it‚Äôs gonna happen, and it‚Äôs bullshit.
---
Y‚Äôall are seriously missing the point. The Priest would have used it immidiately.
---
Honestly I am thinking there is more context needed. A screenshot of them saying why he rolled would be helpful. It is scummy that he sold it on the AH though.
---
You also have a lot of say in raids/dungeons, even if you're the pug. 
---
I did not go through 60 levels of warrior leveling hell to be someone's bitch.
---
No, even BoP's, because you are only needing on the BoP so you can save gold to not buy similar item from the AH after all.
---
the thing that gets me is people rushing the gearing to the max if classic is going to time frame wise be like vanilla we are looking at a january launch of dire maul that is like 14-15 more weeks of gearing and then like an other 8-10 weeks of dire maul gearing to then finally see BWL.
---
there is time to get BiS gear from everything before BWL no need to go crazy with the reserves.
---
No, just no, as a rogue player for 15 years I can tell you from personal experience and comments a well played rogue is a incredibly value asset for both damage and cc, yes we don't sheep but sap + blind is more then enough (they brake as easy as any other cc and blind costs next to nothing), we also provide one of the best dps (warrior are a joke till late game so idk where u got that from), we can help stop a stray mob killing a healer with in combat cc, kick /gouge spells, vanish into sap, pick locks, kill runners or stop them with crippling  and much more...
---
I just checked the auction house on Firemaw and there are only 3 pages of epics on there, most being recipes. You‚Äôre just really lucky mate.
---
"Gonna need this BoE so I can sell it for gold!"
---
This is not how it works, you need on items you can use and are an upgrade to yourself, you greed on items you intend to sell
---
It's not fucking hard
---
Winter squid are out, agi buff food, good money.
---
You really don't understand how I look at this. It's not even about greed, it's about equal chances. I'm honest about how I approach these kinds of BoE drops. Not only on here, but also in game. I encourage anyone to roll need on BoEs because it makes it so that everyone has an equal shot at it. The reason why I do this is because rolling need is the optimal strategy. Everyone adopting the optimal strategy is the only way to ensure an equal playing field.
---
Expecting people to adopt a sub-optimal strategy is simply naive. Because, as OP perfectly illustrated, some people will choose to adopt the optimal strategy and everyone who was using the sub-optimal strategy loses.
---
get some sleep homie
---
All those alt warriors are gonna have an easy time. I know myself I‚Äôll be doing fiery or lifesteal and all the best gear I can buy and enchantsü§§. Shoot my level 6 shaman has +7 weapon dmg on its staff. I tap mobs to death
---
Alliance. :)
---
Yes, Hypnotic blade can easily carry you into MC. i still have mine
---
Pathetic display from you. Grow up
---
Also always happens when you need 1 more hit to finish the mob off and you're getting lower on health.
---
How do you reach the food when you sit down? Don‚Äôt tell me you *gasp* stand up?!
---
It‚Äôs Best in Slot for Priest. When you craft this, it is BoP only.
---
&gt; The Priest would have used it immidiately.
---
No they wouldn't, they would also have sold it. The money it's worth are clearly more valuable to them than the pattern is, otherwise they would've bought it.
---
For me, I just feel disappointed that I put in these 100s of hours on the game, and now it's just some bloated beast. Holding out hope that they can turn it around. And I have no intention of actually buying BFA this far i to it. New expansion should be like next year right?
---
Uhm, I didn't mean that as a bad thing, but go ahead and be defensive üëç. And no, I've been playing for 15 years...
---
Needing the pattern is perfectly legitimate if loot rules weren't agreed before hand. Plenty of groups apply an all need rule to BoEs, its sensible and safe. 
---
The scummy bit is lieing about what he did with the pattern.
---
To flip this on its head as to why its fine, the accepted standard is that righteous orbs are an all need situation, yet a handful of classes need the orbs, for the rest they only represent financial value. 
---
Yet people are flipping their shit over the recipe but are fine with the orbs when theyre the same thing.
---
Yes? Point being?
---
Oh man were you there? This is exactly what happened! It‚Äôs totally a one off situation that made me have an issue with someone feeling so superior to everyone else that they deserve to get all the tank gear plus any dps gear they want!
---
It‚Äôs a simple request for shit they don‚Äôt deserve. Before you know it the majority of tanks are gonna hold out for loot because all you morons say it‚Äôs okay.
---
Are you unable to tell the difference between literally the same and similar?
---
The item is BiS for a priest you effing wank.
---
They are good tanks with excellent aoe threat. They are very slow compared to a warrior or Druid because they run out of mana so frequently.  They have to drink every other pull.
---
Lol don‚Äôt worry I don‚Äôt group with people who reserve loot for entitled asshats so you won‚Äôt have to worry about grouping with me
---
Because the system says so in the words of the choices. Need the item? Roll need? Don‚Äôt need it but just want it to have it? Greed
---
But this is not the first time people who nicely follow the rules get fucked over
---
hahahaha yeah man that was my exact experience as well.  I would literally spend 15 minutes making stacks of water for people 2 at a time and i'd even explain how long it would take and they'd be like "but i need 3 stacks plz". 
---
As unfortunate as it is, I'm happy to know others have shared the same experience as me.
---
I wish this was enforced better for classic. It's just not the same as vanilla with strict guilds, people don't care if they get "blacklisted". It doesn't do anything.
---
Could be. I have 2 days 12 hours /played. I think that's alot in 30 days. Avarage of 2.5 hrs per day
---
Yet as clearly displayed by this screenshot, the priest was gonna ninja and that's why you roll need.
---
Do you guys think that I will be able to sell a Warden Staff (BiS for feral tanks forever in classic) for more then 300g, the price it is now if I wait longer?
---
Are you unable to tell the difference between NEED and GREED?
---
Yeah, I saw the hs and pot. I was jw what your build looked like because people seem to rave about that demo build that makes us so hard to kill, but I've been trying/building sm-ruin because it's supposed to be so versatile.
---
No you still don't get it. The point is they have no reason to go there, unless someone pays them. I can help guildies or friends, not randoms for absolutely no reason. If I was actually looking to do the dungeon I could easily, as warriors constantly get whispers asking if they wanna tank X dungeon, or if I announce I'm a tank looking for a group it doesn't take long before I get replies.
---
Point being?
---
9% is the absolute minimum, which is the hitcap for specials (sinister strike for example). The white hitcap is like 27%, and most of your damage is white hits.
---
That being said, the yellow hitcap is only 6% if you have 305 or higher weapon skill, which you will if you‚Äôre combat or a human using swords.
---
Or just don't fight mobs higher lvl üòë
---
Priest prolly would've used it. That pattern crafts a bis bp that's bop.
---
So.... It gets better?
---
Truefaith Vestment is a BiS item for Priests for a very long time, check yourself, you're an idiot
---
It's not a waste, it's just not priority #1.
---
9% takes away miss chance for sinister strikes and other yellow attacks.
---
Anything more than 9% only helps white attacks, so it's not worth as much as the first 9%. White attacks are the highest portion of your dps, but crit and attack power actually affect both white and yellow, instead of the hit rating after 9.
---
I was payed 25g. But I had to stay and wait until another summon was needed (I'm not sure why, probably a chain quest, or another person needed it, I can't recall).
---
Not bad considering I watched YT as I waited.
---
Broken Tooth is level 37.
---
Humar is level 24, i believe. OP is likely in his mid-20s.
---
Level up warlocks multiboxing, run some level ones and a single warlock to each location to be the clickers.
---
You do realize tyrs hand archmages dont drop the crusader enchant yet right? That didn't occur until 2.0.1 I think.
---
Yeah, OP got punked
---
What improvements do you mean though? I started in wotlk so never played vanilla. I do miss dual specc and arena. But levling gear, mindless leveling, LFR, transmogs, Garrisons can fuck right off imo.
---
I'm not, however since people are going to ninja (as evident by the priest in the screenshot), it's just safer to all need.
---
Not sure.
---
But as a warlock I can weigh in and say that drain soul awards a soul shard from killing players and the tool-tip says ‚Äúexperience or honour‚Äù
---
So everyone saying that phase 2 needs to be out for the honour part to trigger is incorrect. I relieve no exp or honour from killing players, but I can generate soul shard off players up to 9 levels lower than me.
---
Hope this helps
---
Honestly what's the point? I played classic and retail and I wouldn't suffer the same boring grinds all over.
---
This is even more important when you have a paladin tank. Wait for me to use Consecrate and holy shield. Also, if I skull an enemy, that means only focus this mob, even If I use consecrate I want mobs to attack me so I can get threat from Ret Aura + Blessing of Sanctuary + Holy Shield.
---
Agreed.
---
Hahahahahaha. If you don‚Äôt approach life this way I‚Äôm a fucking astronaut. This is a way of thinking, buddy. And social games mimic what we would really be in real life if real life social stigma didn‚Äôt prevent us from living it out. I guarantee that this is how you approach value in your real life even if you aren‚Äôt aware of it.
---
I understand exactly what you‚Äôre talking about and what your concept of value is. Spending gold on a product or item that is already available is entirely different than a rare or limited resource that someone is actively hunting and will draw value from directly.
---
You‚Äôre dog whistling so hard and I‚Äôm done talking to you.
---
It‚Äôs a miracle. Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind
---
It sucks for everyone if your not a tank/healer to find a group my dude.
---
You are misremembering, this stuff definitely happened.
---
Yes and it's also a boe recipe and as such they would have it if they cared more about it than the money.
---
lol just be rich right
---
Two words.
---
Dreadforge 
---
Retaliator
---
Hmm, Haden‚Äôt thought about that
---
As alliance, I asked Ashenvale general chat about questing in Stonetalon (you know the early-mid 20s part for alliance). One grizzled soul told me if I'm going to go there to "bring a pillow to bite down on"
---
Wait people expect to be paid to open chests and shit in pugs? As a day 1 rogue I've never charged for that shit. Fuck people
---
&gt; Long-term high pop servers will get better
---
Faerlina is the exception here. Its going to be absolutely backed until the big streamers quit, then it will be a ghost town server.
---
So they want priority on an "expensive as fuck" item and that doesn't seem greedy to you?
---
Yeah you‚Äôre nowhere near the point where hit is ‚Äúbad‚Äù yet.
---
Lol you think too small. They buy out an entire item then sell it.
---
Why do you think McDonalds sells burgers for $1? Because they don‚Äôt need to make top margin for each burger like a $8 burger from Five Guys. They‚Äôre gonna feed 68 million people today. 
---
If I‚Äôm missing your point, and it‚Äôs someone small just listing a single item for 50% of the cost, then I still think you‚Äôre thinking to small. Buy the it and sell it yourself for double the price if you think it‚Äôll sell.
---
Otherwise, why do you care what another player lists their stuff for?
---
You have the right to refuse them. You have to realize the tank in question has probably ran that dungeon several times, and he's tired of losing the item he wants. Or there is no more loot for him inside so he asks for gold as compensation because at that point its work. And were talking about my free time here. I have better things to do than running randoms through a dungeon when there's nothing in it for me.
---
Dunked it
---
This is how we old folks did back in the day before all these fancy lfg tools we actually had to have a community that interacted with each other beyond just telling people they arent good enough to play
---
I expect this will get downvoted, but I'll explain the logic behind needing on something that's BoE. Truefaith Vestments are best in slot for priests. Assume you can buy them on the auction house for 300g. If they drop in a dungeon, they are not yet bound to anybody. So they might as well not be the pattern for Truefaith Vestments at all. Essentially 300g has just dropped. The fact that the priest can use them is irrelevant. It sells for the same price, regardless of your class. If the warrior wins the roll and sells them on the auction house, he can use that money to buy a best-in-slot item for himself. So by winning the roll on an item, the Warrior has obtained a best in slot item. So when an item drops that is trade-able, it might as well be a best-in-slot item for everyone. Even if the priest wins the roll, the fact that they *could have* sold the pattern for 300g, means they lost 300g by learning it. The pattern is worth the same amount of money to everyone who rolls on it, so the pattern is fair game.
---
Just another reason retail&gt;classic. We dealt with this, we begged for it to be fixed, and it got fixed.   
---
Quit playing in the dark ages. Do you bathe in piss too?
---
what do you expect from a guild named John Deere, lmao.
---
your friend isn't even a tailor, she deserves to be sad
---
Don‚Äôt trust someone on/over the internet until they show you something that validates them. He had red flags from the beginning when he asked could he run it again after he got what he needed and then begged. I would have just ignored him straight from that point. At the end of the day you learned a 3 stack of runecloth lesson. I wouldn‚Äôt even pm him, just walk away
---
As another holy priest I feel her pain, kinda why I‚Äôm trying to get guild groups for stratt live.
---
What the fuck is this mental gymnastics?
---
They want the recipe, but not to make their BIS item?
---
THEY CAN'T BUY THE CRAFTED ITEM, **CRAFTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT**
---
So I just crafted the full shadowweave set. Does that mean that my shadow damage dots should now be ticking for their base damage + the damage the set gives? Sorry if the question is nooby I've never played wow before.
---
No-no, you go in as a hunter, jump down without dismissing your pet who proceeds to aggro half the dungeon. After that you FD and act surprised as hordes of troggs gangbagg your healer.
---
There is mooncloth bag (16bag)
---
Find a feral druid tank friend - then there isn't much shared loot. 
---
You're expected to tank because it's so hard to find a tank - and of course because in a lot of cases, a DPS warrior has some experience with tanking and can do it just fine in DPS spec. So people probably don't think it's much to ask for. 
---
As a lot of people pointed out, it's hard to find warrior tanks that want to bring warrior DPS, there is so much demand for them that they can pick and choose. 
---
That being said, for raids you should have no problem at all, you're the top DPS for many encounters,
---
And sit bottom of the dps charts so your guild decides to not give you loot because you didn't put your effort In to contribute to the guilds success while everyone else is trying to pull their own weight and make the initial runs go smooth. Loot is scarce in classic you dont just get free shit for showing up, you need to contribute.
---
There‚Äôs no way in hell you would ever using phytoskin over truestrike. Truestrike could have 1% less hit and it would still be better.
---
1agi is only 1ap (and some crit) for rogues.
---
but what about heartseeker being a dead server??
---
Go AWAY im Baitin
---
Ah. That explains why I haven‚Äôt seen any humans on mechanostriders. Ty for the info!
---
&gt; Making gold is not a priority to a lot of people in this game. 
---
Then why would they would they want priority rolling on items that is literally only gold?
---
Heroic strike and cleave also eat up your next normal autoattack so you have to be careful about using it since it costs rage + you lose the rage generation. If you can't use BT and whirlwind on cooldown from a lack of rage, you're doing it wrong and need to re-evaluation your rage management.

IM NEED ROLLING DAL RENDS ON MY MAGE BECAUSE WINNING ISNT NINJA‚ÄôING
---
What if they don't have the money?
---
I honestly think this is partly because we're all older now. Back then when we were young teenagers, like 13 and 14, we enjoyed the game slowly. We did fun stuff like raiding, and helping other people. 
---
Now that we're all older, at least my guild, we're all above late 20s, people with family and jobs. No one has time to "help" others and go on raids. They're here for their benefit, and gone when they're done. 
---
It's sad. Lol.

I made my human as ugly as possible in my little protest because my friends rolled alliance when I wanted horde. I was sad when I learned my bald priest will forever stay bald. Both tier 1 and tier 2 shows my bald head too!
---
&gt; They want the recipe, but not to make their BIS item?
---
If they wanted to craft the item, they would have already as I said 5 times already in this thread, literally nothing is preventing them from doing it, yet they choose not to.
---
&gt; THEY CAN'T BUY THE CRAFTED ITEM, CRAFTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT
---
THEY CAN BUY THE RECIPE?
---
Found Vanguard's GM.
---
Yeah, I'm lvl 25 right now. I will probably try to get Broken Tooth once, but at least until that, I will enjoy the company of Humar. He is at least unique at his look (and really cool!)
---
Rolling need on an item you don't need is pretty much the definition of ninja looting, dude
---
You could try reporting him. I doubt they will ban him but couldnt hurt to try.  Make sure the server knows he cant be trusted.
---
Just camps that are farmed. Satyr camps in Azshara and Felwood, Timbermaw rep in Feldwood and Winterspring, elites in EPL, Elementals in Silithus, Felwood.. This kind of spots are always crowdy.
---
This semantics. The item was ACTUALLY needed by the person that could use it in its raw state. Your bringing a level of economics into this that makes me wonder how you enjoy the game. Ultimately we wanted classic because it restored the need for in game relationships and doing right by other people. Your idea is that we should eff them all and look out for number 1. That attitude has no place in the Classic I want to play.
---
"But if i got it then i could become a tailor...." Like seriously, yeah its good gear but if you cant make then what is she going to do with it? Give it to friend who can? Sit on it? Im at lvl 29 and already just over halfway to being able to make it by using my own mats from multiple toons.
---
How do you fuck up as a ret?

Forget auto attacking? :D
---
If BoE drops were meant to be only needed because of their gold value, then there wouldn't be a greed button implemented for them. 
---
This is the indication of how system was designed to be followed by the developers.
---
You need it, upgrade, crafting? Need it.
---
You're going to sell it? Greed it.
---
With the properetiary rules created by ninjas this greed button is left out with no function, obviously devs wouldn't add a button with no function just for the sake of it, if they wanted us to follow the "need every BoE" then we'd get only a roll option and pass option.
---
Maybe i Just want fast clear times because i want to do other things in the game or RL. 
---
Maybe i dont want this meme spec to roll on my Pvp Gear. 
---
Maybe i wont pay 100g for respec because this other guy doesnt.
---
Like OP Said its your choice. But you are actually being carried.
---
If they can't afford the pattern, they can't afford to learn the pattern.
---
It is not gold until it it sold. Why would they want to spend gold on an item they can make?
---
I Crit My Pants

Is this horde or ally? I'm on blow me and with every trip I make to Tanaris I want to blow my brains out.
---
Whats the special of Humar? I tamed The Rake in mulgore, that is quite low level too with attack speed of 1.2
---
Love the armour!
---
They can't craft the item because they don't have the recipe.
---
They can't buy the recipe because who fucking knows, it's the recipe for a BiS item that is expensive enough to ninja loot, so it probably costs a fuckload
---
A journey always begins with the first step young one
---
Nop, I think only his look. (His attack speed is 1.3, so not really special)
---
And every dps has run the dungeon 100 times as well looking for the gear.
---
This is exactly the attitude I have an issue with. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù
---
The chance to roll against the others who need it is in it for you, just like everyone else. If you think you‚Äôre entitled to it before anyone else because of your role, then you have the kind of shit attitude that I‚Äôm talking about. 
---
It‚Äôs not just your free time, it‚Äôs everyone else‚Äôs too. You think that dps who has a hard time finding a group and gets maybe 1 every couple hours of spamming lfg for that dungeon should have less of a chance than the tank who can literally run it as often as he wants because the dps time is somehow less valuable or something?
---
How is that okay?
---
Score!
---
Hey! Which addon are you using for castbars?
---
Oh. No. Another blacklist for the massive servers that are four times the size of original servers. Whatever will they do??
---
/s

Seriously though, we need a solution to this that will actually do something. Blacklists in Classic have no meaning.

I switched to shaman and found it's so much fun to play. Never thought it would be this much fun. I like how dynamic the playstyle can be and how versatile they are. Especially with builds that allow tanking in dungeons, that blew my mind.
---
Nah, there is no reason for people to do the runs if they have no chance at loot. It was a minor problem in vanilla. Just have to keep at blacklisting people who do this. It's as much on you to decline going to runs where people reserve things.
---
That is an incredible amount of assumptions. Just because you want something doesn't mean you're going to buy it... If he doesn't have the money for that recipe but really wants it so he can make himself the staff?
---
If you got gifted a car and don't sell it, does that mean you would have bought the car? No, cause you might not be willing to spend that much money on a car.. but it also doesn't mean you're definitely going to sell it
---
You're being ridiculous and I hope I'm falling for a troll
---
&gt; It is not gold until it it sold.
---
Networth then.
---
&gt; Why would they want to spend gold on an item they can make?
---
Because it costs them the same either way? So the question is, why wouldn't they spend the gold and do it right away?
---
Name and shame him.
---
Wasn't expecting a 12 year old move from the community on this game has been flawless so far. I guess there's a douche-bag lurking around every corner though.
---
See how it‚Äôs a boe dal rends is not think you need to re read my points above. Rolling need on a boe and winning the roll is not ninja‚Äôing
---
Add a WF Totem for maximum effect
---
I'm convinced you're in the guild from the post at this point, nobody else could defend such a shitty action so blindly
---
Someone‚Äôs mad their version of the game is dead
---
Additionally posting my other comment:
---
That dude murdered me when I was there last week. Many areas of the game seem to have Horde dudes walking around &gt;_&lt;
---
&gt;  The item was ACTUALLY needed by the person that could use it in its raw state.
---
The priest doesn't need it when he can buy on the auction house.
---
There's a difference between helping a guildy with a quick favor and solving all of their problems at your expense. This has happened to me enough times that I just started saying "sorry, I'm busy" or "I don't have any extra materials, sorry" to newer members.
---
The version that is dead is the entire game.
---
Humar is 1.3; unless you're super hardcore about PvP there's not much reason to camp BT once you've got him or The Rake. No need for two cats in your Classic stable.
---
Get yourself a bow/gun/crossbow and youll learn to tactically pull single mobs into safe areas. Im rogue so its similar, always keep ammo so i can do some sneaky pulls outta crazy populated areas
---
No, you do not seem to understand, or are willfully misunderstanding. If a group is asking for more people for a party where certain items are reserved, they are informing you beforehand that &lt;item&gt; is reserved. This is fine. You are aware of the conditions when you join this party.
---
It's only ninja-looting when the partyleader changes the looting rules to masterlooter just before a pull, without informing the people unaware of the reserved items.
---
As long as it's communicated that certain items are going to a specific person, it's fine. I mean, yea, I won't join that group, fuck those people, but ethically/morally, there's nothing wrong there.
---
So we also all roll need on boe greens right?
---
This is what happens to me on my lock every time. Kill 5+ ally while questing then suddenly a raid group spanks me.
---
I‚Äôm not a priest so I‚Äôm not sure, but I‚Äôve been told guides say not to do tailoring unless you get this pattern. She has all of the mats for min/maxing and for the pattern.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Yesterday was the first time I played in retail since Classic came out, I wanna play the last part of the war campaign.  I think the sense of accomplishment I had in retail is gone now, until new content is released. So I'll be mostly sticking to Classic for the near future.
---
Here's the policy, just for kicks:
---
https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/2563
---
relevant flair
---
yes but when I joined allegations were made in the party chat only not spamming the world chat
---
low effort SpongeBob meme.
---
I can see BGs giving a nice streaming boost again (and therefore a potential surge in popularity), they shouldn't wait too long with that
---
Nobody cares about gear except on their own character. Nobody is going to look at gear for raid invites for a few months
---
I love classic in its state, but that pat on the ass I've gotten used to when achieving things from gaining a skill to falling nearly to my death is oh, so sweet.
---
It could be a year, that‚Äôs a lot of time ramless
---
Regular items? Yes definitly. Patterns that creates an item that is BoP? Hell no. Profession &gt; Greed.
---
As a warlock I didn't have this problem. But with minor AH use, and taking the most valuable quest rewards when no upgrade was available, and vendoring a lot I had just around 100g at 40. The earlier you can get larger bags the better. You can grind out quests and such longer, making more efficient hold gains from vendor trash. It's also not worth buying any and all skills right away. Since you don't really use them all, they are not worth it.
---
I see people ganking there all the time and guards pay 0 attention.
---
You know, my issue is that the class fantasy doesn't fit at all for paladins and I'm maining a Shaman. Resto shaman, okay that kind of makes sense because they are more caster oriented. Resto druid? That fits the class fantasy really well. Paladins in dresses spamming heals? Doesn't make sense at all. Even the class selection tooltip says **holy warrior**, which implies you aren't sitting in a corner with a pink dress, spamming 5min buffs and healing the main tank who actually is in the front line
---
I feel like im missing something here. He had the higher roll and won the loot. That is not ninja'ing, correct?
---
Alt trains the pattern and makes the item for the Priest. It‚Äôs realy that simple.
---
I don't know what I am looking at, that picture looks like what the thoughts of an alzheimer's patient would look like.
---
The problem with this logic is that Pugs in WoW have since Day 1 been wild-west. You are agreeing to go along on an adventure with people you do not know. In D&amp;D under such a circumstance, would you allow basically an NPC to decide how loot is distributed? That is what WoW is when the RL is someone you do not know. You are basically adventuring with mercenaries.
---
u
---
He'll probably come back to the guild if you ask nicely and make a donation.  Likely, he left because another guild offered to run him through that first rfk boss while you logged out.
---
Queues are mostly Faerlina.
---
I created a Code of Honor for my guild just for this reason. THIS is how PvP should be done. It's something fun and enjoyable for both parties, and nobody leaves feeling bad. Too many people get lost in their emotions and it spreads negativity and toxicity. 
---
This is especially bad on my server (Heartseeker) as horde because our pop is like 10:1 in favor of ally in 40+ areas. Our server became a refuge server for outnumbered ally on other servers apparently, so they all have nothing but vengeance on the mind at all times. It's made the server not very enjoyable for a majority of the population.
---
One person undercuts far below typical price.. And then 50 other people follow suit at that price, then someone once again cuts 50%.. Now the items I spent time farming or whatever havr become worth copper instead of gold because the ah is an unstable joke of retail kids throwing shit on with addons set to undercut for guaranteed sales.
---
Then you get the merchants dropping 600 items instead of the 10 stacks to fill 500 pages that no one is going to leaf through to find reasonably priced items. 
---
Cant wait for the retail kids to get bored
---
Oh wow. Wish I discovered that 20 levels ago!
---
He prob has 2 account his main one he plays and then there the one with alt that he log in and out off
---
That‚Äôs kind of hard to do with stealth classes. Like yeah you might kill him but he can Rez and instantly go stealth, and wait for you to have a mob or two on you then it‚Äôs him dominating the spot.  Cheap tactics win over skill or power.
---
That's ridiculous. Scamming is part of the game
---
Exactly. I love how he says "it's the first one he thought of" like there are more. Te only evidence people have of Garrosh being a good guy was a miscommunication from the writers.
---
I also have seen companies mess things like this up. I used to play runescape 3 a few years ago and I stopped playing for awhile. When I went back it was clear my account had been compromised since my password had changed. When I was able to eventually log on I saw my account had been banned for macroing. I guess the people who hacked my account used my leveled skills to bot and make money. Unfortunately Jagex has an absolute no ban reversing policy, but I really didn‚Äôt care.
---
As someone who works as a software engineer and occasionally as devops it would be pretty easy to tell if an account is compromised. Companies do make mistakes, and in this case I think their bot detector activated and banned the account before they determined it was a compromised account.
---
&gt; because in your mind there's no reality where people farm for things rather than buy them on the auction house. 
---
There is such a reality, however doing so is irrational and you should not reward irrational people by giving them preferential treatment.
---
Would you trade me all your runecloth because I prefer to grind for my bandages?
---
Ah yes, setting challenges for yourself in a game that‚Äôs effectively a sandbox, the most abominable of crimes
---
HEY! Don't you talk to her like that!
---
[deleted]
---
Yikes on you, trying to justify yourself by any mean literrally shitting on everyone that's not like you.
---
I just said I took 2 weeks off to be able to grind. I played 12-14 hours daily during this time, me and my gf had an agrement about this, it was planned since the anouncement but you did your math completely wrong just to prove your point.  I don't even want to justify myself to a scrub like you. Return to your exciting Reddit life lol. Pretty sure you still live with your mom also.
---
Priest was not a tailor so ...
---
The fact that they lied about it means tgat they too considered it scummy. Scummy enough to cover up.
---
Yeah, just 20 silver. Why even demand payment.
---
You're the real hero!
---
Yep that‚Äôs what I wanted to play! :) I‚Äôve also thought about going pyroclasm to bomb things with the mage. But I think this is just better.
---
The skill thing is definitely a huge difference between how I play Classic compared to Vanilla. It‚Äôs really easy to blow a pretty large amount of gold on skills you barely ever use, especially when leveling.
---
Bks nuggets are horrid. Wendy's is crunchier than McDonalds and imo opinion better, but the key is getting them made fresh.
---
hey i got that but sometimes it dont work lol i still get sent to the shadow realm
---
Is it a bunch of guys or one guy multiboxing? Or a bunch of guys multiboxing?
---
I had 80g at level 40 so I sold a ring to my friend for 60g
---
After the blind, SS into gouge and then Elvis, druid had 200 HP.
---
Thank-you captain pedantic.
---
think i should steam roll with a mage first? (new player) then come back and fully gear my warrior ?
---
It should be, I genuinely believe games become better when scamming is allowed yet provide you the tools needed to avoid it.
---
That's ridiculous. Scamming should be allowed
---
He runs to the area right before the abomination room. You‚Äôll see and kill him if you do a baron run.
---
What spec do u tank as? I enjoy tanking but its getting harder (at brd now)
---
No, I am talking about vendoring that shit right before your eyes and it being BoP.
---
Because that is how stupid your logic on this issue is.
---
I don't think so, I just saw him doing it on stream the other day. I'll try to find another YouTube guide for it when I get home
---
The stunaoe pairs well in aoe dungeon groups alongside mages though.
---
Presumably three of those are tanks right? So 7 DPS. He Shouldn‚Äôt have much problem finding a raid then
---
How do you know that
---
Let's re-word it then...the Multiboxer pays nothing and Blizzard made the money before it ever got into the boxer's hands, as it wasn't bought with the express purpose of going to multiboxers.
---
Well we tauren can still ride the black war raptor
---
I don‚Äôt know. You tell me
---
Neither of these people should have rolled need on this.
---
She isn't a tailor, and you shouldn't be "rolling for a guildie" 
---
Bunch of nonsense
---
all i can afford im super poor
---
&gt;ll
---
Yea fuck that priest. He/she isnt a tailor. Everyone should have rolled need then. My "ALT" is w.e I want him to be because ya know GOLLD

---
Can we retake this pic I think I blinked
---
So they should have left the item on the Boss? The more OP adds, the more this sounds like a guy who lost a game having it out at the bar.
---
You just ended this man's whole career
---
This.  And as soon as you make the robe you drop tailoring for something else.  The robe is good enough to justify training tailoring to 300 just to craft it.
---
No, because the logic doesn't apply to BOP items, when you cannot buy an item it represents something that isn't money to the person who has it, not so with items you can buy.
---
How do I mute the general chat channel? 
---
Barrens chat gets to be too much sometimes and I didn't see a relevant add-on from [this beautiful thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d86rs0/my_list_of_recommended_addons_that_will_improve/) the other day.
---
Jesus, I think best of 5 would‚Äôve sufficed.
---
Yeah, once you get Mortal Strike, other things do the dying.
---
It was like this back in vanilla. The alliance constantly bitched that the paladin was too weak, and the Shaman was OP. So, Blizard buffed the pally to be even more OP, and nerfed the shammy into the ground.
---
They only realized their mistake when TBC came out.
---
In theory it could also be 3 people,each with  8 characters logging in and out. Not sure though .
---
Yes, they were, in 2.4.3. I wouldn't know if it was 40 before that patch though.
---
Next you're going to tell me there's a dragon primal inside who will end the world and let Blizz make World of Warcraft: A Realm Reborn
---
Yes if the tank needs loot and refuses to run unless he gets gold, it‚Äôs a problem.
---
If a tank doesn‚Äôt need anything and is running strictly to help you out, then he deserves compensation
---
I mean there are no BOP crafting mats for tailors so I think a pattern being for an account is fine
---
It's been your experience that everyone needs on every halfway sellable green drop?
---
Back when I played vanilla, I didn‚Äôt get my mount until about level 48, and it took me months just to get there.
---
This time, I around, I had 100g at level 34 and didn‚Äôt really have to slow down my leveling to get it. All I had to do was stop by a Stonescale Eel pool or Floating Wreckage while questing in STV and I made it in no time. Of course knowing what abilities I needed and what I could skip was a massive help in saving gold too.
---
I was just like "wow I can't believe I have never heard of that extension, I'ma get that right meow" and then I was like...wait....I have 2 monitors lol.
---
https://images.app.goo.gl/619EXk44dufXHg6L7
---
Ive been in your shoes before, i hate people like this too.
---
If you need them for something else then you roll on them too? Not too hard to figure out really
---
Technically speaking hacking, botnets, and spoofed info are all very real actions all of which are not your fault and they legally cannot punish you for an action not your fault if you can prove 1 of these events took place the ban becomes a liability on there end.
---
Race? Pfft, you just *buy* your way to max.
---
Healer, definitely.
---
I‚Äôm a level 37 rogue and am still around 50g away from my mount. Is the SM Library pickpocket farming a viable option to get that gold, or at least help a little?
---
And even more context, this pattern is for a BoP chest piece. That means it doesn't matter what profession the guys alt is. You can't use the pattern on an alt to create the piece for your main. IMO, everyone should have rolled need on this because no one in the party was going to use it. I think the guild to avoid here is OPs. His loot rules are bad, and he's defending someone who doesn't have an argument for why they should have received an item.
---
20s can be a lot for someone, especially if they're poked constantly for portals. It adds up.
---
With blood and honour
---
I always think of it like this... 
---
Retail has better gameplay. Classes have more to do these days than stick to a 1-2 button rotation. There is more content, and difficulty in dungeons that range from easy as shit, to almost impossible. 
---
The downsides to Retail are the social aspects, you don't really have to talk even in LFG/LFR at all, there is no sense of server community anymore. The world doesn't feel dangerous.
---
However with Classic, you get the old world back. You get what feels like more of an RPG, you get the sense of community and those social aspects back. Getting gear, items, mounts feels like achievements. 
---
The downsides for Classic, classes are very simple, the only viable builds will be cookie cutter. The dungeons and raids are extremely easy compared to what Retail can offer. Also for those of us who work or go to school, we can't play like we used to 15yrs ago, that's not a gripe with the game itself, just how MMO's have changed over the years.
---
Either way, I love both of them... I just hope Retail gets a great expansion after BFA.
---
First of all, it's a game - take it down a few notches. Secondly, rolling on something that will sell for a lot is not un-empathetic to someone who needs it. On the contrary, saying you have a claim to it because it's good for you, despite the fact that it could mean someone else in the group might acquire a BiS item is extremely selfish.
---
Hunter weapon
---
&gt;dont just get free shit for showing up
---
Unless you're a druid, or a hunter, or the one warlock in my guild, or literally any other class and you're in a pug that does /roll
---
Nobody is kicked for doing suboptimal dps, because what the fuck is suboptimal?
---
I definitely didn't because I spent all that cloth levelling tailoring and turning it into trash.
---
I suspect if I did something like skinning instead I would have made it.
---
Heroic strike more and you‚Äôre u won‚Äôt get all those misses. Also, BT has better DPR thank Execute.
---
They have dash though, which is pretty nice
---
I would say that‚Äôs fine as long as you are healing which you can totally do as enhancement leveling up. Now if you‚Äôre dpsing and rolling on healing gear against the healer in the group, that‚Äôs not ok in my book
---
clicker
---
The Bloodlust issue was self-inflicted. They could have just nerfed Bloodlust a bit instead.
---
And he learned his lesson. Backed off and continued questing. Him trying to dominate and continue killing will just slow his questing down for no real reason.
---
Because it's now known that the priest is not a tailor.
---
Removed for Rule #3, witch-hunting. Gotta blur names at a minimum.
---
Not gonna lie, upon hitting 60 I had the urge to level up my alt right away. It felt more interesting than the prebis/gold/consumables grind that you do at 60 in phase 1. 
---
Funny, too, since when I was a teenager playing this game in 2005 I DESPISED questing and leveling. It took me ages to complete and I spent most of my time PVPing. Now as an adult I really enjoy it.
---
Why should blizz fix a problem that is up to the players?  If you ever had any concern about being ganked by the other faction, being outnumbered on a PVP server, or not being able to quest because of world pvp you should have rolled PVE.  Simple.
---
its a small crew of guys, he had to increase prices after a week cause one of them left to go fishing cause he wasnt getting paid enough.
---
I can agree on that, but I think that rules for the dungeon should always be talked about openly. If a guild is looking for an item, make it known to everyone. This idea that there are solid loot rolling ideals is kind of going down the drain. The best way to figure it out is communicate with those you are in the pug with.
---
Immolate is not mana efficient, but it has decent DPS, and does its damage faster than corruption or CoA. If mobs are dying too fast for immolate then you shouldn‚Äôt be dotting much at all
---
I always wait to see if others greed, then I greed if they do. If a single person needs, I need.
---
Ayyyy whattup &lt;Yang Gang&gt; I too am on Incendius and have done stuff with your guild a bunch.
---
IRL shortarse, I sympathise with their plight.
---
What are the rules about epic boe dungeon loot?
---
Dropped an epic in dung and I rolled need because it was a flurry axe and as a warrior that is a nice weapon that I actually started using, rest of the group tho said they will need-roll it too since I rolled need already. To my surprise I won it but it made me wonder about the general rules about this as im not entirely sure myself
---
Incendius represent!
---
Yeah, but so do cats, and bores have charge.
---
Im using auctioneer for exactly that even though the ah scans take ages
---
I want Asmongold to see this
---
just type that in the chat
---
It's not that it's not possible, it's just clearly second tier, mostly in raids (might be the best aoe tank for dungeons, or some trash mob OT).  Pally tanks will take more dmg, have fewer tools for staying alive, have no taunt, and poor threat generation.

"The mage and me" sounds like an emotionally heartwarming film that was nominated for awards but just slightly lost out to "Blackrock mountain". A tale of forbidden love between cow and dwarf.

In general terms I agree, but I‚Äôm also on a server where it was fairly balanced early on, but a decent portion of alliance server transferred because the horde were so aggressive. Now the balance is pretty off.

I am also interested in these specifics!
---
Hey buy low and sell high is key of making real gold 
---
You can make 20silver per stack but guess what 4 stacks = 1gold profit cover time it will add up. 
---
I myself keep an eye on the cloth mats I had 10g by lvl15 just off the low linen cloth
---
There's more than 16 hours in a day tho
---
How much do large brilliant shards selling for on your server? I got drunk last night and bought a stack with my mount money thinking I was going to make a fortune reselling.
---
90% of the population is leveling. Prices are gonna be shit until people hit max level and just chill.
---
You have a hard time believing that someone would sponsor one of the most viewed streamers?

Well on pservers i had an ukranian friend. I remember alot of hate towards each other (probably just player hating)

But most of the time he acted as if he was ru when in dungeons to avoid comments.

I really want to play a Gnome again but i wonder if i am screwing myself over in the long run for raids?

STV was pretty chill in my experience

Arathi on the other hand was a bloody warzone where small ganks would turn into raid fights between Tarren Mill and Southshore
---
Tsm does it. I don‚Äôt know about any others.
---
I had 100g at 40. Used the AH to sell basically everything but greys, helped me make a significant bit of extra gold over the course of leveling to 40.

Skinning for the win!

I did the quest a week ago, just swim up the river and take 1 death

I was always curious how that server is. It makes sense for it to be brutal since if you are role playing your true characters would probably not show mercy.
---
Alliance kill on sight in STV. 
---
Meanwhile in Desolace and Duskwallow Marsh they run by waving hello and even helping kill mobs now and then.

Ah thought you were OP, but ty for sharing!

You have to scam thousands of gold before they care.

Hello friends, I've re-visited my first upload which goes over how to solo Mara as a Druid.

There were some significant differences on private servers which meant that the old video is kind of not valid any more.

Hopefully this can help some people out! :)

LoL?  What game were you playing where naxx is easier than retail LFR?  I call you never seen vanilla ever or naxx here. Is it even up yet?

Right-click it and toggle lock window off, move it, lock it again

stuff like AV or world raids

My guild has done this very thing with the fine gentleman over at Uber, it's deluxe!

I'm pretty sure that's a wrath thing but I don't want to look it up
---
Keep play as you whish...  And I have no illusion about the Equip rolling everybody who sees a better item then currently equipped is allowed to roll.  
---
I would not discuss  much just advertise yourself as DD.
---
I'm warrior and every skill costs double that what I have right now. So... no.
---
You‚Äôll have to forgive me, I guess I never really paid attention to hit that much. I played warrior but was late to vanilla only was at 51 when BC dropped. So +7 to one of those weapon skills would be better than something with str agi and Stam?
---
But is that the most important step?
---
haha my server doesn't even have arcanite bars on the auction house yet T_T
---
There is a set translation. It's not random. But it only has a few options. And they depend on which side you're on.
---
I think almost everything is going to get more expensive. The gold supply in the game is really low right now, the game has only been out for a month. There aren't enough gold sinks in the game to offset the gold that players get by simply playing the game. Further, demand at the top levels is still pretty low - most players aren't level 60 yet. In a few months when everyone starts hitting 60 demand for endgame gear is going to skyrocket. IMO unless you need liquidity for buying a mount, I'd be holding onto everything I can as raw materials for now.

They were removed when we no longer needed arrows in wrath

Meh, the problem was exacerbated by allowing the under represented faction to free transfer to another more balanced realm.

Yeah it‚Äôs not 1-1 and is complicated, but is it possible to discover some more translations by messing with it more?
---
maybe I want my combo points to die
---
Yes but how do I get a group for those going, I tried asking in badlands and got no replies. Is there a name for that kind of run?
---
If you farm something low enough level that you can autoattack and kill, you can make some gold selling greys or farming cloth and if you need to tab away your character can dispatch your current mob via autoattack as long as you're facing the right way.
---
I've been semi-afk farming green mobs at work and making a decent amount of gph even though I occasionally tab out.
---
The rogue pvp spec does get prep and cold blood. You can go premed, but most people go for CB.
---
It's great!!
---
My guild will hire them to summon on quest routes we run like Hydraxian Waterlords or Ony attunements.  It speeds things up immensely!
---

Ya priest is fine leveling, I was talking more about life at 60 having to solo for gold of reputation quests, etc.
---
I'm curious about the addon that gives the minimap, bars, bags and portraits a black outline. And for the bars, are you using Bartender?
---
I stopped spending at 30 and only trained damage skills til 40, and then i set a goal of 10g per level, made the 90g sometime around 38 and then i blew the rest catching up on training. Spent a lot of time killing profitable beasts and vendoring gray trash to get there.
---
This reply makes me think you are not experiencing the problem that some people are, maybe due to your faction.  I enjoy PVP servers a lot.  I don't mind getting ganked occasionally, or being attacked by someone, my level or higher.  Its expected.   Its a PVP server.  It mixes up the game and adds to the experience.  
---
However--there is a difference between PVP and being so heavily outnumbered that you basically have a target on your back and cannot go into any contested leveling zone without dying 8 or more times an hour.  As you probably know, many of the quests invite players of both factions to the same areas to kill the same mobs, so if the server is high pop and skewed, you're naturally going to have more of one side in these areas.  Sometimes this is fine, but after awhile being on the lower faction side you can start to feel trapped and like you can't quest anywhere.  Just getting a single quest done takes forever and it makes the game not fun at all.
---
I listen to the in-game music. It's absolutely amazing. Always have, always will.
---
Can probably report someone for that. At least on retail if two people agree to exchange payment for something and the person doesn‚Äôt pay they can be punished. GMs can access chat logs and see what items were traded and if payment went through.
---
That's it? That's all you've got? Are all your barely literate responses from 2005? No wonder you need someone else to level your character for you.
---
This is likely a classic old bug
---
Parkour!
---
Username checks out.
---
You can't see them because they are created by players. You can type /join MyRedditChannel, and if it doesn't exists you will create it, and other players may join it.
---
Sorry to say that i have not taken any screenshots but an entire guild on Mirage Raceway can confirm at least 1 case. One can tell simply by the level of the english written when communicating. When it's very clear that it's 2 different people playing during levelling and when the toon is 60. As well as the skill level suddenly dropping a lot.
---
When I first got these I put them up for 100g, the lowest price at these time. Some guy whispers me several times about me selling them for 50g. I was like lol no. Then it's a few days later and I've kept getting undercut and undercut. They're down to 80g. That same guy whispers me again, and I compromise, ultimately selling them for 65g. Now they're down to like 40g. I think I came out ahead.
---
I believe Blizzards first fix to all this was cross-realm sharding... We all know where that inevitably led.
---
If you don‚Äôt want to deal with supply / demand of an actual market, and want a set amount for your goods, go sell to an NPC.
---
Otherwise buy low, sell high.
---
Ive been linking other peoples profession books "lfw" fastest money making strat
---
One is remarkably less bad though.
---
As a mage who rolls a healer alt, I like sheeping opposite faction players in wpvp then killing whatever mob they were fighting and going in my way...I'm helping! They can fully heal this way and feel good. Of course that's only when I'm feeling really nice.
---
yep go where you are slightly overleveled
---
ü¶ÄBlizzard support mods don‚Äôt careü¶Ä
---
Im disappointed there isnt more to this.
---
Maybe i dont have a choice and still want to progress.
---
On Nost i cleared all available content on One evening (bwl, MC, Ony, zg). So i was casual but cleared all. 
---
So for me, pls No meme in my raid
---
I write them down and usually search the area for an hour after I'm killed to try find them again and get vegance. I don't cross anyone off the list till I've gotten them back at least once
---
I tend to agree with OP. I‚Äôm on a PVP server, but I‚Äôm all for fair fights. I won‚Äôt kill an enemy player that is current fighting a mob and has 15% HP left. I‚Äôll either just run by or wait for him to heal so we can have a fair and challenging fight. 
---
Like in STV last night, 3 Horde level 50+ camped a quest giver (quests around level 32). Where is even the fun in that?
---
Negligible. Play what you like
---
If the edited version doesn‚Äôt work go to 2hr 15 min
---
Ah ok. Is there a website or addon that shows me the efficiency of my spells?
---
43 rogue here, didn't get my mount till 42, but I think I may have had less gold than you at 37. The trolls in STV have a lot of vendor trash and occasional loot and are pretty densely packed.
---
Another good place to go is swamps of sorrows, the wyrmkin there (not welps) that roam around the lake are good. They are skinable humanoids, so in addition to dropping silver and vendor trash, they can be skun for heavy leather.
---
Classic is a RPG retail is an ARPG. It has more in common with diablo then ye olde wow nowadays.
---
I spent about 7 hours farming elementals in the badlands to afford mine. I started at 38 and by the time I was about 41 I was able to afford it. I‚Äôm a rogue if that helps
---
I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs absolutely wrong though, there are much more quests than needed to get to 60
---
&gt;Hey kid‚Ä¶ You want unlimited power? Buy now at the low-low-low-low-low price of your eternal soul ^(and the destruction of your entire planet, ruin of your culture and its way of life), 
---
Okay... but what's the catch?
---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
When does the VW stop being useful? I'm 18 ATM and it's extremely good. I was soloing all those dreaded caves and mob camps that would need a group or several deaths for most classes and basically never need to eat or drink because I barely take any damage.
---
I kinda dread when I have to take the beatings myself because using the imp may have more DPS but it is far less safe.
---
In vanilla the rule was screenshot or it didn‚Äôt happen.
---
I don‚Äôt believe anyone without proof.
---
Note, mages will want to backpedal out of range after a Frost Nova, when AoEing. If you run sideways, the leeway system kicks in and the mobs just nuke you to death if you've got enough on top of each other.
---
If you backpedal, they don't hit you.
---
Do you have to wait for the MCP buff to run out or can you, buff switch for 30 seconds, switch back, buff, switch to warden etc? Weapon switching triggers a GCD though right?
---
Nice!   I'm an orc slowly working on my UC rep for a Skeleton Horse, at least you start friendly, I start Neutral!
---
And the fact that the vast majority of people are still leveling.
---
I am serious with the post. I posted it to see if others have had the same experience as me and others i've spoken with in-game. All of which has quit the game entirely or switched servers. I've decided to give the game another go on another server because from what has been written by many here, it seems that i've had bad luck with the server. I can already feel a different with the community on the new server i'm playing on. (pvp server now)
---
I would buy what you can as soon as possible, last week the devilsaur pieces were going for around 60 to 70 a piece on my server, this week they're up to 100 a piece.
---
Does it vendor for that much??????????
---
classic :D
---
Eyyy, i started a priest in old blanchy, stopped at lvl 16 and switched to Incendious and now have a 37 paladin and 31 hunter
---
I laughed, I cried, I lost 5 pounds.   Great vid
---
Gnomes are absolutely indisputably best-in-every-scenario race choice  for mages and warlocks on alliance side. They are also pretty good choice for pvp-oriented warriors and rogues.
---
Wow Blizz support people don't give 2 fucks.
---
I mean it just takes some quick maff so idk. Divide the healing value of your spell by its mana cost and you have its healing per 1 mana
---
Yeah I loved desolace. It was also the perfect balance between pvp and chill questing. I‚Äôd always join in the fights I was running by but for the most part you were left alone.
---
Was scrolling at work and thought your title had read "Foreskin."
---
Real life isn't that great anyway, no quests, terrible loot, and the respawn timer is extremely long.
---
For any race other than human or orc, yes. Going from 300 to 305 weapon skill reduces the amount of +hit you need on gear to reach the hit cap for special attacks from 9% to 6%, and reduces the damage penalty from glancing blows. For boss level mobs that is.
---
I hope you read the reply to my 3.5s post, apparently +gear doesn't change that in any way.
---
WHEW!
---
Thank God I'm playing Holy DPS and not Ret.
---
Where do you turn in runecloth?
---
No... It's a joke on the op saying all herbs except black lotus sell for only a little bit above vendor prices.
---
Do a GetAll scan (the blue arrow), takes seconds.
---
I rolled PVE server so I don‚Äôt have to deal with any of this because I knew I wasn‚Äôt a hardcore player that can hit 60 in a week; instead of being ten levels behind on a pvp server and not enjoying it
---
I think typically the whole group rolls need on BoE epics, to prevent ninja looting. Although i would think it‚Äôd be common courtesy to not roll need if the item is an actual major upgrade for someone in the group.
---
What series is this? I must watch it, looks very relatable.

Nope, Lucifron

Yes, just because you‚Äôre ‚Äúpopular‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre marketable &amp; in my opinion every video I‚Äôve seen of him is obnoxious &amp; crude.

Pretty much every server does it, regardless of RP. They don't even RP about it. They just want your gold for a service.

It is like claiming Trade is more of a RP community thing. It isn't.

The internet has spoken and we like this video.

Oh

He's awesome. Camped for a week in vanilla to tame him, kept him until 60 because of the look.

Just got my chicken for my lvl 40 mage and it was killing me....
---
I told a guildy that was a friend of a friend who wanted me to run it with him on an at level druid "No, not unless everyone is in discord" He was all "Nah, it's np, we all pros. We just need a tank!"

How do you claim all 3 collector edition pet on the same character?
---
I have collectors but I can't seem to figure out how to claim the other pets.
---
I've seen someone with all 3 in Classic so I know it's possible.
---
Strange, I was in Hawaii when wow launched on holiday, I installed it on my laptop, created my character and set up my UI - when I went home to Australia and started playing I didn't have any issue with this
---
he was chasing the pesky roadrunner
---
Ahh okay let me fix that for you. I‚Äôll post the correct build.
---
Wait, TSM works for Classic?  I thought they weren‚Äôt supporting it!?
---
Opie is great for moving rarely used skills or stuff you don't use in combat off your action bars like tradeskills, resurrect etc. It puts everything in a nice simple ring menu that pops up on a hotkey
---
but there's only one quest making it not worth it iirc
---
They were all mages and all level 60
---
Just a regular horse? Lame.
---
While this is pretty clearly a troll post, I would love for someone to theorycraft the shit out of that build.
---
24 seconds is the full length of CoA. Longer is irrelevant 90+% of the time. For most mobs, it's immolate, corruption, drain life, and out in 12 seconds, more or or less a couple. Maybe a wand shot or 2 to finish. If it's taking more than 18 seconds for you to finish a mob, you're either at the ass end of upgrading your spells or you're not doing it right.
---
And then again, you won't have to fight tooth and nail for every single quest mob ever in the starting zones now
---
General rule is people get greedy when boes drop, blues or purples. 
---
Personally, I wouldn't roll need if someone else actually needed it. But they better equip it right then and there! :)

Idk what fucking pathing you have but 5 runs is not 25 minutes nor does each one guarantee a drop.

if they're underpriced by 75% like you say, snap them up and resell them.

yeah i love to carry 30 other players who cant be bothered to give a shit about other peoples time, and cause a 2 hour raid to take 5 hours. This thread is full of shit takes.  
---
If you dont want to play meta, dont play meta, join a guild of other shitters and spend 2 nights a week wiping in MC for endless hours. But don't come on reddit and make a post about how its unfair that you feel "forced" into the meta and that other people should just pick up your slack because you want to play 17/17/17 "PerfectlyBalancedRestoferakin" and waste 39 other peoples time.
---
It's still an RPG whether you're on an RP server or not...
---
I'm still waiting for the 300? Gold I gave some one in my guild in TBC for flying. I am confident he will eventually pay me back.
---
Treasure chest hunting is one of my favorite leveling past times. Just creeping around likely spots and peeking in huts. Its mostly apples and cheese and bolts of wool cloth but sometimes you strike it rich with a blue sapphire or some boe twink gear. Its even sweeter when you realize the hunter questing in the area would have found it eventually if you hadnt been a sneak.
---
Except in EVE he would let you take the portal, and his friends would be gatecamping on the other side and ransom you for all your ~~credits~~ gold or ~~pod~~ *delete(?)* you.
---
Is it expensive to skill up?
---
I like this. It‚Äôs a fancy way of saying all I do at end game is summon people and banish elementals.
---
How are you exiting the game? If you crash, DC, or alt-f4 out of your game your settings might not save properly. Make sure you use the proper ‚Äúexit game‚Äù button and try that way.
---
For me it was the inherent coolness factor, then I stayed for the feeling of UNLIMITED... POOOOOOOWWEEEEEEEEEEEERRRR!!!!!!
---
I dunno about PvP, and not planning to touch raiding, but the gameplay in general is fun.
---
I noticed this for the first time yesterday. I have no idea what addon it is...
---
Without it you hit like a wet noodle.
---
I agree with this, things will progressively get more expensive, and spike in phase 2.  I'm not worried about getting my epic mount yet, I'm going to be scooping up all the arcane crystals I can and hoarding them after I buy all the BoE pre-raid BiS stuff I need.   Tonight I'll check devilsaur gloves on AH, last night they were about 80g and I fully expect there to be a bunch of under-cutters and I'll buy a set for 60-70g at peak time.  Next weekend I'll do the same thing with the leggings.  I'm really dying inside because I don't have a miner who can farm thorium - probably wont before P2, as my professions are herb and alch.
---
50gold per hour? Tell me your farming spot pls XD
---
This. Over the past ~10 years of playing various MMORPG private servers, I've seen countless cases of people getting banned and then coming crying to the forums that they were "banned for no reason" and then a GM shows up and points out the reason why they were banned.
---
Had around 110g when I dinged 40 on my warrior. Aside from sm lvling I did grind a few levels in shimmering flats and I‚Äôm a miner/skinner. Vendoring all skins and selling ore/stones in ah for profit.
---
You should invest in the Wolfshead helmet, it worked wonders for me in that bracket. Assuming you are feral.
---
That‚Äôs not what anyone is talking about. The comment was that his wife wouldn‚Äôt let him.
---
KEEP YER FEET ON TEH GROUND!
---
Gotta learn to peal just the one, tank hits from his bros while running them and watch all but her target run back. Its annoying and doesnt work if you buff or heal, buy you'll need to learn it.
---
There are still alliance on skeram?
---
Do what you want. It'll just be a little harder to find groups where a warrior tank would let you in and potentially roll on their gear.
---
I'm 54. Guess I'm killing stuff too fast, must be me that's doing something wrong. I'll have to study the charts some more to figure out how to play.
---
Playing a stealthy character on a server where you're in the minority faction has its benefits. It's gurella warfare out here.
---
You really didn't catch the fun did you?
---
You can still train all skills and afford mount at 40.
---
Tbh they arent missing out on anything on the pvp realm except the occassional getting camped by level 60 shadow priests or 5 man groups for trying to solo quest. Pvp realm isnt as exciting as most people think. Many people I see now just ignore eachother as we level since theres no point in it for a lot of them other than to bm someone. Phase 2 its just gonna be the worse part of camping at the last leveling stretch to get honor gear. 
---
If you are enjoying a pve realm you probably made a decent choice :)
---
Didn't know it was a reference tbh, what's it from?
---
dam never thought bout this. THanks
---
If the raid relies on PUGs, the raid is as dependent on them as they are on it. There‚Äôs always another MC PUG out there.
---
&gt; the census data showed 90% of all NA PvP realms were significantly dominated by horde.
---
Which census data was that?
---
‚ÄúBetter‚Äù - do me a fucking favour. If you‚Äôve played WoW for even a few months (let alone the 15 years I‚Äôve been playing), you have all the skills you need to level effectively. It‚Äôs about time investment.
---
Some people have invested a lot of time into classic already and I don‚Äôt disparage them for having done so, that‚Äôs fine and they have their rewards for having done so.
---
It‚Äôs also well-documented that *some* people used various exploits like the raid bug and layering to get to 60 way faster than should be normally possible.
---
My point was that to be 60 with an off-faction epic mount, you must fall into one of two camps: invested a lot of time into classic or have exploited.
---
I dont see anything wrong with achievements really. 
---
If classic+ does happen, I'd like to see achieves come in. They're just fun little sub-goals you can work towards if you like.
---
Everything is hunter's weapon
---
Learn to use "cc break" report
---
Right now I'm playing it patiently. Put DoTs on the enemy, Life Tap a bit, then Drain Life/Drain Soul until the enemy dies.
---
It seems to be a terrible advice to use Imp on lower levels instead because you are not "tanky" yet since you lack important talents.
---
It‚Äôs for the future when you figure out you‚Äôre invincible in 1v1 and start abusing your power.
---
When TBC hit and JC was all the rage I used to  run off with everyones for gems. Blizz eventually started banning for it. But yeah I learned the jack moves from EvE before I started playing WoW.

&gt; If you ever had any concern about being ganked by the other faction, being outnumbered on a PVP server, or not being able to quest because of world pvp you should have rolled PVE. Simple.

People have their reasons, the world isn't so black and white, grow up.

Yes!  I actually came to this conclusion myself but unfortunately was already mid-way leveled by then.  Being a rogue or druid would have made these situations much more tolerable. lol

Play what you want but don't expect others to want to play with you when you play a spec like that. Find a guild that lets you but don't expect everyone to be ok with a subpar spec in a raid. And shadowpriests were never considered bad in arena pvp in TBC.
---
That sounds like a sure way to get DPSes to go balls to the wall and make life harder for the tank.

Had a persistent NE Druid trying to kill me in badlands last night. I saved a horde Druid from him when I was questing which seemed to make him stalk me instead of the other Druid. 
---
This guy was determined. First he picked a fair fight and I buried him in the dirt. Then he waited until I was  half HP and fighting a mob. This time I barely beat him thanks to a timely renew from a nearby shadowpriest. Then another few 1v1s that he lost. 
---
Finally i thought he had me when I was fighting a rock elemental, I‚Äôm low HP with both chasing me when the Druid aggros another rock elemental, and my kiting causes the first one to drop me and turn on the Druid for some reason. I had like 100 hp and the elementals killed him as I mounted up and ran off. 
---
Poor guy, maybe he‚Äôll get me one day as I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm on some list of his now.

---
You need 9% total, but there is a talent in survival that gives you 3% with 3 points.  If you're a dwarf or a troll with a gun or a bow, respectably, you only need about 3% hit from gear to cap with your +weapon racial and +hit talent.
---
to be fair, it‚Äòs your own fault if you think going with level 30 to STV is a good idea.
---
My understanding was that MCP is good because it generates more threat. 
---
It's not completely required, but the threat generation allows your dps to go ham without worrying about pulling aggro. So with that in mind, if you're holding threat currently: you dont need MCP yet. It all depends on your group.
---
Except it is...
---
Yeah but I think I can live without Sentry Totem for the time being.
---
I am seeing that this is going to become an issue on my new server.  It's now flooding with the lower faction from other realms and is becoming skewed in the opposite direction.  I wish they could redirect somewhere else now before this new realm gets a massive imbalance.
---
They're doing this for less than those mages that claim their portal in Org is worth 1g because they have to jump off the bank in Org.

yes been using the exit game button. Just tried it again and it didn't work
---
You say that until you get server like Illidan. It started off ok then all they alliance left and the server became 99% horde. It was no longer a pvp server but a horde only server. For years I didn‚Äôt see a single alliance player out in the world. Only pvp you got was in a bg.
---
Then you‚Äôd be even worse, because it‚Äôs a PUG so you‚Äôd be inflicting a repair bill on other PUGs who had absolutely nothing to do with the raid leader‚Äôs bullshit and who were probably just as outraged as you.

The molten core has 7 runes that have to be doused, if you are done with waterlords quests you can pick up a one time use douse. If ur raid group has less than 7 people with access to douses, you have to go back and forth to douse every rune, and pick up a new one from azhara

This is exactly the problem.  Its not fun being the outnumbered side.  But its also not fun when there are zero competitors out in the world either, then its not really a PVP server.
---
If you have good enough gear that you can afford to use immolate that‚Äôs great. It‚Äôs an optional part of the rotation for a reason. I simply take issue with whoever recommended it as the opener because in most situations it‚Äôs not optimal to open with immolate.

No need, dude. You probably quested and filled in with dungeon runs as the "normal" way of playing WoW. Ofc you could've looked for a group that grinds dungeon with AOE Cleave abusing the Raid EXP in the first 1.5 weeks to reach 60 and grind other stuff. But important is you do what is most fun for yourself.
---
Does this sub not like Icy Veins or something? Because the past couple times I've responded to someone asking about class guides I recommend Icy Veins and always get downvoted. I think they're a very good resource, no? Wowhead is also great, but for in-depth class guides I think Icy Veins is fantastic.
---
You only support my hypothesis. Lol
---
At almost every level there are at least 2 zones to do quests in. You want to do both; start one, then start there next, then finish one and finish the other. 
---
If you try to 100% one zone at a time, you will find yourself with a bunch of red quests and need to be carried by higher level players.. Or spend a ton of time grinding entire levels, which is unnecessary and where a lot is people start to burn out.
---
i' ve never seen it, but in spain we sometimes use "=", which means "same". so if someone says "nice to meet you", we'll respond "="
---
im saying this because ive never seen an english speaking guy use it
---
Had my phone and ended up setting my tablet up next to the keyboard for YouTube / Netflix
---
That isn't really a reset
---
If anything, drop enchanting for skinning. Easy money while you level, and if you're set on enchanting you can pick it back up later.
---
Price wise, disenchanting things doesn't start being more valuable than vendoring them until 50+ or so.
---
Next time you want to call someone out at least post the whole quote....
---
"Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan."
---
Layering does not affect the server limitations that are already set in place. 10k ppl spread across 10 different layers is still 10k people logged into one server. Layering just reduced the stress on the server by reducing the amount of people that are loaded into the same physical area.
---
I have fun by playing efficiently and that involves not playing with dogshit specs like ret and boomkin. Stop trying to ruin my fun!!!!
---
people ignore each other right now because there is no honor. Phase 2 will be a lot of fun and not just "camping".
---
I'm in the game partly for exploration. Shimmering flats is the single worst zone for me so far, just a flat pancake of desert. It's quite good for quests though, got me a lvl. I ended up doing both.
---
I prefer icy veins, I think their 1-60 class guides are great.
---
If you get invited to a group, especially a guild group, and you aren't a member of that guild, the VERY first thing you should ask (after saying Hello) is simply:  "Are any items on reserve?".   
---
You can't blame people for wasting your precious 30m of time if you fail to ask a question you should KNOW you need to ask.

What's the proper emote to initiate pvp? I see a rogue minding his business grinding mobs, and I wanna fight him, what emote should I use
---
I dont know but other proffessions are 4,5g or 5g so probably 5g
---
And here we have the problem, DPS party lead doesn't understand why he can't form groups. While leveling, DPS players got used to being able to build their own groups arms wars half-ass tanking. So they think the game will always be this way. Now they suddenly realize endgame dungeons favor actual specced-tanks (of which there are few because tank life is shit). These are the same tanks who voluntarily give up the ability to farm gold, be effective at pvp, stay forever poor because of high repair bills, and being useless in all other aspects of the game... just so they can carry your DPS ass in dungeons/raids so you can have some fun. While you moan about threat, complain about pulling too slow, doing general "we didn't wipe so its okay" passive aggressive body pulls. 
---
DPS will realize they are a dime a dozen and every tank-led group (especially with a healer) has whispers flooding in from every single dps class. If you start a group as a tank, there is literally no wait time to form up. So why should they take a rogue who brings no party buffs, is melee, and competes with them in gear? They DON'T. You should feel lucky groups will bring a rogue even if you paid gold.
---
Ive been in multiple groups that were being set up where someone is over-level trying to get gear..they join the group and see one other wearer of that gear and leave because their "chances" of getting it are too low. I tell them to go to retail because you get your own loot, no rolls there.
---
You spin me right round, baby right round, like a record baby right round right round

Look for guides about what spells to buy from the trainers and make sure to kill everything you see for their coin and vendor trash that's gotta remedy the losses from your repair costs...

Nobody is going to care unless you're in an absolute top tier raiding guild, or PvP group.

Or the alternative were they are specifically looking for classes/specs that don't need any gear of the bosses.

Esfand is probably the best geared, actually skilled ret paladin right now and he does maybe half as much damage as a warrior while adding what, a blessing buff? Maybe a dispel or bop if he isnt totally out of mana? Meme spec have their niche but saying they contribute in a raid environment is a stretch. They are slotted as dps but cant perform at the same level as most damage classes. They are absolutely being carried. Its not a big deal in molten snore but it doesnt make it less true.

Dude actually play the game instead of paying for things like this smh.

There is a spot you can stand in the first room that'll allow you to /target Jeb to see if he is up, we rotate people through UBRS to try to force the spawn.

Teaches you how to kite and control the camera on the fly too, got to make sure the path your taking them is clear of mobs too.

Mograine. Nice.
---
D: use a coaster, you're gonna leave a ring!
---
That seems especially cheap, but they‚Äôve definitely been cheaper on retail than they usually were on private servers. I assume it‚Äôs mostly because of the aoe farming meta making people kill significantly more mobs while leveling. My advice to anybody looking to get a boe epic that‚Äôs bis for them is to buy it soon while there‚Äôs still so many on the market. I assume prices will go up for the ones that stay good for longer.
---
Because that's what you do on PvP servers. Alliance are just as douchey get off your fucking high horse.
---
I fish while im at work when I get the time.
---
No. Fist weapons are still weapons. You still hit with them.
---
Druids have weapons, and the buffs get applied to them. But they hit with their claws, so the weapon buffs never get a chance to be relevant.
---
I remember killing and camping a lvl 37 tauren warrior from ISR when I was only 32. Good times.

Level 50 rogue. Where is a good place to grind out a level or two? Would be awesome if mobs drop cloth.

You can always /duel

Humar looks dope! Only black lion model in the game and still has 1.3 attack speed which is pretty good.
---
I have both humar and BT and I prefer humar. I realize BT outputs a little bit more damage with faster speed, but humar looks too cool to put away
---
You're taking a miniscule disadvantage in PVE and trading a massive advantage in PVP. Totally worth it even if you only PVP when heading to and from Blackrock Mountain.

And here we have the problem.
---
A tank thinking he‚Äôs some hero who carries everyone he ever groups with.
---
You‚Äôre not a hero, you‚Äôre someone who chose to play a certain role in a video game. You‚Äôre greatly appreciated by groups you run with, and have full priority on every tank drop, as well as equal roll on dps gear you may need, plus you get groups the second you want them. This attitude of superiority is actually mind blowing.

That is not a tip.

5 point combo rip'd his ass

Most people dont browse reddit and if theyre on a very Horde / Alliance heavy server and barely see someone from the other faction they will take the fight every time simply because its such a rare occurrence.
---
Meanwhile the people from the lower populated side get into fights non stop.
---
They may have told you it isn't very profitable to keep you from becoming competition.

The reagent itself costs like 40s or something. But yeah I really should train it
---
I have pretty horrible luck. I played on private servers and even aoe farmed probably close to 5k gold in dire maul on my mage alt and never got a single boe epic drop. Got a krol blade while leveling on retail, though. Felt good!
---
Stuff like this scares me.  I travel for work and sometimes will log in from a different hotel in a different city for 3 days straight.
---
Desolace is better at 35+ 
---
And even then there aren't a huge amount of quests there.

Oh.. oh no

What server were you on? Horde has a tough time finding world pvp on many servers. If wpvp is your thing alliance has much more opportunity for it.

I got mine as a warrior at 40. Made my gold by vendoring grays and only lvling important skills. Not sucking also helped.

I honestly didn't even think that was possible
---
6% hit for Trolls, 9% hit for every other race
---
Grow up?  To be what?  A stupid fuck that thinks that PVP means PVP only when its fair?
---
This so much, first thing I want to do when Phase 2 comes.

You have it all wrong. No one has called you a liar. The other poster was only saying that it wasn't proof because you *might* have faked the screenshots. I don't think you did but they are 100% right.
---
The chicken is not from KFC
---
&gt; Do I help this guy, even though it doesn't benefit me?
---
I would say yes, almost always, with the caveat of it not hurting you / costing you much in the process to help. While I've had "real" groups for quests and dungeons, I've also had plenty of informal groups where like people are tagging and clearing individual monsters to eventually carve a path towards a shared goal like a container that doesn't despawn. The lack of xp for mobs tagged by other people is no big deal if it allows you all to get through faster, especially if respawn timers are a concern.
---
I can give a good example of where such an action paid off. I was doing the elites part of the Solution to Doom chain (The Star, The Hand and The Heart), specifically the troll one. I didn't seek out a group, as I generally did not see people calling for it in general chat (and assumed it was vaguely soloable) and because I handily soloed one of the three elites earlier as a test run. With the troll one though I quickly realized I have to beat a path through a LOT of trolls. Not elite, but still a large enough number that solo play is methodical. By the time I finally get to my destination I feel a bit deflated when I see the target elite troll surrounded by adds. I was thinking how I am going to try to pack separate to make this more manageable. I start, and by the time I've taken care of two adds I see the big boy is already tagged. Tagged by a Forsaken too, whereas I'm alliance. 
---
I sigh and just wait. It's not a PvP server, but I probably wouldn't have tried to kill him anyways as I'm not that kind of player. For a while this Forsaken is doing okay, but towards the end of the elite's HP I see him running around, seemingly trying to kite with DoTs. I hover over the Horde player and notice his own HP is awful, and I couldn't tell if he was desperately trying to kite or actually very nearly on the brink of death and just running. Now again, no PvP, but I did have the option of potentially letting this player die to have the target back to myself. Instead though, I know the struggle, and have had plenty of experiences with randoms where they helped even if they didn't have to. So I chip in with my full health and mana and help finish off the elite. The Forsaken gets their loot and runs off, while I just wait and pick off slowly respawning trash mobs out of boredom. Quite some time later I see another Forsaken pop out from a different direction and seemingly stand around also waiting for the respawn. I sigh again with the thought of another wait and likely getting tag stolen, and focus back on the respawning trash mobs to help with another quest I had. However, when the elite pops back up, I notice the tag has not been stolen despite me being a decent distance away from it. I see the Forsaken start emoting, though I got myself caught in a mass respawn of basic trolls before I really noticed. As I start clearing them painfully, he eventually runs by and helps out. I think I had understood his intent by this point of the elite STILL being up, and I go and tag the elite up. As I do so he jumps into action and helps out with the adds there. The kill goes extremely smoothly, and it's only around now that I realize the SAME Forsaken that I had helped actually came back to return the favor instead of just going on his merry way with no obligations, doubly so because of cross-faction. We exchange some waves and salutes, and both managed to knock out the quest all from a simple act of kindness.

Theres the tale about how rage works

When you as the player has high rage your character has none. And when your character has rage you are calm.

Thats why you are angry, its not that you didnt get rage for the miss its that you as in YOU got it instead of the character

FUS RO DAAAAH  !

Dammnit , wrong game

Why do you need to reroll?

Is Tailoring good to pick up for leveling?
---
Dem bags and cloth gear looks nice.
---
I'm taking my time so I don't mind if I need to grind some cloth... more vendor trash and coin for my spells.
---
I would agree. 38 here. My options are 
---
- get ganked in STV
---
- run back and forth for hours in badlands with no flight point
---
- run back and forth for hours in desolace 
---
- get ganked in arathi
---
20-30 went so much faster. At this point I'm probably just gonna farm beasts in badlands until 40 so I can get the rest of my mount money to boot.
---
People are retarded , spirit tap does trigger right now.
---
If by "a lot of fun" you mean getting camped at level 52 while leveling by a few 60s because you are worth honor points. Phase 2 will be fun but make no mistake, leveling will be even more of a shithole. So if you are looking to level effectively, I understand doing a pve realm with opt in pvp for phase 2.
---
Is there any working WeakAura for Overpower in Classic?
---
I found one, but it only shows the Icon when im in Battle Stance, and not when im in Berserker stance
---
Grob is an amazing server. It's my first exp with an RP server and I'm totally enjoying it.
---
He hit it going too fast in their ferrari dire wolf
---
I've got an alt with skinning and mining, on the advice of someone I was talking to here. He said mining will earn far more than skinning, since two professions use ore, bars, etc.
---
I price the ore below competitors' price, and about half of it will sell over the course of 24 hours. I have to re-list the other half, usually along with any new stuff I've picked up.  I price leather/hides below the lowest price, it sells instantly.
---
Leather doesn't sell for nearly as much, but there's a lot more of it and it sells as soon as I list it.
---
That alt is only around level 20, so things might turn around at higher levels, but I was considering dropping mining.
---
&gt;rogue and Druid only
---
As a combat rogue I can't seem to beat the 57E archmages and the 56s I have to burn adrenaline rush for. What am I doing wrong
---
Not exactly the fairest reply, It's BIS for enhancement shamans as well. By this logic one would be able to "need" roll on every BoE while leveling because it all adds up to a sum which assists in buying an epic mount, something which everyone is working on. If something drops which you specifically are able to use and intend to use it that is what the "need" function is there for. If something drops which you intend to sell for another purpose it's for "greed", in the sense that the item itself is not directly useful to you despite it's value. The other players are being greedy in this sense, but saying they "need" it for profit alone.
---
That's a question that only very few people could possibly answer.
---
I'd say you're better off submitting a support ticket asking how.
---
In 2006 everyone was waiting around in ironforge to raid or waste time. Right now most people are out leveling.
---
This is perfection
---
Yes it is, if you don‚Äôt take that one the journey doesn‚Äôt happen. If that first step is on a
---
LEGO piece you won‚Äôt go any farther.
---
There are plenty of people with gold to spend, especially people who already got their epic mounts and buyable BiS gear such as myself. What else am I going to spend my gold on if not twink items to resell later or use and vanity items such as pets. 75g is like 1.5 hours of farming (for certain classes) which is a solid investment for one of the best twink bows that can sell for more later down the line.
---
This is like being at a conference for anti-vaxxers. 
---
"I beat a warrior in a 1v1 once *and* i don't have polio. That means you are full of shit"
---
"If warriors are so great then how come i had to use my 60 mage to rush my lvl 12 warrior buddy through rfc?"
---
"DPS charts lie- they only show the damage that each person does to the the target they're fighting- thats why fury is always at the top"
---
"If warriors didnt have MS, couldnt wear plate and were always solo they wouldnt win arathi basin *every* time"
---
... and so on
---
What? We definitely farmed that shit in Tyr's hand waaay before prepatch
---
Ya know, some might consider playing a game like wow or browsing a site like reddit would be considered a waste of time. As long as they enjoyed the journey and the result, then can we say it was a waste?
---
It‚Äôs great, makes it a lot easier and more streamlined. Fixes some quest tracking issues
---
It does trigger from pvo, so stop your bs spreading.
---
I know Disc isn‚Äôt great but when you are doing incredibly easy content(60 dungeons, Ony, MC) then Power Infusion is debatably more useful. That‚Äôs why every pug Priest in dungeons right now tends to have PI. 
---
How does it work in combat? When did healing specs get 50% in combat spirit regen? I know how the 5 second rule works and how disc meditation works but where is this 50% from? You can clearly see while leveling any hybrid class that your mana definitely does not regen outside of the 5 second rule and meditation is 15%.
---
I‚Äôm 46 and know I won‚Äôt finish because I make alts to much.
---
And in dungeons? Doesn't work if you doesn't do a decent junk of damage
---
Lots of good PvP on Herod. There are more horde but I still see tons of alliance while out and about questing. Queues are so small now too. I get home, queue up, and by the time I finish dinner I'm in.
---
I get it, everyone's broke... But listing things just 1 copper away from vendorprice+deposit? How the fuck is it profitable?!
---
opt in pvp means nobody does pvp. Don't kid yourself.
---
Hell yeah brother, I'm still irked that my male orc can't wear nipple clamps. Where's my choice Blizzard??

It depends on the time of day.

We have terrible scaling and I said half decent and half bad.

I still think UD strat is harder for the average player lol.  Played with dudes who have no issue in mc but they aggro gargs like no tomorrow.

Yep. Being able to remove a frost nova or crippling poison every 60 seconds is massive.
---
Just went through this last night with a friend.
---
We're running RFD, and Ebony Boneclub drops. It's a pretty nice upgrade for him as a Warrior so he Needs and wins it. There's even another Warrior in the group who says Gratz. Everyone is content besides the Druid Healer who starts freaking out because my friend rolled need on a blue BoE and everyone else greeded. Like... I get it if it's an Epic or just a really good expensive item but like... Ebony Boneclub? Who cares? I really don't think it's worth very much at all.
---
But anyways we re-rolled and my friend was so confused because he didn't understand why he shouldn't need on an upgrade, and I had to explain to him that this need/greed thing for BoE's was a pretty hotly contested subject.
---
Luckily I won the re-roll so he got to keep it anyways, and what do you know, he equipped it right away. =P
---
Storage is on Q and E as it is by default.

You can't to my knowledge.  I don't think the box that starts the quest is transferable.
---
Mech keyboards are overrated
---
That is correct
---
I leveled originally on a pve realm, so you are only exactly wrong about that. People would walk around flagged constantly. Even more so in STV, Hillsbrad and the Plaguelands. People formed groups to pvp or start shit at enemy camps. So yes you cant gank people at 15% hp nearly as often but there will be plenty of people to fight, who are looking to fight, in phase 2 on the pve realms.

You seem like you really enjoy PVP.  Perhaps you should transfer to an opposite balance server so you have more people to PVP with. &lt;3
---
Im quite calm , i just dont like people spreading bs
---
I hate to disappoint but blizzard isn't going to do phase 2 any time soon. What's the average time to level to 60? ~7 days in game time? Classic has been out for a month that means people who are 60 right now have literally spent 25% of the month playing wow and left the other 75% for school, work, sleep, eating, etc. 
---
People who are 60 right now are considered hardcore players and blizzard has never released content on a hardcore player schedule.
---
Yeah it's more something I thought people picked up from programming, considering how many people in WoW seem to be in IT or Development in some way.
---
I'm only 54, but I've been leveling extremely casually (stopping to help guildies to dungeons, helping my wife level, etc). I'm literally sitting idle for hours. Had I been efficient about it, I would have been 60 w/ my epic mount.
---
I'm married, have a stressful career, and have been moving a bunch of recording gear into my basement. I also can't emphasize the stressful career part. I often pass out at, like, 10pm. I've probably missed out on at least a week of playing because of that.
---
If you prioritize your time, it's really not difficult to accomplish things in Classic.
---
Haha I just did this quest last night and was really wondering what it was saying. Thanks OP!
---
I regret my formatting... i was trying to make a joke about what the people responding to this post are saying.
---
Huehue he is fat and his name means fat!
---
so clever blizzard!!
---
It is a violation of the game terms and is considered a scam.
---
You can report him and maybe even get him banned for that (but only for a small amount like 3 days or something around that)
---
So this is basically whining about how you're not getting as much as you think you should get, rather than realizing what supply and demand is.
---
Got it.
---
This is roughly the timeline:
---
1. Jaina meets Horde people, they all want to be friends
---
2. Jaina's dad (Daelin) starts raiding and pillaging the Horde's peaceful settlements
---
3. Jaina and Horde friends try to reason with Daelin, he arrests them but they manage to escape with Jaina's help
---
4. Daelin usurps Theramore and starts a war against the Horde, but fails and retreats to Theramore
---
5. Jaina helps the Horde in their counterattack against Daelin to put a stop to the war because she knew that he would cause many unnecessary deaths
---
6. They catch Daelin in the battle and try to reason with him. He refuses and dies in battle, at which point the siege ends. Jaina mourns him and asks "Why didn't you listen?"
---
His death was entirely his fault and Jaina knew it. She didn't blame the orcs for that and was just as willing to cooperate with them after the fact. Her hating-the-Horde development is entirely a WoW thing and personally I'm not a fan.
---
Why do you block out your name?
---
So is it worth the 40 dollars?
---
Yeah, but without transmog people won't pay 150g+ on a staff they can replace by doing one quest and running Scholomance.
---
In the first week of classic, I definitely saw someone using all 3pets on the same character but forgot to ask how.
---
Selfish douchebags like this have always been around. I learned as a guildmaster in TBC that I had to restrict people from taking gold out of the guild bank or else they'd abuse it by taking as much as they could and then leaving the guild.
---
Feel free to dispute me then.  But I'm 99% certain according to patch notes that Tyrs Hand archmages did not drop crusader recipe until TBC prepatch.
---
Easy to farm? Overall its less than 1% for the drakestone to drop with the appropriate stats
---
Blizzard has been late to react to nearly everything that has "broken" the game so far. Things that were well known by the community weeks before Blizz stepped in. Its like they dont play their own game. So expect a reaction when the server is 95/5.
---
Its Elvui.
---
Add-on list?
---
I never play with people who just take.  Its draining on the soul.  If they are just consuners without caring about others, im fucking outs
---
Hi, /u/AnActualPlatypus

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dahdqq/hunter_pro_tip_instead_of_using_feed_pet_you_can/). 
---
I couldn‚Äôt imagine paying for an add on,....
---
Just use classicdb
---
Newbie here. Can someone give me a quick explanation as to what multi-shot does and why this guy wouldn‚Äôt want him using it?
---
AH closed twice, so maybe he bought them and immediately put them up for bidding
---
Thats not how an economy works. You put up a good deal it will sell. Simple as that. Putting something 1c lower is not a good deal.
---
You don't have a choice to play or not...  Are you kidding me?
---
You boys rescued me once. I was a noob and wanted to try exploration. I got out to the Elephants Head Nebula I think or was headed there, and naively assumes that there would just be stations in every system to refuel at. No idea what a fuel scoop was at that point. Me and my diamondback that is worked so hard for we‚Äôre stranded and I didn‚Äôt have the heart to self destruct so I kinda stopped playing for a few days, and then I heard about the fuel rats on reddit and I  was saved!
---
The guy felt sorry for me and wouldn‚Äôt take any money. 10/10 would noob again :P
---
you hit 60 too fast. There isn't much end game content. The content is in the leveling.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call that ninja‚Äòing. It was a premade of 7 people, so getting 3 other people probably didn‚Äôt take long. And they said the loot rules before you pulled any boss. 
---
It would‚Äôve been much scummier if they just said nothing, and when it dropped, they give it to the other person. 
---
Imo, this is just poor organization, and poor communication skills. They obviously wanted to make loot rules clear before any boss was killed. But like most people, they just didn‚Äôt communicate properly. No big deal, like you said, 30 minutes.
---
I think the virgin vs chad thing is a meme now
---
If you spend the time to level the hardest to level class in the game specifically to play a position nobody else wants to play and are basically mandatory, you can dictate how your groups go and avoid loot competition. 
---
It's not really a garbage attitude, if rogues want to be utilized in pve then they shouldn't have played a rogue.
---
Dude I remember that chest. I sold slowfalls to it from the bridge nearby. I made over 50,000 gold on my mage in one sitting, it was insane
---
Wow-Pro (addon) has free 40-60 guides if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for
---
It frustrates me that such a big part of hunter DPS comes from multishot yet it's so great at pulling more mobs and breaking CC, so you have to be really careful whenever you use it.
---
Bit ridiculous to lie about it though
---
I forgot charge and dash share a CD until I learned dash :|
---
yup ^^
---
What level do I need as mage to go for ZF exp runs?
---
Why would I need to transfer?  I don‚Äôt complain about my mistakes that I could have corrected myself weeks ago ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
There probably won't be another phase for months, most people won't reach 60 until the end of this year or potentially even later.
---
i use zygor myself (:
---
Hunters are MUCh more forgiving than mages. And about as good at farming gold at max lvl.
---
I take issue with anyone who says you *have* to open with any of our DoTs while leveling. They're all situational, depending on gear, level, spell rank, pet, and what you're fighting. All I'm saying is that IME the front loaded DPS of immolate is usually more useful than the back loaded DPS of CoA.
---
Almost everythin of my pre raid BiS is stuff I can start farming at level 52-55. I dont like questing much so I really only do dungeons anyway. And only a very few of them have any competition with DPS or Tanks. And most also have quite the good drop chance.
---
Wow.
---
Holy shit those prices are good
---
You probably mean Hillsbrad Foothills
---
Wait till BGs and balanced PvP launches. Vanilla PvP was more like rock, paper, scissors, warlock. Especially on ally side.
---
World or LookingForGroup are the best for anything past WC in my experience. The leveling zones just split people up past that point.
---
Might help to advertise there's a teleport. A lot of horde players actually don't know about it.
---
It's not arguable.  They *are* the best 5-man tanks in Classic.  Infinite target Consecration &amp; reflective damage &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3-target Swipe/Cleave spam.
---
Again, didn't write the tool tip. If it works differently than the tip reads, you may want to direct your emotional energy towards having blizzard fix it.
---
We have a bank alt guild called The Coin on Noggenfogger. It‚Äôs pretty cool getting the scoop on what‚Äôs happening on the AH.
---
Yeah, STV it depends, sometimes you gotta fight, sometimes not.
---
Arathi tho, everyone you see will fight you
---
There's a lot of guides but none as good as [BangerLock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM-xj_FvGng) 's guide.
---
Even if the problem is "player-created" by players transferring to go toward a server where they will have more of an advantage, or to get away from a server where they feel they are outnumbered and harassed, I still think this could somehow be at least somewhat monitored or balanced by Blizzard.  Either by limiting transfers of the heavier side to a server, or somehow offering an incentive to the lower faction.  I think something should be done or we're not going to have PVP servers at all because they will all be dominated by one faction or the other.
---
/join lookingforgroup
---
Actually it was just an ordinary case of people missing the point. There never was any accusation of lying. The objection was that the screenshots *might* have been faked and therefor do not constitute proof.
---
Yet again, Ironic, seeing as you're the one thats salty because Asmon is hosting a duel tournament
---
I put them back on AH immediately after, addon recommended 65g
---
Paladins specced for 5-man tanking (Consecration) have only drinking to worry about.  They're by far the best at holding onto aoe aggro.

Re minds me of Morrowind with all the background world building
---
along with a hunter, with a low level pet, named similarly to the surrounding NPCs.
---
Nahh I've done about 25 ZF runs by now.
---
Enemey would give you honor if we had it ingame . Everything is working
---
Your ui makes me anxious
---
Multiboxing is allowed but I don't know how this would be multiboxing, seems closer to just having multiple clients open, no?
---
Multi-shot hits all the targets in front of the hunter, indiscriminately. So it helps hunters do more damage.
---
We'd pulled too many mans, so I used polymorph to CC one of them and prevent it from hitting us. It's a pretty necessary survival tool for when things go bad. But if the polymorphed target (the sheep) takes damage, the crowd control breaks and it starts hitting us again.
---
By using multishot, the hunter hit the sheep and broke the CC, and nearly caused a wipe.
---
Ask in trade chat in any major city which is /2
---
Then type /join lookingforgroup and type in there which is /4. When you found your group type /leave 4
---
You start the godlike snowball around 40, if you keep up with dungeons and maintain decent gear for your level, as you level, you start becoming an absolute monster
---
When you choose your main you‚Äôll be able to max all professions on your alts and be extremely rich :)

30 with bis gear.

His behavior pattern is like that because he got caught red handed. They dont hand out bans like this if they are not certain. Dude got caught and wants to cry on reddit now. GG
---
Twitch has already Picture-in-Picture you don't even need an addon for it.
---
Azshara has some great humanoid/demon farming spots that drop cloth at that range.
---
That's just people trying to not get solo murdered as BRM is usually hotly contested by both factions.
---
That's my goal too! Congratulations. How did you farm it?
---
i wouldn't worry about MCP until i could solo the instance 6 times in an hour. asking an at-level group to farm gnomer for a meme weapon is a bit much. i'm afraid to ask my guildies for a group to do quests there.
---
I‚Äôm of the opposite opinion. I think achievements are nothing but flex points. Especially when people compare. 
---
That is fun for others but not me. 
---
But I wouldn‚Äôt be terribly miffed one way or the other. I understand why people like them.
---
Humour is subjective.
---
/spit usually gets a good rise.
---
I get it‚Äôs a meme but you‚Äôd be pretty stupid going to STV at 30. That‚Äôs just poor planning.
---
That explains it.
---
The quest structure isn't designed around dungeon farming.
---
Lol dont pay people to level your account. We know that's what you did.
---
Get a vape my man. Best thing I ever did for myself. Been off cigs for months.
---
Is it ethical to train a horde who spat on me eight times for no reason?
---
36 priest here. 30-33 was a long slow grind. At 33 I switched to dungeon runs (scarlet monastery library and armory). It‚Äôs much better exp than questing but worse money. The dungeons are fast too, so you don‚Äôt need to have a lot of dedicated playing time.
---
Lol ol boy eating that mic
---
Noticing the same thing. A month ago 90% of my friends list was on classic. Practically everyone back on retail now.
---
Most of my friends are mythic raiders though, which is probably the least likely to play classic for a long time.
---
That's because you keep saying stuff that are ironic
---
Naw the soullink nerf was before 1.12. 1.12 warlocks have nothing on their 1.5 version (when BGs release) selves
---
It‚Äôs called Uber, not Azeroth Taxi Service, how is it an rp thing
---
It‚Äôs efficient!
---
Having issues with knowing what to sell and what to keep, primarily white item drops from mobs. Usually I check the AH and if the price is close to the vendor price I sell to a vendor, if the item is listed with a price way above the vendor i try to save them and stack some more during my journey and then sell them at AH.
---
Its a bit tedious to travel to the AH everytime my bag is full and check and so on... so 2 questions:
---
1. Is there some sort of add-on that can help me with this?  
---
2. Could also use an add-on for just adding notes inside the game.  
---
Bonus: Am I hoarding to much? Should I just sell all whites to a vendor and get on with questing?
---
&gt; And once you find a group, if there is a mage in it there is a good chance that he will be one of the elitist ones that will insult the other DPS, be super demanding about pulls and immediately bounce if things don't go exactly how he wants. 
---
I had Warlock insult me in RFD for that. Haven't ran into Mages like that!
---
You keep on thinking that. If you‚Äôre leveling a class because you want to be able to force your preferences on other people at max level and feel like the most important person around, rather than because you enjoy that class or role, then you‚Äôre not the kind of person I, or many others wanna group with.
---
If you want to put groups together that minimize your competition, that‚Äôs your right as someone organizing the run. If you wanna message premade groups expecting the 4 others already there to accommodate your demands because of how you suffered so much leveling a tank, then you‚Äôre an ass.
---
Lucky bastard!
---
Even if a group is having a hard time I've found that it is 100% completely pointless to ever try CCing if there's a hunter in the party.
---
True story, that data is for the dungeon as a whole. The hunter in question pointed that out, at which point I posted the data for the current fight, and it had a single multishot usage (the one that broke the sheep).
---
He didn't have anything to say after that.
---
I would explain marketing to you, but I can see you are just insulting every other comment that disagrees with you, so I'll let you do your own research.
---
Probably not worth it. You're getting mostly Wool Cloth and low level greens and blues. You might scrape together 1g per run and with a 5 run per day limit, it's much more profitable to just do relevant level content.
---
I‚Äôm married with kids, work at a big law firm, and have kid sport events to go to on the weekend. 
---
I‚Äôm still 60 with an epic mount and practically full bis. You just get good at time management and prioritizing. Kids and children go to bed, I stay up for another 3-4 hours to work/play wow. I wake up early and go to the gym and get another couple hours of wow in. 
---
Thinking your busy life is holding you back and they‚Äôre only so far ahead because they‚Äôre no lifing it is complete bullshit.
---
U really need to finish your schooling kiddo
---
A couple days ago I had Auctioneer appraise everything in my bag and noticed that it had auto-filled an undercut price for some ore that was super low, so I went back and looked.
---
Someone had (probably very recently since it all had 24 hours left) posted some stacks of ore at a ridiculously low price. Like they just picked a price rather than checked and tried to undercut or used an AH add-on or whatever. 
---
So I bought it all and re-listed along with my stacks. Made a decent profit!
---
It's always a good idea to sort from lowest to highest buy-it-now price, even when using an add-on.  There might be a few listings that are low enough that you can buy them and get a good price for your stuff as well.
---
Farming Maraudon solo for about 100+ runs and flipping highly wanted AH items. :D
---
I occasionally use "++" to reply in the affirmative. Not sure why I started but i continued to do so because i liked the way it looked. 
---
Maybe its just an aesthetic thing.
---
Lvl 60 ganking stv feels like that one kid thats an asshole because hes parents beat him

McDonald's?

Literally just did this quest but didn't take the time to read the text. Makes me want to try to do that more often

Don't take downvotes personally.  This comment here will get downvoted into the abyss just  for fun.

Ah to be 13 again
---
I thought it starts at 50 no?
---
I got 17d15h played FeelsBadMan
---
Speed runners know the area layout and optimal pathing. Most normal people don't and it makes you prone to get gangbanged by some unlucky 3+ mob aggroing because you just stood on the wrong spot.
---
At least for Forsaken players because that starting area is just full of undead.... it was breath of fresh air when occasionally you got to kill humanoids... XD
---
Explain it to me then if u really know why I‚Äôm wrong...
---
A true God
---
I left my 60 warlock for the exact opposite reason. World pvp is a joke there. I went to faerlina. Not 60 yet, but it‚Äôs insane. Completely different with how much pvp there is.
---
Then dont group with people like me. It's literally that simple. Why are you so bothered by something that doesnt impact you at all?
---
Well damn.. any idea how a mage should do it? XD
---
Thanks OP. A question however: lots of guides are talking about 30/21 farming spec, but I don‚Äôt see any good deep feral guide for farming, because I guess it‚Äôs less efficient to farm mara as we don‚Äôt hVe insect swarm for the goblin, and quite a small mana pool for the princess.
---
Do you think of any good spot for a deep feral Druid?
---
it's the School of Necromancy = Scholomance
---
Sadly the people you're trying to reach are the people who care the least about empathy.
---
I used to hire myself out as a tank.  Super great way to make money
---
Honestly the only solution I could think of (even though it's far too late for that) is to show faction balance in-game.
---
I doubt anyone on a server with a heavily skewed faction balance went over there to be bullies, especially this early in Classic's life. Likely they just picked a server and a faction with their friends and just so happened to end up in the winning side.
---
But it's not up to them to not PvP so they don't scare anyone off.
---
99% of /r/wow
---
&gt; Threat is your job not mine
---
Then I‚Äôd let them die.
---
It was the polar opposite. PUGs were slow slow slow. You would sheep/sap every group and people would rage if they got extra mobs etc even if they had the mana/oomph to handle it. Cleave is better than that. I'd rather pop some CDs than yawn through it. Just avoid any "cleave" groups. They'll barely save you any time/effort.
---
There is none that I can tell when on game mode I‚Äôve done a few duels with my brother and I would of noticed
---
That‚Äôs literally a few days of grinding, what was so exhausting about questing?
---
Pedophilia jokes are not funny dude.
---
So out of curiosity what‚Äôs your rotation look like on a single target level 53-55 mob?
---
Yeah, and even that dwarf female too? She looks like a priest to me.
---
Chicken
---
I am first time playing and Barrens made me hate questing lol
---
For deep Feral (tank) i would reccomend you just run Strath live and reserve 1st orb on a round-robin loot distribution for the orbs.
---
People always need tanks for that place, it's really popular
---
Of course. Certain gear is needed to not be a waste of space when you are thinking of bwl, aq, naxx. It‚Äôs just part of the game to expect someone to be geared from the previous tier when working on the next.
---
You seem semi-salty about instances specifically. Short answer, yes. You can‚Äôt control how some people run a group. All you can do is have the gear they want or move on to the next. I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs how it‚Äôll be in any gear based, progression driven game.
---
What happened in vanilla is we all got good at teaming up and dominating larger populations of randoms.
---
We then got pvp ranks much quicker due to BG queues favoring us.
---
Cool nugs.
---
I bought it on 42 I think. I was hunter mostly grinding mobs/proffesions. After level 40 you get Gold from quests pretty fast :)
---
Hmm... Grind wise I'd say in SW Stonetalon Mountains (Harpies every where +cloth drops) or Hillsbrad Foothills.
---
For pvp gnome is best by far.  You also look super tough doing your cleaving pirouette on special attacks.
---
Several NPC's have little interactions like this.
---
Go ahead and /rude Mountaineer Pebblebitty once you get sick of dealing with her quests and attitude.
---
Netherwind \[NA-EAST\]\[PVP\] | Gummybeard Alliance lvl 36 - not willing to transfer
---
Having never played WOW before playing classic wow, my experience so far up to level 36. Has been a great especially the very beginning of the game, players were very social and talkative. People would help each other out and give others spare items.
---
Thus I was wondering is there a guild out there that I could join whose goal is to help starting players out. Either it be through donating of useful items like bags, armor kits, etc and passing them on to players near starting areas. Or by walking around and helping lower level players grind through. My experience in the beginning areas were so pleasant that I kinda wanna replicate this for others.
---
If there isn't one, I was wondering if anyone would be willing to create this guild with me? In addition, if there are feasibility issues you would like to point out with this guild like the longevity of new players flowing in reducing the activity of the the guild feel free to point them out. I kinda wanna join a guild, with an ultimate goal. Not just a guild with a random name like "boon bumpers" and 500+ members.
---
Is the pickpocket money loot table shared with the death loot table. Aka is pick pocketing coin a waste because when the mob dies it just has less coin
---
Thogg rping? 
---
Saw a troll constantly saying mon lol. Things i love about classic. I don't rp and imagine most don't, but ppl get a little more involved and minor RP in classic.
---
Hence, we play an rpg a little more even if we don't all out RP
---
...that‚Äôs not even a pedo joke, the fuck are you on about?
---
Server? I feel like I know that name
---
I honestly just started playing lol
---
Take a deep breath
---
It makes me laugh that comments on tanking in Classic are interchangeable with tanking in Overwatch.
---
Big up Anoz!! :D
---
fact
---
Caveat is it has to be under gold cap I think. They don‚Äôt enforce things over gold cap that otherwise require multiple transactions.
---
Y'all motherfuckers need Harmony.
---
It's up to you how you want to play, but as a warrior who does both, I won't ever invite you to any group that isn't a raid, and honestly you wouldn't be first choice there either... Raids require offtanks at times and if you can't be versatile, why should I pick you? 
---
It's just lazy to not have a tank gearset and tank when needed. You aren't using your character to the fullest ability. Buuuttttt... at the end of the day, you are paying for your sub and if that's how you want to spend your time, go ahead.
---
Uhhhh... no
---
What‚Äôs the appeal of having everything so stringy and spaced out? It looks like a nightmare. Use the 10 minutes to tighten up your ui.
---
Why does it bother people so much what others choose for themselves?
---
Yea,, bought Custodian for 50g, Warden staff dropped, and I have a glowing brightwood staff in the bank.
---
I found that once you hit iron in mining the money goes up. Tin only sells for 1s each but irons 10s and mithril is 14. And for skinning anything under thick leather the difference between vendor and ah prices is so minimal you might as well sell it and avoid the ah cut
---
Being that the terms of service is a legally binding agreement, and any legal system doesn't operate by ambiguous standards, if anything related to the ToS made it to a court of law it would use the one currently published on their website until Blizzard declares (and makes you agree) to a specific ToS for classic WoW.
---
Gear? I‚Äôm pre bis with some raid epics
---
The biggeat issue are the statistics of populations that are released. No sane person will join a server where their faction is in a minority and alot will change servers for it.
---
Take a guess why it got so bad on retail that youve got 20/80 ratios...
---
This . So much this. Thank you for articulating my thourghts so well when i couldn't myself. 
---
The need all BoE mentality is so antisocial
---
Do you click your spells...? Lmao
---
I really won‚Äôt because I already have everything bound lol
---
A lot of people don't know how economies work.
---
It's not. It's relative to other servers.
---
Hey, if you‚Äôve enjoyed yourself then why the fuck not. Just remember to look away from the screen at something far in the distance every now and then. For your eyes! üòÇ
---
The words don't mean anything. Blizzard said that it's just relative to the rest of the servers. So high/full now doesn't mean the same as high/full at launch.
---
I haven't had a queue on Pagle in weeks after having 2+ hour queues a week in. It definitely seems to be falling off. But I'm still enjoying myself. 56, just dropped 160g on devilsaur 2 set.
---
Come crying over social media about a ban? Come on dude you think this well get lifted from this?
---
I‚Äôd kill myself if I played with a trackpad because you‚Äôve clearly never heard of a mouse lmao 
---
Side buttons my guy. They‚Äôre amazing.
---
It doesnt matter how fast you progress. Endgame will be pvp aswell. (blackrock mountain)
---
The biggest issue is the balance statistics scaring of any new players or already progressed players. It will worsen the balance until weve hit a 100/0 ratio.
---
it hits your target plus two nearby targets, not everything in front
---
Do you see how quickly you have gone from trying to make a point to just hurling out insults?
---
Man, once you get past the Barrens, the world opens up a bit more and it gets better. Trust me.
---
My entire point was that if you can not corrupt to get nightfall procs, then it is a worse spec dps wise. You need to have nightfall procs and the corruption dps to be able to compete dps wise with a ruin build.  
---
I think my experience is completely normal for those that are raiding in guilds. In Phase 1, corruption is a lower priority debuff. World buffs have nothing to do with debuff slots.  
---
The simple fact is that if you are not corrupting, DS/Ruin will always beat out SM/DS in raiding. The 10% shadow damage from SM doesn‚Äôt even come close to competing with the 2.5 Sec SB cast rather than 3 Sec SB cast (17% dps increase from that alone) plus 50% more critical damage with probably around a 15% crit rating from Des Tree and Int even with bad gear and normal raid buffs (a huge increase that only gets better with gear).  
---
So, how does a 10% damage bonus compete with a 17% damage increase from cast time alone plus the huge crit benefits on top, because you will be getting atleast a few crits on a boss even with bad gear and no world buffs.
---
OK, thanks for the info. I'll hang on to mining. I checked leather scraps, light leather, etc vendor prices a little while back and the scraps were vendorable, but light leather and light hide was getting me a bit more cash on the AH, including the cut. But it might be worth looking again now that people have had a few weeks to level up.
---
OP‚Äôs account wasn‚Äôt compromised. 
---
OP‚Äôs story was that OP was in Europe, levelled (I assume from 1-60), mailed him and his brother a bunch of gold, and then came back to Canada. 
---
So blizzard is saying ‚Äòyeah, you definitely just paid someone to level for you.‚Äô And there‚Äôs probably additional evidence like OP logging in from home soon after the leveller logged off. I bet OP also has a story about how the blizzard launcher automatically opens and their roommate/wife/parents used their computer.
---
His attitude/personality &amp; his way of casting off every opinion he doesn‚Äôt agree with as idiotic or somehow not valid.
---
Like the EQ spell? Some hippy girl? Harmony who?
---
Ironforge city guards return salutes too!
---
Finally -- 2.5hours. Cute.
---
Even if I was clicking, this game is PVE. It‚Äôs not difficult lol. Especially as a mage.
---
&gt; Your Argent Dawn reputation has increased by 5.

The struggle is real.

As a newb to WoW could you explain this apparent horror to me?
---
Ok thanks for the tip!
---
Wait your laptops slow or do you somehow think you know what‚Äôs inside my desktop?
---
I didn‚Äôt say vanilla lol
---
There‚Äôs literally one quest from the flight point. Well, it has a follow up too. Which sends you to fucking thalanaar for some reason, which then chains into... nothing. There are no quests there. Despite thousand needles being an appropriate zone for players of that level range.
---
You find people for dungeons by being a healer or tanking. Patience is usually the key.
---
Personally, I‚Äôve only ran a few dungeons for the quests and if they didn‚Äôt have them, I‚Äôd make much more efficient use of time by questing/grinding. Sounds like people are just wanting to level.
---
For fucks sake
---
Sometimes people just chill.
---
just make sure you scan frequently and build your database!
---
For real,  tell your friends, get your family addicted.

Hinterlands are an amazing leveling area during 40-50. You also still got quite a few STV quests left.
---
Are single faction(the higher one) xfers a thing? Making it so the lesser population would have to reroll to leave could deter them while the higher population can xfer to more balanced servers, naturally the amount permitted to xfer would be closely monitored to prevent massive imbalance and overpopulation on the servers they xfer to.
---
I love this and want more.
---
Gehannas is the obvious answer. All the other realms remvoved their queue simulator for some reason. Not sure why

Please, I'm a lock and want to be this one day (whatever it is)

No dude, he also eats babies.
---
You do it from the twitch app
---
Yes I played Vanilla to Wrath. You are literally making the argument for keeping layers. Keeping layers is how you can have a server drop in population by 50% and still have the zones feel just as populated. Having layers is how Blizzard is able to have big servers that won't die off, yet still maintaining the same zone density to actual vanilla. If you drop layers, one of those two things will no longer be true. Do you see the tradeoff?
---
Lol fuk da horde
---
that girl that did that wins the internet. she gets it.
---
I use a couple seperate addons that tell me vendor price and if I scan the ah before going out updated ah prices. Mileage may vary depending on server.
---
&gt; Gold supply aside, the number of devilsaurs and thorium veins is static while the % of the population hitting 60 is going to keep growing.
---
But the number of people who are actively buying devilsaur/crystals is relatively static too. Just because you had 5 60's last week and 10 60's this week doesn't mean the number of people wanting to purchase devilsaur this week doubled. People that have been 60 already have devilsaur.
---
Lmao that's funny. You seem to be the one picking and choosing which parts of the dialogue you want to read. Layering does not affect the PHYSICAL limitations of the servers. Realms with long wait times to get in will continue to have those long waits regardless of how many layers a server can utilize. You're not waiting in queue because the main city doesnt have enough layers to support all the players. You're sitting in queue because the server itself is at its limit. And you call me dense....
---
You just want as much int as you can and stam secondary for safety. If you have remotely decent gear, the bigger factor on your ability to AoE farm will be your own ability (and server congestion).
---
Beggars can not be choosers
---
One guy using multiple machines and running multiple accounts controlled by 1 keyboard and mouse all casting the same spells on 1 Target. Massive dmg.
---
I'll give these all a try but I'm playing on a relatively small keyboard and struggle with ctrl as a modifier, very impressive though! 1 question; is it possible to make a macro that checks if you have sword and board equipped, if so cast shield bash and if no shield switch to zerker and use pummel?
---
People don't want balanced teams, people want stacked teams and to be on said stacked team.
---
You are trying to stop a stampede with a stop sign.
---
-cheers
---
Dude it‚Äôs in your display settings you need to change the hz from 30 what it‚Äôs on right now to 60hz message me if you need help finding it but just google it it‚Äôs easy enough
---
Basically one guy has 4+ warlocks he‚Äôs controlling and they all do the same thing. So if you go near him, you instantly get 4 corruptions and 4 agony and 4 siphon life. And suddenly you‚Äôre taking 3k damage every second. 
---
Or they just all cast shadow bolt and one shot you.
---
Sadly, people will run out of content before this year is over.
---
What‚Äôs up with the limited amount of servers are there new ones coming?  I wanted to make my first character on a newer server but there are only 5 that aren‚Äôt High or Full and those 5 are already medium.   Medium is probably fine still a lot of new players to quest with right?
---
Make a bank alt (all the level 1's in big cities), that you can use both as a bank and access to your real new bank: mail.
---
Anytime you go by a mailbox mail your extra consumables, leather, herbs, whatever to your bank alt.
---
&gt; Is there some sort of add-on that can help me with this?
---
I use auctioneer, it stores average AH prices, and puts it on the tooltip.
---
Holy shit that's brilliant. Gotta do this.
---
Yeah &amp; I‚Äôm not proud of it. Shame on me &amp; my sadistic behavior :(
---
I lol‚Äôd irl
---
I wasnt refering to playing past lvl 40,mail is still more expensive than leather and cloth and you are still trying to get gold for your mount while having a hard time leveling.Also even if you dont die ,taking damage reduce durability and warrior do a kot of taking dmg
---
I expect nothing, especially if I can skill up.
---
Yes, holy isn't needed basically until you're 60.
---
And the DPS obviously don't know how to play a priest, you only put shields on a tank in the direst of circumstances, had he shielded you you'd have no rage to actually tank.
---
Looks like my recount is broken lmao. More likely using gnome sequencer or boting and had no clue how to disable it.
---
As a rogue, I pickpocket EVERYTHING.  I'm only level 32, but the cash definitely helps.
---
Duskwood is a thing now? This a poor attempt to copy the almighty Horde The Barrens chat.
---
Shielding you kills your  rage generation. Which would make it harder for you to maintain threat, I only use it as a last resort. I would say he most likely wasn‚Äôt using the correct rank heals...either he hadn‚Äôt updated his bars or trained the newer ranks. I healed AOE cath runs at 35. Maybe he just sucked? But being Shadow wasn‚Äôt the problem
---
Everyone should need it.  If the winner wants to give it to someone, then they can.  Otherwise they can sell it and buy their own boe. (This is assuming the drop isn‚Äôt worthless).  If 100 straight gold dropped would it make sense for the guy with no mount at 50 throwing a pity party to get it over anyone else? If not then it is irrelevant if it is an upgrade or not.  In my opinion players being bad at the game is not an excuse to get free stuff.
---
I'm only level 40, but I like rogues. Less squishy than mages and they tend to top dps charts. 
---
I never thought of it though-  you are probably right if I had a choice between a shaman, mage, or lock of equal level I would choose one of those before the rogue . Each has so many party benefits .
---
Maybe because you stayed in barnes well into your 20s? You should have moved on to other areas at like 22
---
That's exactly what it is.
---
*SPLAT
---
3-4 stacks of water for a single dungeon is normal for a mage in a dungeon, you have to drink every opportunity you get
---
Auctioneer can tell you how much items are listed if you scan the AH regularly, you can keep a low level alt parked at the AH for the scan then you can see the info on any char on the same realm.
---
Note that the addon only tells you for how much people list stuff, there's no way to know if those items actually sell for that price.
---
It's also very useful when you buy, because it compares current prices with average market prices.
---
Medium is perfect! If the population is low, you won't be able to find people to play with half the time.
---
No.  Shadow is strictly a DPS spec.  My guess is that priest is a kid or just really stupid.
---
As long as you are on the Internet - Yes :D
---
Level 14 warlock.  I‚Äôve been zone jumping pretty heavily between loch Modan and Westfall.  I haven‚Äôt been doing any of the Elf zones though.  Am I missing out big time or am I good
---
He‚Äôs an idiot, shield is a spell, not a talent.
---
I leaved Barrens until late 24 and hit mid 26 when i finished Stonetalon Mountains.
---
Level 29 and only has 5 gold? 
---
That's not a red flag at all. :-)
---
Yeah you're dense as fuck. Literally aren't reading at all. Like I said, this entire thing was proven when Asmongold crashed the server by crashing a layer when they tried to squeeze a fraction of people into a layer. It DOESN'T WORK. Logic is so damn hard.
---
Shadow is fine, the difference is minimal. I heal both dungeons and raids as shadow as i dont want to respec every week for 3 hours. Current content is not hard enough to warrant it.
---
How you get that stream window in the wow window?
---
depends on how retarded people are, content wise it should not require it though.
---
Which leatherworking specialization should I choose? I am a rogue, hoping to use gear that I craft with money making being secondary.
---
The pro-choice boys must love that üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I imagine it‚Äôs Eastern Europe. Blizzard probably has a lot of problems with that area and boosting. Log on in Eastern Europe then log on in US a few hours later? Probably boosted.
---
Shadow is fine for dungeons. But holy or disc is easier. Still the healers job to keep the tank alive though. It's not like you're supposed to use pots the whole time.
---
Do you recommend Felwood or Un'goro for a Lvl 51?
---
https://youtu.be/2C3rJ2eJhP4
---
Here ya go man, happy grinding!
---
It‚Äôs there in settings somewhere not home or I‚Äôd look think under party maybe
---
Right back at you. Maybe don't attack people upvoting your post and liking your picture the next time. Annoying asshole.
---
That's why when they cut the raids down to 25, the amount of tanks stayed the same. 4-5 tanks for a 25-man raid is essentially 1 in 5 as needed for 5-man content. There has never been a tank drought in TBC or WOTLK. And then designers reverted to their old proportion and started to require 2 tanks tops for a 25-man raid.
---
ah, good ol' Hamburger Hillsbrad
---
How do you know their lives are miserable? How do you know they are even capable of experiencing misery? Misery is a human construct and you're personifying humanlike qualities on an animal that clearly doesn't have a brain that's sophisticated enough to have those qualities.
---
Looks more like Canadian warrior
---
They considered enough for most dungeons, assuming the levels/gear for the rest of the group is not below average. If the tank is undergeared or lower level for dungeon it becomes more appearent, but generally Spreist is enough

Not efficient to be able to farm herbs/thorium on a fresh server where nobody else has their epic mount?
---
Wrong, mate.
---
It's very efficient.
---
I ended up going Undead, WoTF was too nice to pass up on
---
It's considered bis for threat generation whereas other trinkets are for mitigation. It dropped again for me twice last night and I took the second one after my rogue friend, so I am using it now.
---
Blackfathom deep
---
Personally I follow Joana's horde leveling guide and it has made questing incredibly fun. And you save days of playtime to 60
---
It‚Äôs an amazing addon that monitors the market and allows you to set formulas for posting products on the AH.
---
Moreso than Auctioneer and the like, it let‚Äôs you set things like:
---
‚ÄúIf the threshold for runecloth isn‚Äôt X, then don‚Äôt post.  If people are posting at this price, set at this price.‚Äù
---
Really let‚Äôs you refine posting to match your logic for posting so all you have to do is set a button like scroll wheel and spin that baby to post all your supply.
---
Really amazing tool!
---
Keep in mind that those population statuses aren't static, they change over the course of the day and week. So if you're getting on on a Saturday then that's when everyone else is on so all the server population levels are going to reflect that, but on a weekday morning they will have much less.
---
Yea that's another reason I have such a long /played time. My Mage is 225 Engineering, my Rogue is 215 leatherworking and 215 skinning and my warrior has nothing of value beyond 260 first aid. 
---
Currently 50 Herbalism and 50 Alchemy on my Druid.
---
Props for going to this length.
---
If you say so...  Keep beeing the kind nice guy you are and you will make many friends!  Have fun.
---
Hit 41 and still only have 30G.
---
Picked up enchanting though so lost a lot of vendor gold :(
---
Yup don't bother, he's probably like this with everyone and it will backlash on his player reputation.
---
Put him on ignore to remember him if you switch guild and he tries to get in. If you're tank or heal you can even use this memo to get him out of a group if he's invited by the leader. Vanilla is also about being a decent human being, let him learn this by himself.
---
Not at all this is a expensive tv not one of those RCA pieces of junk it plays full 60 FPS no imputlag
---
Yeah I've already done MC. Finding a raid as Fury warrior is literally the easiest part. And no one expects a fully geared fury warrior to tank Raids. It's great.
---
I did not know this. Thank you.
---
Good job censoring
---
Its nog relative to other servers. That's what IT used to be. They changed IT about two weeks ago.
---
Legion had a mechanic where every class got a unique ability and class hall but the overall class design itself was very much homogenized. The talent free system which admittedly is a MoP thing and the ability prune made everyone more or less the same baseline class in an attempt to allow players to play whatever they want and succeed. The Legion design was granting classes temporary uniqueness through artifacts and legendaries which is problematic, because moving forward the skeleton of every spec was still pretty bland. And as you said when we lost those things in BfA we ended up realizing that making a class feel unique only through expansion specific mechanics is a bad idea. The heart of the classes should be vastly different fundamentally, and then they can introduce gear and items that allow you to level the playing field. Blizzard went the opposite way about it, making every class capable of the same things and trying to introduce uniqueness through items.
---
Yes; have you had the bug where your melee weapon is your quiver. (Model glitch)
---
You know jaina wants to try her first fat orc cock.
---
Isn't it illegal charging for an add-on in wow?
---
Shaman is usually considered the hardest thanks to totem management, plus you don't just spam chain heal. You have three different heals of which you need to use different ranks of all depending on situation.
---
It has very nice leggings as a quest reward. As Horde the quest is called Rig Wars.
---
Depends on the class. Personally I prefer ungoro but you may end up fighting a few mobs 3-4 levels above you on some of the quests. Felwood is a bit easier at the start as some of the early quests have you kill things in the 48-53 lvl range (like the furbolg quests in the south - they‚Äôre 48-51). There‚Äôs just more quests in ungoro.
---
Just unlocked Tiger's Fury. Do I really just use it every 6 seconds? Or should I be trying to combo it with Shred and other things? I already feel a bit energy starved, so getting a button that's essentially, "you need to spend 30 energy every 6 seconds to maintain this buff" is a bit of a bummer.
---
Release spirit
---
Instead of calling me a moron, how about you actually try to explain where I went wrong with my example?
---
It's kinda sad. I can be as respectful, ask what I'm doing wrong, and all your replies will still be of the same caliber. "wrong, ur a moron"
---
My first way back when was a hunter, and that's what I rolled here. 
---
I like being able to pick a certain pet, and it's a fun mini-game trying to minimize aggro and let the pet do the work. But I also like the lazy-mode method for killing something: mark the target, start aimed shot, send in the pet, Growl's taunt takes hold, aimed shot fires off, start shooting away.
---
The various tracking abilities are nice, too.
---
And for someone who solos a lot, it's just sort of comfortable having a pet out there with you as you're trudging around.
---
Might wanna look into blacksmithing/mining too, it‚Äôs fun
---
Fuck BIS . This word is a bane on the classic experience. Y'all talking biS and it don't even matter.
---
Sagefish delight is the one they‚Äôre talking about for mana.  Can get alliance side.
---
For some relatively easily replaceable cloth you now got rid of a d bag. I say that‚Äôs a win, move on.
---
Just reassuring everyone that he's safe.
---
Ehhh, there‚Äôs a difference in trying to appear like your message is about being nice and kind but basically berate people for not having the same view as you when it comes to raiding. 
---
Follow your own advice, let people ask for what they want. Move on if they don‚Äôt like wasting time with scrubs.
---
I've been leveling with somebody and they havent been around the past couple days.  So I spent my time leveling fishing and cooking.
---
Fishing the coast of STV has netted me somewhere in the 100-110g range currently with a handful of more auctions pending
---
It looks very good but is 37 dollar. :( I cant afford that, dollar is extremely expensive in where i live.
---
you are gonna have a bad time here
---
I'll be doing the opposite, troll grinding for that sweet undead epic mount! Now if only I could get Rivendare's to drop again, that would be perfect!
---
Not to mention the boring dailies dude. The vast majority of them are time sinks, and you need a real combination of luck and skill to get one that actually has good RoI.
---
Oh god that sounds scary
---
Not with my tv and computer
---
Thank you so much for doing this. I am way to lazy of a person to do it
---
Prolly jumped and died in midair. Happened to be just over part of the trees base lol
---
Probably gonna do Blacksmithing when I start up a paladin. 
---
[Too many alts!](https://i.imgur.com/aaro9aF.jpg).
---
My only answer to beggars is "I'm poor too". Prot war 60 is always poor, we got to grind resist stuff, reputations, repairs, Epic BoE for Def cap, Epic mount...
---
No I do not have 1G.
---
Don't tease.
---
Then don't bring them along and find a different tank. If you don't find value in something then don't buy it. It really is that simple. 
---
If other people find value in something and that price becomes the norm, then maybe you're the one with the shit attitude thinking you should get something for free. This applies to any good or service.
---
He hit 30k subs like 3 days ago. With standard 50k viewers id say that's extremely good.
---
Goblins and gnomes, 
---
Both are super brilliant! 
---
But you would never know. 
---
Everything they seem to make is faulty or explooOOdes. 
---
Perfecting imperfection, goblins and gnomes!
---
Sound boring.
---
10 days would be 240 hours. At 8 hours per week, that would be 30 weeks.
---
Ehh. I've seen one person RP in the past 3 weeks. Grobb is probably the weakest RP server I've -ever- been on in -any- mmo period. No one RPs, you run by people like "pocketlock" "yourblackmom" "hunniehuntr" "shadowx" and "lryjnkns" pretty much 50/50
---
It's just a PVP server as far as I'm concerned. Delete the Stormwind guard and that one dwarf only guild and you basically removed all RP from Grobb ally side.
---
&gt;You're also terribly cherry picking with your quotes. Let's reinsert the part of that 2nd quote you left off. There's more to do now than there was before I was 60.
---
I think you might wanna read that again. At no point do you have more content at 60 than before 60 (well, maybe before lvl 10 or so).
---
That was for Slurms Mackenzie rip
---
This is quality content
---
Oh Im well aware that Reddit is full of garbage humans I'll have a fine time here watching the idiocy you guys try to post so far it's been pretty pathetic. Not even the usual idiots trying to be funny just some real obvious hate that wasn't even well thought out. Keep it coming :)
---
Hey is blind ok in dungeons?
---
Also, Scholomance was the school, the town itself is called Caer Darrow after the Isle of Darrow where it stands.
---
It‚Äôs a dps gain even on a single target.
---
Mascara &gt; Rouge
---
This is why my gnomes always go goblin engineering.
---
It's a 4 second cast, and does ~1200 damage non crit. i'm not saying it's viable for long raid fights, i'm talking about dungeon bosses bro. chill out.
---
Even then the challenge of Mythic+ and Mythic raids lasts a couple months tops. With how easy it is to get geared and how little else you need to prepare, all players are basically as geared as top guilds a month or so into the patch cycle. You don‚Äôt look at players in top guilds and think, wow this guy‚Äôs items are so cool. You have the same items more or less and the couple of things he has better are sockets on gear he randomly got lucky with. 
---
So you end up with a game where doing the hard content is really hard for a short period of time until we all catch up, and then it‚Äôs mostly people who can do content that gives you almost no actual benefit to your power level, like being able to do a +25 vs a +18. There is almost no appeal to dedicating yourself to do such high keys because the rewards vs time is not there. You would only really do it for pride, and a lot of people aren‚Äôt incentivized to grind the time for virtually nothing but bragging rights.
---
GTX 1070 TI founders edition. I do recall seeing a driver update so possibly the issue. Kept all my settings the same though which is why it‚Äôs so odd!
---
Don't use it unless you're running yo an enemy and have full energy. Like you spend 30,regen 20,engage. 10 energy tigers fury for 4s after running to the mob.
---
That angle looks silly.
---
In all the years I played wow, I just did two 180¬∞ turns real fast an a forward jump in between to kite a mob. Pressing a strafe key never occured to me O_o`

I'd rather have the name and throw him on the avoid list.

You try paint remover?

How fucking dare you?

I always thought he was saying ‚Äúsomething me doing?‚Äù  Sounds more orc-y to me I think
---
So you exploited layering mechanism to get BT? Got it. I am really happy you got fucked over, layer hoppers are scum.
---
Right you are! The hunter in question pointed that out, at which point I posted the current fight data, which also had multi-shot in it. He got pretty quiet after that.
---
I've smashed so many alliance in SV
---
It actually rolls a lot more digits than what is shown.  10.2416932 vs. 10.6745199.   Both show as 10, but one obvious winner.
---
Ya that
---
You forgot btw btw
---
But this is just what many redditors do on a daily basis to feel better.  :-D
---
Multishot hits three targets max for weapon damage plus a bonus. It‚Äôs one of only four possible ranged abilities hunters get and one of only two that will do more damage than your base autoshot. It is a dps gain on single targets but a mana sponge.
---
If I remember correctly thrash blade should be in your main hand always because it has the chance to proc an additional attack and all your attacks have a chance to trigged the proc.
---
I mean....the leveling process takes a long time and there is no way to really  bypass it. If you want to speed it up then get a good organised group and run dungeons as a tank to 60 but otherwise, it's a slow process
---
One of my pet peeves: When someone claims that "people are saying" some random bullshit.
---
Only level it when it has rested exp then...dont know how to respond when someone asks how to level something but doesn't have the time to level it...
---
And tanks are more deserving simply because no body wants to play them. If you find the job of tanking fun then good for you, you get to dictate how things go because of your scarcity. If things get bad enough in favor of the tanks then the market will correct itself when more people roll tanks. Don't like it? Make a tank or get comfortable with the game flows.
---
And for the record I tank and don't do any of this shit. But I do choose the groups I join based off of competition, because I have the power to do that just like everyone else does.
---
that's what's called a "faceplant"
---
The best place to find groups for sm is on sm, there's no point in going to cities to LFM since everyone goes there and you want groups formed asap.
---
&gt; Rly can‚Äôt afford the time to quest etc  
---
Then why make an alt at all? That doesn't make any sense.
---
We Tauren are a very simple people.
---
Hmm... we did the full UD run, but we must have missed him :/ Thanks for the info tho.
---
I liked Alchemy/Herbalism for levelling. A rogue has a bunch of tools that allow them to get out of a tight spot. Same is true for potions. It gives you extra options at the click of a button.
---
Constructive criticism? Okay:
---
- Don't create a topic about some random bullshit and claim that "people say it".
---
- Use your print screen key.
---
Yep, abusing layers to gain advanteage over others is very disrespectufl. Thankfully someone fixed that by killing both OP and BT.
---
This guy runs 5mans. 
---
Follow this advice, and you‚Äôll have a much easier time getting a group together.
---
Congratz! Best of luck! I found most of my bloods in WPL rather than EPL. Seemed like they had a better respawn.
---
I didn't think he was gonna potion lol
---
Yep, that's an old school trick. My movement keys are WER, using forward, turn right and turn left. You can strafe with turn keys if you're simultaneously using mouse turn - turn keys are more useful when using autorun. It moves your hand inward a row, so your pinky has two quick access keys, Q &amp; A, and tab right there. I also have completely removed and disabled the CapsLock and Windows keys from old keyboards.
---
The one on the left is an Axe and you are an orc. The one on the right is a mace and you are an orc. weapon skills effect these numbers
---
Doesn't really make sense considering the servers still have queues after a month
---
Paladin, but as you are Horde, Priest?
---
PRINT SCREEN
---
It's not that hard

See ya out there ;)
---
Druid. Just use rank 4 healing touch
---
This is awesome to know. I've run princess runs a thousand times for the ring. I'll just skip it and come back later
---
Darkshore has incredibly high quest density, and it s not too much running back and forth. I moved there at level 14 and it‚Äôs been a quick ride to 19. 
---
It‚Äôs quite a cool aesthetic too.
---
Only downsides are the run over there through the wetlands and that you have to go back to SW/IF for class training. But it‚Äôs not too bad a journey once you‚Äôve been there once and picked up the flight paths.
---
I can't remember does gnomish world enlarger stack with that?
---
You'll start getting +spellpower gear in your level range. With the +10% crit and +10% damage from talents.
---
If I have full mana I'll go holy fire-mind blast-smite till they're dead. Half mana or less use shadow word pain and wand instead of spamming smite. If you finish the last 50% of an enemy with swp/wanding your mana regen will kick in before it's dead.
---
Rlly depends on ur gear, ur rotation is good.
---
Lol everyone that is bitching at OP is either playing on a PVE server or one of those people that play on  PVP server and cry when they get killed.
---
Hey I completely feel you on this. I got a warrior to lvl 50, and this bothered me so much I rerolled a mage. I don‚Äôt like tanking but even when I join as dps I always end up tanking. Dps spec and only an average tank so when things go bad it‚Äôs instantly my fault. Really put a damper on gameplay so I switched classes! Play how you want brotha, but it gets worse as you get higher up
---
Yes grenades can be thrown while moving, and this is why everyone is using them in pvp instead of bomb.
---
Especially since I make a lot more exp in dungeons. On good quests I make the same exp that I make on a mediocre dungeon run. If I play at 3 am and have barely any PvP happening. If I play at main times I make less than on a bad dungeon run.
---
You're on the "blow me" server?
---
No you use totems.
---
If your smart and your group expect it yes, a rogue can quickly cc multiple mobs, gouge one, blind another, quick cp gen and stun third. 
---
Blind break on dmg exactly like sheep and has a decent range

This post won't do anything. No single person ganking 1 or 2 people a day thinks they are killing the enemy faction too much. But when that's the 20th time today someone did that, the person dying will have had enough of it. That's the problem. There is no solution besides telling the majority faction "don't PvP at all" but that's the same end result whether all the enemy faction leaves or not.
---
Thanks for the reply! Love he setup. How big is your tv?
---
I‚Äôm confused. Are you asking how to level an alt without taking the time to leve an alt?
---
Bro just have a warrior pummel her when she goes for the heal.
---
War and I tanked often
---
What a time to be alive.
---
You have an interesting definition of difficulty when it includes ‚Äòfarming consumes.‚Äô 
---
Retail mythic raiding is expensive. Raiders can easily drop 1k per pull or 60k/week. 
---
But no one talks about that when they say that mythic raiding is hard. They talk about how tough the fights are to execute as a group. 
---
The difficulty there lies in 300+ pulls to be able to execute the fight, whereas the difficulty in vanilla is farming the 300 potions to pop on your way to KT. Very different forms of difficulty.
---
I have a 60 rogue and power leveled a warrior to 35 via dungeons in a few days of play. You can probably do it even more efficiently on a mage if you know how to aoe farm.
---
I leveled my warr to 10, then did RFC till 16 ish, then went to wc till 23 ish, then did sfk to 28 then did Sm till 35.
---
35 is when I hit a roadblock though and doing armory is incredibly inefficient for the experience I get. I would say you as a mage should be able to power level a character to 40 though if you can solo Sm cath efficiently.
---
Hit then crit then strength.
---
Personally I went back and forth between grinding and questing. Grinding is nice in that you can kinda go on autopilot. Questing can be frustrating when you are running around trying to get mob tags or item spawns and it just feels like you aren't making any progress.
---
Also, there is no reason to believe there might not be more balance patches in the future.
---
With a tank knowing how to mitigate damage correctly the Healers gets plenty of additional time to get his mana back up
---
Frost brand has the lowest dps, and doesn‚Äôt benefit from many talents, making it equally less versatile as it is bad for dps.
---
Flametongue has the highest dps because it reaches minimum dps at an attack speed slower than the average dagger, meaning there‚Äôs no difference in actual on-hit damage from a 1.2 dagger to a 1.7 dagger, so you‚Äôre hitting more frequently for the same amount of damage per hit. 
---
Rockbiter isn‚Äôt bad by any means, it‚Äôs just only good for averaging your dps. It /can/ do more damage than windfury, but it can also do a fraction of the damage. Against anything that has decent armour, it‚Äôs the worst since it goes off of a flat AP increase.
---
Flametongue on the other hand does more dps than both, with a considerable lead when specced ele prime, and will retain that dps lead unless you‚Äôre fighting mobs with high fire resist, which is uncommon outside of MC (and even then, you won‚Äôt be using rockbiter in MC at all). Flametongue also benefits from a higher critical chance, as well as essentially gaining 2.33* for every 1 spellpower, as opposed to rockbiter not gaining any benefits from stats and just being a flat buff to your normal melee swing.
---
Aight guys really appreciate the feedback will do!!! Reddit community &lt;3
---
You. You. You. You. You. 
---
This isn‚Äôt even about me, stop projecting weird stuff onto me and missing the point. I don‚Äôt give a fuck how anyone chooses to spend their wow time. You shouldn‚Äôt either. 
---
Such a narrow minded view of the world where you clearly have the superior views and everyone else should do exactly what you want. Keep dreaming, kid. That‚Äôs the ‚Äòaltruism‚Äô. It‚Äôs not sad you don‚Äôt know me, it‚Äôs great that people are strangers.
---
Map in the center is pointless clutter imo.  The center is for information pertaining to quick Combat and abilities in the moment. Rest is fine.
---
Yes, you can make some nice stuff like the shadoweave pieces around level 40 or dreamweave or the robe of power.
---
If you want to min max your character you will also eventually want to craft the robe of the void which requires tailoring so it's nice to already be a tailor when you get to max level. I'm currently level 52 and already working on that robe, will most likely be able to craft it straight away at level 57.
---
It's probably not the most efficient way to level but I like crafting and having food gear for my level at all times is fun to me so I really enjoy this playstyle.
---
At end game, paladin.  You stack crit and spam one spell.
---
Priests can be easy but they have the biggest tool kit of all the healing classes.  And at end game, you have to downgrade appropriately to ensure the group doesn't die to damage or you going oom.
---
Right, but 3-4 hours on average per day isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúton‚Äù of free time. And you don‚Äôt need 5 days /played to reach 52.
---
Oh look, another "O look another 'my fp was blocked' post, how original" post, how original.
---
Dont buy every rank up, please, just dont! 
---
Skills that SEEM good but in reality aren't needed are Rend, Overpower, shield bash, tclap are the ones that pop to my head immediately.
---
Honestly, shit that is prolly worth it is HS until around 34-36 I think it is, then you might as well just wait for Bloodthirst or Mortal Strike, depending on which build you are leveling with, Hamstring, Sunder Armor and imo Battle Shout. I guess battle shout CAN be negotiable, but I feel it's prolly worth it.
---
Everything else is either not bought or just kept at rank 1. And yes, even with imp overpower talented, ranking up OP isn't worth it, the extra damage is neglible at best whilst lvling.
---
Not even full, dead game Kappa.
---
A massive part of your damage is going to be hit rating, so even if you have some BiS gear, if you don‚Äôt have the right gear with hit rating, your damage and rage generation is going to suck.
---
Also good weapons are a must.
---
If you were under-leveled for the beginning portion of the dungeon, then you were very low leveled for the end. When you are in the final straight to the boss, even if you are perfectly leveled, it is possible to pull mobs from the middle that aggro everything else in that middle spot. Usual tactic is to hug the wall, but if you are too low, you'll aggro anyway.
---
Besides this it's very situational...  Multi target or boss dmg what exact boss.  Sometimes ranged classes have advantages sometimes other classes just pike in your current content.  Warriors will keep scaling with every item coming.  If you think you are doing something wrong in terms of clicking the right buttons try to watch videos it's usually easier to understand what they are doing and may be adopt things.
---
Bro you‚Äôre the one posting about steroids go grow your bussy and leave real men alone
---
wowhead has a search tool you can sort by where things drop and how much int.
---
Tanaris is way worse then STV
---
Sounds like this rogue the other day who thought he was being sneaky, unlocked/looted a pattern from a chest off to the side while we were focused on a random pull, then proceeded to say all he had seen in the chest was some materials for crafting. I was like, you know we can see who gets what loot right? Crickets.
---
Y‚Äôall are twisting it, I was asking if like I have a lvl 60 friend will it be possible for him to just nuke everything I tag to speed things up? I just don‚Äôt want to quest
---
Yeah faithofhonor did a good job there, fair play
---
5 manning isn‚Äôt really a problem. When you run into good tanks and healers while leveling/doing dungeons just make friends with them. What sucks is competing against 20+ other casters for 1-2 caster drops in MC a week and then a handful of locks for the tier sets.
---
Im pretty sure with all the maraudon farming that is going on, having someone summon you to Desolace would be lucrative.
---
Yeah, sounds like you probably should‚Äôve been a rogue. You should find a couple bear tank friends.
---
The picking order.
---
I actually have a guildie ready to craft it for me, just never did anything about it as I wouldn't have the mana to use it anyways. That's gonna change due to this post ;)
---
Barrens chat was resurrected,  classic is live my friend. Go endulge.
---
Whaa whaa a multi shot broke my sheep so I‚Äôm going to post on Reddit whilst incorrectly describing what multi shot actually does and showing an overall dps report. And then people ask for names for their ignore lists lmfao. Literally everything that is wrong with today‚Äôs gamers.
---
Man, you got fucking triggered.  Since where in my statement am I bitching?  I just notice when I'm listing auctions I see listings all under-cutting each other by 1s down the list.  
---
I'm doing perfectly fine with my auctions.  But having more and more people reaching 60 + easier listing/undercuts does make for a market that has lower market value for items.

My friend, GeForce got new function, you can turn up game sharpness and clarity, with just 15% its beautiful!
---
Hybrid I run with h a majority of my points in holy but branched into disc and shadow for spirit tap. Dungeon grinding you won't need spirit or wand but it's super helpful if your solo questing I never stop to drink.
---
Oh I did, believe me. That's why you can still see the /cheer emote from my chat and why I started to do /question to the shaman before actually attacking back.
---
Bro gkick people like this. Dude doesn't need RC bogs at 29.
---
Bears stack a shitton of agi, so they always compete against DPS warriors and rogues all the time.
---
Didn't get to the side, tail swiped into a tree.
---
The gankers have been a minority on my pvp realm, they were rogues or hunters +10 of my level but for me, if i can easly kill alliance i dont even mind of start a fight, there is no challenge at all so no fun for me. Usually im questing with a friend so 2vs1 is a dishonorable action for my warrior, if i meet with someone of my level i ask my friend to not heal me and wait for the enemy to get full hp or kill the mobs  to attack.
---
Says right in the screenshot, AHDB. :)
---
Theres a chicken in the shimmering flats racetrack who turns into a man and clucks at you if you do /chicken on him

Jobs done
---
Humar was my first rare that I camped back in retail.  Took me quite a bit longer than 2.5 hours for me to get him....gratz!
---
Question on +healing spells.  I'm a priest who plays as holy...does +healing spell stat effect offensive holy spells or is it just healing spells?
---
Hillsbrad is to horde as stv is to alliance
---
What gives weapon damage?
---
I don‚Äôt get roid rage unlike you bro pop some estrogen and get fucked
---
I could scrape it together at 41.
---
First off, I'm a War and I tanked often so I don't think that i'm an ignorant dps . Also I agree with you, if both healer and tank aren't efficient then you will be slower trying to rush things. And this post is about that, I think most people coming here to complain aren't efficient OR do not know how to play their class properly.
---
Also I've never been kicked from any group and I'm not throwing rocks at people not willing to be as efficient as possible but I'm just tired about all those complaint.
---
Get good, talk to your group and that's the recipe for success.
---
Job's done
---
Wait what they do? So I don't have to scan the ah manually? If so, holy shit yes.
---
Auctionator doesn't default undercut by 1c, I know this because I had to go in and adjust the auto list discount and under-cut.  So, it is an issue where the default settings under-cut too much when it should just be 1c on everything.
---
Tank: why did I die
---
Healer: you realize I can't heal while silenced right? That's why I said "Silence" but you didn't drink a pot so... you died.
---
Consumables, Rep grinds, BiS, professions, Twinks.
---
Buy a gun fyi. It helps a lot at pulling agro.
---
Kind of sounds like to me you want to dictate how someone else plays the game.
---
The same thing a tank is doing when he does whatever made up scenario you're talking about, which I've literally never heard of happening anywhere other than this conversation. 
---
If someone has a shitty attitude then move on and play with someone else. You don't get to decide what is or isn't worth someone else's time.
---
Also you pay for the guide and the addon comes with it.
---
Did 10 hours of farming yesterday since posting...nothing.
---
Afaik mages are the fastest class also without aoe spots in open world.
---
There is a reason why spell aoe ex farming groups are so popular.
---
I'm currently levelling up Humar, but I tamed him at 60 and it's a really pain in the butt levelling him up. I need to get him to about 45-50 and I can start taking him to late game dungeons where he won't accidentally aggro everything in the instance.
---
Never got replaced since as a War I'm tanking/offtanking 90% of the Time.
---
How do I get flight paths.  I haven‚Äôt figured that out yet
---
Yep, when people just blind list items, it gets crazy.  There's a default 5% discount it puts for the bid price on items and it makes a lot of items go up for less than vendor.  A real easy way to make easy money putting bids on AH items.  Same even goes for BoE items that have a huge buyout but the bid is at a reasonable price as well.
---
Sounds like you just don't like rogues? Your points are not valid.
---
Most importantly, it was really cheap!
---
How do people play with UIs like this?
---
Giving me anxiety lol
---
&gt;I dont remember back in vanilla ever throwing blessing of protection or lay on hands in someone only for the animation and cooldown to go off and nothing to happen. 
---
This is exactly what would happen with 50ms latency. I'd pop my bubble to save myself but then still die with the CD triggered.
---
I think you might be getting Private server latency mixed with Actual Batching
---
I laughed at this harder than I should have
---
Do you know if the healer was trying to dps as well?
---
I've seen priests say they will heal then I see them casting smite and shadow word pain.  Mana is not infinite.
---
A good priest will wait to land his biggest heal and not cast until you need another big heal.  Lots of little heals is completely the wrong way to priest.  Our efficiency is in our biggest heals.  So I'll wait until just before I can get maximum value before I even start casting, if there is enough buffer.  Otherwise, I'm regenning mana so I can ensure I can last the fight.
---
Do you use 1H or 2H?
---
And what level are you?
---
Go outside and do something else
---
If you're not an elf, you need to do both.
---
If he just scammed me and ran away without saying a word I would've just reported him and moved along. The fact he decided to rub it in with a troll portal channel then being cute in my whisper chat. Na I aint letting that slide
---
Hahaha get on my level or get Lost filthy casual
---
Hey man! There might have been others that already answered your questions but I am pretty new to the game and thought my experience so far might be helpful :).
---
1. The game is very "noob" friendly. I haven't bothered with ridiculous questing add-ons and instead have made the game a journey, which it is by default. You will explore and figure out what you enjoy and don't enjoy. I have rerolled my main three times and have finally settled. It's all about figuring out what playstyle you enjoy.
---
2. I cannot answer this but I know the advice from guildies has been to kill everything on your way to a quest or destination. If it crosses you path, obliterate it. The extra xp goes a long way at the higher levels.
---
3. This is a game about adventure and journeying into unknown areas, it doesn't take as much commitment as many make it look like it takes. You can have fun and enjoy yourself only playing 8hrs a week. Your progression will be slower but you also won't have to fight for as many mobs as those that play more often and earlier in classics lifespan had to.
---
4. The games normal servers are PvE but many, including myself, feel the true game is on the PvP servers. It makes the conflict between horde and alliance seem more real. And world PvP is hella fun, chasing down the opposite faction that is in your zone is thrilling and the actual fights are exhilarating. It's the spirit of classic and honestly it's a ton of fun.
---
Hopefully this helped you out. I only have around 50hrs in the game so far so I figured my fresh eyes would help you. Welcome to Azeroth!
---
Some random guy payed me 1g to walk him from the UC Zepp to the UC FP. So I assume stuff like this could make you a decent amount of gold
---
&gt; Multi-shot works kinda like a cone attack.
---
That's not even remotely accurate.
---
With bartender, select the 2 right bars and make them invisible unless mouseover üòâ and hide bag bar
---
Tank tanks them both, no one attacks princess, someone interrupts her heals. Easy as that.
---
Thats your opinion. And your opinion doesnt matter.
---
go any server you want. they all high+ population anyways
---
wow....So, you're saying, essentially, a tank sporting all greens can tank Rag?
---
The point is, for any particular piece of gear for a given slot, you have the shittiest piece, (a level 5 green), and you have the absolute best piece, (a purple, or whatever BiS piece it is).  Now, somewhere in that scale, there comes a point where you are sufficiently geared to do Rag, or any other boss fight.  
---
Do you, "NEED", BiS in every slot?  No, you don't.  You really don't.  But, I fucking want it!  You don't like, I don't care!
---
Isn‚Äôt it collusion that is against TOS?
---
Red = dead
---
Blizzard killed Skeram themselves with shitty decisions.
---
Before 60, you would be fighting to get MF to do more dps than your wand. Since that is the only filler that exists, you would likely be wanding so you don't have mana issues with free damage.
---
IMO its best to SW:P a main target and just wand. If you need to get a skull down, mind blast first. SW:P multiple mobs if tank can handle it. 
---
Thing is shadow has no real tricks to increase damage. You just kind of throw up dots and wand.
---
I only wish there were a way to take a picture of the screen using the computer itself. Like a print screen button we could paste into programs. Alas, no such thing exists, apparently.
---
Succubus becomes better than voidwalker for killing enemies quickly one after another right away when you get her. The same goes for imp afaik. If single target grinding is all you care about you should probably never use the vw even level 10-20.
---
The voidwalker does however shine when you want to do a difficult pull of 4 or more mobs as you can kill one while another one is feared and the rest are temporarily tanked by the voidwalker. You also get the voidwalker sacrifice for when either he or you gets low. Situations like that are not the normal way you should be leveling as killing so many enemies at once is pretty inefficient if you factor in the drinking and summoning you have to do afterwards. However it can be nice to bust out the voidwalker when you have to kill a quest mob that is standing in a camp with three of his friends for example or for escort quests (chicken anyone?) where you get attacked by four mobs at once.
---
Looking for a quest addon with WotLK style colored areas, instead of single markers like questie. Thanks.
---
Use details, you can actually see and post who broke cc
---
The ultimate gank: making the other side leave the server all together. 
---
Then you follow them.
---
About to ruin that poor hunter's career
---
Yeah, I did have a decent guess, I asked the question for clarification, you elitist twat.
---
I think mob grinding or Desolace would be better
---
I would say 3 of them are bots, and the main should be banned
---
2k gold from BRD pp runs is 100+ hours of doing it...
---
if you know how then why wouldn't you...
---
&lt;Make Azeroth Great Again&gt; lulz
---
While everyone else is simulating the original Installation Experience, i'm still Mining the Metals to re-Build my Computer from 2004 from Scratch.
---
I was trying to overly simplify it for someone who seemed to have no concept of how it works. Also, it's still roughly a cone. Not gonna hit a target that's directly beside you or behind you with it.
---
But go off.
---
You can try for 600g, that's what people are wanting on my server. Realistically, it's worth 300-450g right now with the amount of cash in the server. It's absolutely the badassest model in the game.
---
Thanks :)
---
yes they are.  im coming to this conclusion.  Getting really bad drops, rarely ever any greens.  Inside dungeons seems to be a lot better.  Anyone know of any good dungeons a druid can stealth inside, preferably higher?  SM is too low for epics.
---
That's completely wrong
---
Alliance peaceful in Badlands? Man on Sulfuras the earth elemental and trogg areas are littered with corpses from both factions.
---
Top tier rogues make use of poisons is why alch/herb is popular for them. Leathworking is better on a hunter due to hunting for pet food is often killing beasts anyway. If you aren't already going engineer that is. With all this considered, you can probably shove LW on a druid or something. But go alch is my advice
---
The rare female tauren hunter. Nice
---
You can do it solo as a mage too. I got my pattern after 4 tries.
---
I haven't used sexymap in a very long time. I may explore using it, but the titanpanel option listed below, was very nice actually. I forgot Titan Panel even existed haha. Thank you though!
---
In war, they have to do that, because you can‚Äôt tell someone to switch to a pve server IRL.
---
Un'Goro is going to be much more xp dense. Also, just my opinion, it's a more fun zone.
---
Why it is worth that much?
---
Grobbulus is amazing, it's RP-PVP and while I do not RP I like to see it happen, makes the world feel alive and people are so friendly! If you decide on us and play Horde shoot a message to me! We have a guild we're currently all leveling in, hoping to casual core raid at 60 :)
---
That's something I really like about Monster Hunter. Skimpy female armor is always skimpy on males too!
---
Okay I will sum up what I said to make it clear...  He said...  "I want to spend less time playing..."  and he said " I have no choice"  that's what I commented cause I found it to be hilarious.
---
Please explain how it works to a newb like me?
---
Execute missing when leveling sucks 
---
Execute not critting in raid will make you rage even more though
---
The extent to which they're doing this reminds me of the Gallywix community on retail. They do gold carries with startling efficiency.
---
TINY RICK
---
Nice! Been soloing SFK for gold as a druid. Nice to see that's still doable at higher lvl dungeons.
---
The reason people pick up skinning at all is because two gathering professions are better than one. Best would be herb/mining, but since you can have only one detect spell active at a time, people either run skinning/herb or skinning/mining. Mining should net you much more money than herbalism tho. The only reason to have herbalism is if you are planning to become an alchemist at 60 and stockpile all the herbs for that purpose, which is how I am doing it.
---
Id always rather have a warlock then a mage personally. It's more fun using warlock CC, sheepskin are just so predictable.
---
Grobbulus is RP? I'm on EU so Idk
---
Yes they are in theory, however you get groups much easier than either of them as a mage which is why its still faster than both of them.
---
I didn't say what you do is terrible, but you're making it sound like it's a good way to make money. It's not.
---
This is amazing! Really great work my friend.
---
Top dps in raids where you can spam execute like a brain dead monkey. Havent seen a fury war do decent dps in any dungeons. Dont take em on my tank.
---
You got all excited, and now you‚Äôre a head of the curve.
---
Here‚Äôs your current options:
---
Take a break.
---
Farm mats/rep/consumables.
---
Go gank nubs.
---
Work on an alt.
---
I‚Äôm not, I never stated anywhere that it‚Äôs good. You made that assumption.
---
Literally unplayable
---
My friend and I are a holy paladin and a arms warrior respectively. We are level 31 and can handle elites on our own. 
---
I was thinking of 2 manning SM GY, while obviously slower than with a 5 man party, would give more exp per person since less people to divide the exp by.
---
Is this okay? Or must I always go with a 5 man party?
---
I had a mage insist 3g for 6 stacks of water. No fewer stacks or fewer gold. I told him it was too expensive and he said it was a great deal because it's way cheaper than vendor water. Luckily for him I had a dungeon group waiting for me.
---
What level can do u do the quest
---
tera actually had a decent lifetime over here in the us. many people loved its combat, including me. main reasons it died out over here was endgame grew stale/not a lot of endgame content was pushed out (not to be confused with black desert online, which people hate due to it literally having no endgame) and the fact that one of the races received MUCH more content then any of the others, and said races appeal is not something a majority of westerners care for
---
We did this last night and I just pulled the princess to the back of the room and kited her around on my mage with some lower rank spells, blinking closer to our healer if I took a few hits.  Our melee and tank took down the emperor. 
---
She did get one heal off on him, but I was able to counterspell the rest.
---
The dude is the face of wow. Its not about if you like him or not. He's just very popular and therefore marketable.
---
Pot calling the kettle black?
---
I think we‚Äôre talking about the same area. We were in the part that has two levels, upper level being on the left, where it slopes down and curves to the right, and the mobs drop land mines. We hugged the wall. Pulled maybe three or four, then the entire area aggro‚Äôd, so about 25 mobs showed up and chased us until we wiped.
---
Unless you're strictly fighting one target, you should be prioritizing whirlwind over bloodthirst.
---
You chose to roll the evil faction. That‚Äôs reason enough.
---
I‚Äôm not dictating anything, I‚Äôm saying you don‚Äôt have a right to inconvenience other people to meet your demands because of the role you chose. 
---
You can play however you want. If you wanna whisper every group demanding shit and putting the group members in bad spots because it gets you your way without having to work for it, then cool. I‚Äôm gonna call you a dick, cause stepping on other people to get to the top is something dicks do. I‚Äôm not saying you should be a charity giving out tank runs to the less fortunate, but having guaranteed tank loot and an equal chance as the rest of the group for non tank gear is more than fair.
---
Lol okay so you‚Äôve never seen it happen, so I must have made it up and convinced everyone interacting or voting this thread to believe it‚Äôs real right? 
---
Jesus Christ man, it‚Äôs like talking to a fucking wall. I started a thread for discussion on why I think you‚Äôre a dick if this is how you play. I‚Äôm not saying you have to obey what I think is right, but this guy on the internet thinks you‚Äôre a dick if you play in a way where you disregard others so you can have an unfair advantage.
---

LFR is tuned around the below average player. Naxx is tuned around the tryhard player. It's as simple as that. You can do LFR incredibly undergeared and with tons of mistakes. Naxx simply has a higher bar by design. I feel like people only remember level 70 Naxx or something when they compare it to LFR, but even then pugging 70 Naxx wasn't as faceroll easy as LFR.
---
Uh... how am I being a dick, just clean your room fam.
---
That works too. It's just kind of sad having to explain to someone that playing the game will feel better than having shit handed to you.
---
It's important to make friends by being nice,  prepared, giving out hearthstones and SS, show up early so you can summon partymembers. Tell tanks/healers (you like) after a run that you will put them on friendslist, they will probably then do the same. When I log in I get /w from players all the time who want me to join even tho I'm not a mage or in the same guild. If I make a new group I just /w all the healers and tanks in my firendslist. You can't be angry to not get any invites if you havent put any effort in getting friends. This is not retail. 
---
Warlock brings tons of utility for a group.
---
Didn't expect a full grown man to be such a bitch about 1g.
---
I'll check them out. I always go to 7cloud youtube channel for his/her lofi hiphop. it's got a looped gif of a girl in a spaceship playing video games. the whole vibe really speaks to me, fking love it.
---
Very much this, afaik there are two layers that can farm the Devilsaurs. Once layering is removed, you effectively reduce the amount of Devilsaurs by 50% and more and more people will be farming, so I'd expect Devilsaur prices to increase.
---
Stoneform is pretty great.  And eventually, I'll get those BoE handguards.
---
You might just not like this game my dude
---
I'm currently level 49 /w most of the shadoweave set (minus the chest piece). I feel like I'm struggling with content at the moment. Particularly in dungeons, I find myself having to life tap after every fight. Is this normal? I've never levelled a Warlock before so this is all new for me. It's getting harder to wand enemies to death and my Voidwalker isn't very good at maintaining threat (in fact it will typically always lose threat at some point).
---
I find myself rotating between dots (Immolate, Corruption, CoA) + wanding and siphon life + drain life. I guess I don't really have much downtime since I normally just fight one enemy at a time, but most people seem to be talking about juggling more than one. I don't think I have the mana to fight more than 2 or 3 monsters, and if I'm able to kill them and survive, I definitely have to eat/drink. What am I doing wrong?

My talents currently look like this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IAMfhRbkVZMxh](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IAMfhRbkVZMxh)

Any tips? I'm on Yojamba (Alliance) in case anyone wants to chat in-game.
---
Mail isn‚Äôt that expensive. I have a Warrior myself  that I tank with as well so I have pretty much no skills that I haven‚Äôt bought. I‚Äôm level 27 and have 10g right now.

Google isboxer

Now someone tame Echeyaki as alliance
---
As rogue main, specifically backstab spec, I can assure you that the sound is correct.
---
&gt;  Not gonna hit a target that's directly beside you or behind you with it.
---
It literally will and spreading this kind of misinformation is *why* bad hunters have no idea how to target with ms and why bad tanks have no idea how to position in a way that wont cause it to hit the sheep.
---
Seems like he doesn't understand the game. If he's not enjoying it, i.e. not getting "enough" for the time invested, he's not playing the right game. TL;DR: You tell them to "go back to retail".
---
To my knowledge, there is no scientific evidence which suggests that looking at monitors have adverse, permanent effects on a persons eye-sight.
---
It can make them dry though, so keeping eye-drops close can be a good idea.
---
I thought spamming demo shout wasn't worth it anymore after the hotfix. And what about sunder?
---
That's maybe true for WL, but everyone and their mother is always looking for a priest.
---
For real? That is so awesome!
---
In all seriousness though, Im a new wow player in general, and Ive been having a great time with classic. havent really participated in PVP yet, but after last week and a few posts from this subreddit has got me pumped to fight some dudes
---
The genesis for this whole exchange was the fact that I saw the multishot hit the sheep. I didn't need the addon, I have eyes. I only posted the data because he denied it. If he'd just said, "Sorry, my bad," we could all have moved on with our days.
---
Reminds me of Dial a Port on P99
---
Maybe from 40-42. At 42, a full run of Uldaman and completion of all the quests outside will get you to 43 really fast. Prepping for ZF by grabbing all of the quests will get you to 44. Then actually running ZF with every quest will get you immediately 45.
---
Then doing a run around Tanaris with that dense quest density is a clear cut path to 46. The quests aint even hard and are about 75% kill quests you can group for.
---
That's 4 extremely fast levels out of the way
---
Guy joined my RP guild on retail, seemed enthusiastic, presented ideas for a storyline and all.
---
About a week passes and he says he needs gold to buy sub via a WoW token, we all chip in to help him out.
---
The next day he's gquit. Not just a gquit though, he also changed his character name and race changed. Except the new name is in our friend lists and in the guild log ("Soandso has left the guild" changed to his new name").
---
Naturally we whispered him asking wtf but nobody got a reply. We just assumed it was all an elaborate hoax to get gold off us. But the guy went a long way for it if he also shelled out for a race change. But it did teach me to never be charitable unless it's someone I actually trust and know personally.
---
Are you the guy that scammed me? Seems plausible with that reply tbh.
---
I think 1g is an ok price. Its not much, but its substantial enough to matter. Im ofc talking about lvl 45 water/food. Which is very expensive.
---
3g is ridiculous. Maybe if it were like 10 stacks, since that requires almost two mana bars. But still.
---
Its more about the gesture. Yes it's free to make, but its an inconvenience. Thats why i ask for a joke as payment if you are poor. 
---
But apparently thats too much for this sub according to the downvotes im getting
---
Mobs dont like hitting shields sometimes it causes them to switch targets
---
Pretty sure there is a cc break tab that will tell you who broke what cc with what spell. Just for future reference because the way you did it just proves multishot was used not anything else.
---
Same thing happened on Stalagg. As alliance Horde made a point of KOS and griefing every instance and outnumbered us 2-1, switched to Heartseeker and the balance is basically he opposite, but it seems like most of us "know what it was like" so the hordes aren't getting griefed nearly as bad.
---
They should have made the transfers Faction exclusive.
---
&gt;you will then have a chat exc
---
Wow I had no idea, this is really my first wow experience, thank you ill give it a try
---
Nop.
---
Sorry he bursted your bubble that in the world of Warcraft classic, only nice, civil people plays. None of those internet jerks play this jerk because the game is just too old.
---
Im not seeing proof of either
---
I can't wait to hear the rest of this story once the enabling parents have passed away. Moderation is the key. But if you have some chenical imbalance I doubt theres anything besides meds that will work for this condition.
---
U are not hardcore just bad :)
---
It‚Äôs an insult because of the implication that retail is the easy version, and that you really aren‚Äôt the target audience for a more hardcore game.   So you should save yourself some frustration, and go back to retail.   
---
I know it‚Äôs a stretch, but I do think it sometimes about people complaining about some aspects of classic (flightpaths, skill training costs, etc.).
---
What addon are you using to gt your energy and health and bars to look all nice and clean?
---
Whats your name and I'll message you
---
Well, most of my time in the pvp realm I am on is spent questing and walking by horde who dont care to fight. The only time anyone seems to fight is when they comfortably outnumber or level you. Currently questing with a friend to the top of Jintha'Alor and have passed several Horde groups who neither care or even look at us. Its just questing with the option to grief the enemy if we feel like it. Not some huge team struggle. Often most people dont even bother to join a group to fight campers because "theres no honor system yet"
---
&gt;hen you found your group type /leave 4
---
Thank you booger, that helps a lot :)

The same
---
Loved this!
---
I didn‚Äôt come from retail though I did try to get into it a few times throughout the years.  I mainly played 2004 to 2007.  I like this version of the game way more then retail so I won‚Äôt be going back as I don‚Äôt have anything to return to.
---
&gt;Then they go, deny everything and make Jaina have a relationship with a dragon and Thrall marry a random NPC before going on extended parental leave

I mean, that's kinda how it usually works out in real life :/

Life is life

Na na na na na

Same. Stalagg to Heartseeker also.

its pretty well accepted in any group ive been in that everyone needs a world drop to PREVENT someone from just stealing it

xD
---
This is absolute trash.
---
Thank you.
---
You must have a lot of personal issues with friends that you don't understand. Have you been tested? You might be on the spectrum if you don't understand why that's something you shouldn't say to someone without knowing them. You wouldn't say that in person because it'd be awkward as fuck. Like if someone invited you into their house to show them a wall they wanted you to paint and then you start critiquing their design style or how the inside of their house looks. No one is going to take that well buddy. Sorry I had to explain it to you hopefully you get it one day maybe a little less time on Reddit will help
---
Does he though? I see Blackstone, devilsaurs set, good weaps using human racial...
---
He could try for truestrike shoulders on top and it would be absolute BiS I'd say.
---
Which classes/scenarios are you not getting good DPS against?
---
As a dps warrior you dont really have a say anyway. 
---
But ofc you are not wrong to not want to tank. Play how you like and don't do anything you dont think is fun. Thats what i think is the only way to play.
---
Detect ore is kinda stupid. The nodes are easy to see. Detect flowers is the one you gotta keep up.
---
I picture a giant Fly swatter!
---
I've had a lot of success using the LookingForGroup channel. My server uses it a lot so it actually works.
---
That makes sense.
---
Probably not worth the investigation over 50 silver, it's also a much better way to find out someone is dishonest than them ninja looting something important.
---
holy shit
---
i bet you feel stupid af right now
---
Your ranged is getting aggro because of their dots still ticking on her, most likely.
---
Nah man, we‚Äôre all about the Name-n-Shame on this sub. There‚Äôs no hiding in Classic
---
Is windseeker dead?
---
I made an undead warlock on westfall back at launch. Was wondering why it was so quiet- westfall has highest alliance population of all na servers. Switched her to windseeker because I figured it couldn't get more dead. Found a group for rfc within 10 mins but trade chat in city was dead quiet except for a few lfg. Will they ever condense servers or did I just make a huge mistake?
---
1-2 seconds is pretty good depending on how many mobs are involved.
---
I feel like there is an unshared second drawing of the dog screwing the hunter....
---
OMFG WORK WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN I LOVE YOU.
---
Please tell me your rogue is a gnome
---
No but I fuckin wish
---
Oh okay cool, it isn't radial at all, as in it has a max amount of targets, as opposed to blizzard which is placement aoe with no upper limit of targets assuming they're all in the area of affect.
---
And posts like this just sound like people suffering on a bad server lol
---
More intensive on the system probably. Mine has about a 50% chance to crash my game when I do it.
---
Yeah, it won‚Äôt be a problem with a decent group.
---
Nothing hard about using totems though
---
Neat Minimap on curse hides everything around the minimap until you mouse over it. It‚Äôs a great light weight Addon.
---
There was minimap button bag or MBB that put all buttons into one that would show all of them when clicked on. It still works, but if you use Questie it puts all the quest icons into the button bag. I am sure it‚Äôs fixable if someone wanted to take it over. I am not a coder if I was, I would give it a shot
---
That we can agree on.
---
for shadow weaving you just being a priest that specs down to shadow weaving then heals after applying the debuff 
---
and yes in a team environment everyone should carry their weight even if it's easy. if the player is a baller for your guild and earns the right to be carried by the guild sure, some people are like that but at the end of the day your top players will get disgruntled
---
This guy is fucking awful.
---
My personal opinion is that if someone actually needs the item then that person needs and rest pass/greed. But I've been in plenty of situations where that isn't the same opinion everyone else in my party has.
---
I've done mostly guild runs latley so haven't run into the problem past week.
---
Immolate is mana inefficient. Consider using Succubus instead of Void, especially if your Void isn‚Äôt holding aggro anyways. Pick up Dark Pact and turn off some of the auto on your Succ‚Äôs moves so you can drain her mana.

Rule 3 does not apply to the Name-n-Shame policy we have here. You can‚Äôt hide in Classic

Isnt that what he was trying to prove to him though? The use of multi shot? Granted CC broken is the better metric to see how much cc was broken by any player but still.
---
Had this in a simple PuG doing quests. Almost died as a Pally several and the priest never (I‚Äôm over and hour) cast a heal. Even if any build can heal a group in a place everything has to come together right still.

---
Thats funny. Because this one guy keeps messaging me asking for boosts almost daily. He spends more time asking for boosts than actually leveling. He would be lvl 40 by now if he had just played the game. Instead he sits in stormwind begging people for boosts. I dont get it. Does he think boosts are actually faster, even with waiting 2h for someone to finally say yes? Idk.

I think you're lying

I'm a completely new player to WoW and I've been looking for PvP guides for priest but I haven't been able to find any good ones. They are either guides on retail, which I've never played and I don't know what similarities they share, or they are healing priests. Any good resources would be greatly appreciated.

I have 12 days and no epic mount.

How is kromcrush for horde/alliance ratio?

Anyone have any goldshire doggo pics?

i am not talking about the gear or how many people can fail. i am talking purely from a how many things to you need to deal with LFR in retail outright removes abilities or makes them deal no damage so you really only have 2ish things that you need to deal with which is the mechanical level naxx is at.
---
naxx just asks that out of those 40 people only 2-3 people may fail it rather than half+ the raid in LFR. mythic raiding in retail 5-6 things to deal with in each phase out of a 3-4 phase fight while still having that 1-2 people may only fail or it is a wipe.
---

Try /4

Yeah, while I tend to side with the narrative that OP was probably doing some sketchy shit, I'm much less quick to judge in this situations due to past experience.

I've been banned from GTA5 twelve times between the years 2016 and 2018, all twelve bans were reversed after contacting customer support. They may have plenty of tools at their disposal, but there are still humans performing a duty, and where humans are mistakes follow.

Really? I need to test that.

I didn't even know she healed till I had already done it several times.  I'd just ignore it.

Is mage bear? Drood is bear. Bear is best

Okay, just a separate gear set and im good to go. Thanks!
---
I used Neat Minimap for about 2 weeks I think, but it had small issues every now and then for me. If I loved an icon, and then the icons disappeared, the icon would be stuck to my mouse until reload, and it disabled the "Turn Off" option for most addons minimap buttons. 
---
I did like it, and might use it if those issues were fixed, and speaking of those I should hop over and report those as issues so the maker knows.
---
So about spellstones, how do I know when to utilize them in combat? After all after I swap qwapons I gotta wait 3p seconds till use, so is it worth using? How do I incorporate it in a fight?
---
As a level 30 in STV for the axe quest. Ganked 21 times in an hour.
---
DM me pics, plz
---
Yes RP-pvp server
---
Yeah. Sort of. Either way, it‚Äôs a goal to strive for. A reason people play, or do any particular content. BiS has a much looser meaning these days on live, but classic is where you can definitively plan out gear and label something best. BiS IS classic, wether you were aware of it or not back then.
---
Likewise. I love having the AoE toolkit so when there‚Äôs a pack of melee mobs in a quest area or dungeon I can take them down super-efficiently but just AoE grinding zombies all day is not my idea of fun.
---
You have the right to make the demand, but you don‚Äôt have the right to the loot. 
---
If you‚Äôre going to start scanning for grammatical inconsistencies to fit your narrative, I‚Äôm not going to keep discussing this with you.

There are rumors of a level squish next expansion, putting us at 50 and having to get to 60 again.

He said stop breaking sheep with multishot. If that was what I care about I would link CC breaks.

Boomkins look funnier than any mage. Viability be damned.

1. Yes, it can easily take up all of your free-time.
---
2. No, it's much easier. It's just time consuming, not hard but fun.
---
It‚Äôs not.  This is retail version.  The mobs up their in classic are different from retail.  I‚Äôd like to see this area opened up as a classic+ area but with a different story then the one from retail.
---
There's also just not much cash to be had. People want epic mounts, or are in Blackrock Mountain all day long doing dungeons, so the population that sees your ad is smaller.
---
That's some straight lies you're spewing
---
I think part of the reason it was so terrible for us is that I went in at lvl 28 arms warrior, we had a 30 frost mage, and a 31-32 feral Druid tank, then PUG‚Äôd a healer and another DPS. We kept getting aggro from the entire area on that last corridor, even with hugging the left wall, and trying to avoid bombs that were blowing up in our faces.
---
What is the cap?

It's based on a 'real' place

Regardless of the reason, having a healing spec will help.
---
Have tank tank em both.  Interrupt her heals.  If you're not playing with retailers they should know how to interrupt casts.  If you have retailers in the group then tell them to read what their abilities do and use the ones that interrupt casts or silence the target.
---
All misconduct is in-game though? Except for forum shitalking. Should people not be banned for cheating? and flying everywhere and instant-killing everything since it is in-game?

I‚Äôve run all the way up to a full clear on BRD as shadow spec healing. It‚Äôs really not that bad. He probably either didn‚Äôt have his healing skills leveled or wasn‚Äôt managing his mana right. Was he trying to keep everyone topped off instead of focusing heals on the threat holder?

No starter edition for wow classic
---
20s scam of the century huh
---
You've got a pretty low bar there
---
When I was a kid I actually leveled like that. I begged people to carry me through SM etc. (much like WoWhobbs did in his videos) and while it took long to get someone to actually do it, it kind of was faster for me to level this way than to actually just play the regular way because I was utter dogshit at the game and had no idea what to do. People begging for boosts are very likely the same. They are just too stupid to pick up quests for their level range and do them and once they got a boost or two it only gets worse because they might've gotten like 10 levels via boost but never actually learned how to use their new abilities etc. or have bad gear and it results in them having an even worse time questing. These people simply need to grow a pair and learn how to properly quest and find dungeon groups which does take some time to learn but its better than having to constantly rely on other players.

Do you mean you can level to 20 in classic as trial? It only applies to retail, does it?

Need an addon that will let me share me and my friends share our XP, preferably with LDB option. Basically [this](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/friend-xp-bar) but functioning.

One that shares gear would be even better.
---
I like it! Keep going I want to hear what happens on your way to Orgrimmar
---
Never
---
Some. Not most, really.
---
You don‚Äôt really have many options until you start getting abilities. Ret is generally better at leveling early but I doubt you have the 1 gold to respec. Just use your highest dps weapon with seal do righteousness and keep wisdom in yourself. Pull slowly. You don‚Äôt have abilities that let you grind groups of mobs yet.
---
You can jump down at the beginning to your right I believe, if you have a rogue opening the door and capability to clear a big pack without too much room to kite. I have no personal experience of doing it like this but I assume that's how one group was doing it who were LFMing for "miniboss run".

And I have ravenger on my hunter, I got it because Noone else needed. I have it on a macro for raptor strike. When in a situation where there's big pulls, I run in and try to get lucky procs in between auto shots. If it procs its well worth it even at level 60.

This existed on Beta as well. I reported it but don't think it got fixed.

Everyone needs because those items have the same value to everyone. Since its BoE someone can sell it and use the money to buy upgrades they need.

Tbh I think the "Riders" patrolling around the camp do aggro, but normal "Guards" do not. Proper guards should be added in the Naxx patch, along with additional NPCs.

Yep you either get it or you don‚Äôt

I agree with 55+. Can't run out of quests, and you'll be farming pre-bis which is basically free xp. I went from 58-60 in the time it took a single lvl otherwise, while getting gear. LBRS runs are good chill xp at that lvl.

I have a wife, 2 kids and a career. I did the whole meme spec thing (unknowingly) when i was 15.

I am helping the 39 other guys in the raid by putting the Same effort in on raids. And yes min max runs can be fun. You dont have to be special to have fun. We have great fun improving last weeks time.

I have been in other raids but i cant be bothered doing MC in 3h + because i Already know we wont progress AQ with only 1 mandatory raid per week if MC doesnt go smooth.
---
Even if this meme spec is 95%, im going for 100% because i need/want that for my time scheduel/experience.

So again like the OP, to each his own. I am looking for a raid where all People set the bar about as high as me.

Did you read the post?

Let me just copy and paste my reply from last time 
---
"I‚Äôm not dictating anything, I‚Äôm saying you don‚Äôt have a right to inconvenience other people to meet your demands because of the role you chose.
---
You can play however you want. If you wanna whisper every group demanding shit and putting the group members in bad spots because it gets you your way without having to work for it, then cool. I‚Äôm gonna call you a dick, cause stepping on other people to get to the top is something dicks do. I‚Äôm not saying you should be a charity giving out tank runs to the less fortunate, but having guaranteed tank loot and an equal chance as the rest of the group for non tank gear is more than fair."
---
Unless you have anything other than made up ideas of me telling people how to play the game, when in reality I'm expressing why I think people who play this way are dicks, then go ahead and let me know, otherwise I'm done wasting time replying to your comments.

Ive done a lot of shady shit in many different games and have never been banned. I'm 99,9% sure OP is to blame

I would only disagree with Warrior 6 dmg, because single target is more important, and they get OP with BIS gear.
---
Thank you
---
It looks like an addon you downloaded that lets you import talents to choose. Just delete the addon and you should be good.
---
Love it!
---
In addition to what the others said, if you dont like large chunks of grinding, try killing every viable mob you see while questing, even if they arent part of your current quest log. That extra bit of xp padding can go a long way
---
Don‚Äôt play a pvp server
---
It's beautiful.
---
Haha. Yeah it's was great feeling, like you really achieve something. I know it's nothing at all but some some reason it was so satisfying to go and buy our first mounts with my friend.
---
Hunter is just an incomplete class in vanilla. Same with paladin.
---
Is there an addon to blacklist people of your own fraction? I couldn't find one for classic yet... I've been writing a blacklist on my desktop lol...
---
Bro why is your name red shorts?  Isn‚Äôt your dick so small now that you look like a ken doll?
---
The Barman Shanker is one of the best pre-raid daggers for rogues. The high weapon damage greatly benefits ambush and backstab.
---
There are only 2 better daggers pre-raid, Heartseeker which is very expensive to make (Blacksmithing), and Specter Blade which requires killing a special boss while Paladin's do their mount quest. I do not think horde can get specter's blade before phase 4.
---
All that said, for most players Barman Shanker is the best pre-raid option for main hand dagger.
---
I had about 60 gold at level 40, and from level 40-41 I grinded basilisks and did a few quests in stv until I had enough gold.
---
That requires interaction with them though.
---
"You'll have all the Slurm you want when you're partying with Slurms Mackenzie later."
---
"When is that gonna be?"
---
"Soon enough."
---
"That isn't soon enough!"
---
&gt; Tanaris and Badlands are the only good questing zones
---
Hinterlands, Searing Gorge and Feralas are all amazing.
---
From watching like 5 minutes:
---
1) You keep standing in front of whatever you're attacking. You should always be dpsing behind the target. This is dpsing 101.
---
2) You don't prioritize WW at all even though it should be the first thing you cast if you're charging into a pack of 3.
---
3) You waste 50 rage executing a mob with 300 hp.
---
4) It seems like you're just randomly running out to intercept/hamstring like it's pvp.
---
5) It looks like you're wearing half tank gear. No idea how you got ironfoe and no mask of the unforgiven/green 2% hit shoulders or truestrike.
---
Azshara is pretty decent for Rich Thorium veins too as far as I know.
---
I've thought about going herbalism+alchemy but ant the market going to be like full of potions and herbs? I mean I see so many people going herb+alch..... Still I haven't decided what I'll be doing
---
Read its phase 5, don't know if it's true though
---
Why not go for rogue instead of druid if you are looking for sneak and dps?
---
They are literally the sneaky character
---
Get the hinterlands hit trinket instead of mark of the chosen. It doesnt do anything unless you are tanking
---
No one ever reaches hit cap lol
---
Are there any rogues that can share their opening macros for slice and dice? I tried creating my own macro to open with Garrote + Slice and dice but for some reason, slice and dice does not triggered. This is what my macro looks like:
---
    #showtooltip Garrote
---
    /cleartarget [dead][help]
---
    /cast Garrote
---
    /cast Slice and Dice
---
I totally bypassed STV via dungeons
---
I mean my group had two warriors who actually needed it. 
---
Not every group is the same composition so you rolling a need on it with a group who either didn‚Äôt want it or w/e is fine. To me the dude needs for a weapon he‚Äôll rarely use in comparison to two melee focused classes who it‚Äôd be better for.
---
I'm not there yet! That why I said 'wait!'
---
The level 50 class quests aren't in game yet
---
I don't speak weeb sorry
---
Wouldn't surprise me. I have distant memory that it was very long into the game, but I suck at googling to figure out in what order all the content came back then. It was clearly reaction to some classes being like wtf, why are weapon enchants only for some classes? I think the +22 int came later as well to further balance the weapon enchant options.
---
No. Affliction is the least gear dependent spec and also the superior leveling spec. Soul link only becomes strong with strong gear, as in tier 2+/ pvp sets. Leveling as destruction wouldn‚Äôt make any sense due to mana inefficiency. In dungeons, healers should be keeping HoTs on you so you can use lifetap for no downtime.
---
That‚Äôs probably an alt so he‚Äôll just send the cash to a main. Or, an idiot.
---
Yes, I'm interested in the PvE content, dungeoning and raiding, even tho I don't have a guild etc. But as I'm playing tank, my no.1 task is to keep my threat level top 1 so engineering might help with that, while blacksmithing wont.... Uhhhh I don't know what to doooo
---
Then the hunter is bad, but also if relying on cc prior to level 56 then your group is probably in over your head.
---
Theres too many mages that just want to CC, it's normally not necessary and will only slow your progress. Only time you should cc is when healer is having trouble keeping the tank up, or healer is running oom every fight. And you should pull with sheep, to keep the cc away from everything so you can still aoe.
---
If your a mage the sheep's just to sheep without it being needed, I feel nothing about breaking your sheep everytime. There is no reason to sacrifice 20-40% of the groups dps just so you can feel like your doing something.
---
Found the scammer.
---
Damn you are a toxic guy. No wonder you dont have friends and use your time on reddit to slur other people.
---
I'll send you a link to a picture of the ticket later, it absolutely happened.
---
So what?
---
I had 80 at 40 which was my goal as I got confused thinking mount and riding cost 80, not 90. I won't have enough for my epic either but I'm comfortable at 400g at 56 without any world now drop boosts.
---
When I looked up the enchant on wowhead to check for new comments someone say they think the +15 and +25 agi enchants will be added either P5 or P6.
---
But of course they didn't cite a source and I was unable to find anything specifically mentioning that after a quick Google search.
---
Maybe someone else knows more, but I couldn't find anything. But I also didn't look too hard.
---
Dude this happened yesterday... some guy says in trade he‚Äôs looking for people with mooncloth cool down. I happen to be on the way to make my first mooncloth, so I PM him and say I can sell him mooncloth, On my way to auberdine. 
---
He says he can give me felcloth, and a tip (non disclosed amount). I already have the felcloth, and I also obviously had to buy the recipe. I tell him I don‚Äôt need felcloth, just gold.
---
Then he says, ‚Äúso why are you whispering me?‚Äù
---
...because you need mooncloth?
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not paying 20g for mooncloth at AH prices and mine is on cool down‚Äù
---
....why do you think they‚Äôre 20g? We all have the cool down. Why would someone just give you the 15g profit for nothing? Unless the ‚Äútip‚Äù you‚Äôre talking about was 10g. 
---
‚ÄúBecause some people aren‚Äôt assholes and do nice things for other people‚Äù
---
Oh okay.
---
The app on iphone x constantly bugs/ stops reacting to touch for me. Idk if it‚Äôs a data stream thing or not. I get 5-30 mbps stream whenever i test my connection.
---
Tier 0 is the dungeon gear, valor, shadowcraft, etc. And a lot of it is crap, not all, but don't buy it just because it's your set.
---
I remember speccing Prpt in Vanilla at 40 for the blessing and that 31 point shield skill. At that point it was interesting but most quest mobs/areas don't really favor that kind of playstyle (AOE grinding) so I respecced ret...
---
Chode
---
If that makes you feel better
---
But engineering helps maintaining the threat, right?
---
I‚Äôm in redridge and the gnolls are everywhere..
---
Or that yeah. I think a lock can also solo him.
---
lemme know when male human isnt the worst model in the game
---
I feel like hunters are pretty solid, it's the gear that's lacking, they didn't have anything specifically for Hunters really, and because of it people flip.
---
For me it would be a gkick without hesitation if someone begged like that without saying thank you.
---
If we're in a group and waiting for a mob, and you show up in another group and make no attempt to join our group it's every group for themselves.
---
You realize youre really the one coming off as a troll here, right? Well...an elitist jerk.
---
Like you said man, it's a game, relax.  I'd hate to breath wrong around you in real life, might never talk to me again.
---
Second for Desolace.  Went there after Shimmering Flats.  THEN I went to STV.
---
Thanks for your comment, I asked them and they assured me this was not the case. One of the persons that got aggro was a mage. I of course cannot know if they were truthful with me.
---
That's pretty good. Myself and some friends are leveling alliance alts there, but we main horde on stalagg.
---
Lok‚ÄôTar Ogar!
---
Nice try, you think he multishotted 78 times in the last fight? That is a total for dungoen/raid. He may not have multishotted that fight and this screen shot proves nothing.
---
For the 500th time. We get it
---
Go back to EVE.
---
We don't want your kind here.
---
It wasn‚Äôt this hard in ‚Äònilla! :P
---
Haha I thought it was very weird but fun that I still could fish either way :)
---
I literally just took the screenshot. But ok.
---
Okay thank you, I will look further into this, to discover the cause of our wipes.
---
And as everyone you are free to do as you whish.  I did never say it's no fun to play min max.  But similar to real life not everyone is min maxing. And never forget it's real people playing after all Mobbing and exclusion is a common but obviously questionable road to walk.  It's one thing to disagree with anyone's way to play but it's another thing to get angry if the raid picks one of them up for whatever reasons. 
---
And if you are lucky most of your guild mates will be with you here. All the best.
---
A signed 64 bit integer would have a maximum value of 9 quintillion or so; seems a bit overkill. It's probably a 32 bit integer of which the maximum value is 2,147,483,647. That value would more than likely represent your copper which would make the maximum gold amount 214,748g 36s 47c.
---
Whisper him and tell him to stop rigging our elections.
---
My gnome rogue, Undercutz, is a frequent poster on the AH, it works on so many levels.
---
You won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm on a PvP realm and even at 50 I find I‚Äôd rather the vw even just to have threat for the first 1/3 of the mobs life and have that option to sac being way superior to having succ out. I fear the folks suggesting succ really do just single pull and that‚Äôs wayyyy slower than what vw allows you to do. I‚Äôd also much rather pull mobs not at full health with vw out compared to succ. It just really isn‚Äôt close dark pact be damned. Drain tanking works fine with either pet why not have the option of 2+ mobs especially for humans who run AND have that sac option. 
---
If anything the vw has saved me in PvP more often than the succ just cause popping sac with a rogue or something on you enabling time for a fear is way better than dragging ur succ off the target and trying to get it to seduce said rogue. If you‚Äôre used to being engaged while in combat by the opposing faction it‚Äôs again, not close. Blueberry for life.
---
It does neither. I just dont understand how your brain works and how you are able to still be alive when clearly you are not cable of that.
---
Redridge was a spitting image of Barrens chat yesterday. There was a Horde Shaman running around on his mount only killing members of Olympus while waving at everyone else. Even saved me from too many mobs my blueberry decided to run through. 
---
Anyways, general chat was filled with Olympus members saying to report the dude for breaking TOS, others trolling those people, and then there were rando‚Äôs talking about nazis and other controversial topics.
---
They don‚Äôt have a bad rep, only in enhancement. Elemental/resto with nature‚Äôs swiftness is a top tier pvp build. Very versatile, strong dps good heals good buff.
---
The thing is, from the tank's perspective, it goes like this:
---
Logs on, wants to get together a group for his dungeon in which he wants to reserve a specific item.
---
Sees a group advertising they are looking for a tank for that dungeon.  
---
He whispers them, telling them he'd tank if that item is reserved for him. If everyone in the group is fine with it, he just saved that group and himself a bunch of time.
---
If the group is not fine with it, he doesn't join and goes on as initially planned. The only time lost there is the 2 whispers. There is no reason for him to not try and ask the group first.
---
The problems arising afterwards about the leader kicking the dps refusing to let the tank reserve because he's more easily replaced cannot be faulted on the tank asking, since it is a disagreement that is entirely between the leader and said dps (or said dps and the subset of group-members which are in favor of inviting the tank with his demands).
---
Suppression: Reduces the chance for enemies to resist your Affliction spells by 2/4/6/8/10%.
---
I don't know about the precise mechanics, but I would think it's related to their defense rather than your offense.
---
Thanks, all. I was helped out by a level 60 Paladin named, Hapurubokka. Got me through to the quest item and killed more to get me some other items. Appreciate the help.
---
A truer thought had never been spoken.
---
I'm lvling an alt druid this moment. Raids still need druids, a lot of them at least.
---
Sorry I meant spec into Demo or Destruction after I get 31 points in Affliction.
---
Finally someone not crying about PVP that they don‚Äôt like just because it‚Äôs inconvenient to them.  They‚Äôre like fair weather fans.
---
Just to confirm: the sit macro is a myth.
---
As a new player I don't really understand this thread.
---
Um dude. Wouldn't speccing into fire and wasting all those talent points in phase 1 be what is actually handicapping you? That was my point. Sure he can avoid your handicap by spamming frostbolt but he'd still be under the much LARGER handicap of being fire spec in MC lol. 
---
If you're worried about being handicapped, don't spam frostbolt in fire spec. Just fuckin' spec out of fire haha.
---
Cool, thank you!
---
There's a known issue with multi-shot where it chains *over 10 yards*.
---
It was my first time noticing. You don't gotta be a dick.
---
Got em
---
Lolololol that‚Äôs not even a word you stupid fuck
---
I'm quite clearly writing for people without any background in computer science or programming which is why it's phrased the way it is. For anyone with that background it's also painfully obvious what I meant.
---
Gimme hope
---
I enjoy ret but I‚Äôve always loved being a tank. I‚Äôm just going to bite the bullet and do why needs to be done when I get enough money
---
What kind of sociopath defends someone who is either doing something to troll it lying about it because he's too childish to admit making a mistake?
---
You want to play with them?  Go for it.  Someone needs to.
---
So why didn't you post that screen shot. This one literally proves nothing...
---
This is why I love classic.  It's the simple things...
---
Who has to CC in Armory lol
---
Yes, because it's easier, faster and better to just take a screenshot. I sometimes wonder how someone like this even manages to turn on the computer, let alone start the game and make a character.
---
Yes, I think like this.
---
Cheating and shitalking is not In-game things.
---
I did instant-killing script for fly cheat, my sin.
---
haha is this about Seeior on herod?
---
I hit 40 with 65g in my pocket. Get the rest from emptying my bank and farming elementals in Arathi Highlands. Some charms for the warrior quest that they drop were selling for 80s.
---
IIRC they were literally the last class added in Alpha, so yeah. Makes sense.
---
WHAT THE FUCKKKKKK??!!!!
---
Stonespine EU. I wouldn't suggest whispering the guy just don't group or open trade window with the guy. He definitely seems like the type to ninja at the end of a dungeon from my lovely conversation I had with him.
---
I believe there is a neck piece that allows you to see some of the townsfolk, or was part of a quest.
---
Used to play back in the day. Rolling spriest again. But honestly its just a buttload of practice.
---
There‚Äôs also the dagger that drops off rend but that‚Äôs such a low chance.
---
Its 15 minutes.  :)
---
I steal every tag and then force other people to join my group if they want credit.  Not going to put myself on their mercy to invite me.
---
Usually they end up killing the mob trying to steal it.
---
Check out \[Hunter Tutorial - Advanced Multishot Techniques\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcIibe7kZIo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcIibe7kZIo)), was a real eye opener for me.
---
That‚Äôs cool. You do you. I‚Äôve never been good at PvP and as I got older I got even slower. I just want to play the game without having to corpse walk every 15 minutes.
---
Does the same but specific damage (shadow, fire, frost or nature) or healing items have higher numbers.
---
For example let's pretend a ilevel 50 damage and healing item increased damage and healing by 40, then a healing item with ilevel 50 would be something like increase healing by 59.
---
Numbers taken out of my ass, just to clarify that there is a significant difference
---
Can you give a run down of your addons used?
---
Some dipshit on Ateish spams his portal service for 1.25g.
---
Who cares how long it takes you to be able to raid. You should be more worried about not having fun with the game.
---
Yes yes! that's the one, i just tried to install it but it seems the current version not working with classic?
---
 [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/omni-cc/files/all?filter-game-version=1738749986%3A67408](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/omni-cc/files/all?filter-game-version=1738749986%3A67408) 
---
This is the link I used
---
I can experience the world and still be going fast.
---
Good point, Felstriker is the best dagger pre-raid, but really low drop rate as you mentioned.
---
This reminds me of the big spider in Hinterlands, Shadra. I asked if it was soloable by lvl 52 lock, 3 players told me it is impossible, so I made a group.
---
The tank was certain he could hold aggro. I waited dps for 5 secs, went full out and got aggro so coiled into fear. The spider didn't get a single hit in.
---
I avoided him running into adds with Curse of Reckoning btw.
---
 Phase 3 is 15agi, phaes 5 is 25 agi. 
---
until then you use counterweight.
---
Not until they go out of season. My server they're swamped from people fishing them. Not enough guilds are raiding to effectively put a dent in the supply.
---
&gt;essentially if you ignore the animation, it's a chain lightning.
---
That's honestly a really helpful analogy. I never really thought of it like that, but I didn't put much time into Hunter in the early days of the game.
---
What is the xp/time tracker addons you're using?
---
thanks dude
---
[EU][N/A][Zandalar Tribe (but am happy to start anew)]
---
I have a 30 Horde Warrior currently on Zandalar Tribe... but I'm looking for a good guild to join, for leveling and eventually raiding. I'm a relaxed friendly and helpful player.
---
I was an old school Vanilla player who quit before TBC, and came back for WOTLK, quitting before the next exp again... Most of my high end raiding is Lich King, where my guild (and was core (tree) healer) did every raid.
---
I play a fair amount, and am pretty committed to getting back to raid-quality.... but I'd like to find a good group of people first. Don't mind server or side, I'd likely be rolling a new dude for it.
---
If it's a Stat weapon then yes a hunter should be able to need on it, otherwise hunters should pass if someone needs.
---
It's bullshit that people think that hunter should always pass for stuff like that, because for really good weapons there is always going to be someone that needs it... I am running into this problem with hand of justice... It is the BIS trinket for hunters, but we only get half the benefit from it. I feel really bad about taking it from a rogue, but after 100 runs and not being able to need it once, with melee get priority, enough is enough.
---
Ahh cable of thought.
---
Who cares how long it takes you to raid?
---
You're welcome, man!
---
One thing about Classic that's something to get used to is that there's no quest marker or arrow pointing you in the right direction.  So you have to read the quest carefully.
---
I also usually have a laptop open with wowhead loaded. Just type in the name of the quest and there's invariably a comment explaining what they did, map coordinates of an objective, etc.
---
Speaking of coordinates, a very handy addon is [TomTom](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom).When you read someone saying that "the chest you have to loot is at 64.21, 52.77", you go back to WoW and in the chat box type "/way 64.21, 52.77 chest to loot" (no quotes) and you'll get an arrow that points you in the right direction with a distance counter underneath it. It'll also put a dot on the map. That will put you right on top of the item, or at least in the general area.
---
And since I'm here, I'll mention another addon that boosts quality of life a lot: [Auctioneer](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctioneer). It will re-skin the auction house and add features that will fetch current prices and then auto-suggest the price you should list something at. Makes it WAY faster to post stuff to the AH, and for better prices.
---
The [screenshot page](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctioneer/screenshots) has some examples. 
---
Check out the PostFrame.jpg image. That's where you'll be most of the time. What you do is open the AH, then go to the Appraiser tab. You alt-click the "Refresh" button to update prices for everything in your bags. Once it's done scanning, you click the "Post" tab, alt-rclick an item in your bag to pop it up into the box in the upper left (you can also drag and drop stuff to the box in order to list it), make sure "undercut competitors" is checked, then click "Create Auction".  Just keep repeating that until everything is listed. Super fast.
---
One thing is that sometimes the Refresh button is grayed out. (You can only do it once per session.) In that case, when you have an item in the Post tab ready to be listed, you'll need to click the Refresh button there to scan for just the item you're currently listing.
---
Anyway, sounds a lot more complicated than it is, but it'll keep your pants from being pulled down at the auction house. Money is hard to come by early on, and this will help a lot. 
---
Speaking of which, when you get to the main city, ask a guard (NPCs sitting by doorways, etc.; there's a "chat bubble icon" when you mouse over them) where the profession trainers are. You get to choose two main professions and all three secondary ones (fishing, cooking and first aid). All three secondaries are worth grabbing. I personally find fishing to be really relaxing. Grab a beer and a book, find a quiet patch of shoreline, fish away.
---
For your first character, you don't want to pick a crafting profession as a main profession. You'll be poor for a very long time. Instead get two gathering professions. I'd recommend mining and skinning. Reason being that once you pick a gathering profession, you can "track" the nodes you can gather form, but you can only track one type. Skinning is nice early one because you'll kill a LOT of things that can be skinned. And you'll be able to skin other people's kills too. And it lets you track ore nodes which will show up as little yellow dots on the minimap.
---
On my server, the ore sells OK. I typically put it in the bank until the middle of the week, when fewer players are listing things for sale, which means things sell for a higher price than on the weekends. Leather you'll have to check and see whether you get more by selling to a vendor or on the auction house. It varies. Currently (Saturday morning) you'd likely want to vendor any skins you have since there's a lot for sale and everyone is undercutting everyone else, meaning it'll sell for more to a vendor. Or if you don't need the money right away, stuff it in your bank and sell it during the week. 
---
As you get a little more money, consider investing in larger bags. It makes life much easier. Also don't forget to sell junk in your bags whenever possible. Anything with an item name in gray should be sold to a vendor. Things with names in white sometimes get vendored. Things with names in green, blue, purple, or orange should be kept for the AH. 
---
The exception to that would be items that say they are "Bind on Pickup" (you'll see that as "BoP", with the other category of items being Bind on Equip or "BoE") that you can't use (a piece of plate armor when you're a Hunter, for example). Sometimes you just get stuff you can't wear. You can't put BoP items on the AH, so they can be vendored too. Always hang on to BoE gear with a colored item name and list it at least once. I got a sword at level 15 that I sold for almost two gold. I only had 5g total, so quite a bonus. I think it vendored for a few silver, so I'd have lost a decent chunk by vendoring it.
---
Anyway, that should be plenty to get you started. Sorry for writing a novel!
---
Done this a lot in vanilla. Also used to stealth and lava hop with anothe rogue and a druid to kill the Prince for the trinket. 
---
My best stealth feat ever tho was sneaking past the trash after Twin Emps to get my Pugio because my guild wouldn‚Äôt clear it. They all can see through stealth, but only in a frontal cone you basically have to run behind them and vanish, if anything hits you, you are one shot. It‚Äôs barely even possible, took me like 20 times of trial and error.
---
I‚Äôm not afraid to admit I was wrong.  Just a heads up, both your links go to the same place
---
30 i think?
---
I don't use any consumables yet I literally just hit 60 and i'm waiting to log on the warr when honor comes out hes in all like lvl 40-45 greens that i found off mobs lol.
---
Can this be done anywhere? Or only at AH
---
Shadow priests are insane in PvP, but they have a lot of mana issues in PvE which is why people don‚Äôt always take them in raids (similar to bomkins). At the end of the day, you should play what you want and think is fun. If you are a good player people will bring your to raids regardless of the spec/class.
---
I would recommend respeccing (if you can afford it) and starting in Holy for 5\5 Spiritual Focus (and possibly Consecration).  The difference in survivability is huge, and it's a solid base for a Ret or Prot leveling build.
---
Why? It's not 2007 you can see phone pics just fine.
---
We just looking out for you nasty boy. Imagine if one day you bring a girl in that filthy room. Clean that shit now.
---
Layering is causing issues with people attending it.
---
Except pally tanks
---
I AH the meat usually.
---
Right, and then in the madness some one kills the fucking flight master and all the NPCs you need to do your quests lol
---
they will just steel your freedom
---
I mean bear tank gearing is VERY specific and if you look at the list of their BIS items, there isn't actually that much overlap between rogue and bear
---
I can‚Äôt imagine blacklisting someone over one encounter like this some people are unreal
---
He is a gnome, but I also have that same name on my horde server as a bank alt :).
---
details added this just the other day
---
I just use elvui and it does everything.
---
20 days 8 hours here
---
Shapeshift mana is why you\`ve got Innervate!
---
Do you enjoy healing though? Because if tanking is really what you want to do... It's not too late to reroll war haha...
---
Only at AH and I think it‚Äôs only once per login as well.
---
Some people are more comfortable with their phones no reason to be condescending. As someone who only uses reddit on mobile I can see how it would be easier.
---
Either way I dont upload anything so just my 2 cents
---
Ok you just won it now. I'm going mining+engineering. Idk why but I didn't even think about like with my hunter I have leatherworking but almost all gear I drop is better than the gear I can craft. The same kind of applies to BS. Expensive crafting gear that ain't better than the gear I can drop. 
---
Thank you for opening my eyes lmao. &lt;3

It's not that you want spirit INSTEAD of intellect, but spirit (while leveling at least) has a higher stat priority because it buffs your mana and health regeneration rates.  It doesn't mean that you don't want intellect.  If you have the choice between a belt with 4 int and 5 spirit, and a belt with 5 int and 4 spirit, you probably should take the belt with more spirit.
---
Yes, epic at 60 too.
---
Also true
---
If I see a spellcaster in the area that I think is hostile or is making a B line towards me I'll equip it. It's definitely worth using
---
im not in charge of the guild and the reason we went with 37 is i believe because we just didnt have 40 people ready. And like i said many times now, yes we could just as well brought 3 meme specs with us. Would they be carried? Yes
---
People dont read what OP is asking for
---
It effectively is 1agi 2 AP don‚Äôt let that guy convince you otherwise. Truestrike are definitely better though.
---
OFF WITH YE!
---
Rule 3 says not to encourage witch hunts. It doesn't say anything about blurring names?
---
It‚Äôs really not a big deal, you can see what you need to see.
---
The issue with shadow priests in raids is mana. They run out of Mana pretty quick on most fights. They're valuable to bring alone for shadow weaving, but you only need one spreist for that, any more doesn't add anything.
---
Eh I never had gear issues.  Just cause you dip into leather and have 2nd prio on melee upgrades.
---
Every class dips for bis armor.  It'd be like claiming edgemasters isn't for warriors because it's mail.
---
Very cool
---
I promise you, they will run logs for a decent chunk of time around the creation of your ticket. Also, when submitting the ticket, it asks for the time, the item name, etc. They find the time boss dies then they look at the chat logs. Ez
---
20 days played, rich irl, you upset?
---
Don't do regular scans, do the fast one (double arrow top left)

It's bold of you to assume that I'm computer illiterate
---
&gt;I'd rather risk blacklisting someone who doesn't deserve it
---
That is a kinda assholish thing to do that also might bite you in the ass at some point.
---
Aha! thanks.
---
Pickpocketing was only a valid moneymaker on private servers. In Classic there are far better options for you, like coffer runs or Archmage Robes pattern farming, etc.
---
Enjoy your bussy and roids bro and your crusty red shorts
---
It still hits pretty hard when its applied, but it can (and should) be interrupted.
---
There is definitely a lack of gear in some departments especially for ranged weapons, but there is also the issue of their pets not scaling with their damage. For a hunter, 10-20% of your damage never goes up as you get gear so naturally you fall behind the other classes that get the full benefits of their items. :/
---
Also it might be ClassicLFG too.
---
Might have more luck in the warrior discord
---
That's som looney tunes shit
---
No, OP took the screenshot so OP is in the middle, in the background.
---
I mean, it's a clever pun but it's still obviously sex related. C'mon you know that was cumming.
---
Not really. The highest concentration of people that are going to be buying these high end items are already 60. Each group of players that takes longer is less and less likely to buy things like devilsaur.
---
And he never got another sunburn for the rest of his life
---
On you too! For a fee of course...
---
Embarrassed?  On the internet?  No that‚Äôs for people who don‚Äôt hide their roid use and end up on worlds most shriveled dick.
---
Oh, I know.
---
But, I was in the big wave of people trying to get to 60 which for a large part made competition for quest objectives inefficient.
---
So I ground out XP in dungeons. As a bonus, I was nearly complete pre-bis when I hit 60. I was just broke.
---
And homogeneity is boring as hell. 
---
It's a common problem with lazy mobile games too. Play this class or that class and you get to do basically the same thing as everyone else, just with slightly different colors. Woo.
---
Thanks for sharing this with us, you added a ton of value to this sub today.
---
You know what, you're right. I think the toxicity on this sub is rubbing off and making me a jerk. Sorry.
---
I sell mats to my guildies for a 5% discount.

I would argue that the runecloth was an act of ninjaing. I'm more interested in keeping incidents like this in a concise location that is easily searched.
---
Ha! Hurtme is me. I said wow because I tanked the mobs that spawn from the grave with a group for the quest and died. Then they removed me from the group so I couldnt even loot the mob and finish the quest because it despawned when I rezzed. However, they all completed the quest. Ugh I'm still salty about it.
---
Didnt even offer to help me redo it. Those are the real plague spreaders!
---
You are playing a healer class. Get healing gear and spec into holy and everything will be fine.
---
26 shaman, same thing.
---
Though I did have a kidney stone for a week or two there.
---
Blizzard said most servers are &lt;5 in a blue post a while back I seem to think.
---
My server has 4 I'd guess.
---
What's the addon he is using for chat and nameplates ?
---
Eh, if they're just standing around they have no business expecting any kind of tip.
---
This is coming from a warlock who goes out of their to summon people if they whisper me and expects/takes nothing
---
I'd recommend getting the TSM desktop application, it automatically keeps the addon up to date and gets realm data if you login. 
---
Make an account [Here](https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/user/register), then find the Install TSM page, from there it's just download and follow the instructions.
---
Sure pal
---
Worgs are just puppies! Big, fluffy, giant-fanged puppies!
---
You are totally fine at that level, Stockades is an interested dungeon as it has almost no item drops. So make sure you grab all the quests.

Here is a link to a google sheets with all dungeon quests
---
Yeah I agree will all your points. I would even say that it's borderline against tos to reserve items and not let people know, but I guess it depends on how malicious you are about it. Now days, it never hurts to ask the RL to explain loot rules in game before pulling.
---
Wait, why is spell damage and +healing not mentionned?
---
&gt;they weren't able to gank me with their 5 levels advantage...
---
Let me guess: you were a mage vs a warrior?
---
Basically most of the retail world chat before Classic release, I remember that more than well. They didn't even give Classic one month, they were straight up saying it will die two weeks after the release and look where we are now. They must be extremely mad.
---

---
Got my first taste of pvp there as alliance. Went in and killed 7 or so players in a row and was riding a high when a shaman my level walks up and two shots me.
---
Beautiful picture mate. Where did you take your dog? Mind to give me a hint?
---
Isn't onycia on a 5 days reset though?
---
=)
---
Yang Gang!
---
Fun fact:  Spell batching was present during vanilla, but wasn't a thing in classic until a bunch of people pitched a fit about it.  So then blizzard went back and devised a way to simulate it - and that's what we have now . If you don't like spell batching, you have this very community to blame.
---
Haha, just a little! Thank you :)
---
58-59 feels the worst
---
This is dope!!
---
Yep, they're not found the same way as live TSM is, something to do with how blizzard lets you pull game data, but it's better than nothing.
---
Another reason not to use multi-shot is because if you use it too early from the pull you will give the tank a hard time. As he now has to make sure he has enough threat on multiple mobs way earlier than he should have to worry about it.
---
I think you would be surprised. As a rogue i am also frequently in the top spot. On normal pulls I‚Äôm typically tied for the top spot, but every third pull all the mobs die in about the time my blade flurry ends and I destroy the meters. Rogues have really good burst damage on normal pulls because things generally don‚Äôt live very long. Those extra attacks from being looked at 100 energy really do throw around a lot of burst. However, if a pull goes wrong and we pull extra mobs then the fight lasts a lot longer and that burst damage slows down a lot. That‚Äôs the only time my dps really starts to suffer.
---
I like the fact that it forces me to socialize and say ding 40 or ding 60 or link an epic I just got to share my success or excitement. People says gratz etc. I get to choose what's important to me. Achievement take out my choice and make it more common because there's almost an achievement for everything. I don't like achievements the way they are in retail. They do nothing for me. Maybe if there were less achievements and they were more meaningful that would be cool.
---
Yea, but from what I've seen hunter dps isn't that lacking endgame. Mostly cause you can go full out dps  and fd for an aggro complete drop. Where rogues have to limit their dps otherwise they will pull aggro
---
Aux
---
I am also running into more players that expect assistance without returning anything in kind (not payment or anything, but sharing/grouping for quests...no I will not help you clear mobs after you tagged the one we both needed and did not invite me).
---
Your'e welcome
---
Stuff like this is pretty common with door prefabs, this is usually an error to do with the camera mistaking that you‚Äôre not visible and not rendering your position in game. This is pretty standard optimisation in games (what the player can‚Äôt see is stored in memory but not actively rendered to save resources). Your client thinks you‚Äôre hidden, but you‚Äôre obviously in plain sight.
---
This is also common in caves, even in retail. A mining node will spawn inside one, but when you enter it, it will disappear but still show in the map. The client doesn‚Äôt think you can see it. However if it‚Äôs a shallow cave, you can move your camera out of the cave and the mining node will suddenly appear again.
---
This makes me so proud of my Irish heritage
---
I hate when people take everything to an extreme, the nochange thing was stupid and this is coming from someone who absolutly loves vanilla
---
Depends. If, like me, you can barely play more than 20 hours a week (and that's a good week), that represents at least 2 to 3months of work.
---
Difference in view then. If they were at level cap and you had empty spots then some contribution beats none. An average player on a good spec can easily do worse than a better player on a meme spec.
---
Anyone managed this as a priest? There's a video from private servers, but in that video she basically spams the aoe with little delay inbetween, which makes her trivial to kite. When I tried, she reaches me and almost one-shots if I don't have a shield up.
---
&gt;Everyone asks ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs Rexxar?‚Äù

Hell yeah. The community aspect of classic wow is my absolute favorite thing. I think that once the downfall of wow began, that's the only thing that kept me playing. I even switched factions just to play with friends and when they all stopped and the community became toxic or non-existent I quit for what seemed for good. I never really gave BfA a shot.
---
I'm calling bullshit on you, I was playing BFA before classic ,while doing so I rarely saw anyone mention classic .the few time I saw it mentioned ,it was just a mud slinging competition between trolls
---
Wtf is a sun?
---
My favorite dungeon ever was in WoTLK with a multiboxer who tanked and healed. He had a female dwarf priest as his healer and he verbally abused her the entire time. Sometimes he would forget her in another room (WoTLK dungeons were a joke) and yell at her until she caught up.
---
Intellect increases your mana pool and your spell crit chance, both good stats for burst healing.
---
Spirit increases health/ mana regeneration. Important for being able to heal consistently for an extended time.
---
When you're healing a dungeon or a raid, Consistency &gt; Burst
---
Garrrote gives you 1 or 2 combo points based on your initiative talent
---
ahh ok. i would have gone insane grinding XP in dungeons. even as a mage i disliked aoe grinding/spell cleave groups. i also got very lucky on some of the BiS gear in the few runs i did. (also made sure to make groups that didnt have any casters to compete on the gear i needed lol). still working on some slots but im not rushing it too much. im about 2/3 BiS now.
---
it took me longer to get to 60 overall, but i got my epic mount not long after hitting 60.

You need to press the Print Screen key on your keyboard and then paste it into Microsoft Paint.

Actually killing him sure under 3min. But in addition you have to wait on the bridge while his slow ass waddles around in the water for another 2-3 minutes potentially. At that point it isn't worth it.

It's not easy to get a group to RFK because the only reason anybody is running it from alliance is Corpsemaker and only Warrs and Paladins can use it.
---
Nobody wants to make the trek there, I've been trying to get a group going for 3 days and only got one which consisted of 2 warriors and 2 paladins so we just had to 4man it because nobody else wanted to come.
---
Sure it ain't yout duty to help just because you can but you might make somebody's life easier just with a certain drop.
---
You ok bud?
---
Check out Twitch C9 Kala and Hydramist for sure. Hydramist has a site  (https://deathblind.com/) with tons of good guides and videos.
---
I can only really give general advice.
---
The priority is Revenge -&gt; Sunder -&gt; Heroic Strike. Best threat to rage cost. Always try to pop Shield Block to make sure Revenge is up and to help healers.
---
But here's the biggest thing. Do not over threat. You don't need to spam 10,000 sunders on a mob no one is hitting and even on the one people are on you don't have to go ham. If something is at around 15% HP don't waste Rage on it to save it for the next pull or next mob. If someone pulls off and the mob is about to die either taunt it so its just hitting you while it dies or if it's not a hard hitting enemy let them tank the last few % points and go to the next mob.

Hey quick question how did u get SpartanUI to work? If downloaded it of off numerous sites and haven‚Äôt gotten it to work!?
---
Until you get to the endgame it is indeed harder, but the dungeons and raids are laughably easy compared to their mythic counterparts.
---
Sigh, Thog fears he may never again know the majesty of the Gumdrop Mountains.
---
I consider that a feature ;)
---
yes it doesnt matter who you are, im just saying if its a melee heavy grp wich is most of the time atm cause of the way lower drop chance of the MH on rend, they don't want to be bothered with constant resetting to check for jed. it isn't rare for a 7 man grp to not get jed withing their resets limit
---
You've seen a screenshot without context and immediately come to the conclusion that he does this all the time and that he didn't stop afterwards. I am not sure what else I should say to that.

There was a step where this happened back in Vanilla/TBC Orgrimmar too, which I used to use (being a gnome warlock) when I wanted to mess with people in Org.

He could prefer fire for the other 90% of content.

Last night I jumped down into the bug hive in Un'Goro and my pet was unable to find a path to me even though I could walk right over to it. Had to dismiss it just to get it off the textured ground or whatever. Pathetic.

All you can see is my monitor but nice try ;) my girlfriend of four years begs to differ. You that bad at arguing? Just gunna stick to the messy room thing? Basing your opinion of the monitor of a retired 10 year old laptop that I don't even care if it breaks at this point? Just shows me you've got nothing. I thought Reddit had better troll's than this.
---
In my opinion, leveling is mostly what the game is all about. A long journey. I like taking my time enjoying the game and experience new things as time comes
---
Okay real talk. Leveling as a balance druid, can I tank still as long as I have a tank set with me? Or is this a reeeeeeeeaally bad idea? I just want to be a moonkin
---
It'll obviously depend on how often an item sells in general, but a rough way of measuring that is just keeping an eye on how many times you have to list it. Take cloth for example. Extremely useful material, should sell pretty much immediately every time. If it doesn't sell within listing it a couple of times, I stop trying and either vendor it or keep it with me to try again a couple of days later or maybe at a different time.
---
I was never saying the OP did or not did not do anything wrong. All I was saying is I can confirm companies do sometimes mess things up. In my case Jagex almost certainly believed they were correct because I‚Äôm pretty sure my account would‚Äôve been botting. In the case of the OP there‚Äôs less to go on, and i would probably guess something suspicious was going on with his account. It would be very rare for there to be a ban with absolutely nothing going on.

Keep in mind that while Mining/ Herbalism can be more lucrative than Mining/ Skinning, you can't track both mining nodes and herbs at the same time on your minimap. You will have to remember to switch back and forth occasionally. Skinning doesn't require any tracking, so you can track nodes full time.

Hahahaha, sure. You know what's my experience on retail when I was doing 8.2.5. stuff? World chat completely dead with one guy spamming about their boosting group (world chat on my realm was always active even during content droughts, I didn't even see usual trolls I used to chat with for years), 5 people online in my guild during prime time. Tried few rated arenas and oh boy, 3 minutes waiting time on 2k cr. 
---
So yeah, this is experience from someone who has been playing retail until Classic launched. And about friendlist, I have still more people playing Classic. I've noticed the only people who play retail are the ones who didn't even try Classic in the first place. But hey, maybe my experience is just completely different from yours.

I got him good though, right?

I've seen lots of comments on here of people saying that Void is underwhelming.

My raptor was following me down a hill that had a tree overhanging the path and as I ran under the branch he went over and got stranded on the top of the foliage. Looked funny, like he was too scared to jump the 2ft to the ground and too stupid to turn around and go back.

I'll remember not to gank them

I used to be just like the people in this thread until I was falsely banned in overwatch for 2 weeks for *literally* no reason. My multiple attempts to appeal were met with a full battle.net account suspension for 5 days. Hope you can get your suspension reversed if your story is true (if it is true and they don't reverse I'd Def look at a charge back). Good luck

If a rogue acquired + spell damage, or + nature damage, would it increase their poison damage.
---
Shadow priests are garbage in endgame PvE.  There are 4 problems: 
---
1) mana -- no mana recovery options in fights, so anything lasting longer than 30 seconds will require pots and dark runes/demonic runes.  
---
2) debuff slots -- most guilds will take all 16 debuff slots with higher priority stuff than shadow word pain and mind flay, and even if not, it doesn't make sense to bring a shadow priest that needs 2 debuff slots to even function when they can just have their locks use corruption.  
---
3) poor scaling -- they don't benefit from crit and their spell coefficients are very low. 
---
4) threat (mind blast) -- double threat, meaning you have to watch threat even though you'll be low on the damage meters
---
Wasn't there a dev interview that said they tried to have hunters use focus in the alpha (maybe beta), but couldn't get it working smoothly so they switched to mana at the 11th hour?
---
I prefer mana for kiting, but focus for sustained dps. I think I liked the BC method the best where attacks from the pet caused you to gain mana.
---
We're all allowed to have our own opinion! I can see you clearly understand that and I thank you for having a level head.
---
I read reddit when I poop :)
---
He's saying that raid leaders use it on voice comm i.e "Who can douse runes?" or "Who's up for ZG after ony?" and request people just type + if they can/want to do the thing. Because you always have that fucking joker who says "me" and no one knows who the fuck it is. 
---
His argument seems to be that this tradition of using + to indicate you're up for something just becomes habit so when "who wants to do ZF?" is written, their response is still just "+".
---

Lol never reserved loot before but I'm certainly going to start now :^)
---
That's... Kind of a weird "attack" when I'm just making a joke about not liking twitch. Do you truly need /s on every comment with sarcasm to be able to detect it?
---
Try not to be a vile person. You don't like the stupid joke I made about twitch being pointless so downvote me. 
---
You might want to check into your personality issues and insecurities
---
It is though, actually.  We will just have to agree to disagree.  BRD was my favorite dungeon ever.  I don't think I'm mistaken.  I played true vanilla, I played on Nost (actually ran a full clear the night before Most got shut down), played Elysium/lights hope, ran it more times than I'd like to admit as a rogue, a tank, and a holy paladin.  I'm pretty sure the heal is enough to fuck groups up.
---
Even if they dont reserve if youre a pick up in a mostly raid group they can still be scummy and trade loot for 2hours (:
---
I didn't think people were looking that closely. Been playing for years and only just now noticed.
---
Undermine is mentioned, it was supposed to be a WoW zone. Classic+?
---
Pretty much all abilities trigger a global cooldown. Afaik the exceptions are Warrior stances which are on their own cooldown, and Druid forms which trigger no cooldown of any sort. Maybe Hunter aspects as well?
---
To reiterate - SOLO content, not in dungeons my shaman dudes.
---
That worg is actually licking it's chops because it's about to feast on some prime rib.
---
No, the idea is that the community balances itself out. So what you do is tell everyone you know that that guy is an awful person. They tell their friends etc. If all goes well that guy ends up so fucked that he has to create a new char because his name is tainted on the entire server. Of course this would work on 3k vanilla servers, it probably won't on the layered mega servers we have now.
---
Shadow can heal all the dungeons pre-60 dude....sounds like your group just sucked.
---
Man, I've played retail for years but I feel I made a mistake making my first Classic character a hunter
---
If you are doing spellcleave clears, I would recommend 44 as the lowest person in your group. This will help you in regards to face pull aggro radius. 46 will be your power spike as you get your next rank of arcane explosion.
---
My mage is currently leveling enchanting and and tailoring. I'm thinking of making an alt to level engineering on and giving what I craft to my main for PvP. Do I lose any engineering viability this way or will I still be able to take full advantage of what I craft for PvP?

I'm a 40 priest levelling with a 38 rogue and we got jumped twice yesterday by higher level players (first by 40 Mage and 47 shaman and second a 39 warlock and 45ish warrior) and we won both times. We must have been lucky to run into the 4 worst players in the zone because how did they fuck that up.
---
Impossible, I'm an American
---
Stupid stalker addons, this is Classic for gods sake!
---
To me, there's quite a few things involved.
---
A shadow spec healer can heal a dungeon fine if.
---
1. They healer has decent gear.
---
2. The tank is the right spec
---
3. The tank has decent gear
---
4. The DPS don't do anything retarded
---
5. The DPS have solid dmg
---
To me, everything is likely fine if you can manage at least 3/5 of those. The problem is that doing leveling dungeons all of that isn't true. Maybe the tank only has a few prot talents because he's mostly Arms spec. Maybe the priest is wearing 3 quest greens from 20 levels ago. Maybe the groups hunter is three levels too low for the dungeon and your groups DPS is suffering.
---
Its like most things in WoW. You CAN get away with a lot of non-optimal builds, specs, and gear but all that crap adds up.
---
totes adorbs
---
Not sure why, people seem to just hate it.
---
I got it off of the twitch client along with Bartender4 and I'm using the classic theme. Basically went category by subcategory adjusting settings until it worked how I wanted it to. What part of SpartanUI are you having trouble with?
---
This is also my plan.
---
Thanks. Rockbiter generates way too much threat to be good in dungeons for sure.
---
So it's not just me then, I hadn't heard of anyone else having this bug.

If the meat is selling for a good price then good but in my experience most meat isn‚Äôt selling for much above vendors price. Market is saturated from everyone leveling

**Hunter Pet Speed**

Will a pet with 2.0 speed do as much damage as a pet with 1.2?
---
I'm under the impression that they do the same DPS because the 2.0 will hit harder than the 1.2.
---
actually I havent seen a legolas in a long time, back in the day 80% of any ranged focus character on any MMO would be named a variant of legolas

---
Most of the useful things you can make with Engineering require you to have a minimum Engineering skill to use or equip them. Throium Grenades require 260 Engineering skill to use, for example.
---
Then you have long lost it already unfortunately.
---
Really sorry guys, I did not want to offend anyone. I should not have written that BiS stuff, I was just happy to tame that beast. Everyone should play the game as it feels good, there is no need for anyone for trying to justify that his/her playstyle is the best, and bully others who do not think so.
---
I got my mount at 40.5 so it's not unachievable. You just can't spend money on stupid things like every skill or AH gear every level or other such things.

Stam and int are gonna be your friends, rank 2 conc is the goto for threat. But this all depends on your level.
---
Spell casters can really mess up a paladin, so coordinating the right aura when you get it.
---
As well as tanking basics, green mobs are the best to tank. And your holy damage from seal of right will be more threat.
---
 ?? lvl orc warrior gnked me repeatedly while I was doing blood troll scalps for Windfury weapon. Then another orc warrior comes with his lvl 45 rogue partner while we\`re waiting for our AFK priest and chatting right next to Blindwatcher.  They summon Cyclonian, kill him, eat then charge us and kill both. Such horde. Much honor.

I‚Äôve downloaded it off curseforge and that along with some other Addons don‚Äôt show up. Some do and some just don‚Äôt. Then for example I had details! Working then I downloaded the new updated one and it won‚Äôt work for me anymore. I always make sure to get the 1.13.2 classic wow files but it‚Äôs always just up in the air if it actually shows up for me. I use a Mac and drag the files into my addon folder if that helps!
---
Right away sir.

Rogues can vanish

In multiple instances of posts being locked by Rule 3 the mods have stated the revealing the character name and server is not allowed. Check the detailed rules for rule 3 and it will explain.
---
If you want to spend 60 gold for a barely noticeable difference in a proc, why are you asking us for advice?
---
i got mine shortly after hitting 60. i sold a decent amount of herbs while leveling and never bought anything. sold everything i could and vendored the rest. hit 60 with around 700-750g.
---
never got anything worth more than 20g other than black lotus/mooncloth. lot of nickel and diming and vendoring. just dont spend money on boes and you can get it pretty quickly.
---
I /followed a rando part of the way from stormwind to redridge. But i didn't think to tip him.
---
What level are you soloing SFK at
---
Actions speak louder than words.
---
He sounds like a 12 year old to be honest
---
Yeah was a joke but I love harvesting all the downvotes, salty tears from all the mages I just pissed off :\^)
---
I take my time and enjoy...  If you enjoyed all the way there is no point in beeing sad about missing naxx.
---
sounds brazilean
---
that's their culture, just take whatever you can from everyone. they don't shame each other for it, so it becomes the norm
---
same thing with those african scammers. they elevate people who scam people successfully, so it becomes a thing
---
Just say lol even though you didn't actually lol.
---
Or wait some weeks to a month and sell them for at least 1500g. These are BIS forever. 700g.. lol.
---
Someone linked a video above that explained a lot of the randomness I thought happened with multishot. It actually functions like chain lightning so it hits your primary target then the target closest to that. If there's a third target close enough to the second target you'll hit that too. I always wondered why sometimes it wouldnt hit a mob right next to my target and sometimes it would fly out of my right shoulder but the explanation makes sense.
---
Spriest would have been the best choice for undergeared caster with dots but still competitive throughout classic!
---
join a dead server like mine, takes about 2 mins to scan the AH
---
Who were the original plague spreaders? The ones who put it in the wells along trade routes?
---
Also a possibility.
---
And it was a female pandaren into a worgen.
---
I have trust issues with female pandaren players because of stuff like this. I know a few who are the nicest people but the ones I meet randomly are complete nutters without fail.
---
Resource management is hard
---
I haven‚Äôt posted a phone pic of a screen yet, but I could see why someone might.  I use reddit on my phone exclusively.  It would literally take me ten minutes to log into reddit on my computer, because I don‚Äôt even remember my password.
---
So I‚Äôd have to open my email (also on my phone, so I‚Äôve probably forgotten that password; which means resetting that to another email that I‚Äôve probably forgotten the password for..), reset the reddit password, and then log in ... and by the time I‚Äôve done all of that ... I can understand why someone might quickly snap a phone pic, load it, and get on with their lives.
---
Besides ... screenshots are sooooo 2018, friend.
---
Blizzard wouldn't say that. Multiboxing is allowed if you own your own accounts.
---
Sorry your experience has been shitty man. I‚Äôve been kicked or denied groups for being a hunter too but there‚Äôs always a slew of guilds around to join and group up that way. Shit sucks but there are a few different ways to battle this sort of thing. But it‚Äôs better to have make it know that you‚Äôre rolling for something rather than being accused of ninja‚Äôing loot because you needed something as a hunter. It‚Äôs how I look at it at least.
---
Still a bad idea save shield for casters. Mobs dont like to hit absorbs.
---
Redridge is perhaps the most brutal early game leveling area, all the mobs in the entire region bunch up. You need a group for the gnolls here. Find a mage who needs a tank and let them DPS for you.
---
It is not. Those names are on Grobb en masse. 
---
I pass many (NOTE: THESE NAMES ARE JUST VAGUE EXAMPLES NOT WORD FOR WORD NAMES) "bankaltz" and "bgchggn" and "cutenthicc" character pretty much on the reg. I'd say it's close to 50/50 between stupid non-rp names and people with good names. I heard you can report non RP names, but it's been weeks and I have someone on my friends list that I still play with occasionally named "pizzdribbls" and I told him day 1 that I was going to report him every single time I grouped with him for his name. He laughed and said it's fine he deserves it. We're shocked he hasn't been forced to change his name yet.
---
You can still tank pretty much up to 60 as any spec.
---
Boomkin is an extreme uphill battle in Classic. Not very viable in Raids or most PvP situations.

Classic: Congratulation on 60! Now go do two sets of 20 quest long chains that involve word travel on your 60% mount and multiple visits to dungeons and a raid. Then run as many dungeons as possible so you can get the necessary gear needed to do your first 40 man raid, oh and you‚Äôll have to hoof it to each one. Now that you‚Äôve completed your first set you‚Äôre going to need to farm for another one with fire resistance, you‚Äôll need about 100-200 unbuffed. Don‚Äôt forget to grind for materials needed for potions, food buffs, and other necessary buffs you‚Äôll find in varying zones around the world. Oh and good luck getting 40 people together. By the way you not get much gear from it since you‚Äôll be raiding with 39 other people, so have fun doing this every week for the next year.
---
Retail: Congratulations on 120! Press i and select your dungeon. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll teleport you there. Oh, and we know that NASA taught a chimp what buttons to press to go into space but we‚Äôre going to pretend that the button sequences needed to do Mythic+ is difficult and not simply a gear check. Oh, you rolled need on that and you didn‚Äôt actually need it, and now you‚Äôve been kicked. Don‚Äôt worry, just press i again and do it over, you‚Äôll never see those people again or be held accountable.
---
If you're gonna wear it, roll need
---
I‚Äôm glad you are enjoying it. As a warrior especially it can get rough leveling. Basically have to eat or bandage after every pull. I‚Äôm at 60 on mine and I was so happy to stop leveling. Not that I hated it but it was just slow and a big grind. Nothing like leveling something like a mage or hunter. 
---
As for the game itself, Classic is slow and a big RPG world. Retail is like an arcade game. Instant gratification and big numbers. Everything is easy and you do lots of dps. Classic is the opposite.
---
That's the beautiful thing: I'll never know.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dajh0e/had_some_lucky_coincidence_today_whats_up_with/).

His name is literally I CAMPED YOU..
---
..and his twat's itchy after being ganked. Lol
---
This is like the exact opposite of what happened to me today. Asked in gchat if any tailors were on cause i had saved up enough mageweave to upgrade my bags. Guy says he is a tailor, but he o ly has supplies on him to make runecloth bags, i had enough gold to buy them so i asked how much he wanted for them... he gave me 4 runecloth bags for free! Totally made my day. Im glad i didn't just join a random guild that was recruiting and waited to be recruited to one by people who kept seeing/grouping with me as we leveled.
---
If it's a single quest mob, do it with the grp. The guildie coming to help would have to still wait for the respawn which would take more time
---
Links are dead btw. At least link to the guide.
---
Theres a checkmark on leatrix to enable the wide quest log as well if you use that addon.
---
It's somewhat of a holdover insult from when the only people playing Vanilla WoW were people on private servers. Folks would be ready to pile on the bandwagon of hating on retail, so if they met someone who "didn't get" this version of the game they would be the target of a lil barbing.
---
It really isn't new either, people adore being the most authentic - the term Wrath Babies was the first one I remember being widely touted. Everyone who had played since Vanilla or TBC had this penchant to sort of look down on anyone who never saw the Vanilla-&gt;TBC world. The same way some Senior in Highschool kinda looks down on the lower classes because they "don't get it yet" or someone in a club of some kind who has been there before everything changed - folks just naturally will consider those with less experience as being slightly diminished compared to themselves.
---
Im not sure you read my comment, I‚Äôm in favour of it being gated but please read my comment again.
---
I'm was pretty sure rogues had something to that effect maybe not an agro drop but something that lowers their threat
---
I dont want to carry someone in a meme spec. Its disrespectful for everyone that choose a spec for pushing the guild forward.
---
A ret, elemental, boomkin or enhancement should have just played healer. They will bring the same utility (sometimes even more) and also contribute themselves.
---
The different utility they bring does not outweight them having a meme spec.
---
Are there any online resources that can tell me if an item is worth auctioning? I have the Auctioneer addon installed but it tells me to vendor most green items. I put a green item up for auction yesterday and made 1 gold so now I'm curious.
---
I was just about to come edit the comment to "I'm going mining/skinning". Can't track mining nodes and herbs so I'm going skinning til \~40.
---
There's a program called "on top replica" it's a little different than the extension but you can do more with it imo
---
In end game you'd just be a damage boost for the warlocks and cast cheap spells to keep it up
---
Okie dokie
---
We gotta get on that bug fix ASAP!
---
I wouldn't worry too much about your gear going into it. If you do spec Prot and your friend specs Holy, you will be fine with whatever gear you have as long as you do those dungeons at the appropriate level.
---
Wows currency is one number that makes up copper, silver, and gold.
---
1000 gold is more like
---
1000 00 00
---
Still a big freaking number though.
---
What's her dogs name?
---
That wasn't his arm! ;)
---
The sound of group buffs going out is one of the best sounds in the game.
---
I did this in the early 2000's when i was still living at my moms. I took my bed out of the room, played wow on a lazyboy, and slept there for about 4 years until i moved out on my own. 10/10 would do it again. As i age, i appreciate a nice mattress instead.
---
Dwarf mage?
---
thanks))
---
Your comment history is actually pathetic, how many times has the man baby been ganked that he spends all his time shitting on people on the classic wow subreddit? Read through your shit you wrote for the past week and have some self awareness, because that shit is cringe as fuck.
---
Should be the other way around lol
---
All the best to you aswell.
---
I Just want to point out i m not excluding anyone. I am Just setting terms for them to join the raid.
---
I am not asking People to do things i dont do myself. You cannot also not compare it to some sort of ingame racism because what i ask of People outside of the raid (spec, consumes, etc) is stuff everyone can get in this game.
---
Sometimes my melee attacks are my quiver as well. I bug reported both of them.
---
Yeap, Tanaris is a freaking bloodbath. I kinda miss STV now.
---
In the context of your comment I replied to, there was a chance he hadn't used it in that fight and broken cc. You replied that even so you would rather blacklist than take the chance of being "defrauded". We're talking about possibly breaking cc...
---
Are you just ignoring context now?
---
Well if you didn‚Äôt need a GD tank to begin with we wouldn‚Äôt have to cross spec like that. 
---
But it should always be mentioned up front what their motives and plans are as far as rolling on gear is concerned.
---
I wonder how many times Jaina has died in vlassic so far.
---
My dots alone have never pulled aggro off of my void even when I didn't have 3/3 imp voidwalker. CoA, Corruption, SL, and Immolate together don't pull aggro.
---
I can pull aggro if I'm also continually using drain life, but it usually takes a couple drains. If I replace CoA with CoS, the VW will just hold aggro.
---
Like Black Disciple King Dave? I thought he died from liver complications
---
I‚Äôve seen this ALOT. Overall it‚Äôs very frustrating. To be honest I try and avoid it now, I play a Rogue so I know I share Loot for the most part but I see them need on just about everything that isn‚Äôt Mail (Obviously) but I have had a few arguments with them now, not all Druids do this at all, but there has been a fair amount now, at least enough for me to avoid recruiting a Druid Tank if I can help it.
---
They do the same damage, the benefit to faster pets is spell push back. More melee hits, longer to cast for an enemy player.
---
Ah yes, the pre 20 optimism. 
---
Come back when you hit the real grind, lad.
---
whats his name so we can know not to trust him.
---
Well i cant argue with logic
---
I think even the communication is against tos since you cant use any translater either.
---
I tried it at 40. Do not recommend. If anything, just stay in caster form and do starfire/moon fire/insect swarm and then either cat or bear.
---
Yeah. How about if I just want to /dance in org?
---
Yeah but why would blizz devs make currency a signed integer?  It's never negative.
---
What the fuck is a VAC ban?
---
You\`re immune to sheeping when in animal form. Shapeshifting makes you break root, incluing frost nova and dispell slows (better to use your travel form for that - it costs less mana). Get your bear charge ASAP - it\`s your gap closer. Furor (in Nature) is great too - it gives you just enough rage to BEAR CHARGE someone as soon as you shapeshift into bear.
---
#DruidTanksMatter
---
I want to be a giant chicken with a dagger though :(
---
Yes, but realistically no. In 9999/10000 cases you will be fine, you have to do some really scetchy shit to usually get picked up by their systems.
---
I used to share the same battle net account with 5 ppl for several years (separate wow accounts on the same battle net account). We even asked blizzard if this was OK and they just said that they would not fix it for us (essentially telling us it was OK).
---
I can also add we made this decision before real name bnet became a thing
---
Make a thread
---
2edgy4me
---
I just read them and it just says to be conscious about revealing character names?
---
Play the game how you want and ignore people who tell you how to play, they have no other interest by their own. If you do however chose to tank you will be able to pick and choose who you play with.
---
rogues have feint and vanish lol, hunters are far outclassed in dps in endgame
---
Addons like that are so freaking annoying for people in the party who don't want the quests.
---
Please don't.
---
Well said
---
Are you talking about cc in general or sheep? Lol
---
Rogue: "meep meep*vanish*"
---
I spit my drink out. Damnnnnn.
---
Instead of saying,  ahh shit my bad... ‚Äúwas just on auto pilot mode‚Äù or something like that.... just straight up lie through your teeth!
---
like i said im not in charge but i dont think we have meme specs in the guild. there arte arguments to be made to not bring one though. they contribute less but need the same amount of healing as anyone else for instance. do they get loot? if yes then they might not have slowed us down this time but they did for the next time because someone elso could be contributing more with that item then the meme spec
---
For rogues, most main attacks are based on the weapon damage, so  a dagger with zero stats and high damage/slow weapon speed can be better than something with a good activated ability and stats.  This is by far the easiest one to get as a rogue before raiding.  
---
There are better, and a nice option once AV is out is the exalted rep dagger the lobotomizer, but thats a few phases away and will take however long it takes to get max reputation vs potentially a 5‚Äì10 minute stealth and solo kill in BRD.
---
Haha no, irl fishing and gold. These guys log in and work for 6 hours a day though.
---
I‚Äôm new to locks but I just got my fel hunter. When do I use him? I thought void walker for leveling.
---
Whish I could farm those elementals, they are immune to my arcane wand :(
---
And you're just a stupid hunter multishotting a mob that's not being tanked just to cast your spell.
---
Just don't let this one toolbag aka bad experience deter you from going out of your way to help someone else in the future, not everyone is a prick :D
---
Oh I see he's also getting this bug where melee attacks queue up until the mob is in range. Guess I'll try again when I have a break to spec shadow.
---
Then you have made the right choice. Boomkin dance is top tier.
---
There is a quest there that gives casters some really good shoulders that can last you until your late 40s.
---
Im never going help some low level do some irrelevant dungeon and get some loot they will replace in a few lvls. if you spent 3 days trying to get a group, you could have gotten past lvl 40 already.
---
I believe it\`s yeti cave in Feralas.
---
Represent! My female Tauren hunter is currently lvl 54
---
lol, I have to remember this one for my sister the next time the whole vaccination thing comes up at sunday dinner.  Sure to go over well.
---
You could toggle the ‚Äúremember me‚Äù option (there goes your point), take screenshots with a 3rd party app that uploads then automatically and literally copy/paste the URL then make the post. It‚Äôs faster on a desktop.
---
no its exactly the same. someone posts a list too show you how much exp you end up getting.
---
and someone response is "not useful", at no point did the post say it was useful information, its just a matter of fact. this is what you end up grinding.
---
my example is someone posting pictures of there dog and the response is "not a dragon". nothing about the post said anything bout dragons. its about one persons dogs, yet they herp and derped it and here we are.
---
in effect, a person came in looking for B, found A and then decided to chastise the other person for not giving them B when they wernt promised anything more then A.
---
Were they... background vocals for a bald headed mage?
---
lol I'm glad to see so many of the community have tricked themselves into thinking they deserve more than anyone else because "economics".
---
You need a group to accomplish anything too. 
---
You go ahead and demand shit in order to do content you were gonna do anyways, and I, and many others will continue to think you're an entitled dick who needs to play on easy mode because you can't handle competition.
---
I'm not gonna tell you how to play, I'm just pointing out that you're a dick lol.
---
Because once BGs come out I would rather instantly go in than sit in a queue for an hour.  Unless of course the BGs will be cross platform, but I don‚Äôt remember that being the case in vanilla.
---
Can't a healer priest grab shadow weaving anyway and maintain it?
---
you would think wrong
---
Why is evryone so loot entitled? Just cus your speced something dosent mean you cant roll on loot for other specs. As a priest I'm lvling shadow but I also roll on heal gear.
---
Heres the rule, if you need the peice, need it. Otherwise greed. End of story.
---
What's Olympus, a guild?
---
So that spam macro does work.  
---
I know a guy who uses it all the time while ganking, while living at his parents house, while not working for the past 3 years and being unemployed with not plans of finding work, while being a year from 30, while saying "yeet" unironically.
---
Trust me.  If you see the opposing faction use that spam, you should fucking pity them.
---
It's a trinket, you get it from a scholomance quest.
---
Started playing on a normal server a few days ago. So lively, and still so safe! I can even quest in Ashenvale as alliance.
---
Lead the run and do tinker before princess.
---
I want an actual grind tho. I want something where the reward is actually good and not just a fucking rep grind litterly every X-Pac that has been coming after wod
---
Also warrior chiming in. I just hit 43, with 45g in my pocket. I haven't trained skills since 40 to try to get my mount....
---
What will be the title of your upcoming album?
---
Everyday I got to work I hope to fall and break my leg to collect that sweet workman‚Äôs comp and get some time off to enjoy life and play wow lol
---
It's around 30 gold an hour. Can push it to 40 or 50 with herbing and/or mining depending on server prices
---
The truefaith vest is BiS for healing priests all up to naxx so it's extremely good. Problem is it's BoP so you can't make money off it.
---
Female dwarfs dont exist.
---
I switched to drain tanking spec around level 40. Usually people use the succubus for drain tanking, but I prefer the Felhunter‚Äôs toolkit so I use him instead.
---
i always tell to go get a group. he still whispers me the next day. im going to go ahead and assume these people have some sort of reason to have a hard time understanding stuff
---
Not all druid tanks do this, but it's becoming a high enough ratio that is cause for concern.
---
I'd like for the ones who do need on everything, to realize that this, is in fact, reinforcing a stigma on bear tanks.
---
Yeah brother, addictions suck because they ruin the lives of friends and family members too. 
---
You do have to stop playing video games with him though. You don‚Äôt engage an alcoholic by buying him beer. 
---
Try getting him into a hobby. Maybe grab a cheap hubsan FPV quad copter off amazon as a gateway out of gaming... real life consequences but has gaming-like qualities. 
---
Try to take him to the beach/camping/whatever has no internet access. 
---
Engage him with stuff other than games.
---
Also, stop buying computers. Let the one he has now go until it dies. Tell your parents they need to learn to use a chrome book or iPad for email and what not. 
---
If he wants to continue gaming, he needs to get a job, even if that means his parents make him now the lawn, take the trash out, walk the dog... whatever...
---
You're super low level still, just focus on fighting one mob at a time. Generally don't buy gear - just get the quest rewards, also run Deadmines for some gear there. You get enough items from quests and dungeons. Also Paladin are the best when grouped up with someone because they're so good at support and being a sturdy pillar who can self heal and wears high armor gear. People are usually happy to group up for quests.
---
If you're in it for the adventure, you're going to have a great time. I've never rushed any of my characters to 60, and leveling is still my favorite part of the game. If anything, the struggle to reach certain milestones (Druid cat form) is the worst part.
---
Not without going too deep into the shadow tree.
---
Fuck usimg a shield on the early dungeons, unless you're making big pulls with patient players ofc.
---
Just makes it easier for dps to pull aggro and boy do they like unloading their damagw on pull.
---
Top level mental gymnastics here. Anyway, no need to argue with a misogynistic sociopath.
---
I won‚Äôt read these anymore
---
Yes milord?
---
Also worth noting that the "Frenzy" talent in the Beast Mastery tree is better with a faster pet.
---
Ive used it probably a dozen times, they are fast, generally less than a minute between asking for a ride and arriving at your destination. Faster than most warlocks i ever raided with tbh.
---
You are being vile by attacking an app that some like to use. Why the fuck do you care? Later kettle.
---
Yeah, I'd never sell them for less than 700g.  I'd take 850g now.  As the economy gets better, I'm going to start asking for more gold for it. :)
---
Ahh that stinks. Thanks
---
Tanks gonna be like "fuck you me want ring" and leave.
---
I feel like this is more of an issue on alliance as the instance is on horde territory.
---
As a rogue, you would like the gnome racial to escape from any snaring effects with a 1 minute cooldown. 
---
As a mage, we enjoy the passive intelligence buff. But we also enjoy the anti snaring racial, a bit less though due to blink. It's very good against those rogues and their crippling poisons.
---
It‚Äôs not connected to their IRL identities and no one is advocating brigading or harassment. In fact, quite the opposite. We‚Äôre advocating isolation, which is the antithesis of brigading.
---
Thank you for the information :)
---
Nice way to win it! Grats
---
Yup leveling is one half, and the guild is the other. Making pals, downing raid bosses. Just having a hell of a time. Getting best gear, kicking alliance ass and working toward the current legendary.
---
Twinks are non existent as there is no honor system or BGs so holding onto the items would b best until that stuff rolls out later
---
If you think jokingly calling twitch stupid, despite the fact that I use it, vile then you are very very sensitive. And you should work on that yourself.
---
Compared to the other healers shamans are in general the most difficult to master. 
---
With everything taken into consideration(mana issues, constant repositioning of totems etc etc), the most tedious healer.
---
If you do dungeons where everyone in your party is fairly low lvl compared to the reckomended level then cc is very usefull.
---
You barely have to train skills as warrior, lots of them barely improve your damage by a substential amount
---
Here's the thing, if you join a party with a tank role, because you want in a party as quickly as possible.
---
Stick to your role, unless you honestly went out of your way to spec differently for those who need a tank.
---
I love how, entitled you are, with your multi spec class.
---
Question is, do you make alt on new account or the same o.O
---
Yes. With about 20g to spare.
---
SM farm gives a lot of gold.
---
Ok
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion here, but the tank should be tanking far enough away from CC to prevent this from happening. I tanked for years - it‚Äôs not just about aggro and mitigation, it‚Äôs also about creating conditions for safe high DPS.
---
Its pointless
---
Haha.... Right........ That's exactly what you said! My bad!
---
Sounds shitty.
---
"Mom...more hot pockets" lol nice set up man.
---
No. Watch the video linked above. It works more like chain lightning. Which is pretty weird actually.
---
Funny video, but memes aside I think the winner of the whole thing was still Blizzard. I still feel like the whole "You think you do" meme *helped* the explosive interest towards Classic. Now that it looks like the community "won" and Brack "lost", hype is bigger than it might have been if it was Blizzard was the one announcing classic option in 2013. Re-releasing the same game without changes 10 years ago doesn't automatically grant popularity, now all the steps along the way ended up just helping Blizzard's pockets.
---
Alot of people would disagree. Sure it is better. But easier? Faster? Ha
---
I've found the AH do be really cheap or really expensive and no in between. I've seen people listing a stack of mageweave for like 15s and I've seen a ton of people list 10 copper pre for 80s which is insane
---
I should lvl holy?
---
wow.
---
You seem very angry. I'm sorry you didn't get enough love as a child.
---
TLDR
---
I typically have Audible up with the next book in my list playing.
---
Your brothers or cousin got caught doing something and Blizz thinks you're the same person.
---
Warlock. 
---
1. Easy leveling
---
2. Great Gank and gank protection
---
3. Portals make you feel needed (but after they are done you are again just a body in raid until you are hit capped lol)
---
4. Dark quest lines that are fairly immersive
---
5. Easiest raid rotation known to man due to the debuff limits
---
6. Solo boss ability on certain bosses for gold farm
---
7. Next to no down time if properly played
---
8. End game top dps contender
---
Personally am a fan of gatorbite

People are retards and do a lot of assuming, plus this is Reddit. Don't stress over anything. You're cool.

Just a bunch of bandwagoners copying others. Come up with your own edgy insult.

Battlegrounds are being introduced in phase2. This is when twink gear will reach a new ATH in price.
---
Did it wrong lol

Clearly not rich you actually earned. What‚Äôs it like having a rich daddy?
---
Seems to be my pve realm is like 70/30 Alliance/Horde and I'm Alliance. Kinda sickened. Of course I'd prefer it balanced but I'd probably prefer minority. I just want quick bg queues when the time comes.
---
I will look into it, not sure how good it is tho

again, this is why you're the asshole. read your message.

My dad is dead. Reported.

How in the fucking world do you equate everybody getting an equal 20% chance at the item as OP "ensuring they get a prize"????
---
It's a 20% roll if they wanted 100% they'd tell everyone to greed like you morons then ninja it.
---
Sounds like the mindset of someone that was never looking to do end game content or won‚Äôt try.
---
Depends
---
Hell yeah man. Soak up the beauty that is classic!  So much work went into this and to just fly over it was a disservice to the art teams.
---
By that do you mean the class that most terrible players flock to?
---
I cannot
---
I'm fearing this too. Getting 40 people to raid, losing gear rolls for weeks, waiting on drinking mages even more... It's going to be tough!
---
Woah, SpartanUi is up and running?!?
---
I wish Alliance had events like this on the server!
---
I am a human male and I think it looks pretty OG
---
No they should have just never increased the level to begin with. Either way you needed to reach 60 to do the TBC, the level gating is just an arbitrary reset to force players to buy the expansion to play with their friends that had it. If they left the cap at 60 yeah you might have better gear but you could still do level 60 stuff with your friends and mates. With level 70 they cant even ENTER the same BG as you without first buying the expansion, even if its a BG that was in vanilla like WSG or AB.
---
See the problem? Now repeat it 7 times and we are where we are today with a story-line with no coherence or meaning when you play through it.
---
There are plenty of alternative progression systems that lots of games have used, including Blizzard themselves (Paragon Levels in D3?) that blizzard could have used, but none of them would have moved units like the level cap increase does. But it also completely gutted the game more and more with every iteration, essentially making all previous content obsolete instead of not-ideal.
---
Imagine being this close-minded. Completely idiotic.
---
If your guild is looking at dps charts when giving out loot I feel bad for you
---
I agree
---
then again, how did you have 170g at 43? what am I not doing? I'm 56 and can barely hold down 30g
---
Lmao dude youre delusional if you think youre gonna solo quest as prot and only be behind arms/fury by ‚Äúa few hours.‚Äù
---
GTL, friend
---
Gambling, Tinkering, Laundering
---
It's literally an open market ... you didn't lose your house over it, just make it known and move on. There is no court of Azeroth man.
---
I mean I have a similar played, and I did none of the raid stuff. I'm sitting at 60 and need both Dal'rends and a ranged weapon to complete my prebis, including lionheart, which is the reason I dont have my epic mount.
---
Little bit of a dead end here for questing. 42 warlock, couple bars from 43. What dungeon(s) could I run from now until 44 that‚Äôs appropriate for my level (I.e. groups won‚Äôt exclude me because I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo low‚Äù).
---
No. The game start at lvl 1 and you create your own experiencie
---
I was just thinking, if I do this, would it be okay to ask dps to single target only the skull?  And if they dont and aoe too much, then the saying goes.. you spank it; you tank it..right?
---
I‚Äôve had to reroll like 3 times cause my friends suck and all I‚Äôve wanted is to get to duskwood every time. Best memories there for sure
---
I've played horde since vanilla. Do ally not have anything similar to barrens chat?
---
Need if you need
---
Ok so basically you're whole argument against "meme specs" falls apart now. You've been complaining in this thread that you want speed, efficiency etc cuz you got shit to do,but then you run the raid with only 37 people???? You don't even have a full group...
---
So obviously time and efficiency isn't your concern. You're just being picky af for no reason. This game is 15 years old. No one gives a shit about why you think you need to min max molten core lol. People fucking 5 manned Onyxia like bro it's not that deep
---
I think it's obvious that Blizzard wasn't interested in vanilla because they thought there was no profit on it. When they realised that, in fact, there was a lot of people willing to put their money on it they released it.
---
I don't get seeing this a as war. People said "we want vanilla". Blizzard thought "nah, I won't get anything from this". People said "WE REALLY, REALLY WANT VANILLA" and Blizzard though "hey, maybe I can get money from this after all". The end.
---
Uhh ravenger is the best tank item
---
Literally every hunter my friend. There is a post about this on this sub literally every day.
---
No argument there.
---
Yeah.  Currently vendoring seems to be the most profitable since with the amount of people skinning the AH prices are all over the place.  I think once you get to Heavy Leather and above you can start to consider trying to sell on AH
---
TIL everyone resurrects after 30 days. Why did we make such a big deal about Jesus then?
---
I usually grind in Hilldrad Foothills and then Arathi. Always Humans so I get cloth for bandages and as I play UD to cannibalize. Sometimes mes I take some "kill this or kill that" quests, but not times a just grind and I love it.
---
What a douche. If I was on the same server he'd go straight on my blacklist.
---
There is a lot of truth and judging on the story... priest is probably saying ‚Äúlol they were mad i wasnt shielding the tank, i will forget u all in 5 mins‚Äù
---
Spam dungeons. Sfk, then sm gy, sm library, sm armory, sm cath, rfk, rfd, etc
---
As I read this someone advertised one in chat for 8g.
---
Did you just sell those for 500g? I guess you just sold those for 500g.
---
The idea of a raid for max level characters only, where *purple* items dropped off every boss, and where it took 40 people to kill legendary monsters... that shit was truly epic for a lot of people and it showed. The leveling/dungeon grind is a completely different beast from raids, so in a sense it was kinda like ‚Äúthe game starts at 60.‚Äù Personally, I‚Äôm lvl 35 so it‚Äôll be a while for me haha
---
there is soooooo much to do at level 60.
---
a lot of classes can farm themselves craftable BiS items. not only pre raid. some of them are even BiS until late BWL. maybe you even want more than one gear. for all 3 speccs? or farm the 900 gold for the epicmount?
---
I was looking for this comment.
---
ONE OF US ONE OF US
---
Crossroads is under attack
---
Mages are entitled rn
---
Congratulations on finding that discourse you clearly set out to find today. Have a celebratory yogurt.
---
How are you watching overwatch in the bottom left corner?
---
In vanilla, guard did not attack mobs.  Only korfax would.
---
Stack sunders before revenge.
---
Ill usually go like this on f.ex 5 mobs in regular dungeons: 
---
- Mark skull and x
---
- charge, 1 hit, demo/battleshout
---
-defensive stance&gt; bloodrage
---
-stack 3 sunders on Skull, dps can go in
---
-stack 2-3 sunders on X
---
-Tab-sunder on rest of target and keep the pull close
---
-Weave in shield bash, revenge when you have the rage. If I have full control ill use thunde clap, cleave, HS, disarm
---
Extra tips:
---
-Pay attention when mage starts AOE, if there‚Äôs a target that you haven‚Äôt attacked yet prepare to taunt.
---
-Make sure melees start their dps on skull/the target you have most threat from.
---
And of course there‚Äôs soo much more.
---
I can recommend Skarm tanks stream/youtube for tips and tricks.
---
Hope this helps at least somewhat.
---
Maybe it's just my naive sense of justice, but I believe every permanent ban should be manually verified by a human being.
---
that's what i figured too... pretty lame ass addon tbh
---
Pretty sure 95% of mages are unaware of what crowd control is. SPELLCLEAVE ZOMG420.
---
Not everyone wants to set an alarm for 3am to go farm dinosaurs pixels.
---
They don‚Äôt need on everything. They don‚Äôt have a pet ninja pulling.
---
Mage is likely my fav class, although I rolled priest as my main for classic.....
---
As much as I'd like to disagree... I really can't.
---
Every time I fight a hunter in classic(PvP Server) they all seem to know what they are doing and have good pet control and range management. 
---
Every time I fight a mage.... Well, they usually do something idiotic(Like blink into physic scream range to frost nova even though i'm a priest and I can just dispel it, or the fact I'm a range class and it's pretty useless anyway.) So no, I can't really dispute it.
---
Do you seriously believe that everyone was either not playing or playing retail prior to classic? Do you even realize why Blizzard finally gave us classic? The level of imagination here is amazing. The pserver scene helped pave this way for us. If not for Nostralius and the attention it brought, as well as the talks blizzard had with the people who ran the server - this would not have happened. Remember "You think you do, but you dont" - J Allen Brack

It also fingerprints your info when you take a SS through WoW. I‚Äôll never be upset when someone takes a phone pic. Look up WoW screenshot fingerprint

- the person who is being irrationally "vile"

Roger, currently running LW too so gotta use some for leveling that up, but also need a mount soon ;p
---
‚Äú... which, of course, lead to the rumor that dwarves just pop out of the ground!‚Äù
---
I found a dark ambient/ambient black metal project named Vaelastrasz. Obviously WoW themed stuff and its really really good. I reccommend it highly.
---
Imagine thinking that shitposts on Reddit are taken seriously.
---
My god, you are one of those people who require the /s.
---
I'll usually drop in stuff 30-40 copper less than current prices or 1 or 2 silver on more expensive items
---
If you're able to make money off me by flipping the items so be it
---
The things I put up usually sell within an hour and I'm A-OK with the small loss of coin.
---
It's the same on both sides. We had a 42 running around hillsbrad selectively killing people lower than 32, and body camping them. Of course when myself and another player gave him a taste of his own medicine, he called on two 60s. Long story short, there's plenty of jerks on both sides.
---
Cuz it's cringe. This version of wow is 15 years old and has been all done before. It's really fucking cringy when people log in and start spouting off about "MIN MAX EFFICIENCY / TOP DPS / PRO GROUPS ONLY" as if this hasn't all been done before.
---
You do you, but don't expect everyone to agree with you.
---
Yes indeed
---
Wow, now this is some awesome tips and definitly thinking outside the box!!  I like it,  using a 2h ala DK style lol.   Thanks for the info my dude!!
---
I won‚Äôt post screens from WoW‚Äîyou probability already know but look up WoW screenshot fingerprint. People harping on you can eff right off.
---
Not that good for leveling but doable at 60 as long as you can be bothered to farm consumeables to keep yourself from being oom. 
---
So far, the fights in molten core are too short for mana to be a problem. Go be the chicken you've always wanted!
---
Why not just post the amount of ccs broken?
---
I found RFD great to run for leveling herbalism and alchemy. Lots of herbs in there. I probably ran it 7 times by now. It‚Äôs good exp too.
---
I don't use abilities that I haven't talented into. Low Mana efficiency when compared to Shadow spells in you're affliction, plus the money to level them up. 
---
For dungeons, if you've got 1-3 mobs, Dot and wand (to not use Mana, trash is trash afterall). For longer small mobs, use CoA but not for short fights. If more than three, consider using rain or hellfire. Bosses, Dot and sb will kick ass enough. Crunch some numbers to decide if drain life has higher dps than SB, though it probs won't.
---
They‚Äôre all bad but ClassicThreatMeter is the best probably

I mean, according to Wowhead, The majority of US server ARE more than 10% =/-, in the range of 15-20% to one side or the other. EU servers seem to be even more tilted. You're not wrong that the graphs are necessarily incomplete data, but they aren't going to be vastly wrong, it's going ot be more or less a close approximation.
---
Get a turtle and hang out where people need to farm turtles for a quest on a PVP server or flagged, shadowmeld and kill them when they attack your pet.
---
There's no such thing. Every spec is viable, its just try hards who want to feel superior making shit up.
---
DPS warriors we're considered "meme specs" back in Vanilla, yea..... Look how that turned out.
---
It does require a bit of awareness to do M+15 - but that is about it. Epics were not handed to you like candy in classic and there was a bigger community aspect in classic because it didnt let you just queue for what you wanted to do.
---
Gear list? I need to make my little dwarf and little slutty dwarf haha
---
I am a druid tank and roll on all feral gear I need. I am not touching any int gear unless no one needs it.
---
But technically, according to you, I could not roll on feral dos gear and I never had any complaints from any of the many rogues I have won or lost gear against.
---
Damn. I have never noticed that.
---
This is awesome.
---
Names and server so we can blacklist
---
Eh, hunters do need melee weapons, sure. But just like ranged weapons for melee classes, melee weapons for hunters are stat sticks. In general I'd give priority to the class who uses that weapon to attack with. 
---
But besides that, Corpsemaker is a terrible weapon for a hunter. The shaman was right to be mad at you.
---
That makes sense thanks!
---
What makes it worthless in pvp?
---
I'm not familiar with the toolset for lock but I can give some ideas. As a mage, I have counterspell to force them to skip an attack. I also use arcane missiles, as the high attack speed of this spell has a lot of spell push back and makes them take longer to cast. If you can keep hitting fast enough you can delay a cast pretty well.
---
Reposts be like
---
enable timestamps
---
A. I assume you haven‚Äôt tried to do it on PC ever because as you said, you‚Äôd have to log in. You‚Äôre in no position to judge which is faster.
---
B. I just explained you why it‚Äôs faster.
---
As a Mage who just started this process and makes money from devilsaur, you're better off just buying it
---
Intelligence is knowing Hand of Justice is the best trinket you can fill that slot with as an Alliance Hunter, wisdom is not rolling on it against melee classes.
---
Who would've thought that removing all difficulty from the game would make it uninteresting?
---
Blizzard apparently didn't.
---
Reeeeee
---
Yup this guy draws furry porn
---
Yeah... so if damage changes dps changes. If swing speed changes, damage need not change but dps can still change.
---
For the many Blizzard fan boys. Christ.
---
A ban needs a reason. Not "we reviewed your info and tehe no WoW for you lolz".
---
If someone power leveled him, that should be said. If multiple people logged in within seconds, that should be stated.
---
No reason is stupid. Period.
---
Sure OP may be bullshiting but we don't know that. What we do know, at least assuming the chat is not made up is that Blizzard just failed at communication.
---
Didn't work but thanks. I'm trying anything. I wasn't paying attention and it's a gold buying channel
---
A dead end? Are you sure about that tho?
---
Have you finished all level appropriate quests in: desolace, feralas, dustwallow, tanaris, arathi, badlands, swamp of sorrows and STV?
---
exalted with trolls tho
---
Lot faster to just pop an invite on your screen and let you say yes or no with a button.
---
Nobody needs you in their group it's simply them offering to make the quest go by faster for both of you.  That doesn't require a letter of introduction.
---
All of those tombs have that glitched out something

I had an item that gives +19 shadow damage. Will my corruption do a total 19 damage more over it's duration, or will each individual tick get +19 damage?

Man, I'm just starting classic wow for the first time and I'm really hoping these scrubs don't create a reputation for "new" players.

Fish for eels, blackmouth, and deviates. Get Black Lotus. Farm other herbs for elixirs and flasks to sell. Get Thorium Brotherhood to Friendly (for phase 2 xmute). Run Strat for cash with Argent Dawn commission on until Honored (xmute). Get Timbermaw to Friendly (xmute).
---
If you didn‚Äôt like his comment you should really just downvote it and move on
---
I don't understand why, if they deal 32-49 damage, why would the damage per swing be different at all? Seems like the only thing that should be different is the weapon speed and dps.
---
How many hours does it take to get attuned for onyxia starting from warlord's command? (horde)
---
That dude is hilarious. Since he roams so close to quest mobs and has so much higher lvl, people often aggro him. Stitches is nothing in comparison. 
---
However, the biggest obstacle there is the constant running between Raven Hill and town.
---
TAKE A FUCKING SCREENSHOT RETARD
---
And holy fuck it's $40?! No way.
---
Congrats on being lame
---
No experience but youd have to factor in pull times unless you can efficiently chain pull at a mob heavy grind spot. Give it a go and take some notes man, tell us how you found it and what you think is the better way üòä
---
No, people say hunters need on everything because hunters roll need on two-handed swords that have a chance of proc extras damage and zero stats.
---
I put it on today. It is really detailed, lol. But knowing whether to consider vendor or take the time to auction item is amazing by itself.
---
I'm almost curious enough to click this but if ends up just being common sense like using your aggro reduction/removal tools I'm going to be so annoyed for giving them a click
---
Look it was a joke. I like twitch but I also don't see the need for the desktop app. It takes two seconds to extract the addons yourself and you have more control without installing random software on your computer. 
---
With that said I don't care if anyone downloads an app. It's like downloading the desktop slack app instead of using it in browser. Same thing, but in my opinion the slack app is more computer bloat since the web version works fine.
---
I'm a computer programmer. I build apps. I build webapps. I know about performance.
---
I was being sarcastic when I said "what is the twitch app even". I'm very aware what it is and why it exists. It's the same reason the software update center exists in Ubuntu despite the fact that you can run a single command to do the same thing. Everyone has their preference. I was making a joke about my preference. You guys are the one that got personally offended and said I was stupid. 
---
That's fine with me. I don't care if you think I am mad that people use the twitch app. Have a good life.
---
Except if the party is going to wait a few seconds both a warrior and a Druid will hold comparable Aggro and actually be able to taunt.
---
You've got a great structure to your writing. Keep it up! I'd love to follow this story if you decide to post more of it.
---
I'm planning on rolling a rogue alt, I have no trouble with gear that partially fits your role.
---
Agility with increase your overall damage and assist in maintaining aggro.
---
This is concerning gear that's completely different from the role being filled.
---
I wasn't aware it was entirely because of the private server situation. I didn't think about private servers when I wrote that. Regardless it's a lame sentiment to degrade others like that, but Thanks Mr. Brack.
---
Ossirian is tough imo. BWl too..
---
No, but I also bought a Dark Whelpling pet super early for 40g because I had one through nearly my entire Vanilla through Wrath career, and it felt necessary to have another one. I got my mount at 42 though
---
I‚Äôm following a guide and from 43-44 it‚Äôs tells me to grind out mobs/dungeons until it suggest to finish STV. I‚Äôve already done other zones besides tanaris and Feralas (which I assumed was mid/upper 40s?)
---
Why do they both say 32-49 damage and have different damage per swing? That is what I don't get.

Ally have more zones so you don't stay in one orange hell for so long and don't get that bored.

orc best. axe skill + arms axe talent (5% crit) + 25% stun reseit
---
I'd say this was your fault but hopefully you learned a lesson.
---
If you help somebody with one thing and they're anything but grateful and mooch something else, you should stop right there (and I'd say gkick if you have the ability). It's probably a bratty kid - 
---
they aren't worth having around, they'll never amount to anything and will just be an annoyance in chat and a drain on the guild if you ever god forbid bring them to a raid.
---
What they really need is Less‚Äôladim
---
Yeah it's beautiful. I havent played much wow, but classic amazes me.
---
Looks up spell coefficients. It will tell you how spell power is applied to each spell.
---
Same could be said for you?.... It's almost like this is a social network where people discuss shit. 
---
I love, however, how hypocritical Reddit is as demonstrated by you. 
---
It's not ok for me to express my opinion as a comment, but you are allowed the privilege?
---
Hi, /u/DestroyerofKittens

---
Except that he instructs that you should break CC if your target is about to die in order to get early damage. This is ill-advises in classic because of the weaker tank threat.
---
So let me get this straight, a Druid, who is usually needed in groups later as Resto, groups with you and successfully tanks. Because he tanks the dungeon you are saying he should only roll on tank gear for that dungeon?! That‚Äôs ludicrous, if a class needs an item and they are going to equip, they have every right to roll need. Transparency is always helpful, but you shouldn‚Äôt be shocked when Druids roll on healing gear, regardless of what his roll is in the dungeon.
---
I played a bit during tbc. At some point, in nethersrotm, I  got a staff of archmage vargoth. You use it and it summons a hologram of the image. If you wave at him, he waves back. I loved doing this. I guess I was quite lonely..
---
Give it time and it‚Äôll be 50g.
---
Hillsbrad is fun. Especially on a PvP server.
---
Yes, that's in response to the deleted comment stating he wasn't sure if we were trolls.
---
I'd be pissed at you too. It's a strength axe. There are loads of 2h axes in the game, as well as other options, that actually have good stats for hunters. Strength is a hunters worst stat. You stole the best weapon available for that shaman at that point in the game on the off chance that you need more raptor strike damage.
---
You're the embodiment of the meme that is hunters taking everything and groups hating them for it.
---
Bats are better at that imo. Huge flapping wings, loud screams, and when ZG comes out they‚Äôll be available with a 1.0 attack speed for spell pushback just like Broken Tooth. Can‚Äôt fucking wait.
---
Westfall can get a little bit odd, but Barrens chat is a monolithic entity by virtue of getting 75%+ of a factions population to level in one area. The alliance have 3 options, so it's less dense, less chance of people memeing it up.
---
So basically the reddit shitpost meta just came full circle.
---
The idea is that most people just want to run it once, but get the most out of it! It‚Äôs really easy to forget to pick up a Quest since they are so scattered: hence the quest guide
---
Paying mats + 200g for a BiS helmet (all the way through Classic) seems like a fair deal to me.
---
yeah i saw something like that on forums, but not together like that. yesterday i left my spriest after dinging 30, maybe gonna make her a healer if i really wanna try that. 
---
I get back to what i do best, be the retad class in current game
---
I see comments like this all the time, and yet every time I'm in Gadgetzan or Booty Bay, I see 10:1 Ally:Horde on heartseeker. Our server has become an alliance refugee server. It's really bad
---
Part 2: Not enough servers.  
---
US East servers split into PvP Unofficial streamer server, unofficial streamer free server, unofficial Latin America server, unofficial Brazil server.  
---
Full servers, queues to enter queues.  More servers open continuously.  Server transfers from full realms allowed, but players (guilds) hesitant to switch.  Fear of "dead servers".  Fear of leaving guild members behind.  
---
Horde and Alliance population imbalances on PvP servers.  Shut down the census collecting apps.

I‚Äôve seen that name on smoulderweb, but might not be that realm just same name

You can stream shit like CS inside wow? Howwww?
---
Thanks for this
---
I can print screen, open paint, paste it, save, alt tab, and upload. Or just reach to my right, swipe and upload. Isn‚Äôt leveling about efficiency??
---
Uh... that's his overall damage, not the damage for that specific pull.
---
That tells us nothing.
---
I'm alliance so I usually have improved blessing of wisdom on so mana isn't an issue. I'm confused how it can be bad when you only use it when aimed/arcane shot is on CD and you're more than .5 seconds away from your next auto shot. Just getting another auto shot + bonus damage at that point
---
Even if you're horde or don't have a paladin does mana really matter in dungeons? Guaranteed the healer/caster dps will need to drink more often than you do so it's not like you're slowing down the group
---
This really turns me on mmmmm üçÜ
---
You‚Äôre delusional.  You didn‚Äôt explain how it‚Äôs faster you just give a stupid method of doing it that requires extra programs and copy paste nonsense. The steps to take a screenshot would involve print screening, opening paint, cropping, saving, going on reddit, creating a post, finding the pic and uploading it. 
---
On the reddit app you press the big button at the bottom, take a pic, title it and post it. It takes 15 seconds to do and I know this because I just tried it.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs better, but it sure as hell is easier and faster

It's pretty harmless though, the most personal info in their is your account id, which they could get from your character name anyway.

What does the 32-49 mean on each weapon?
---
Quest announcer?
---
You can do Tanaris at your level. There‚Äôs a quest hub on the far right of Tanaris. Should have about 3-4 quests that will get you to 44 or even 45. By then you can start running ZF for great xp
---
Am Hunter, would never dream of rolling on Peacemaker/Ravager/Etc over a melee class.
---
Rogue for life
---
As a lowly 21 mage, is it the same reagent for teleport and portal or are they different? I'm confused now because I feel like that's what I use and I can't make portals.
---
Any killing blow on a target that grants honor or experience triggers spirit tap.

---
This dude isn't using aimed shot? Aimed shot and multi shot are 95% of the abilities I use in a dungeon. Maybe throw a serpent sting in there every now and then and we're up to 99.9%.
---
What bugs me more than gold beggars and carry-beggars, are people who do these things to the beggars and think they're such wonderful altruists giving the guild a good reputation. No, you're advertising this is a guild to join to get free stuff and carry runs.
---
I don't help those I don't know. And unlike a lot of these beggars who don't give, I don't expect others to help me out neither.
---
oh god thats so cute
---
Hunter.
---
It's the only class whose spec  for PvE is also good in PvP. No respec fee! And PvE gear is also good enough for PvP.
---
Its the most well-rounded class for a player who wants to do everything.
---
I prefer priest but you sacrifice so much for raids that PvP sucks and I am not interested in paying respec fees on the regular. Plus, healing min-maxing is a lot more obsessive from guilds. Hunters, I am usually left alone as long as I do my kiting and tranq shot properly.
---
Hunter becomes is fun no matter what or when.
---
well the only down side i would say is interruptions when i cast wrath, which is going to take much more time.
---
Pull time shouldn't matter since there are a few gold and exp grind spots that is so packed that you don't need to walk anywhere to find mobs
---
Entirely why I refuse to party with Druid tanks any longer.
---
IF he is asking or being honest about it, by all means.
---
But the fact that a Druid tank can fill tank role quickly, then need on all pieces of gear.
---
No thank you, I'll stick with a 5-10min longer wait for a warrior tank.
---
I got ganked by the same level 60 for an hour trying to do one quest in hillsbrad. I abandoned all the quests I picked up there and hearthed out lol

Oh, sweet irony.  You're being willfully ignorant which is sad to see. I'm not interested in further arguing something that is factually wrong.

Yep, and as you group with good players, add them to your friends list to group again for other stuff.
---
Desculpe, n√£o falo espanhol.
---
TIL my hunter is rare. Yay!
---
This has nothing to do with hunters though. This is people being idiots, and idiots exist in all classes. The problem is hunters share gear needs with warriors, rogues, shamans, ferals, and ret pallys. No other class has this problem to this extent.

There is a folder in the game directory called "Font". Just go in there. Google wow interface fonts and replace it with what you like.

Thanks a lot bro!!

30-35 is the worst leveling experience ever. All 30 areas are damn well hardcore to quest in with high level mobs and gankers.

It‚Äôs people like you that stop people from getting hunter for their group. Always ask before you roll need on a melee weapon it‚Äôs just a stat stick or a wing clip applier for us, but for other classes it‚Äôs their main source of dps. Why the fuck would you ever need an axe with strength on it? You should still be using that crescent staff from WC at that level.

Damn that's impressive for a screen that size. Am jealous

I had no idea about this mechanic. That is actually insane. Ups the APM a fair bit. Hot damn.

Usually I play WoW on a computer, and it would be easier to literally not pick up my phone at all.

If you find him, be sure to tell everyone.

The other day I was questing in desolace, and just happened upon him. Said I knew where he was and four 60s from all over the map whispered me for invite. All came to me and each gave me a gold.
---
Easiest money I ever made.
---
I've been playing mage since vanilla. This makes me sad.
---
I know It's easy, but there is easier. I don't even know where my SS folder is, why would I waste my time looking for it when I can post literally the exact same photo right away

Quit your job, have no life.

well thats just my personal opinion cuz right now it honestly feels like u live to work putting those 40+ hours weekly excluding commutes and things outside that u do in workplace

Hell yea

Work is da poop! No more!

There has to be a PSA about ganking/camping and the difference between the two haha, I love steam rolling allis but I never wait around for them to Rez that is just lame and no fun for anyone, kill them and then continue my quest or look for more allis

The water between Altarac and Silverpine, top left corner of the map. Run from one end (where Dalaran is) all the way along until you reach the end, then turn around and back down again
---
Not true OP.   Everyone didn‚Äôt come from retail.    There are plenty of vanilla fan boys that played on Pservers.    These same people pressured blizzard to release classic.     Vanilla fan boys won the war and got what they wanted.    And go back to retail is definitely replacing noob/nub.

Hewwo uwu

Wish I could attend. Work work..
---
Why wouldn't they? On every tank comes 20 people wanting to DPS refusing to pick up a shield.
---
I considered easier grouping and leverage in group negotiations.
---
Are you getting into melee on purpose or just having issues keeping aggro with your pet? The second one shouldn't really happen as long as you keep training new ranks of growl
---
first look thats what I thought
---
If only it was that, then sure. But it takes longer and results in a worse quality (picture and post). Plus, it shows you have no idea how to use a computer.
---
You did ask to be hurted didn‚Äôt you?
---
What pop is your server? Usually there's like 3 at least three mages at Dabyrie's Farm at all times.
---
U have really good content on your you tube! Especially the latest videos are really profesional, you should have way more subs and attention. Keep up and looking forward to more vids.

Just win the roll?

I swear, I used that cloak until lvl 50!
---
The thing I like about Lightshot is that it allows you to crop the image you want to copy before saving/copying it to your clip board. If something doesn't require a whole screen it's nice to chop that off beforehand. It also allows to save any image you screen cap as a file or you can just keep it on your clipboard. 
---
I probably use it 3-5 times a day.
---
OwO
---
it's a weird bug with questGuru and Cl;assic quest log I've also seen.

Doesn't seem to happen with DoubleWide or Wide Quest Log. Also the Leatrix option seems to not have this bug.
---
Surely picking up your phone and taking a photo and uploading via mobile Reddit is quicker and easier ?
---
Go on. Link to me the post that I stole this screenshot of that I apparantly didn't just take this morning.
---
FFS, guys. I'm playing the game, find something that I've never noticed in my years of playing, and quickly alt-tab thinking "I bet Reddit will find this amusing" and everyone is shitting on me for it. Fine. You don't care. Why comment?
---
Holy shit this community is toxic.
---
Do you keep your phone on the other side of the house? The only way any of that is faster is if you already had the sites open on your computer.
---
Imagine commenting on a post
---
Arena yes
---
I played a mage in vanilla and continued playing that mage up till bfa. I then made a mage for classic and I just feel embaressed by the amount of awful mages running around. At least as the only mage in a group, we can do dungeons pretty chill without screams of "pull more pls, i do aoe".
---
If you're juggling 3 mobs and all of them are attacking you, AND you're manually casting shadowbolt, you're playing warlock totally wrong.
---
Dude get your and your friends to transfer while you can. I've been through this before in retail on the server Bleeding Hollow. It used to be balanced then after a mass alliance exodus it went horde favoured. It fucking sucked. Move while you can.
---
Its going for 800 on my server.
---
I already asked, but I'm looking for more opinion. How much to ask for the Skullflame Shield?  
---
Im on Gandling EU Alliance, atm I have an offer for 350g.   
---
Somebody before told to sell it for 450\\500.
---
My guild runs 5 warlocks. So far from my MC runs, I have won a couple greens and an epic (non tier) robe. I generally have terrible raid RNG and have lost out on the drops of tier 1 so far. I can‚Äôt imagine myself getting a full tier 1 set for over a year. New people will certainly come as others quit. By comparison, a hunter, druid, or a main tank, could walk into the raid and potentially walk out with almost a full set in one night.
---
Please dont;) remember that we cannot unsee what we have seen!
---
im unlucky
---
have never seen black lotus
---
and Im really salty I cant solo the many devilsaurs I see
---
While I am by no means a fan. It is kind of hard to go around this reddit and other classic wow forums. Or even YouTube highlights without being at least somewhat aware of him and his guild. Prick he may be. But he generates a huge amount of press.
---
Now I must!!
---
That's beautiful for druids.
---
Str is almost as good as agi for us.
---
I dunno, sounds like you got what you wanted...hurt.
---
I happened numerous times that I thought morladim was a normal skeleton raider and pulled him
---
You can call bullshit on whatever you want and I don't care, believe it or not I was also playing BfA before until Classic came out.
---
I have some news for you, retail world chat unlike most of the things there is still realm specific, that means you don't read the same chat as me. I know, shocking news.
---
So here's my PoV, someone who was playing BfA every day. Before Classic release the amount of Classic haters was fucking insane and trying to defend Classic was exhausting. I know world chat on my realm more than well, these guys weren't the usual trolls. Usually LFR heroes when I checked their rio. 
---
Your experience might be different, but don't call bullshit everything you disagree with.
---
I can‚Äôt figure out how to get the wasd keys to show up :(
---
Everything that's been posted so far has been trying to argue that opening 2-3 different sites or programs is quicker than taking a picture on their phone, I don't understand how people can argue that people are technologically illiterate when they don't know how to take a picture on their phone.
---
Thats why i love when tanks pull the mobs away from the sheep so everybody can aoe.
---
I never said you specifically. I'm talking about elitists in general
---
Hahahahaha he said anti-vaxxer hahahahaha I effing love science.
---
Yeah, I'm so angry, absolutely fuming.
---
This is why I refuse to join guilds that don't vet thier candidates and keep a list of bad people
---
Cleave means doing lots of AoE damage instead of single target. People run these "cleave teams" with like 3 mages as DPS and they pull a lot of mobs and then just use strong AoE to kill them all.
---
Wooooow
---
Because 7 Alliance for every 3 Horde will make it harder to get into battlegrounds. There just won't be enough Horde, but I believe cross realm bgs are going to be a thing so it's probably fine
---
Sorry to be harsh, but if you play on an RP server but you don't RP, you are detracting from THEIR/OUR immersion.
---
I have given up on getting none RPers out of the RP servers, but it still makes me sad.
---
It is beautiful. And tbh it way way way more beautiful that vanilla ever was. I don‚Äôt know what they did with the graphics but it‚Äôs not vanilla graphics at all. Love it!
---
I have been listening to music i listened to back when classic was vanilla. Found a lot of old songs that i forgot even existed. That and "Make me get my main" wow song. Love that song lol
---
I literally gave you the hotkeys to open the websites... I'm sure you have your browser open and if you don't that's like a second or two. Way faster than turning my chair around, reaching for my phone behind me and turning back again. Plus, it's a lot less work lol

Hoes madx24

Because I like it when Elemental Mastery causes a crit on both Chain Lightning and Earth Shock when cast concurrently &gt;.&gt;

---
Nope. Hunter this time. Used to play warrior and priest in vanilla. Now tell me what kind of cereal I eat.
---
Most of the high rarity plans go for high amounts of gold and can't really be farmed or they wouldn't be high value. It's likely that this blacksmith spent almost an epic mount worth of money for that plan and is no trying to turn a profit before more plans show up. 
---
You're free to wait, farm an alternative item or look for another blacksmith.
---
Honestly, I had better luck with just questing than farming. I'm not a skinner so devilsaurs were out of the question.  You are well on your way though.
---
So the old rogues then?
---
Werent hunters just known for rolling on everything?

---
Grobbulus used to have big queues for the first two weeks but lately I've never seen one, and the last time I did it had a a 2 minute queue, but it's still a high/full server. So somethings come up. And my original server Stalagg had even bigger queues and I can log in without a queue now. 
---
I'm sure server transfer had a role to play in this but not to this extent, considering 99% of the people I see discussing transfers say they'd rather not transfer to a server that will die in the near future
---
It does jus stack and save. Watch the money pile up
---
On my phone and it autocorrected whoops
---
Peacemaker is a hunter weapon. I'm fairly anal about hunters rolling on shit, and Peacemaker is 100% a hunter weapon.
---
Idk but there sure is a lot of horde lol. Seems to be a healthy amount of alliance every zone I go to though lvl 49 and I‚Äôve encountered my fair share of allis
---
There is a large difference between Naxx and MC.  Many of us are not the same people you remember seeing say MC is hard.  I was in a world 2nd nef kill and it was easy then too to clear MC with very few players.  You can feel like it's going to be the same thing, but if you think critically and played either vanilla or pserver enough to know, it's not apples to apples.
---
By the way, nobody is saying the mechanics are overwhelmingly hard, just that, as clearly stated, this OP relating LFR to Naxx is egregiously silly.
---
Yes, in the sense that I am not only rolling on tank gear but for off gear items.
---
Win+Shift+S if you're on Win10
---
Prejudiced against hybrids playing a hybrid role and collecting gear for their actual talent build?
---
I hope your "longer wait" is an hour or more.
---
lvl 42 here, have yet to meet a good hunter that can trap and not break cc in groups.
---
Because the weapon's listed speed on the weapon is: dps * swing speed = average damage (with a +- range built in).
---
The actual damage done on a white hit is: (dps + dps from attack power) * swing speed = average damage.
---
The attack power remains close to the same, so the dps from attack power is relatively close in the 2 examples, but the dps from attack power * swing speed portion of the formula makes the 3.1 swing speed and 2.3 swing speed weapons very different in their damage per swing.
---
But I‚Äôm killing mobs also and my phone is  so close ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I suppose some would say it‚Äôs both?

Eyyyyy delete this though if it ever happens cause they‚Äôll say that shit was intentional

Maybe this is the brother of the other post that hasn't left his parents basement in 15 years
---
Booberry!
---
You need melee gear for sure. But you sure as hell dont need a str stam axe. You need agility, hit AP and crit on your weapons. If you need on stuff that literally have none of those, anyone who actually needs it is right to be mad at you.
---
Because it's literally only factoring in the dps of the weapon, not any dps from attack power. If you average the 32-49, then divide by swing speed you get weapon dps. The swing speed matters in calculating damage ranges, but so does weapon dps.
---
With cross realm stuff like this, do PvP and PvE servers get mixed?
---
You've got good taste.
---
Still not here...
---
!RemindMe 3 days
---
Anyone know a good hotkey setup?
---
I‚Äôm sure there are others but necrosis is what you‚Äôre looking for. Sf procs dot timers and shard management
---
Well damn. How many turn ins are we taking about here? A few hundred stacks of runecloth?
---
Unfortunately you are not going to get a helpful answer here.  If you think you can get 500 sell for that if you don't take the 350.  The market has not firmed up enough to determine its value fully yet (If it was me I would sell and just never look at Skullflame Shields value ever again).  It's like buying a house you lock in when you can and don't check after to see what others are trying to sell theirs for.
---
Once you are LVL 10 you need to rotate between multiple zones as zones usually have a set of lower LVL (10-15) and higher level quests (15-20).
---
For alliance it would be Westfall, Dun Morough, Dark Shore, redrige.
---
For Horde: Barrens and Silverpine Forest.
---
So example. You do quests till LVL 13 in Westfall, then do the quests to 15 in Dun Morough, then return to Westfall and so on
---
Anything's better than that Druid tank haha
---
Have you been only mining small thorium?  This sounds too statistically impossible to be true otherwise
---
It just comes across as condescending. And again with this comment.
---
*nick is ignored * ;)
---
Love the setup. Hate the leather. Sitting on that will be the worst my bro. Sitting on that for hours straight means your back will get stuck because of the sweat.
---
This is Classic WoW lol there's plenty of downtime between casts to do everything you want.
---
It was not the case in vanilla, but it will be the case in classic.
---
Aimed shot, auto, multishot, auto, &lt;free slot, but usually serpent sting&gt;, auto, repeat.
---
That is the damage range it would do if you had 0 strength and no buffs as a warrior. That is the BASE damage done by the weapon before factoring in attack power.
---
Same with reddit comments. I know all about you, Justin.
---
Ah, capitalism.
---
I main hunter or mage, so I guess I never thought about it from the perspective of a primarily melee class.
---
I never trained in staves, I didn't know they were useful for hunters. Before Corpsemaker I was using some 2h sword with about 40-70 damage and a +2 for stam and agility.
---
No clue how it works
---
Man, how do you do .. do you play 9h+/day ?
---
You can also disable channel invites in the options menu.
---
This dude got ganked so bad he made a reddit post, whoever got him you are doing good work.
---
that is nuts.  never knew that.  translyania is where dracula is from
---
so many mobs to skin
---
I had an idea that they totally could. End 8.3 with us losing, the final raid shows our efforts are useless and all the pre 9 content ramp up to the end with the void lords wiping out azeorth. 
---
Reboot the world, a darker harsher azeroth, restart at 1, relearn abilities, mounts the lot, harder enemies, no flying etc. Never gonna happen, but it's one way to do wow 2.0
---
Paying to play. Paying more to not play. Trade masters.
---
Stonespine EU is his server OP commented
---
What kind of pet do you have? Do you not have the later ranks of whatever your pets main damage ability is (usually claw or bite), maybe? [If you don't, you can find the easiest mob to tame for it here](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php) 
---
You might want to get a threat meter addon so you know when to ease off the dps
---
A friend of mine did that to gently show respect to selfless people. Ask for a portal, pay way more and then take flight path back.
---
I also just wouldn't hand a random bob in IF materials worth a couple hundred g in the hope that he actually makes me my stuff. In the past I gladly waited a week for a known crafter from a prestigious guild to come online just to have him craft my gear for a fee then to risk loosing it all. 
---
Remember boys and girls, currently there are free character migrations available. What would prevent a certain someone scamming the shit out of people, then transfering of the server and change the name.
---
This is factually incorrect. You really only need 2 abilities as a hunter. The rotation is aimed shot, auto, multishot, auto, repeat. You can throw an extra ability in at the end there if you want, but you are simply wrong about multi shot. It's a HUGE part of hunter dps.
---
Rogues get alot better once they get blade flurry. W/ flurry and SND you can 1v2 and sometimes 1v3 mobs
---
This happened to me in Uldaman. I jump up on a ledge in one the hallways and my pet ran off towards the next set of mobs to find a way up to me. I jumped down and hit passive as quickly as possible but she pulled too much and we wiped. I felt so dumb that one tiny thing caused my pet to pull.
---
AND SO THE CYCLE CONTINUES
---
And all you needed was a 36+ to win
---
üëéüèº
---
A gm won't revert it no matter what.
---
It isnt the only way to get a tank man, it is a simple "yes" or "no".
---
That was quick.
---
Yea let's see if Blizzard bans you for no reason.
---
Cool?
---
Sigh.
---
I see warriors and paladins who are dpsing roll on things like the Scarlet Aegis all the time (against me, who is tanking). 
---
The system lets them do it, unfortunately.
---
First timer here.
---
I'm lvl31 and I've been leveling sword\dagger combat rogue, but the more I play the more dagger\dagger looks seductive to me.
---
My talents so far are [this](https://puu.sh/EmtC2/eeeee1ef33.png). Is it possible to switch now without respeccing? *Should* I switch? 
---
If that's any help I like sneaking up on mobs, pickpocketing and cooking all sorts of poisons. The character is on PvE server so I'm not looking into PvP.
---
Is rested xp still accumulating if i dont have a sub running ?
---
Guzu uploaded a guide to YouTube for pickpoketing in brd
---
You‚Äôre a Rogue. Why are you looting Blood of Heroes?
---
Imo, Classic is sometimes confused when give it an addon that works in retail, and it says they are out of date, but usually should work
---
How DARE you assume his nationality!! lol

Can swap some points around to fit your needs like dropping imp healing for spirit tap 3/5 if you want. There‚Äôs some options. 
---
But this gives you the essentials for healing dungeons plus PI, force of will, and searing light to help you easily solo farm as well.
---
It's called strafing
---
Brilliant!
---
Hahahahaba
---
Zandal***O***r?
---
For real, video was totally overdone and too long.
---
Hahaha sorry not Peacemaker. CORPSEmaker. The level 29 ace from RFK.
---
This is why I have a strict ‚Äúno begging‚Äù rule in my guild, and I enforce it. Never seen anyone start begging for stuff and ever wind up being someone you want to have around. Fortunately for you this one bolted early before you wasted anything good on him.
---
Good if you need a ton of mana regen. Bad, if you need anything else.
---
Which realm you play on, according to a Reddit post my realm "Mankrik" is 60% horde
---
didnt blizzard cut back the layering making the server high/full with less people actually online? thats way a lot of the medium servers are not high or full when before it was really only 5-8 high/full, and only 3 ever really had a que time.
---
Hahaha sorry not Peacemaker. CORPSEmaker. The level 29 axe from RFK.
---
Enjoy that 1k
---
WoW
---
That's not true.
---
He was an elemental shaman. Thanks for the feedback too.
---
your ignore list works
---
It was different back then. Cause most ppl wanted a taste of raids. That was what we worked towards. Attunement and getting into raids. 
---
This time around it‚Äôs more about reliving the alternative life that classic brings. 
---
I am not sure I am ever going to raid in classic. I might but it‚Äôs not a goal I have.
---
I dont suppose that page will also have a chart/rate of spell power value decay for lower levels? I know that spell power or any +damage or healing stat is reduced for people under 60 who dont get the full value.
---
dude's sarcastic bruv.
---
I bet they enjoy more. Even I have taken it slowly I still do have that idea that I have to achieve 60, start to get gear and start raiding because well I have done that so long.
---
When I played Vanilla back in days I never even got to 60 and still liked game very much. I just had tons of alts and I played them, explored places and I had no rush to 60.
---
Which AH addon would you recommend if I'm just looking for something simple yet still built well and only want to run one AH addon? I just want to see AH prices, history, and know whether stuff I pick up in the world is worth vendoring or selling.
---
I'm still low level so I don't need anything complex that takes a long time to setup, and I don't plan on selling a lot of stuff anytime soon.
---
Would Aux be a good pick? The UI looks clean and minimal. It doesn't have a ton of downloads though so I wasn't sure if auctioneer or tsm or something else would be better.

Desolace isn't exactly fun to quest in for Horde (or Alliance).  The flight point is in the corner and you almost have to walk half way across the zone (through the highest level mobs) to get in or out...the major quest hub is not beside the flight point though.  It is closeish to thunderbluff though.  Alliance have a slightly nicer placed flight point (near the low level mobs) so I'm assuming its questing route is smoother.
---
A friend a long time ago explained it this way to me:
---
He'd played MMOs since ultima. He'd grinded levels and gold through thousands of hours as the years passed. To him, his time was better spent enjoying the game than grinding for a "reward" for the prestige of having done it. He would rather pay someone for the thousand gold to get his epic mount so that he could move on to the things he enjoys about the game.
---
I can see that logic. Having played the hell out of vanilla in 05-06, the through several expansions, I don't really feel like leveling multiple characters to be able to do multiple things at 60. I can understand why someone would pay to get a character leveled to 60, so that they can enjoy the game in different ways without spending hundreds more hours getting there.
---
I'm on Kromcrush, we're almost always high, but hardly full nowadays :) This was also kinda late at night too.
---
Thanks bro :)
---
This has a real old-school animated film vibe. I like it.
---
When I started WoW Classic a month ago I made it my goal to earn my epic mount money as I leveled. My strategy was to hit 500g by around 55, and then earn about 100g per level from 55-60.
---
Last night at 6AM I finally dinged 60, and then after a few hours of rest I farmed the last 30g I needed for my epic mount. This has been the best gaming experience of my life and I‚Äôm thankful for Blizzard for giving us the chance to experience this all over again.
---
where in the menu?
---
if your pet dies and a mobs in melee you need more than a stat stick. You need a damn weapon, which is why Hunters need on weapons other classes like also. In classic theres a minimum range of 8 yards so you probably want something good in case the shit hits the fan.
---
I tried looking for this but couldn't find a good answer
---
Is there specific mobs I could/should focus on killing? Like "from 20-30 go for X mob at Y zone"?
---
This sub is turning into wow classic blogposts
---
Okay so this is kinda random but you‚Äôre not Hallowed. I am. You‚Äôre Hollowed! :D remember meeting me on the boat in Rachet (Night Elf priest)? I have screen caps, will link later. What a small world.
---
It tells us he used multi-shot the most out of any of his other abilities.
---
Yeah but the actual mechanics are more complex than that as explained in this thread so go be condescending somewhere else thanks
---
I'm still using it at 60. It's like 3rd-5th bis pre raid. And that's counting world drop stalves
---
I mean, you‚Äôd have to go 20 points into shadow to get it maxed, not to mention cast shadow spells to get it applied.
---
Seems too deep to me.
---
I will try this when I log back in. Thanks
---
Yeah it made getting my mount a breeze right at 40 because of all the value I got out of things I‚Äôd normally vendor
---
Paint if you use your print screen function to select your area off a screenshot, I had never heard of using imgur for screenshots but a poster above mentioned it and called me computer illiterate so figured I'd take his holy wisdom on all things technology.
---
There are dozens of us! Dozens!
---
You clearly lack imagination. Luckily, in this case you can make up for it just by reading the comments of people explaining how much easier it is for them to use their phones.
---
That means if there is no enemy is nearby to attack ne, i could log off instantly?
---
now that's a brilliant rationalization for cheating and breaking the TOS.
---
AOE farming ZF GY can give up to 80g pr/hr if you're good at it.
---
Each GY clear gives 10-12g minimum and you can clear the GY in 2 pulls as in 4 minutes and then you can solo a bunch of random stuff to kill time and avoid the lockout pushing you up to 80g pr/hr.
---
Extremely lazy? I would kill for this set up! 10/10 looks extremely comfy.
---
What was the skill in wod, barrage? A guild leader hunter in our normal HFC on the boss who had the armor thing you need to knock him out of and have someone pilot, she barraged, we all saw it go through the wall to the closed off next room, and moments later got wiped by 15 trash mobs who invaded our boss fight, we were all dieing of laughter when that happened.
---
Mark a skull, hit it with 1 sunder, let the dps pull it.  Move on to building threat on other targets.  Once you're comfortable with threat, if skull is still up just taunt it.  Otherwise mark a new skull.
---
better yet, just delete it now...
---
Store brand fruity pebbles!
---
I don't want to say it
---
Man. I miss wod barrage for this reason. It was always funny seeing my barrage go through a wall because it targeged some random mobs 40 yards away
---
Did you come from Pservers?     I personally heard the retail insult 10x more then noob on every Pserver I played on.
---
What would be the alternative? Would you as a tank pass on all DPS loot if someone else in a DPS specc needs it? How do you then get your questing done or kill a bunch of people/mobs?
---
I've been reading all the threads there for the past week when I found the sub. Set up tsm and scanning and all that. 
---
It's still unfathomable to me that people can make thousands of gold buying and flipping. It seems like the most profitable method is finding an item and resetting the market by buying it all up and relisting for 300% MV.
---
I guess what Im looking for is reassurance that it's no simpler than that and it just takes time to build stacks.
---
Yes, I know about normalization, I posted about it in a comment on this thread. The slower weapon does more damage per swing with white hits, but lower damage with instant attacks for his character. 
---
All the math is done, just look thru all the comments here and you can see me show my work.
---
Where should I quest al level 30? Just finished wetlands
---
My Classic knowledge Is a little Rusty, but STR on mail? Do enh shammys like that?
---
Yeah I remember getting my ass handed to me somewhere around there. Find a group or questing with friends makes life easier.
---
Hold on let's just go over this
---
 A class many flock to due to perceived ease in levelling and high dps? Check
---
Primary class used for farming? Check
---
Reputation for poor overall skills, due to it's 'easier' levelling and popularity amongst farmers? Check
---
Fair enough, but hunters can't give you free food and drink or teleport you to cities.
---
The issue seems to be that you are playing Horde. Try moving to the correct faction, should fix it.
---
I thought we were talking about tipping on top of the rune?
---
Wow gold is worth way more than karma.
---
Using mind numbing makes the fight even easier.
---
Again, you should level solo warrior to see how good it is. And to compare with your mage leveling maybe.
---
FINALLY ANOTHER DOUBLE ROLL POST THESE ARE HILARIOUS AND UNIQUE!
---
Had 94g when I hit 40. Thanks to skinning and fishing  mostly.
---
Haha I mean that'd be drastic. Way too big of a risk for blizz I think. And tbh I don't even know whats happened. I stopped playing shortly after the dazar alor raid dropped.
---
But tbh, the more I think about it, the more anything in classic wouldn't really work for retail anymore. It's a completely different game now. All anyone cares about now is io, ilvl, fastest way to get gear, mythic plus, all that. Any time blizz tries something new, or tries to slow people down to enjoy the scenery, people just get pissed. It's a lose/lose for sure. 
---
But maybe I'm just jaded because I love everything about classic rn. I hopped back on retail for a minute, went through my list of 120s, logged into my main, and immediately lost interest. End game is just mythic plus and raiding.
---
You could also use sharex, still press print screen and drag and drop it into a reddit post.
---
Level frost and remember two things: 
---
-Your food and water are free
---
- at least you're not a warrior
---
Even the mob got mad.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt care about raiding, raiding I‚Äôm gonna be healing...but pvp I‚Äôm gonna prob want to go elemental...I see a lot of people basically saying it‚Äôs a repeat of vanilla where people play shaman and then they are disappointed at 60 and re roll
---
That's how you know they're burning out. When they come to the game subreddit to bitch about irrelevant things ü§£
---
Yeah I just couldn't follow what you meant in those comments. That was what drove me to go asking and someone told me the damage on instant attacks can be different even on weapons with the same damage range, because of something called normalization. Really I just needed someone to link the normalization page to me, because now I understand the answer to OP's question. I appreciate your responses here though, thank you.
---
Corruption is a 93% coefficient I believe, so that‚Äôs essentially 18 damage added to the total damage caused by it, split evenly between the ticks.
---
I have a lvl 19 rogue currently. I am loving it so far. They do good damage.  Bandaids are your best friend. I can solo most things on my own.  Stealth isn‚Äôt like retail though. You move 50% slower and mobs can detect you if you get too close and aren‚Äôt directly behind them. Not a complaint, but something to consider.
---
Such business such good...
---
Meh at people complaining about the picture, didn't know that there were that many people with severe autism.. 
---
But then again, video games are the best escape from reality to live in a fantasy world, which is something that attracts people with autism..
---
People are in luck, the image is plenty clear
---
Would be cool if quiver and bow stayed on your back permanently.
---
You shouldn't. Good mages well always be in demand and honestly the difference between the most played class and the least played is only a few percentage.
---
Well you did make your name ViomentWeed...
---
Honestly I think it's level 10. You go from mediocre to arguably the best solo pve class in the game as soon as you get your pet. There are certainly more milestones along the way, but Hunter level 9 to 10 is probably the biggest power jump in classic.
---
World chat my dude.
---
Proof that op doesn‚Äôt ninja? The whole thing is entirely hypothetical, but if you take every thing at face value i wouldn‚Äôt consider the OP hypocritical at all
---
Hunters don't change much after level 10, at least for solo questing.
---
Send pet, Hunter's mark, shoot, kite, kill, repeat.
---
Certain talents like Aimed Shot and new dimensions, but it's not really like Druid getting cat or Priest getting Shadowform.
---
Yeah you gotta do the move where you step outside, take a deep breath, then decide that was enough to say you weren't online all day.
---
wow
---
I posted in THIS post about 15 hours ago, but I'll copy it to this comment thread:
---
TL;DR: the left weapon does more per swing on a normal attack, but not on an instant attack. Specifically: left (83 white average, 85.8 instant attack average), right (75 white average, 90.0 instant attack average)
---
More info: weapons are considered "normalized" in 1.12, which means for instant attacks, dps gained by attack power, the damage is not multiplied by the weapons swing speed, but one designated by the weapon type.
---
2h weapon normalization speed is 3.3, so instant attacks with any 2h weapon calculates (weapon dps x weapon speed + AP dps x 3.3) as the instant attack average damage. This is the average number you can calculate before any additions or multiplication for the specific attack.
---
Left weapon: Actual DPS 26.8 Weapon DPS 13.1 AP DPS 13.7 Swing speed 3.1 Weapon damage 40.6 AP damage 45.2
---
Left Total average damage 85.8
---
Right weapon: Actual DPS 32.6 Weapon DPS 17.6 AP DPS 15.0 Swing speed 2.3 Weapon damage 40.5 AP damage 49.5
---
Right Total average damage 90.0
---
the yoda flips on gnome are the best
---
I stand with you and taking phone pics. Let‚Äôs make a movement to exclusively take phone pics just to piss off the salt monsters.
---
Nice, thanks \^\^
---
Sometimes you have to tank when low lvl and pulling multi mobs just get a good wand to shoot when mobs are on you , if your single targeting them they shouldn‚Äôt be really getting in melee range use frost bolt
---
because its clickbait
---
This is my first time ever playing WoW and I picked a Gnome Frost Mage cuz I wanted to base my character of the Ice King from Adventure Time. Little did I know how much hate would come with this but it‚Äôs worth I love being a mage!
---
Ugh feral druid/rogue gear is literally the same. And is not equivalent to feral rolling on mage. Nevermimd. Youre right. Im fucking arguing with a druid tank. Fuck
---
Go Gravediggers!
---
It's easier to just run to sentinel hill and fly to Darkshire
---
Forget about your fear of missing out.  I'm slow as fuck because I enjoy taking my time, reading the quest, fishing, and mainly, mainly fucking around. I like it this way so, I'll just play this way, and when high lvl comes up then I'll do high lvl suff.
---
So, if you enjoy lvling and just doing the things, just do them. It's not like there won't be anybody left to do those raids later one. And if you really want to be on top of what's coming out, then sure you need to hurry. Personally, i'd really like to do the quest to have the scarab mount thingy. But really it wouldnt be worth the effort for me. I'd rather chill.
---
I hear she gives epic head
---
What a waste of time those rock guys were. He could have had a sub 10 run the way he pulled rotgrip first. Was there a reason? A good reason?
---
Got your tendies I see, nice.
---
What‚Äôs the song in the vid?
---
Love it but be careful. This can actually get you banned.
---
Leave Kaitlyn Jenner outta this!  Lmfao
---
Or you just print screen, click "create post" in reddit, click image &amp; video (you'll have to do this anyways) and "ctrl + v" the image there. So, basically just print screen + ctrl + v.
---
I'm not saying you can't read it, I'm saying if people have to choose, they would rather look at a crisp screenshot. Would you watch standard def tv if an HD channel is available?
---
People strongly arguing that certain specs shouldn‚Äôt be seen in raids are quite simply the best way to bring about class changes in classic, so do carry on.
---
Cant spread what you don't have.
---
More than one mob? BETTER AE THE SHIT OUT OF EVERYTHING.
---
Sheep the add or.....BETTER AE THE SHIT OUT EVERYTHING.
---
Focus on skull or...attack the x...and then AE THE SHIT OUTTA EVERYTHING WHEN I AGGRO.
---
Grob mainly has guild RP, it's VERY VERY rare to find RP out in the open world, hell 95% of people I saw on that server didn't even have RP profiles :\
---
It's def more of a PVP server than RP server sadly, and when people are RPing it's mainly just to mock it.
---
Then he's just as bad as you tbh.
---
No I never played on one that's why I forgot to mention that in my post. I just like using noob still.
---
I've seen exactly one.
---
A level 57 while I was farming tuber/nightdragon in felwood a couple days ago.
---
Coz there ain't no creature like the big kodo
---
Yeah,  that's a great summary of normalization.
---
Sounds like duskwoods for usa.
---
first song is spongebob trap remix and second one is runescape sea shanty trap remix lol
---
Yeah i was talking about street prices too. 1.5g average AH price, and 1.3g average world chat price.
---
Yeah, definitely an unpopular opinion. Sometimes you have no option but to tank right next to cc‚Äôd mobs.
---
It would seem like you actually are computer illiterate. You don't need to open paint unless you want to e.g. add text to your image.
---
&gt; Paint if you use your print screen function to select your area off a screenshot
---
Windows XP and later lets you select an area of your screen and puts that area directly into your clipboard. No paint needed. You can then paste that image into wherever you're allowed, be it imgur, paint, or **reddit**.
---
IDK they don't seem whiny enough to play alliance.
---
The Web representing in reddit! Smolderweb &gt; your servers!
---
I can only speak for myself, but I never go around telling people where I farm or routes I follow while farming.
---
There is enough competition as it is for various mats that I don't see the good in telling more people where to farm and spread resources even thinner between people.
---
Nothing personal I just feel people should put in the work to find spots and routes that work for them.
---
You know the biggest issue as a Healer I deal with isn't even hunters it's Retarded mages who jump in circles spamming AOE getting too close to the other mobs in the room turning our quick clear into a full room clear.
---
Mages have become the new Huntards because most Hunters fucking played this shit and know better.
---
Rogue question. I've started using a macro to equip a dagger in main hand after I stealth, and equip a sword main hand after I use ambush. Going with the Hemo build on icy veins. Its boosted my dps in dungeons and I dont even have hemo yet. 
---
Any thoughts in these macros?
---
How‚Äôs leveling as fire going? Fire is my favorite spec of the 3 but I went Frost because of how much better everyone said it was for leveling and for endgame pvp/pve. Does fire shine in any certain circumstances or is it always worst then frost and people just roll fire for fun?
---
I love it when rogues use evasion on me then i just spam overpower
---
Whats the piano piece starting at 3:00 called?
---
Some others have mentioned it in this threat. Doesn't seem entirely clear for instant cast spells though. Any ideas there?
---
I have it on my hunter and I'm not sure if it's BiS or not? Anyone enlighten me please.
---
Theyre most definitely still rivals, lots of goblin vs gnome lore in BFA
---
its the slowest dagger you can find which makes it so strong
---
Extra 40g more like?
---
If you are doing 5 an hour (which this run isn't, it was over 13 min so slightly slower) you're looking at 40-45g without professions and without selling the ring. 
---
Also he had to use stopwatch, does he need that every run? If so that means expenses from swiftness pots since stopwatch is like a 30m CD. 
---
So yeah, zero chance this is 80g an hour, and I'd be surprised if the loot from the trash was worth more than 5g an hour.
---
Until I bought lord alexander's battle  axe last night and lost 50g :(
---
I totally respect the secrecy, but I‚Äôm more just wondering what Hotspots more than anything. Not asking for specific locations or whatnot, just trying to get information about how to create my own routes utilizing the hotspot mechanic‚Äî if it exists haha.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd trust randoms to agree to such an arrangement - so I need on two handers, though since I usually make my own groups it isn‚Äôt often that there is a dps warrior in it. 
---
If you enter an instance with only one set of loot that is usable to you, your loss.
---
By ‚Äúsprings to life‚Äù he means explodes.
---
I frequent the sub and I know who Asmon is, but didn't know the name of his guild.
---
Holypriest with 6days played till lvl60 and pre bis here.
---
I would recomment doing cathe till 42 with 4 mages. In the bossroom you a mage can iceblock pull the boss and all mobs in the room will attack him.. with that technique you max need 1.5h per lvl. Make sure your mages know who will make the 1st, 2nd and 3th nova.
---
At 42-51 I would recomment doing zf with 4 mages too. The most efficient way is to run straight to the diggers wothout killing a mob. You can resett the mobs if you run on the fountan that is on the right wall by the diggers. Than open all diggers in 3-4 times and resett the ini with inviting a 6. Member, everyone loggs off and than the 6 member resetts the dungeon. This way you will be at the beginning and can do it effient again.
---
At 51-55 you can do brd with 3mages 1wl.. the wl will pull 3-5 times all mobs at the beginning of the dungeon with his eye. This way you can do 60k exp/h easy. Note that the pull takes like 40 seconds so you can drink while he pulls.
---
You can also do some fullruns because a lot of items are pre bis
---
55-60 lbrs with 4mages is very efficient too.
---
I would recomment doing some strath with lvl 58 too since you need a lot of pre bis from there too.
---
 Since you are new make sure to mainly heal with your "heal" or "greater heal" and only use "flash heal" if you have too. Also note that your shield allows the mages to cast blizzard while a mob attacks them. Making sure they save a low of mana.
---
It‚Äôs a good looking armor for sure:)
---
not sure if you realize how ignorant you sound
---
Getting a group for RFD for the Vanq sword (which I just thought looked cool) was about as hard.
---
The spider boss didn't even drop his chest piece for me either, the nerve of him!
---
Rng is rng.
---
Why is my server not fun man? Literally you only see me cracking jokes and adding a bit of atmosphere in the area chat.
---
it's okay to set boundaries.
---
Sike
---
There needs to be a faction queue to make it work. Like don't let one faction take up more than 60% of people online. Probably too late to implement now without pissing everyone off.
---
*\[CLEVER USE OF MECHANICS INTENSIFIES\]*
---
This is why I usually tell a tank, as a mage, that if the sheep mob is running at me it's so I can pull it away from the pack to be sheeped (sheept? Sheep'd?, IDK). That way anyone is free to use an aoe ability and they won't break the sheep.
---
Looks like [some popular horde quest reward](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4941/really-sticky-glue) has a chance to backfire...
---
Not my proudest fap
---
That is why 6
---
With gear sure single target they are a 10.
---
Without gear a 5 and aoe a 2 at best.
---
Silverpine! They‚Äôre level 10-11 usually
---
For sure. I kinda feel bad because he been blackballed out of raids down here during primetime hours for rep grinding. I came here this morning for some grinding to get closer to honored and I saw him. Something came over me when I realized I could banish his stuff.
---
Before this, I was kiting my mobs over to him and getting him to slow them with cone/blizz which pissed him off a lot and got him almost killed a ton via pulling aggro after i'd put a early rank dot up lol.
---
[          ]: cool story
---
Dead body typically sticks around until they respawn, but not always.
---
Respawn times vary depending on the area, and I've heard some say it also depends on the population of the server at the time.
---
Then I do it harder until they quit. 
---
If violence wasn‚Äôt the answer, you didn‚Äôt use enough of it. /edgy
---
Hawthorn!
---
I don't disagree with that, but a melee hunter is not good, even with a great melee weapon. You still want to Wing Clip to get distance or Feign Death to completely drop aggro.
---
One hard hitting Raptor Strike from having a weapon like Corpsemaker is not worth having all your shots do less damage because you don't have a proper stat stick.
---
It's good for humanoid mobs that start to run away and aggro more in congested areas. And it's good for riding hunters and caster classes trying to kite you.
---
Is STV really that bad..? I was thinking of going there to quest after I get off worm. Haven't been there in classic yet
---
Can we be honest with ourselves and admit the mere act of explaining what multi shot does is always going to be condescending?
---
1. Personally, yeah. The game is completely different at this point.
---
2. Healing is simpler. That said, dungeons are like harder? I'm not sure but i've had way more disastrous 5h long dungeons during vanilla/BC than anything that came after cata. So like, healing is simpler, (played a monokey pally with 1 hand on my mouse), but I still had less trouble healing after cata, cuz everything was so streamlined.
---
like 12-16 hours a day
---
This was the toughest grind I'd faced yet. I'd have to play wicked late at night to avoid having my grind halted by people questing from Dream Dust or others grinding for the Tiny Emerald Whelpling.
---
I'm working on collecting all the pets. As for the rarer ones, I know have:
---
‚úì Tiny Crimson Whelpling
---
‚úì Tiny Emerald Whelpling
---
Dark Whelpling
---
Myacinth Macaw (really not looking forward to the grinding for this one.)
---
Mark skull.
---
Charge in, thunder clap.  Switch to defensive stance.  Demo shout.  Sunder skull.
---
DPS can start attacking skull.
---
Auto attack and revenge/sunder the other 2-3 mobs to hit each at least once with a threat ability.
---
Taunt skull when DPS pulls it off you, sunder it again.  Target another skull and start working on that.
---
If DPS pulls skull off you again, you can probably ignore it and let them kill it.
---
If you try to chase DPS threat you'll lose everything else you pulled.
---
Your job is to corral the mobs until DPS can switch to it.
---
Bummer :(
---
That is many times better odds than what op did. 
---
And you get to farm out some nice loot for guildmates. I don't see what you are complaining about.
---
Hell yes it is
---
I‚Äôm working on a one man version of this lol.
---
500 gold right now versus 1000 gold 6 months-1 year from now?? Please don't think me douchy but it wasn't his lure of quick cash, but your lack of basic economics to make a guy feel bad about a cool thing. 
---
Nice moves OP. Enjoy the cold hard cash. That's like $1000 USD.
---
It's best in slot preraid for warriors, I imagine enhance can utilize it pretty decently too
---
Aye!
---
!remind me 6 hours
---
bro i wouldnt apologize just because some guys glued to reddit got their panties twisted. gratz on the pet.
---
I dunno about "the whole server", but word eventually gets around when people do enough stupid shit. Classic being what it is, it's pretty easy for someone to build a bad reputation for themselves.
---
Personally, my guild has an actively updated "shitlist" of people to avoid, listing who they are, what they did, where they did it, etc.
---
I can‚Äôt be the only one that said this in the voice
---
My thought is that the Macros are amazing. Throw in a /cast Pick Pocket to the Ambush Macro to always pick pocket Humanoids.
---
Man you really have improved upon my technique
---
You serious? People are flipping 200g+ BoEs all the time already. You know why it's 75g? Because when someone with your attitude listed it for 25g it was sniped instantly.
---
People who are trying easily have 10k+ gold worth of stuff at this point.
---
Like orcs
---
The way look at it, the more time im spent sitting in town buying runecloth for 10s cheaper a stack, the more money im losing out on my Azshara 50-70 gp/h farm. I didn't mind paying 1.3-1.4g a stack but i was aiming for 1.2g stack
---
Oh they did by making everything not max level irrelevant muhahahah evil blizzard laugh.
---
I know in vanilla I had a Pvp gear set for Ret and a raid healing set and I remember using cloth/leather for dungeon gear if I was healing I was spec‚Äôd ret all the way until raiding and then only Respec to do the raid then switched back
---
watch it in fullscreen please
---
Favorite class by far is the Shadow Priest I am leveling, I will be sticking to shadow &amp; plan on playing mostly pvp. I've played shadow for years in retail from mop &amp; on. It's alway been my favorite spec &amp; class. I know they get shit for not being all to viable in raids, but for me that wont matter as I plan playing with friends :)
---
I suggest using boars for very specific situations, like for example as a horde when I got to wailing caverns I used my boar on targets that began casting heals to stun them and stop the heal, then they begin dpsing! I used a key bind for the charge and left it off automatic so I could have him dps but called him back whenever fighting Druids of the fang so he was at the range Okinawa where he could charge in and interrupt! In raiding I use the worg from LBRS because I very rarely send it in to auto attack (fire resistance maxed out on him as well), and in PVE I‚Äôd suggest holding onto broken tooth, it‚Äôs hard to get and is great! I suggest running Bite, Dash/Charge, and Growl on  all pets leaving you with a bonus slot open for any other abilities you might want your pet to have... you seem to have researched the topic but it‚Äôs worth noting that it‚Äôs not a dps thing with attack speed usually, attack speed is only a factor for increasing or knocking back an enemies cast or reduce their channel effectively wasting their mana... if you‚Äôre Beast mastery attack speed does become a factor because when your pet crits it has a chance of increasing its attack speed, so faster attack speed means more separate chances to crit which means more overall pet dps (this is only when specced into BM down to that specific talent choice)
---
Is that not what they said what happening? Thought this was already established
---
I don‚Äôt:)
---
What? 30-35 is fine if you just do Thousand Needles, Alterac Valley, highend quests in Hillsbrad and the entry quests in Arathi Highlands.
---
I had +164 shadow dmg and decided to go Destro. Bad mistake. It is way too mana dependent for leveling. The crits are sexy, but drinking after every kill slows you down way too much.
---
Yeah, there is an assumption that the healer is saying they need mana and the group/tank is simply not letting them get ready for the next pull.
---
I LOST
---
Why? Im playing alliance, so I stay TF away from him but is he a horde quest giver or something?
---
Need rog?
---
If your pet dies you kite or run
---
Have fun raiding without half of your CC lmao
---
Reckon pally then... Is a great combo.. can easily 2 v 4
---
The jokes on them because there will be a Hunter in the group who will need on the Dal'Rends and win
---
The problem is that my mind blast really tears up those bear asses. So I get like 1/5 bear asses that are actually recognizable.
---
/reply Time is money, friend.
---
Best macro in the game.
---
I have skinning. And I believe it has gotten me 15-20 gold so far by selling all to vendor. And I am just level 30. I imagine I will have 90 gold at level 40:)
---
I tried downloading the classic version of DBM on curse twitch but when I play it says it's the modern version. Any way to find the proper version?
---
FYI, it's the preraid bis for warriors as well. Why you got downvoted by others.
---
DPS is a meaningless stat for hunters on melee weapons
---
Yeah, I used Xperl/Zperl all through retail, tried SUF for classic and love it so much more.
---
&gt;I worry about getting bored at 60 but I won't mind levelling an alt or five.
---
I can really relate to this.
---
They only work on stuns and movement impairing effects.
---
they can crit...druids moonfire even has a crit talent.
---
He had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
I've never seen the term "Hotspot" used, but I'm guessing they were referring to an area or zone that has a high concentration of a certain spawn.
---
Like from personal experience Winterspring seems to spawn more rich thorium veins than other zones so you could say Winterspring is a Hotspot for rich thorium.
---
You get the intro quest to Scarlet Monastery in the Desolace I believe. Down The Scarlet Path or something like that. Super worth for the blue quest rewards IMO.
---
Longtime mage player, respecced a couple times on my way to 40. Couldn't afford mount until 46.
---
I run ClassicThreatMeter, Threat Plates, and the Tiny Threat add-on for Details just to have options for who I group with lol.
---
Crap happens, if they pull skull no biggie just throw a taunt when you can and it should die soon anyway.
---
If they're pulling aoe threat on unmarked targets, that's most likely a them problem.
---
So you ran ret until you were raiding and specced to holy and then respecced back to ret when you were done raiding?
---
Squeesyrogue, you're totally right in this thread. But I still think that this comment of mine that you are replying to above, was unjustly  downvoted.
---
As I said elsewhere in this thread:
---
&gt; The dps is a product of swing speed and weapon damage. If you change  weapon damage or swing speed, dps changes. But if you just change dps,  either weapon damage OR swing speed could change to reflect that dps  difference. As such, swing speed and weapon damage are fundamentally  independent of each other but both involved in calculating the dps.
---
Dps = damage per second = damage / second or (weapon damage) / (attack speed). That is why I was saying that weapon speed shouldn't affect damage, just DPS. Hope that makes sense. You're completely correct about normalization elsewhere in this thread, and it now makes sense to me, but it annoyed me how people think that swing speed impacts weapon damage in any way. They are both used to produce a dps number, but if the game designers wanted to change swing speed, that would change the dps but it need not effect the weapon damage UNLESS they wanted to hold the dps constant.
---
Hope it makes sense where I'm coming from, thanks for your contributions to the thread!
---
Ah I see, thanks for the info!
---
Went to farm pirates thinking a break from the stv war zone would be nice....
---
I think the fundamental problem here is supply and demand. You have different amounts of people leveling up, investing in the characters, and wanting to go on and raid. There‚Äôs some portion of the player base that sees themselves as arms warriors, balance druids, ret paladins, shadow priests, survival hunters, arcane mages, etc because they read through the talent trees, leveled like that, and then made that a part of their player identity.
---
Then, you hit MC or BWL or w/e and the demand for those **players** is wildly different than the supply for those players. Ret paladins find that there‚Äôs next to no demand. Fury warriors, frost mages, and holy priests find huge demand. Fire mages are told to change their identity to frost or no one will want them. Balance druids are laughed at.
---
That leaves a pool of players that are highly in demand, who go on to succeed, and a pool of players who have to either play a role they don‚Äôt want to do, or re-invest in a whole new character that‚Äôs better at that role.
---
There‚Äôs no warning when a new player decides ‚ÄúI think the idea of having a druid who casts offensive spells from range is really sweet‚Äù. They just level up and are in for a rude awakening. I think that‚Äôs definitely a problem.
---
Is a bear's mind in its ass?!
---
I feel the same. It's really hard trying to recruit people for guilds atm. A lot of people I've spoken to want to join a big guild. My guild only has 25 members. Or people don't like how I'm the highest level at 37. 
---
I know right now I'm trying to go ahead and recruit a raid leader, so they can also help me recruit for the guild and start rounding up people to fill out the raiding roster. Everyone in the guild currently isn't interested in that or even to help recruit. 
---
I have to say, this my sound mean but don't do stuff like this for guildies. Atleast not until you know them a lot better. I don't even have officers yet because I don't 100% trust anyone in the guild that much to make someone an officer. 
---
If he doesn't give you the cloth back, put a GM ticket in. The dude basically scammed you out of it and left the guild ASAP. He knew what he was doing. 
---
I know it sucks but don't trust anyone, not until you know them better.
---
Exactly, I hit 40 last night and have only done the easy low level quests at the top of STV. Alterac, Hillsbrad, Arathi(hardly), and then running cath over and over.
---
I tamed him when on my way to ratchet at 4am last weekend. I just all of sudden feel like looking around his spawn location and saw him.
---
It's not going to make a huge difference if you can't copy someone else's build.  Make it yourself and stop stressing over the 2 talent points someone else might do different.
---
I never understood Tauren Hunters. I can understand a human, an elf, an orc, ANYTHING taming a powerful beast to do his binding but...A  Tauren ? When you are a 2M50 high, half a ton heavy murder machine by yourself, why do you need a wolf or a jaguar to fight ?
---
The three whelplings in the game are the Tiny Crimson Whelpling, the Emerald Whelpling, and the Dark Whelpling! 
---
Each has roughly the same drop rate of 0.05%, *but* the Emerald Whelpling only drops from one mob that has a rarer spawn than the other mods around it, making for a more challenging grind.
---
Just because we shouldn't doesnt mean we dont!
---
Wow....
---
Do RPers even want to RP literally all the time? I'm not really an RPer, I just enjoy the atmosphere, but I always respond in RP to those doing it.

You took a bath with a decaying body? Necrophilia much!

I‚Äôve been playing while working on a 5x5 window just grind, doing drop quests, or doing all the dumb run around stuff for professions I don‚Äôt want to do during my actual play time. It‚Äôs been nice.

Work efficiency has gone down a ton
---
Furries are disgusting.

You don‚Äôt want to do that till you get hit gear, just keep at it with a 2h
---
I did my "Huntard" time on a private server, and I came into Classic prepared. 
---
My feign death and stop attack pet are on macros, so I can drop traps in combat.
---
I took up engineering for the stun bombs when I'm being deadzone'd. 
---
I specifically went Beast Mastery for kiting in WPVP. 
---
I even rolled night elf purely for Shadowmeld and invisible cats for the perfect ambush. 
---
I came prepared.
---
The only real trouble I have is with warriors. They'll stand about 50 yards away, just outside of my weapon range. Then I send in my pet and they move in, then I move back, then they try to hammer my pet to death until I get close enough they can Charge me.
---
But I know what they're doing so then I call my pet back, then they move back, and it all looks like [a twisted Warcraft-version of the scene from airbud](https://youtu.be/86Xl378_ltg?t=5540) with my pet running back and forth between me and the warrior. 
---
Hunter vs Warrior is really the ultimate showdown because a single well-timed Charge or Concussive Shot is going to decide the whole fight.
---
if any picture of someone with a animal make you immediatly think about a sexual intercourse between both of them, i think there is a problem with you...

it probably is a world drop, but reading comments on wowhead it seems this drops a lot in dire maul, like a lot a lot.  Dire maul is not out yet. so id assume its not in game yet, but i could be wrong, just tryin to lend the little info i found.
---
Did crusader work?
---
Getting enjoyment out of inflicting pain on others is not healthy behavior. That's why people are criticizing the OP.
---
But hey, I must be a total pussy who fears PvP, right? It makes total sense why I just rolled an Alliance toon on Skeram.
---
Lol no way
---
My server still pretty healthy to me. The fact I can still get groups for quests and dungeond at any hour of the day/night.
---
Only reason I hate hunters, is that in all of my years playing WoW the ONLY class to ninja loot anything from me is hunters. I try to stay as far away from groups with hunters in them.
---
Two unrelated questions:
---
1) does Slice and dice stack with blade flurry? Like do I get 40% attack speed, or am I wasting my time trying to keep snd active while blade flurry is up?
---
2) what are the rules regarding using an account on two computers? By that, I mean, I have a powerhouse desktop I use at home, and a MacBook I use for work. But sometimes my work consists of sitting in a shop where I won't see a customer for 30 minutes+. I don't wanna risk blizz thinking I'm account sharing if I'm logging out from home, and logging back in at work an hour later. Also, what about steam link? It'd be nice to just level fishing or something while I'm sitting bored at my shop.
---
Or run Scholo for free.
---
All he quests are kinda designed so you can do them as a circuit as long as you start them all at the same time.
---
Imagine being so poor that you can't spend 50g on pre-bis

Oh there‚Äôs only 3? Damn! Thought there was more and was super ready! What locations can you grind for the two I don‚Äôt have? I‚Äôm assuming plague of sorrows for the lovely emerald whelpling
---
Well yeah that too.

I‚Äôve gone to SM probably 5 times, still takes me upwards of 45 mins to find a shitty spellcleave group who gets wiped at the the Interrogator room
---
The purpose of layering is making it so the server isn't dead when 80% of the players on a server leave. If 80% of the people STAY playing, they would have been better off just making more servers.
---
Now their plan was to reduce all realms to 1 layer before P2 starts (end layering) but if no people are leaving that means people who are now spread out over 3-4 layers will just play on one layer.
---
Blizzard banked on a lot of people potentially leaving very early and I can see why they did that but it will bite them in the ass when nobody leaves.

---
And sometimes the tank is just lazy.
---
Honestly mate I'm level 45 and I've seen more druids and paladins needing on literally everything than I have Hunters. 
---
The paladin who's healing wants to need on Corpsemaker over the Warrior DPS. 
---
The druid who's tanking is trying to need on Emberstone Staff over the Priest healer. 
---
It's just all over the place.
---
I tried it for a while but the sad truth is that most mages at SM/ZF level (that I ran into at least) don't know how to kite well enough. Spellcleave is only 30% faster if everyone plays correctly. Even a small downtime due to deaths or a wipe can make it worse than normal groups.
---
melee cleave on the other hand has much more room for error. Average warriors can do it just fine.
---

Really reaching for some validation here.

Yup, Swamp of Sorrows for the Dreamers. There is a little swamp area in a divet between a few mountains on the Western side of the map.

Crimson Whelplings can be found in the Wetlands in a big open area to the East of the map!

If quality doesn‚Äôt matter when you get the idea then why do people pay thousands and thousands of dollars to watch sports games in more detail?

If you want to intentionally create poor quality content then fine, you have that right, but it reflects poorly on you as a person.
---
Sure, but you still need to take that circuit several times, which is highly annoying.
---
Hey you cant forget vampiric embrace. Even spriests end up being better healers than they are dps lmao.

Sounds like the hunter is lazy for not paying attention and just spamming all their abilities to me.

It‚Äôs nice and cool where I live just open a window and it‚Äôs all good

i hate tapping warlocks when im healing lol

Auctioneer is really good, but has TONS of info. Not necessarily bad, just needs some getting used to. Comes with vendor selling prices which is super helpful, and BeanCounter which you may ignore but automatically keeps history of all AH transactions!
---
Why would I need validation, I had my epic mount 2ish weeks into the expansion. 50g for pre-bis is literally nothing.
---
Thank you! Was saving those hunts for my next toon, since I‚Äôll gain xp at the least.
---
It actually is, do some research
---
Grats! Are you leveling while grinding? Thats how I kept myself sane for the grinds. I just bought the dark whelp for 20g. My recommendation for the macaw is keep an alt near an ah and check is for it regularly. Usually they are listed 400g+ but the other day i saw one with a bid for 100g and pess than 30 minutes left. Logged into my main and headed to orgimar only to male it too late and miss it. Then two days ago I checked randomly at like 2pm est and there was a hyacanth macaw listed for 18g and I'm still not back from my trip over the moon. Good thing my alt had enough gold or i'd be on my deathbed uears from now like "yeah l, I lived a good life but I'm still not over missing that 18g macaw."
---
I did the grind for crimson 3 lvls, emerald 6 levels and the ooze 1.5 levels, got a white kitten for 3g a siamese for 5g and the pther parrot thats a dungeon drop i got for like 2g. then obviously the macaw for 18g. I tried to grind a macaw back in retailr like u years ago and it was what made me drop the gamr after a month of farming every day and at least 30k kills.
---
I was able to quit smoking by constantly reminding myself every time I got a craving that rich fatcats were deliberately making smoking seem cool so dumbasses like me would pay them to kill us.

Wait what. There's a enchant that gives extra bag space? Good to know. But I might replace enchanting with skinning or herb. Because at this point is kinda pointless to have it.
---
Isnt the patern available with exalted with Timbermaw ?
---
That's confirmation bias. You see it more because you are looking for it. Unless there is an actual picture quality issue obscuring the image I never notice until I see the nerd bullying.
---
Except you stole the weapon from someone who HAS to melee who cannot utilize ranged...  That's what gives hunters a bad name.  Your melee weapon is not fucking important don't take it from a class that IT'S THEIR ONLY WAY TO FIGHT.   You take melee upgrades ONLY if no melee in the group needs it.
---
Doesn't matter how you "want to play" it's about not being a dingus to your fellow player.
---
Okay. Show me the links. Really, I'd like to see the daily posting of human faces being used as tent canvas that gets linked in this reddit daily because I look at this sub daily and it's the first time seeing it.
---
well thats good cuz u can't do shit in the mornings anyway
---
i login 10 am  and i can't find any groups until like 3-5 pm and even then hardly  the only proper time when i can "play" is 8-10 pm and maybe weekends
---
Being kind? On reddit? On a GAMING subreddit?
---
Absolutely unheard of.
---
Only if your on pvp server though ayyy
---
He‚Äôs right though? Spells cost a lot of mana with no mana regen during a boss fight, spriests dunk on most classes in 1v1 (maybe struggle vs warlock if you‚Äôre not undead I guess, and rogue if you‚Äôre not bubbled/in shadowform preemptively).
---
Enh still needs lots of Agi though because of how much they depend on procs and crits.
---
I just spit on them and ignore if they get the tag on a quest mob then decline my invite. Hopefully in the near future, I‚Äôll run across them with 3+ mobs and low hp so I can‚Äôt stand idly by and watch them die just like the dwarf that stole my mithril vein I was very clearly fighting beside last week. 
---
Ya it‚Äôs petty but idc

Got camped in that place by 3 hordes yesterday. Killed them all as soon as they separated... As usually, cocky in group, dead as single.

I don‚Äôt know how it got like this, oh god I need help

Yeah, thankfully I was getting some xp from it. I was around level 40 when I started, so all of the mobs were greens. As I got to around Level 42-43, the Adolescent Whelps that were level 34 turned grey.
---
Here  ill give  you one of  my  tricks . Easy  50g a day  if u  commit  45min?  Stacks  of  cloth  sell for more then  solo cloth  in terms of stack vs singles. But the singles  make stacks. Sell for  small profit.
---
On my server, they will just call in players from the opposite faction to kill you.
---
It‚Äôs the angle that‚Äôs pretty much the giveaway.
---
Yeah buncha pervs in this thread, it's just a cute drawing
---
I mean maybe that assumes he gets scepter from Princess, the gun from goblin and then the axe from rotgrip every run
---
Edit: either way I dunno
---
48 here and already started up 3 alts
---
Thanks man! I'd probably say the total hours was about 28-30 hours of grinding. Would stay up late from around 12am-6am every night watching some TV and grinding them out.
---
is there really nothing else?  crusader is useless to us?
---
I think the "what's in it for me attitude" is perfectly acceptable. For example I would never ask my friends to help me move without compensation. Neither would I ask my friends to run me through dungeons for free. If I get a priest to help me run Zul'Farrak but he doesn't need anything, and he asks for all the cloth. He can have the cloth. If they need the dungeon, then not so much.
---
I wonder if this fits in with all those spoilers and leaks from live.  "Death"...

Pls don‚Äôt play arms in mc
---
As destro you want to get CoA and Corruption off if possible, death coil into a fear and then charge that mighty fireball of doom. Hope for a crit to watch them die fast. if not having a vw helps a ton to keep you from getting retaliated on by their rotation after your fear wears off. Also if you are playing a GOOD warrior - fears are fairly ineffective for 20 seconds during their BR. If you see it pop up try to kite them (there is a small box of dead zone for warriors where you are far enough to not get charged but close enough to reapply agony if they try to mount to close the gap (to put them back in combat).
---
What? You completely missed the point. I rolled a pvp server to pvp. When the server is 70/30 and they cant even quest people will just leave. Its one thing to pvp its another to never let them play. That is what happens when they are outnumbered 200 to 1. There is no chance to fight back its just hundreds of one faction basically camping you because its so rare to find someone.

Oh, duh. Should have known with you being a Dwarf.

Why is that? I'm a noob to wow and have a level 28 hunter, havent seen any reason to regret rolling hunter just yet. Only thing I've seen is some negative stereotypes about hunter players but I dont really care about that
---
If they're making changes, make retail more like classic rather than make classic more like retail...
---
Very true. They just prefer strength over agi as far as I know. They‚Äôll typically get enough crit/agi through random pieces of equipment so there‚Äôs no need to focus on getting agi (mail and leather gear usually features SOME agi whether you like it or not at 60.)
---
Duskwood is best when visited as a member of the Horde
---
Arugal son, it's currently like 55h/45a, but you wont fix that by joining another server. Dont be part of the problem
---
I have the exact same issue... I enjoy it up to a point... but I also wish I could just dedicate myself to one character enough to get to 60. Oh well. Lol
---
Yeah, I wasn't saying that alliance and horde players are different or anything. Just the effect it has had on me and how I might go back to Horde in retail as well.
---
He has to wait until he's reaped maximum karma. 48 hrs is the rule.
---
what is it that he does that is so insane?... i just watched vurtne 3, yes hes great not trying to take anything away from him, but i cant point out anything i havnt seen in 9 other mage videos... the only really cool thing i saw him do i havnt seen, is when he aggroed the boar in the duel to break himself out of sheep.  Other than that its all like resetting with poly or 1vX... which you can literally see in any mage video.   Again i dont play mage so im not trying to hate, just wondering if theres anything specific hes doing that im clearly not catching, that he does different than other mages?
---
Around 20s for the reagent
---
Last night in ZF at the tricky pull at the sharp corner that everyone skips.
---
Everyone but the mage wanted to skip it, he whined that he could sheep a mob and we‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôm healing and the tank isn‚Äôt really at level but I reluctantly agree since the group was now persuaded.
---
There are three mobs grouped close, one separate and perfect to sheep. Lmao this dumbass mage sheeps one of the main group mobs, runs into melee range and ice nova/cones, which immediately breaks his own cc, then blinks into two basilisks, causing an immediate wipe- it was over so quick and 100% his fault.
---
When we were ghosts he said ‚Äúhis keybinds just switched suddenly‚Äù and got mad that we were ‚Äúflaming him‚Äù for laughing at how stupid what he did was. He then dropped group and whispered me to ‚Äúsuck his cock.‚Äù
---
So I reported him, we picked up a druid, and one shot the rest.
---
Mages are 100% the new huntard
---
This. Just because I heal on my Druid doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not leveling feral. If I‚Äôm dpsing or tanking I‚Äôll give the healer first lick at caster stuff but I‚Äôm usually healing so it doesn‚Äôt matter

Tauren have the biggest pets you absolute buffoon. That's why.
---
As someone who has been playing mage since '06 and rolled one again for classic: it makes me sad to be considered the new hunter. :(
---
This is a blatant lie. Mages are the new rogues
---
Our PvP night in Duskwood
---
Here: https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/shadow-priest-dps-pve-spec-builds-talents
---
I played shadow in vanilla and raided with a very good guild. I was like 1 of 2 shadow priests on my server at the time. Your usefulness will not be your dps but your vampiric embrace heals. Your dots will essentially be used for that and the increased shadow damage for the warlocks. 
---
And please, for the love of god, offheal when it‚Äôs needed and don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre above that since you are shadow. At the end of the day, the pure dps classes don‚Äôt have heals and yours will be useful.
---
If you‚Äôre being serious, I‚Äôm genuinely impressed there is a wow player that hasn‚Äôt seen a vurtne pvp video
---
I mean they have to address it.
---
thx! dont mind me im newb
---
I'd just call it being a tryhard. No negative associations with it, the opposite actually.
---
This is a practice that needs to be more widespread.
---
Ok, someone ninja'd the Defias armor off Van Cleef, he's a knob, move on.
---
But when you have raid leaders being dicks to PuG members (we had a thread about that a day or two ago), or people ninja'ing pre-raid gear, that shit needs to get out and it needs to be made loud and clear that as a community we don't stand for that douch baggery.
---
Deviate fish.
---
then people are gonna start using meaningless achievement to pick people for groups that you don't even need to be very skilled for. its bad for the game.
---
This is mostly my rotation with one exception - I stay in defensive stance and rarely charge since I went fury/prot. I just try to have 30-40 rage at the end of the pull so I can chain to the next group without losing rage to stance swap. 
---
If the healer needs to drink, I‚Äôll try to end at 60ish rage and use bloodthirst around 30-40 to put me back in combat and maintain some of that rage
---
Also engineering has been a beauty, on big pulls I‚Äôll use a sapper or grenade to build some extra aoe threat.
---
Yeah wow needed more light sabery swords
---
It‚Äôs a 50 times smaller of a grind.
---
I believe there is a potion that changes you to either a pirate or something else for a limited time.
---
Are you complaining about a PUG 0.o
---
It always crashes my game when it does the retries :(
---
It's limited to you, is there a note field so you can remind yourself why you blacklisted someone?
---
For me it seems to be the opposite, I switched from a priest to a mage and I'm able to take down things soooon much faster. I can't bubble but the damage makes up for it.
---
EDIT: When i logout my crit chance drops to 14% and when i re-equip gear i gain my 2% and get up to 16%. If i equip my Black Dragonscale set before equipping my Blackhands Breath spellbook doesn't recognize my set bonus 2% crit.
---
I changed at 50. I had the 1h axe from ZF from earlier and found a decent OH axe. I was still using WW axe in arms. I enjoy playing fury a bit more than 2h arms for PvE, but think I'm killing solo targets a bit slower than arms due to low hit. It is a nice change of pace though.
---
But retail has gone down paths that ruined the game and can not be reverted; be it transmogs, flying mounts (people have spent a ton of gold and time collecting them). I my opinion the things that make classic great except for the nostalgia it brings isn't bound by the graphics being the same, no dual specs or some classes/specs just can't compete in end game content.
---
This is the classic sub
---
Vurtne couldn t hang in arena. He mostly fought unprepared noobs
---
I just did a search for "face tent" which should be broad enough to show most of these alleged transgressors. I found one four days ago that met the same trolly "reeeee" people, then before that was a month ago that someone took with their phone instead of print screen. That's all.
---
*laughs in warlock*
---
Holyweaver was a very common pserver meta build. You're not gonna be the best on the healing chart but you have the utility of holy with the shadoweave buff for warlocks. Remember that really until AQ40 you only need about 20-25 fully geared / competent players to clear. The pserver meme progression guilds won't take you but you'll find a spot in a raid.
---
Correct answer
---
I can crop by moving my hand closer or farther to the screen, It's truly a futuristic cropping method
---
Yeah you're right. After all, wow did die after vanilla. What a shame, I wish they had released more content or something.
---
This is the correct answer if stacking SP is your concern. Hypnotic Blade + Aquementas is only 5 less spell damage than a witchblade with the same amount of intellect.
---
Be sure to kill him every now and then so he knows his place. &lt;3
---
I feel like I have to charge some times just to get to the mobs before DPS lmao.
---
It's a race to hit the mobs in most of my parties.
---
Engineering would be a god send for warrior tanking though, for sure.
---
Don't worry buddy, everyone will notice your good acts and don't only look at your class.
---
So... mage?
---
MoM?
---
*Fortunate Son Intensifies*
---
That's a great idea! I'm leveling a warrior and a warlock for when the frost bolt rotation gets stale haha.
---
not til you get 6% hit. 
---
then just try to put down a 2H that never misses.
---
My muscle memory has Q and E for strafe. The worst thing I could have done is bind them to something like Tab and Numpad +. :D
---
I don't get people who look for tips, when they are clearly skilling up. It's already beneficial for both without fees!
---
God damn that‚Äôs a lucky ass bitch !
---
Same deal on Bigglesworth. Joined a group to tank the other day and the dps warrior who was in the group left and /w harassed the party lead the whole run for "wasting his time" and such by inviting another warrior. And tbh as a tank I have indeed lied to dps warriors about the group filling up and suddenly found them a spot when they say they don't need gear.
---
Yes, but if you have spammers on the list, once the account is deleted your list is cleared.
---
No one is IC 24/7
---
demonslaying looks orangier than fiery.

That's hilarious.

Or a healing pally. Fuckin vanilla gear. Healadins in that blue dress everywhere

Jeez dude, I didn't downvote, and I asked politely.
---
No. No one is always IC.
---
It‚Äôs BiS even over the pain weaver band from last boss of UBRS (which is second best ring)
---
Not nearly as bad as warriors and mages this go round
---
Could someone explain this pls?
---
I was speaking of the lack of interest in it not specifically to you.
---
1g for 6 stacks isn't terrible. I normally tip 10s a stack if I'm not doing a dungeon with the mage, and think that's about fair. 16s silver a stack isn't too bad and i wouldn't feel like I'm getting screwed over. 3g on the other hand, fuck that mage.

Thank you for the it‚Äôs always sunny reference
---
I see quite a few on some Diablo subs.  Maybe it's a thing with people who play Blizzard games.
---
If you plan on doing like any sort of cleave group you will need INT gear and Prot tanking is actually super fun. I switched the whole way from 40 till like 54 because I started getting some of my Bis for healing. If you plan on questing alone go Ret. I found success going holy and then just asking someone to quest with me, which leads to some good friendships in itself. Some people will ignore you but  who cares, paladin is a grind either way you take it!
---
My life is this meme in reverse
---
&gt; it is significantly harder
---
I'd say it's just different. In classic I don't feel like there's ever really a challenge to stay alive as long as I put on my shield and the healer is awake; the challenge is keeping aggro on more than 1 mob at a time. In retail aggro is basically taken care of automatically but even on trash you will sometimes be pounding cooldowns to stay alive and a lot of bosses have abilities that must be blocked/otherwise cooldowned to avoid a 1 shot.
---
Seemed like an accidental pull while he was trying to sneak by the mobs and it just went down hill. Doesn‚Äôt seem intentional to me
---
Christ you're pathetic
---
Just depends. I'm an herbalist, so I can get the mats myself. It's easy to get cooking to 60. 
---
If you're not an herbalist, take a look at the tea price vs swifthistle price and figure out which would be cheaper
---
Well FD has been broken and we can‚Äôt throw traps like retail, so it‚Äôs fairly janky.
---
Healadin
---
I thought they couldn't charge in combat
---
It happened in a Gnomer pug run today. The healer priest was annoyed that the druid tank wasn't picking up adds and wanting to be rezzed instead of corpse running like everyone else. TBH he was a pretty shitty tank. They got into it right before the last boss, feelings were hurt. Anyway, we start the fight and get the boss to 3 % and just about to down him when the tank kicks the priest so she couldn't loot or even complete her quest. It was a pretty shitty thing to do to say the least. We were all shocked. I told the tank that it was uncool and he was going on my ignore list. I doubt he cared too much. I told the priest I would tank Gnomer for her next time if she needed one.
---
Holy shiiiit
---
IF you switch do you start engineering from 0? I;m at 225 and i was gonna pick goblin to get it to max but if you think gnome should be done ill do that instead
---
I didn't do the ones you are mentioning, but in low-mid lvl I found almost all groups in the trade/general chat of IF or SW.
---
Idk if this is viable but I‚Äôve heard of people using intellect gear and dealing damage with Paladin spells that benefit from bonus spell damage and int
---
I mean speaking for myself personally i‚Äôve been focused on getting to 60 since I‚Äôm in a raid guild. I want to rp more though once I‚Äôm out of the leveling duty, only been able to participate in random rp i‚Äôve come across which has been pretty nice.
---
I‚Äôm on Horde though so maybe it‚Äôs different on alliance.
---
And BIS in MC. And BIS in BWL. Gets replaced in AQ40 by something slightly better.
---
Ok lets see, according to bloodmoon's spreadsheet with the 6pc having 3% proc rate, which is roughly accurate according to other data in the rogue discord, we have:    
---
(Data vs no armor (Horde))  
---
Shadowcraft 6pc: 515 dps (Just normal raid buffs)    
---
Shadowcraft 6pc: 772 dps (Full world n shit buffs)    
---
Pre-Bis list: 504 dps (Just normal raid buffs)  
---
Pre-Bis list: 756 dps (Full world n shit buffs)    
---
Normal raid buffs being BShout, WF, and MotW  
---
Full world being above + Leader of the pack, juju might, juju power, Rallying cry, songflower, warcheif blessing, mongoose, squid, and strength of earth.  
---
Honestly, I'm more surprised that pre-bis didn't pass shadowcraft with world buffs because the hit is much more important for crit cap.
---
&gt;Hotsforyou loves Emilia
---
The proc is actually the worst thing about it. Luckily it's a low %
---
The way the BG system worked was that servers were put into battle groups and you'd only queue with other servers in your group. If memory serves it was a mix of PVE, PVP, and RP, so in short yes.
---
lol
---
I'm finally doing the quest for Aquatic Form at lvl 40 lol, and I can't turn it in? I have the Pendant of the Sea Lion after combining the two items I retrieved, but my quest log still says 0/1 and the dialogue option isn't appearing. Can someone please help?
---
Vurtne was arguably the most well known and skilled mage in vanilla and tbc when it came to pvp. 
---
He showed how mages could control a fight 1vX, and how intelligently playing to your class strengths meant you could achieve some incredible things. Also, as far as I know, he made engineering mages the de-facto thing for pvp.
---
What I'd like to see from videos people linked is proof of other classes doing similarly impressive things that showed a high skill ceiling for their class.
---
Examples:
---
https://youtu.be/DgV-FPWuWQk
---
https://youtu.be/pmzeBMVW7jg
---
https://youtu.be/Mh_cLN66zHA
---
They make a killing if 100-300 people use them a night.
---
They're not Anti-vaxx that's offensive. 
---
The proper term is Pro-death.
---
Despite appearances, he knows he is not human.
---
They are marginally viable after AQ40 due to the AQ set having decent stat weighs for it, and things like the AQ trinkets but it's not in any way optimal.
---
It's just a fun gimmicky PvP specc that's half offence half support but not really that great at either, but not super gimped. You'll nuke people from about half HP though, and paladins have so much unspecced utility that it's hard to say any specc makes them useless for PvP.
---
They usually start off with Charge, which basically forces me to Feign Death and Frost Trap (which turns off combat) to get some distance so it gives them an opportunity to charge again. 
---
That's when it turns into a dance of death.
---
That was great! Thank you so much OP!
---
Didnt die till around that level, so maybe there are bumps. But, honestly, you shouldn't have much trouble. Practice.
---
Thank you! Added it a a few playlists
---
I just don't get into real PvP often enough to even figure out what is worth using against which classes. 
---
I know to use earthbind totem and frost shock against melee classes and well timed earth shocks against casters, but that's about it. You can't really expect every player to both know their own class and the other classes well enough to know how to counter them. For example I never would have suspected that Druids were a good counter against Mages, simply because I didn't know that shapeshifting would cancel out CC.
---
It‚Äôs just the normal idiots hating on what‚Äôs popular. Jealously is what‚Äôs it called.
---
To me that's the most fun anyways.  Maybe look at what is the meta but always adjust it to your style.  I don't even really look at meta, just start putting points in and most of your picks are pretty obvious I feel for most classes.  Little things like for a massage for example, going 2/3 imp blizzard so your choice of cold can reset the slow as the third point will make it so CoC won't reset a slow even if there is just 0.1 seconds left. On warriors the description for anger management not being what it actually does and it's better than described or improved cleave that says great % increase to cleave damage.... but it's only to the increased 18 damage cleave adds and not the total damage from your weapon making it near useless.  Look for info like that on particular talents because they might be a waste but then build how you want.
---
okay, i'm sorry i gotta be the mage to cut you down, but you got a few 68's in there and that is just not cool.
---
Thanks!
---
I've been testing the limits of how well the runecloth stacks sell. Auctionator tries to push them from my hands for 1.3g, but if I put them to 24hrs for 1.59g, there usually is one moment where they all get sold. Even 1.79g stacks have sold, but I hate risking it and finding them unsold in my mailbox so 1.59g shall remain as the go to price for a while. So I relate to seeing my 8 stacks sell when they've been in AH for 15hrs - it wasn't guaranteed :)
---
Not hard to place a trap and shoot a mob with your taunt arrow. So no its not.

---
Well, you can call the pet instantly and engage.
---
As a warlock, I love the explosion of mages and spellcleave grinding.  I just eye pull and hang back channeling firestorm while they do the hard work.
---
The purpose of layering was to stop 100,000 players being in the same starting area and lagging the absolute fuck out of everyone else's computer.
---
&gt; side note: the only real difficult bit ive seen is how mobs are more dangerous, but the raids are simple. they have very basic mechanic's that there are guides for. anyone and everyone can be a master of X raid with a few minutes of reading.
---
Only MC is truly simple.  In BWL you start seeing some creativity, and by AQ and NAXX is great.
---
Everyone knows 68 means "you blow me and I owe you one".
---
There's a massive difference in what you're saying, and what I have an issue with..
---
someone doing you a service deserves compensation.
---
Someone doing something they need to do anyways and require a group for, but asking for additional compensation is stupid.
---
Oooh that red white and blue
---
Well in the early levels the Voidwalker performs as a tank pet should and it makes playing safe enough to solo areas that need a party for most classes. It is also a huge help to be around for people playing a class that can't deal with more than one mob.
---
I'm still kinda skeptical about the current state of the VW being Vanilla accurate because there are way too many Warlocks with Voidwalkers in Vanilla footage for it to be so bad.
---
Ugh. Sexy.
---
Thanks! I was very confused haha.
---
Yeah which is why totems that pulse over an entire group without the need for a GCD between casts on all 5.  One totem then you can go back to healing, or whatever.
---
Ah yes, Barrens Jungle Juice
---
You showed them, huh?!
---
You are the king of neckbeards, don't worry
---
okay but im like a icy hot condom
---
if your cat is stealthed how do they know that you are recalling it? and if its after the opener how can you not keep max range? charge is a 8-25 yd range... auto shot is a 40 yd range, even if you are not specced into extra range.  I have no issue with warriors at all unless they get that insane couple crits in the 2 hits they get on me.
---
obviously crap happens and if there is resists etc it can go either way, but in a duel setting where all is fair usually a warrior shouldnt cause any issues save he gets some lucky crits/resists etc
---
No. Just no please no. God no. Noooooooooooooo
---
Petopia.org will have all the answers you need. For most pets there isn't a difference between the rares and the regular pets, but there are some exceptions. 
---
By and large, it's mainly a cosmetic difference within families.
---
Of course!
---
I meant pacific time zone. Arugal is oceanic.
---
Na you're likely right, it's like i farm SM cath atm for gold and if i get Mograines Might + The healing mace consistently it's 50g/hr in my gear at my current speed but you rarely get double weap and their trash boss drops are worth silver rather than gold, but far more common, so it winds up like 35g/hr avg.
---
Had 1 or 2 50g/hr hours though out of like 20 so far.
---
I tried retail again the other day too, tried to get some of that daily checklist done, but then I remembered why I was excited about classic
---
How do you get the level displayed before the names? Thanks!
---
Pets have different stats depending on species,while different beasts of the same species vary only in attack speed and inherent abilities.Rares are not stronger in terms of stats compared to the rest of their kind, while there are some with special gimmicks like Broken tooth's infamous attack speed.
---
In general, the Petopia classic website can be your go-to source for anything pet related.
---
God damn
---
yeah, but without them its hard to test alot of complicated macroses enchanced by macro addons :(    
---
well, ok, sorry that i mentioned quality of life thing, i forgot we are on classic, and u should be happy or keep silence..-__-
---
It wasn't intentional just funny how it went down hill. He pulled the pack to the right as-well.
---
dont you have phones?
---
Yeah what most people say it all depends on how complicated you want to make it. You can tag multiple mobs and do fancy things with traps and agro swapping with Ur pet or just grab a gorilla have it tank while you surf Reddit on your second monitor lol.
---
I don't have concrete timestamps of this, but I'm fairly sure he was one of the first to actually play this way. I strongly remember discussions of his videos by people saying "you can do that?!" back in the day.
---
Now of course, everyone knows his tricks and it doesn't seem so impressive when it's commonplace. Remember, this was back in vanilla, where most people didn't even know how to gear properly.
---
auctionator
---
I have it trained, but I basically only use it in some dungeons against certain enemies that can sleep you. I am sure it's really useful if you know the game inside out and know who to drop it against, but if you don't, it just ends up doing nothing against most enemies, so people rather drop Stoneskin or Strength of Earth, since those are at least slightly useful in every fight.
---
I have better luck /who‚Äôing the average level and whispering people individually, the worst they can say is no
---
I mean they're probably picking a gnome out of spite and for pure PvP min/maxing reasons. They hate themselves for it and need a a valve somewhere. They need to put their anger of themselves *somewhere*... It's both the most understandable and most unrespecable decision.
---
Yeah, I spent most of my leveling time on my mage giving out buffs, handing out free food/water/portals, trying to be a good person for the tank and actually feel out if they can handle full max AoE all the time. 
---
The reward has been refusal from groups for "go back to spellcleave," /spit on me when I'm trying to sell portals, and having to PvP *both* factions at quest spots because everyone and their mother is convinced I'm AoE farming despite the fact that I'm casting frostbolt at a mob repeatedly and it's "randomly" getting frozen. 
---
I just ended up rolling a Druid, Mage is fun and probably still my favorite class flavorwise, but it's just not worth carrying with you all the negative experiences that everyone else has had with the seemingly infinite number of mages out there.
---
It‚Äôs removed from launch, so Shadow Priests are useful since day one.
---
He's asking for pity.

Very good to know. Thanks for the details.

I mean, for the 10-19 PVP bracket they're pretty sick.

Only critique I have is that his Rotgrip kill relies on buggy pathing on the crocoliscs side. If the doesnt turn around at the bridge you cant apply other dots except Doom and it makes things difficult.

You say that like most people knew what was going to be the dominant faction when they created the character.

I honestly expected Horde to be outnumbered most of the time if the tales of Vanilla are to be believed.

Are you putting lfg or looking for more? Big difference here also.  Lfm you will get whispers.  Lfg if no one else is already building a group for those lesser run dungeons you just keep blasting lfg all day.

Is there any way to do it like that? I'm trying to get that same functionality while using the shift modifier, but currently if I use shift then all it does is sap. It doesn't trying pick pocketing at all. If I write the macro like this:

/castsequence reset=3 Pick Pocket, \[mod:shift\] Sap; Pick Pocket, Cheap Shot

Then I can pickpocket before sap, but then it doesn't reset when I try to do it with no shift modifier and cheap shot.

Any help?

Lmao, I'm not falling for that trap when I'm *literally* telling someone to consider that others might not know what they're talking about. How is suggesting that people clarify themselves a bit more *not* constructive? That post was upvoted btw, so clearly people agree. I'm actually trying to be somewhat amicable here, you have a strange definition of "going off".
---
It's hard not to dislike them a little bit! They have a silly number of ultra useful spells, CC, and AOE damage that makes Shadow Priests like me cry with envy. They dare charge us 1 gold for free water, and they scoff at us peasants who have to take public transportation instead of portaling around.

Goto the horde starter zone, tame a boar.

Wow this is where Blizzard got that idea from. They see all the posts of people taking photos of the game using their phone!

Good of you to post the one where the context is entirely different rather than the one that does prove that he used multishot on the fight that matters, then.

The average person most certainly has a shortcut for it, since the most commonly used OS, Windows 10, comes with it. You're right, of course, that the minority of people who use Windows 7/8 don't have one out of the box, but you don't exactly need to be a savant in order to set one up. And if you don't want to use a shortcut for it, you can simply add it to your start menu or taskbar for easy access.  
---
Also, computer literacy involves more than just being able to put one together.
---
Here's some keyboard shortcuts for your print screen key that you're probably also not aware of:  
---
Print Screen takes a screenshot of all your monitors, which you probably know.  
---
Alt + Print Screen takes a screenshot of your active window.  
---
Alt + Shift + Print Screen increases the contrast of your screenshot.  
---
(W8+) Windows key + Alt + Print Screen saves a screenshot to your default image folder.

Haha haha! I‚Äôm sure he realized the gravity of his mistake after being chased that long.
---
Because Multi Shot is supposed to be used the most in a hunter's rotation at that level, especially as it's Scarlet Monastery and he's using Arcane Shot, so he doesn't have aimed shot.
---
So yes, he should be using Multi Shot a lot.
---
You are wrong

I was able to obtain a rare tailoring pattern for The Gloves of Spell Mastery. I am advertising in trade/world that I can craft it, but I can not for the life of me figure out how to link the mats required when people ask me for it. I know in retail you can just right click the item from your profession spellbook and it will link the mats required for it along with the item. In classic it just links the item itself. So far the only work around I have found is to link the pattern from Atlas Loot, but I feel like I am just missing something. 
---
Does anyone know if it is possible to link the mats required to craft an item from the profession spellbook itself?

We can dispell poison and disease which is pretty great. Also, not as squishy and great melee dps as enhancement.

I was asking if u were talking about mages cc or sheep.
---
Mages use frost nova to shatter ..
---
And tbh if mage sheeps first and all the mobs come running to them, they can always ice block to drop aggro real quick if its a problem..
---
And the one good thing is if mage does sheep first on the pull, the mobs will generally be far enough from the sheeped mob (as they run towards the backline first)
---
Talking to him is necessary at one point in the Onyxia attunement for Horde. He gives a quest (or a couple?) and he's also where you turn in the last quest to get the amulet.
---
Real pain in the butt seeing how far he pats around Desolace, saw someone offer 25g during dead hours to anyone who found him.
---
I have 3 20s. And 2 6s
---
thats cool
---
I've never heard this in 15+ years of WoW, and googling it doesn't seem to support this. PW:S has seemingly no effect on threat gen outside of the fact that it prevents warrs and druids from genning rage from incoming attacks for it's duration.
---
whats the max level i can farm sm cath for exp?
---
Good stuff.  But I suppose my threat point remains and is the superior chance vs. anything but the fuey/prot dw setup.  But honestly if the healers are geared it trivializes the fight unless dps are asleep.
---
I never did private servers, so it has been some time.  I remember Naxx in particular very poorly which I attribute to it's multiple releases.  Besides the amount of times I did Naxx compared to MC/BWL/AQ is no comparison at all.  Fun times though.
---
Right before BC they added a bunch of quality of life changes. New talent trees I think preceded BC by a bit and quest experience was massively increased which made leveling waaaaay easier
---
Right after the same time dad comes back with those smokes.
---
Oh no, i don't care about that. i found a team in 2mins after.
---
I'm just saying, some guild would ninja and are known to pull shit like that, people need to be aware :)
---
part of the Horde quest chain to attune to Onyxia's Lair has you find Rexxar, and the fact that he paths across the entire length of Desolace and a bit into Feralas makes that tedious
---
As a Hordie I'm always excited to see Goblin quest givers, they're so snide and sassy!
---
I'm level 26, I can't believe all these people at 60 already! I figured we'd all be older now and not able to play as much. WoW feels like it is around 80% of my free time.
---
How is this relevant lmao
---
Selling ports to org 215,000g
---
Same happened to me today with SM Armory: LfM 3 dps. Get whispers from 7 shamans, 4 warris . No joking.. no other dps
---
I understand that, but at the same time, killing someone 20 lvls lower isn‚Äôt any fun for me, so I don‚Äôt do it. There‚Äôs no sport in it.
---
&gt; Talking to him is necessary at one point in the Onyxia attunement for Horde. He gives a quest (or a couple? Don't remember) and he's also where you turn in the last quest to get the amulet.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Real pain in the butt seeing how far he pats around Desolace, saw someone offer 25g during dead hours to anyone who found him.
---
Quick copy of my reply to them so you know too!
---
arent most pvp dispells magic? Like fear, stuns sheep novas etc?
---
&gt;I was almost certain I've seen someone on chat these days like "ah go to X zone and keep farming til you're 30" or something, I just didn't want to be rude with the other guy. But anyways, thanks for clearing it out!
---
I saw this from someone else but it isn't showing up on the twitch mod search...where do you find it
---
Yeah what‚Äôs up with this, very annoying.
---
Go to badlands and grind rock elementals, there are multiple spawns around the zone and I found the normal Rock Elementals next to Agmonds(sp) End to be the least camped. Make sure your bags are empty and go nuts. They drop a lot of stacking trash you can vendor and plenty of elemental earth for the AH. I made roughly 40 gold spending around four hours there over the course of a few nights. Put on a podcast and grind to wind down at the end of the day. I'm a warrior and had my mount by 42 this way.
---
How do you have that ow stream  so nicely on your screen without it being minimized as soon as you are bringing wow up
---
38kg
---
Oh, right
---
You are most likely losing the tag and moving to far away from him causing him to reset, make sure you use a rank 1 arcane shot from time to time to keep him interested.
---
Those are good to know, thank you, also you should probably learn what words mean before you use them, by your definition of illiteracy someone who can read moby dick but doesn't know what the word inconceivable means is illiterate.
---
Switch when you get thrash blade, hopefully you will have Blackstone ring by then too and get the wyrmhide shoulders from bed quest immediately. Once you can get devilsaurs get those as well asap. Boom 5% hit at lvl 55.
---
I sat under that thing too at that level! Look at us go
---
Illusion 100
---
Indeed it is, i told them "i understand if the - other warrior - who was fury, would roll on it. But a tank? it's offspec, i don't think that offspec should need on items that other people in the party actually need for their main. 
---
But even then, being kicked for "arguing"?
---
 People can't even have a proper conversation?
---
I don't have any problem with it myself lol
---
You look at it from a skewed angle. In retail, leveling is a chore because there is ZERO investment throughout the whole process. In Classic I was more engaged in my Warrior than I‚Äôve been at max level in retail since MoP. Leveling is also a valid form for content because money and power doesn‚Äôt scale as ridiculously as it does in Retail.
---
Regarding consumables, who are grinding consumables anymore? Everyone sits at 1,000,000+ gold so you can just buy a huge stock and keep it throughout the tier. Repairs are like, what? 100g after a wipe? Nothing. My last few months of Raiding was literally everyone log on for Raid, do Raid, log off. Wait for reset. Because the world is void of purpose. Yes there will be people with 10,000+ or even 100,000+ gold in Classic at some point but for the vast majority of players gold is something of extreme value.
---
thats horde protected, cant hurt someone their unless they flag themself for some reason
---
Well. It‚Äôs a a game of cat and mouse and makes leveling more fun. If one faction gets pushed out of an area for a few hours I would say pvp is working as intended.
---
There are no guild banks in Classic. You'll want to create a banker alt.
---
guild banks aren‚Äôt a thing in classic
---
More surprised that it even does!
---
It‚Äôs okay! I actually appreciate that reply because at least now I know I absolutely have to use an addon for it and can stop messing with the game settings haha
---
they can, but the spec sucks for anything else.  gimped healing and poor shadow dmg.
---
Google
---
It is quite different to join a party and one of the party members is talking shit in party chat against other members of the party.  Regardless of whether any allegations are true, I'm not going anywhere with some bickering children.
---
well,i was speaking only about myself:) never told its bad overall
---
It's all new to you, so you aren't noticing anything. I've already done all this shit, the grind, for years and years and years. What's strictly worse - running to a a dungeon - or not being able to dungeon with my friends easily. Quests for the dungeon being no-where near the dungeon. The grind in between.  Respeccing increasing in cost.  The sheer amount of time you need to put in to do anything - the plays you.
---
I'm not telling anyone else they're having fun wrong. IF you're having fun, have a great time. I havent played retail since like lvl 90, so going back to retail was just like "I want to have a quick blast, then go spend time with my family" and not need to be online all the time and fantastic.  
---
I think it's important to ask yourself - "am i actually having fun doing this?" every now and then. Some hobbies it's easy to put lots of time into because that's what you do, not because you're enjoying it
---
lol it does not take 11+ seconds to pick up and unlock a smartphone
---
It's kind of silly to behave that way though. I needed something crafted and didnt have the time or gold to train up the profession right then. A guildie said he'd do it for free with my mats, but I tipped him 2g anyways.
---
It just means next time I need something he'll be equally obliging. I wont miss the 2g but I basically bought a guaranteed tailor.
---
A nice strong 2h weapon comes in handy in pvp. Hard hitting crits with raptor and mongoose strike along with a chance to proc something can get that finishing killing blow or put enough pressure on the opponent to get them off of you.  
---
A lot of fights I‚Äôve won were because of getting off a hard crit with raptor strike when we both were very low on health and I wasn‚Äôt able to keep them off of me. I really feel like a lot of people forget about pvp. It‚Äôs not always about stats for pvp.
---
&gt; The only reason he's the main tank is cuz him and GM are buddies
---
Seems pretty normal to me.
---
man i just bought these for 80g on Skeram. lowest i had seen them so i pulled the trigger. grats to everyone else on this thread who's getting them for 5g or 20g. :(
---
Did you not read my reply? There is no addon that performs what you want
---
Great melee dps? While leveling, sure, but they have terrible dps in raids.
---
Gotta play the full servers, it's just a numbers game w.r.t. finding chatty ones. Could also be if you're EU and/or on a diverse server. I know some of my less fluent friends are hesitant to chat because they make more mistakes.
---
Why would he be gleefully reaching out towards work in the morning?
---
Did the exact same thing.
---
Well yea if you don‚Äôt want to run with them because they add more people to your competition for gear that makes sense. However, I just want to make sure people understand that is your decision and Druids are great team members and also you should expect healing classes to roll on healing gear potentially.
---
whole lotta autoattacks goin on there.  
---
might be good for trash but boss fights i wonder.
---
Classic already has 3x the playerbase than retail.
---
Source: Bellular vids and official numbers from blizzard.
---
Classic is not going to destroy retail, it already completely shit all over it. üòä
---
World chat in retail?  It might have taken off in Classic but back when I used to play retail there was no notion of world chat.  It's hardly a wonder you think it's a dead game if that's your metric.
---
Obvious priest here
---
I've seen a few videos, well actually 2 main videos on Warlock tanking using a destruction/demo build. Had anyone experimented with it (horde or alliance) or been in a group with one? If so, what are your throughts?
---
I just ignored everything that was above 1g 40s, also advertised myself buying all runecloth and to C.O.D to me, actually helped a lot. Glad I inspired you, heres a picture:

Fire is fine but more mana consuming than frost. The burst damage is great and my favorite thing in PvP is charging that pyroblast against that sheeped enemy.  
---
I just like pyroblast in general
---
classic is full with greedy opportunists
---
What do you trap/poly in raids, besides majordomo healers? The only CC that works is warlock banish &gt;.&gt;
---
female gnomes?
---
Melee weapons are much more than a stat stick for hunters. Corpsemaker is an insane weapon for hunters at that level.

Yesterday I got all five blessings from a 5-man multiboxer, was pretty cool. Ran out before I actually got to a mob though.
---
i was transmuting arcanite with other guy materials and asked him this. He told thats fine cause scam on this is bannable also. So, as i think - thats fine. Just need to inform about this ur trade guy, cause maybe hewant  to scam u but only cause he didnt know about banhammer danger.
---
I'm not sure if this is allowed as per the subreddit's rules
---
&gt; on the off chance that you need more raptor strike damage.
---
Off chance? If he's playing correctly he's meleeing 90%+ of mobs.
---
Quality
---
Gladiator chain is BIS for hunter as well. 
---
If we‚Äôre talking about deathdealer it‚Äôs less useful
---
Yea you crazy, I‚Äôm 45 have been ret the whole time with a healing set and nobody can tell until I get a vengeance Proc when using SoW to mana regeneration. Only struggle to heal when any other healer would struggle aswell ( tank is low level, mobs scatter attacking everyone etc)
---
By few percentage you mean like 200%?
---
Fair enough man.
---
War is hell
---
Im pretty sure we can't proc weapon enchants in form, that's why windfury won't work.  It enchants your weapon
---
They should tap until health and mana bars are even then eat and drink.
---
i dont think its woth it. with this you let go 10% melee damage and the high amount of threat from shield slam. to apply sweeping strikes efficiently you also have to swap to berserker stance which generates 10% less aggro than def anyway
---
Fuck if I know, I was a dumbass in TBC that's why I was asking you!
---
You do however need a good melee weapon to deal good melee damage.
---
A lot of the meme specs are very viable in dungeon content. Their problem is raids, which is what a lot of min/maxers are hyperfocused on. Prot paladin is a very good example of this.
---
Thanks! Reposted
---
It's totally viable at 60
---
Hypno + spirit of aquementos is 29 spell damage
---
That's great at level 60, where you raid MC and an offhand tome drops but it's technically a downgrade for your dps
---
which specifically are you talking about?
---
[Obviously.](https://youtu.be/ADEDLoLY3AY)
---
I will get down voted for this again, but I don't mind being unpopular for saying what I believe is right. And I am not writing this to badmouth you, but to make you understand how it seems from my point of view.
---
Sure, you might respect the rules, but don't you think it is sad that someone that wants to RP on an RP server can't assume the same mindset from the people they encounter?
---
There is literally nothing stopping none  RP'ers from playing on an other realm. And frankly, you enjoying the RP you see isn't good enough of a reason to play there. You might not want to partake yourself, but you are not an invisible observer. You are there. You know you won't partake in the RP, but for them, you do, simply by being there.
---
I am not going to tell you how to play your game, because I simply can't. But maybe you will understand why not RP'ing on an RP server hurts the very thing you say you enjoy viewing.
---
Meanwhile i helped  dwarf priest with chicken escort in hinterlands but some warlock thought he was attacking me and killed him. RIP
---
Killing 2 enemies and being at half Health is not bad for classic... any other class would be dead if they took on 2 mobs
---
Female tauren are too good for this world
---
You're right, average damage is super important though, and corpsemaker has huge damage.
---
This really sucks to hear dude. Good thing you came out well though
---
i'm leveling fire and yes, you dont have the same survival talents that frost gives you. I will probably switch to frost once BRD is an instance i have available.
---
Fully decked out shatter increases the crit chance of your spells against frozen targest by 50%. Frost nova is definitely useful against every class, including ranged
---
The two are not comparable.
---
I don't see how those two are mutually exclusive.
---
We don't jack off to furry porn we just know exactly what it looks like. We can identify it very easily. Not because we look at it. ;)
---
Whitemane is 45% Alliance
---
Imo TSM is starting to feel a bit outdated, it has that 2015ish web page design and while the features are good it's really too cluttered and not very streamlined or minimalistic.
---
I thought general spellpower and specific spellpower (frost, shadow) was different.
---
\+spellpower using the cast time/3.5 multiplier but +frost damage just being a flat addition to frostbolt.
---
Are you really assuming the shaman is MS Resto at 30? He very likely only heals because he is needed more in that role..
---
TSM is the one to use spend sometime watching videos on it. Just build your database aswell as using the desktop app helps if everyone builds the DB.
---
But when I try that, I get "ability is not ready yet" for the second move
---
You can use WeakAuras to remind you to cast find minerals any time it's absent.
---
People will troll you to death in classic. Happens all the time. I was flamed in /1 once because i asked "hey, this rogue has been corpse camping me for ages, anyone have time to help :)"
---
What followed was a shitstorm of random people telling me to fuck off, get good and stop whining. 
---
Well, i put everyone of them on ignore and moved on. If you meet dickheads on your way to 60 IGNORE THEM. Chances are you run into them at endgame and they are gonna be dicks there aswell
---
I did play on and off since TBC though.
---
You can get banned for this, so you should use at your own risk. Here is an excerpt from the EULA:
---
‚ÄúCloud Computing: Use the Platform, including a Game, in connection with any unauthorized third-party ‚Äúcloud computing‚Äù services, ‚Äúcloud gaming‚Äù services, or any software or service designed to enable the unauthorized streaming or transmission of Game content from a third-party server to any device."
---
Since you are using Steam, which is third party, you are breaking this rule. Players have already been banned for using Shadow, Shield, Steam, and other third-party services to play remotely. So basically, you cannot play any Blizzard game on a PC you are connected to remotely or else you risk a ban. This is unfortunate, but it‚Äôs not worth the risk in my opinion.
---
What if he‚Äôs fury MS for raiding and was just tanking (OS) since the group needed a tank
---
"Yeah all the best in slots are reserved but we need you for the group "
---
I swear these people are hard retarded.
---
Ah, right on. Thank you for the reply.
---
Chances are you will have less overall health than mana. You'll get your health back by eating faster than you will refill your mana by drinking. And you cut down on how much you're spending overall on food/water since you'll only be buying and using one at a time.
---
its rare but not rare, it takes me max 3 resets to find him. It's the least people can do especially when they reserve bullshit like MH and felstriker.
---
This upsets me as a guy that mained hunter on pservers. There are weapons that are just as good for raid dps hunters.
---
best area to quest in for a lvl 43 alliance rogue thats not STV? i wanna come back to stv when im like 45. but idk where to go for 43 thats good
---
I don't mind being last, but in regards to loot in MC, there's nothing really that is any good for a shadow priest.. so might as well gear as holy until BWL?
---
you mean offensive stance? As arms to tank I pop zerkers rage, charging sweepin switch to defensive stance Battle shout and demo shout and start stacking sunders.    
---
The thought of this build was when i played arms and tanked i never used mortal strike because 2x sunder did more rage. except for boss after i had 5 stacks up.
---
No, bosskills lock you to an instance id
---
No I was 45 and a person I was questing with gave me the last 10g after asking how far out I was.
---
I had to stop disenchanting greens and even then it took a while.
---
Can't draw beast races in 2019 without all the 16 year olds crying out cringe or furry
---
It‚Äôs actually just the gnomish death ray that‚Äôs really worth. But for that you just have to level to 240.
---
Neither am I, but OP is saying he is OOC 24/7.
---
Up until somewhere around 25-35 (depending on how efficiently you play, and gear) pure Ret is viable as a dungeon healer. After that, you start needing Holy talents to be a viable healer for most normal pulls.
---
If we're being honest, they'll most likely just release TBC in phases and be done with it
---
That's my prediction
---
yea they just aren't in the game yet, so may as well grab them when you can for when zg comes out
---
These are all the ones you can make.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/enchanting-bags
---
Shaman can dispel poison and disease. 
---
Tremor totem will take care of sleep, fear, and charm.
---
And grounding totem eats incoming damage spells.
---
So, we do alright, just can‚Äôt do shit about curses or magic effects.
---
Level 20 is about 10 or 12 hours play time into what's roughly 200-250 hours to hit 60 for most people.
---
At the rate you're going it will take you around a year to a year and a half.
---
They have to hide what's reserved because no one would join.
---
If I got to the dal rends I'd just need on them and tell them to suck my dick.
---
Honestly I'm just impressed that you're level 60 and still haven't figured out how to turn the profanity filter off.
---
Because the pet isn't stealthed after combat happens and the loss of movement speed really messes things up in PvP anyway because otherwise they just outrun the pet. 
---
I understand stuff you're saying but in reality, shit happens warriors somehow manage to always get on my nuts.
---
I‚Äôm in favor of some class changes but not the QoL ones. If classes were tuned like they were in TBC we‚Äôd have a much more diverse group for raids and even lvling dungeons, and I think that‚Äôd be good for the game. But the QoL changes you suggest would make the game not feel like classic anymore.
---
Yup, I don't. But I can and will say when I am displeased with something and hope people will see my point of view.
---
Warlock things. I have had so many rogues open on me while i fighting mobs and i always laugh at them while i sac vw and deathcoil Them into a fear and 4 dots on Them.
---
Cya later rogue. Nice knowing you üòÇ
---
I have been questing in STV for the past few levels on my 36 druid on a high pop server (Fairbanks), and have been pleasantly surprised to find most of the players I encounter on both sides to be right around my level. I honestly haven't seen too many gank squads. And the ones I have seen have *mostly* been groups of mid 30s players doing quests and murdering alliance that were "stealing" their mobs.
---
I mean... 
---
I really don't care if they add cosmetic changes. It doesn't affect me in any way whatsoever.
---
all i can say is i've had multiple grps fail to get a jed lockout within 3-4 resets. sometimes you get it first reset other times you get fucked
---
**I got low-levelitis, aint nobody got 15gold for that.**
---
Love Russians in eve. They are so chill most of the time.
---
There's a difference between fighting someone over mobs, and walking into the lowest zone you can to continually gank lowbies.
---
If you can't see the difference, you are one of the ones mentioned.
---
They'd've done it twice before they'd be looking for a new group if I were the leader.
---
i leveled from 1 to 50 as fury. it is easily doable. the trick is: always try to have yellow quests that are 1-2 level below you. fury is the better choice if you also want to tank dungeons while leveling, bceause you will have a 1h weapon on max skill all the time.
---
Right on.
---
Any chance you'd suggest a notable guide for Paladins, Holy or Ret-wise? I'd really love to find a solid hybrid build that focuses more on Holy+Ret than Ret+Holy. Just started playing the class, so, I'm still browsing various ones. Just wasnt sure if there was a notable source on the class (not named Esfand).
---
Stats are what's important for hunter melee weapons. Strength is dookie for you in comparison to a shaman. Shamans need strength and a long swing time. Corpsemaker is 15 strength and 3.9 swing. Best shaman axe for a good while. 
---
The green agility Polearms that drop from the mobs before the boss are better for you. 
---
That's why they were mad. I ran that dungeon 8 times (4 were just to that boss then reset) to get that axe on my shaman. 
---
It's cool being new and not knowing these things, but just because they got mad doesn't mean they're wrong. They could have acted better and explained what's what, but also they might have and you could have ignored them etc etc. None of that matters though. The important thing is just to learn from this. It's a level 29 weapon. It's not going to be the cornerstone of their character if they truly want level 60. It will be a speed bump, though.
---
Vaccinate your crotch goblins.
---
I dont wait 3 hours of queue everyday for non fun server( gehennas eu), and i used to be like that until i got proud of actually knowing a wh9le second language
---
you can apply to other things than portals.... 4Inspiration was talking about agreement involving gold not just portals.
---
No, Guilds does not have banks in Classic.
---
I think that was implemented in TBC or Wrath(?)
---
Yes just create a char and move it to IF/Org infront of the mailbox. Send some bags and gold to unlock the bank slots and you should be ok.
---
PS: rememeber that mails take 1hour to arrive between chars;)
---
People are hitting 60 faster than you think.
---
I rolled a mage and been playing it and my God it's so much easier to level. Compared to a warlock what are the adventages and disadvantage of each? And which do you personally prefer?
---
Yeah you're right, sorry. Long day
---
Druid/shaman comparable in pvp but you'll be praising the heavens you chose shaman if you have any pve inclination (which you should because you'll need to gear up!)
---
Also, there's no specific pet for soloing crazy shit. I believe you're talking about solo DM Tribute runs, and any pet works for that. The trick to soloing tribute comes from dechaining the last two bosses. Basically, you sick your pet on the side kick boss and send your pet to the opposite end of the room. At the same time you tag the big boss and pull him away to a ledge that you kite him on. When your pet dies, the side boss goes back to his throne to chill while you continue to kill big boss. Any pet works for that. It's probably that Blizz won't tether the bosses, so it should be possible.
---
And you can have three pet spots. Usually, I have my leveling/pve solo stuff pet. Then I get my raid wolf. Then I use the last slot to go train all pet skills quickly before I get my pvp bat (or Broken Tooth since ZG isn't out yet.)
---
Other specse/leveling it‚Äôs literally ur only button if you lack AS so...
---
Is pressing alt+tab hard or something?  Or is your computer shit?
---
It's quite easy to mess up from what I've seen. You use multi shot constantly as a part of your single target rotation so you have to pay attention at all times. No other single target dps has that problem. Also managing your pet.
---
It's not the player, it's the class, basically.
---
Look at this guy alt-tabbing first. Single screens are for mobile peasants.
---
I've had 2 crimson whelps drop for me. One was maybe after an hour or two. The second was after about 20 kills on my alt. 
---
Either my luck is broken or the drop rate isn't .5%
---
Mythic+ isnt hard.... its just tedious. Meet certain gear requirements and read your guilds local big brain guide and you cannot fail.
---
Oh shit did i also just describe classic... weird
---
&gt; just grab a gorilla have it tank while you surf Reddit on your second monitor lol.
---
yeah, that's more my speed, haha
---
I dont have 0g.
---
It is not. All it does is making it visible in an addon instead of the combatlog
---
imho, the point is ‚Äúkilling mobs, but also have an opportunity kill player‚Äù. So, normal guys would still focus on game-mobs. And not on insulting other players who come to play a game and instead they cant do shitty just just cause  some rogue have fun killing one noob 99 times. Its PlayerVsPlayer and not dounchbagsVsplayers campersnoliferVsplayers server =/

Aux &gt; Auctioneer? Never used Aux

I been contemplating the transfer. Horde is waaaaay outnumbering Alliance on whitemane. Guess ima endure.
---
People enjoy the games at different paces though, no need to rush if u are enjoying the game as is.
---
Not a good one.
---
A good hunter uses a melee weapon as a stat stick and wing clipper almost exclusively.
---
Dont know, i just stay there and it takes like 20 seconds to scan 22k auctions
---
They also add people.  They were able to increase the number of people allowed on servers at a time with layering.
---
Well that would be Blizzards mistake if that happens.

People are hitting level 60 much faster than they did in the original Vanilla wow. People have much better add ons, guides, computers and internet etc.

Currently living in your little world.  Super happy you think the word full at server select means something.

Go check the AH and compare activity over a week.  Have fun coming back to tell me I'm right.
---
No one has an obligation to stay in a slow group. If the goal is leveling and the group is moving at snails pace, it's literally a waste of time to stay.
---
... I think I'll transfer server instead.
---
I mean grats but when you finish levelling you'll probably do the same for classic since end game isn't your thing. And if it were then you wouldn't have quit bfa in 2 weeks.
---
Rly not sure what your point is other that hurt retail bad, from yet another player that doesn't even play any of the endgame content.
---
I always heard it as "something need doing?"
---
Was doing SFK and Robes of Arugal dropped. There were two cloth-wearers who needed and a hunter. Of course the hunter won. He justified it by saying it has intellect which he needs. Fair play.
---
Then my mind is made up! Thanks
---
A good player doesn't take advantage of free damage?
---
Are you being serious?
---
Name 1 good reason why a hunter wouldn't use their melee weapon near constantly.
---
Why? Shamans more fun in raids?
---
gnome warriors are the same weight as an adult male tauren. gnomes are just denser. compact.

What the hell is a make shift potato? I understand if you use a potato to make random things... like a make shift stamp or something. But what in the ever living hell is make shift potato? A turnip painted brown?

The zone was way too overpopulated for me to complete all of those quests in a timely fashion. Nevermind the opposing faction players in their 40s camping the questgivers. I promptly fucked off. Grinding mobs was more productive.

Level 38, managing mana is part of the fun. My groups clear with speed, and is respectful of waiting until I say it is ok fpr them to start pulling whilst I recover mana.

Started using TSM recently. I've been enjoying the crafting queue task list feature. But, it recently disappeared. Now when I add things to my crafting queue, the task list is missing and I'm not getting the vendor and auction functionality.
---
Is there a way to bring the on screen task list back?
---
Just transfer out of Skeram.
---
Can you please give me some examples?
---
What no one talks about is that most of the changes made to WoW were all things fans complained about and got changed.  They added dungeon finder because people were complaining more and more about how long/hard grouping was for example.  They made leveling easier and dumber because people whined and complained on the forums about leveling alts.  It‚Äôs an interesting example of how a lot of times what we think we want isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs best for us.
---
A dude turned into a bear, someone didn‚Äôt turn into a dude bear.

Yea, didn't mention it in this comment thread. There's the self hosted content, I just don't like it.

Big guilds talk

what about rend set?
---
Right, you said ‚Äúit would literally take longer [than 5-10 seconds] to pick up my phone and unlock it.‚Äù 
---
Point is both methods are fast, just comes down to personal preference, and some people don‚Äôt care about 4K quality images on a damn chat log. Don‚Äôt know why we have to rehash this argument in every single thread.
---
Killlow levels that don't give xp
---
Someone healing a leveling dungeon shouldn't be bound to rolling on healer specific items. They're leveling.
---
Upgrades aren't so specific while leveling, everyone has trash and needs stats.
---
As well as fury right? Or is HS actually better?
---
I mean by the time people use fury ww is worth it always but I'm not sure about it at lower levels.
---
I mean, you just heard about him without being on twitch. I've heard about him without being on twitch. 
---
Him generating a huge amount of press checks out.

Yeah but I also only have 3 days and they only give like 1.3s each
---
I would highly advise AGAINST having a guild bank/ banker because the likelihood of everyone seeing their items again/ bitching about not getting what they deserve is VERY high. 
---
My younger brothers friends all made a guild and they had a banker; they payed 5 G every week to this dude... one day the banker gets access to ranks; de ranks and moves ranks like crazy; guild disbands. There is more to this story but let‚Äôs just say they DID end up with SOME of what they had given but the trust level in the group of friends is gone. 
---
The banker left the guild and the rest rerolled to the other faction. Seriously; unless you 100 percent know that the person trusted with the bank isn‚Äôt going to ninja the fuck out of you... make your own bank alts and tell everyone else to do the same. 
---
This is the truest of the true patches in WoW; don‚Äôt get chewed up and left to die because of it. TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION YOU CAN!!!!!!!!!
---
Good to know. I think I'll try a marksmanship/beast mastery build and see how it goes. Thanks for the advice!

Nibble aka 4 bits is 16 values
---
Oh, Blizzard have done something about these imbalances by introducing cross-realm BGs which are going to be a thing on classic as well.
---
‚ÄúSo I reported him‚Äù
---
Alternatively play 12 hours a day and don‚Äôt stop until a few years later when you‚Äôre like yo wtf oops, that‚Äôs my plan
---
Yes. You see a ton of dumb shit as a tank.
---
Is there any situation in the game where a hunter will opt for melee attacks over kiting and retreating to range? Maybe if the mob is at 1%, in which case that damage increase ain‚Äôt gonna matter much. A rogue has the same claim to a high dps bow to attack fleeing mobs.
---
There are ZERO situations where the best thing a hunter can do is melee dps as a first option. Zero, none.
---
My group stopped cath at 42, exp really slows down around then
---
No he was elemental, specifically. And a hunter wanting it for melee is essentially needing off spec, which is the same a shaman was healing would be doing.
---
Most of the guides I've seen focus on either level 60 builds for each spec, or just leveling via ret w/ questing. Mostly what you're going to want to do is accumulate two sets of gear, one for dungeon healing and one for ret questing. Your stat priorities for healing are going to be +Healing &gt; +MP5 &gt; Intellect &gt; Stamina and your ret priorities are going to be +Attack Power &gt; Strength &gt; Stamina &gt; Intellect (those priorities might be weighted slightly differently depending on who's playing the class, but is a general guide). I would say [these](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503110501--50203001/0g2ACeeeh) are the most important talents for each spec from a leveling standpoint - adding points into each as you feel necessary with your gear to stay relevant. I will add, questing after \~40 without going full Ret will probably feel pretty bad. Also, once you get to the 50s, you'll have some quests like Tirion Fordring's that give BiS pieces for either Holy or Ret, so you'll kind of have to make a choice there which way you want to go.
---
You still have a 16 yard deadzone where they can't charge you but you can hit them.
---
Could be wrong but I'm pretty sure the coded cards have be decoded for many years now xD you could have Googled it while u were on google using the translator xD
---
Ya I'm on fairbanks as well. East of booty bay we couldn't do the bloodsail Buccaneers quest because too many horde where ganking. So we got a 10 main raid of 30s to clear the area for a bit. Was fun when while it lasted haha
---
Yeah but by this logic, prep rouge is really hard to play too!
---
Back in Vanilla, it totally blew peoples minds having prep, pooling energy for a kick, using blind to interrupt, using sap to build combo points.
---
Actually in Vanilla, hunters that could kite were considered incredibly good.
---
I don't think what happened in Vanilla really matters now.
---
Wpvp is the greatest part of this game.
---
i mean watch  [this](https://youtu.be/tqwATrOCTCg?t=264) they are still hinting at it today. its like a bait
---
why divided by 10 and not 8?) (8kbit=1kbait)
---
Yeah I meant if you're using them as a bit array.  16 possible states of on or off.
---
If you join a non real life friend/guild group that is doing content that can drop something big and you don‚Äôt figure that out before you get going that‚Äôs a you problem. 
---
Games built on random drops and people join groups assuming everyone is on the same page is simply not realistic no matter how tight the page you are on is. Lesson learned, ask about loot rights when you join next time.

My razr flip phone took stunning pictures, how dare you
---
I, too, am failing to make the connection.
---
So, retail wow right?
---
do i need to have blacksmithing in order to get the speed boost from mithril spurs?
---
buy low, sell high. varies from server to server, but thick leather is a pretty common flip
---
Windserpents are the answer. Also, their bolt is ranged, so they can put war in combat for you from range, so you can FD Trap the intercept
---
Is it any less automated if they still don't read the tickets or look into anything? It's comedically common to have to resubmit tickets because they never read past the first lone in the first place
---
Only for streamers I think. Something this server talked about during the beta.
---
Ok this is gross
---
After that if you can get Justright'ladim, you can put a new rare spawn in the graveyard, "ghouldilocks"
---
*Insert cheesy lyric about coming up from nothing to something*
---
So mad.
---
If by using melee you mean wing clip and retreating to range, sure. Anything else is suboptimal. And hey, play the game how you want. You wanna melee mobs with a hunter or hell a priest, go for it. But the existence of raptor strike doesn‚Äôt make hunters a melee class.
---
Rogue is really kind of blessed in Classic though. The tryhard classes are really only mage and warrior, and for that reason, any tryhard melee player almost always picks warrior over rogue.
---
Also, endgame warrior outshines rogue in basically every aspect. Of course not literally, but close. Rogue players in classic don't have much to win but the rogue fantasy.
---
Kill the whelps in wetlands to get the pet drop.
---
I'd say more fun in raids healing wise solely because HoT's don't stack which is a nuissance. I'm fairly confident druids are the weakest PvE healers. 
---
Also, having no rez really sucks in dungeons. You can Brez ever, what is it, half an hour? (guessing) But yeah, that's my advice. If the druid playstyle appeals more, go for that. Could always watch a WoW Classic comparison video to help make up your mind.
---
You are at fault, if you aren't contributing your maximum.

Not that easy when you aren't a Mage, Warrior or a Priest.

As a hunter player there are definitely some stupid hunters lol, when I‚Äôm not on my main and I see low level hunters I‚Äôm just very sad. But I was also really bad back in the day so you have to start somewhere.
---
8 hrs a week... man, all the sleep I could be getting haha. I‚Äôm dumping like 10hrs/day into it hah. 
---
But ya you can play at any speed. Log out anytime and pick up where you were. Only thing that takes large chunks of time is dungeons
---
Very impressive... But can you decode
---
just tank when you are leveling all you need is a good shield and rank1 conc.
---
Should have stated that he would be rolling on dps gear.
---
If they are doing xrealm bgs, Which I'm not a fan of but w/e, then just pair the mismatched servers. Like a 75% horde server gets paired with 75% Alli server (adjusting for population too)
---
This man is a warrior.
---
Kinda like the kids who spam LFG looking for 3 mages for 2 hours when if they just ran the dungeon then they‚Äôd have leveled already.
---
This is why I told all my friends I'll be on the RP-PvP server when classic was announced. They're like 'but there's no server names'.
---
Yeah, well there's probably only one (was only one at launch) and it'll be very faction pop balanced because of servers like Emerald Dream on retail.
---
Best decision of my damn live.
---
No worries. Yeah I‚Äôm sure some spots are better than others but as long as you can find a decent clump of green or yellow enemies, knock yourself. Don‚Äôt ignore quests, but I think they‚Äôre more like the cherry on top.
---
But is that 9% more than the Druid pop or 100% more than the Druid pop?  As in Druid is at 10% and mage at 10.9%?  Or 10% and 20%?
---
I have more on my YouTube :D https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgdyswgFk7pcF6SFcNaWthA
---
Yeah for an Ele Shaman thats equally stupid. 
---
I just don‚Äôt like it when people say ‚Äúyou come as Heals you only get healing gear‚Äù in lvl 10-45 dungeons like these guys are speccd healers.
---
TitanPanel Classic!
---
Furry, yuck
---
They‚Äôll have to do *something*, I don‚Äôt imagine the classic playerbase would accept server wipes like the pserver base would, and without some other form of progression you get over-mature, dead servers and insane inflation.
---
Kill rock elementals in north west bad lands (near ish to the horde camp) you will make close to 10g/hr and it will take you a good 4-5 of grinding to level

&gt; Is there any situation in the game where a hunter will opt for melee attacks over kiting and retreating to range?
---
Lets see, killing any mob you intend on letting your pet tank over kiting, that's where they should melee IN ADDITION to ranged.
---
&gt; There are ZERO situations where the best thing a hunter can do is melee dps as a first option. Zero, none.
---
So, while they can do *literally* nothing at range they should just stand there and look pretty instead of using their melee weapon to deal more damage while they wait for their ability to deal ranged damage again?
---
you're gross
---
Try the harpy cave in Thousand Needles, you can get feathers that vendor for 8s each and there is a chest that respawns at a decent rate in it.
---
What do you mean
---
Buddy don't roll on a PvP server if you're connecting humanity's wars to people fighting eachother openly in a video game.
---
Lol he was destroying multiple naxx/aq geared people at the same time.
---
Now were they way worse players than him? Sure, but thats kinda the point.
---
He did things that were impressive even years later
---
Majority of mages have to poly at some point in their career so I doubt you're even close with that estimate
---
not very impressing

---
I wouldn't count it as Ninja looting, he rolled on the item and after a few seconds passed without someone else rolling he assumed nobody else wanted it. Doesn't make the situation any better though.
---
I‚Äôm a rogue and I have trouble against warlocks that seduce me during my opener and create distance while dotting me up. Closing the gap is a death sentence and restealthing is impossible with dots. My only option is to run away and hope to outlive the dots. Getting ganked by a high level lock is curtains as I‚Äôll never survive the dots.  
---
Lower level locks where I could CS-KS- grenade without interruption was too easy. Now at 38, if I see the succubus out I don‚Äôt even bother. I‚Äôm a rogue after all, I pick and choose my own battles :D
---
Blizzard will probably Fun-Detected this and ban it.
---
&gt; He rolled on the item and after a few seconds passed without someone else rolling he assumed nobody else wanted it. Doesn't make the situation any better though.
---
Yes, 1 rage per 3 sec
---
Your late
---
He‚Äôs trying to be a normal person, going to bed at a good time and going to work. Instead, WoW Classic pulls him back in until 1am.
---
I‚Äôm definitely not that guy
---
&gt; Anything else is suboptimal. 
---
Okay, you're gonna have to explain that.
---
How can getting extra damage coming from your melee weapon while losing **0** damage from your ranged weapon be suboptimal?
---
Its 90% more than the druid pop.
---
The general consensus ive seen is that you should mention beforehand if you're going to roll on an item that doesn't go with the spec you're using in the dungeon. If the warrior said "hey I'm going to roll on fury gear since that's my main but I'll tank since we need one for the dungeon" then it's ok. 
---
This is a bit of a grey area in low level dungeons as, for example, even if a tank doesn't mention this beforehand the tank obviously needs dps gear for leveling because nobody levels as prot.
---
He used a boosting service.
---
/sexy has no vocals or sound :)
---
If they aren't healed then they die and get murked from mobs and then there isn't enough dmg to clear so you wipe, which pisses me off as a tank since my repair costs are so high
---
Yeah.  That's my strategy.  For some reason people are wary about starting their own group.  If noone invites me I just LFM and the whispers start rolling in.
---
well you need to observe the AH, use tools like Auctioneer or TSM.
---
there is always a guy that dosent knowthe actual priceing of items. but if you do, you buy then and sell them for a higher price.
---
best example is:
---
I play Horde.
---
My friend found the BiS Holypalabelt on Horde AH for 1 G.
---
he baught it and solt it on the neutral AH for 150 g.
---
while this is somewhat of a best case szenario. there are lots of auctions like that every day.
---
Yeah but I mean I've seen bad players of all classes. There's just so much a hunter can mess up. Though you do notice in pvp when people don't know what to do.
---
Yea, at that point it doesn't matter what kind of loot they're ninja'ing, they're just being dick bags.
---
Burn their names.
---
Open lockboxes in storm wind
---
Nah dude, we have &lt;Lyft&gt;!
---
Hmmmm and people wonder why they can‚Äôt find tanks for dungeons lol
---
I've been using AHDB + BetterVendorPrice. 
---
I think BVP is a prereq for AHDB, but then they will show both vendor pricing and AH pricing. It can auto scan when you open the AH or you can choose to do it manually, too.
---
!remindme 10 hours
---
Yes it does 1 rage per 3 seconds in combat.
---
They focused on atmosphere at the expense of detail. It worked.
---
Zoophiles are disgusting. Last I checked the majority of furries hate them as well, tl;dr two legs fine four legs NONONO.
---
Just clearing up any confusion here. This post wasn't meant to call someone out as a Ninja looter, it was just to show a common human error. Also, the "Congrats" that was posted in the chat was for the item dropping since, both the hunter and the warrior expressed how they were hoping for this item to drop before the run.
---
will alliance/horde get loot designed for the opposite fraction class? Such as horde get paladin loot (literally I mean the int-sta-spi plate)?
---
As far as runs go, it's hard to tell cause different groups do different things and are more/less efficient. 37-40 will probably take 4-8 hours depending on how long it takes to find a group and replace people as they drop.
---
If Horde, shellfish. If alliance, grind.
---
This is trashy.
---
Not even close lol. Most popular pserver is like a low pop classic server if that.
---
Have someone loan you 35g and trade it back after securing the bag
---
You can farm. Steady 12g an hour as a 39 in Desolace.
---
Theres no excuse not to have a mount at 40 lmao.
---

---
Seems like a lot of effort. Can you solo any other dunegon more quickly for gold?
---
indoors =/= rested zone
---
He calls himself a gamer? Pfft.
---
yeah i know its important. I'm just trying to figure how important it is because the build I'm thinking I  have  to either  sacrifice imp counterspell or winter chill and like I stated its not  a pvp only build otherwise it would be easy to decide.  I know only 1 mage needs to be the winter's chill mage for raids but at the same time it would be nice to have that talent.
---
I open with it for 2 levels when I get a new rank.
---
Farm crabs and do the repeatable turn in quest in desolace. Easy 12g an hour.
---
It's a rare world drop meaning it will drop from anywhere with the appropriate level at an extremely low drop chance we're talking probably hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of kills before you could even begin to expect to have seen it.
---
Dual respec or free respec is a hard pass for me. Roll a class/spec and deal with it. Put some effort into it and don‚Äôt expect to be given a new character basically leveled free. Just my opinion.

I was just thinking better to have a tank that might roll against you than no tank. But these people play easy mode classes that can farm I get to suffer their bullshit when they join dungeon groups. So I roll on what I need if I‚Äôm in a dungeon where the only loot I need is offspec I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm probably rolling. Especially if I‚Äôve seen the thing 3-4 times and have passed.
---
Alright, thanks for answering, and gratz to your mount! I'll try out rotgrip again. Hopefully I can endure the mara spam though, people here underestimate how dull it can get.
---
Imagine people having lives outside of the game and the fact that most of the playerbase is probably still working towards their first mount
---
No you do not. Look at the mount description, note how the only requirement is level 60 on other mounts that is not the case, they require x riding skill as well.
---
There isn't really much plate with those kind of stats in vanilla. Most of the pre-raid, and raid BIS for holy paladins are actually cloth and leather and not plate.
---
So, i was in a dungeon earlier, im a mage, and the tank was complaining about my threat generation until he finally kicked me out, thing is, i have the talent for reduced threat and i was trying to give him enough time every pull before i started to cast anything
---
Am i bad at the game? is he? is there anything else i should've done? Obviously im pissed about getting kicked out when i don't think i was doing anything wrong, but i thought, might as well ask if i was wrong
---
Yeah I had the idea that it wasn't in yet and Wowhead is just wrong about it being in phase one.

Were you trained in the way of finding Zhevra hooves? If not, you are nothing here.

I easily made 100g in a couple of days at lvl 32 doing the same thing. Keep buying Thick Leather for less than 6s50c. Turn in to Nightscape Tunic and vendor. At 5s (generally the cheapest they go for on my AH) it's a profit of around 2s per leather, or 14s per craft, or 40s per stack. 10 stacks, that's 4g. I can usually buy 10-20 stacks a day. Scan AH, buy up, when you're low on cash, craft and sell. Make sure I've got plenty of bag space and queue up a big craft at the end of the day, 40-50 units. Wake up, do it again.
---
the editting is so damn stupid i love it
---
For my hunter I had to get Gorefang from Silverpine, the rare worg. The blacks look cool but I just had to have that rare look and stand out some more
---
That wand dps after half a minute.
---
To expand, people like to raid on wednesdays and sundays. So you buy all the Elemental Fire for a low price on monday or friday and sell high on wednesday or sunday.  
---
edit: same applies to mana potions
---
Alchemists are also going to need them for ZG. You need blood of heroes to make the mats to summon the ZG Madness boss.
---
I feel like many players start playing hunters but abandon them by lvl20-ish (since Hunters are pretty hard and intricate class) and reroll mage. I've seen mostly hunters in starter zones, now there's only mages.
---
Yeah, i luckily haven't burned out on it yet, grinding again to get a good gold stack to invest for phase 2. I just put on some spotify and grind away for my daily 3-4h maraudon runs.
---
Demonshear and deathbone?
---
Yep, I don‚Äôt really exclude classes myself but I mean some people have a real problem losing rolls. I bring people that can do good damage and limit mistakes. This blue loot doesn‚Äôt matter in the long run for a serious player it‚Äôs just a stepping stone.
---
At least in the league of legends reddit they allow it if there's sufficient proof of what the player is being accused of.  Witch hunts are generally based on a lack of evidence.  If there's proof of the misdeed it's not a witch hunt anymore.  I'm not sure where this thread lies on that specific idea though.
---
You don‚Äôt even have to install an app, Windows 10 had native support but some apps copy paste the URL string for you...
---
Never mentioned anything about resetting a password either, learn to read.
---
There is a rare worg in that area too, named Gorefang which has a light grey fur and looks great
---
Thanks for writing this. I have been feeling a bit upset that I haven't been able to play as much as I wanted because, well, adult life. It really is about revisiting an old familiar place where I spent a sizable amount of time as a kid. Who cares about the level - I'm only 31. By chipping away here and there, I know that hitting 60, whenever that happens, will be even more rewarding than it was 15 years ago.
---
no draculas from castlvania
---
I can count on 1 hand the number of times I was ganked in stv. Actually funnily enough 2 of those times were a warrior/paladin combo. Wonder if it was the same dudes...
---
good move by the rogue, but really he should wait you engage a mob.

Top comment:
---
&gt; When this is applied to a melee weapon, it affects a druid's feral form attack speeds. Currently in cat form I attack at .97 speed. Nothing huge, but a curiousity.
---
I don't know further than that.
---
This is my long-term plan to get back at those damned Alliance for snagging me at 10% health or killing me as higher level in groups..
---
Jokes on you i‚Äôm going to STV to make all the lowbies quit playing. The ones who ganked me will be the only ones left on the server :P
---
"well tough shit!"

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/damcho/60_rogue_swords_now_what/). 
---
:D, I love it!
---
Gotta give us an update OP! The masses want to know what happened with the report
---
If you want your guild to love you, 30/11/10 lets you be the blessing master while having great heals. You can pick up every Blessing talent except Blessing of Sanctity. Just to burden you with more options.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxhrgoxxGzZE
---
Also, stack Spirit as your main stat while leveling, followed by strength, then a little bit of int. Will let you heal just fine without switching gear unless your group is terrible, and you'll never have to rest while grinding so you can chain pull forever.
---
Are you watching twitch on the side there? Whats the addon?
---
What do you mean by wave? There are ton of guilds at 8/10 MC alr.
---
Literally not even what was being discussed. We're talking about personal awareness, not the amount of press he has. Go be pedantic somewhere else.
---
You can view your watch history and remove old videos to affect that algorithm. I don't know if you can go that far back, but I've had weeks when I'm in the mood for a style of video outside of my norm. When it passes I just go back and remove them all from my history and it stops recommending things based on those videos again.
---
S'Mores cereal!
---
SGC is just about worth the same as T1 chest. 12 agi vs 1 crit.
---
If you‚Äôre in range for melee something has gone wrong. That very situation is suboptimal. Hunters are a *ranged class*.
---
Tell the alliance to stop being dicks and camping in front of Blackrock and we won‚Äôt have to Zerg the fuck out of them. I had my raid in a molten core and literally like 35 of us had to step out to stop the alliance from being dicks. 
---
Most of us horde just want to do our raids.
---
As said I did try at 1.79g but they didn't always sell, and even 1.59g didn't sell in first 8hrs always. So it's not really a good idea to put it higher than that on my server. As said, auctionator would put them at 1.3g as there's some always for that price, it's the mass buyers who empty the whole AH who sometimes bring the price up a bit.
---
Found the ret that is 10% of my dps and brings less to the table than a holy paladin in greens.
---
only black colored Lion in the game
---
It‚Äôs kinda more funny cause context. The guy just whispered him 50/50 and then that happens
---
Fair enough. I try not to be a dick but I'm aware I'm enjoying the atmosphere RPers provide without really contributing anything, so I feel a bit bad. I don't really know enough about lore to contribute to a lot of stuff even if I wanted.
---
Yeah, I don't get it.
---
Has nobody ever played DnD where half the races are some kind of human/animal?
---
Or watched any Disney movie from the 90s or earlier?
---
If you see a doodle of an anthro race and your mind instantly jumps to porn then boy do I have news for you.
---
I think its because that guy, Jokered, was the first person to hit 60 and he did it as a mage. 
---
Nothing against Jokered. Hitting 60 in 3 days is very difficult even with a mage. But I think thats where the popularity came from.
---
As a warrior I do this all the time and 9/10 times groups fill in minutes
---
What race?
---
Love the old school vibe man, the music and all is great. Put a smile on my face after a long day at work and not playing wow.
---
I hope your just joking because this was a great message to a lot that have a skewed perspective.
---
I‚Äôve gone through the same feelings as you. And am right there with you, enjoy the journey. We‚Äôll be 60 one day and it really will feel awesome!
---
Yes. It has nothing to do with the post.
---
https://i.imgur.com/6SSe7Pz.png
---
Heres my setup.
---
Cachexic, Zachary and Gameking are at the very least equal to Vurtne, if not better.
---
Only difference is they didn't gimp themselves by not gearing, so the people with no gear gravitated toward Vurtne.
---
Which s why I always wondered why so many wonderfully designed areas were left abandoned
---
No, they should *kite and focus on getting to range*. This is not a difficult concept.
---
If your melee weapons have attack power and agility it benefits your bow attacks... you should really read some hunter guides or at least do basic math if you are trying to argue the validity of trash weapons on a Hunter. If your weapons don‚Äôt give attack power, agility, or Crit it is not a hunter weapon.
---
I played hunter in mists/wod and currently have a 60 here on classic.
---
I rolled an ally rogue,camping him there revenging how they massacred my warrior boy
---
Can‚Äôt tell if bait or not... hmm
---
Literally never heard of the dude and I played during Vanilla and a bit in BC.
---
Except equipping those things really messes with your stats, especially if you arent a cloth wearer.
---
is there any weakauras around can suggest (specifically) that would be beneficial for classic?
---
Hmm. I honestly think you have to state it if you're rolling off spec. I always say if I need dps gear as a tank.
---
Yeah they do that all the time, lock player here. Most mages around lvl 45 seriously try to 1v1 a lock in close combat, usually also completly ignoring my felhunter. 
---
As someone that loves mages, and played one most of the time in WoW it makes me angry and sad at the same time.
---
So why not join the lfg chat? What‚Äôs this addons difference to the chat?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs very profitable, I agree. Only problem is that every time I go there, there are at least 2-3 other people farming them. If I could have it to myself, I probably could get 10g an hour. Sometimes I wish I was on a less popular server.
---
If you really want to play paladin and do what you want to do to have fun, don‚Äôt go to the internet. Exploring your class in classic was one of the great experiences I had at least back in vanilla. And when you go to a guide online, your playing something that someone else likes. Your obviously not happy with how your currently playing, so do what you want :D
---
Your choice; bows are better end game from my research unless you are really lucky! Either way will be about the same ( I would always go by DPS).
---
The only reason I would go gun is to have the skill in case I find a gun in the future that has better stats. Just remember if you DO go gun to find some green, then yellow mobs to get your skill up.
---
ha my man!
---
Healing touch a billion times.
---
Hots aren't worth it, they are super mana intensive and the healing isn't enough until you are geared well. (Not this tier)
---
Worse. You'll get tier pieces for the other faction
---
I didn't think you could do that, interesting.
---
I could be wrong but I‚Äôm pretty sure pets can only have 4 abilities, excluding stam, armor and resistance abilities. You might have to respec your pet at the pet trainer if you have more than 4 active abilities
---
Or if you enter a raid with dead bosses in it. Be careful of that as you can still farm trash if bosses are dead
---
I know, I have this weird habit of calling online stranger's gender by their in-game characters. It makes sense to me because I don't know who they are initially, and I know it is very likely that they're a he.
---
Forget all the "leveling guides" and just grab the addon questie
---
Our Guild raided Camp Taurajo last night and the battle that followed was legendary
---
&gt;  until 1am.
---
Ofc its worth it. I only pay sub for classic ill NEVER set foot in retail ever again. 
---
If your idea of fun is hard content.. Go play FF14. 
---
Classic is about FUN.
---
What damage and functionality do I gain? Because while at short range I can use BOTH melee and ranged weapons, meaning every tool in my kit is available too me in addition to providing me extra damage from melee attacks.
---
I‚Äôm in the lfg chat but more ppl use this addon than the chat
---
Did you take this by recording your monitor with you phone. I thought we had all talked about this...
---
Journey before destination.
---
Item rack has been quick fixed
---
With high spirit you regenerate mana and health faster, and paired with Spirit Tap in shadow you more or less kill with almost no downtime. Casting shield and do the rotation with Holy fire, SW:Pain, Mind Blast, 2x Mindflay, and wand them to death you've spent about 50% of your mana, trigger the Spirit Tap on kill and regenerate back to 90% in a very short period of time. Priests are pretty decent levlers because of this. Eventually you'll prioritize Spirit for the regeneration rate and intellect to increase the mana pool for raids.
---
Sneakytom, the gimped rogue I see dead outside BRD after failed ganks constantly? lol
---
*You‚Äôre*
---
Still using dad to get ahead, not surprising.
---
Okay, lets take it 1 more time.
---
You're not choosing melee OVER ranged, you're chosing melee IN ADDITION to ranged.
---
How can you not understand that that's more damage?
---
If memory serves that piece was later added to the artists DA gallery, where they explained that they wanted to see how long it would take for someone to notice the implication. I'm surprised whoever approved it for the official site didn't catch on immediately.
---
fully agree
---
You need a GPS in there
---
What nickname are we going with?
---
Why yes I did! My apologies, I missed the conversation. What's a good screen capturing method?
---
Ye, much easier to blame the hunter for a mistake he was only allowed to make because they made a mistake first.
---
Damn. That would not be cheap.
---
Ehh hunters are still largely trash. They‚Äôre all just as bad if not worse than the average mage I‚Äôve played with.
---
The huntard stereotype is still very much alive.
---
Will I be expected as a main heal or am I mostly there for BR and innervate with back up heals
---
Nope. Still have met more retarded hunters than any other class.
---
Adam Jones sans Chewbacca ‚Äòstache
---
Timing is everything
---
yes since eventually you'll need rep for naxxramas
---
It's on how to accurately predict (and influence) what targets your MS is gonna hit.
---
I've been tanking dungeons like crazy on my paladin and you're mostly playing best :)
---
I love pulling the whole group of trolls at the bottom of the pyramid at once... it's the best
---
I had a low rogue spit on me in the middle of booty bay.. I guess he thought he was safe. He learned 2sec later he made a mistake lol. Vanish ftw.
---
farm the turtles along the river in hillsbrad. the clam meat and small lustrous pearls are good vendor items or to sell to a cook. the iridescent pearls go for about 1g in most servers
---
Warlocks are seldom invincible if you can break fear and are quick on the intercept
---
You wont miss out on too much until phase 6 with the undead invasion.
---
Huh, I guess I should have checked a little harder. I check the sub every so often, but hadn't seen this. Oh well, now it's moved onto my fishing pole.
---
If you can kite and retreat, you should do that instead of yoloing it from melee. Always.
---
It's replaced at about 38-40 either way, do what you want it's not relevant for that long.
---
I‚Äôve never made a macro in WoW before, but surely you can add some sort of delay (1 or 2 seconds) so that any cool down has completed?
---
BR/Innervate/Raid healing primarily.
---
And remember to factor in the time it costs to make them if the difference is marginal!
---
Had a guy hit me with "arms for the poor". My guy couldn't even beg correctly.
---
what level are you?  I use Seal of wisdom for trash
---
Judgment of wisdom and then seal of righteousness for single target
---
to be fair people AoE farmed back then too, it's just much more prominent now
---
gun in that case, it's the slower one and you have no racial bonuses
---
Duskwood and that bit above ashenvale are alliance version of barrens chat
---
There's plenty of reasons. Just because you're genetically strong doesn't mean you can't keep animals and practice archery, and if you've been doing it from a young age, you'll lean more towards that than becoming a disciplined soldier. Plus, it's not a bad strategy to bring another half ton murder machine to a battle. Rexxar is almost as big as his bear...
---
Realistically, a human warrior (let alone gnome) stands no chance against many creatures on Azeroth, they'd be easily stepped on by larger foes and obliterated by magical ones. But they don't let that get in their way.
---
Moonkin sucks until BC. It‚Äôs either feral or resto in classic.
---
I mean he offered 50%. i woulda been happy just getting my money back.
---
Okay, you have to be trolling at this point, but I will try again.
---
What benefit do I gain from that? Because the only effect I see is the lack of melee damage.
---
The axe is the best weapon in general and you've got the axe racial so you can cut through mobs 1 level under you like butter with the axe.
---
Are you serious?
---
Hi, /u/VDr4g0n

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/damkmy/best_classes_for_a_group_of_4_noobs/).

When I was 44 I did some "spellcleave" ZF runs as a lock with 3 mages and a priest. It was great exp so when a 45 mage later said lf1m ZF aoe zombies, I whispered that I was a 44 lock and can easily carry my weight doing it with them. He responded, "sorry we're actually trying to speed level, not carry a warlock" so I just kept questing. 6 hours later I was level 46 and he was still level 45 and looking for mages for his speed leveling groups...
---
I think OP was implying it was not an XP cleave group, but rather a regular 5 man. If it was cleave, I agree completely, though.
---
If you ever plan on raiding Naxx, you'll need to be at least honored with them iirc.
---
Necrosis is a great Warlock Addon, basically everything you need.
---
There‚Äôs a repeatable quest in desolace that has a pretty decent payout. Basically you‚Äôre diving underwater and interacting with cages and hoping you get shellfish out. 5 shellfish get turned in for 55s.
---
Rp
---
Retail
---
Omg what nightmare is this shit
---
Cool story
---
Pretty sure it's even 1:1 copied
---
Auto loot ftw
---
Yeah do some early STV quests and then go to Desolace. Do green quests as well if you're struggling and find yourself too low for the next proper zone. Still goes quite fast to just farm an entire level when you're around 30 so that's an option too.
---
I uh.. Recognise the art style from porn.
---
If you ever want to raid without being an asshole to your guild, then yea it's a bad idea.
---
Had a random rogue ninja all loot in Arms last night.. haven‚Äôt gotten that heated from a vidya game in years.
---
I think everyone started out polite in classic and its moving it's way to being toxic now, maybe getting a lot of younger immature players or people just losing patience with how effing slow everything is in classic. Not always the case there are still awesome people I'm just seeing more or the negative creep in.
---
Wait what. I‚Äôve been strafing away from frost nova this whole time and never been attacked. What are you talking about?
---
Awesome. Sounds good
---
It changes depending on the levels of your group.  Do one run, note where you are at to start, at the end let's say you gained 4 bubbles on xp bar.  So 5 runs per level and add 1 or 2 runs because you'll need more xp higher levels.
---
As soon as I saw venruki and co. Destroying SM with mages during the beta, I started to get worried as a mage. The fact is no matter what game it is, there will always be people aiming to be the most efficient. This is definitely the case with the spellcleave meta since level 60 is a huge goal for a lot of players. As for people rerolling their main mage solely due to the reputation of the class is silly in my opinion. If anything, this just motivates me to prove that I can actually be a good mage
---
If you kill the head of the multibox, the other 4 don‚Äôt do anything. It use to be like that when I played a couple years. Has that changed?
---
Last try:
---
Ranged &gt; melee
---
Finishing off a mob? Fine, give em a raptor strike and be done with it.
---
Mob with more than 5%? Your damage should *always* be higher if you retreat and fire from ranged.
---
I'm done talking past you, so this will be my last message in this exchange.
---
Have a nice day!
---
Where in Azshara?  PM me if you wanna keep between us
---
This is the legion client so it's not how it was back in 2005
---
Why did you roll? So your garbage dps can be a little less garbage?
---
He's a grimtotem, he deserve it.
---
I‚Äôve come across some girls on my server that are playing girl characters so I just call em by their game character to be safe lol
---
No, there's no possible way of justifying it.
---
Because people assume it's a drop instead of finding out a vendor sells it 100%.  Plus it's far away.
---
I'm the same. Any female character is a she for me unless otherwise proven.
---
Best classes for a group of 4 noobs? So me and 3 friends are all gonna start playing Wow classic. We never played Wow before and tbh have little MMO experience in general. Any tips focused on our entire group? Like should we all be different classes? If so which 4 would be good? We're going to be playing exclusively as a party so soloing and whatnot isn't really a concern. I'm the only person who plays videogames... so in terms of classes, which should I play if I'll be carrying my group? Thanks guys.
---
Okay and my last try.
---
Ranged **+** Melee &gt; Ranged &gt; Melee.
---
How can you legitimately not understand this?
---
So what is the difference between them and what is wrong about the chat that makes need for a replacement?
---
Spent a good few hours trying today but only with 50% max movement speed. Will have to retry with epic mount at some point.
---
One person is not the whole group. Sometimes one must die for the good of the many.  If saving you kills everyone else then you die.
---
Start a group yourself. It may take a while but if you're mature and friendly people will end up joining. Particularly watch out for people in LFG saying "Tank/healer LFG", snatch them up and build from there.
---
Just have somewhere to grind or quest while you do it lol
---
Incorrect statement? Are you kidding me right now? How would that install process on desktop be longer than doing it on mobile when it's the same process in essence? SMFH. Don't even have to get a Reddit app because it's a website lmfao.
---
Form a group yourself / run with your guildies / make friends ingame and run with them etc.
---
Works like an onion tastes like nothing because it's software
---
My fianc√© ran it once 12 years ago and promptly swore it off. He couldn‚Äôt remember why until the other day when we wiped.
---
/r/JustBootThings
---
Face-palm
---
No straightforward answer for that sadly. Easiest way is to have friend, or a guild. Making your own group is also an option, don't be afraid to whisper individual people.
---
You could probably get 6-8 gold an hour pickpocketing SM library. That's how I got my mount at 40.
---
Yeah macros can do a lot but have no slots left pretty much. How I wish there were more available macro slots. On private server the addon "Supermacro" was a godsend. It gave you something like 30 additional macro slots. Also didn't have to put those macros on a skillbar. You could keybind the supermacro slots in the interface. I really would like to have an addon for classic that gives you more macro slots.
---
I agree with you. Everyone on the RP server should be roleplaying that's literally the one and only purpose of RP servers. All it takes is one guy that breaks the RP and it will make a lot of people stop. And what's even the point of RP realm if not everyone role plays.
---
Ohhhhh!!! Thanks for clarifying!!!
---
It‚Äôs this kind of stuff that makes me glad I play rogue. :D
---
Your GF shares enough of her moist cornbread for everyone
---
Jesus stop shitting on mages so hard. Been playing for 13 years now i have to feel guilty because of other people being bad?
---
&gt;she's a bitch and the reason I'm such a fucking insecure tanker.
---
ya gotta change your mindset if you're gonna tank man. think of yourself as the king emperor of the group, always be the leader and always have the power. the group can still go on after you kick one dps, but the group cant go on if the tanKING doesnt want to.
---
5 man healing is fun on pally, healing wack a mole
---
Thanks man!
---
Please dont turn this sub into /r/wow with 99999 comission art posts
---
I think you're right
---
You're telling people what's enjoyable when it's subjective
---
Every little thing you do in Classic matters and nothing is given to you for free. And because of that you need others and others need you. In retail they could as well just give you your endgame character from the beginning. It has become a glorified Diablo.
---
cool story bro
---
Right because poor people own thousand dollar TVs lol
---
The axe for axe spec on orcs is a huge upgrade. Don't get the sword
---
Your opinion is bad and you should feel bad
---
So I am currently level 31 and I have 28 gold to my name. I want to buy my mount first thing after i get to level 40. My skinning just hit 225 but the 5g on artisan training seems a lot right now. Is there any benefit to it ?
---
I been tryna tell people. That dungeon is just not worth it at all.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, not saying you all peruse it, just saying that this image is so innocent and light that only mean people/perverts would liken this or this style to pornography
---
"Hmmm...I have aggro on 4 elite mobs that are all around 50% health and frost nova is down.  Should I stop dps and blink to the tank?  Nah."
---
  *cone of cold, blinks away, dies*
---
At least I have chicken
---
Nice b8 8/8
---
Nice try boy
---
How are the warlocks in raids? Will it be easy for me to find a group?
---
They hate us cause they ain't us, have fun walking everywhere :)
---
how to get to feralas?
---
If you waited for a hunter to quest for an hour, then that‚Äôs on you
---
Charge is a 25yd range and yours is 40yd. If you see them coming they shouldn't even touch you. Scatter trap is a great tool to have, you could also spec into a generalist WPvP spec and have Intimidate at the same time. Deterrence goes a long way to making you survive if they get the jump on you, and you'd benefit from investing in a handful of Free Action Potions, which you want to poo before the Hamstring lands.
---
protect your arms! atleast wear a shirt or whatever
---
And probably your as bad as in classic at all of them
---
Guns sound terrible.
---
Rouge starts to take off at 22? Ill give him until then, then. Made a rouge with solid gear for the lvl (now lvl 17) and im having problems taking on mobs a level lower than me still. Was going to scrap him but ill hold off
---
Nope.jpg
---
Moonkin‚Äôs aren‚Äôt viable till BC.
---
It‚Äôs wow I like my mouse and keyboard it‚Äôs the reason I bought them lol
---
Thanks a lot
---
For your purposes, not really. With skinning capped at 225, you can skin up to level 45 beasts. Anything above that you wouldn't be fighting until well after you get your mount, so you can afford to delay training artisan skinning.
---
I envy your innocent and imaginative enjoyment.  I can't get this sort of feeling from games anymore :(
---
I used to very much as a kid and teen, i would get utterly lost in books but now I seem to be a bit dead inside lol

Of course it is man.

WoW is an rpg. There is lots of gear to equip in the game, and some of it is ideal for stats. 
---
But the most important thing about gear in rpg games is that if you want to wear something, you *can*.  There's nothing wrong with it.
---
I'm a lifelong toker and for some reason playing wow stoned is no good. I do stupid things, forget where I'm going or what I was even doing. This game really is like a full time job
---
But it's not.  You aren't outnumbered 3 to 1.
---
Using the mechanics in a way that was no intended. In my opinion, that is abusing mechanics. That does mean it's cheating, I never said anything about cheating. Mages are the only class who can do that type of AoE farming, and it can make it more difficult for people trying to quest/level in the intended way.
---
I'm not saying it's a bad thing to AoE farm, just that doing so is using the mechanics in an unintended way. 
---
People sure are quick to get butthurt on here.

In the BM tree, pet crits increased party damage
---
Who hurt you
---
Go gnome, make everything there is for gnomish, and then respec goblin. You won‚Äôt miss anything by doing this.
---
Hi, to know that, you need to check reputation at every quest that you turn in. I didn't made that, so I can't answer.
---
That is insane! Glad you're having fun! How have you not gotten annoyed of the starting zones?
---
What? At what point did I have an agenda against AH addons, I use them myself too daily and I see this. Ofc people who manually do it contribute as well, but the fact that addons make the whole thing so fast and easy is what really pushes the prices.
---
&gt;literally take hundreds of people
---
Yes, welcome to a populated server in 2019 where it's rather common knowledge what you can do with addons and how you can play the AH for profit with them, that's exactly what you get.
---
Now make the opposite where literally everything expires
---
Lock is crazy useful and if played well, can easily keep up with a mage.
---
You have so much utility: soulstones, healthstones, summon, curses that prevent fleeing,increase cast times weaken and slow, not to forget the curse of elements. You have succ seduce and banish which let's you CC something in any instance.
---
In some cases where your group accidentally pulled the entire room you have 3 fears one being aoe to save the day.
---
Lock is a way deeper and more versatile class than mage.
---
Regarding groups: people need to understand that in vanilla you build your own groups. Lazily spamming in LFG will not get you far. Build groups, befriend good players, invite them again.
---
36 health regen a minute? Sounds kinda useless to me
---
Also also, your pets dps is a joke in raid. You have a wolf just for the AP buff.
---
Yes, look it up on youtube
---
Why did you make a bullet for the word hey
---
Its been warriors for me. Mages can def be annoying but warriors almost always fit the old huntard bill. I had a fucking warrior need roll a sword that had 1% SPELL crit chance on it and nothing else for his fucking off spec when its my pre-bis and yeah im salty bout it still.
---
Also all the warriors in their late 50s thinking they can still 2h fury tank instead of just getitng a fuckin shield.
---
It‚Äôs wow I can see everything in front of me pretty good I don‚Äôt really need to see the edge of the screen but I just sit at a good distance if I wanna see everything it‚Äôs kinda nice sitting kinda close makes you feel like you are actually there because everything is right in front of you and huge almost like VR
---
Am a druid but if I feel the same way as you do, i would also prefer the sword.
---
Running MC with 9 mages in the group is less than ideal. &gt;.&lt;
---
It did for me. 22 is vanish, so if you pull to much, you can still survive. I'm Subtley and now have 75% chance to get an extra combo point out of Ambush, which is hige.
---
Most rogues level with Combat. I've never tried it.
---
That's good to know! I was under the impression some things don't really change though; such as how quick Elemental OOM, or how bad Enhancement is?
---
Yeah, should say that. It's like when people reserve loot, if they say beforehand i know not to join and waste my time.
---
Okay money bags
---
Depends on what you compare it to. I could complete all the raids 14 years ago when I was a worse player but I can't complete mythic raids in retail, they're way too difficult. I don't think it's a good thing making the game that hard, Classic was much easier and accessible at the top end which is what made the game great.
---
If he told you that he wants to finish those quests first then just kick him and find someone else, as long as he told you what he was doing it's kinda on you for just waiting
---
Because I love pumpkins and Halloween is close lol you are the only one to point that out
---
Hi, you're welcome. I don't plan to make a horde version for now, especially when it means you need to get a new account with horde character (can't be on both faction on classic)
---
Can't read cats, bro
---
Right now not great but it's pretty easy to get a raid spot they need a couple of us. Later on we become what mages are now.
---
Haha, ran a Stockades run earlier today and the hunter was being the huntard, multishotting mobs that weren‚Äôt pulled. Pulling more mobs when the healer was drinking and complaining we weren‚Äôt going fast enough. I had the tank whisper me at the end saying he expected me to be the one doing it.
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the chat, the problem is nobody uses it. I‚Äôm on EarthFury, one of the low pop realms. This addon is basically mandatory if u want to run dungeons.
---
"gnomer" ugh
---
So what‚Äôs the update on your story
---
If she's fat, it doesn't count.
---
I don't see why people give a shit. It's a little throwaway bit of humor, does it need to be HD.
---
&gt;since Hunters are pretty hard and intricate class
---
missed the /s
---
I‚Äôm a new hunter that gets fucked yo by warriors.  Where is this 16 yard range?  Any guides or videos you‚Äôd suggest?
---
We're talking about people in your guild. Definitely tell them no but "fuck off" is a bot much.
---
I mean, taking the back entrance would cut it down a bit, especially if you only want the final boss. Of course that requires at least one of you to have the key, but not the tallest order.
---
There is no risk in bfa
---
when there's no risk there's no excitement

goblin, gnome is better for melee due to the net

Upvoted and hope your comment gets a lot of visibility because it seems like an important caveat.

Yeah I did sfk last night and all 3 dps were mages. Needless to say. I got no loot.

There's a place in Darkshore that has done this since forever.
---
That's the crux of the issue; I don't mind the odd bit of respeccing, but I have no interest in weekly respecs to go from a PvE spec to a PvP one. I don't enjoy playing a healer either (though love doing a heal spell here or there when needed, whilst I DPS as my main thing).
---
I guess whoever downvoted me figures it‚Äôs ok to spit on people haha. Then act surprised when they get ganked. Oh well..
---
/r/wow is leaking
---
This is different. Tanks are more in demand. The group would have a lot easier time replacing a melee dps okay with sharing rolls with the tank, than finding a tank that is okay with not rolling on melee dps gear. 
---
If you have a problem with that, then either make your own groups, or reroll warrior.
---
Could I do it on a druid for the tunic?
---
Truth, the server rollout split my guild so badly that I was left hitting 60 with basically nobody I know to play with, and if anything is going to make me quit after the first month, it's that (not nostalgia shock or anything, leveling was fun).
---
Classic: perfect for anustart

I prefer the commands in that order bc it means my pet is already halfway to the target by the time the Shot hits
---

---
So I see there has been talk about mages being the new hunters, and I am here to correct the record. Hunters get so scared the second a mob looks at them they just lay on the ground and pretend to die. Now here is the fundamental difference between the hunter and I, the chad Mage: When the mob looks at us, we pop about 4 cooldowns and then actually lay down and die, none of this pretending bullshit. Thank you for giving me the time to correct this baseless misinformation going around.
---
It's a SHAME they can't kill you anymore for that.
---
If you have GPS, it may be a fast run

There used to be an addon that would overwrite any soundtriggers with custom sounds. Maybe this will help you. Can't recall the name, but maybe someone can fill in?

You both sound retarded.

Meanwhile, I look like a moving rainbow :P Still proud!
---
Im talking about bit arrays.
---
If you have 16 things to track on or off, you can store all 16 states in one ushort.
---
This is often used for permissions etc.  In c# it's called a bitflag enumeration.
---
You can use bitwise operators to turn on/off multiples flags at once.
---
Never been on one, what are you talking about?
---
Too bad I'm neither of those. Also, priests? Not mages, but priests? How's that?

I personally chose grom gol for my travel hub.
---
Happens to me too. Toggle the dark/light background and it'll temporarily fix it for that quest
---
Just out of curiosity, do the mobs resist at all?  What level can you start pickpocketing SM?
---
You are right, however my thoughts regarding this was that for me a few changes can be made and still keep the classic feels alive. I did not play that much in Classic, had just dinged 60 about a month prior to TBC release so I'm sure that people that really did play a lot wants to go back to the exact version of the game like it used to be and I completely respect that.
---
This is a secret? A breadcrumb quests sends you to do it and you see it's repeatable when you're there.
---
This x300. I don‚Äôt ever ask for tips. Opened 20 boxes once . I was happy as hell to do it

Not to mention posted his realm, and you can see his char name in the screenshot. Guess he's just desperate to be blacklisted.
---
I still use the razer Naga molten edition.
---
I just don't understand this childish mentality.  Tanks are rare enough as it is.  Telling them they are 'terrible' is just an awful thing to do.  I'm really sorry you encountered such a moron.
---
Completely agree. Just a few days ago we  were questing in Arathi and were killing some alliance players who were killing our quest mobs. We were 3, they were solo, but we need the mobs for the quest item drops... well we killed one rogue a few times and he then called his big bro, a level 60 hunter who then camped us a bit. We then asked some people for help who then hunted the hunter.
---
You don‚Äôt get this interaction on PvE servers because you can just deactivate pvp and move on. You have no incentive to ask others for help because you can easily help yourself.
---
His point is perfectly valid. There‚Äôs 20+ other servers that don‚Äôt have RP in the title with the same rule set. Why roll on an RP server if you won‚Äôt RP.
---
You also seem to imply that because it‚Äôs fun for the person doing it, that it can‚Äôt possibly be wrong. Well that persons fun can negatively impact 100s of others, it‚Äôs just about being reasonable and not acting like everything was made for your enjoyment alone.
---
Also, lots of people find aim bots in shooting games fun, but it makes the game less fun for everyone else, which is why cheaters are looked down on. 
---
There is nothing wrong with someone having the opinion that someone who will not RP should not roll on an RP server.
---
He num locked too hard.
---
I get the opposite feeling - when all my stuff sells I get nervous that I put it up too low!
---
sword spec &gt; axe spec though
---
God damn and i switched to deviate delight alliance
---
thanks man, getting some inspiration.
---
isnt that set super hard to get? like its drop rate is pretty low or something... not sure
---
Where did you go?
---
I think that was the Uruk Hai and not normal orcs?
---
Are you... sure about that?
---
You would need the shafowforge key and to be able to sneak by the mobs. Without distract you will need to be higher level. Should be able to do it 57+.
---
You could definitely solo plugger though.
---
Gotcha, guess I‚Äôll just have to get some more practice it seems like whenever I start kiting away they get a charge off and I‚Äôm far as fug

I just want to know the sauce on that Jaina art.

Ok, I'll take a stab at it.

Hunters are hunters and have always been hunters.

Mages are mages and have always been mages.  
---
The new hunters are hunters.  
---
The new mages are mages.  
---
Assholes are assholes and there are assholes everywhere. The new hunters arent mages, the new hunters are the same as the old hunters: hunters.

Assholes are the original assholes. Assholes are the new assholes.

---
Season 3 when?
---
The way i approched it was starting to get best in slot gear (before raids). I didn't want to just level, then just grind gear. Instead, i grinded gear while leveling (i.e. BRD)
---
Priests can self heal and dot. It's all about managing to kill the goblin boss and princess in Maraudon and selling the items you get.  Only classes that can dps whilst moving are able to beat princess alone.
---
&gt;And then some people will defend it too
---
Its good for them aswell.
---
barkskin has a cd and roots last for 12 sec so you'd have to root mobs twice to kill them
---
Any warlock main pvp youtubers you can recommend? I only know of Cobrak.

Wait how do you know if u/[kaboshhh](https://www.reddit.com/user/kaboshhh/) is a bro and not a sis?
---
They gave us vanilla, they can take my money again.
---
Just because you're fulfilling one role at the moment doesn't mean you don't play other roles or utilize those things while leveling.
---
I'm a shadow priest but I heal lots of dungeons.
---
Some random parking their behind in SW whispering people all over Azeroth. Not even mentioning the guild name in your pitch? Harshing my mellow, man.
---
Its a cow dog!

Yeah, it becomes a rage dump when you cap rage, if you spec it and have a swing timer. Its optimal but not "needed" I guess.
---
Check out the forums if you want to be on a PvP server, starting there now could (will) be painful if you choose the wrong side

Once every 15 minutes.

I WANT to play rogue but I know just how many there are. I ended up settling on a hunter for now because I can do a lot on my own if I want.

Rushing just takes the fun out of it and makes it feel more like a job than a game. Level 16 rogue here

What server does someone have Lionheart recipe? Can't find any here on Razorgore EU Alliance
---
Sorry to say but it's a bit more than 700g.  I leveling in the night elf zones and had to spend more gold to buy the rest of the rep.  I paid 900g for the mount and another \~400g for the runecloth.  That's not counting the runecloth I farmed myself.
---
That‚Äôs good to know. As far is leveling how does it fair? I‚Äôm only level 25 but frost is already boring me.
---
lol classic raids are easy as fuck , class 'viability' is irrellevant. pick a class you enjoy playing, if you don't enjoy playing any then play bfa. classic isn't for everyone. every guild except for the most tryhard of tryhard will take anyone whos 60 and attuned to raid, and they will easily clear up to and including naxx.
---
Any auction house application like the one we have for bfa?
---
So here's what most people don't seem to recall or know at all. There's a thing called weapon speed normalization. It means that regardless of speed, if you compare the ability damage of spells that use your weapon damage 2handed weapons will always calculate to the damage of a weapon that uses 3.3 speed. So as long as a 2h weapon has the same dps on it as another your ability damage will be the same.
---
But the axe is still better because of sweeping strikes, which duplicates your next 5 hits onto a second target. Slower weapons will have larger white hits and these stay the same with sweeping strikes. And the axe is the slowest of them, which is why it was and is seen as the best.
---
Points can also be made to say that the axe is better because of Axe Specialization in your talents but it is entirely possible to never pick one of the specialization talents, I personally didn't (as I wasn't sure what weapons I would have during leveling) and I have been just fine.
---
So my advice, if you don't care about being the fastest leveler (chances are you aren't as you're level 30 right now) just take the sword. The axe is better but not THAT much better.
---
Enchanting bags are for ENCHANTING materials only

I found this guide to be better (and not embellishing the numbers ): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMQymNHZcUk
---
Lol what bullshit on the description on the video; "clickbait title? maybe. have you seen a more ridiculous run? no."
---
I totally knew that! You didn't?! Hah! Look at this guy not knowing Dispel Magic works on Frost Nova. Who wouldn't know that? Certainly not a vanilla server-first OG raider! Heh heh. Heh.
---
Yeah, I'm moving Dispel Magic to a better hotkey now.
---
The first thing I thought was they're about to kiss
---
I find it really depends on the time of day. Late at night and early in the morning is where the toxicity and immaturity are on full display. I just quest on my low level alts during that time of day/night to avoid it as much as possible.
---
my pet peeve is hunters who think it‚Äôs okay to pull aggro and rely on feign death immediately after. they don‚Äôt realize that the time the mob is running back and forth is additional time the tank isn‚Äôt building aggro, meaning every other DPS has to hold off or risk also pulling aggro.
---
Spirit should be the main stat on my plate armor set? Or on my healing set? I am trying to find the right answer for whether it should be strength  / stamina / agility when leveling alone and healing power / intellect for healing. What does the spirit contribute ? Thanks :):)
---
Pic of time played or it didnt happen.
---
They seem to do this a lot so it's more their default state.

I had a nice little moment with an undead mage in swamp of sorrows taking on lost ones.

This is exactly what I use as my hunter

\#showtooltip Freezing Trap
---
/cast Feign Death
---
/petpassive
---
/cast Freezing Trap
---
Don't copy and paste that because Reddit format isn't the same as WoW's lol, but you can replace it with any traps you'd like. 
---
I don't know if it's because of Classic spaghetti code but there be about a one-second window where it won't let you cast Freezing Trap so you just have to sit there until it finally lights up.
---
Feel the same way about the leveling, though starting a druid I'm not any where near as familiar with their starting area as I am with Elwynn so it's a bit more slow going
---
Looking forward to the bis grind on a new class for sure! :)
---
Rouges do some things a warrior cant do.  CC is a big one warriors don't have sap.  Stun locks are also a tool warrior doesn't have.  They can open locked boxes which is nice.  Stealth is less of a deal in 5 man parties (as the rest of the party has to go through anyway) but while questing being able to pick which fights you take is a huge perk.  They can also vanish and save a run back...if there is a wipe the warrior always has to run back and pays the biggest durability tax.
---
Hahaha thank you I will do that !!! Just didn‚Äôt want to make any SUPER dumb moves like obvious bad talents but maybe there isn‚Äôt a bad bad way to play. I will be more lenient about this all !
---
When you say go gnome, what level is the max level I should get engineering to so i can start over? Do I need it at 300? Or is what I have to make like 275 or something like that?
---
Probably black mageweave set, that shit looked like lingerie on females.
---
I want to start a brd aoe group, how much time do we need to stay in each instance to not get locked out? 15 mins?
---
Edit: Also how much does the lockout last for?
---
Silithus elementals in the north but it can be crowded. Elementals in burning steppes is a decent fallback.
---
I agree. If the item is going to be used, I typically don‚Äôt have a problem with someone rolling need.
---
I like to put 100g in the tradewindow and go afk or alt+tab. One guy hung onto hope for more than 30 minutes.
---
you have a 27% chance to miss white hits on a level 63 boss, yellow special abilities have a 9% chance.
---
As auto attacks are a major part of most melee classes any point of hit over 9% is still valuable
---
Makes me want to roll a female tauren hunter tbh
---
Classic.wowhead.com
---
Sounds fair. It is hard to find someone that can make it, you are already spending a lot on it and it and it is so good that you don‚Äôt really care that it is expensive. If someone would make it for less then 100g then I would be suspicious.
---
Not yet. Maybe in a few years.
---
No nature's swiftness

Aye same to me. Went to Hillsbrad thinking STV was gna be bad. Fuck nope. Hillsbrad‚Äôs the fucken worse.

STV was like serenity compared to Hillsbrad.

Im leveling slow because of time constraints, but I haven't had to wait more than about 10 min to find a group for any dungeon I have done so far which has veen nice.

Heirloom gear. Kills it for me every time.

I'm sure most mages would love getting paid for their food.

Thank you so so much I definitely will check it out ! Definitely want to be with some other paladins to help learn! Appreciate this a lot
---
Level 1 shitpost
---
Yeah, how about a third weiner too?
---
You get 5 resets an hour so theoretically 12 minutes but if you have trash to cleave main as well go the full time.
---
This is actually a new take for me, do you feel that the feeling of reward or progression is just too slow after 60? Or is it maybe the quality of the content for you?
---
Can u please send name of all armor you have equipped? Thanks in advance!
---
https://i.imgtc.ws/P3NPlxz.png
---
Well my dwarf will be a big ol hottie
---
The "game starts at cap" mindset basically started in Wrath tbh. There was some of it in vanilla and a bit more in TBC, but it didn't start being how the game felt till wrath. Wrath was also when the nostolgia for vanilla really started as well the myth of how hard raiding was "way back then". Even though 3Drakes and Firefight are still two of the hardest fights in the game, and way harder than anything in vanilla was.
---
Goofy as ever!!! Eat ass.
---
?? Means you are at least 10 levels under them. Skull means they are 10+ levels over you
---
Auctioneer and Auctionator I think are both up and running.  TSM is pretty close as well.
---
I just cant stop thinking about what blizz could do with that original mentality of classic that the dev's had, mixed with the technical capabilities of today. Despite the many gameplay flaws BFA has atm, you can't not appreciate the art and design team and that gives me hope for new content in the future
---
Grants on the tame. I remember being excited for classic partially for things like camping this bad boy.

There are plenty of overturned bans that were wrongful bans, this case seems like blizzard were 100% sure of the ban and OP is just bullshitting trying to get it over turned

Gnomes have fun toys but sapper charges are amazing for rogues and Warriors for aoe and will always sell on the AH, especially to gnomish engineers who can‚Äôt make them.
---
But you could do what the other poster said, do gnomish and then unlearn for goblin.
---
Thanks for the in depth explanation.
---
I don't understand how locks do that your first two moves are dots that generate next to no instant aggro and as long as you stand back a bit like the healer you shouldn't be proximity pulling anything either.
---
It's a reportable offense and they'd get nothing out of it?
---
There are 2 hit caps. Yellow and white. For duelwield the white hitcap is so ridiculessly large it really shouldn't be a concern.
---
So lets talk about yellow.
---
For 305 it's 6%, for 300 it's 9%.
---
For 310 I'm not sure how the formula goes, perhaps it's 6 perhaps 5, honestly if you are playing a rogue you are never ever ever going below the yellow hitcap so it matters not.
---
Is this true? Banned?
---
Yea. One good thing about classic (and vanilla) was that you could choose more your adventures. In retail you are more an more funnelled into doing the same content if you want any sort of progression of your toon.
---
Well, outside of a raid environment you can use serpent sting.
---
It is Horde only. And i wouldnt call it a secret as it has been posted here at least 3 times already
---
I mean how is it different from advertising your professions? I can't fathom how using real life money to buy power is remotely similar to providing a service in game.
---
Huh? It is true that it is worthless for leather and cloth wearers. It binds on pickup and can only be turned in for mail or plate.
---
I'm pretty sure that intense glowing stare from the undead is "Why the fuck did you just get in this with me"
---
&gt; Good mages well always be in demand 
---
For what? Raid mages have a 1 button rotation. Dungeons people just want a balanced comp.
---
SEE YEH SOOON
---
There's nothing wrong with this, and there's a huge difference between helping and getting help, and just taking and taking and taking from others. The amount of people who think guilds are all about making other people help you (instead of also helping others) is staggering.
---
Take the call out of the post before it‚Äôs removed.
---
&gt;If you get spell locked you're basically dead because all your spells are shadow. 
---
Tbh it feels like mages cant put out so much pressure in the time of a CS to make fake casting actually worth it.
---
When I face a mage that is actually threatening I usually sac my VW and insta switch to felhunter which makes the 1v1 so one sided that I can make a shit ton of mistakes and still win because they cant get through the vw shield, extra resistance and 30% damage reduction.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that about ability normalization! That tips the favor to the sword‚Äîlike you say, the axe is better but not THAT much better. Thanks!

What about Warlocks? We have no equal.
---
Eh, aren't those the same thing? (Probably not I'm just tired af atm)

Agreed, I think the good at avoiding ganks shit was true in actual vanilla. I played a warrior and for like a year didn't know to demo shout and break stealth...

Thank you for the feedback. =)

The previous paragraph talks about more sinister training post undeath though blade familiarity game from his culinary skills and butcher roots. Unsure how to reword it and still retain the flow.

If your posting an item and you have done your scan its usually a good idea to click "refresh" on bottom left of post page.

Yes, you would be able to report that and open a ticket.

Yes, I do. Alt+PrintScreen for current window only, Windows+PrintScreen for current monitor only, Windows+Shift+S for a specific part of the screen.
---
What a goof
---
I guarantee their noob asses do way worse.
---
Give them boots with minor speed enchant
---
That is probably true.  People on my friends list are very casual and 75% or more most nights are still in classic.  I do have a few that are doing both because they like retail raiding.  I think this metric will vary greatly from person to persin and can't be used to judge anything.

Amplify magic?
---
Jfc...as if a 44 warlock isn't just as capable as a 45 mage... lmfao.
---
Thank you. I'll think on additions or perhaps other story threads if I'm inspired.
---
When you compare percentages like 9% vs 18%, that's a 100% difference. The absolute difference is a pretty meaningless number when it comes to percentages.
---
A bit of a contrived example, imagine there were many more classes in the game and one class had 1% representation and another 4%. That's 4 times as many, even though the difference is "just a few percent".
---
Good stuff. Pay no attention to the dumb comments from people who associate anything vaguely cute with being porn, that's their problem.
---
That said, I bet if you drew this with a night elf instead with the exact same pose you'd get zero comments of that kind. But being a beastrace suddenly people assume there's a filthier side to everything. Makes ya think.

"Eat ass" I mean if you say so..

---
Repost of a post I saw last night...
---
Dal Rend is not bis for hunters in phase 1 because the +15 agi enchants aren‚Äôt out
---
The list you‚Äôre looking at is bad. Peacemaker is easier to farm, better, and doesn‚Äôt take important loot from your melee dps.
---
I try and put good Karma out in Azeroth. 
---
I picked up 2 blue daggers for a rogue alt.. noticed they were MH.. so /who 20 rogue and gave one away. 
---
I passed on savage glad chain. I've passed on blackcrow as a hunter for warriors as its not quite bis for me. I've passed dal rends for rogues.. I help people with my ubrs key for free.. I really try. but after a week without a single gear upgrade and over 30 dungeons done.. the temptation to give in, and be a prick. 
---
to start doing 'LFXM but Y is reserved' is tempting. becoming the thing I hate.. 
---
I'm still waiting on that karma mind..
---
Also did the thign and helped out lowbies multiple times with quests, whirlwind.. whilst waiting for wife in brill even gave some beggars 1g each etc.. 
---
WHERE IS MY KARMA. I'm honest enough to admit I only do the nice things in the hope I get it back! but all I've been met with is jackassery
---
Are all the mages you guys play with bad or something? I ask before every dungeon if group wants me to single target or aoe. They say aoe every time. Every single time. I'm arcane frost spec with 40% and 30% threat reduction respectively. Arcane explosion spam, when I pull threat I CoC, then kite with AE, when slow wears off I nova, then AE again, then CoC again after nova breaks, followed by arcane explosion spam. It's simple, no one is even close to dying, and it's so much faster that the healer and tank tell me to keep doing it. Is the average mage really that bad?
---
I like it. Looks good:)
---
Yes, absolutely yes.
---
At least they can't take ALL the weapons, right?
---
Same for me and Stormwind :D
---
yea, I have been running into some real bad hunters lately, bums me out
---
50-60 is the most enjoyable and feels fast but in terms of hours played is the longest.
---
Lol, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm barely even replying on you but good on you for checking this dead line of comments every few minutes to see if you can be a social justice warrior for m‚Äôladies armor and pretend asking what multi shot is with it being 2019 with instant access to any information within seconds isnt fucking stupid.
---
Oh my gosh I forgot to do this. I promise when I get online tonight/tomorrow I'll edit this post w/ the answer.
---
that‚Äôs why I always recruit dps myself when I‚Äôm tanking. If anyone pulls like dumbass .. instant kick. Dps is incredibly easy to find anyway.
---
It's not free damage.  If you're missing range autos because you're inept at spacing appropriately via wingclip/strafeing and all the other tools you're given.  You sitting there raptor striking is NOT A GOOD THING it's not free damage.  It's just worse damage.
---
I highly doubt you're capable of melee weaving given your thoughts on this whole matter.  So no you aren't optimizing by "constantly meleeing" you're just bad at being a hunter.  And even worse you're a shit groupmate for screwing over your melee counterparts.
---
if you're over level 45, buy limited invulnerability potions. 6 seconds of immunity vs rogue/warrior lets you absolutely MAUL them with no trouble
---
*yawn* the circlejerk here that mages shitty is getting old. Ive grouped with a lot of mages so far and they haven't been any worse on average than the other classes.
---
Oh lemme guess you don‚Äôt jump to conclusions
---
That escalated quickly.
---
Definitely not as difficult as commenting about how easy something is you‚Äôve never done
---
People playing an MMO want interaction instead of just tackling everything themselves, go figure
---
Those people have always existed in the game. 
---
I was in a high end raiding guild back in original Vanilla and we had a guy who had just joined ninja some crappy blue item from a 5 man. We didn't run DKP and he would've gotten geared up really quickly but he was so bloody short sighted. 
---
Had to deal with a lot of folks who would 'guild hop', too. There were 3 uber guilds and folks would get just enough gear from one of them and then try to bounce to another one if they were an in demand class. We also saw a lot of leap frogging from the lower guilds who were trying to break into MC or whatever. 
---
People can be shitty, basically.
---
&gt;pls don't call out shitty people and let them continue to be toxic for other players
---
If they're going to be shitty to me, I don't want them to be shitty to anyone else.
---
Whilst you can clear MC with a PvP build, you might want to consider this: mage is the most popular dps class in the game right now. There are A LOT of mages and many of those mages have levelled very fast using AoE techniques. Competition for raid spots is fierce and one of the quickest ways to decide who to pick is to look at talents.
---
If I were you, just commit to PvE for a while then respec once you‚Äôve got some gear and your guild has MC on farm and doesn‚Äôt give a shit anymore. You can still PvP on a PvE build and kite warriors and paladins until they rage quit.
---
Harhah!
---
I mean it was a secret; until it was publicized. Just play the damn game... SMH
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt you start with an auto attack? I usually do Serpent - auto  - multi - auto - aimed - repeat multi and auto.
---
With a slow weapon you don‚Äôt lose out on autos during aimed cast time. I think with this rotation the CDs between multi and aimed line up really good.
---
Shadow bolt spam
---
Unfortunately I didn't think, at the time, to create a historical document outlining the situation. I just grabbed a funny screenshot to show my friends and one of them suggested I share it on reddit.
---
ZT alliance, Loue from Praxis has one. I think it dropped on their first rag kill, the lucky bastards.
---
He charged 100g, which is pretty reasonable considering.
---
And to be fair playing a hunter it's much easier to mess things up than other classes. If you literally left click to just select a mob and not even cast anything, your character shoots at it with auto attack. If you multishot you have zero control of where your arrows fly and multishot is a large part of your DPS so it's not like you can just not multishot if you're trying to DPS hard.
---
Also you're not able to stand close to enemies so if another DPS pulls threat and the mob runs towards you, you now have to move yourself to a different position unlike every other ranged class. So you're the only class that has to find new positioning which leads to pulling extra mobs.
---
Hah agreed. There were so many times while questing I felt like I was cheating. Kiting tough spawns, drawing aggro with pet to grab q items then running away til it despawns, sending pet up a hill to grab mobs and bring them over to you to avoid walking.
---
When were Trolls given access to Druid? Kinda broke my heart to see I won't be able to recreate my main in classic, but I'm down for Shaman. I just seem to remember Trolls always having Druid as a playable class.
---
He's saying that it's funny the way in which I called out the hunter by providing proof of his lies.
---
STV is ridiculously bad. 25 kills with no drops is insanely bad luck also..
---
They literally aren't though for aoe? Mages do way more damage more efficiently
---
Fellow herbolgist here, level 41 with 28 gold and no mount. The herb market on my server is so bad I can buy stuff off the AH and sell it to vendors for a profit of a few coppers.
---
As a horde thankfully i didn't have such experience so far... Everyone is nice ppl help groups even when they finish their quests
---
Reposting the same thing that has been posted every day since release. You sir are a saint!
---
I rolled hunter as my first alt and the depth in pets is overwhelming me. I wanted a bear cause i thought he looked neat, but after some research it looks like he can only get taunt bite and maul(or claw or something) im currently lvl 30 and the bear was tamed at 11 in silverpine. His claw skill is rank 2. Will the ability keep leveling as we go on or do i have to tame a bigger level pet with claw to obtain a higher rank for my og.
---
Decided i dont rly feel like midmaxing too much (hence my hunter is a tauren lol) but im curious about how big of a difference it would be in damage if i was using some lvl 30 kitty instead of me trusty ol' bear. From what i gathered hes supposed to be a decent tank pet but i always pull aggro after a few autos. Idk if i could be doing something different. Higher rank of taunt for more threat maybe? At a loss here.
---
Really? I haven't gotten that far yet and was just guessing from vanilla. My bad
---
I constantly got praised for being able to control my pet in SM.
---
Makes me feel so good.
---
I didn't start hitting double digits on gold until my 30s, as a warrior.
---
Grunts who boast about their service in barrens chat deserve to get told off. Barrens chat is not a hugbox
---

---
I‚Äôm laughing at how this turned from about the context of the picture to how the picture was taken
---
Gave me a chuckle
---
Yeah dude, reading through this thread the mages these guys are playing with must be absolute garbage. Aoe pull, I arcane explosion till I pull threat, then CoC, then kite with Arcane Explosion, then Nova when slow wears off, then arcane explosion, then CoC after Nova breaks, followed by arcane explosion. Can easily deal with massive groups as the only mage. Then you gotta love the mages who are just like only frostbolting without weaving in fire blast, CoC, then Arcane Explosion, with that priority.
---
You‚Äôre only more efficient if you‚Äôre actually in a group farming. Spamming general or LFG for two hours wasn‚Äôt more efficient than just taking the warlock, in this case.
---
buy limited invulnerability potions. thank me later
---
100% agree. Almost every dungeon wipe I've been in lately is some rookie mage hopped up on whatever he just saw a professional gamer do on Twitch who thinks he can run in circles, rounding up elite mobs 3-5 levels above him and burn them all down with one blizzard. Then, when he dies, we all have to hear his surprised Pikachu face whine about how the tank didn't instantly get aggro on all 20 mobs at once or how the healer couldn't drop half a dozen instant, full heals on him over the course of a few seconds.
---
I'm druid. Dont wanna hear it lol. 3 different specs each level is like 2 skills in all three specs
---
I literally almost did that but I figured I spent enough time on a shitpost lol
---
You're right, you can't. I posted the current fight stats shortly after (because the hunter made the same point, at the time), and it also had multi shot in it. I just didn't grab that part in a screenshot.
---
And then there's my guild. I'm rolling in dough asking if anyone needs money for their mount and they just say nah I'd rather Walk. Like what compels you to do this stuff? Anyone wants this awesome item for vendor price?  They refuse cuz they need to save their money for a mount. You literally lose no money and become stronger. Why can't you let me help you („Éé‡≤†Áõä‡≤†)„ÉéÂΩ°‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
---
Fun fact 44 is halfway to 60 xp wise if anyone wondered :)
---
If you need 5 seconds every pull during low level dungeons you aren't a good tank.
---
So you know how others feel about rushing to 60.. interesting.
---
Guys, seriously though, which one should I pick as main companion?
---
i did a similar thing on light leather..bought about 200 for 80 silver and it was great
---
Trolls could be Druid‚Äôs starting in cata
---
priests = just spam fear, use felhunter silence/death coil to outlast will of the forsaken then just lock them back up into fears and let them slowly rot to dots, if you have the space to drain them then you can even drain mana while they are feared so that you dont break the fear with damage + they're even more fucked if they live through the fears
---
&gt; Classic feels like rock, paper, scissors.
---
[A classic right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX1dPTAQ5_U)
---
Yeah, double upside as you get to choose the composition of the group.  As a warrior I don't want to bring warrior dps along, I'm specced arms just like he is he can go tank his own group and I get dibs on all the mail/plate or 2h if I leave out pallies also.
---
But every weapon isn't a mage weapon like they are for hunters.
---
Why I rolled lock for an alt
---
It definitely isn't, I agree. Many damage dealers have no concept of threat levels and how they work. If any novice DDs are reading this; let the tank get a few hits in before attacking, please.
---

---
What professions?
---
Just do dungeons. I've ran a couple of RFD and got like 20 gold from selling greens.
---
Really wholesome drawing! I used to main a hunter back in vanilla and the pets always had a special place in my heart :) Playing a druid now and always make sure to take good care of hunters pets :)
---
It hurt to read this dumbass reply.
---
Yeah i changed the title to something that made sense.
---
Replacing DPS is very, very, easy. Tank not as easy
---
Yeah it‚Äôs nice to be on the other side of the ‚Äúpeople who play that class suck‚Äù jokes for once
---
Because karma points
---
It's not significant. If you have 2 or 3 mages for their ice snare thing, a lock can stay really close in terms of damage.
---
Haha, well there ya go
---
With a name like Combyobeard, I'm not surprised
---
Neat! I only saw this guy for the first time today, with three level 21 locks in the Gadgetzan inn. I had no idea it was free.
---
Ah ok.
---
It's really a issue most of the time. A bubble or heal to keep em healthy while the tank taunts back. Obviously if things get crazy I start playing triage, but yeah
---
Even warlocks dont get to use their dots in raids  maybe you are allowerd to use corruption if you are lucky and sm/ruin
---
It's cool my dude, I usually am that guy myself. :p
---
Health regen items are pretty much all useless.
---
Damn you got these cheap! I would pick either red or emerald but probably emerald.
---
I entirely forgot that quivers were a thing you could see.  When I started shooting mobs I was surprised to see it.  It would be nice if they weren't all white and had their own looks.
---
What is this referring to?
---
they shouldn't be starting that till they have their 3 dots up, that,s a solid 3-5 seconds which should be more than enough time for the tank to get a few sunders in and have aggro, and how hard is it to pace yourself? DPS isn't a race outside a few specific fights where timing matters.
---
Herbalism and Tailoring
---
Very much so but the reason me and my friends got into Classic was very much the community aspect of it. We enjoy being part of a group of friends who aren't looking to exploit but instead help each other without expectations of rewards. 
---
So far everything is peachy outside of a creeping suspicion two particular guildies are going to cause loot drama. One dude was essentially begging the GM and Healer (as a Spriest) to let him have the first Benediction drop.. We have like 5 people at 60 haha..
---
Between my RL friends and the GM's friends we have 20 people out of a 40 man raid, so that's pretty cool.
---
Yeah but Blizz has said that Medium Pop is equivalent to what a ‚Äúfull‚Äù vanilla server was, and even low pop is still equal to a few thousand people.
---
Could be a possibility that an add-on is causing the problem, enable the one at a time and see if the issues still happens
---
That thing about claiming territories actually sounds like it could be fun..
---
That is what a mother is for, not a wife or any form of romantik partner. Rarely if ever are theese relationships happy.

No need to be a douche. I‚Äôve tried for world/server first before.

You won't get gear for the opposite faction. That was a bug introduced in the TBC pre-patch.
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
I can tell if a rogues CDs are up by whether he's running away from me or not.

Okay maybe I shouldn't complain. I was selling briarthorn for 1g a stack and it's down to 75s. 
---
I'm stockpiling swifthistle for phase 3.

No, but you need to find a blacksmith to apply the spurs to your boots via the trade window.

You too low for tortoises on shore of tanaris? :) Skin for thick to sell and vendor their Grey's for decent too
---
Your memory is very faulty, you're thinking of [Thrill of the Hunt](https://tbcdb.com/?spell=34499) which is a TBC survival talent.
---
You need to hug the left wall down that passage.  The mobs down low are the ones that will pull aggro and they have to run all the way to the top pulling every other mob in that lower middle part on the way to get up on that left side with you.  If everyone is at least 28, hug the left wall the whole way down, fight on the left wall.
---
Yes it is. most groups arent aoe groups.
---
&gt; What server? I'm not quite sure what server would suite me best. I enjoy PvP, the occaisonal RP shenanigans and so on.
---
Some other factors to consider:
---
* Timezone; in the US, you have servers that go by EST and PDT timezones; I don't know if people really pick a server based on this nowadays though?
---
* Latency; in the US, EST-timezone servers are using Chicago for the datacenter; PDT servers LA
---
* Population; now is one of the more ideal times to get a good grasp as to what servers are popular
---
They do resist sometimes. Went to Library a couple of times when i was lvl 40 and I'd say on average they resist once per run. Then you vanish and continue :)
---
It's better to go through Thousand Needles as alliance, that way you get the flight point that's at the edge of 1k needles and Feralas.
---
pretty much, except at least those people do the dungeon themselves.
---
Yes! I just setup a filter to look for any uncommon, rare or epic weapons rewarded from quests but I recommend refining it a bit more, especially by level: https://classic.wowhead.com/weapons/quality:2:3:4/slot:21:22:13:15:25:17?filter=18;1;0
---
I'm 60 already with pre-raid bis mixed with some raid gear. And apart from some of our first raids, the best memories I have are from leveling. I honestly miss that.
---
Realistically, at your hip.  While back quivers look cool as fuck, they're very impractical for actual use.
---
Source: I use a back quiver and it's awkward, but I still insist on using mine because it was a gift and it looks cool.
---
That doesn't really have anything to do with what you said above. A less efficient group is better than no group, but a warlock isn't "just as capable" as a mage.
---
Can guarantee you‚Äôre not playing on the classic settings. You‚Äôre more than likely playing on the games higher settings.
---
its incredibly useless. but i love it

Like the 12 people who had measles, an easy to cure illness? Be programmed by pharmaceutical companies harder, sheep. Hilarious how doctor's can say weed is not good for you and you all freak out but they say vaccines good because that's how they get paid, and you all jump on the bandwagon of shitting on those who don't want to inject new borns with Mercury and other heavy metals.
---
Thank you, and RIGHT?? I was thinking the same thing! Like no one would look twice if it was a dwarf or nelf hunter.
---
Where does it state that?  
---
The only thing AHDB does when you are not at the AH is put AH prices in item tooltips.
---
Lost the roll to a resto shaman earlier today.
---
Ez pez, have your friends help you, I made it to 225 at level 28, got to level up to 35 to get artisan tailoring. Which kind of sucks as I am pretty bored of leveling at this point. Was great fun back in '05, now it seem I don't have the same enthusiasm.
---
Engineering is great for hunters. Good ammo is a plus
---
A link would be nice, for those of us afflicted
---
OH I totally got that. But some people, you know
---
. Just eat everything up at face value.
---
ye ill fix it, different sources say that hes not only fire elemental but also an old god but cant confirm 100% so ill fix the question
---
you dont sound especially nice yourself
---
Big doubt that the old enchant system will be used for ZG enchants. I would bet money that Blizzard goes with the 1.12 version, where only the Primal Hakkari Idol is needed for the enchant but only 2 idols drop per raid.
---
Still need the bloods for DM enchants though if you want em.
---
Oh shoot you got told by Jeff Kaplan.
---
Oh shit engineering makes ammo? I'll have to go with that then. If I want to use a bow does engineering cover that?
---
Thank you for spreading correct information. If I see one more moron try to explain how Dal Rends is Hunter BIS without knowing WHY shows a complete lack of understanding of the game and enchants.
---
That‚Äôs ok, karma is often right around the corner.
---
Was helping some friends kill elementals in arathi, when someone asked for help in dabyrie farmstead, got killed by a rogue and a pally. Wandered over with my 50 hunter, pet and viper sting made short work of the pally, nearly wiped the rogue out with some lucky crits. They popped vanish, and I waited for the inevitable stun-lock. It came, my pet went beast mode and that‚Äôs all she wrote.
---
Just remember, whilst it might feel good, there‚Äôs someone inevitably bigger and scarier around the corner who will teach you to be humble...
---
At that point of letting the void take years to establish threat, it has already lost so much ho it negates any useful efficient Mob killing power. Might as well burst shit down with succubus.
---
Also chill the fuck out.
---
Wow dude you're lucky, every time when someone ganks me, he was just passing by and I don't get any chance for revenge :d
---
It only drops off of Dire Maul mobs. Safe to say it won't drop until DM opens up.
---
IIRC stuff like Briarthorn and Kingsblood is dirt cheap on my server, but Sungrass sells well and is very common in Feralas and Hinterlands (bit better in Feralas along with Goldthorn and the occasional Purple Lotus).
---
Nice one
---
What is the slowest you want to go for a tanking weapon?
---
i would love to see his face irl after that. i know i would just be like wtf just happened and sit there for a few minutes without releasing.
---
Two dudes, chillin in a hot tub
---
Quests and mobs start giving a lot more currency 40+. I couldn't get my mount until 42. But I did sort of hustle on the AH.
---
It was posted today earlier as well.
---
Bahaha that mage, poor naive lad.
---
Rolling for gear on my rogue has become VERY frustrating against all these hunters. On the other hand, tanking when there are mages in the group is also up there.
---
I can recommend "Character Notes". You can have the note show up in their tooltip, when you /who them or when they join your group.
---
I personally am doing skinning X mining on my hunter because im poor. Will probably drop skinning for Eng later
---
Welp. Looks like he has to delete his character now
---
Bow chicka lok'tar!
---
Pre raid bis for a priest has like no stamina. 
---
Get some necropoile gear.
---
Warriors are your hard counter.  Welcome to classic. 
---
Hunters you have to pillar jump or live in their dead zone and kill them with dots.
---
Wait... Are you 1v1ing or in a party
---
At the end of the day it's all about exp. Gotta work with what you got. That's like comparing hands in poker and folding if you get anything less than a full house.
---
Dude. I fucking hate anything to turn in there. On pserver you‚Äôre definitely going to run into someone doing it. Ruined me
---
LMAO WHAT A REBEL!!!
---
Did not say I was. I'm playing on "6".
---
it shouldn't take two hours to get mages, as they are one of the most common classes, though. Getting a good group and grinding for hours is definitely superior to getting a half-assed group and having to fall apart
---
And deathcoils and fears !Best protection to a warlock is another warlock
---
I find crafting professions can be fun, so I didnt know which one meshed better with hunter for levelling
---
How does that help the underdogs on those servers?
---
FEEL THE BERN
---
Yeah, it is pretty annoying as a mage main, giving other mages a bad name.
---
I planned on being an asshole once I hit level 60, charging for portals and what not, but there are just plenty stupid mages now. I think I'll chill out in darnassus and give free ports to new players  instead.
---
I think he was referring to
---
&gt;If you are a good player people will bring your to raids regardless of the spec/class.
---
which is definitely a good joke.
---
Classic graphics settings are on 3. That would be why it looks so good now.
---
Fair enough, happens to the best of us!
---
Lok'thar, friend.
---
Disc is an excellent support tree. For killing anything, it's slow and not optimal. Hunters are built to kill and cc things at Max range and warriors are built to smash things. Try shadow if you want to focus wpvp tbh. Of course, having a warrior buddy smash things for you is a great idea.
---
I dabbled a bit as a Death Knight tank in WotLK, and even smaller as a warrior. Druid tanking is new to me, only thing... blizz doesnt say on bears what henerates bonus threat! Its all over warrior skill descriptions!
---
If you like know the numbers or even basics behind stuff, I found this great threat-explained guide on the classic druid discord. Hope it helps! 
---
(In short bear form gets 30% more threat like warrior defensive stance, then maul abd swipe get large, scaling damage to threat buffs.) Tiny bit more, but thats big ideas I took! Thorns and ret aura seem to help me quite a bit too.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of extra room in that tub.
---
Yeah rogues are just hella squishy at low levels, the more cooldowns/utility/cc‚Äôs you get as you level the easier it gets. One thing to bear in mind with rogue too is that they‚Äôre very cool down and utility based, if you try to just facetank mobs and expect to smack them down every time then it‚Äôs going to feel like a real struggle. At 22 you get vanish and that will help, but the reason is because it gives you more tools to get around harder mobs or if you pull multiple mobs. Rogues can be really great levelers you just have to understand the mindset behind them and how to use your cooldowns consistently and timely to increase your survivability. You‚Äôll learn what fights to avoid, and how to weave in and out of combat as needed. Stealth throws a big mechanic into rogue gameplay, and while combat spec is the least stealth dependent, don‚Äôt forget that you are in leather armor and are a silent Assassin, not a dual wielding berserker

I actually did my first run there Thursday, we got through it in around 2 and half hours with 4 people who'd never done it and one guy who kinda knew where to go.
---
I like to tell them to bring me 5 of an item normally unavailable in the auction house. Those kids nowadays are lazy though and don't even want to work for their money.
---
As a tank I've had so many warlocks dot up immediately, and then their first shadow bolt crits, and thats usually enough to take aggro. Then my taunt gets resisted and I'm a sad boy
---
I'm doing engineering mining on my hunter and the bombs you can make after 150 are actually super useful and the craftable goggles are great for before you can get a helmet through normal means. It is a bit of a money sink, though. Herb/alch was much easier to level by comparison.
---
So brave.

I think as we go past the initial waves of people leveling in unison it will become so much harder to find groups.  I‚Äôm not saying that group finder is the solution though.  But finding groups did become a challenge in some realms.  I played in a realm that started high pop but dwindled to a ghost town.
---
Also the ever increasing level cap does make lacking alts a pain.  Again, not saying these are the solutions.  
---
Classic wow doesn‚Äôt have these same kinds of problems appearing now because of the large number of players all leveling together.  It has been great!!!  But I do wonder how it will pan out over time.  For now really enjoying my time though.
---
Based on the number of times I join a group looking for a tank only to realize a warrior invited me (a druid) I'd say, no, it is not mages, but warriors, who are the new hunters.
---
Yeah I see why you guys are defensive about the rp aspect I came to Zand for a lore friendly server. And what I had been told/seen online was that the rp pvp servers were more mature and more about the fun of the game rather than the try hard min maxing. With the caveat of
---
Respect Rp, and abide by the rp rules. 
---
Which I am doing, but I see a endless amount of none rp named characters running around which I think is quite sad because as I was trying to say above I really enjoy seeing the rp when it's around me.

Is the European billing support open on Sundays? Has anyone had similar problems as follows? My recurring subscription was supposed to rebill a few days ago which it didn't, account has shown 'inactive' since but the system has let me play normally on Classic. Just moments ago it booted me off the live servers and adding more game time doesn't actually do so regardless of the system charging my bank successfully, multiple times now.
---
u/Araxom sent you a chat message regarding this, sorry I know it's weekend..
---
those are player channels, so... there is no difference, just other administrators
---
heh, this guy actually thinks that a female would make a name referencing the female breast? females are much more delicate creatures like that and would never lower themselves to such crass humor
---
It‚Äôs always disheartening to get someone in the guild who‚Äôs friendly and talkative to see they‚Äôre gone next time you log in. But this guy‚Äôs exactly right, if they don‚Äôt show signs of validation like helping out other people or showing that they wanna be there, don‚Äôt expect them to stay.
---
Not layering tho
---
&gt;because people whined and complained on the forums
---
You're delusional if you think Blizzard gives a single toss what anyone writes on the forums. They have their metrics on measuring player-satisfaction etc. and occasionally they will make decisions with that data in mind. But absolutely no team is sitting there, parsing through forum posts to figure out how they should change the game.
---
There are entire teams dedicated to developing strategies and systems for the game, player interaction and so on.
---
huntard was also just needing everything and anything
---
He's an elemental lord that lost to the old gods and was enslaved by them. 
---
&gt;When the entities known as the Old Gods arrived from the Great Dark and established their empire, the Elemental Lords saw the invaders as a threat to their dominion. For the first time in Azeroth's history, the native spirits of the world worked together against a common enemy. Ragnaros' fiery servants joined with Al'Akir the Windlord's tempests, creating blistering firestorms and cyclones of flame that reduced the Old Gods' citadels to ash. Eventually, however, the elementals of the world could not stand against the endless swarms of n'raqi and aqir, and were all enslaved.

Other than that a nice quiz.

Being a mage myself I agree with /u/peachezMcPeachez. Most mages know how to sheep since mages are forced to learn how to sheep in their early 20s otherwise they would die constantly while leveling. I usually try to CC in dungeons but some idiot almost always attacks the sheep in one way or another. Even when it is marked I find a dot on the sheep for some stupid reason.
---
Got fed up with this and eventually just stopped trying, only doing CC when shit hits the fan.
---
Get the Ashbringer from Naxx and they will hate you when you have it equipped.
---
Nostalrius wasnt the first or only private server avaliable though. theres been vanilla servers since wotlk days. Its been nothing but pure arrogance that had blizz refuse to make official vanilla servers and it took them hemorrhaging money through their other games that made them finally cave in because theyre desperate.
---
I'd watch this cartoon
---
Like they said, 4 of those green quests are outside I believe.  Getting the 4 pots or whatever, collecting the dentrium and whatever the other one is power stones, the tablet of ryun and the dudes treasure chest.  You will also find the necklace killing random things outside. 
---
Necklace guide to only run uldaman one time basically for all quests:
---
 The necklace sends you to IF to talk to tdk by the mage area. Then go inside uldaman talk to the dead pally by the first trog boss guy and you need the 3 gems. One back in the dwarf room in a vase where the medallion for the staff was.  One in the fire dwarf area later in the chest, 2 non elites spawn when you open the chest.  The third one drops off other trogg boss.  After getting it use the scrying thingy to contact the pally, now you need the stone that the final boss drops to finish the quest.
---
Hope that helps to keep this place fpp a one time run to clear every quest in the future.  I hate that place, not enough drops for most classes to make it worthwhile for more than an experience run knocking out quests.
---
A lot of them are tourists, although I would advise you report the worst offenders, you are literally supposed to as RP servers have extra in game rules, besides layering keeps us fragmented so a proper RP structure/culture can‚Äôt happen until it‚Äôs gone (in phase 2 hopefully it won‚Äôt be too far away).
---
I was thinking I‚Äôm just completely terrible and have no clue what I‚Äôm doing but their damage is actually insane. If the hunter gets the jump on you though you‚Äôre basically dead; forever kited. Thanks for the gear tip though :)
---
You try FD trap in pvp? That‚Äôs where it shows

Wait, why didn't he just grind the required 5 gold instead of getting a loan from Cosa Nostra?
---

---
Which one is player's custom channel? LFG?
---
Druids and warlocks were unlocked for trolls in cata
---
You joined the alliance, that is your reason.
---
I mean, I agree with you, but I get bombarded with requests to aoe grind every time i log in. It's weird. There are a lotta mages but not THAT many mages (for 3+ a group at all hours). I think that's the issue.
---
Some people just wants to get stuff off of their chest. They sometimes choose unconventional places like a dungeon-party-chat, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be civil about it. 
---
I don't mean to be a dick, but what if he sees this post? What would you actually have achieved other than just chasing karma-points on here? What if, you posting this, actually made another human being feel worse about something?
---
Perhaps the risk of that is low, but still, it's still a risk and people going through rough periods should be met with respect - even in "anonymous" forms as it is in WoW.
---
Hey the other guy was right, leatrix has the same layout as this addon, but doesn't 'break'. I started using it and it's great.
---
Not even damage from lava breaks the fear damn didn't know that.
---
Just in general, farming Devilsaurs in un‚Äôgoro I encounter so many warriors and hunters and get owned every single time, there‚Äôs no match a 1.1k shield (spec‚Äôd into the extra shield absorb) it just gets deleted basically
---
&gt;I want something where the reward is actually good
---
There is nothing like that in Classic, outside of "rewards" you make for yourself. Maybe if you consider getting the T0 set for its looks (since the stats are so bad, no class uses T0 for anything) or some other self-set goal.
---
Still a bit new so just flailing around swords at mach speed is about all my monkey brain can handle.
---
I did something similar, asked in /1 if anyone wanted to group up and kill some horde for fun. 
---
Some guy almost instantly replies ‚Äúwow who knew this was a pvp realm, maybe if ur getting ganked so bad you should go back to retail instead of complaining to everyone in chat like a retard‚Äù. /ignored and continued on with my day.
---
Week later I‚Äôm at 60, joined a pug as offtank and guess who joins? None other than *that guy*. I whispered the raid leader (who I grouped with a lot while levelling) and got him kicked within like 30 seconds lol. Sucks to suck.
---
What spells should I never use?
---
Eve online has caused me to essentially think 99% of people in any game are just out to fuck you over, it's a shame it happened but thankfully it only cost you a bit of time and some runecloth
---
Keep in mind that sticking with a piece of gear for 10 levels is not uncommon in Classic. Gear upgrades haven‚Äôt got a massive impact on performance and sometimes that rare you got at a lower level will be the better choice than all the greens you loot.
---
I had my main weapon for 20 levels, from 20 (Staff of Westfall) to 40 (a random green BoE with much more intellect).
---
He told Called someone a noob for asking where mankirks wife was. Needless to say he had a rough time
---
Kirtonos does not have a nice balance between faction, it's a massive horde server
---
I did that last night. I ran WC and then wasnt running dungeons until SM arm and cath kast night
---
Im located closest to the EST servers, so preferably something from that area. NA, of course, should have mentioned that before. Usually i get on daily around 7:30 pm CT.
---
It's a much better idea to do this on an alt that you never plan to raid with. Or being a creative person, you could find a way to RP antagonism with the AD and not compromise your ability to raid Naxx. Maybe they hate you, but are willing to overlook that because you share a common enemy in the scourge.
---
On the other hand they do have the necessary toxic attitude
---
Stop rushing, ffs. I haven't even installed the game yet!
---
How do I make my UI look like that ? Especially the abilities icons look rly nice.
---
Both actually.
---
/4. is official Looking for group channel, but it is zone wide, that's why you have those two, so you can quest and lfg at the same time.
---

Yeah and this time it was me. The druid was flaged for pvp. I can only assume he recently murdered a fellow country men of mine.
---
All the people telling you they've tanked viably aren't lying, but they're not mentioning that your healer will notice, especially if you tank without a shield. I've healed through some runs with 2hand tanks who'd drop to sub 50% within a second of their charge into a pack, which is not pleasant for a healer. I'm sure that just because they didn't die, they thought their tanking was viable, but it came at the expense of me potting and sweating to keep up with the damage they were taking. 
---
Just be aware that you're squishier and be ready to give your healer some more time to drink when he needs it.
---
Got it. Did more research and I am indeed wrong. Thanks mang.
---
I'm a rogue main and personally I feel like Rogues dont feel "right" until 50+. Having rank 2 kidney shot, rank 2 slice and dice, and are able to fill out either sub or combat AND get Relentless Strikes makes a huge difference in the way the class feels. Before that it feels awful IMO.
---
Yuuuuuuuup
---
I always believed that the Warcraft games should have been the only source of new story and that World of Warcraft should have been exclusively exploring, well, the *World* of Warcraft.
---
The moment WoW became the primary focus of plot development is the moment the entire franchise went to shit---The lore, the themes, the characters, the narrative, the world, the gameplay, everything.
---
The player characters in WoW should always be random nameless schmucks exploring the aftermath of the events of the Warcraft games.

I think I‚Äôd lose just as quickly, bubble doesn‚Äôt absorb an exponential amount right now and I definitely need a better set for pvp at least. Maybe I‚Äôm too used to retail and shocked that 1 person can kill me so easily
---
Except that RP servers are a safe haven not a gated communities. RP is encouraged and defended, not required. If you argue that non-rpers have every other server; then the counter is that anyone who is caught rping should be forced to move off "normie" servers. And then we get into this whole eye for an eye thing. 
---
The best we can do is provide a safe place while defending it from obvious griefers and trolls. Without gating an already small portion of the community.
---
This is the entire internet chat in 1 picture.  It‚Äôs art.
---
That no rage/aggro black hole is my personal hell. 
---
 It's like,  I'm here to do one job, just let me do it.
---
 Another thing I'm noticing as I'm tanking my way up is that even if the run starts off smooth (because I've done my introductory macro with "Hey, I'm your tank for this run! Please make sure you let your fat little tank get aggro before you go yeehaw!" as we start) folks will start to relax and get back into the retail mindset of "He looked at the mob, time to blizzard/rain of fire my guts out!". I'm sure it's probably due to the run going/looking smooth and easy but, as a tank, I assure you that we're working really hard to make it effortless for you guys.
---
I can‚Äôt get the epic mount???? Level 53 lock here and this would be very disappointing if true
---
Just watched the movies^^ Thanks for information
---
I mean they can be the most sought after dps but that's like being the tallest dwarf when there are 30,000 other dwarves also your height. Getting a non-spellcleave group as a mage takes me, on average, 90 minutes. That's spamming world and LFG looking for multiple runs. Tying any benefit of being a mage to anyone but yourself is asking for disappointment, because I'm not sure if you noticed by also reading this thread, a *lot* of people out there do not like mages, and it will affect you. I love portals, I love making my own water (sometimes), I like having Ice Barrier for running through shit on my mount, but thus far it hasn't been worth the vitriol that I get in response. Mage's strongest point right now, to me, is that playing my druid &lt;20 is miserable.
---
Dunno I'm just a mana pool that shoots sparkly light to make people feel better.
---
No this validates the "idiots will be idiots" saying. You'll find them everywhere in classic, often as mages in my experience, since so many are rolling that.
---
Mostly everything is dirt cheap on my server though about goldthorn and purple lotus. Im past using those for leveling alch so maybe Ill make some money selling those.
---
!Remindme 2 days
---
Do quest chains that lead into dungeon quests, get carried through dungeons. Also, depending on class, give yourself awesome gear and just mob grind.

---
Tier 1 honestly isnt really that good for anything. Tier 2 is judgement yeah. It's got a good mix of everything youd want for pvp. Not really that good for raiding though which is why you still need to manage 2 gear sets
---
I guarantee paladins are the best AoE tanks for 5man dungeons currently. It's not even close. You just need to sit down and ask about the mechanics and practice holding aoe threat with a buddy.
---
Thats where ur str and stam gear can come in.
---
The only spec that is average atm is Ret. Its only use is for leveling. But being average isnt necessarily bad.
---
Just know we shine for single target healing, and aoe tanking.
---

---
I love the Fairbanks server, high pop and the queue has only been like maybe 100 now then I log in, I recommend it if you want a pvp server
---
Healers will get wrecked more often than not because there is no resilience stat in the game yet.
---
If you‚Äôre new to wow rogue is going to be a lot to take in at first, but trust me get him past level 30 and if you haven‚Äôt already you‚Äôll fall in love. They‚Äôre a little bit of a challenge to get used to and adjust your play style around, but rogue was the first class I ever played back in BC and I mained it all the way through cata and am leveling a rogue alt in classic. I struggled a lot at first too but once you get the mechanics down and start using your cooldowns all the time, rogue is IMO the most fun class to play, and is very good. Don‚Äôt get discouraged because of the low level experience, it will get much much better.
---
*Especially* replacing a mage.
---
For 1v1 you‚Äôre better off as shadow.  Disc is a support spec.  Also if it‚Äôs preraid BiS you‚Äôre missing a lot of potential stam in exchange for healing.
---
If you paired up with another class, you guys would be unstoppable.
---
Oof was hoping they would flush out earlier because im trying to find a class i enjoy. So far been playing mostly hunter because i was told its one on the easiest classes to play for noobies so while i make money playing that i wanted to find out what class i wanted to be my real main. Combast rouge and arms warrior looked by far to be the closest to what i normally enjoy in mmos.

What I meant by good is like spells, your mount, or even hitting max. Something you need. But that is a good way to put it. my main goal is to hit 60 and get my mount.

That did the trick! Thank you so much for the help! I really appreciate it.

Yeah i just learner slice and dicr while leveling is not great so ill stick to sinister and eviserate. I know now also that 14-17 felt so bad because my main hand was a fast hitting wep rather than a slow hard hitting one (didnt understand fully how sinister strike worked). Its getting BETTER but so far still feels rough to play.

My current character is 14 and has 6 gold. I've been trying to sell and spend wisely.

To this subreddit, the tank can never be in the wrong. Ive seen so many tanks tab sundering everything but what they mark as skull

It doesn't work. Crusader procs on weapon hit, not melee attack.
---
Lol wow. Animal
---
Skipping any boss is retail like behavior and very casual. You should have told them when you play vanilla you gotta eat the whole scoop.
---
Also everything I‚Äôve mentioned, you‚Äôll learn along the way while leveling, just google some basic tips and practice using everything in your toolkit, rogues have the largest toolkit of utilities, and a skilled rogue can easily handle just about every other class, a skilled rogue against anyone who doesn‚Äôt know their class well enough is basically a guaranteed win. Edit: trust me, it feels rough now but before long you‚Äôll feel like a vicious killing machine
---
Haha nice joke
---
Unless you stopped mid dungeon to post this, i really doubt thats true.

It's common courtesy to only need on off-specs if the main-specs don't need it either.

You can do that?

WPvP is a whole different ballgame as well. If you're caught off guard, the chances of you winning the fight are drastically reduced. I don't know first-hand, but I've heard spriests can nuke people in pvp... I would look into it if you're not enjoying disc.
---
Thank you, I was hoping something was out there and that someone would be awesome and let me know.
---
I certainly hope so and have heard from others that it should be since it existed prior to 1.12 but no word from blizzard on the matter yet.
---
Didn't notice any bad info, any items in particular? I can check on my server to see if its similar.

I should not have chuckled, but I did.
---
As long as I don‚Äôt have to rename my mage allahu akboom as he blows himself and everything around him to pieces!

I don't care whether it 'should' stay or not. It is staying because it's Blizzard's best approximation for how spells worked in Vanilla.

&gt; Since we first announced World of Warcraft Classic, we‚Äôve seen questions about spell batching. While we never really eliminated spell batching in WoW, we did change how (and how often) we process batches of actions coming from players, so you‚Äôre less likely to notice that processing in today‚Äôs game. We‚Äôve been working to ensure that in WoW Classic, the gameplay of activating spells and effects will not differ from the experience of playing original WoW.
---
&gt; It was relatively common in the original game to see a warrior Pummel a mage who simultaneously and successfully Polymorphed the warrior. The mage suffered Pummel damage but no spell-school lock, because the mage didn‚Äôt get interrupted. This could seem paradoxical, but it could happen because the Pummel and Polymorph were both in the same batch, and were both valid actions at the start of the batch. For the most part, things like that don‚Äôt happen in modern WoW, but they still can. We‚Äôve made improvements to batch frequency, and the game is much more responsive than it used to be. Still, if you manage to get both a Pummel and a Polymorph into a tiny processing window in modern WoW, you‚Äôll experience the same behavior as in original WoW.
---
&gt; As with many other areas of WoW Classic, authenticity is our primary concern. It used to be the norm that combat flow and PvP balance were defined and tuned in a game where spell messages were resolved less frequently. There was a single game loop that processed all messages sent and received every server tick. Nowadays, the game processes multiple loops for messages of differing priorities. Spell casts are high priority, and have been for a long time.
---
&gt; For WoW Classic, we‚Äôre moving spell casts to a low-priority loop that will cause them to be processed at the frequency that best fits how the game actually played in version 1.12. Two mages will be able to Polymorph each other somewhat reliably, resulting in two sheep nervously pacing around at range. Two warriors will be able to Charge one another, and the end result will be both warriors standing stunned in each other‚Äôs original location.
---
&gt; We think it‚Äôll be fun to see those sorts of things happening again.

On Hydraxian Waterlords I feel like it's Priests. There are so many Dwarf Priests around, I swear they all rolled the "easy" class for guaranteed raid invites. I've been playing since release and I feel like there are more Priest than Hunters around, at least half of them not knowing what the hell they're doing. On the other hand I know full well that i'll probably never see the insides of a raid because I'm not a Dwarf.

Yeah as I thought it‚Äôs mostly all +healing, well, all of it is actually. I think a warrior or hunter + me healing would be an unstoppable combo but I don‚Äôt have a hunter. I do have one level 22 but unsure if it‚Äôs even effective for gold to level it
