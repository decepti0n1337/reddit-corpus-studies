it's not a pve server actually MATE! it's a Role Play server

Is it?

you *REALLY* think its intended for a random dungeon item to be a DHK generator put in the game for that purpose in 2004

*really*

If you don’t want macros you can simply just keybind it. i.eI use shift + scroll wheel down to use car form. And shift + scroll wheel up for bear form.

Joined group for DM:W. Healer left, Party Leader started looking for new one as I immediately flew out from Org after joining. He then invites a Mage instead of a Healer, filling up the party. This exchange happens, and the new mage offers to leave. Then I get booted as I land. I get helping a friend, but that is just so massively lame.
---
&gt; why, what i do doesn't affect you.
---
Well ever since they broke follow in BGs, what you clowns do doesn't really impact me. I still find it incredibly unsporting, though. 
---
&gt; If boxxers bother you so much why don'y you go play a single player game?
---
I enjoy the social aspect of forming groups and working together. Kind of a weird question to ask me, frankly. Youre the one playing a franken character cause you don't wanna chat with people.
---
&gt; MS doing almost double the damage of BT in current tier and sword spec being an insane talent almost makes up for the loss of flurry and deathwish
---
It really doesn’t come close
---
He made an alt.  That’s his whole story, he has a level 20 alt.
---
Yes. Based on my rank 3 guildie buying my epic mechanostrider and trading it to me for 800g. I’d assume it would work for alts with one more trade
---
Azeroth... Azeroth is where you wear your hat!
---
Anybody know what his gear is like? I would love to play the balance/resto hybrid and want to know if It’s more gear reliant than a hotw Druid.
---
&gt;Is it ethical to take one life to save many?  It's the Trolley Problem
---
Except it is not. The Trolley Problem is a binary choice between letting one group of people or another die, the death is a given, you're forced to weigh their worth. Nothing about civillians being "potential spies" is a given, and even in the event that they are, it is not certain that you're going to be killed as a result of their intel.
---
You cannot bend ethics whenever it serves you, and situations like these are why it's considered unethical and illegal to torture PoWs, never mind kill them.
---
&gt; We kill battle chickens and and Barov peasants summoned by trinkets freely. Should we make those dishonorable? 
---
No, because those actively fight you. Killing them is self defense. The eye is just watching.
---
&gt; Should we also make hunter and warlock pets dishonorable kills? How many pets out there are enslaved against their will and forced to act in the interests of their owners? 
---
Please do not reduce this discussion to trolling.
---
\#Don'tTroll
---
From my understanding they do not spawn on a static timer-its a more complex system that gives it a % chance to respawn between 2-4 days after they were killed.
---
One of the examples I've seen, which I am unsure to how accurate it is, is that they have a \~30% chance to spawn 2 days after they were killed, \~40% 3 days after they were killed and \~30% 4 days after they were killed. It kind of makes sense since it can be a very random and sporadic repop timer.
---
I can't download anything on my laptop, only IT can that's where my trouble lies, I tried downloading it haha

---
Depends on how nice your group is, probably 50/50 whether someone needs on it. Maybe just ask before you kill the boss
---
I solo 90% of the time but okay.
---
Recipe is boe but the item turns bop once you craft it
---
Yeah but a cat sleeping on a keyboard of a shadowpriest can kill a retri paladin.
---
Some groups do all roll on high value items. Maybe ask them before you start, form the group yourself with it reserved, or farm gold and buy it off the AH.
---
The pattern is indeed BoE, meaning people in the group might roll need on it too sell it on the auction house.
---
In my opinion it would probably be best to buy it on the auction house yourself instead of trying to farm it (if you don't need other items from the dungeon).
---
It usually sells for quite cheap and there is often a lot of them listed (on Gehennas-EU it sells for 5-10g).
---
I think it is as simple as more people played alliance in vanilla and now they want to play horde to try the other side.
---
I don't buy the racials thing since private servers were usually pretty balanced between factions and whoever was the bigger faction changed Everytime a new server was released, so it kinda went back and forth between both sides.
---
No i didnt, it's just that you seem to not understand that sunwell was in the game so i tried another way.
---
Runeblade isn't the only HP regen weapon; there's the Resurgence Staff from the Maraudon quest that a warrior could use (if they don't take Thrash Blade lol). There's also Milli's Shield.
---
Lol THIS. It really isn’t that hard. I still right down everything I need and where it is from. Plus you get the satisfaction of scribbling over it once you get it. So good
---
No, you obviously dont understand the words you are using.
---
There's this: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dk9k79/which_site_or_addon_do_you_use_to_see_bis_gear/
---
Or: BiS Tracker https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bis-tracker-classic
---
Or: AtlasLoot
---
You could always just write down the names of the items on a piece of paper or keep them up on your phone while you're playing, and when something drops and you have the chance to roll, just double-check your notes/phone.
---
I'm sure others have better input, but I tried.
---
Just don’t flask
---
4-7 days respawn timer. Server reset will reset the timer so they can spawn earlier.
---
&gt; Lol please quote where I am personally attacking you? 
---
Here you go:
---
&gt; Why can't **YOU** win the fight fairly? Why do **YOU** have to try and cheese a dishonorable kill?
---
Rather than provide arguments for your case, you attack MY character and what you presume are my actions. You do not even support why using the eye is not "fighting fairly", despite it being a fucking 5 second cast that you have to keep channeling and the enemy killing it like a moron, which is a massive disadvantage to you.
---
Shame on you for gaslighting.
---
&gt; I pop this behind a tree and run it into your blizzard. Based on your "logic" you deserved that DHK. 
---
Sure you did. You heard the channeling sound, you did nothing, you continued your braindead AoE farm. You saw an eye come towards you, you continued farming. You were unaware, and got punished for it. You can learn from that mistake, or you can complain like a child. Your choice.
---
Yeah if u really wanna have a lot of fun playing a warrior you want a pocket healer and if you are alliance you want that pocket to be a holy paladin.
---
War + any healer works but paladin is the best by far.
---
Quick and the most efficient heals in the game, best buffs in the game to counter almost any attack, 40 yd (base) auras to defend against all major player spells or melee or counter spell pushback and silences, most durable healer by a long shot with full plate and 3 lives or more.
---
Pair them up with strong and maneuverable DPS and it's an almost unstoppable machine.
---
&gt; If it takes more than 2 hours, it’s not worth it.
---
Holy hell this is priceless. When was the last time you even played retail?
---
Just be fury/prot and end up getting to dps and tank.
---
So far off base it's not even funny.  These are horde raids on the way to MC.  They kill alliance in the way so their world buffs don't get picked off or dispelled.  You put your body in the way of a wrecking ball, don't blame the operator.  Nobody from the horde group feels skilled for having kill them.  The alliance should have just run away the horde wouldn't chase very far from the route straight to MC.
---
90% of the downvotes are from mages
---
There are many people who don’t love it because they legitimately cannot play. They log in and get ganked in their capital city before getting ganked everywhere they go in the world.
---
And server population problems or not, it’s actual people doing the ganking. People who choose to take actions that knowingly make the game unplayable for others.
---
Like... just own it man. Stop with the excuses. You want to gank people you can. You want to deny them being able to play you can. But call it what it is.
---
Keep to one comment. Collect your thoughts, then proceed and post. Im not gonna follow your sissy ramblings all over the place.
---
Sorry for the confusion, Heal 2 does not become more mana efficient until you are past 250 healing.  Under 200 has GHeal as more efficient.  It's just simple math and you can't say it's wrong then accept a website doing the same thing.
---
I'm not using this to rigidly heal but to better understand how downranking is dynamic and changes with your gear.   The 1110 meter is a good "Does it make sense" test.  I was trying to figure out what I should be using for that value.
---
Yea, re-rolling. I just finished my MC attunement and was ready to begin raiding when I re-started. 
---
Honestly, it's about the journey more than the destination. I'm moving from Whitemane which is a top population server that still has queues most evenings. The PVE servers are nearly as populated so you'd have people to group with. 
---
Also, waiting for paid server xfers is a pipe dream. IMO that won't happen for months. In that same time you could be playing on a server that you actually enjoy. After all, this is game and games are meant to be fun. If you're not having fun, then what are you doing?
---
Can anybody explain how pop ranking works.
---
Logged in to check and see if I ranked and my stats are just weird.
---
Says 0 for today, I had 3 this morning.
---
Lists 7 for yesterday, that was 2 days ago.
---
Lists 21 for this week, i did get around 14 between last night and the 3 this morning.
---
0 for last week, I think that's right, pretty sure I didnt pvp on this toon at all before the last few days.
---
But then it says I have 14 lifetime?  I'm confused lol.
---
I don't aoe camp there, but I kinda expected this kind of response with how people have been regarding pvp
---
you can always swap to a set, but you cannot use multiple auras.  Also you can still use the armor aura, but cannot use redoubt if you didnt spend the points. 
---
The downside to redoubt is that you can't block while casting.
---
Oh yeah cause everyone had the time to play 12 hours per day every day since launch to reach level 60 and gather all wanted loot before phase 2 hits. 
---
Got any more of those intelligent tips to give us?
---
They are \~100g on my server, or were a couple weeks back
---
These guys were on the way to MC as a horde supergroup.  This isn't really about PvP this is about keeping world buffs.  Honestly if the alliance would have just moved out of the way a bit they wouldn't have been chased very far.  They just want to get to MC with their raid and buffs intact.
---
&gt;&gt; Lol please quote where I am personally attacking you?

Jesus is your ego that fragile that you think I'm attacking you?
---
It's raidnight. There are 5k horde online and 2k alliance. Any horde who isn't online doesn't get to raid, even if they queue for 5 hours?
---
There is no dungeon etiquette, so many people are complete douches in them :/
---
Will I come off as a ass for leaving my current guild for a new start for another guild? Not really happy in my current guild. There's this guild that I want to join that does a lot of pvp/rp events that my guild doesnt does. All I do is just raid log with them and it's getting kinda stale. Also I know a few of them don't like me bc I'm the top dps and their close friends are not.
---
Wf totem is nice in pve but doesn’t really get much use in pvp.  And you’d rather have freedom in pvp anyway.
---
Watch the video and check out parses Bud. 😘
---
Sorry dont have my russian keyboard right now
---
Seen SGC 3x times during leveling. Got it at level 56.
---
You're not really addressing the point. These guys are going out of their way to camp outside a minor Horde capital to farm honor (think of that what you will). It's impossible to pass through until a large enough raid wants to pass, or until enough players bother to move and clear the path. Your complaints in this context are ridiculous.
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular\_reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning) 
---
In case you were actually unaware of why your circular reasoning is poor reasoning.
---
He said his first run not the guilds, and even so it's mc most people know it nothing is too hard to teach.
---
Don't play a druid but I appreciate Javel posting addons+wtf folder in the description of the video.
---
And that is a totally valid reason to spend less time on the game, care less, go at your own pace, whatever. But excuses like "the community is too influenced by twitch streamers" is ridiculous. You don't have to play on Faerlina or Golemagg. You don't have to follow guides/min-max/dungeon cleave if you don't want to. I've met plenty of people in game who don't do any of those things and they're all playing and enjoying the game just fine.
---
Reminds me of a Sunken Temple run a few months ago. Cat had dash on, I sent her at one of the trolls in Jammal'an's room, she started dashing, and promptly got feared at a huge speed into the middle of the room. My laughter at the sheer speed turned into "oh shit" when 2 more groups came back with the cat.
---
I was extremely apologetic and turned dash off after that, but thankfully we survived and the group saw the funny side of it.
---
I’ve tanked  every dungeon on my shaman and im 32 it’s fun
---
Dont fly to burning steppes, fly to redridge and run along the southern edge to BRM. You will guaranteed get camped if you fly to burning steppes.
---
And huge queues next week. Enjoy!
---
I'm having trouble finding a gear guide for a level 49 twink elemental shaman. Can anyone help me out?
---
what?
---
People keep trying to sell me on this idea that you need everyone in your raid to flask up for Naxx but it's simply not true.  Especially since there are a lot of classes for which flasks are mostly useless.
---
Dafuq did I just watch. Thanks.
---
Lmao, people did not like this.
---
And that's a legitimate strategy for winning a fight. It has counterplay, and you have the choice to just take the DHK and win the fight right away as the other side has players doing nothing but scouting. There's nothing wrong with it, neither have you presented anything wrong with it, other than call using it "unfair" and "cheesy" with no basis. Shameful.

By the time AQ and Naxx come out gold will be so worthless the prices will be insane anyway.

u forgot RFC my guy
---
Healing is the opposite of useless in pvp. You control what happens 100%
---
The secret to Classic is whenever you meet a non-douche add them to your friends list. Pretty soon you’ll have a bunch of people to run instances with who you know are solid.
---
Reputation matters. People think it doesn’t, but they’ll quickly find out.
---
So you rolled on the wrong server type for your temperament.  Either work around the issue or leave but no one cares about you giving ultimatums.
---
While this is true, the game relies on a social interaction and social hierarchy. What ever you achieve you do so relative to your peers. Otherwise it's a one player game. 
---
There for they are at the bottom of the pile. In order to keep up they must also quantify and optimise every aspect of game play. This changes your play style and potentially changes it into a play style you don't enjoy.
---
Personally I lvld my war to 60 with zero add-ons and zero googling(self pat). I loved it.  Im a firm believer that once everything is quantifide and optimised the mystery and adventure is lost. And that's why I play these games. 
---
So I completely understand why they might have quit. Add-ons and comprehensive internet guides change the game completely.
---
If you've got map icons turned on, I find it helpful to just look at the world map for clusters of quests.  At ~48 for example a bunch of stuff in Burning Steppes lit up.
---
This is not a problem on my server. Rogues gank me in UC and gnome mages hide behind camp majoche inn to flight path camp just like horde rogues kill in iron forge and horde gank Morgan's vigil. 
---
Both factions take turns controlling the major pvp zones also. That's why nobody cares. We want this. You have a server problem not a people problem.
---
The alliance did this on Lucifron. They now ruined our perfectly fine 50:50 server (it's 70:30 alliance:horde) now. 
---
Half of Horde quit. Our guild is struggling at recruiting players. This is just stupid.
---
Gold, gotta buy or farm cards
---
I don’t fail to understand anything, you require a shield in PvE, I just don’t pull aggro.  I wear plate in PvP, 5000 armour isn’t too far off, and like you said, diminishing returns.  
---
I never argued that block % wasn’t important at all, some specs will love them some 30%.  But you aren’t pushing crits off the table in shockadin gear no matter how hard you try.  A block cannot be a crit, but on the other hand a crit cannot be blocked, and you aren’t getting enough avoidance to push those off the table.  sure you’ll push some crushes off the table, maybe even most of them, and thats good, if you’re well practiced enough to maintain proper facing at all times.  
---
You use a 2H weapon.
---
This is awesome. Thank you. I had no idea AtlasLoot could do this. I just thought it was a directory for gear and nothing else.
---
Yeah youd be pretty much 40+% crit chance fully raid buffed
---
Sacrifice and suffering are bound. Those are spell one and two. Each pet has spell one and two bound.  It literally says it in my post
---
What are those?
---
This might explain why every time I post something here, it almost immediatly gets a downvote.
---
Everything is fair in love and war. This aint world of lovecraft baby. 🙂
---
But then you can’t area deny on pvp servers - quite a large change there.
---
That's most people really. It doesn't take much to corrupt the average joe. Give them a taste of money and power and see how they react.
---
I would recommend getting the gloves from lbrs that give +8 weapon skill and 1% hit, so they give you 4% hit, shouldnt have Problems reaching the cap with that without having to spend Gold on devilsaur before epic mount
---
On it. Haha. Im glad people suggested other options. 😂
---
Nope, hunters are also still hunters... We were trialing a hunter and we did an Ony attunement day for new recruits. On the Rend run, Dalrend OH drops and he need rolls, along with 2 warriors. Thankfully he didn't win it, but he got immediately gkicked and 2 days later we saw him wearing a guild tag of a guild we PVP with. Gkicked again :)
---
Skeram Shoutout.! 
---
-&lt;Invictus&gt;
---
But that’s when everyone else is on because “hardly anyone else is on” I do open world herb and fish farms and legit see more people at odd hours farming than I do at normal hours lol
---
&gt;g on your side but I tested it and it did work.
---
You tested this at R7 ? The balls...
---
Well you doing top dps is more of a reflection of the other warlocks in your guild than the gear. There are warlocks in my guild that use greens with +shadow damage on them, especially shoulders, bracers and helm/want slots. They do insanely good dps but die insanely fast if they get hit.
---
Here are warcraft logs from the guild in question: https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/DtghfqncwWY1BVC3/
---
The que has nothing to do with payment type
---
Just make dishonorable kills not exist in a BG.
---
Yeah, but if they have enemy nameplates on, they’d still be able to see you. Lol. Clever tho.!
---
Because then he couldn’t whine here about pvp happening on a pvp server.
---
&gt; Adapt and overcome. Don't cry on Reddit.
---
Reddit sure didnt adapt and overcome when it came to roofcamping, lmao  
---
Why do you think everything in the game is deliberate? One is a quest item, the other is a quirky trinket, some developer just shrugged and set them as civilian, not much thought into it.
---
i restarted the game multiple times and let it sit for over an hour. It didn't move me forward until i had a completed payment for the account. what else could it be?
---
Modern WoW (sacrilege to mention here I know) needs like a quest building/solo instance building thing like the recent neverwinter mmo had or whatever. That would be neat.
---
I agree, but I still go arms until Trash Blade for the 30-45 pvp.
---
He seems surprised at the outcome, but why did he have that addon on the first place?
---
You wouldn’t even be able to que if the payment didn’t process
---
In our guild people who want to be tank are on the list. They are DPS until a tank spot gets free for whatever reason. But yes, if you want to be a pure tank, then you either need to get lucky (like some in my guild did) or join a new guild.
---
I'd be salty after that. Hunters will replace it will t1 chest, which due to the low number of hunters should not take very long in MC. Warriors don't get better chest for quite awhile. What a tosser
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;Nope.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;But when you try to push a narrative so that people agree with you it is.
---
I took your *own narrative* for the sake of discussion, no need to give me credit. The passage I quoted - from you - suggested a scenario where the Alliance, instead of "doing something about it", would run recklessly into BRM, where walls of Horde were waiting. I introduced some real world circumstances (particularly, egregious imbalance accelerated by faction exodus), readily witnessed via video evidence on this subreddit. You didn't have an answer. I didn't expect you to, because there isn't one.
---
&gt;The people that have left, have left due to PvP on a PvP server. These are the people that don't help you when you are getting ganked. 
---
You got it right below; I agree that "people had a misguided assumption of what PvP servers would entail then were shocked when they found out it meant that getting camped". Characters on the vastly outnumbered faction are a lost cause, a sunk cost. It sucks that it has to be that way. It's going to turn PvP servers into PvE servers where only one faction can reasonably play. We saw this happen with Illidan. We'll see this play out again with some classic servers.
---
Blizzard is attempting to buy time with an early battlegrounds release, but the damage is already done. The BG queues will be super long for the dominant faction anyway, and they'll want to make that downtime up by camping the other faction until it pops.
---
It doesn't get better. Get out while you can.
---
can people come in after Domo is downed and loot the box similar to how DM trib runs work?
---
PvP server, I had a mage so I didn't really need to use boats at all.
---
1-60 was a relatively PvP-less experience, on the occasion you did see horde they would just keep farming without really caring you're there unless you attacked them first.
---
&gt; That's pretty useless in pvp.  
---
Highly disagree. With T2+ gear, your flash heals will heal as much as a greater heal when you first hit 60 in nothing but greens.   
---
Even better, depending on the size of the fights, you can downrank and conserve enough mana to be the one solely responsible for winning a game of tug-o-war in AV.  
---
Without geared healers, the PVP party dies.
---
then what else could the reason be? my girlfriend bought the account with her card and is in game now. I'm sitting at 1700.
---
Well if youre a cow then it really doesnt matter that much. Just know youre gonna need a lot of hit chance or you buy an edgemasters.
---
tempo represent :)
---
Imagine reporting someone for cross faction speak when ur just pissed cus you got PvP'd on a PvP server 🤣🤣🤣👍
---
if the hordes are stupid enough to not attack a civilian they deserve the dhk
---
Coming from the pussies who join the overpopulated zerg faction because they know it's the safe bet. Roll Alliance Mr. PvP and lets see all your awesome moves
---
As others have said, respec now and start getting your pre-raid BIS fear, and level up while you do it. Kill 2 birds with 1 stone!
---
Its all Nzoths doing.
---
Why can't you have a discussion without personally attacking me? Just because I disagree with you all of a sudden I am shameful.
---
That's just sad. Have a nice day.
---
Definitely bon board with this. I mean. It will take a few months for people to get the cheat sheets out there for those that want to optimise/ are lazy af (hurrhurr). All up classic + will be where wow classic gets it vanilla feel back. 
---
I mean.. an epic quest is one where you venture into the unknown and return with an interesting sorry and maybe some sweet gear as a trophy.. not one where you follow old mates instructions to point x and then pick up x item. That's just running errands..
---
Sure but Brm and epl are the worst.  Avoiding them in peak time is a good tactical decision.
---
;p
---
It's AFK bear tank.
---
Still, meaningless.  I agree it'll be broken for BGs.  But people quitting over this, I don't see that at all.  And it's funny, my guild just posted this on discord (apart from me).  So, it's gonna ruin P2 for everyone meaning ranking is going to be whatever.
---
Dude the tubers/blossoms stack with heal potions, and use the Healthstone CD timer. They also don't trigger GCD so you can macro Tubers *with* your potions. I use them like crack in PvP.
---
Macro'd with a Major Heal, it can heal you for 2500hp+.
---
What you say doesn't make sense.
---
Better gear will make you heal better in pvp or whatever.
---
You are clueless but enjoy living in your bubble.
---
im a big scrub new to raid healing in classic, only run mc twice lol. to me it seems like getting thr chance for a tick or two of mp5 is kind of rng or outside of something you can 'work in' to the rotation. like i'm not sure what happens, but sometimes it seems like a tank wont get smacked as hard by a boss or add, and if theyre topped off i can maybe get a tick or two of regen (if i dont panic at damaged dps and throw some heals their way). then on the dispel fights, it feels like i never get a chance to stop casting. i've got about 350 +heals.. maybe i should be using renew to give myself some space to regen?
---
Wow, I did!
---
How original
---
You think you want it but you don't, amirite?
---
Max Camera
---
35 sounds easy as fucking cutting cheese. Try 50.
---
Jfc yes!  As others have said, I use auctionator and set the undercut to 1c.  Someone posted 200 of an item for 50% and I bought them all up at a cost of 80g thinking that item ALWAYS sells what I sell it for.  Well, for some mf reason, probably due to the volume of items undercutter mcfuckface posted, all items are now being posted at that 50% price.
---
Which was great at first but now I can't afford to keep buying up the cheap shit bc they dont sell faster than the new items come up.
---
It works fine now that you can HS queue
---
Oh shut the fuk up Randall
---
Yeah its honestly not too bad, its only a few packs to get to it from the back entrance.

Nothing will change.  The price of lotus right now is already higher than it might otherwise be because of the big guilds already beginning to stockpile flasks and flask mats for later phases.
---
Not to mention, most DKP guilds won't allow OS over MS bidding. If a tank item drops, there is no DPS allowed to bid on this. Only if the tanks don't need it will the non tanks be allowed to bid on it.
---
As a horde pve player on a pvp server im def using this on my way into BRM
---
How do you know they didn't just edit the video to show some other area, and it is in fact the entrance to BRD, these poor allies are just trying to do the first step of the onyxia attunement for once in their life, and here comes the horde pain train doing laps around the area causing misery? I recorded an almost identical video earlier and the characters have been superimposed on this different area in order to discredit the alliance cause and make it look like its OUR FAULT. Youre saying its OUR fault?! No.
---
If only the flight paths in wow did that
---
Lionsheart aint too bad if you slowly grind it out. Theres also tanks that sell their services for 20+ or first righteous orb.
---
Lol ok I get it you are upset and you need people to hate to rationalize it. Sure thing. Have a good one man.
---
Yes it was. It's called Seeping Corruption.
---
Yes, and it sucks.
---
The irony is palpable. Good talk, friend.
---
You have been awarded 1 honor.
---
If you are super well geared it is possible. Our current MT runs this specc because he is geared enough that it becomes better than pure prot.
---
If you aren't, you better be ready to respecc. Last time we missed a tank, 2 people were ready to spend the 50 Gold to respecc and another 50 to specc to DPS again after this.
---
immediately dies to 1v5
---
Couple years from now prolly
---
"Everybody should bend over backwards for our Warrior overlords and know their BiS list for all 6 phases"
---
Fuck them. It's Mail. Warriors get to wear plate and be the best (and for the most part only viable) tanks in the game. In addition to that they're the best PvP class with a healer on their ass. They just gotta have all loot given to them so they can be a top DPS class, too?
---
The amount of "your class will replace this item in 2-3 months tops while my class will have to wait 10 months for an upgrade" is honestly staggering. If I can use it and it's an upgrade for me I'm taking it and I don't give a shit.
---
LOL 50 TRY 500
---
People exaggerate and Horde Bashing is F R E E K A R M A here atm. Sure world is overpopulated like shit but isn’t that what people wanted? I like the shit show so far, it’s dangerous to go alone!
---
&gt;Reddit sure didnt adapt and overcome when it came to roofcamping, lmao
---
Possibly because roofcamping is definitionally an exploit?
---
&gt; Why do you think everything in the game is deliberate?  
---
Why do you think it isn't? You've concocted this theory about it being a dev oversight (that he explicitly clicked a flag to mark them as civilians), but where does that stop exactly? Frost Shock's damage is a bit too high, I guess the devs inputted the wrong number for its base damage?
---
&gt; see what's going to be on reddit then. 
---
I don't care what's going on on Reddit. I don't let my opinion on issues be dictated by how others feel about it. That is a very weak argument.
---
Yep. My little brother and I rolled new characters together last week. I am trying a mage because I haven't played one in many years and he went warlock. He asked me what was the best spec was for classic warlock and I said, "who cares? Play what you want."
---
We're just gonna blast some stuff all the way to 60 and have a great time doing it.
---
Renew resets Mp5, since you're still casting a spell. Elv UI does this great thing on your mana bar showing the cooldown before regen kicks in. The easiest way to play healer (this is for paladin) is to ABC (always be casting), and you can cancel your casts by strafing near the end of it so it doesn't go off. Only 1 person should be using renew in your raid, so make sure other people aren't using Renew before you decide to cast it, or even have it on your bars.
---
Your gryphon knew a short cut
---
Went in DM at the min level, almost no XP, like less  than half a level. Went in at 14 and got almost a full level. The level 14 run was carried by someone below 60, and had 3 others around DM level in it. The min level run was just the min level with a 60.
---
I wish. Had 2 groups fall apart due to being ganked near dire maul and another at epl. And epl flight point was camped by horde nearly every time I was there.
---
Maybe there's some statistical bias that explains our different experiences. Maybe we're just both noticing the bad times. Or it's just bad luck.
---
I didn't read the wall of text but I'm to say you're wrong.
---
This makes the whole thing make more sense. That is pretty shitty.
---
No, very poor talk. I recommend you pick up some books on debating ettiquette &amp; argumentation in general, because your discourse is solely lacking.
---
You’re as clever as you are original.  I mean that.
---
We need healer druids, not tanks. Just like we need Healer shamans not Enh.
---
What about when you die? Oh it takes so much longer.  Just straight shot it
---
I just drained my coin funds gilding this post and some of the equally amazing replies. This made my day.
---
This sole argument started out as me saying Imp Devo Aura is a complete waste of points compared to its counterpart, and I stand by it. With that said, I'll answer the points you've listed.
---
Me requiring a slot for a shield in all content is only reasonable, you should not have that dire of invetory issue and picking up a shield is piss easy.
---
In the context of pvp healing, in a shockadin spec, redoubt is also the only option. Block WILL shove off crit the spectrum of possible hits, so stop fooling yourself there. Going into holy/reckoning build you're going to pick redoubt, and if you're going shockadin you have to be well geared to make it work out. You have 20 points left to spare, which is best put into protection due to the strongest Blessing is improved in the tree and BoK is the second strongest blessing you can apply in the current phase meta. One way or another you will have to go through tier 1 of Prot Talents.
---
A shield will also provide a buffer against a Rogue's Expose Armour. A shield and redoubt will give you a big avoidance chance at blocking/dodging/parrying a gouge from a rogue. For pvp there's no reason to travel without a shield in the off hand slot in case you do get ganked. The only real pieces you'd want instead of a shield in your off hand in our currnet phase is a Drakestone of Healing, Thaurissan's Royal Scepter, or a random uncommon off hand with up to 35 healing power. As a shockadin you will equip a shield in your offhand if you're seriously invested in pvp in any way or form as you're being threatened by a physical dps. End of story.
---
You only use a 2h weapon for holy/reck build, not shockadin like the context you implied earlier out of the blue.
---
I’m literally a mod of FC. I know how HS works. Go take a look at the gear of warriors in the current #1 MC run. You’ll see many stacking hit above 6%. Regardless, I’m not sure what you’re on about aside from flexing old TC, bc you didn’t even respond to what I wrote—you brought up crit priority, which not once did I mention
---
Let both guilds what the reasoning for the switch is. Be polite and all things should work out. (Guildleaders talk to eachother esp on rp pvp realms)
---
Oh look, more personal attacks.
---
Reminds me of someone complaining they were killed on the way to SM as alliance. They got asked where they died and they said between the zeppelin and UC. 
---
Do you chug lead paint? You went to a Horde captial and was surprised you died? Not sure why people thought they could camp the main route horde raids take.
---
I'm not the only one that's how broken games work. They either get fixed or the community dies down
---
I thought that teaching him to fish, by telling him where those kinds of guides are, would be more valuable than simply linking it to him or typing a summary.
---
For the record, I respond to a number of questions in this thread with actual information.  But when someone asks for a guide to the bar and I know one is on wowhead and i tell them to check wowhead...I'm not sure why I'm the bad guy.
---
When someone wants an opinion, or information that is more niche or not as easily available as this guide was...those are the questions that deserve thought and attention in this thread.
---
I expect people to learn to be self sufficient and I'm not going to apologize for that.
---
That will still be minmaxed as much as possible, minmaxing will mever go away, regardless of classic+ or tbc. The only difference is people will have to start figuring it out from scratch, but by the time the average person reaches the content it would have already been cleared and minmaxed by the streamers and hardcore. So it wont be much different in that regard.
---
&gt; We are at an impasse if you don't see how watching someone's movements is often done with hostile intent.
---
How do you know it is hostile intent? Maybe they're scouting up ahead to make sure there isn't a large group about to gank them, similar to a shaman using Far Sight. And then you kill that scouting eye that this player had to run Strat for. It's only fair that you should be punished for your dishonorable action.
---
it is literally the opposite as a horde on my server
---
You have to actually logout, or wait for the server to disconnect  you - which takes longer.  If you just alt f4 or exit it won’t have logged you out by the time you come back.
---
Nah dude, cross realm BGs. Everyone's queues will be close to instant and you'll never recognize any of the players in the BG.
---
It's sad to see classic die, but just quit IMO I'm sure you have better things to do then be some no lifers honor grind.
---
I suppose if you take even benign advice such as this as a personal attack, I suppose I can see how your debating style came to be.
---
Because people bitch if you don’t want to level and get BiS as fast as possible. I’m more of a journey not destination person, can’t play as often as I’d like, and people were gatekeeping and saying I didn’t *really* play and didn’t *really* love the game. Bitches, I’m taking my sweet-ass time, none of this rushing to top crap. Same as in retail.
---
A lot of warriors will play gnomes on ally for the racial in pvp
---
Came here to say this word for word.
---
BGs gonna be cross realm, why would there be long queues?
---
This is why when you're in trouble they teach you to yell "fire" instead of "help."
---
Love it
---
Yeah it's not required. Maybe one for the main tank.
---
This was enough to trigger you to make a reddit post?
---
Want a medal no lifer?
---
And if you are lucky enough you have a community that cares enough about the game to voice their opinions on why the game is broken before they jump ship.
---
Now I'm wondering: what would happen if we changed some parameters? Say, double the gravity. Would that curve still be the optimal, or would the more extreme drop start to overtake it?
---
I've mentioned before that I never see the same person doing it twice, because I report them, but I always get downvoted for saying it because I play horde lol
---
This really does suck. Enemies appear 20 ft in fort of me... What the fuck is this shit. No chance to do anything.
---
You get it from turning in 3 battleground marks. So every win or 3 losses hours get experience.
---
Not exactly a fast way to level but it’s possible.
---
Since you can only queue from cities or the zone bg portal it’s gonna be hard for many of them to be that far away from a city.
---
Horde queueing for bgs are unlikely to make it to kargath-&gt; Brm for example.
---
Even more so when it’s AV weekend because you can’t group queue for that, you have to queue yourself at the battle master (or altercation portal)
---
Could get worse.
---
Younger friend of mine wrote a script to do the run. It just repeatedly tries to rez at min distance to mc entrance. Once i left it on overnight and when i saw it in the morning still running and rezzing, a few horde sitting there at the end point, waiting to kill a naked gnome again. I wonder how much honor it gave away over 7 hours
---
&gt;I have on occasion been using downranked rejuv on tanks, since the max rank just uses so much mana. But wasn't sure if it was even worth it since the healing coefficients are so low.
---
Downranked rejuv is actually really efficient (rank 4 in particular), but it'll often get overridden...i've struggled with that one myself because it's as good as HT3 actually...it just becomes inefficient if people snipe your heals.  I use max Rejuv on tanks to keep them topped up and downrank for everything else (except "oh shit" heals).
---
&gt; One interesting thing I've read that I wouldn't mind trying later is regrowth spec. Just using the downranked regrowth with the Regrowth talent (crit) and Nature's Grace which gives you the 0.5sec cast reduction on the next spell. 
---
I'm not sure what to think of this.  There is virtually never a time where Regrowth is efficient...but it does seem to be a prominent build.  I'd argue that regrowth is effectively just the druid flash heal at that point...and just as inefficient.
---
Looking back at private server forums (e.g. Nostalrius), there is a quite a bit of debate over regrowth builds with some very strong proponents and some equally strong opponents.
---
So, lost 3 Paladin helms 50/50s (lack of Paladins or other Paladins already have it). Lost multiple rolls off some worse odds. And worst of all, 2 helms drop with 3 paladins in the raid, give you one guess who didn't get one. 
---
At least I am in a guild and will eventually run out of people to try to get it against me.
---
BIG NUMBERS!
---
Wherever you go, there you are.
---
Not only there is no spot for you in raids, 3 out of 4 tanks get to just tank trash mobs while one single person gets to have all the fun tanking bosses.
---
Problem was blizzard went no changes for this part of the game and shoulda done what private servers had been doing forever and have it at the start of the game. This would of still fallen in line with previous decisions this team made with content and certain features. Giving players a timeframe to prep for pvp is a bad decision and set the precedence  early on that it wasnt worth fighting eachother when theres no honor behind it.
---
TLDR: “The way you choose to play and have fun in the game is entirely up to you.  Unless I disagree with it.”
---
There, saved you all that essay.
---
Whenever I see “ok boomer” I lol pretty hard. Alliance on Skeram. Gotta find fun in the little things since I can’t really play in the open world. I find the stupid shit horde say in chat hilarious.
---
sled made from a broken door, pulled by two rioting defias.
---
Exactly this.
---
My boy! Look how they massacred my boy!
---
are you damn sure? lol i dont want to burn my MC run this week, that would be a catastrophe
---
what server?
---
came to make a joke about the horde complaining about guard spawns on an alliance boats in chat, saw someone beat me to it.
---
How often do you get to fight lvl 63 mobs, out of your total raid time?
---
Half the fun in this game for me (outside of raiding) is fighting over resource nodes, can't do that when everyone is friendly.
---
And now gaslighting. Shameful.
---
Yeah except he still participated in destroying Darnassus lol
---
&gt; Possibly because roofcamping is definitionally an exploit?  
---
The true definition of an exploit is just what Blizzard decides is an exploit, so what's your point? We're talking about what's scummy and griefing, and if it should become ban worthy or not.
---
&gt; Frost Shock's damage is a bit too high, I guess the devs inputted the wrong number for its base damage?
---
Yeah it's called balancing lol.  
---
&gt; I don't care what's going on on Reddit. I don't let my opinion on issues be dictated by how others feel about it. That is a very weak argument.  
---
We're discussing the hypocrisy of reddit, thus it's relevant, but what ever makes you feel individualistic and powerful dawg.
---
Yes but I have no idea when.
---
You two are the wrong ones. This game is meant to be fun. 
---
Not a job
---
Problem with that is, the people complaining about going into the unknown, will unlikely to be the first into it, so wowhead will already be crawling with guides and strategies. So you only keep the "mystery" if you actively avoid all that, which you can do now already.
---
I think we may yet see those posts come back when groups of people start getting obliterated by chain lightnings and shocks in battlegrounds.
---
Or maybe it's just a dead horse from 2005 when frost shock was considered the most broken spell in the whole game.
---
You can’t use the quest item in a BG, which is what this post is about. I have stated in other comments though that if it works with training dummies too that’s gotta go.
---
Hey it could be worse... You could have corpse walks going to any instance regardless of time or day.
---
Just quit dude it's only a 15 year old video game
---
We will have plenty of time to gear up for it
---
Most guilds dont want run MC in 4+ hours. I'm sure you can find a casual guild of guys just like yourself, but the idea behind getting pre-raid BiS is the time invested is time saved during raid.
---
This only works for wsg in this phase though.  You can’t group queue for AV.
---
So probably the quietest times in world pvp will be AV weekend.
---
I rerolled from 4 level mid 40 chars.  I gave up when it took me 2.5 hours to do 4 quests in stv.
---
Last night I went 53-54 in 3 hours just questing.
---
Leveling in a normal (pve) server is at least 50% faster.
---
So honor was fucked this week, I get that, but when I logged on this morning after maintenance my honor seemed like it was accurate. It was much higher than what it had been for the week and since I felt a good portion of my kills weren't tracked correctly I assumed this new higher number to be the correction, I logged in again after the 2nd authentication maintenance and it went up another 2k for the week (adding the honor from yesterday) and I was sitting at 22k for the week. I get home today after work and it has my last week's honor at 12k... I know for a fact that's not anywhere near high enough. Is there anything I can do?
---
SS procs on WW also so it’s still worse.
---
A sleigh driven by murlocs
---
You knew we were going to say join a casual guild yet instead of making the right choice for you (joining a more casual guild) you are saying that all the people who enjoy min/maxing should stop enjoy it because you don't?
---
&gt;When was the last time you even played retail
---
Now you’re getting it
---
What if in this crazy world.. Being efficient is *fun* to some people?
---
Ya everyone's lying about it taking 30 - 50 minutes to get to BRD. /s
---
What's the earliest I can do the In The Name of the Light quest for SM? Sites say level 34 but some people in my guild are saying I can do it earlier
---
Why would you think 1v1s would be what you would get on a pvp server?
---
Ok coomer.
---
The new content guides will take a little while to become stream lined and comprehensive however. So well atleast get a few months of good old fashioned problem solving? Hopefully? &gt;&lt;
---
No way man, you can't go against the minmax circlejerk!
---
I've taken hunters in to my arena runs because... It's a piece of loot.
---
Sure it's BiS, sure I'll roll need, obviously. But at the end of the day I have a lot more in life to think about than whether hunter clicks need or not lol.
---
You can't prop up prebis lists as gospel everyone should let Warriors rule everyone with and then be pissy about that.
---
I don't know why the fuck a Hunter would want Dal'Rends, but its on a lot of our prebis lists. Brainlessly following lists is a cancer unto itself.
---
&gt; if it exists ingame then it's legitimate gameplay.
---
Never said that.
---
In my experience no. On my server forums back in vanilla there would be a daily thread from Horde complaining about bg Qs with wait times over an hour.
---
Makes me wonder, is it annoying or interesting. Id imagine i'd wish to have been a part of it.
---
Make it your goal to get them 305 skill is so important. Dont know how much you play, but lets say you dedicate 25% time to farming send that gold to a bank alt and keep doing it till you got them.
---
Epitome of a low effort meme
---
&gt; About 3 hours and our record is rag at 2% by the end of phase one
---
Sounds like the rest of your guild is pretty far away from having any grounds to require warriors to not be Arms. My guild downs rag in a little over 2 min total and we clear MC and Ony together while memeing and gambling in under 2.5 hours. Most of our DPS warriors run as Arms because MC doesn't need to be that crazy strict unless you're pushing for clear speed.
---
Exactly. Wow Classic is vanilla 15 years later. People are older and have responsibilities. 
---
As such, getting 40 people together for raiding can be challenging. We got shit to do lol
---
Yeah there are a bunch of people way smarter who know that most of us plebs just follow the next next next post of these auction mods, they can then deliberately manipulate the market prices to do exactly this.
---
All it takes is 5 seconds of due diligence on your end to find this out and not get ripped off. It sucks but you'll learn :)
---
Is this a joke i am too much horde to understand?
---
I'm not sure what to think when someone tells me a 15 minute queue will drive people crazy.
---
Anyway 10-15min queue will be the norm. That's how it has always been ever since cross realm got introduced.
---
Really? My favorite raid tank of ours is a druid
---
Did you actually watch the video lol?
---
this didnt work. any ideas?
---
Have her try dw. I leveled deep prot n while sword n board is nice dw was faster n felt better than running 2h
---
After our first take down of Rag, my guild broke out the logs. It was the first time I had seen all the metadata behind raid-combat in all of its glory. I took one look at it, and......got extremely depressed. Thats when I realized there's no mystery to this game, theres not even much it any ambiguity. It's just a giant math equation and either you and your guildies are good at math or you arent.
---
Sure I get that but do you get why someone would not want to play a game where they have corpse run for 30-50 minutes to get to a dungeon? 
---
Oh and that dungeon is the only thing they can do in that game that doesn't involve 70% of their time spent corpse running.
---
Just a few paladins can blanket the whole raid.
---
Exactly why we kicked the hunter. Dalrends are only prebis because of Agility enchant, and that's not out for several phases. Till then you're much better off with a 2H, and there are only 2 other hunters in our raid, both of whom are decked out. He would be first in line for Rhok Delar, and after he's raided with us for a few weeks we would have given mats. Instead he decided to roll on something that's a much bigger upgrade for a different class without thinking about why it's on the list. His presumable use would just be to bank it till the enchant comes out, and he was willing to deny a warrior Dal'Rend set right now for that. Glad he showed his true colors early than late. If you don't know why you want gear, you shouldn't be rolling for it over someone else who can use it better.
---
&gt; There is virtually never a time where Regrowth is efficient
---
I've always assumed the efficiency is misleading due to the crits, with Imp Regrowth talent and appropriate gear you would have ~60% crit chance. Maybe that is already factored in though. 
---
If you went that build the best thing would probably be to continue HT spam on raid, but with DR Regrowth on tanks and then subsequent super fast HT on the raid. Who knows if it actually works.
---
And...that's how it's done!
---
Platform 9 3/4 .
---
My bad man no need to get angry with me I just appreciate the insanely high skill cap of lock
---
Either way, downranking is not needed. I feel like this discussion is based off of a desire for mechanics that used to matter but just don't right now. Game knowledge is adaptive and you use the right tool for the right job in the present and right now as Priests the two tools are Flash Heal and Shield.
---
I guess if we are talking LBRS or UBRS or other dungeons than sure, but not MC.
---
Hi, /u/chemicalthinking
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e5ra6u/am_i_allowed_to_promote_my_guild_here_i_sent_a/). 
---
The worst part of all is most people know little more than what the BIS list tells them to equip.     
---
I was just arguing with a hunter that thought he should be able to get band of accuria, because it was on his bis list.
---
either play the game or don't
---
watch asmon or don't
---
Don’t you get accommodation marks that turn in for rep and xp? I coulda swore I leveled my druid (albeit slowly) nearly entirely on wsg and dungeons.
---
Using this to give someone DHKs is actually griefing. Farming honor is not. I'd also call it an exploit.
---
deleted but up on newsweek /souljah boi
---
Nope not really they used a cheeky non intended way of an item to get results that shouldnt be there.
---
While I agree that if everyone is chasing optimized bis gear, a hunter should be going for barb blade/peacemaker over Dal'rends, this seems like an awfully childish and petty reaction to an inoffensive action that only emerged because of your own lack of consistency in loot  rules.  
---
If you're not trying for BIS on everyone on your guild, then that hunter has a right to roll on Dal'rends if it is an upgrade for him because denying someone an upgrade solely because he has the CHANCE to get something better later on is ridiculous.  
---
If you *are* trying  for BIS and attempting to be competitive, then it's both ridiculous that your UBRS runs aren't operating under master loot and that you're denying that the hunter has a right roll on something that is literally on his BIS list while asking for him to get BIS geared for raids.  Would be an especially egregious move to instantly gkick him and then actively ruin his experience if you didn't even tell him before the weapon dropped that he shouldn't roll on it and that he had alternatives that the guild was willing to help him farm.
---
Basically, that's not hunters being hunters -- it's your guild being awful at communicating.
---
Stoneform is 100000% better than Stun resist, Escape Artist is better than Stoneform.
---
Be realistic.
---
It means somebody meant to put 555g and they are extremely sad right now. As someone who made a similar mistake one time, make sure you guilt your friend.
---
Trying to force DHKs on people for simply farming honor isnt PvP its griefing.
---
Hey Nv!! I lol'ed. Ackaly.
---
Basically this though and including myself. We used to all play elves and now we’re playing orcs.
---
This is the Horde entrance to Warsong Gulch, located in the Northern edge of The Barrens.
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
It's 100% not available til level 34 because it was one of the few quests I remembered and kept tabs on every time I went into that part of SW since I'm a priest.  Doable at 34 but I'd think you need to be a healer to get brought along into Cathedral that low.  Also the skeletons you gotta kill in Desolace are like 38-39.
---
While I still wanted Questie to keep myself from going insane, I felt like I was just staring at the minimap instead of experiencing the world. Turning off the minimap icons still allowed for some direction without sacrificing the visual immersion.
---
To be fair, this is griefing, and "Pvp happend on a pvp server" is genuinly what happens when people are crying
---
Thankfully Im leveling an alt and not ranking atm
---
Just my personal opinion, thought it could help
---
I don't get these posts. No one takes the No path expecting to make it, you do it because the graveyard is right next to it and even with more deaths it's faster in the end.
---
On most servers the green paths also has epic mounts running around and you just end up with a couple fewer deaths but with a lot longer path to run (both alive and dead)
---
People still clicking in 2019?
---
It’s funny to me cause back in vanilla I ranked casually on Warsong to about 9 playing with our GM group playing around my guild’s raid times. although getting a spot in the first place took networking they were some pretty damn chill dudes and I was like 13 or 14 at the time. Not even sure if one guy could speak English past enough to follow directions cause he was definitely a Russian dude with multiple people playing his account
---
Of course we still dodged the HWL group for efficiency’s sake but the exception of the crazy Russian dude looking to hit R14 twice on the same character, so long as you kept to the proper order, everyone was pretty cool. I think R12+ was in the 250-300k honor a week range on the lower end idk how that compares to PServer/classic competition though. I’m guessing it’s way more cutthroat especially now with how good that gear is (my guild were already in AQ40+)
---
2-3 months? More like 2-3 weeks in MC, if that. All the hunters I know are geared out, even the alts, cause no one plays hunter. It would not be a very long wait at all for that guy. If he weren't 60 then he would literally only wear it till he jumps in raids then get rid of it.
---
Then you have warriors who farm SGC for hundreds of runs because it's an irreplaceable item for several phases. Very selfish if you ask me, and I don't even play Warrior. I've done so many arena runs for my friends, and we have a warrior who is 300+ runs dry. Just a matter of planning and consideration, some people care about others and some don't
---
It's probably worth trying.  There is enough anecdotal commentary on the forums to make me believe that it works, I'm just not seeing the math on it. 
---
I give alot of credence to Taladril and his guidance was against regrowth builds, but that might just be his opinion. 
---
Right now I'm top 2 healing overall with just HotW/NS, so I haven't been forced to choose yet.
---
Why type 10 paragraphs and 5+ posts when 4 sentences do trick?
---
No but seriously people underrate Shamans in PvP. Their group utility is for sure more limited than Paladin's but I have a feeling once those chain lightning crits start flying in BGs and people get kited/interrupted with shocks on a 6sec cooldown it's going to bring some vintage 2005 salt right back.
---
Let's not forget the that Alliance were the most vocal in vanilla about Shamans being OP. Paladins also aren't the auto win support everybody makes them out to be- it takes a pretty good player to be a good difference making Paladin. 
---
The amount of blessings and other skills to use when in combat is actualy insane. Knowing when and how to use them takes a lot of practice and understanding. And it's all for nothing in the end when a Shaman runs in and purges the fuck out of everybody.
---
I like the way the title has absolutely nothing to do with the post.
---
Clearly there is some passion behind your words but.... uhg.
---
And now you want changes, nope not gonna happen. Bgs wont be played cause of this. the meta will shift to tiny deathsquads. Camping every inch of the game but gj you fed some peeps some dhks.
---
After reading these comments I feel like I’ve missed out on something special by not meeting Nithore. The world needs more champions like him.
---
There is good reason my vanilla friends list wasn't big.
---
I feel the same way.
---
I am also annoyed at how much my wife relies on GPS directions to find the "best" route, even if she's just driving home.
---
Sometimes I take different routes. It might take me an extra few minutes sometimes, but it is often a more enjoyable drive.
---
Aww, if only your interpretation skills were any better, maybe you would have understood this comment, or the meme for a fact :)

Isn’t that every game ever though?
---
What's not fun about having the best gear you can get? Even if I have to farm it I have fun doing so. I *finally* got the Gloves of Power from LBRS and I was pretty excited.
---
His community force him onto a server, Force him to take drama bait, Force him to take responability of a servers success and failure. The man just reacts to videos and hosts mount/transmog comps.

If you are playing a server just because of a content creator to snipe/play with its your actions that will cause the success or failure of the server not his lol

---
The lobotomizer also takes one of the 32 raid debuff slots that are available to your raid. That alone should disqualify the item.
---
So now you know how it's been reading this sub with around 7 million posts of alliance crying.
---
What? Everyone is in charge of their own BiS list and understanding why they want the items. The fact that he didn't even research his own itemization thoroughly is reason enough to gkick him...
---
U can just bmah them tho, so same price either way
---
Can run RFD with disenchanting if your shards sell well on your server.
---
Ok zoomer
---
I had no choice. 
---
Shaman only horde :)
---
Mostly because those of us who didn't play on private servers are playing vanilla for the first time in years.  So we are going slower, taking in the sights, enjoying the journey.  Private server players are just rushing to 60.  They've done their nostalgia trip already.
---
“Fuck you mountain, I’ll fly how I want! Bitch!!!”
---
hey! glad it made you chuckle, these downvotes/dislikes are getting out of hand
---
Those lists on the web *are* "just wrong" if they are telling you to go over 6% hit for pre bis gear. Yes, exactly 6% hit *is* optimal for prebis gear (and getting at least 305 weapon skill so that 6% is the yellow hit cap on a raid boss). There is no ambiguity about this at all. Drop the hit to get more valuable stats.
---
Its good for soloing Maraudon for gold.
---
Want a medal of hate-er?
---
Where's the backdoor entrance at? 🤔
---
That's exactly the point, dimwit.
---
Meeting up with a horde raid and trading HKs qualifies as the former.
---
No changes
---
yeah, some of them you cannot sell at all.
---
Yeah, but assuming you have the gold/time and you're on a class that benefits why not? What is the only thing dps really need to do in a fight? Parsing high is pretty much the only thing to aim for. Unless your goal is "clearing the content" (which is also helped by flaking)
---
&gt;You should play for fun
---
&gt;Unless your idea of fun is different than mine, then you should play according to my idea of fun
---
Theres Zandalar warlock NPCs in the game.  We used that reasoning to get them to allow paladins, but they wont add warlocks?  Also it's extremely odd that they have monks considering what they did to the pandaren in MoP.
---
Then it would just say "lanch day"
---
I care too much about continuity.
---
(but seriously, I _do_ think writers in general get too little credit, and its easy to come in after they've invented new stuff and point out little holes I could patch)
---
Had this happen the other day, the I was on the rut theran boat, just as I debarked, the menethil boat docked.  Felt like I was cheating.
---
Can you get DHKs in BGs?
---
Sounds like they need to play around it, then. PvP happened on a PvP server. Maybe play better so they don't need others to babysit them, also.
---
I don't think we can talk about selfish behavior when Warriors are eating up all Rogue/Druid/Hunter/Shaman gear on their way to DPSing while acting entitled to it and going apeshit when others get it.
---
This conversation only exists because the game was turned into a math simulator where you follow exactly planned steps at a certain time.
---
Yeah for sure.  It kind of annoys me how many world buffs my raid group likes to stack, especially when it comes with the tacit expectation for everyone to do the same.  What's the point of spending 30 mins doing a tribute run for buffs that will shave 5 mins off a clear time?  That's a net loss of time to me as a player.
---
Who cares. Way to over analyze someone's else's life and their choices. He owes us nothing. He plays the game and enjoys fucking around. Maybe you should do the same as well. It's not his fault 50 k people flock to watch his nonsense. How many essay writing crybabies do we have on here, like really.
---
Imagine being this dillusional.
---
You sure it can be opened via lockpicking? Brb rerolling horde rogue
---
"Theres people who spent 15 years theorycrafting and practising to become the best in their class and to squeeze every single bit of dps humanly and mathematically possible out of their character.
---
Then theres me who dont give 2 flying ducks and just play for fun.
---
Therefore the aforementioned players ruin the game because obviously someone who spent 15 years mastering a class gets a prio over someone who doesnt even care that much"
---
Your post in a nutshell
---
Top comedy mate
---
Top tier boe what a steal
---
Tell that to the tank in my guild using Quel serrar who bought edgemasters
---
Stun resist is far better than stoneform.
---
I don't think most people realize, this is not PvP raid its a MC raids trying to get to MC with world buffs active.
---
Horde doesn't form big pvp raids, most of hordes are there solo or or with friends. Big raids grants barely any honor, especially with so little alliance around. Thats why well coordinated Alliance 20 man can hold entrance to BRM for hours. 
---
Its not very useful for alliance because horde just run around everywhere else, but at least horde has to pay BRM tolls too.. sometimes.. and smaller.. but you know, its something..
---
lol @ everyone who thinks horde queues are only going to be 15 mins
---
get ready to check your watches in surprise
---
Lotus spawn timer was also lowered from 2hr to a range around 1hr when layers were removed. It was already impacted.
---
But no specific needs for swords so yay
---
Horde dont reserve the right to complain about being 'camped/ganked'. Just dont.
---
Don't AOE.  Single target only.
---
That's the hard counter to this.  Really not terribly difficult to figure out how to NOT hit someone in a game where like 75% of your abilities are single fucking target, is it?
---
And having slightly better racials doesn't make up for paladins being incredibly overpowered and 1v1's mean very little.
---
And they so smol
---
If it's not on your guild's BIS list for hunters, then your guild is either bad or misinformed.  Once P3 hits, Barb blade + agi enchant will give 20 less total attack power than Dal'rends with 2 agi enchants.  Is that 20 attack power worth more than having the weapon on a warrior?  Hell no.  But to say that it isn't BIS is completely wrong in a short period of time.  Your melee dps will eventually end up all replacing their dal mhs with brut blades, bres, and oebs while your hunters will be stuck with weapons inferior to what they could've had in the long term.  
---
Just kick all but 2 of your hunters and get it over with if you just want them there as trueshot bots, or stop pretending like not having full knowledge of all classic raid content is a crime worth a gkick.
---
With a bit of luck and cleverly arranging your loot table, you could wind up getting 10+ pieces before someone else got anything in this loot system. Loot council tends to be more fair.
---
Id say healing for 800-900 would be about right for your most common raid heal, assuming you're not on a tank assignment.
---
Pssst. Inv pots.
---
Video? The thing that's massively lacking right now is video proof from either side of this on the eye, yeti and target dummies.
---
Must be a visual bug.
---
A druid? Congrats on your full tier 1 set.
---
Will you run MC a second time?
---
Except that's not gonna happen....
---
As opposed to Warriors needing shit left and right having items on their BiS list that benefit 4 other classes?
---
I'm casual enough that I don't mindlesly obsess over these things but if there's one thing for sure it's that hardcore obsession with BiS lists and players pushing others around them down for better loot won't be good for the long term health of the game.
---
It's been 15 years and many bumps and a lot of you still don't see why we ended up with personal loot in retail.
---
I camp hordies at the road to dire maul. You have no idea how many corpse ress on their corpse. While i am just standing there in full view, instead of on the bridge so they can jump off or ress while jumping. I see mages nova me and stand still next to me casting frostbolt. Warlocks spamming fear over and over. Lots of people have 0 clue how to pvp or escape pvp
---
They just need to open paid realm transfers and get it over with. Even I'm tired of this world pvp bullshit. Let us pay for our mistake and move on. The only reason I joined a pvp server in the first place is because my retail guild went there but now that they've all stopped playing classic I dont want to stay anymore. I hate attacking low level defenseless players and I hate being a target for alliance looking for easy honor. I don't need to add meaningless dishonorable kills to that list as well just because some asshole I group with cant control himself.
---
Sure. That's why on pserver duel tournaments, people prefer undead/orc over gnome/dwarf. Because they're unrealistic.
---
Most people who are ‘overwhelmingly crushing the minority faction’ really just want to play the game, have a little fun pvping, and keep up with honour but are unfortunate enough to be on an unbalanced server. Running a few people over in a huge group isn’t any fun either. It’s definitely a little less shitty than DKing bombing people. I don’t care either way though, call me when Warsong’s out.
---
You clearly playing horde. I have a game I play daily, "How long does it take for Denworath to reach DME today". Both of the closest FP are camped, ship in feralas camped, both sidea of the road are camped, then the entrance has 2-3 separate zugzugs camping it. You think im joking or that this is massive exaggeration but i assure you it isnt.
---
&gt;I actually like to see the mage drink, while the warrior/priest/rogue/other proceed to 3-man the next engagement and the mage joins when ready.
---
This is the best way to do it but the mentioned problems arise; Mages get antsy at half mana and start attacking instead of finishing drinking and healers often get passive aggressive and let you die as the tank and then smugly tell you to let them drink.
---
Ultimately I feel that the only people having fun are the DPS. Maybe a good healer likes all the damage coming in with the artificial challenge introduced, but as a tank the fun for me is controlling the mobs. Oversealous Mages playing like they are solo grinding and pulling agro leaves me doing little and I don't have the option of letting Mages die like a healer does because the second threat target is the healer. All I can do is pool rage to save the Mage when they go OOM with ancillary abilities; Taunt, Mocking Blow, Demo Shout, Thunder Clap and Piercing Howl.
---
We mostly agree :)
---
It was 2hr during layering
---
Poo reck when she lands.
---
What I’m rocking right now is my dungeon grinding setup and has me at  just under 5k hp and about 375 SP (i think) unbuffed. Not a BiS list but decent stats and a good indicator.

OH - Fire ruined grimoire (when not using Spell stone I’d probably go for the skeleton book from Ony for pvp though).
---
Trinkets - Reed + DM trinket...loads to choose from for pvp but from raid content ToEP would be awesome.
---
I wouldn’t personally count on having two VW up for pvp encounters since it has an hour long cd
---
You're not going to be melee'ing much other than to Wing Clip, and you do absurd damage at 19 thanks to Venomstrike, so I think you're overthinking it. I suggest checking out xpoff.com and seeing what they have to say.
---
Try transferring and actually play the game. I corpse walked about ten times on the day of wpvp and transferred right after.
---
Not in a true sense, addons can only modify existing plates and there's no player nameplate.
---
You can move a regular frame styled like a nameplate above your character, since it's always in the same place. Most unit frame addons can be configured like what you have on that screenshot, idk about combo points though.
---
Why are you obsessed with bis lists? Surely you can see that your gear needs change as your other gear develops or content patches come out?
---
For hunters dual dal'rends is bis for phase 1, 2 and especially so in phase 3 (assuming they don't have access to brutality/CHT)
---
I had VERY different dreams when I was 15......
---
Boobs.
---
Love advertise but sadmongold got him banned , a great injustice has been served
---
If you leave a shammy alone u get 4k crits to the face ofc u die first and 2nd
---
Any timestamps or anything? Its quite a long video and i'd rather skip to parts.
---
Gnome is the best overall. 1 min CD to break out of a root is too good and you get Paladins.
---
Stun Resist is cool for grenades and some matchups, but I still prefer Blessing of Freedom and Escape Artist.
---
Months of being stomped due to numbers, being told to reroll or quit- being unable to do anything in the world. Rerolling would be a waste of hundreds if not thousands of hours of grinding at this point- and Horde have made it clear they want Alliance to quit, they're happy Alliance aren't having a good time; heck, I've seen multiple threads where Horde say farming honour is no different from farming any mob in the game. Horde players consider Alliance players to be the same as bits of data.
---
Horde players look at Alliance and see at best pixels to farm ruthlessly, or at worst someone to cause suffering to.
---
If this works, and it can cause players like these to lose days or weeks of their time- good, they gloated about doing the exact same. The Horde has made it abundantly clear they view pvp as the means to cause suffering to other human beings trying to enjoy a hobby- if that's how it has to be, they wanted this.
---
Lol welcome to Wow classic! People bragging that they got one level during broken ass wpvp. Lmao y’all legit need some corpse running guides. 
---
Have to hide from the game just to play it. Fucking weird.
---
I'm a simple man. I see asmonchild,  I downvote
---
Lmaooooooo
---
They weren’t offering this to just anybody. The people getting it already had full gladiator gear but wouldn’t be able to make gladiator themselves. 
---
I know they got multiple people the merciless netherdrake this way. IIRC blizzard may have made changes with vengeful gladiator that made it harder to sell rank.
---
&gt; But to restrict someone from raiding because they are missing 1 piece that literally doesn’t make a difference when it come to how well you can play your class vs +2 in a single stat? That’s just some shit.
---
I have 3 60's, raided with 5 different guilds, and done countless pugs already with my alts.
---
At no point have I ever heard anything remotely close to the bullshit you outlined above. I haven't even heard anyone gatekeep in any fashion AT ALL, let alone for gear.
---
no on some servers it's actually that bad.. humans can adjust for campers. a bot cannot
---
Lmao you must be a great player and asset to your guild lmao
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
1) More people clearing raids = more people pvping.  We have thousands of people who now only need a few pieces of gear, but can only raid once a week. So those players now spend a lot of their time they previously used running dungeons and finishing chain quests for specific gear doing pvp instead. 
---
2) Flawed honor system. It's not flawed due to our knowledge, but the flaws are exaggerated now due to how much we know as opposed to before. Without BGs the easiest way to farm honor is camp fps, boats/zeppelins, run in 5-10 man deathballs, and patrol areas filled with 48-52s leveling. Most of us were still figuring out a lot of the game back then, and didn't think about spending hours a day doing those things. There was definitely people who did it back then, but it wasn't groups of 20+ doing it everyday. We did have Thottbot but that was filled with a lot of rumours and inaccurate information.
---
We now have a lot of bored people on imbalanced servers with nothing better to do than grief players for a couple honor points.
---
Get used to it 🙂
---
At least its moving could be the vanilla glitch of just staying put
---
I know that titan plate shows your gold per session and exp per session but idk about the others
---
Speaking personally, I don't like them as they provide roughly similar DPS to a mage or a rogue, but way less utility.
---
Also, they have the same issues as Enhancement shaman, as anyone who deliberately chooses the least group-friendly spec is probably only interested in how they go personally.
---
So. Yeah. Won't take em if I have a choice.
---
Such an original post
---
I see people advertising Felcloth for 2-3g~ and Mooncloth transmutes for 5g (Mooncloth is a bit more expensive) so it sort of matches what you get on your server.
---
It might be due to a lot more people with 300 tailoring compared to Vanilla, feels like half the mages these days have 300 tailoring and Robe of the Archmage by the time they hit 60.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Same in Skeram, predictably. The camping and grieving was bad enough that I thought it couldn’t get much worse. I was, of course, wrong.
---
Man, I have a 31 hunter I'm thinking about re-rolling because I've gone off the hair colour and style (mostly because 2H/long hair clipping drives me bonkers). It's not that big a deal- if you're not having fun then don't throw good time after bad in the hopes you *might* start having fun at some point
---
Meta
---
I’ve just moved forward without dwelling on it. Honestly leveling pvp prior to the honor system was awesome, but I understand that was just a phase (as it was in vanilla) and I’m fine changing with the times. I will say, I enjoy leveling on my PvE server flagged for pvp most the time!
---
You legit want classic to die huh? Blizzard audience truly is rock bottom
---
Just relog after you zone into IF. Then you lose your pvp status lmao
---
Yang = cancer
---
Yea I've no idea why it posts it as emote instead of your own chat. Makes no sense.
---
Unless it’s Tuesday night.
---
Wailing caverns final boss would have to be a rideable murloc
---
Legends speak of a time where suddenly mooncloth prices spiked. When was this? Well they say it involved blood magic and lots of trolls.
---
Well Fel Dom is a 15min CD. Wouldn't be every fight if you're constantly PvPing, but would be up if you're infrequently attacked while farming.
---
This post is cringy af
---
It's literally not possible. My guild isn't farming MC to the point where the boots for me would be a priority, and as far as I can tell no guilds are currently selling them
---
Not sure, I saw someone post a screenshot of taking a DHK from it so I assumed it was legit.
---
Maybe it was removed because it promoted a potential exploit.
---
I wanted to roleplay as a dual wielding axe dwarf while doing pve so I bought this. Love them.
---
No need to project this much my dude.
---
Just re roll on a PVE server.
---
It never was 2 hours
---
Why not an actual boat? That would be a neat solution to horde camping Theramore-Menethil one.
---
I’m not. I’m fine with a pvp server. I was just commenting on the “fair fight” point.
---
Same on Lucifron. I'll just save them for the tailoring recipes when ZG gets released.
---
Show us on the doll where the guild leader touched you.
---
You shall hereby be known as "Devilsaur Slayer" in honor of taking a route to victory akin to the greatest hero of our time: Goblin Slayer
---
I noticed this druid posting to LFG, and wondered how many tanks would have ignored it. After all, if you put the word tank in your name, haven't you set yourself up for that role?
---
Lesson: be a bit more creative with your name and don't lock yourself into a role. I think it goes a long way towards whether people will take you seriously or not.
---
They aren't strengths that have no counter, it's the combination of all factors that make Paladin healers strong in PvP.
---
You can take anyone of their strengths and say "Well X is useless when you have Y" but the fact is all of them thrown together on one spec, taking up one spot in a premade is a decent advantage.
---
I spam "i b u r n  ti r e s" to the " o k b o o m e r" turds.  
---
HOW DARE YOU
---
The BiS lists and knowledge is fine to me, but I find the toxic attitude people have is a bit much. For example...
---
As a priest I’m trying to get the full devout set before I enter MC. I know it’s not the best and I couldn’t care less, I’m doing it for the nostalgia and because I want to do it! But even if I form my own UBRS group, I get so much drama when I say we are going to do father flame. All I ever hear is “no that’s a massive waste of time, let’s just do Jed/rend and reset”.
---
What happened to just playing the game for fun, why does there always have to be a goal achieved other then enjoying your time. It wasn’t like this back then.
---
Fairbanks has an alliance guild that runs 1pm server time which is pst but we are really imbalanced but it's not as bad as they say other then brm which is usual hell.
---
Auctionneer felt very off to me in its prices calculations. I used it for over a month (and years before classic) but switched to TSM. And boy, it's a million times better to estimate prices and post stuff (it defaults by undercutting 1 copper)
---
Noticed this too. Happens since a week or so.
---
Obviously I can't speak for others, but i've personally un-subbed (playtime expiers in ~4 days) and stopped playing. I might as well be given the option to transfer to PVE because there's no way i'm re-rolling.
---
But why would you believe that they explicitly intended this interaction when you admit they didn't explicitly intend all of those others? This seems even more dubious an assumption than claiming they intended, say, light of elune to be used in massive world pvp battles to give the alliance army a guaranteed edge, or any of the others I suggested before.
---
What do you think makes Horde more desirable in TBC? Arena?
---
That's the server I wanted from the start. I want RP, damn me for following my friends.
---
classic wow
---
&gt; The punishment for not being ~~on time to~~ logged out at MC is repeated corpse walks into BRM.
---
So much yikes in such a short video.
---
To quote others: "Imagine being butthurt over PvP happening on a PvP server"
---
Fuck asmonchild
---
This is an old myth, the level of agility required is around 1000 and you still need a Hunter giving you trueshot. It's essentially a selfish spec and the loss of dps from other physical damage from the lack of your true shot off sets any personal dps.
---
I have always wondered what leveling with slam was like, but end of the day, it's not just 5 talent points, it's a complete respec out of sweeping strikes just to try it. 
---
I also wish improved sunder was higher up in the prot tree, so that there was some possible way to level as prot and not have it be absolutely worthless. To be clear, it is, but I can't help but think "improved sunder armor is actually not a bad talent while soloing".
---
The difference being, running a few people over in huge groups happens over and over and over, and those people cannot even play the game. Someone getting a DHK doesn't do that. It just makes leveling their PvP rank a little slower. They still get to drop their AOEs with their other 13 mages on the 3 man group of level 48's as much as they want.
---
Back in vanilla I stopped using benediction in PVP because I felt like it stood out too much and made me and easier target, used some random blue staff and I swear I got targeted less. 
---
In that situation though you should have people peeling for you, either polymorph, Frost nova, entangling roots, blind. People need to keep you alive as much as you need to keep them alive.
---
So you think you should be able to level with impunity from pvp interaction and not have to use your brain to come up with a plan that puts you in a favorable position to not encounter people that can easily kill your character? If only there was a specific server to fulfill this need. Come on bro...
---
CAREBEARS..... STARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
My outlaw rogue on retail is running around with thunderfury's already so uh... I can imagine it.
---
Gotta agree, roll pvp, suffer the consequences. Instead of bs'ing in this thread and crying, just reroll like a lot of ppl do and enjoy the game...
---
Go holy with spirit tap and meditation. You have some kind of damage and to have spirit tap with spiritual guidance with spirit and damage gear, you should be fine.
---
Not during Feign Death?
---
The end of the video literally says that its 3 raid groups.
---
&gt;  Arcane Shot
---
No
---
Or on acid...
---
If your guild clears mc super easy and kill rag before submerge why shouldn’t you play arms?. I do 5-600 dps single target with full consumes and wf(no ony/rend/dm buff) playing arms with OEB. There’s no need to min max try hard in mc if you’re already breezing through it. Save that for bwl and onward. If your RL is fine with it, arms in p2 is the optimal spec if you want to pvp too and not get bored to death with fury thats underwhelming in pvp. Of course Fury dw&gt;fury 2h&gt;arms in raidpve, but don’t listen too much too the tryhards, if you’re not struggling it’s fine
---
Casters are typically my favorite to kill because they have low HP and low armor. Having an interrupt/stun can basically lock them out from spellcasting for 5+ seconds making it much easier to keep your HP up.
---
I was looking for this, thank you
---
Bad bot
---
If all it does is rez as close as possible to MC, maybe it means it doesn't move while alive and people just... left the naked gnome alone.
---
Depends on your server. On the mega high pop PvP servers, Horde massively outnumber Alliance. On my server (Earthfury) Alliance has about a 60/40 population advantage. Though I think Horde are a bit more active when it comes to PvP so it’s really quite even.
---
Battles at Kargath typically go as follows: A large Alliance contingent camps Horde in Kargath. Horde gather in the hut and come out every so often to poke, but have to stay surrounded by civilians for safety. Eventually over time, more and more Horde fly into town to reinforce the defenders, and at a certain point their numbers become significant enough that they can fight back.
---
Here’s where it gets real interesting. The Horde will usually split the Alliance force in half, as there is an eastern and a southern canyon entrance to the town. Once this happens, it’s over. Alliance are now split into two groups and begin to drop like flies. The Horde remains a large singular group, hunting down fleeing Alliance. Eventually the Alliance group up and run back through the canyon to Searing Gorge, but by this point they start to receive reinforcements as well.
---
Here’s where you never know what’s gonna happen. I’ve seen it go both ways, either Horde roll through and stomp the Alliance, or the Alliance hold their ground, wipe the Horde, and go back to camping Kargath while stragglers get picked off. Usually the latter takes place, but I’ve seen the Horde win a few of these big battles.
---
Checking in to read the irrational reddit "I hate all streamers" rage.
---
Supply and demand
---
Well obviously not, but I don’t think I need to waste my time arguing with one person on why the game is in a horrible state right now and is losing people because of it.  Not to mention the imbalance that is getting even worse everyday, but aye Pvp On A PVP SeRveR RIghT?!? there’s no high or low, it’s all the same lmao.
---
You’re wrong. People should care exactly as much as they want to about whatever.
---
Private servers mashed all players together. If you look at classic as a whole, two factions are pretty balanced, but a lot of alliance is concentrated on a few servers (especially pve ones).
---
Marvelous, I love bugs like that, there's something eerie about them.
---
Imagine the people in IF that just see a grpyhon and rider fly through the walls for a second and then disappear.
---
You're probably a Feral and only do single target dps anyway ;)
---
Same as me, it doesn't affect me since I don't mindlessly AoE everything around.
---
Idk about 18-20 but around like 24-28 the charred vale is great. Those harpies respawn fast af, drop grey weapons that vendor for like 20-40s a pop, drop cloth that can be auctioned, and there’s elementals to farm that have expensive stuff you can auction too. I got the idea of grinding there after seeing all the Chinese bots do it.
---
Ssshhh it's okay bb
---
Don't stare me down ya carebear!
---
Probably because it's a counter to all the defending of 70:30 server imbalances that advocate for zerging groups of 5 man level 48's parties with 63 character deathballs. Nova's and blizzards everywhere might not be so beneficial now.
---
You're right, it's not going to be 15, it'll be 5 minutes.
---
Alright thanks for the advice!
---
You should follow your own advice and see that the scores he's talking about are NORMALIZED, meaning everything you just said is completely irrelevant. *Normalized*, you probably have no idea what that means though so keep being uneducated and living in your own little bubble.
---
would be so easy, everything u buy from the AH is bind when pickup. Problem solved
---
It’s in exactly the state everyone with common sense or private server experience figured it would considering the population. I would just move on if I were you, honestly. What’s the point of playing if every interaction warrants reddit complaints. This subbredit genuinely has like 1/100 posts with actual insightful material or mechanic discussion, it’s a giant collection of Debbie Downers LOL
---
Maybe if you are a dps warrior, but probably not.
---
Looks like people being mad about PvP.
---
Go play fortnite if you want to be a carebear
---
People who want to farm efficiently are going to be playing WSG in premades, and finish the games in 3-5 minutes. So yeah, they'll be able to head to kargath once per hour, and will maybe have the time to reach BRM before getting the next game.
---
Who 👏 the 👏 fuck 👏 cares 👏 about 👏 twitch 👏 drama?
---
Ok didnt expexted that. take a upvote!
---
You can wait until she fireballs everyone with few people in the raid.
---
The asspain in this comment section is hilarious.
---
Just make something else. Clearly you’ve got the mats
---
But the server structure which is at fault for these server issues is a change......
---
If only blizzard make a proper ah interface to begin with.... Ah is near un usable without some kind of addon so sort though stuff.
---
Bloodfang is currently like this.
---
I mean, he is a druid
---
That is incorrect, because even when you put on healing gear (gain +healing) the heal over time effect remains the same.
---
It's a textbook version of snapshotting, it snapshots your stats at the point of equipping the sword and gaining the invisible aura, not every time you change gear.
---
Probably not, because the classic client is created to run smoothly with tons of sharding and layering, which we no longer have.
---
oh right, yeah dont worry horde! queues will be instant for sure!  keep rolling horde, no problems at all xDd
---
Make them all the same name with ascii characters so you never know which one has bubble on CD lol
---
&gt;and use the Healthstone CD timer.
---
and mana gem :(
---
I've wanted to make an enhance tank since BC
---
If you get knocked you lose aggro, simple as that. You can save it once by fast stance dancing and intercepting, but it's going to be on cd the next time. Getting fire resist cap means you resist 75% of his knockbacks.
---
ah you're horde on a 80/20 server, gotcha
---
I play a healer, so we almost always roam in a small group (4-8ish, usually closer to 4). I personally strongly dislike camping, for a lot of reasons, but especially for lowbies. Even for people at level, if you camp them and prevent them from regrouping, they'll just leave. Give people a chance to get back on their feet and you get more fights out of them. They're there for honour, too.
---
Nah, alliance will have instant queues, whilst Horde have to wait 5 minutes. The overall population skew ain't that big, since PvE servers are included in the crosserver. 
---
Sorry to crush your dreams of revenge through waiting.
---
So a backup weapon for when you are oom and in melee range? Sure why not.
---
It's not revenge if you don't actually hit the person who wronged you. Aiming your machine gun into a crowd because your childhood bully might be in there is insanity, not revenge.
---
750 on my server....XD
---
So it's still up to the honor campers to kill the random newcomers from the opposing factions, right?  IE, if my Alliance companion doesn't kill the other random horde, then I lose honor, while they can still solo farm it since there's currently no other alliance competition in that area?
---
Outrun melee classes.
---
"farming honor" by corpsecamping someone after spirit rez isn't griefing? Yeah, sure.
---
Depends on how u play. Ally and horde have different objectives in battlegrounds. Horde can burst better cause shamans one shot people. While ally can hold forever cause pally don’t go oom.
---
Honestly how could anyone not run minor speed?
---
Pvp server
---
All hunter weapons
---
Horde dominated cross-servers. Horde players have better access to ressources on Open World than the opposite faction (easier to gear up).
---
I don't know it, but I think I maaay have figured it out with the number and disposition of letters. Does it start with a N?
---
?????
---
"Too low, terrain. PULL UP!"
---
My favorite trick was warlock portal summoning horse to Nagrand, on top of the flying mountains, but placing the portal over open air...
---
Hey man, some of us use Corruption too. No hate.
---
Blood elves
---
Nice pvp set
---
I think people on here are overreacting a bit to how bad it is. It does suck getting ganked, but I just swap characters when I have a hard time on one.
---
Grobbulus is essentially 50/50
---
Follow me on this:
---
- Blizzard released very few severs (indicating that populations on each server were gonna be high)
---
- Content creators prior to Classic release said that Phase 2 was gonna be wild, filled with massive griefing, flight point camps etc.
---
- People were given 3 months of prep to prepare the ultimate slaughterhouse.
---
All of this information was available to everyone before Classic release, and everyone could make the decision on which server type to roll on. I can't feel bad for anyone. If the PvP servers are too hard for you, then go play on a PvE server. Yes your character is "lost", but if you truely enjoy every other aspect other than WPvP then I don't see how it could be a big problem.
---
ZG bloodvine set
---
No, usually it's the other way, they have the buyer list something for a high price and buy it
---
Yes, but you will be saved to that Molten Core ID. If you have already killed a boss in MC that reset, you will not be able to enter.
---
If it wasn't for this add-on, cursedforge would just be called forge.
---
Because it's the best boot enchant, period.
---
It's interesting.  I played Horde in Vanilla.  I was 19.  And the joke was always that kids played Alliance which is why the Alliance always lost in PvP.  And here I am again, playing Horde and now I'm seeing jokes about how it's "kids" playing Horde again.
---
JuSt GeT t3
---
With that said, the earth shock does have high threat but it could be switched to a taunt and no or reduced damage, the stone skin can change to  damage reduction. You got me in the mana though
---
Buy it all up and save it for ZG
---
Horde filth spreading disinformation
---
That means your team sucks dick / your positioning is really bad. Also if you get jumped by melees you can just pop a LIP and those 6 seconds should be more than enough for your group to peel for you.
---
Getting a Dragon chainbody drop from them will be a nice cash boost aswell
---
Why?
---
It's because it's 2.0 speed
---
The fastest path is a straight line.
---
All this guy had to do was fear and mana burn.
---
&gt;Bless me priests for I have sinned against my fellow horde.
---
skinned against my fellow horde.
---
Have you played retail recently, that stuff is out before launch, in order to preserve mystery they would have to not have any form of external or ptr testing, which could be risky as we wouldnt be able to provide any feedback before launch. If it is on ptr then guides would be out before launch, just like retail.
---
Nope, guy is an idiot. I greatly enjoyed pvp before p2, it was actually a coin toss on whether horde were friendly or not, and if they were then it led to some pretty fun interactions.
---
Rest in peace little gnome boi.
---
Depends on the spec. I’ve killed T3 geared players in Sl/Sl using only engi and trinkets, everything else was naked.
---
Also depends on those trinkets.
---
MR BEAKS WILD RIDE NEVER ENDS
---
That skybox is giving me some vapor wave  vibes
---
I have been playing a lot on retail and private server, and yes the queue will be way longer on horde than alliance (that the only reason I am alliance). That ratio dont mean anything because there is way much more horde players that are interested in pvp than alliance. I would say expect a 5 to 15 min queue for horde, when we will get instant queue.
---
Blizzard will just claim it wasn't this way back in 04-06 and change it if they feel it needs to be changed.
---
i see a gnome kill i upvote.
---
If my memory serves me right, did Hogger move to Stockades?
---
So much this. People just listen to min/max guides and bis lists  and are incapable of applying the logic used to make them in any other sense.
---
It's also the only way to get back to the entrance easily when you are doing dm east jump runs.
---
You can use the pouch at any lv.
---
Why flash heal 4? I'm using 5 atm because it gives a nice 8-900 heal which is about the damage of most MC mob swings.
---
Fair point. So what happens with out feedback?
---
Now if only I could get in some good fights! Tired of being on the receiving end of 5v1s on my way to Dire Maul or literally anywhere Eastern Kingdoms. I understand why they move as groups, just getting impatient for BGs though!
---
Lobo takes a debuff slot in raids- there's already so few and many vital debuffs. Basically- you can't use it in raiding. It's effectively a pvp, solo and dungeon weapon.
---
I have read several times in here that people farmed it and despite being able to wear cannot use the effect
---
It's max flash heal. Only one down ranked in Heal 2.
---
All spells cast on enemies have at least a 1% chance to resist, even at hit cap.
---
How are you playing where you haven't managed to get any pre raid BIS pieces? If you've got any variety in your dungeon running then surely you'd come across some. There's not a big gap between how people would normally play, and how you'd play if you're looking for BIS pieces. 
---
Sure you can contribute without the gear, but it's a bit of a slap in the face to expect the same treatment with Raid drops if you've put in far less effort than others to make the raid possible. Just join a guild thats on the same page as you - guilds are allowed to only recruit people who have put in the effort to get geared, it's unreasonable to guilt trip them into carrying players who haven't bothered to get decent gear.
---
It works lol. I just used mine.
---
Pretty sure you can use the on use effect of the pouch.. it was changed later to have a level requirement but if I'm not mistaken in vanilla you can use it.
---
I don’t know what kind of gps y’all use but mines updates in real time and changes to a route that’s quicker. That’s why we use the gps to avoid the congestion, any accidents or power outages.
---
The collective of players in the majority faction on their server forming raids and camping BRM entrance is who wronged him, not any individual player really. There's a chance he gets someone who didn't gank him in the past, but if they're there they're gankers and all deserve it, is probably the way he sees it.
---
If earth shock was a taunt, it would easily be the best taunt in the game. If they change the cooldown to be more taunt appropriate, shamans wouldn't have the threat mechanic required to keep aggro. Any changes to stoneskin or the like would significantly empower horde in PvE raid content.
---
I think it'd best be done with a shield enhance, 4th new shock to be a balanced taunt, and some kind of mana refund on damage taken.
---
But you quickly hit the reality that over-tuning shamans to make a solid all rounder tank class that can tackle its issues in classic also makes it stupid OP compared to warriors/druids. At least tank wise, classic is a bit of a mess with optimization.
---
I knew Druids were immune to Polymorph when shapeshifted, but I didn't know that they could still shift out of Poly when they're a sheep. It's a mistake every Mage makes once I suppose given how OP Polymorph is in literally every other PvP situation.
---
gonna be a lot of horde saying "let me in" on the 10th
---
What if that is the work he described
---
Thanks for clarifying.
---
How would talking about the mounts in each game on a post about adding mounts based on dungeon themes seem unrelated to you? This sub isn't the brightest lmao
---
It’s very important, especially for poison application.  Your mainhand strikes (sinister) are based off mainhand so u want the slowest highest damage. Your offhand needs to be fast to apply those poisons and get in those quick autos.
---
Thanks for the tips! I know I need hit gear, but as I'm lvl 45 at the moment there isn't a lot to be had. I understand about DWing needing more hit- but the offhand does still hit *sometimes* so it's more aggro than sword and board if I'm not worried about taking too much damage.
---
I'd love to raid tank and go full prot, but I'm skeptical about my chances of finding a guild that will let me. So I want a spec that will let me raid as DPS but still tank dungeons. Which I think I can do with a full-fury DPS build- but that's later's problem. Once I have gear. Now that I'm leveling and *don't yet* have the gear I'm wondering if I need to go half-prot to make up the difference.
---
I love how they bounce when they die
---
Why wouldn't it be allowed? Literally just someone killing mobs while you are in the same group as them. They already did a change to prevent you from being able to boost as easily compared to actual vanilla anyway
---
I'm only 33 but I've always been top dps so far.
---
I use ignite+corruption(gcd) then curse of agony.
---
I also have CoA set up with a macro to use amplify curse if its available since I'm lazy.
---
Ctrl v turns on nameplates that can make targeting easier but I use tab to shuffle through nearest enemy targets.
---
Dot up all the targets. Maybe use a lifetap if I'm full health and then wand. Reignite+corruption if its a boss or something and my dot wears off when mob still has half its health or so.
---
I use succubus pet that's usually around 30% of my damage.
---
I also like to keep strong troll blood potions up for faster hp regen.
---
&gt;You can also watch for green items that rolled the +healing stat on the auctionhouse. A 40-60 Healing isnt bad on a slot you have trouble to fill, only costs a few gold. I think its decent tradeoff in bracer, belt and helmet slot.
---
Never do this. Always get a blue item over a green. Stats &gt;&gt;&gt; green +healing items.
---
Pretty sure naxx private server got 1 million in a couple months which is why blizzard did classic.
---
A man can dream 😭
---
I don't think DWing affects your main hand's chance to hit. So I'm not sure why you seem to be saying that DW tanking will lower my aggro capability.
---
Depends on the heaters in your raid. Some teams will say yes, others will say no. Think of a flask like insurance to your own consumes.
---
You can say that again...
---
Don't have one either, but here are a few items in that level range for spell damage. Green Lens of Nature's Wrath, Wildthorn Mail, Earth Warder's Gloves, Ban'Thok Sash, Spellshock Leggings, and Band of the Unicorn x2.
---
You could go with a staff but I'd want a shield so Hypnotic Blade + Gizlock's Hypertech Buckler.
---
Fill in the rest with either Sta/Int gear of 'of Nature's Wrath.' There are a few more difficult items like the ring you get for saving the princess in BRD or Spirit of Aquementas.
---
Go Engineering for sure. Bombs, rocket helm, and death ray. You can even use the ice reflector.
---
? Max flash heal is 7
---
Because the mounts you're arguing against are not "meaningless shit you paid for".
---
https://ironforge.pro/
---
This is the closest thing you can get to an armory, it uses Warcraftlogs to gather people's info, so they have to have at least one log on there in order to be seen.
---
I already have the start of a tanking set while still in my low 40s, so I don't think I'll be completely bereft of all tank gear by mixing dungeons and questing.
---
You mean after BWL? T2 priest gear has less +healing than T1. Looks awesome though.
---
It was right then I knew
---
I fucked up
---
which class should i play if I want to rp a romantic swordsman hero?
---
Sure is. But I never said I down rank Flash Heal. I think you misread.
---
From what ive seen people say AV is alliance territory in classic.
---
Explain that second part lol cuz it makes no sense
---
For locations I know you have to discover Barrens, the bottom left town right as you enter ashenvale from barrens, westfall if youre horde, booty bay if you plan to go for AGM trinket, stonetalon if you want to get engineers cloak
---
Well that’s one way to get into Old Ironforge!
---
If someone is hitting my priest, I will poly them and ask the squad to collapse on them and burst them so the other healers can't respond... Having dead healers means you die next, so we usually prioritize saving our priests and shamans over finishing kills on enemy damage dealers. Our warriors get so mad when you touch their windfury bot (erm, shaman)
---
Remind me
---
Then you realize an offtank warrior could be doing this better than a shaman cause hamstring can proc nightfall and then you then realize that your useless.
---
Yes they are. They're like gun skins you can buy in CoD. Nobody cares how flashy it is. It's meaningless because it took nothing to get it.
---
Should be 5 alliance players running out from the inn, otherwise it looked accurate
---
For horde the best lineup is:
---
1 druid fc ,2 disc
---
2 ele, 1 mage, 1 wl, 1 hunter
---
1 war, 1 rogue
---
2 eles is better vs good premades because of the way better burst than with 2 mages. 2 mages on horde isnt that good because allys will play with 2 palas and 1 disc so it will be hard to cc all 3 healers at the same time. Furthermore freedom/fap counters the slow/root from a mage rly hard.
---
What do you horde does? We have no fp out there
---
Shadow priest have advantage for the horde. Troll shield that can stun , and of course the famous UD disease. Plus you dont have to fight UD with the wotf. And you dont fight orc with their 25% stun resist. 
---
BUT
---
Alliance  = instant BG queue.
---
Could just roll on loot if people need it don’t gotta think so much it’s just a game
---
Make sure you start dungeon runs asap. Lvl 15 might be too late cause you never know the drops. Also having a main with money is extremely helpful and maybe find a twink guild that can help you out with runs and such
---
I wasnt even replying to the post anyways though I was replying to one comment on here. I jokingly said, "retail tried to be fun at the parties, look at it now" and people here took it personally.
---
Did you use the windows 10 game bar recoding feature?
---
Horde bad. 
---
Horde suffer
---
Lmao
---
Got confused, picked a PvE server and didn't look back.
---
Should've rolled on a PvE server. I dealt with this bullshit for a year before I had enough and rolled on one. Best decision I ever made.
---
So close
---
This is exactly what made retail what it is, this right here
---
And you wont believe how many druids sit in full sheep...even after 15 years!
---
I have a shaman that has the Skullflame Shield (not equipped yet). I have been trying to figure out if it is viable to aoe farm with a 0/20/31 build that basically aims at ultimate survivability...but I haven't found any answers. It would basically look like healing constantly while the shield does the work, but again I don't know how viable this would be.
---
Fuck yeah. Please provide screenshots.
---
Yea, I've always kinda questioned it too. What effect does this have on raid healers? With the loss of int/stam they will have to heal you a lot more. What about the loss of crit from the lack of intellect? 
---
I just have a hard time believing it is actually "better" overall.
---
Sold one 2 days ago for 40g on Faerlina Horde
---
Try a new sarcasm detector
---
There is always the neutral AH, may be better to sell there.
---
Picked em for like a month alone in Silithus and that was the timer with two layers active.
---
Have raided 10 resets, have 2 items. Keep it up lad.
---
Blood elves. Especially BE paladins. Paladins were pretty broken in TBC - and BE palains were EVEN BETTER.
---
Absolutely hilarious. Within seconds that was repaid in full lol couldn't stop watching it
---
Way more than that, s orry.
---
Yeah, but you don't try dig gold mine with spoon, do you? So what point in this laggy client?
---
I used the eye on some menethil campers and asked them on discord about  the result and they said they did not get a DHK
---
Draenei booty is best booty though.
---
Like laying?
---
Which dagger Rogue Main Hand enchant?
---
+5 Weapon Damage or Crusader?
---
Not really but I have a good comparation feeling as the last thing I played regarding WoW was vanilla. It is absolutely overpopulated.
---
no
---
It is not at all, an assumption. We know how much honor you get from BGs already, the math had been settled for 15 years. It's waaaaay better. The only role WPVP has for anyone pushing for high ranks, is grabbing a few extra HK between BGs if you have queue times. So that means high level zones immediately adjacent to horde capitals are the risky spots, as rankers will venture out looking to pad their numbers whilst queueing.
---
Eh... I've played this game a while now and I've seen people capture a market for an item and set a price... but it's always higher prices aka having a monopoly on an item and manipulating it that way.  
---
  
---
The only manipulation someone does by dropping the price of an item by 50% and flooding the market is cut into their own profit which makes no sense.  
---
Had this individual undercut by say 1c, they would still be the first choice for a buyout but would make an extra 100g.  
---
The items I bought do sell at the original price so I'm making 100% profit, it's just people keep posting them at the 50% value from where the guy I bought my stock from undercut by way too much.  
---
The issue is that now some addons are showing the 50% price as the "market price" and while I buy those too and flip them for 100% profit, it's difficult and expensive to keep buying them out (see the monopoly explanation above).  The only real downside is the time to wait for what I've bought to sell, which is fine for some items, but I don't usually play in the market for the particular item in question.
---
Shamans are the best caster late phase in Pvp. Being able to heal and one shot others is broken.
---
T1 isnt good for pvp. 
---
There is a pvp set for honor ranks. Its really good cause alot stamina. Who survives, wins. 
---
Better healing isnt bad in pvp, cause you can heal more mana efficent and can stay alive longer. 
---
Priest isnt really good at solo pvp. Priest are victims for most classes. There are alot counter,warriors break fear, hunter/locks drain your mana, Rogues kill you in stun, mages sheep and eat till you oom... 
---
But they really shine in group pvp. If have you get a little bit peel to survive your enemys burst, you can top your HP with a single cast and your teammates too. The shield is really good for every caster or healer. 
---
Specially on Horde side, only priest can despell magic - whats big deal in pvp cause most CC is magic - fear, sheep, hoj, ice trap, roots, frostnova. You dont want sit in a 30sec sheep, bring a Priest.
---
Same, but with BWL.
---
I logged in tonight to do a LBRS run, not one Alliance on the path, but that isn't usually the case. I figured you guys had it as rough if not even more so if the population starts shifting. I chose Benediction because it WAS mostly even. Hell, when I moved servers, I purposely picked it because it was a close split.
---
Too many noobs in here... tauren &gt; orc any day for horde. This isnt even close... Why? Because the classes that stun warriors u are already good against.
---
Warstomp + attackrange is op.
---
You tripping
---
No.
---
Improved life tap means you will get more mana then health sacrificed.
---
So if you have a 20% bonus your giving 100 health for 120 mana.
---
Love the fighting spirit :) Yea I just wish blizz gave real numbers, 10 people will tell you 10 different numbers
---
Damn dude chill out. It was a question.
---
Think this would be a bad level range. No proper caster gear at this point in terms of crit and damage.
---
Fate*
---
Agreed. Fights are short as it is. If I pull aggro on a mob, I have damn near 6k hp buffed so I can take a few hits while tanks get aggro back.  Average boss fight in MC is under a minute, and at 2.5 seconds a shadow bolt cast, i'm lucky to get 25 shadowbolts out in a fight. And ~20% of those are getting fully or partially resisted regardless of your gearing, as a warlock, there's just so much variance due to RNG. I just prefer the well-rounded approach instead of the glass cannon style of play. Losing buffs and consumes or dying early in a fight is brutal. Also, I really like the innate fire resist that comes on Felheart gear. Resisting more frequently, a lot of fire mechanics in the game, can really save your ass.
---
I was the third warrior to 60 on my server and I did dungeons from 10-60. But I had a group of 5 that were rdy to nolife for 2 weeks.
---
Karma
---
If I'm not mistaken it was a zeroth auto pilot
---
its it's the same only way to deal with idiots.
---
As it should be.
---
But isn’t for most.
---
Dungeons are the fastest if you have a group of dedicated players with you. Solo questing is best.
---
Recommend giving that uber one star. Glad you got home safe though
---
I'm pretty sure speed runners do 2h fury, but mostly due to hamstring kiting and the lack of hit gear at low levels making the offhand not ideal.
---
I've leveled my mage primarily by grinding mobs. Since I am a mage, some of these farms might not work for you as well as they did for me. I aimed primarily towards melee mobs. I should mention that I play during the nighttime and almost never during daytime, so some of these farms, especially the Furbolgs, could be completely overrun and inefficient. I made sure to target mobs that are mainly focused on the highest net xp gains but with decent loot tables so that I could get enough for my epic mount and some by the time I hit 60. 
---
At the 18-low 20s range I farmed the knolls in Redridge towards the border of Elwynn, progressing into the murlocs on the road to the right before the Alliance FP. 
---
When the Murlocs and Gnolls xps gains depreciated too much, I took to Duskwood where I farmed the wolves and spiders along the coast bordering Elwynn, eventually landing in the graveyard by the Westfall border where I farmed Ghouls. 
---
Once I got to around 28 or so, I went to the Wetlands, farming the orcs that are on the pathway from Loch Modan into Wetlands until the level range was green. The next step was the Murlocs bordering the coastline on the far left of the map. 
---
By the time I was in my early 30s I took to STV. I recommend buying the pages for the diary quests as it's free XP and picking up the quests that require killing wildlife. Use those quests as you go to guide you through farming mobs as they're perfect indicators for reliable farms. In STV every mob in your level range is free game including trolls, goblins, and naga. Do this until close to 40-42. 
---
Then head to Tanaris. The bandits outside of Tanaris will last you several levels, as well as the pirates off of the cove (cant remember the cove name)
---
By about 45 I went to Tanaris and farmed ogres for a while, taking me to 49. 
---
At 49 I went to Blasted Lands and camped in the caves where all of the dark iron dwarves are. You can deviate a bit and focus on the rock and fire elementals to get yourself some easy gold through elemental fires and the off chance off essence of fire. 
---
At 51 I hit Ungoro and farmed the apes for what felt like years. I left there at 53.
---
At 53 I hit up Felwood. The first Deadwood Furbolg encampment got me to 55
---
At 55 I bounced between Plaguelands and Winterspring. Between the two you have the Yetis and Furbolgs in winterspring, and in Western Plaguelands I hung out in Andorjal or w/e it is and killed undead. The undead outside of stratholm in Eastern Plaguelands is another farm that I've found very reliable. These farms will take you to 60.
---
Hmm name checks out
---
It is probably already (((fixed))) due to all the attention it got. Oh well, I had a blast dishing out DK with the yeti last night. The rank 6 mage and the 5 man party were the most fun.
---
at least horde have guards next to the blimp , you basically need to die to get on the blimp 
---
they also have a pretty nasty knockback
---
not to mention several of the blimps are horde safezones on the west side 
---
i was going to camp a blimp but its a lot less viable and they are sort of tiny , if both side of the load zone was pvp it would be worth it
---
Wow didn’t know it was 8%thats pretty big. 
---
Idk why but I would have guessed that people would put stats on a awesome piece like that but now I know =) ty
---
ok scrub
---
I mean that was a pretty rude way to answer a question. Let’s not pretend like you can’t already look up other players honor, talents and names in game. All I was asking is if there was a way to look up old players. That wouldn’t ruin anything. We all know what’s “ruining classic” if you read this sub.
---
at least find a random youtuber with good information for the guy
---
The types of conversations you're talking about happen daily in the Daily Questions thread.

LOL no it hasn’t.

Before you comment on the video you should watch it completely.

The only reason the streamer mafia (twitch partners, Asmongold, Esfand etc.) wanted Advertise being banned, is because they lost viewers (=money) to him.
---
A person like Asmongold (who reacts to content all the time, he did not create, is getting carried etc) calling someone a leech is just ridiculous.
---
Define stronger? Horde are faster than ally due to them doing more damage than ally. But ally have it easy with pallys.
---
For speed leading horde, for ease of access ally
---
All pve servers are ally dominated. Hearttseeker is the only pvp server with an ally advantage.
---
was a gm on blizz forums confirming it is still against the rules . go look for yourself
---
Blizzard doesn’t police their game anymore.
---
Farming your bis will be the best.
---
/u/uwuwize
---
You mean the alliance that dont log in anymore?
---
Correct. My plan was to steam roll every low level I could. 
---
That’s why I said I was getting my frustration out.
---
Manuel crowd punmeler is the best tanking weapon if you need to produce threat.
---
blizz has a post about this on their forums and stated they will start banning
---
I had a hunter on his mount attack me even feign death with his mount.. looked strange af but well its a 15 year old game! /s
---
I add skull of impending doom with my bubble corpse runs

this is my guild haha. it was 4 full MC groups. one guild
---
Downranked renews are underrated, but hard to use properly since other healers will steal the healing with terribly inefficient heals.
---
Grats!
---
These mobs in particular are from an exp/hour perspective, although some of them have quite good gold/hour yields also. I personally grinded my hunter from 29-60 (maybe 10% of that in questing) so I had the opportunity to test quite a few spots and track the exp/hour. Unfortunately I’m very busy so it wasn’t too often I get to play so I didn’t document exact numbers or keep up with recording etc. If you want to push exp/hour grinding mobs while also making good gold/hour these are great spots. Questing with grinding integrated will always be more efficient from a experience only perspective but I guess grinding is a bit of an acquired taste haha.
---
I’m a mage and I think it’s awesome.

I don’t think you know what “client side” and “data mining” mean.
---
plus healing IS regen
---
I don’t even care if it is - just watching The Herd QQ over having the slightest consequence of have to make the slightest effort by playing around it without a shred of awareness of the irony is delicious.
---
Horde bad
---
&gt; Let’s not pretend like you can’t already look up other players honor, talents and names in game.
---
You can't and that's the nice part.
---
&gt;That wouldn’t ruin anything. We all know what’s “ruining classic” if you read this sub.
---
Nothing? Complaining about things doesn't mean the game is being ruined. It means classic isn't for everyone and they are having a hard time understanding it. Nothing is more true that you think you want it but you don't. A bunch of people thought they wanted classic then realized they didn't like world PvP.
---
Because Blizzard are lazy and would rather shoehorn classic into the modern client, then actually spend money to make a new client/modernise the old client.
---
It'd also be an admission that the new client is pretty shite.

Realistically how active do you guys see this game being in like 6 months? Wondering if its worth rolling a new character right now, and if the late game dungeons are still gonna be active enough for the pre bis grind down the road
---
We got 3 eyes in 5 weeks.  2 back to back.
---
It’s more of a liability thing I think. Old client was likely more susceptible to hacks and such.
---
 When I played pservers, it was on a burner email with a password that looked like a keyboard seizure and no personal information at all. If it were hacked and had I used my personal email and lost information/money, no lawyers would even look at it.  If Activision/Blizzard lost my information/money, I’d have lawyers begging for the case
---
Whelps are a good one, then move onto darkshire and you can farm the wolves/spiders along the coast and then move on to the skeletons near the town then the skeletons/ogres near the graveyard area. Should get you to 30 then you can go grind the turtles or wildlife in southshore, then the raptors in arathi, then the ogres in the highlands or stv if you are on a pve server, then tanaris has some good wildlife and again ogres to grind, then late 40s probably feralas north has a good yeti cave for grinding/skinning, then you'll probably be at WPL then EPL level and finally winterspring yeti cave level.
---
If you had world buffs, maybe.
---
&lt;insert special drooling SpongeBob meme here&gt;
---
Probably a dumb question here but what is the benefit of faction ratios on a pve server other than to know if an entire server is empty?

Probably the same reason my ex voted to increase taxes for xyz reason and then bitched and complained that she now has to pay a couple hundred dollars more per year in taxes.
---
Thanks for the reply. 
---
&gt;They're there for honour, too.
---
But many of them aren't. They are just attempting to quest, get to dungeons, and level. 
---
 &gt;The real problem for the horde is that while we are one group roaming around, there are like 5-10 other groups doing the same thing, so even though our group isn't camping people, the collective of players in the region IS camping people.
---
This is what I was seeing. And if even one of those ten other groups does the corpse camping thing it just adds to "all horde camp us" stuff.
---
For myself, I am about to check out. I tried leveling an alt until BG's pop, but kept on having death squads camping out Darkshire...not really sure what the solution is here.
---
This is the crux of the issue. I rolled PvP to fight the opposite faction over resources in places like Silithus, or have impromptu skirmishes to spice up the 60 life. 
---
I DIDNT roll PvP to get camped *inside* the walls of places like Gadgetzan. Or be forced to do all my leveling grinding dungeons because I’m outnumbered 5+ people to just me in the open world.
---
^
---
And for real douches I make I note
---
You mean 40v5.
---
We all know what’s up. Go do 5v5 and stop camping brm and FP’s.
---
What was is deleted for?
---
Mate.... its a comparison of my overall dps from 2 UBRS runs. One using Dreadforge, one using Dal'rends. Same buffs. Same everything else. Obviously the numbers arent exact...
---
You come off as very condescending.
---
Nice troll. The use effect has a level requirement. The only beneficial thing with the pouch for a lvl 19 is the stats.
---
Do not use that build.   Yikes.  Go imp sprint daggers.
---
have you witnessed?
---
This is the perfect response.
---
Flawless fucking execution.
---
nah, there is dynamite too. Also sapper charges.
---
Must be nice being able to run raids and dungeons. As an alliance, we are prevented from entering those places.
---
Nurple.
---
Ya.
---
Dreadforge is better, the +5 weapon skill is huge in raiding
---
Also if you want to raid with dual wielding then you absolutely should be specced in imp. DW
---
Jokes on me for assuming your second comment would have something to do with your first.
---
A lvl 19 cannot use it in in todays classic.
---
Fucking amazing
---
Lol says the guy who probably plays horde on an 80/20 server. How’s Skeram working out for you?
---
With Naxx gear, mages will be one shotting people too. They also have much better mobility and survivability on top of it. Naxx just gives insane damage.
---
Shamans are better than Paladins at offense, but the Alliance don't have to replace a Shaman with a Paladin. They can replace them with a Mage who is just as good. Meanwhile, Horde have no good replacement for Paladins.
---
In my experience I can go through 30+ shards in a raid easy. Same with pvp. I don't want to be worrying about needing shards when I need them, with this habit I know I'll have enough for whatever. A warlock with no shards is a shitty shitty spot to be in. You're not using them enough if you think you only need a few.
---
No they won’t.
---
Thanks, thats definitely the impression I got.
---
After all the rogues had one maybe? Ya definitely after all the rogues have them.

---
i guess if you are on a lowish pop server or something. horde arent dumb. on my server they are camping thorium point + morgans vigil along with raids constantly camping both entrances.
---
Well I guess in 2 years we can see who is right.
---
In the mean time, Alliance will dominate.
---
It doesn't take a lot of effort to grab mongoose/roids/firewater/juju power/sharpening stones, but does make a big difference to your dps and your rage generation.
---
As someone who was playing Korraks for the mounts as horde. Out of all the games I played until I maxed out the challenge, I we only lost 1 game. Now thats a fairly small sample size, but it was what happened.
---
Someone commented earlier that it snapshots your +healing when you equip it. You can then put on your normal gear. Their source was their guildmate
---
Epic gamer meme
---
I’m an ally mage and couldn’t care less. I don’t camp fp’s or Zerg camp.
---
I can counter them casting it, poly reset the fight, etc or even just take off and stalk them and re-engage.
---
I’m used to having to push more than two buttons so it’s not a big deal, at fucking all.
---
Everyone who thinks it is, oh man are the telling on themselves.
---
Love it.
---
Destiny sword would like a word with you.
---
You’re an orc... yes your dps will be crazy different going with an axe to swords unless you have edgemasters.
---
I am not surprised... with dreadforge your hit cap is 6% (assuming capped skill and against mobs 3 levels higher), your glancing blow also does significantly more damage.
---
Try and get some 1h axes and compare those. Also what talent build are you using?
---
I mean, you're playing a semantics game because you have no leg to stand on to. If you actually thought 3 seconds before posting your spergtantrum you would've seen that what he says is 100% correct in the context of the first comment. Except you instantly replied like a pathetic human being getting frustrated over nothing.
---
Really cringy comments, get some therapy bud.
---
Exactly how would it be griefing? Assuming it works, it will not change your gameplay at all. It is not like having 50 level one characters ghosted at Kazzak to prevent a raid from killing him. You can still play around the DK and the eye.
---
I can’t believe there are actually people who are so thick skulled that they can’t empathize with this position.
---
Slow Clap.  You evil bastard.   My man.
---
Go play on any naxx progressed pserver. You will agree with me. So I’m right now. 
---
But ya. Ally will have the advantage. But skill&gt;meta comp. meta only applies if everyone is playing perfectly which never happens.
---
Of course it was. That's why I specified modernising it.   
---
The issue with the old clients is security, not performance or getting it to work on modern systems. 
---
They had the choice of fucking the game up entirely, and make it cheaply on the modern client, or they could spend quite a bit of money to ensure a great experience by taking an older client and bringing it up to modern expectations.
---
Refused for 5 mans? Your server is whack. 
---
Or if you mean raids then that's up to your guild, like i said some will ask you to respec more for future content, no spec right now is holding a guild back from clearing MC when it's doable by casual guilds with only 30 players and non level 60s in the group but yeah if the guild plans on progressing in future phases it may be a waste to gear up a "meme" spec when the harder content hits.
---
nah i hate it but i want the honor to get gear and get to rank 11 for the mount and im not gonna stop doing it but i also dont enjoy it
---
All names show regardless of nameplates by default anyway, it wouldn't hide him if someone walked into the room.
---
There is no way until paid transfers (maybe).
---
If you want to move, you'll need to reroll.
---
Not all your rogues will want or be able to play daggers depending on the distribution of your weapon drops. All the dagger rogues get it first, then it goes to warriors, who can use it effectively in the off hand for rage generation.
---
Non-orc and non-human warriors, sure. There is a ton of dagger weapon skill you can get from equipment.
---
This is what I said, “It works lol. I just used mine. As in equipping it and gaining the stats effect.”
---
The pouch doesn’t have a level requirement. And using it to me is putting it on.
---
Totems
---
By “gear” you mean bench them until they respec?
---
I do have empathy. That doesn't mean I think it's okay for people to willfully cheat and violate terms of service to beat some people that technically aren't cheating or violating TOS. Come up with a better solution. I can't wait to hear the bitching gallery when the majority faction is fp camping *and* cheating to force dks on the minority faction. Your fucking heads will really explode then.
---
Should still be active, when it comes to dungeons people will still be running alts through.
---
Realistically though you do not need BiS before raiding anyway, so in 6 months time if you ding 60 you should be able to just get a bunch of MC gear quite easily while guilds are farming it for legendaries/alt runs/pug runs are going on.
---
If classic plays out like vanilla, the early tier raids like ony and MC were being run all the way through it's life span.
---
Yep you didn't understand OP concern regarding the pouch. Now you do.
---
I'm an officer in my guild trying to implement monolith dkp but for some reason when I /dkp I still don't see any of the editable functions from the videos/screen shots. I can only see Player/Class/Total DKP. I can view/edit guild and officer notes and have reinstalled the addon several times. Am I missing something?
---
No one is forcing anyone to kill the eye.
---
Damn that's sad. anyway have fun
---
How did he know what it was called if he didnt know he could do it :/
---
Not only did he play in Vanilla, but he was a crazy good warrior. I really hope this was a skit because if it's not, something isnt working properly in that brain of his.
---
Yeah jokes on you for trying to delve that deep into my shitcomments
---
Narc
---
Says the guy whose guild runs around in giant zergs and does exactly what is shown in the picture.  BGs will certainly even the playing field, you won't be able to win by only outnumbering people, and just running away when the numbers are somewhat even won't be a viable option.
---
Your Slice and Dice should be up all the time anyway
---
Bank on winning only head roll
---
I feel the same, just feels so wrong.
---
?
---
No I'm having a dig at the mods, the OP is great. Been banned for anti China shit by this commie website several times, but it seems mods are asleep.
---
10/10
---
You need Greater Arcane Elixirs. Bring around 5.
---
You mean somebody would just go on the internet and lie for fake internet points!?
---
yeah because ally go in one at a time and res one at a time no coordination at all after they summon up
---
Yeah I have engi, but like I said, you rarely ever use anything as a warlock. Everything you mentioned is useful in certain scenarios, 80% of the time fights are predetermined by the numbers...especially with the faction imbalance. If you're with a group you'll likely have other people to use rocket helm/nets. Warlocks have fear and group utility curses which are much more useful and should be used instantly. BG's are another story. Of course engi is great, but most of the time it really only applies to 1v1s or 1v2s, if you're group wpvping you already have tons of value without engi...and it would hardly hurt going mining/herb to grab more gold. Of course if you want to min/max go engi
---
Lol wtf dude said pvp
---
Take the current population, and divide by like 5-10
---
corehound tooth?  gutgore ripper?  whatever, it doesn't matter.  it's an offhand weapon, it's not exactly a big deal.
---
Bruh, on my server it’s about equal pop and alliance are far more aggressive. Such a bizarre server. Horde seem like PVE bots for the most part. They’ll ride right past if you’re getting jumped 1v3.
---
“This guy seems upset about his marriage.”
---
*checks username*
---
lvl 55 "guards" are a joke
---
I agree it's not obvious why there's imbalance, too many possible factors. I'll say this, though. There's something about "For The Horde!" that's extra badass. I'm Alliance and I feel like I've always been expected to be embarrassed about that when I met new people that played.
---
I got down voted really badly and acused of trolling last time I posted my rotation to redit.
---
Not sure it is even worth posting again but here is best way I have found to max out dps. I was third highest against ragnaros this week in my guild using this approach, the two people higher than me were mages.
---
To start I spam sinister strike until out of energy. Then I use thistle tea and continue to spam sinister strike until 5 combo points. At 5 I press slice and dice. Then continue to spam sinister strike. Once tea wears off and you start hearing out of energy voice line I then press adrenaline rush and spam sinister until 5 combo points. Then eviscerate at 5 and continue to spam sinister. 
---
At this point snd buff is probably low so I refresh it then continue casting 5 point eviscerate.
---
Basically try to maximise how many 5 point eviscerate you can get off without the snd buff dropping off. 
---
Use cool downs as early as you can. I.e use adrenalin rush and thistle tea early in phase 1 of onyxia and quite often it will be back up for phase 3 of the fight. At least my guild always takes forever in phase 2.
---
I rolled a warlock. Was a really easy decision. Vs Undead as 1/3 of the enemy or no undead.
---
Not sure how accurate this site is, but have a look at pop [here](https://ironforge.pro/servers)  
---
also, from what i gather bgs are going to be cross server, so, it really doesnt matter about pop being 50/50 on pve, just pick biggest alliance server and go with that, more guilds &gt; more fun
---
If you do low price, bots will snipe it
---
Chinglish, recently renamed to Pandatv for sponsors.
---
Understandable. If you can come up with a fair solution I’m sure blizzard wants to hear it!
---
So far it's the only build being posted. Feel free to contribute something that is 1.) a dagger build and 2.) excels at more than ganking L50 toons in a raid.
---
Rogue avoidance tank. 
---
Rogues only need 15agi per 1% dodge so something like 0/26/25 as a human or 0/28/23 would allow them to use both BF and Evasion at least twice each fight. With the Setup talent + Ghostly Strikes they’d have so many cp’s to consume.
---
Guess you’d need Salvation on everyone and priests to spam PW:S but I think it would be possible.
---
Also spellpower ret.
---
Your 'or' statement doesn't make sense, you can spam sinister strikes AND then spend for a 5 point snd if the timing is right so you don't overwrite too much time leftover from your last snd.  Ideally though, you want to use it when you pop other cooldowns.
---
You will be spamming sinister strikes into evis/snd.  SS and evis are both boosted by increased AP, so you should wait for a crusader or 2 to proc.  I'm an orc so I pop blood fury for increased AP.  Then since I have all this increased AP I also pop blade flurry.  To get more hits in while I have extra AP.  Blade flurry has the added bonus of giving you more leeway to sinister strike after each hit.  If you're unaware, SS can proc sword spec/hoj procs which resets your swing timer.  So you want that lower swing timer to more easily spam SS while avoiding having your energy ticks capping out at 100 while you wait.  Now although you can use this to get an easy 5 point snd, I prefer to get that off before popping all this because I'd rather get a 5 point evis off with the bonus AP during this combo.
---
&gt;ONE press of a button, like 200 mana and all 10 people in the raid instantly get buffed
---
Just imagine how much threat the tank would get for spamming GBoK on that raid.
---
Windseeker is roughly 50/50
---
I think that was me... *shame*
---
Pretty sad you're probably a pathetic horde player butt hurt its some that can't be killed.
---
Why would you get downvoted? This sounds very sensible and is basically what I do also - though we aim to kill Rag before the submerge.
---
Using 5 point slice and dice is useless on Rag because you spend a lot of your time in the in and outs waiting, so if slice and dice is up and you aren’t auto attacking that shows wasted energy, obviously happens a bit but you might only get like half the use of a 5 point snd
---
Windseeker is really the only option if you want wpvp at all (you get to opt in/out of course) as it is the only pve server with a near 50/50 ratio.
---
&gt; Well it's not the right Phase to go SoF for starters.
---
With 5/8 T1 and a Perdition's Blade you should be good to go.
---
&gt; I do more burst going Cold Blood - Prep than that rogue in the video.
---
How do you build your combo points? Do you use daggers for that?
---
They potentially royally fuck it up and ruin classic for alot of people, that would be the worst case.
---
I thought the same thing until I tried it and realized how wrong I was.
---
Alliance: Do you?
---
We agree, we're just talking past each other because I have a more fluid idea of calling a rogue a dagger or sword rogue. 
---
When a rogue is given PB or CHT, he becomes a dagger rogue. But could it not have been said that he becomes a dagger rogue when it drops and the decision is made to award it to him? Then why is it wrong to say to give it to the dagger rogues before the warriors?
---
I guess you see that as a more complicated definition, but it allows for personal preference among the rogues to determine prio orders for them. A rogue talks to his loot council and the other rogues and says he would rather be a sword rogue, so he gets prio for swords and deprioed for daggers. He would still get it over a warrior if swords never drop, but this is a real scenario that has real application.
---
Good to know. I have never played on a pve server before. I had just assumed that wpvp was not much of a thing as people chose a pve realm. If there was an issue with pvp being one sided is it not then just good to disable the pvp toggle? Im sure looking from the outside and playing on a pve server are two entirely different things.
---
Wasting money on Ret paladins. SMH. -Koriky
---
Hit cap really is the worst part atm.  I won a Felheart Belt and honestly I haven't equipped it over Banthok Sash yet.  I just want that 1% hit too much.  I'll be putting it on for battlegrounds though, 100%.
---
Lots of uses for it in solo play especially if your solo farming Mara or diremaul or when your fighting any elite demon in general thanks to doom + banish.
---
...I love your purple headed staff because it's epic
---
Too many stubborn Mages, Priests, and Warlocks who think they can get the best bag recipe and cash in on it.
---
4 days to make 5g is a joke.
---
It's a flight path?
---
As a horde, I'm actually hoping they fix the pvp wall jumps.  It's completely unsatisfying to hop up there and skip the whole fight into the base.  Same goes for the alliance fence jump, AB roof jumps, and wsg nonsense.
---
Even if they came up with classic + there would be ppl spamming articles and addons to questie showing the right choices and optimization within a week or two of release. I don’t think we will ever be able to go back and capture the time where information was not readily available. 
---
It’s like trying to explain to kids now days why local myths spread so rampantly and whole communities believed certain things. My dad grew up in the city and as a kid thought there were sharks/shark like creatures in lakes and refused to swim bc the information you got was mostly from secondhand unreliable information. Now a days you just google that crap and call out your friend for misinformation. 
---
TLDR: we will never recapture the age of exploration in video games. The internet has optimized everything to the point where we will know what is best instantly.
---
Your issue with your aggro has to do with the fact that your offhand has an extremely high chance to miss.
---
Mooncloth is currently useless, the only things of use craftable out of it are bags, and these aren't particularly in short supply. (16 slot and 18 slot).
---
In phase 4, bloodvine set will be the best raid DPS option for a while for caster DPS, sans a few exceptions.
---
(Mage with 8 Netherwind gets more damage from keeping the bonus(8) than equipping the bloodvine set)
---
Kek
---
First thing first, respec to either mortal strike or bloodthirst...
---
Doom cannot crit. If you have the imp shadowbolt debuff when it procs it will do the increased damage that is what you are seeing not a crit.
---
Its harder to incriminate someone that is buying stuff off of the auction house. By having gold sellers outright mail you the gold, you're putting a target on your head. 
---
But I doubt that matters. The GM moderation during classic has been nothing short of a complete joke.
---
That's because it can't, but it does get amplified damage if it goes off while imp shadow bolt debuff is up.
---
You didnt even take imp stealth... Have you ever pvp'd ?
---
Who's Asmongold, I'm enjoying my time in a random server I chose.
---
Yeah. Capture quality is great

Regarding your edit, the cancer isn’t in the BiS lists, it’s in the guild and their tryhards.  The BiS is just a symptom.  Mediocre guilds use it as gatekeeper to make their guild appear more grandiose.  It’s no different than those job requirements asking for a computer science degree and 10 years of experience for a desktop support IT job.  
---
Good guilds measure a player by 90% skill, 10% gears.  Shitty guilds just want min/max best in slotters because it allows them to put the blame for failure on the gear, when everyone knows it’s the players.  If you’re a shitty raid leader/MT you can just pass the buck on your raid and absolve yourself of any fuck ups.  
---
Because at the end of day no one wants to be the weakest link, and it’s easier to just point fingers at the guys in quest greens and off spec pre BIS rather than examine your tactics, fight knowledge, and leadership skill sets.
---
Thanks, now I shall scout out the yes green area.

What the fuck I can't believe the Horde would do this. Bunch of griefers have nothing better to do than form multiple 40 man raids to kill a handful of Alliance.
---
I bet all Horde players live in their basements and spend all day doing nothing but killing low level players because they think it makes them good at PvP.
---
Horde players all have small dicks and need to make up for it by killing people who they outnumber 10 to 1 all they do is camp flightpaths and instance portals.
---
Blizz needs to do something about the Horde problem, I say ban half of them and the game will be fixed.
---
Outside of duels with other rogues? Sure have.
---
Hol up. Round Robin was complicated so this is the response? This is too much.
---
&gt;its so broken
---
Rivendare's sword is not that great damage-wise. It's super-rare. Mortal strike cuts your regen in half. It doesn't increase your health pool, so you can still be deleted by PoM-Pyro or something like that.
---
Troll village is actually part of the alliance mage aoe farm route on some guides
---
So I can simply assume everything you post isn't worth reading. Good to know.
---
If you fly it into aoe yes you are.
---
&gt;Idk what the Paladin dire maul trinket does but it could add healing
---
It does.
---
**Obviously** a rogue can pass it to other rogues. We're talking about rogues to warriors.
---
If a rogue wants to be swords and other rogues who still need perdition's blade, it's **obviously** going to the rogues that want to be daggers.
---
The entire point is if the option is between giving it to a rogue that doesn't have a raid weapon or a warrior, **the rogue gets it 100% of the time, regardless of his desired spec**, because it's a massive fucking upgrade for a rogue and mediocre for warriors.
---
I just wait for other people to finish the quest while stealthed or hiding near the toee, and turn in the quest when its clear.
---
Just fyi you didn't crit, you had doom go off with imp shadow bolt debuff up. No dot can crit.
---
Like... why? What for? I have 2 60's, both with epic mounts and I have gold to spare.
---
You'll get banned sooner or later over something that really isn't much effort to make.
---
My guild mass reports at least one Horde player for the N word in BRM every Tuesday night, never fails.
---
 I didnt say anyhting about camping someone after they spirit res? What are you on about
---
You basically are playing retail ez mode, lol.
---

Literally the rarest of all the boss drops by far.
---
It isn't really relevant to my comment.
---
Your assertion was "this issue didn't exist until p2", not "this issue didn't exist ON MY SERVER until p2". If the issue existed on my server, it existed.
---
You do you, but I absolutely disagree.
---
Imagine reporting the same group of people for botting since week two of game launch and there are still out and about botting.
---
Actually, you don't need to imagine it, because that is what is happening.
---
Can always level to the next bracket it is doesn't excite them.
---
Its not impressive by community standards i mean people probably had that week 1 or 2 of release but personal accomplishments are a thing so be proud for yourself!
---
Well, plenty of tanks use a sword and board to tank. That loadout would be even *less* aggro. I think it my issue had more to do with being underleveled/undergeared for the content.
---
Well, I think you got downvoted because you're wrong. This is not the best approach. The question for *"max DPS"* is a mathematical one and your answer is simply incorrect.
---
You can confirm this using ClassicSim (which isn't perfect, not every fight happens under laboratory conditions) or Warcraft Logs (compare your raid to others, take a closer look at what the top performers are doing).
---
Shoulda rolled PvE ;)
---
He had an stroke? He looks very grey in his face.
---
Most likely just beaststalker 4 set bonus+devilsaur set+ 5% hit and stam/agi gear.
---
Fair enough. I'm inclined to agree.
---
The Pandaren are a very forgiving bunch. Monks especially would be wise enough to know there's a difference between one Zul's invading soldiers, and a young Initiate who is willing to learn.

Yeah, just run Strat UD 10 times per day every day for a year or so.

You dont have time to mine and herb while grinding ranks haha
---
Nooby question: Why does my crit chance go from 20% to 12% when I equip a different weapon? I'm dual wielding a Sword in main-hand slot (but not a Main-Hand wep)+Dagger, bought a Main-Hand mace and swapped my sword to the off-hand slot, and now I have 12% crit..?? My dagger only has 8 Agi which is like 0.5% crit chance. 
---
I'm sure there's a simple answer to this..thanks in advance.
---
&gt;While this is true, the game relies on a social interaction and social hierarchy
---
Most MMOs are. This is entirely self perceived though. So to what degree you let it affect how you play and feel about the game is up to yourself. Besides one does not have to excel relatively to your peers to enjoy the adventure of vanilla wow, that's more of a modern min/max view on it if you ask me. One of the cool things about the game is that you are not presented as the savior of azeroth, but one of many, that might spend his time just helping a simple farmer gather some crops.
---
What server
---
Update: I managed to escort him to the tower. Where he died. And didn't get revived. Quest failed. A fitting end to my time with this game :)
---
Curb Your Enthusiasm*
---
I remember it being the opposite way. The horde cave was further back and the alliance had A slight advantage in getting to the horde towers, so at some point they moved it a little closer to be even with the alliance. Also the alliance have the bridge, which is a much better chokepoint than the horde side. AV has always had an alliance slant, except the small window when horde started playing defense only and winning on reinforcements in BC or cata or something.
---
Funny how that's an epic you actually want to keep at level 60 and people don't see it as anything useful. People are all kinds of stupid.
---
To be honest, I have very little experience with pvp on pve servers.
---
Any pserver time I had was on pvp servers (as they tend to be what is on offer in the pserver community),  and though I played classic at launch, I then left town about 3 weeks later (well before phase 2) for a good couple months and didn't immediately start playing again when I got back. 
---
I had HOPED that those towers in the plaguelands would see some use on pve servers, but that is just pure hopes and dreams on my end, not backed up by any actual experience (I was told pre launch that they got basically ignored back when they happened in retail). 
---
Really, I don't know what is on offer on pve servers, but I myself am strongly considering rerolling to the most balanced server I can find for pve. Though unfortunately, it looks like blizzard broke all the census addons to make it even harder to find a properly balanced pve server.
---
damn you think it'll reduce that much?
---
*shrug* All I have to say is "Blizzard".
---
&gt; After 4 deaths you are worth 0 to them.

To *that* group. He's still worth full honor to the next group, and the next...

---
I might be reading too much into his comment, but on my realm Morgan's Vigil is camped so much that the flight master is almost continuously dead.
---
That's what I thought he meant by no flight path.
---
I can't tell you what's right or wrong but I can tell you that I'd never go with the 6% increased Agony if you think about how little of an improvement it really is.
---
There is a potentially infinite supply of winter squid. It's just there arent enough people fishing them up - you can fish for half an hour to get a stack of squid, or you can do something else ... and people are choosing to do something else.

In what world? It's very mediocre. Yeah, it's a nice tank weapon, but not edgemasters-on-orc nice.

The fuck am I reading lmao

Goblin Rocket Fuel can't melt steel beams.
---
A white kodo cuz after 15 years that’s all blizzard could come up with.
---
a good warlock hard counters pallies all day though. paladins are great but i'd pref windfury with some good warriors + a good warlock to negate pally
---
who? pom pyro mage in pve gear?
---
Not even 60 and having that is way more impressive than Rag in 5days!
---
You realise those titles are for rank 1 right? How could they possible get multiple people the mounts?
---
Catharsis.
---
&gt;. If any serious Horde player wanted really excellent PvP ranking, they would have gone Alliance.
---
funny you say that, we have multiple warrior rankers and they all prefer horde for wf
---
You're probably joking, but that is how dark souls pvp is done, it's called having honor.
---
I played aggamagan alliance. Was in a top alliance guild. I can't remember my guild name to save my life... Was a fun server though.
---
Getting that at 58 is very cool. Loved crafting that and hunting down all the mats.
---
My favorite is when basilisks flop over upside down when they die.
---
He doesn't get revived - his father comes and wipes the floor with his killers.
---
a good warlock, SL really, pretty much hard counters a pally, and you're tanky enough with pvp gear to survive anyone they try to send to peel. basically as long as you blow their bubble early you did your job.
---
Grind whatever is around your level and you can go from one mob to another fast. maximize your XP per hour.
---
Also skeleton mages, and worgen shadow weavers in Duskwood would be something to farm in the future.
---
You can certainly be killed, but it is crazy, and you can still play a holy paladin or any kind of hunter with relatively less sacrifice. The rarity makes it not a very realistic goal, but it still seems really strong.
---
using it on My Priest, my Friend on his Druid and now I bought it for my Hunter.    
---
This item is a cheap rune/healthstone mix.    
---
It has saved me a Manapot in raids and my life aswell (mostly during Dungeons/PvP) quite often. Equip, use, equip your good necklace, profit.   
---
Just bought one for 25g yesterday to flip it (not for the first time), will sell it again for 40-50g soon.     
---
This item is actually one of the few useful epics for mana classes.
---
Rank 14 Warrior in Vanilla... weird to see this
---
There was a human rogue on aggamagan with it also if I remember correctly..
---
it depends. WF is ridic in pvp and there is no "counter" to getting WF proc'd, along with every warrior having HoJ...nasty. 
---
a pally can be shut down hard by a decent warlock, SL especially, they're gonna have to blow their bubble real early, can switch focus for a sec then back to the pally.
---
You are right. I guess I just get irritated with so many people wanting to try dual wield fury tanking at low levels. You absolutely cannot expect your healers to be able to keep up with that if you are joining pugs
---
I'm not a native english speaker but phyrric is now my new favorite word, thanks!
---
As if, for one moment, anyone thought i wasn't going to roll on anything anyway.
---
I will use my vacuum cleaner to suck ur blood from ground u will get 1 hit combo kill LOL u think ur bubble will save u? U neeed to be able to press button but warlock is most OP so I will maybe let u live... hm nope all allys gonna get PvPwned
---
I hate you. I'm in the hospital because it hurts to breathe and I'm laughing my ass off while writhing in pain
---
He was a decent warrior, he wasn't crazy good. His rise to fame was when he made a video called swifty one shot macro which most warriors already have been using in some form already and also for his constant razr giveaways. 
---
Might sound like a salt factory worker but i'm just implying he is not someone so revered for his info that he can't make a mistake. (Pretty noobish mistake tho not gonna lie)
---
idk why this guy said naxx gear, ele shams can 1 shot most classes before naxx gear. also, a good SL warlock will shut down a pally incredibly hard, the only time the pally will get free time to heal anyone is in bubble, the bubble they had to pop 4 seconds into a fight lol
---
Grats mon. Now keybind the rest of your keys mon. TAZ DINGOO
---
So lets see. A typical shaman list would then be:
---
1. Weapon
---
2. Rag Shield
---
3. Ony Trinket
---
4. Cauterizing Band
---
5. T1 Helm
---
Most likely almost everyone has the same list. Making it not super useful as a loot system. Also it is super high maintenance. It can also result in some real fuckery. 
---
Lets say I expect the list to look like this already. So instead I take the rag shield out and then have loot prio over everyone else for the next 4 items?
---
I joined an Alliance pvp raid and immediately got summoned from IF to the fucking base of the zeppelin tower. The organizer said he thought there would be time to group and summon.
---
Instead of trying to rez I just watched everyone else die for half an hour as I surfed Youtube.
---
it's not even as bad as people think.   
---
Most players simply don't know about skill normalization.   
---
Slow Weapons are still better at similar dps but this one got a double crusader procc and isn't as bad as it seems.
---
I go the no route because I have come to learn the patterns and habits of the enemy so I've never had to experience the corpse camp runs on my server except once (the day of learning). Playing Ark has taught me how to survive predators o.o.......
---
Right? I've seen 20+ posts with pictures/gifs so far about horde being scummy pvp'ers on servers where they outnumber alliance, and like every time in the comments someone is posting like "horde have it the same on alliance-heavy servers!" (wow, on both of them?), but I've yet to see a single picture/gif or anything with it actually happening.
---
I was watching the Warsong Tournaments and tbh it wasnt looking good for the alliance team..
---
Isnt that the one where if you have better gear than others you are less likely to get items? I have better gear than most others, so I will just pug until the others have good gear as well cool.
---
Whenever I log back in my HKs are either where they should be or they're doubled. My rank after adjustments during the reset reflected the proper number of HKs and honor. Its evidently a UI bug.
---
WOTF is stupid good. priest warlock warrior, all used to having people locked up for a few seconds in fear, nope not today. doubly so for UD warlocks that can get feared and then counter fear that person.
---
gomes decent, dwarf is good in very specific scenarios thats about it. 
---
&gt;  having paladins makes ally win any fight than is big enough to have one. 
---
this is so completely out of touch I don't even know what to say lol. paladins aren't some unstoppable power, they have a few counters, SL lock most notably. they're the best pvp healer, that is true, but they aren't some massive trump card over the horde in the vast majority of circumstances.
---
I've watched him a few times and he's absolutely clueless about the game, which is bizarre seeing as he has played it forever, just basic things he has no idea about.
---
Nah we always had some griefers and fp/boat/zep campers, but it was never this daily 20+ groups doing it for hours.
---
Warriors can use daggers not only in the offhand. And perdition blade/corehound tooth on Warrior is a very competitive combo DPS-wise.
---
they prefer them for pve, not for pvp
---
Lol, POM Pyro to the face.
---
was expecting an rogue to ambush him outta nowhere, this is even better
---
Sappa squad my man
---
Buzz! You missed the truck!
---
We're not aiming for the truck...
---
Why are u raiding as enhance?
---
Melee Warlock. I did get to try it from 48-58. Basically soul link, improved Firestone, fiery enchant, thrash blade and nightfall
---
All the dots, pet damage and very frequent melee procs had high dps in maraudon and ST and some BRD, super mana efficient and tanky
---
A couple tweaks and a little supporting gear and I feel it would be totally viable at 60 - and a lot of fun to play
---
Improved firestone kind of implies melee Warlock was a thought
---
Upvoted for profile icon.
---
Now imagine everyone has the same list and one guy already expecting it. They will change one item to be 1 in front for all but the first item.
---
Trust me, I have lots of honour
---
Got a link to the tournament?
---
&gt; mid maxing
---
This might be a typo, but I love it. I'm going to start referring myself as a "mid-maxer" since I'm way too casual but still want to at least make an effort.
---
Thank the Light that 1 for 1 the Alliance is just so god damned superior.
---
Yeah I understand but without CGLGs it’s not worth going daggers as a warrior, and ACLGs have dropped a massive once for us (and were of course given to a rogue).
---
as someone without exams, haha
---
Cross realm
---
I am and my guild clears MC pretty easy
---
One of my coworkers has said that Horde were rolling Alliance in AV hard on retail. Caught me a bit by surprise.
---
Play orc like most idiots do after reading some guides online.
---
Sea of thieves
---
It's cheap for sure, and AV 1.12 is the biggest mistake Blizzard has done regarding classic. The first iteration of AV where it was hardcore remains the best.
---
What is the reasoning in your opinion?
---
60-80g on Arugal, server with queue times up to 2 hours on weeknights :/
---
Some say he never got off the Gryphon... if you look up sometimes you can still see him glitching through the wall.
---
This is the obvious question lol its hard to get worked up over a meme item for a meme spec.
---
Assuming I care about being banned in this unplayable game.
---
Everyone clears MC easy. Where are you Warriors and Rogues? They should be shitting on you quite easily.
---
1) Horde players are better at pvp overall. 
---
2) Horde players are also much bigger assholes in general and they have beef with Alliance, whereas Alliance are chilled out with all of the nice looking cities and women.
---
3) I'm inspired to spec 3 minute mage when BGs are released.
---
I made all our orc fury warriors (of which I am one) without edgies (all) pass on Vis’Kag and brutality blade in preference to a rogue. 
---
But with edgies I think it’s perfectly even due to the lack of axe options (zero deathbringer’s so far). Otherwise there’s kind of a benefit to being Tauren/Troll/Undead with edgies as you could roll on both whereas your orcs aren’t allowed the same.
---
Uh are you an Uber?
---
They can. Kinda sucks after spending 500g though
---
This is art
---
His real rise to fame was his pvp videos.
---
I can’t really speak for everything cause I’m bad at grinding but the charred vale specifically I got from level 26-27 and made 14g in about an hour between vendoring and auctioning the cloth / light feathers / elemental fire. I saw a ton of bots out there while doing a quest and figured they must be here for a reason.
---
Exorsus Raid Tools if you want to track your raid. 
---
Unlock the „Mark Bar“ and press the health pot symbol to open up the list. 
---
It also auto opens during ready check.
---
This.
---
Resto shamans are just enhance shamans that respecced to their raid spec for a raid.
---
Enhance shamans in a raid are just Arms warriors. You can’t use your 41 point ability and your dps is trash as a result.
---
Another cringe comment, "no u!". Wow so impressive dude. Get some social skills and understanding of wow.
---
That's what I meant yeah. Didn't happen. Pretty good!!!
---
One of the reasons i like PvP video is because there are ton of music i usually not listen to but i could like
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
It's for pvp not pve. So they let offspec people roll who would use it.
---
That seems to be common. I ran rfc twice on the same character and ended up with groups primarily consisting of warlocks and voidwalkers each time since tanks never showed up.
---
Watched him the other day raid MC and got knocked back by Rag while tanking and proceeded to practically miss the entire fight. Does not surprise me
---
Lol he better not
---
Titan panel and you can put the design you want so I put a druid design
---
Ns ele is a viable spec and provides healing as much as it does burst damge.
---
Most of shaman play on horde side is purging anyway. Thanks for showing everyone how completely fucking clueless you are.
---
To get permanent position as nightfall user
---
Have you guys heard people are getting ganked on the way to BRD?
---
To get hand of rag. I'll be the nightfall guy.
---
This is the T0, not the T1.  :)
---
This is true. Realistic market price on firemaw right now is around 1K.
---
I imagine grounding and windfury are much less impactful in group PvP right? Tremor would seriously jack up Locks and Priests. 
---
The real benefit in Shamans vs Paladins is definitely plate armor. Both can get a chunk of armor from their shields but the full plate makes it easier to survive a rogue opening or warrior opening
---
Am I the only one who knows to jump up onto the sails/masts??
---
There is a quest for levels ~50 at the apothecarium that sends you to gather water from ponds in azshara to cure a poor female tauren who was sick and seeked undead help as her last resort ... turns out they aren't developing a cure at all. Completing that quest always feels bad ...but xp is xp
---
Significantly worse, yes.  Gear for crit and AP after that, but it does still do a little for you.
---
Wait do lesser healing waves jump too?
---
I mean icemail jerkin? I'd vendor that shit
---
No, because warcraftlogs only accepts combatlogs, for obvious reasons.
---
Just log your own shit, it's not hard.
---
IT IS I, KIMBERLY, DEFENDER OF THE HORDE
---
not really, they just have to attack me and I pop insigna.
---
Still, if your 'battlegroup' has an n-amount of servers which are all horde dominated (which is a feasible assumption looking at the numbers, lol), expect queues.
---
idk hes definitely confused on something. no one sold rank 1 for 1000g, even 1000g for gladiator on a backwater server is pushing it.  i was selling it for 15-20k in s3/s4 depending on the class/gear. 2050 for weapons was around 5000.
---
Yeah would love for wsg to be fixed but I'd bet a lot of money that it won't be
---
This makes me want to roll a rogue lol
---
Their racials aren’t  close to Horde by a long shot. Nothing comes close to WotF and Orcs stun resist. Even the Druids eek out in Taurens favor.
---
Meuh meuh meuh !
---
And I was fond of the cows level in Diablo II
---
Never my intention to "outsmart" you. Wrong again, bucko
---
Or go from kargath
---
Troll toll
---
Meh, I don't care for wpvp or ranks personally. It's kinda the kind of shit I see. I just want to hit exalted. Hopefully pve servers are included in grps.   
---
They're probably just pool all the regionals
---
High end warrior does not want fast MH. And it is not because of whirlwind
---
The mech yheti on use item is not the DK part of the quest turns goblin NPCS In everlook to small Yheti and I believe that’s what gives the Dk
---
Oh I think most of us were already inside raiding by that time lol
---
There’s not even that many horde players in Org, UC and TB combined on my server.
---
It’s stories like these that make ganking so fun.
---
Same but alliance :(
---
I am going to watch that movie tonight =)
---
Good thinking all ive done so far is kit all my toons out with mooncloth bags and i still have a fair few in the bank too
---
I got peer pressured by retail guildies to play horde because there we are a horde guild ... started on firemaw only to know they switched to gandling day 2 , when I was already level 23 with a couple golds in my bags . I rerolled on gandling and now I'm not even playing in the same guild as them . My true nostalgia trip would have been night elf warrior , oh well "times change" .
---
To be fair though on gandling I feel the factions are quite balanced and on the norm even during phase 1 I felt like alliance were more pvp-aggressive than us . 
---
Horde on gandling brought me to believe they were retail alliance who made the switch to horde to try be the dominant faction but everytime pvp goes on they actively avoid it
---
Ya but the horde players reaction is hilarious.
---
No it's not
---
This is the best post in this subreddit. Maybe it loses to Chromie dancing.
---
No, that guy is being a huge downer/just trolling. Over the course of 6 months with blizzard dishing out content I'd expect 75% of the playerbase to remain at worst, and on bigger servers there will probably still be occasional queues at peak times.
---
Outro*
---
Iirc blizzard have pretty tricky tos in this case like all characters are actually own by blizzard.
---
As we said in the video, SL is a faceroll and a joke of a spec overall - it's what you play if you want to actively avoid learning how to properly play the class.
---
WPL/EPL, away from the flightpaths if on a pvp server
---
Nope.
---
I know it's not hard. We'd not had problems before so this was simply an unexpected happening. Me and another person will be logging as well from now on.
---
Been high all those years or what?:O
---
If you say so big boy
---
There is also a chance you played on low pop server before. What's your current server?
---
Crusader is unbeatable as an enchant for DPS.
---
It's not supposed to be fun.  It's farming.  Imagine the most boring farming you've ever done.  Imagine there are 40 other players all waiting for the same spawns.  And the drop rate is terrible.  Now imagine that in order to get the item you're trying to farm, you have to farm this crowded-ass spot more in a week than 99.9% of people on your server.  For weeks and weeks in a row.  Fuck that.  
---
That's why I rolled pve to begin with.  I had no interest in putting myself through that.   People had this kind of nostalgia for phase 2 but it was bound to be a shitshow this time around.  The game is already solved, everyone already knew before launch day what the BiS items were for each phase.  And they knew which of those items came from PvP rewards.  All the PvE content is basically on farm already for anyone that's serious about it, what did you think everyone wasn't going to move on and do whatever they could to farm the next set of content too?  
---
I really think Blizzard should've rethought this phase launch schedule.  They didn't release BGs along with honor rewards because you have to have a "phase 2" period to be "true" to the vanilla experience.  But then they went ahead and released Dire Maul early (#nochanges).  So that when phase 2 hit it was really only PvP content (honor and world bosses).  There was no PvE content for players to explore at the same time, which might've spread the playerbase out a bit.  Everyone went straight into farming honor. Now they're gonna release BGs on their own and queues are gonna suck for weeks.  Horde players will get their chance to complain on Reddit.  That will go on for a while until phase 3 hits and then finally there's some more content for everyone to farm all at once.  
---
And of course all of that is compounded by Blizzard's failures since before launch to control server population and faction balance.  They underestimated the number of servers they needed at launch, added additional servers too late, bungled their attempts to use server transfers which led to a positive feedback loop of faction imbalance.
---
Not your traditional game. Warriors of magic and might 4 I believe is the name. Age of empires 2 sorta genre except for the fighting. Very out dated game
---
Similar thing happened to me except I got into BRD and said “I’ll brb gonna grab a drink”. Came back to being back in Org, msged him something very similar.  He told me they needed a mage, which was fine but why let me run all the way to BRD and then on top of it, kick me back to Org.

Well yeah raid reset day always cray tho
---
Hey,
---
congratz on making the research. Ozgar's calculator is a resource that could be useful to you if you'd like to compare HpM and HpS at different levels of gear.
---
https://www.wowdownrank.com
---
From personal experience:
---
If you're in a progress phase where tanks can still die in a 3s window, focus on HpS instead of mana efficiency. It's better to have some overheal or non-optical HpM rather having key people down.
---
If your raid is in a phase where the fights are drawn out to the point that healers have no problem keeping people alive in the first minutes, but go OOM in the end, be more agressive with downranking or cancelling casts.
---
If you're on the fence between +mana and +healing, go for healing power. There are easier ways to recover mana (potions, runes...) than to add raw healing.
---
In 5-men where you're the only healer, you can really leverage HpM and downranking, until you get to the point where the HpS gets so low that things become dangerous, which is Heal 1, renew &lt;6 and Heal 2 if you still have low-ish +healing
---
In raid environments, there are situations where healers do not communicate and somebody snipes a fast heal in the last 0.5s of your pre-cast, mana efficient Heal, or replaces your renew with a higher rank. As a result don't fret too much about optimization of overheal or HpM.
---
Enlighten us with a route that doesn't involve death or some horde main path. Killing a level 28-42 though, nice.
---
only overpower if  you have less than 25 rage
---
What would be the lore reason behind ur faction charging more just because there is more people?
---
And how would this idea work into the idea of their being no major changes?
---
&gt;That will still be minmaxed as much as possible, minmaxing will mever go away, regardless of classic+ or tbc.
---
Sure, but it won't be min-maxed nearly as hard.
---
For instance, righ tnow. As a lock, there is  no absolutely for me to roll/waste my DKP on a chest, leggings or boots. Because I know that in 2 patches, anything I obtain will be inferior to the bloodvine set (which is easy to obtain, and you can just buy it off the AH). And you have basically the entire expansion planned out with every patch figured out.
---
In TBC, everyone will just reroll horde and play at least hunters (best class in TBC), or warlock. and if I play warlock in TBC I know if I craft my spellfire/Frozenshadoweave I will be decked out until like Black temple if not sunwell. Because I know how every path will play out, and what will be optimal in every patch.
---
Lets say Blizzard launch a patch 1.14, and add a new raid. And lets say they remove the debuff cap (which is the first that should gone from new raids in classic +), now maybe the entire game changes just because of that. Shadow priests might be way more viable, along with locks.
---
They could internal testing only (like I wish they were doing on retail, but that game is way more technical complex and prone to more bugs due to layering, phasing all the shit that game has). So if they just do releases as they used to, and not have a billion youtubers play thorugh the content months before release, I do believe you could have the exploration aspect back in the game.
---
The part of the Full House intro where the singer says "the milkman, the paper boy", repeated infinitely*
---
My wife got her eye, I got mageblade, and my best friend got Hunter shoulders on his first MC run ever, all in the same night. RNGesus be praised!
---
I mean it's not me saying it, it's a fact. Go look at the rankings on Warcraftlogs, check all the top guilds, every single one has Warriors top by a mile, then Rogues and Warlocks are at the bottom. I checked your logs and you're doing well, but the rest of your guild are not,    your melee are underperforming massively, so I can understand why you have a skewed view on things.
---
The game is full of mouth breathers who get satisfaction from killing people 5+ levels below them. These same people would never do arena if it existed in Classic
---
Ya, was a delightful little Easter egg for beating game on Legendary difficulty :). Thanks for the great vid!
---
Yea I'm sure they'll leave it as is to please the nostalgia-chasers.  Wish they'd try to craft the game around it's intended design and not how the players abused various things.
---
Nah, we kill Gnomes on sight. Shit talking just makes the kill extra sweet.
---
Yes horde was the lesser faction until the blood elves came out.

I started discovering these after i hit lvl 10, and went to dungeons after that,but u can start discovering earlier since u can enter low lvl dungeons at lvl 10 (found out this later).
---
Yeah when they die from a dot and they just flip and die, such drama queens haha
---
there's always someone looking to be offended
---
Sounds like using addons happened on a erver you can use addons on.
---
Wash yer back!
---
You say that like guilds are actually capping debuff slots and/or care that much about it..
---
Yea it's obvious when there's a mortal strike there, makes it easier to see who doesn't get loot.
---
wow
---
that is an AMAZING instantaneous headache
---
Like he mentioned earlier he is going to be the nightfall bot of the guild. I think he deserves it more than a resto too, mainly because of the reason I mentioned above.
---
Feel better!
---
I don't get it. Must have something to do with playing on a pve server xD
---
Are you quitting because of this crappy neck piece of because people are shitheads on a videogame? Genuinely curious.
---
2 tanks per raid, 4? (correct me if i'm wrong) lotus per hour. 96 Lotus per 24 hour = 48 raids with flasks on a 2 hour duration, 24 raids with four hours per raid night. Doesn't even include supreme power for fire mages. You can discount wisdom + melee titan flasks.
---
Well it is their main spec, so I don't think that's too outrageous.
---
According to wow head it is
---
In Cata/retail? Yea
---
Isn't t1 just better
---
Some shamans will keep it forever, thats how good it is.
---
Might have nothing to do with pvp and they’re just waiting for more raid content
---
Its tank prio, then rogue
---
how the fuck do i download on that site
---
You just wait until you get T2/3 and become an unkillable god who can heal through anything
---
Sure it’s not an add-on causing it?
---
And yet alliance is being absolutely dominated and literally leaving the game in numbers because they can't handle the current state of pvp. Even on realms closer to 50 50 this is true. You saying that alliance is better either means you are wrong or alliance is not skilled in classic. I do believe that horde are more pvp focused but I can't believe that theres this many bad alliance players.
---
I dont know why you get downvoted because this is exactly what it is and still some people are like stop crying blabla , in fact they dont want to deepbrain things and are just lazy and what everything easily which was the complete opposite in 2004 , glad to see someone thinking the same as i do
---
DO NOT fly to Morgan’s vigil.. fly to red ridge and walk along south.
---
Like they're fishing for a red card lol
---
Your poor Tanks. Literally best TPS weapon right now
---
Looks more of a scarlet color to me
---
Block him so you dont see his posts, it's great.
---
WTF? I want them to get que fast so they are not out ganking
---
As a warrior tank, I'd never refuse a shaman. Dungeons just run so much smoother due to their utility.
---
I've never seen the additional bounces proc Mana Surge. The additional bounces also don't occur if there are no injured targets in range.
---
However, the additional bounces do proc both Ancestral Healing and Healing Way - which spreads them quickly.
---
In raids, Healing Wave pretty much replaces Chain Heal - it's higher throughput and better mana efficiency (depending on rank). At full rank, your healing output is incredible.
---
So bad acting lol
---
The only thing better than levelling up with a Flurry Axe is levelling up with *two* Flurry Axes!
---
Holy DPS Disc/Holy Priest!
---
[Something like this!](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/055100130505051-00545100202-1)
---
Stack it with a Ret Paladin for 10% extra holy damage through Sanctity Aura and Judgement of the Crusader, and I think it could be a good bit of fun! Getting gear for it would obviously be a pain as priest tier gear has +healing so you'd have to yoink mage/warlock gear, but what the hell. BD
---
Why would anyone report those ppl for saying ok boomer or go back to Retail  jesus
---
Fast MH is preferred in BWL and many boss fights because of cleave.
---
Tanks want a fast MH because of heroic strike spam. Its their best TPS weapon.
---
When you say it sucks you make yourself look stupid unless you specify in what way you mean. You don’t need spell hit for pvp nor do you need to stack that spell power, if someone is thinking about things differently than you are and you say it sucks, to them you look ignorant of how the game works in the same way they probably look ignorant to you
---
You also play on the majority side (horde) on a server where people are constantly complaining about how horribly imbalanced it is.
---
"oh look guys it isn't that bad" ...yeah it isn't that bad for you because all the alliance are dead and camped by the superior horde numbers.
---
But I can't play furry as alliance until the Worgen come out!
---
Well, cross-faction communication isn’t allowed.
---
I am aware and it sucks i get it i understand but we cant jsut wait till BGs because all the PvPers who are going to be in BGs will have been farmign already and will be several ranks ahead and with better PvP gear leaving us at a disadvantage so we farm
---
Ah yes another "STOP UNDERCUTTING ME!!!!11!!!1!1!" post.
---
Either you are valuing the goods too high and the market is correcting or they are valuing the goods too low and you need to stop complaining and buy them out for resale.
---
There is no "ruining the market" going on, youre just too lazy to play it correctly
---
I got bre 4 weeks ago..thank you rngesus
---
I'm the gnome betting blasted :( I had just returned from trying to level in Searing Gorge at 5 AM with no luck because of the honor patrols - naturally I brought some salt with me to IF where I see hordes farming honor by oneshotting lowbies in the commons and then immediately dying. I let out my bitter frustration and then I get absolutely deleted instantly. It is not staged and I admit this scene is fucking hilarious
---
I leveled full prot and the same thing was true.  Its just hard whenever you hop into a new dungeon.
---
"Tonight" was yesterday Monday night heh.  
---
Tuesday is for raiding.  It is known. :)
---
They know that. They don't care.
---
God is dead and we have killed him
---
I don't think you understood the analysis if you believe that both sides would be precisely equally over-represented. Why do you believe the horde would be over-represented?
---
Is buying Runecloth Bag and Runecloth Gloves recipe off the auction house my best bet?
---
Found the horde
---
Would be a lot easier to say if people just stopped removing our fear.
---
Meanwhile they are 900g on Earthshaker.
---
I responded to him being called a noob, not him being an insane player. Here's a definition for you btw, so you know what it means :)
---
Definition of noob:
---
\-  a newbie, especially a person who is new to an online community and whose online participation and interactions display a lack of skill or knowledge
---
Here use this: http://www.wowdownrank.com/
---
you might be able to farm the mine in blasted lands. lowest mob is 47ish? i was desperate oh my warrior and only saw one alliance member in there. nowhere else was safe while i was leveling in my 50s.
---
Yikes, someone has a master's degree in Tumblr Studies
---
Lol how did you check my logs
---
Amen, hope this works and hope it makes some horde players quit.
---
Now lets step back a little bit here. I really want players on the horde side on my server to quit because I hate them. I get angry when I see the other faction now. Blizzard's design here is brilliant, I can't think of a single other form of media that generates this much of an emotional response. You can see this playing out all across this subreddit.
---
is there some aucton house addon that lets me scan ah,and they displays lowest price when i hover on item in my inventory ?
---
Dying*
---
what you just told is nonsence. In cease of cleave everybody wants slow MH due to heavy cleave and WW
---
Whenever I find a great deal on an item that can help my warrior friend level I snag it and mail it to him. Destiny was a recent one of these. Got it for 20g. I'll probably buy him the mats for sader chant once he can use it in 5ish levels. 
---
Possible he might replace it before lvl 60 but until then it should prove to work out nicely for him. My understanding is they tend to want a slow weapon but it should still beat out many blues he will have access to once he can use it.
---
I'm horde side and normally I'd think this tactic is just ugly as it ruins gameplay in a way that was never intended....but I'm entirely aware of how horde (and alliance on alliance dominated servers) are driving players crazy just trying to get into raids or 5-mans in BRM.
---
Teach those damn gankers a lesson (because once it gets fixed, the issue with horde harassing players trying to get into BRM STILL won't have been dealt with).
---
Yeah it happens every time I run into blackrock mountain and my group of 5 gets trucked by 200 players of the other faction. World PVP is griefing. PVP servers were a mistake.
---
No, that's why you have 8 tanks. Technically its' possible with 6.
---
wrong
---
But did you die?
---
You're not *competing*, if there's nothing to heal, don't heal.
---
If other people want to inefficiently heal with max rank flash heal, let them. As long as people don't die, you've done your job.
---
Got a laundry list there, brother. I have faith the coming weeks will be prosperous for your group. You must as well! Believe! Have faith!
---
Forgot how, wasn't bothered to check keybinds.
---
3 min mage?
---
Let's be honest, you kill all alliance on sight.
---
It does. Says &lt;Holy Strenght&gt;
---
I want off my PVP server and I don't want to re-roll. PVP servers were a mistake.
---
Don't try scholo or strath either. Alliance flight paths are prime horde honor farming spots.
---
That is super odd. Anyhow, you will be hard pressed finding well itemized pieces with SP and other desirable tank stats - and I have a hard time believing that the ratio would be as good as you state, but I obviously just hear about it now. To get 100% bonus of your +healing (assume it is the same for +sp) a spell must have a base cast time of 3.5, if it has 2 sec cast the coefficient is (2/3.5) and so on. 
---
And +sp/heal won't affect health regen, as the stuff you get from Lifestone.
---
Why would you guilt them? If people aren't doing their due diligence on a 500 gold item, that's their fault. Plus you can cancel auctions.
---
The plainstriders are the best, they die crying like wtf not again i just respawned
---
Not once did I mention a weapon enchant, I’m talking about shield (supposedly confirmed in other threads), and trinkets
---
I levelled an undead rogue to 60 in phase one on faerlina, and then rerolled a human rogue on myzrael (pve) like a week before honor dropped. I'm currently level 55 and not experiencing any of the shitty parts of phase 2 and having lots of fun experiencing the alliance side of things.
---
If all the people complaining about phase 2 and how unplayable it is REALLY hated it, they would just reroll. Clearly they enjoy pve content, making another character is another opportunity for some levelling fun.
---
Or maybe I'm just an asshole for suggesting such a thing, who knows
---
I still remember back when google launched and thinking it would fail or disappear because it didn't have all that interesting stuff on the homepage like msn did, or when games started appearing in DVD cases instead of those huge boxes and thinking no way this is going to be a thing (cause seriously, who doesn't love those huge boxes?! They're awesome! I still have all mine!).
---
This is not talking about spells / cast times, that is completely irrelevant, this  is a weird phenomenon that relates to spell power interaction and passive item effects such as weapon procs, shield procs, and maybe trinkets (no one I’ve seen has tested this)
---
Is there a caster with 30g to spare willing to buy the trinket and test it on their toon with trinket on vs off to compare HP5?
---
Personally for me being in guild that requires some kind of commitment is a good thing. Sure in past days when I was in school and my life was around school and video games it was easier. I spent \~6 hours in a day in school, mom made me food and washed my clothes and all my friends played WoW. Now that I have family and full time job I just can't spare spending three days in a week trying to clear MC because "we are not geared, we are playing for fun".
---
And tbh getting pre raid BiS is one of easiest tasks in WoW. If you manage to get to level 60, you can easily manage to gather good amount of pre BiS gear.
---
57 prot warrior checking in. Can confirm
---
Had a friend that put up freezing band for 7g by accident
---
In my eyes it is. Why? Because he’s probably done all by himself. Rag day5 is sure and impressive achievement, however it’s 39 others in the raid and you’ve probably not even levelled by yourself. 
---
For a solo-achievement is way more valuable than a group one.
---
I stopped making Mooncloth about 2 weeks ago. That's the state on Grobbulus Alliance.
---
DHK
---
Yes
---
RL?
---
Besides raiding, running around on top of the bank is all I do.
---
I've known about cast time based coefficients.  Do you know instant cast by chance? Or are all instant spells different?
---
20g? No way it was way more than that at the start. 20g is when I started to get depressed because the price was going down.
---
Auctioneer does this. It's a nice, relatively lightweight auction addon.
---
Tradeskillmaster does this as well, and a lot of stuff on top of it, to the point where it can be really confusing to a newcomer. So I recommend Auctioneer.
---
there is literally no mace that will hit harder than 105dmg for 39 twinks thats whay BIS means but ok
---
You'd have to Google, but coefficients for instant casts are way lower than (longer) casted spells.
---
AP POM Pyro pop AP trinkets and melt everything once every 3 minutes.
---
A good healer is god tier in PvP in every game. Looking back, it's probably what got me addicted to healing back in the day.
---
Thx
---
Most Hordes come from Kargath because you can Hearthstone to it and the flight from UC takes forever.
---
Is this some sort of PvP server joke that I'm too PvE to understand?
---
&gt; On retail
---
https://i.imgur.com/sfqrtCK.png
---
Talk shit get hit lol
---
I dont see Crappeh? The nr1 pvp'er on the server
---
My server is at or close to 50, I’m dying to alliance quite often. For example, I do a lot of farming in Azshara. I’ll say I encounter maybe 3-4 1v1 situations per hour there usually and maybe 1 1v2 per hour. No problem, I enjoy PvP. But...every time, and I mean every time, I have to make the flight from Org to Azshara there’s 5-6 alliance camping the flight path. I could land on the FP and die to them then rez over and over and continuously die then cry on Reddit about it...*or*...I could buy a stack of lesser invis potions, die one time when landing potentially but escape and go to farming as soon as I retrieve my corpse. They’re not leaving the FP to hunt one person down.
---
&gt;"Is that gnome talking shit? Hold my beer." Horde probably
---
It got scrapped because we no longer want to be happy for the things we know are coming, but rather for random dungle boomper blorps.
---
I cast one more spell at their corpses just to make sure they're not feigning
---
I'm not debating DPS warriors capability to tank. I'm debating their willingness. Many warriors down right refuse to do any sort of tanking. They are in for a rude awakening.
---
More gear means more Stamina which helps you stay alive, along with more armor - which in addition to improved inner fire and imp PW:S talents, makes us pretty tanky against those melee. Against 1 or 2, you should be able to stay alive long enough for teammates to take them down.
---
/u/raretendies 
---
[This should elucidate things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mBqm8uO4Cg)
---
They're most definitely banned for spamming, rather than the actual message. Try typing a slur in tradechat occasionally, not enough to disturb people, but enough for anyone to be able to notice it, nothing will happen. But the second you start spamming even something innocent in tradechat, or any public chat for that matter, you're gonna get a 3-day mute. If they weren't banned for spamming, I'd bet a lot that they just happened to piss off a GM that shit his pants and banned them.
---
Not far off then haha
---
It falls off quite a bit, but it's still a decent stat. Crit and AP is better though.
---
Don't listen to the other guy, for MH daggers +5 weapon damage is actually superiour. Put crusader on offhand.
---
That’s why i haven’t touched retail after LFR
---
As frustrating as it is, preventing players of the other faction from having access to key quest items and loot from instances is very well within the spirit of World PvP, even moreso than these roving deathballs that are going around. If you deny the other side items, or at least make them pay in honor, it makes it harder to get gear to fight you with. I agree, faction imbalance and larger than healthy server sizes makes the game frustrating but camping questers looking for a prebis item is actually the way the game should be played, not ganking lone lvl 52s who just landed at a flight path for 30 minutes as a 40 man
---
"oh no, people make use of a working mechanic in the game but Im not having fun, lets change how the game works."
---
Whoosh.
---
&gt; Also vanish still needs to be fixed
---
I read another rogue, who wrote that when you drop vanish just stand still for 2-3 sec. If you move, theres a chance its gonna fail.
---
I haven't tested it out yet, maybe you will?
---
So when u use pve gear to kill people in pvp is not pvp???? Like wtf u mean, there have been worse pve item that destroy u in pvp but thats not pvp right?
---
What's usual reply time for stuff like this? No hear from Blizz for days now.
---
Wait until Naxx and warlocks will be able to crit like that like it's nothing. They will also be able to flat out onehit anything that isn't a straight up tank with 10K+ HP, frequently enough for it to be completely infuriating.
---
To be clear, if A attacks B, it will not start B's autoattack. He will just stand there until the player does something.
---
Lograine is killed by sapping one add and blinding the other, unload DPS on Lograine and then loot + vanish once he is dead.
---
Spazzing is killed by LOS:ing him around the corner where you throw the beer. Don't get hit by Immolate and try to avoid Shadowbolts.
---
it's not rocket science.  
---

must not be on a full server. You will get ganked on the ramp and sent back to the thorium point GY where the deathrun is even longer.
---
Don't mix "merciless gladiator gear" with "merciless gladiator title" (rank 1 title). The only way they would be able to sell the title was to play the account, and it would be for something like 1000$ at least, not gold.
---
ive mostly been playing retail since im alliance on Herod outside of raids. it isnt that i dont like pvp, but unfortunately with my limited play time, im not corpse running everywhere.
---
Thoroughly enjoyed your writing, thank you
---
We’ll just fly into Thorium, all 40 at once
---
It’s pre raid bis
---
Yep tab targeting will help.  Be careful in dungeon groups not to tab target mobs that are off to the side though
---
Also do you have your spells key bound?
---
Typically newb is used in reference to those that are new at something. Noob is used a more broad insult meaning you’re bad at something (and not necessarily new). You must be a newb to noobness.
---
Some of us don't have a couple hours to farm 2-3 times a week.
---
It took me days of trying at logging random hours to try and get it done only for it to bug out or get ganked or open a chest in the room and lose your disguise or a priest dispelled it. This was before layering. If I’m ever in the area you bet I’ll be stopping by there to repay the bloodshed.
---
How do you get to 800 DPS on single target without world buffs? Do you need recklessness to hit that?
---
I have OEB and do around 600 DPS without recklessness.
---
No, back in vanilla if you were level 60, you only had 10 levels to get to max level again once tbc came out. 
---
Shadowlands will have the first ever level squish in WoW
---
Most warriors from pservers would probably agree that horde is more fun, but not thanks to windfury, but thanks to elemental shamans and their on-demand burst. Shamans is the sole reason that alliance tend to turtle and outlast the horde rather than going on the offensive, since overextending means a giga quick death when you're against an elemental shaman.
---
Shadowlands is the first player level squish ever.
---
Tough, there have been item level squishes in the past, but none while I played (until Cataclysm)
---
Shadowlands Will bring the first " level reset" 
---
We don't know how they will be doing tbc launch if they ever will, no info yet. Keep in mind anything after classic is at least 1 or 2 years away
---
There are good servers where people are having a blast, there are shit servers where people are miserable, and the "sunken cost fallacy" is a thing. Do with this information what you will.
---
I bought it for 15g, its great
---
Yeah being opened to criticism is critical, especially if you never tanked Vanilla raids before.
---
Listen to the people that did it. I healed Vanilla and had no clues about 3 or 4 important things that OG tanks told me to do. Much better now.
---
Alright so westfall is only there since i made this list while playing hunter so i need tunic of westfall and you need to run around there anyway for that quest chain. Redridge is nice place for kicking low levels as horde and nice place to counter-twinking as an ally, duskwood is mostly same as redridge, tanaris is mega fun as a twink raid if you find nice big twinking guild. Arathi same since there is big horde quest hub. And as for thousand needles its basicly same as duskwood on ally side. But obviously this is pretty hardcore and made from alliance view point. Im pretty big for wpvp so same of these are a bit extra if u want to mostly focus on wgs.
---
No. EPGP is basically DKP, except you set it so it has a weekly decay, and you set it high enough that people will get to a sort of soft-cap that you're wasting EP, to encourage people to actually spend it on gear so it doesn't go to waste and not hoard. Nothing to do with your current gear. 
---
It also has a fixed cost per item based on what the item slot is and the item level of it (usually), instead of bidding which can be controlled by having people who want the same stuff in agreement to just bid super low. For example, my guild in classic (I don't raid) has dkp, and all the Hunters have been colluding to not spend more than the minimum dkp and just let whoever has the highest dkp bid, and because there's noone else rolling on their gear, they get more dkp overall to roll on stuff like the ring from rag that everyone else needs, and no other class can even get close.
---
Obviously there's more to it, but they're the major points DKP lacks.
---
Is it possible to check your GUID?
---
You should talk to someone. Mate. Not good thoughts. No shame and going to have a chat :)
---
Sorry for reposting but mods did removed the original post cause the twitch link didnt work for everyone. Just reuploaded it cause I think its a funny clip.
---
One thing to note is that its my guildie who is in the clip - not me. So if you wanna give me pointers in playing Paladin dont bother cause its not me and I play a Warrior :) .
---
 We laughed very hard at this so I thought I might share :)

Lol that’s my normal experience when I get back to if. Some random rogue is usually hiding by Ginny Longberry. Being a gnome always puts a big target on me D:

Odds are that AV will have much longer queues than wsg/AB so expect horde to come in as a massive premade as they likely will have to wait 30m+ for 1 AV queue to pop. Thanks to this, after people are done farming their rep it's very likely that horde will consistently stomp alliance.
---
Yeah it’s mainly a weapon issue, gear to me is fair game but a core hound tooth or Brut blade on a Hunter over a rogue or fury warrior, god no
---
Healing is useless in pvp.. Ok? You do realise the entire tide of a battle can be changed with a crit heal more than a crit fireball. I've seen it turn battles in a snap. It's extremely good.
---
"I'm not dead yet!"
---
"You soon will be"

"I feel fine!"

Willing to bet they change this b4 BGs come out. Lets face it, no changes in a world where everyone can get this information so easily is just a bad idea. I love it because its troll as fuck but if its that easy its only a matter of time til it happens to you and you legit didnt even know what happened because some mage in your BG was just doing his job
---
It has.
---
No, it's only griefing if you're making it impossible to do anything in the game. You could just skip the quest. If you're getting corpse-camped, you could just have a warlock summon you and spam accept, and go so something in a zone where you're not getting corpse-camped.
---
Maybe it's just me but I would be hella pissed for a level reset in a new expansion lol. I hate the item squish enough already. (Now then it's not like I play Retail but if I did I'd hate this)
---
Hammer of the Vendor or whatever it’s called
---
Go around it? Like when u get into tirisfall run north till u hit water then run east? 
---
What I would do back then I would go to hillsbrad. Run to the dal bubble and swim to the northern tip of silver pine. Then I would run north west till I got “around brill” then north east. Never had any problems.
---
Just use ur brain lol.  If you really assume that the only way to get there is to run on a road from southshore. Your dumb for projecting that information like it is the only way.
---
10/10 this guy is a shit talker on a discord or something and the horde just targets him so they can harvest his salt.
---
Depends on how you wanna play. If you are in a minmaxing guild, yeah, ofcourse pom matters since you'll get an extra frostbolt off during power infusion. If you don't care and just wanna mess around, sure it doesn't matter, you could win MC with everyone being aoe/lulz/pvp spec ;p

I mean it can probably work well in MC gear already and he might get some nice parses for a tank, but I don't know what crit caps fury/prot should aim for and how attainable those are at the moment. And still, it should be used to allow for DPS to pull out the stops a bit more, I'm not sure the current gearing for DPS necessitates that type of threat regen, save perhaps outside of the first few seconds of a pull.
---
Lifestone Passive: nope  
---
Lifestone use: nope

Slime Shoulders: nope
---
That’s something I hope a mmo does again.
---
I play dnd and it’s amazing to come up with a strat to bodyblock a doorway and fire behind the frontline with fireballs into a hoard of zombies.  ( we had a left 4 dead dnd campaign) it would change how Pvp works. You can just run though people like that. You’ll have to do what soldiers did in 1300. Fight or die :)
---
sir, when I explore an area, I have to explore each region within the region right? For example, If I explore Xroad, am I set for all the other areas or do I have to go to each place? If so, is there a rule that I can follow so that I can explore all areas of a region?
---
Most PvE realms are alliance dominated, and alliance were the ones who rerolled PvE for the most part. If they're not in the same battlegroup as PvP servers, alliance literally rerolled themselves from 0 minute queues to 30 minute queues.
---
I've got a lvl 49 warlock and I'm getting trashed by lvl 60s. I want to source demonology to be able to survive. Good idea?
---
Got my leaf from MC a day after p2 hit. I had to take a day off from work to get up at 5.45am to get those shit demons in WS and BS. So I feel what you are going throug. If I were you, I would just say fuck it and go for ony neck. There is also a quest-neck in strath. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
---
I agree with you, but that doesnt change the point. Some people would be best off rerolling on a new server if they want to keep playing. The fact that this is their best option to enjoy the game is a problem - that is the point.
---
U SiGnEd Up FoR ThIs
---
Should have rolled over
---
Git gud
---
Well yes but did you see your bindings lol scrub
---
Think that covers it /end thread
---
stfu
---
&gt; Heard about them ninjaing loot multiple times, by swapping to masterloot before a boss etc, or just not letting anyone else roll or just ignoring a roll and giving gear to their own players. 
---
I'm sure most if not all guilds have done this, issue is when it's not communicated clearly enough and someone gets sand in the V. A Larger guild means more chance of this happening.
---
&gt;Multiple members bot and used afk programs to make money the first cpl weeks. 
---
I know of one person who got banned a few months back for fish botting, again I'm sure multiple guilds have had at least one person banned so let's get those pitch forks ready!
---
&gt;Shared accounts. 
---
Pitch forks are getting raised up folks!!!!
---
&gt;Reset mc/ony.

Never once, I will bet my entire flask / Black lotus stash on this ( see below )
---
&gt;Layer abused and locked all devilsaur down the first 2 weeks, ontop of rich thoriums/lotus. 
---
You're god damn right we did and you would have been a fool to not do that for gold or XP advantages. All the crystals and lotuses I obtained help set me up personally for a very, VERY long time in classic. If you want to cry about your devilsaur leather go to Ungoro now, nobody cares.  
---
&gt;Private server group of try hards who mass invited and fed all the gear to their core 20-25 members, who have been playing on private servers for years and I was told they had a shitty reputation on each one they played on before too. 
---
Sure, I like to be competitive on the PVE and PVP side of things, I have an alt druid and lock which I do not care about to help funnel gear to literally anyone else over these alts, but the core is in fact hopefully much MUCH higher than 20-25 given how many MCs we do. As for our reputation, maybe they hate us because they ain't us? I really hope you were that awful shaman who messaged me a few times when you wanted me to hold your hand and tell you everything will be ok because you didn't get such and such item. Every item that has dropped, will drop again many many times and it's never ok to cry about loot you special little snowflake.

Docx

You forgot blessing of sacrifice which makes it so they cant be cc'd.

When the tank gets back to secure threat
---
It's almost like the games are set in the same universe. Playful joke, don't hate me.
---
This is how its supposed to be. Alliance vs Horde. Fucking over the opposite faction as hard as possible is the point.
---
Do this, OP!
---
When a bear and an eagle love each other very much...

Congratz, you're both fucking stupid.

Once he casts it at someone; just keep doing the hokey-cokey. About to cast it, run out - has cast it, run in.
---
Omg. This is my friends gif I shared on discord. I'm Smudge in it haha.
---
There is an animation after the timer is done when he uses Wrath, i think he also says some voiceline when he casts it.
---
If you already have DBM you can check for the "Wrath of Ragnaros" annoucement after the timer is done, there is one for when he uses the ability.
---
You don’t have to exploit to get there, you literally just walk through the mountains and slowfall down
---
Someone is jealous that someone was smart and rolled the class that can deny the honor of stupid gankers :P.
---
One tip is to list things for 8 hours and do it at around 4 o'clock. This saves you a fair amount on the deposit and you are still selling throughout peak times when stuff is most likely to sell anyway.
---
Yes it does. That's why I said it. And so did the guy screaming in the video.
---
Oh another one of those “alliance are the victims “people
---
Someone from Zandalar Tribe, Mograine, etc post a picture here please to shut this idiot up
---
no person has 8k gold lying around, of course the guild's gonna help the other guy
---
Took me several days of waking up and trying to do it 6am before I got it. It's brutal.
---
not for a main - but I’m going to make an agility stacking mage twink for wanding at level 29. i did it on private servers so not guaranteed to work but it is low key disgusting- the frost kiting is like a hunters wet dream and with pseudo best in slots and enchants you can get up to 30% crit with dumb attack speed. its not amazing but its really fun and people don’t expect it so they ignore your wands often until its too late
---
We have a shaman healing our MT on Ragnaros. He ends the fight with almost 30% mana left, spamming Healing Wave throughout the fight. I can't tell if it goes all the way back to melee, but you shouldn't be worried about that. All that is important is you've got a healer that increases your MT's Armor with excessive mana regeneration keeping him available 100% for your MT.
---
Want to take the outliers as the normal? I'm the idiot... Yea ....
---
Meanwhile I'm here wondering what everyone's problem with the Horde is, as my level 55 UD Lock is getting destroyed every other minute. Turns out I'm on one of those rare balanced servers and there's assholes on both sides.
---
You said that as a point to disprove what he said with saying, this is a mc raiding group going to raid. I’m confused to why you replied.
---
Cuz he bad
---
As someone from Morgraine (horde), there definitely is Alliance. Its roughly 50:50 still.
---
No, quit bitching.
---
you frequently fly over the place, if getting there would be punishable that would be more than ridiculous
---
Pretty much any can do this I think. I use grid2.
---
Like, you created an alt alliance side and asked the guy?
---
The obvious thing your friend needs to practice on is setting his hearth to the inn in darkshore.
---
It was never taken down by the mods. Hell, I know u/SoupaSoka left quite a few comments there discussing the discovery.
---
The guy who posted it manually deleted it himself, which is why links to the post through other redditors' comments show the text as [deleted] rather than [removed].
---
Hand of lost deposit.
---
OPie looks like exactly what I need. Thanks ever so much for recommending it. I've seen several games use this kind of user interface, I didn't even consider looking for something like this in WoW.
---
People use shield in raids?
---
Its not fucked up at all.
---
Look into  **Ice Barbed Spear**. Its a quest reward from Hero of Stormpike/Frostwolf quest. Once the BGs will be out on 10th december the quest can be completed when on lvl 51 and with one win in AV. The spear is much better than anything at level 51 and might help your friend on his way to 60
---
Hai arugal and your 14fps on my very fancy computer
---
Yes it's insanely good to have access to the silence, mana burn &amp; spamming rank 1 sw pain that will stun or waste a despell. You will be a weaker healer and basically should focus on alot of mana until you get good gear. I used to play this alot on vanilla private servers
---
Seems people are shit at corpse jumping. You dont ress when there is 5+ people waiting for you to ress.. you chill a bit and wait for them to go running after their next victim, ress and mount up while they are distracted for 5 seconds.
---
Yes explain why every fury switches to fast MH in cleave fights in later phases? Explain that. Right you can't.  
---
The rage generation is so high in later phases that you have a 100% uptime on cleave, faster MH is better for that than a slow in terms of DPS.
---
You did not mention DPS or Tanks. Besides, tanks are also fury.
---
Bubble with swiftness pots makes it a lot more bearable.
---
There has never been a level reset in wow history. Players would have lost their shit if we had to re level vanilla and then go to the outlands.
---
very accurate Server-population description
---
Just... why?
---
Worm.
---
Is...... nostalius dying?
---
Hah, that's what you get for gank-camping Morgan's Vigil! :P
---
Right Click on the map icon of atlas loot. It opens a menu of your character. Then select settings and there is an option to "add new list". The create how many lists you want and name them what you want in the same interface.
---
Close the settings menu and back to the menu with your character, you can now switch between lists.
---
Select a list and then trawl through the dungeon loot. See something you want, alt+left click.
---
When that item drops, a star appears next to the item and it tells you which list this is from.
---
As you progress through end game you would naturally delete pre raid BiS from the list and update the list to MC / Ony / BWL etc loot
---
Not if you spec DW fury.
---
Why didn't the retribution paladin have priority?
---
Thank you for everyone that's made suggestions. I really appreciate it. I'm going to use OPie and rebind all my spells. I haven't taken a good look at the layout since around level 40, now 53. I already use modifiers like shift, alt and ctr. I have a mouse with around 12 buttons, and I'm happy with it, so I'll stick with it for now. My main used to be a rogue - which has no where near as many spells - so I just need to find room for the most important.
---
If anyone reads this, and knows the answer, is Curse of shadows worth binding for pvp?
---
I mean... High charity and other Alli guilds have controlled BRM a lot. I've had to corpse run a lot as horde. You just have confirmation bias. 
---
I accept that raid night isn't exactly Alli friendly, but saying Yang always has BRM is a huge overstatement.
---
Does anybody know if DHK give dishonourable titles? Or have they been removed entirely?
---
I'm a mage, frostbite can proc on Ragnaros. It was a nice surprise when I found out (more crits due to shatter)
---
talk shit get hit 😤😤😤
---
Assuming frequent strong upgrades to both 1hs and 2h the standard 2h arms approach is superior.
---
However.
---
The different isn't very large, especially early on when overpower fishing dw arms is consistently stronger damage.
---
And.
---
1h upgrades are more plentiful and easier to come by.  The majority of the "best" 1hs while leveling are quest items from completing "do once" dungeon quests. Outlaw Sabre, Sword of Omen, Vanq Sword, Trashblade, etc.  The 2hs are either a longer quest (WW axe) or drops you are going to fight every pally/shaman or other warrior over, and you'll waste tons of time repeatedly forming groups for the same instance (ravager).
---
Considering how most people level and play dw arms or fury is going to be better.  Personally I don't switch to fury until ~53 because I want tactical mastery, but don't stress over picking arms or fury, it really doesn't matter.
---
Ahh so you sell gold. What server and whats ur rate
---
Like a week if that.
---
Best GIF of Classic so far !
---
Or more like you dont have anything to say to refute my points. Please, prove me wrong as to how going all the way into SL is better than just stopping at master summoner. Again, this isnt at 60 and their hp is only 2.2k.  
---
Theres also a difference between leveling and trying to pvp, idk why youd level going full demo first, drain tanking is the suggested build for a reason, but as someone who has leveled multiple locks and played one through multiple expacs and gotten glad with one, id love to learn more even now.
---
Hey this is us, &lt;Fury&gt;!  5 Raid groups running to MC.
---
&gt; SM - another hard one, damn these all-humanoid dungeons. Maybe a Hyena from Houndmaster
---
I would say a copy of the lvl 40 paladin mount, only in red/gold instead of blue/silver.
---
It didn't help you avoid ganks, it simply punished players ganking in specific cities. Most likely removed because it was an exploit
---
I've heard 24 hours game time. So you should be able to get it done in a AV weekend
---
After he says Taste the flames of Sulfuron
---
You only miss more with your off-hand, not with yellow attacks nor your main hand.
---
He shouts "Taste the Flames of Sulfuron" when he casts his melee knock back. Afterwards you can go back in provided a tank has aggro.
---
give this gif awards
---
And?
---
Why is anyone of any class expected or obligates to pass on an item they both need for a total stranger? 
---
If its a Warrior in my guild? Yeah sure, go for it. Random guy? I don't care what phase who replaces it.
---
When a gryphon got to get somewhere nothing getting in their way, not mountains, nothing!
---
To be honest I kill everyone on sight. 
---
If they would let me, I would kill everybody in my own faction as well.
---
Wow, who hurt you?
---
Yo is this V on Herod? Lmao
---
I can confirm this. Guild or of mine was spamming some dumb shit like Ok boomer or similar to the alliance (nothing racist). He was reported and while his report was pending GN review he was chat banned (could talk in guild and whispers but not chat/say). Eventually he was cleared with absolutely no consequences.
---
I dont see anyone ever actually advocating for no changes, but I sure do see a lot of people saying  **nO cHaNgEs** .   
---
And the eye does not give a DHK, this post and the previous one about the yeti are both bullshit, probably trolls or someone that saw the civilian tag and just assumed itd give a DHK.
---
Run faster
---
&gt;I would kill everybody in my own faction as well
---
Well, you should absolutely try "ArchAge". It is a "Sandbox MMO", so it is not for the faint of heart. 
---
But you are free to activate "Warmode" (can't remember the name exactly )  and go and kill your own faction.
---
"I make my own flight path".
---
Dont worry about your guild looking at you funny im the MT and the only tank without a quel :D
---
Addon probably made by a Horde scummer camping all the locations it sends you... right?
---
Haha I aint never goin into no truce with Aglais, any horde on Dreadmist who's ever been to BRD has had to fight him off at least once !
---
The other dude is probably thinking "There's no way he's that stupid. He's been playing the same game for the past 15 years"
---
Does it share cd with healthstone?
---
OK boomer
---
One more dagger rogue means one less sword rogue.

The one could discuss meme race fury with edgies as a third line for OH candidate. However as a fury you want CHT rather than perds for OH.

Not a cash maker but saves you another 80g!
---
Unless they’re human or orc and can make use of the weapon skill to get reduced miss, parry, dodge and glancing blows.
---
Horde on Gandling EU are the ones doing the ganking... How is it unsafe for you either way? :)
---
Same, but it makes sense. There is not much to do if you are not into pvp.
---
The only goal I have is to get more Lotuses, but that is lame as fuck
---
Our guild gives Rogues prio for this. All our tanks are Human and generally use swords or Eskhandar’s Claw.
---
That would have been a hilarious day for customer support of it did happen though
---
Relog and some patience. 
---
If it still hasn't updated by the afternoon you might want to do something about it.
---
Because becoming just like the people that ganked you somehow makes it okay now.
---
You forgot the most important one...
---
...looks like PvP happened on a PvP server.
---
same shit show as every week, probably get it by tomorrow.
---
Massive drop imho. Finding dungeons for lvl 60s will take a whil, leveling dungeons nearly impossible and there will be like at least just a third lf the guilds left and they will just raid log.
---
He shouldn't have been standing there

You said it yourself. Rng is rng. Past events don't affect future results. 
---
A coin could flip heads 50 times in a row but it doesn't make it more likely that tails is going to come up next coin toss. It's still a 50/50
---
&gt; but a Holy Paladin isn’t there to do damage, just to make space for the team and keep them alive.
---
you don't say. its almost as if a SL warlock was made to shut down enemy casters/healers. i said nothing about 1v1. i am talking about in a battleground scenario. 
---
warlock focus hpally, forces them to blow bubble literally in first 3-5 seconds or face death/go oom dispelling and healing themselves. while bubbles popped you switch targets, either peeling for someone on your team or fearing/tongues/whatever someone the pally isn't focused on, or if its just pally + 1 more person you can do direct damage to that one person. yes they will get healed while the pally is in bubble.
---
as soon as pally is out of bubble they're silenced, feared, should have multiple people on them, if its just you you have options, can run them out of mana easily with drain mana, chain dot fear, or just straight up blow them up when they're silenced + maybe one fear duration. 
---
again, if they send someone on you, you're SL. you're tankier than anyone but a bear form druid and prot warrior. 5k hp unbuffed, 30% damage reduction from all sources, 20%-ish armor, 89-129 magic res all schools unbuffed. healthstone, fel dom + vw sack for 2.6k shield....they send someone, 2 people even, to peel you off the pally and not are they only taking tons of resources away from other areas, they aren't gonna kill you in 3 seconds, its gonna take a hot minute against any decent SL warlock. 
---
i'm surprised you're speaking on pallies/pvp and you're so unfamiliar with a warlock in generals/SL warlocks kit. so much of it counters hpals, and the big part of blowing bubble super early is very easy to do.

You said warriors, (plural, so at least 2) windfury, shaman is 3, then the warlock, so at least 4.  4/10 is pretty close to half.
---
I didn't see anything about a single SL warlock.
---
Never said he wasnt but hes biggest rise in popularity came after that video since Athene did shit with him afterwards
---
"pvP haPpeNinG oN pVp SErvEr".

No one on a PvP server would mind getting ganked once or twice on their way to a dungeon or being outnumbered every now and then out in the open world. The problem is when you're ALWAYS outnumbered and getting to viable content takes longer time than the content itself.

Belt and ring from ogre in arena. Probably high stam necklace from Cath quest. Engineering head. Green dragon scale 3 set. Don’t know if you can do princess quest at that level. There’s a good start at least
---
It is true. And I figured at first you meant the ratio was 3:2 alliance. Also it's not hard to have statistics on how many players populate certain areas, and it does matter. Just because your life revolves around running brm doesnt mean it's the only point of interest.

---
i got muted for spamming "n y s e h o u r l y h o n o u r h a h a h a"
---
it's really just how many people report you
---
Love it when I'm questing and a high level priest buffs me with stamina suddenly I have a ton more health and feel invincible. But get to confident and 90% of the time I die just after the priest rides away...
---
im actually thinking of hitting NE Azshara and farm murlocs etc at the coast there when i hit 50 on all charaters! (currently 49 on 5/8) so we might see each other again soon!
---
oh the addon that mages use for raiding yeah why? /s
---
just because a pally (or any class) can dispel curses doesn't mean shit. for one, can't dispel in fear unless someone else is dispelling them off you. which is fair to assume can/will happen in BGs but that means that person isn't dispelling a warrior knee deep in the shit, or healing them for that matter. dispelling also isn't the cheapest thing ever, i've yet to see a single person stop dispelling when i switched to rank 1 corruption. 
---
shadowbolt is also a thing, and searing pain. felhunter auto attacks. multitudes of different things that aren't going to be dispelled. imagine doing regular curses, getting them dispelled, so baiting dispel with rank 1 and draining mana at the same time. i hope that pally is running 2x mindtap talismans cause have fun going OOM in 15 seconds. 
---
i expect mages to dispel my stuff. does that mean i cant kill mages? far from it. same applies to priests, paladins. you name it.
---
Does anyone have a really good source for theorycrafting vis-a-vis the weapon skill and rating system? 
---
I can never remember if I should go for 8% or 9% hit, for instance. 
---
I think it's 9% miss chance that you can only reduce to 1%? 
---
And that's same for all two handed weapons, including ranged?
---
Love playing on this server, because the realm was added late after launch feels like there aren’t too many try hards.
---
I'm really excited to see the Hrde get sent back to Org in a wheelbarrow like they did in 2005. Alliance organized pvp will dominate bgs and Horde will complain and rage quit just like they did 15 years ago.
---
I miss the old days where people had common sense and just switched to a normal server when they became fed up with being ganked.
---
Same on Ashbringer-EU, alliance basically owns all the neutral cities
---
34min is where we start talking about Specs and builds. 
---
52min is where the Matchups start. And then just skip whatever classes you want to. The trinkets/OH’s and such that are best for each matchup are in each class matchup section.

3hr 1min is where the Consumes, trinkets and OH’s are discussed.

you misread/misunderstood what i said.

" paladins are great but i'd pref windfury with some good warriors + a good warlock to negate pally" is what I said.

paladins are great. however, i would prefer windfury with some good warriors on my team. also, a good warlock to negate the paladin on the other team.
---
i'm not talking about a situation where a pally is getting gangbanged 4v1. i'm speaking in general, a team comp where theres a sham or two for WF, a few good geared warriors, and also at least one good SL warlock to negate at least one of the enemies healing paladins. They don't have to be in the same place, at the same time, fighting the same people. I was simply saying as part of a team comp. The fact that you think any half decent SL warlock would need anyone else to kill you 1v1 is somewhat hilarious actually.
---
Relatable lol.
---
It's really not.
---
There simply wont be enough content. If your endgame goal is pve (according to the sub poll this is a majority)/and you dont care about pvp there is nothing to do after like 4-5 days of played at 60. The only options left are an alt or farming mats like Lotuses for the future.
---
Atm I am just paying a subscription for like a few hours per week and I believe that it will be the same for BWL soon enough.
---
I think the game will lose a lot of players in the BWL patch while we wait for AQ and while some will come back, many wont.
---
Is it their fault Blizzard's itemization was shitty? For prebis, if something makes you do more damage, why not farm it? At least they're not like warlocks who have to scour the AH for green +shadow items
---
Just like to old joke: How many rogues do you need to kill a paladin? Two: One to attack him in the outside world and one waiting for him in IF inn.
---
Yeah but tbh the debuffs can be a shitshow, especially when the imps + adds join the fight, which is the phase that sipoh life makes faceroll. I would just skip it altogether with a lesser invis without it
---
Downvoted for defending horde on a 70:30 A:H server, nice going Classic community.
---
This is true to a certain extent. There comes a break-even where higher raw DPS is more valuable than weapon skill on your OH. That being said, I cannot say if flurry axe or lobotomizer is better for orc OH.
---
this map doesn't work. I went for the full green loop-around but still died 15 times. its just a longer way to walk from the ghost healer so i prefer taking the direct walk of death.
---

---
nice thanks. SM/Ruin vs SL/Nightfall vs SL/Sburn vs Conflag or what? is that part worth watching if I already know the general pvp specs/upsides and downsides? 
---
thanks again
---
Pathfinding 100
---
Why what?
---
So?  It doesn't matter unless you're stacking world buffs and full consumes.  If you're in a guild that does that, they're prioritizing weapons to their tanks accordingly anyway.
---
My experience of phase 1 on a PVP realm was similar to yours. The vast majority of PVP I was involved in was balanced because my opponents were around my level. This felt balanced, fair, what I expected, and much less frustrating when compared to the gank squads that infest every PVP realm now.
---
I think Blizzard made a huge mistake releasing honor without BGs. And I think they'll continue to release content at a faster pace to avoid players getting bored and unsubbing. But releasing honor was the worst because that pushed players to gank lower levels for easy kills - ruining it for anyone who wants to take the game at a slower pace, or has a lot of family commitments.
---
spam rank 1 flash heal
---
Was that guy yelling playing in a sewage tunnel
---
Why do stories like this make ganking so much fun?
---
Yeah, and that orc would be better off tanking with Deathbringer.
---
We've seen a lot of them and have given a few to warriors, both tank and DPS. It should be tank/rogue prio first though.
---
senjin #1
---
Eh...I don't want to be a killjoy but....this doesn't work. I know it doesn't because I tried it and failed. The person who gets summoned gets summoned exactly where you're standing.
---
Classic will die in 2 phase 🤔
---
&gt; Also theres a constant flow of horde rogues into ally main cities while theres near 0 in horde.
---
&gt; &gt; Untrue.
---
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is true. 
---
It is not true. Several rogues were present in Org even before honor was out. There is also an extremely rabid group of players that happen to gank in Org too (Bigdawg is the rogue of the group, I can't recall the rest, often pairs with a druid). There's also another rogue that's been planted in org for days on top of the tower above repair (but I can't remember his name).
---
&gt; Also it's not hard to have statistics on how many players populate certain areas, and it does matter.
---
It heavily fluctuates and addons are currently not able to get accurate statistics (census for example).
---
&gt; Just because your life revolves around running brm doesnt mean it's the only point of interest.
---
Regardless of your opinion, BRM is point of interest, because it offers content from level 50+ all the way to the, currently only, endgame raid. So it doesn't matter what you *think*, that's a fact - it's a point of interest. So is DM, since it offers lots of prebis items and is generally known as a farming spot.
---
One might argue that chapel in EPL is also an interest point, since it's the pathway to Stratholme, but that's significantly less important than aforementioned options.
---
I get that you might act on feelings and assumptions, but if you want to have a civilized discussion, you might want to accept facts.
---
You feel better now? Lol
---
Kinda feel bad for you. Not really tho
---
I always dish out stamina buffs to low levels. Their health nearly doubles sometimes haha.
---
You make yourself look stupid by ignoring the context of the conversation. I was replying to a comment about the use of Felheart in raid content.
---
they sold glad boost, not merciless. and if they did it mustve been on the worst BG in the world, and 1000g is a scam. I took 2500-5000g for gladiator boost on a competetive bg.
---
It's not BiS mitigation tank, it's BiS *threat* tank, which uses a lot of DPS BiS gear.
---
I think we’ll continue to see player base drop off as people have mc farmed but there will
---
Be big spikes with every new phase.
---
A Paladin and a Druid will be hard to beat for flag carrying in Warsong Gulch. If the Alliance team locks/slows down your dispellers you will not be able to stop them really. BoP and 16 second Hand of Freedom + Bear form/Travel Form is just hard to beat.
---
On mograine the market has completely dropped out of this now. Recipes only go for 5g on the ah most days.
---
but mooom when I click pom pyro the healer says IMMUNE  
---
WTF
---
I love incendius, but I will say the horde at Brm are turds. You guys guard brm on Tuesday like helms deep.
---
yes, at the age of 4 doesnt count.
---
But you do know that Classic is an recreation to Vanilla, and yeah here and there are soem changes, like the engine and such, but why do you want to nerf and Number that was critical to the gameplay back then ?
---
For me this is how it was, ad that it should remain like this.
---
Horde players, obviously
---
We had the exact same thing happen to me and a rogue friend of mine last night. Met an alliance warrior with hand of rag and his hunter friend and we became friends and dueled just outside Burning Steppes. This is why I love classic!
---
That happened to me too, stupid bug quest just didn't spawn Tirion on the first try, but I think lets just start it once more. Then next try Taelan dies on the way (I thought he would solo it easily until where he's supposed to die, but he didn't).
---
Then I was going for a new disguise but didn't realize the disguise is lost if you mine ores until I was up at Hearthglen. Run back again. Get a new disguise again. Run up again. Wait for Taelan respawn. Start the quest again, which takes sooo long.
---
All things combined I probably invested 2h in this quest, and that is without the opposing faction intervening (thank god I took the transfer to a medium pop, alliance dominated server)... Getting ganked on this quest sure must be brutal.
---
Your faction on your server.
---
There is a nice writeup here:
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor\_System](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_System)
---
You can also try this tool, i find it pretty useful:
---
 [https://www.wowdownrank.com/](https://www.wowdownrank.com/)
---
Your buff management addon is probably fucking up. Turn it off and you will gauranteed see the proc effect as a 15sec buff.
---
I've heard the issues are because of BFA based servers, so you think Vanilla servers would actually perform better than current Classic ones even with so many more people? I guess if they were made bigger.
---
I think it all hinges on how easy/hard BWL is for the casuals that clear MC in 1.5-3h. If in 2 weeks all guilds have it on easy farm I think the game will blees players like crazy unless AQ comes faat enough or ar least gets announced so people have something too look forward to.
---
It’s sort of like RP. You see a member of the opposite faction and you try your best to inconvenience them as much as possible. It’s fun.
---
Cross-realm doesn’t mean horde vs horde... you have no clue what you are talking about
---
Omfg dude Blatant Disregard
---
It’s Numb the troll mage.  Holy fuck bro
---
Fair enough, thanks for explaining!
---
Okay lets say it takes three hours to lvl to 10. And lets say it takes 10 seconds to walk from AH to mail.
---
Dont know the actual numbers rn, but im juat making an example.
---
With sprint you save 2.5 seconds every time you do that run. 60 divided by 2.5 is 24.
---
24 times 180 is 4320.
---
So after ur 4320th bank alt run, its profit time.
---
Doesnt seem so far of a stretch to me.
---
Took me 45 minutes to get into DM North for a tribute boost. Not an exaggeration at all.
---
Cross-realm, not cross faction
---
Ok noted thx bye
---
\&gt; I really wonder if horde players feel any satisfaction when they kill a  54 level not even genuinely pvp geared (im wearing leathers lol) over  and over before letting him walk even 1 step. How much honor do i give  anyway? 
---
yes
---
can someone explain this for someone who just started?
---
People pay for DM groups?
---
Bloodfang is a very nice server. Mid pop in the evening and very balanced. Because of its medium size you know most guilds and people just like regular Vanilla servers
---
he's old, bruv.
---
i guess.
---
don't think the state of the game for either faction is worth starting fresh though.
---
Well.. some are! There's a certain Alliance Guild at least!
---
Your UI scares me
---
Not if I try it on your first :P
---
He is 49 actually
---
I may do that, but oof thats a lot of swimming.
---
this sub and r/wow is incredibly 90% alliance it feels like, just a reddit thing?
---
Nobody seems to understand sarcasm anymore. Great post OP.
---
the problem is there is no real pvp on some of these realms. 2v1 every fight is not quality pvp. it's not fun for either side because there is no challenge to it.
---
Yeah, for me it is just barely worth it. I think if my guild was not super nice and friendly I would have quit.
---
Wiping them on Galv was a good strat. Recap towers and push.
---
I've once seen 3 of one RTV. Will never see that again for sure :)
---
I have not looked at any logs to confirm, but this sounds very, very unrealistic.
---
The mana refund is 35% of the base cost of the spell.
---
(100/35)\*3000 mana = 8571 mana would be the 100% number to compare 35% to, BUT the mana refund has 25% chance to proc, meaning you'd have to do (8571\*4) = 34286\~mana spent to get that type of refund, (3000/34286)\*100 = \~8.75% mana refunded, which is pretty much in line with how much mana per cast this set bonus should save you. In case the refund is based off the base cost (as the set bonus wording implies), then the -5% mana cost talent might perhaps be factored in to the mana spent - but even so, you'd have to spend 32571 mana during the fight to reach that \~3k mana refund from this set, provided my assumptions hold true.
---
Death! Death awaits you there young druid.
---
Going through Burning Steppes is much safer.
---
You can jump in the lava and if you're lucky enough make it to the platform.
---
SM/Ruin is bf spec. Along with SL
---
after a bg everyone is teleported to the battlemaster.
---
I got your sarcasm and found it great.
---
How familiar are you with MC? Are you gonna be leading that raid team? I'm stoked for you man, I had to step in and main tank the other night for our team since it was Thanksgiving week and we had some people out and I was tight butthole the entire night. Everything went well but I sure as hell wasn't used to that kind of pressure I put on myself. Given a few more runs through I feel like I'd get a hang of it. Curious how you're handling it.
---
Happened to me  in cata. Sold a 20k belt for 20 gold. That hurt.
---
We got Night Elf Mages so the lore is just fucked in that regard.
---
Any information about battlegrounds weekends yet?
---
I do this: unequip gear when entering boat, when they gank you, it doesnt matter - you can just release and spirit rezz at the destination. Usually thats even quicker than just taking the boat and walking to the flight master. Also, since you are travelling to another destination anyway, Rezz sicknezz will be gone by then!
---
This is about 90% unrelated, but I played both Star Trek Online and Neverwinter pretty religiously (after "quitting" wow) and they had to remove their custom quest creators at the exact same time a couple months after the dude who was maintaining both left the company and they didn't know how to fix them.
---
No bearing on this comment, it was just... really odd. And a bit fucked.
---
Nobody know.  
---
No one predicted how popular Classic will be, so you are asking for some kind of "divine relevation". Just wait and see.  
---
It definitely won't die, and if you check popular servers they are blooming with life.  
---
I re-roled on high-pop server and already make a fortune by selling things that I could never sell on old server, like Small eggs or Light Leather.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Forsaken and Orcs make up more than 50% of active characters all pvp servers combined. Surely this is because of looks and nothing to do with the balance of racials ?
---
I'm not calling for nerfs, but they are op compared to a lot of others.
---
When and if it jumps you'll have higher chance of getting a proc than if purely single target, yes. Think I've seen lower numbers that. That 58, but may be accurate.
---
Stop qq'ing, bitch
---
Thank you, I will do so because these two things I do not understand:
---
&gt; Perd blade and cth is a solid setup but it causes weird itemization  later where drops start barely increase dang and swords start overtaking 
---
In MC the daggers are better than the available swords. In BWL CTS is superior to PB but not by that much. In AQ the daggers are clearly better than the swords. In Naxxramas they are relatively even. 
---
The gear sword and dagger rogues wear is pretty much the same with a few exceptions like Aged Core Leather Gloves etc.
---
While Backstab costs 50 % more energy than SS it also does 150 % weapon damage and causes additional 210 (later 225 damage) and has 30 % additional critical strike chance. SS is a basic strike with additional 68 damage. However, the lower energy costs of SS allow for more Eviscerates while a dagger rogue is barely able to use Eviscerate.  
---
The offhand of dagger rogues is usually faster resulting in more poison proccs or more sharpening stone damage (assuming WF is on the main hand).
---
I am really interested in what causes this slow damage increase for dagger rogues. Obviously, there must be something I am missing/not considering.
---
&gt; I’m not saying daggers sucks or you should go daggers. But if your  pushing for speed runs swords ends up doing quite a bit more damage. 
---
For me those are two different things. The spreadsheet simulates a patchwork fight against a single boss while speed runs really depend on trash. And during trash fights a dagger rogue depends more on the tanks ability to position the mobs to allow for bf + backstab but that's something the spreadsheet cannot simulate.
---
I am really curious to see the math behind.
---
&gt; In the mean time tank whenever needed in raids and tank 5 mans for guildies. If you are sitting in preraid BIS there isn’t a dungeon boss you can’t tank as Fury or Arms. Be vocal that you want to tank but don’t nag or complain about it. Your MT could burn out or get poached by another guild.
---
Amen to this. Prepare for the position like you would if you were trying to prepare yourself to take a promotion at your job. There may not be a position open for you to be promoted to right now, but prepare yourself as if there was. One day an opportunity will open itself to you, and if you're prepared then you can take it.
---
It's a lot funnier when they yell it at a boomkin
---
I'm surprised that people like dual-wielding that much, when you miss with every auto attack &gt;:
---
&gt; Yes, the game is 15 years old. Yes every nook and cranny is known. But we can still not expect everyone to be fully informed. 
---
Why did you go straight to the worst kind of strawman argument? I can't tell if you want a real conversation or are just ranting aimlessly because you got kicked from a group.
---
This is exactly right. I don't mind helping people or answering questions but it's a totally different thing when someone what's the best gear and to level quickly but makes literally no effort to learn anything on their own.
---
Why would you need it for roleplay?
---
Honor System came out a month before BG back in vanilla too. #nochanges
---
Pretty sure you can, it just scales down
---
interesting, never encountered a warrior who saw me first, then again i have full stealth talents
---
I saw something like this in one of the general addons like 
---
LeatrixPlus.
---
Nope no info.
---
Its not hard, thats not the point. But there are people that either dont know those guides exist and as such dont look them up, or rather dont want to look them up because they want their own experience, not one provided by a guide.
---
Why are we ousting these people?
---
yeah i got the shoulders ;P
---
True, the conversation i guess was the context. I’m too used to seeing other warlocks trash the gear with no context and make themselves look stupid in the process, my apologies
---
another way to do it is to do as you said......zone in for the boss.....but start the boss fight with your alt twink....let them get killed.....then you dont get XP for the kill, but do still have access to the loot from the boss. Means you have less XP to worry about.
---
they are one of the less played classes but iirc most raids are gonna have at least 4-5 for raid to banish garr adds, so you’re not far off from the norm. warlocks are one of the less  popular classes but that mostly means it may be easier to find a raid spot. i’d say stick it out, everyone gets geared eventually—just be happy you’re not a mage rolling against 8-10 other people every raid haha
---
From engineering.
---
Go pveservers then lul
---
I’m playing on Earthshaker. The server is healthy with regards to the player base and AH. It can at times be a pain to travel to dungeons, especially Straholme, BRD and BRS due to horde pvp teams. It is usually not a major problem if the group travels together. Certain High lvl zones close are at the moment full of pvping to the point where I avoid em unless beeing in a team. Farming in places like Un’Goro, Azahara and Silithus is still possible with the occasional pvping. I would guess that there will be less world pvping once the bgs opens.
---
seriously if you need a guide for lock you got bigger problems.
---
You haven't missed anything man. Opportunities will come up. Attend raids with your warrior, spec fury for now, be a good DPS, and collect tank gear. Be the first to volunteer to help pick up offtank duties in encounters like majordomo, and be good at it. Just be ready to take a tank spot when your guild loses a tank or forms a second raid team. People fall off and quit and get bored over time. Positions will open.
---
Currently playing a (23) mage. Would I have a lot of trouble on a Warrior as a new player? I miss an all-in playstyle such as that of a warrior. My friend 10 levels below me crits as much as I do!
---
What are some ways of reaching opponents? I did some research and discovered that engineering is great for closing the gap e.g.; grenades/rocket boots. 
---
How do warriors play in BGs? Do they make as good flag carriers as mages?
---
There's nothing hard or complex that require extensive video.  
---
Run dungeon once with competent tank and you will know it.  
---
Only complex dungeon right now is Scholomance, but again - common knowledge about LoS pulling is enough to finish it without much hassle.
---
It helps generate a ton of threat and the loss in armor is largely negligible when you only have 1~2 chain pieces.
---
I wasnt. I know the game inside out. I just dont like the treatment of people who dont.
---
This have been argued a lot among lore people and this post explains it well:  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/dvfbad/there\_seem\_to\_be\_a\_lot\_of\_misconceptions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/dvfbad/there_seem_to_be_a_lot_of_misconceptions/)  
---
TLDR: During WC3 and the battle of Hyjal NE is slaughtered and have grown stagnant with being the top dog so long. They havent evolved and are now few in numbers. When you create a night elf in WoW it even says "One of the few left". They need allies.
---
Fuck move into the cul-death-sack out of the main pass, pop an invis or stealth, and you're probably fine. 
---
What do you expect?
---
"Ayy mate I wen up to this crackhead and told him how pathetic he was for being homeless an tol him if he jus get a job he can have these mass stacks. Idk why he punched me in the faceb n took me wallet. Fuckin homeless ye?"
---
How yall doin today
---
Because we share a loot table. You’re expected to carry your weight and be knowledgeable on the gear you’re taking from that loot table. Wow isn’t a single player rpg. There are plenty or casual guilds that gladly will slow roll with you but when you’re grouping with random people don’t expect them to cater to you.
---
If you wish for something, it does not make it true :D
---
Man the bubble hearth to deny a gank is great. I do it alot when I need to hand in something in EPL. Fuck the horde I ain't giving up my honour juice so easy.
---
Wasn't chromatic drake mount actually in vanilla game files?
---
Damn that's my realm !! But I'm horde side anyway
---
Have you all tried reinstalling the game? Maybe check your drivers
---
warrior is just salty, id take the chest as hunter if it dropped
---
its better than t1 unless you get 8set which can take several months and if youre unlucky, never.
---
The spec not listed here that is actually better than 'BiS' hunter is spelldamage hunter, it surpases 'regular' hunter gear/spec at P4 once you can get more SP gear from ZG.
---
People meme and joke, but they are making themselves look like fools because it is really the best hunter spec, it's so taboo to even try to do this that people still think it's a joke.
---
We'll see when the people who know whatsup start topping charts and all of a sudden SP gear is considered mainspec hunter gear, the caster tears will be funny.
---
The shitty thing is, if it's better, THAT IS THE MAINSPEC. We basically become spellhunters, trading off our physical for magical damage. Anyone who refuses to allow a hunter gear this way is not allowing them to reach their full potential.
---
Can't wait for P4 to see this start happening. My guild is supporting me in it, and it's way better for PVP.
---
Ofcourse it has to do with Racials !  
---
one race has better racials for PVP and another for PVE thats was how it worked,  
---
 They tweaked it in some ways in later expansions tho.....
---
So just stick around a bit longer, or coem back when the re-release those expansions, but then is when you are going to get it, and not earlier  
---
Why would you change their cycle by changing things earlier then they did it them selves.  
---
Did you know a mayority asked for Vanilla, so i see no reasong why they should change this anytime sooner.
---
Exactly, streamer that no-lifed the game and ran out of content in a week. It’s a shame really, especially for casual players or players with a family and jobs who can’t play 7+ hours a day.

Devout has 0 healing it's dogshit. You're wasting other people's time in MC wearing that.
---
Well, the chance of not getting a proc with 3 hits is 0.75 ^ 3 or 3^3 / 4^3 = 27 / 64. That comes to 42.2%, so the chance to get at least one proc with 3 hits is the reverse, i.e. 57.8%.
---
Shouldn't it always jump in a raid/dungeon enviroment?
---
Speaking from my memory from 14 years ago:
---
No it wont get better, on a PVP servers.  
---
This game was know for it.  
---
Any run to a Dungeon, enjoy 3 corpseruns atleast to get there.  
---
This was how it was back in the days, and probabbly how it will be today, but lets wait and see how BG's turns out
---
bruh I got Vengeful too, rank 2 of battlegroup for a while... close yet so far XD
---
&gt; What am I supposed to be doing, exactly, as a Feral Druid? 
---
Respec to heal. Main strength of druid is versatility. 
---
Feral is just inferior rogue and you will always loose in direct 1-on-1 fights.  
---
To win you need to use your whole toolkit - heals, ranged attacks, kiting. Just man-fighting and exchanging hits will end in you loosing fight.  
---
And feral is just not fit for this. You need to be in hybrid PvP spec to win in PvP.
---
Bennie is pissed rn.
---
lol oh
---
Sweet mate. Yeah I thought I'd mention it incase you didn't know! Glad it paid off. You can get rank 3 by next weds if that's all you do. Otherwise you'll comfortably get rank 2 probably :)
---
Just dodge that too.
---
Been doing MC for 2 months. First time they dropped was last week.
---
#justboomerthings
---
Wrath Balance Druid. Balance druids exclusively stack +arcane damage. I would love to try stacking +nature damage and just being a wrath machine gun.
---
Someone who's dodging guides because they want *their own experience* is probably in no position to make this judgement call.
---
Is this similar for hunters? Apart from the glancing blows, obviously. 
---
That would make Trueaim gloves better than T1.
---
Then they are not using the Engineering Goggles.  
---
Theres a video out there how big the range is.
---
Full raid buffs, full uptime on armor debuffs, full greasing with all consumables, and perfect rotation with correct deathwish timing. Does not include recklessness.
---
Go ahead and change bubble to be 4s duration while you're at it.
---
Im just gonna provide you with a personal story:
---
A former guildmate of me joined a PVP server because he wanted to see what World PVP was all about. He had only heard stories but had only started playing with MoP. 
---
Of course he started getting pissed off that the stories were fake and that World PVP was shit, he got rolled constantly and got nothing done.
---
When I asked him why he didnt roll PVE he said:
---
"I thought PVE servers meant there was no PVE outside of BGs."
---
And I understood. It actually doesnt tell you anywhere ingame that you can flag yourself for PVP on PVE servers. You cant know unless somebody told you or you read it somewhere online. 
---
I bet his story isnt unique. And now he is stuck on a PVP server, or rather, has quit.
---
we see post like this every day
---
Mind-boggling? Yes... It's quite the conundrum.
---
Its simpel mate, you are the opposite faction on a pvp server. You are walking honor, get gud, get wrecked or move to PVE if you figure out openworld forced pvp isn't your thing.
---
I know about the invasion, but all googling about it came back with no real results how many of those mobs there will be and how will they affect the prices, and everything I did find made it seem like there wont be that many.
---
As for that other transmute it is pretty bad. It is press button to lose money :)
---
never saw viskag either.
---
a friend of me got a dudu main and a warrior fury tank alt.
---
he just pugged ony and mc this week. and won brutality blade and viskag first try.
---
my rogue main is dying inside
---
If I remember right  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005320105041-3-500243010330121](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005320105041-3-500243010330121)  was my favorite one.  If you were interested in tailoring the build more to fighting other rogues and are willing to give up some ability to ambush without Cold Blood, you can take 2 points from imp ambush and put them in Heightened Senses.  For me the combo of prep and cold blood was just too much fun and I never got super geared.
---
It's different in naxx though.
---
Slow weapons will fall behind a bit in execute phase. But slower mainhand will give you better cleave. I think DB + BB is your current best in most situations.
---
 I've been playing WoW for 15 years and have never heard of these islands... What a shame !
---
It's part of their pre-bis.
---
Nah, a giant parrot!
---
There are way more PvP servers than PvE servers though.
---
Meh 9 out of 10 times you find rankers stealthing on the path south of kargath and in the choke between the 2 zones . 
---
If you are unlucky to get killed just inside searing you are brought to thorium GY and have to corspe run around the entire cauldron pit .
---
Also in my personal experience brm domination has been split between factions , I don't have a sense of security when i get there . 
---
Wouldn't say alliance suffers world pvp imbalance like other servers claim
---
He was running cause he was out of mana.
---
Dude.... The amount of times I CC two or three random Alli while 3 horde try to kill one preist and the preist ends up killing everyone then me is dumb. I don't get it. 
---
I understand randoms will not coordinate well (not nearly as good as a group) but you'd hope when someone makes a fight 2v1 or better that they could at least kill someone. 
---
Today I seriously pollied a preist, froze/naded a rogue, and GMC a warrior. 3 horde failed to kill a single Alli preist. It was the saddest fucking showing I've seen yet. 
---
I ran beind a fight that broke out yesterday and pollied/cc spamed the preist, CSed the pally (at quarter health), and naded the rogue out of a stealth. This leaft a single rogue in a 4v1 vs a fucking shaman (with hand of rag) and somehow I got saped by this very rogue and everyone got wiped. I even had a R1 fireball on this rogue!
---
It's mad tilting. I accept that these are the confirmation bias few, but fuck if it doesn't still tilt me.
---
There was and addon that counted laps around dalaran. If they haven't made major changes to the api in later  expansions it should be doable.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/South_Seas_islands
---
Or just Silverpine Forest and Sons of Arugal... fuck those
---
Thanks, this saved us the replies from every single horde player.
---
Like the honor system itself? Getting an advantage by steamrolling through 48 lvl zones, hindering players from playing the game is "fair".
---
I have 0 problems with wpvp and had fun before lvl48, even after the release of p2. But the shit thats going on right now is ridicolous. Im lvling in ZF right now and when i try to go to gadgetzan to repair im getting killed atleast 3 times because some mage sits in the middle, gets only attacked by one guard and blinks out when im down. Last friday i went to felwood at 3:30 when i got stunlocked by a camping 60 undead rogue... there are around 3 groups of 5+ lvl60 horde roaming around blasted lands, so i cant even finish a mob. Searing gorge is like an absolute no-go zone and landing at the fp there is like landing in a lava pit, burning steppes i cant even enter from redridge mountains because there is a group camping the entrance.
---
Enemy players can just use single target abilities and avoid this problem completely, its not that they need 100% of their possible dps in 1 lvl 48 vs 10 geared lvl60.
---
&gt;You’re expected to carry your weight and be knowledgeable on the gear you’re taking from that loot table.
---
No you aren't. It's a fucking MMO, everyone pays their own sub. You do not have the ability to expect anything from them.
---
This is insane levels of elitism. Borderline insane bud.
---
tHiS IS Unav0idablE.
---
Nope
---
I love when people below E5 say carry on, as if they have any position to say something
---
Because it can give you the push you need to do cthun,or gluth pre decimate, or sapphiron 4hm or Kel thuzad.
---
Not everything is about faceroll mechanicless MC which will be a distant memory.
---
If you look at the T1 pieces individually, most of them (not all) are not that good. The only reason to stick with a set are the set bonuses. In the case of the [Arcanist Regalia](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=201/arcanist-regalia), only the 3/8 set bonus is relevant.
---
I'm not entirely sure how to calculate the equivalency, but both %crit and %hit can be expressed in spell damage. You should look into that.
---
Also, if you wish to share a set on sixtyupgrades, you'll have to create a sharable link.
---
Done the warrior level numerous times and a 2h is definitely easier. If you're above the curve in an instance you'll probably wreck as dual wield but otherwise 2h is likely way easier and less gear reliant.
---
AV is such a joke in retail... Two factions crossing each other and not even engaging, to be the first on the last boss once towers have been taken and destroyed...
---
I remember a 14 hour session of the first version of AV, I had to quit to go sleeping and clearly recognized my fellow players when I logged back tje day after...
---
That's not your role as a lock, your role is on demand spelldamage.  Landing soul fire immo conflag on ms target in AB or ms target in mid in WSG or EFC during a rogue stun is how you play BG warlock.
---
Are you trying to convince me or yourself? As it isn't really working on me, so figure it must be yourself that you are trying to convince xD
---
Need a hug dude? You seem to be dealing with something
---
you can deathknight like tank mc bosses with that. i would try to make it work at least
---
I personally enjoy a good old 21-8-22 -  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305020005051-3203-4502430300001](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/305020005051-3203-4502430300001) 
---
You can play around with the Sub branch (lose Initiative to get improved Sap for instance), really fun and bursty.
---
fucking weebs
---
Yeah and you are welcome to do whatever you want alone. When you are in a group you are playing with others and you should all respect eachothers time.
---
Same. Y'all need Waze
---
I mean you're not wrong, but I was shocked at how little I remembered (and actively misremembered) about classic - despite playing an honestly depressing amount of vanilla back in the day. 
---
If I was streaming people would have laughed at me/been shocked by my lack of knowledge many many times, and I knew everything back in the day.
---
Any addon to swap sets of gear?
---
ie when Im healing click a button and put on my INT gear?
---
press f13
---
didn't any of you expect this when rolling on a pvp server?
---
Morgan's Vigil is easy picking a for Horde because there's no guards at all. They can literally sit at the flight master and lock it down. It also gets less traffic than Thorium Point so there's little chance of a coordinated response.
---
&gt;  But considering as a hunter you can enchant your weapon with 3% hit 
---
I wish. The recipe hasn't dropped on our server yet.
---
Horde side? As allies is 20g every day
---
Shamans ofc. but just stay enhance.
---
He chose not to inform himself properly.
---
gl, I don't think the twink bracket will be all that big
---
I was lucky enough to get this the week I hit 60. At about 580 Hp5 right now as a warrior.
---
Lvl 300 Night elf Skinner got bored and took his newly acquired Finkles Skinner to dabble at something else
---
LOL I swear to God with Druids I time my deathcoil to the last possible moment.
---
What a boomer thing to say
---
It's still the best threat weapon. In theory you'd get more dps if tank can hold threat with two daggers, but literally nobody does that.
---
I'm not complaining! I understand what the alliance players go through. Just yearning for BGs.
---
The logical thing is that they’ll rotate just AV/WSG until AB is released, no other way makes more sense but I guess we’ll see
---
Flasking in MC lul
---
Me and 90% of my guildies were horde too during vanilla.
---
Thanks for providing the calculations, makes sense!
---
People are not always stacked enough for CH, and it seems this has shorter jump range than that. If garr adds are tanked together (and Domo /sulfuron harbinger) this bonus can get to shine, but will compete with CH shamans.
---
Shaman T2 will definitely put up competition though, as it adds 30% healing to CH - but without a similar Mana refund mechanic.
---
Itemrack has this :)
---
Javel is a girl :P
---
I missed the PvP action back in vanilla because my friends were on a PvE server.
---
This time I wouldn't miss it though, and although I am getting gangbanged constantly by  certain Alliance  groups in a Horde-dominated server, I enjoy every moment of it.
---
If you feel that PvP that is not commenced by you is unwanted, roll in a PvE server and control when you want to PvP.
---
Whoa there slugger - trigger alert!
---
Everyone in the thread please take it easy on the above guy as he gets a bit sensitive when he gets made fun of online.
---
Poor guy needs to know that even if he does cry we still think he's a cool guy. Isn't that right champ?
---
It is speculated that classic has inflated droprates on legendaries. There's far too many hands of rag around, though this one is hard to assess since killing rag back in the day was kind of a big deal, while everyone could do garr/geddon.
---
SL/SL is a TBC spec, this is a discussion about Classic Warlock PvP.  
---
Again picking a spec that is so overpowered that it's banned in most duel tournaments is not how you're going to learn proper mechanics in Classic PvP as a Warlock. We have little to no mobility, and just standing there face tanking someone's major cool downs will not teach you how to play.  
---
Of course the spec is fine if you already understand the basics of each match up, it's just very boring because it's so easy.
---
Not everybody has time to raid and won't play this game beyond a weekly PUG and battlegrounds.
---
Is this where we start talking how these people should just stay in greens or not play the game at all?
---
So far my luck has been OK, venomstrike dropped on 6th run, legging of the fang on 8th run, cruel barb on 12th run, so the Exp soaking is not that bad with my twink gaining the boss Exp. I find it too much trouble having to run my alt to the dungeon everytime just to avoid the boss Exp.
---
Imagine having 1337 players in your faction pool. ;(
---

---
A joy to watch this joy!
---
Hahaha. Another way to grief is to dispel/purge the disguise off while somebody is in the castle. Works great if the opposing faction are trying to get the quest at the same time as you.
---
Shoutout to the braindead rogues attacking the bubble! Your average hord player
---
No different than ally at LHC. I've yet to land and live since P2 lol
---
Any person who has been outside of brm for the last couple of weeks knows the situation is very horde favored. Arguing brm is a point of interest outside of people leveling is honestly not an arguement when you consider that the only time people visit it is in 40 man groups ready to raid. Mining nodes/water essence/elemental fire/felcloth and including major cities like winter spring gadgetzan are all horde favored, making it very difficult for any alliance player to honestly do anything outside of dungeons. So complaining that you as a horde player cant get into brm because alliance is camping the "choke point" when theres a free entrance if you move through burning steppes is a completely null point. None of these are assumptions, it doesnt take an addon to search /who and see the numbers of players in each zone if you have a horde character. And considering level 50+ points of interest, outside of brm, most quests for bis/prebis items occur in wpl epl. You need to recognize the difference between a small alliance party sitting in dm for an hour and a horde zerg that constantly washes over any point the alliance tries to contest outside of brm.
---
Spot on man. I’ve played only on pvp servers since the beginning of vanilla. This isn’t pvp, it’s harassment. There are no space spaces on some of the big servers, not even IF is safe. 
---
I can count the amount of fair 1v1 fights I’ve had since phase 2 started on 1 fucking hand. Either there’s an entire raid of horde people farming every single flight path/instance so you can’t get a fair fight, or there’s a counter group of alliance running around trying to get payback on the gankers.
---
Which was exactly my point.
---
I had experienced this before in my old pc.
---
Addons and bis-lists are part of the reason for those lootdrama shitshows, if players just rely on some addon or some bad misinformative online guides for their prebis instead of using common sense or simply communicating with their party.
---
In P1 the "bis" trinkets for alliance hunters that were listed in every guide were blackhands &amp; HoJ. Yes, you've read that right, HoJ! Because there was no other viable trinket for alliance hunters in p1 that increase dmg and HoJ still atleast gives 20 AP even without its other effect.
---
Imagine the shitstorm from some unknowing hunter only relying on those online guides or his bis-addon and winning HoJ against rogues/wars, because everyone just expects everyone else to inform himself instead of talking to each other ingame.
---
I do videos on Enh Tanking with proper gear/talents @ www.youtube.com/mcdoubles if you want to see it in action!
---
For the whole of phase 1 there were no other melee trinket options that added DPS other than blackhand breadth. So the 20AP on HOJ made it bis until DM. 
---
Personally, and most hunters, just went 'fuck it ill wear arena master or ward of elements etc til DM' rather than all that effort to farm out 20 more AP and deal with rolling v melee who might use it till naxx. But some surely just followed their guides to the letter, didn't engage their brain, and tried to get it.
---
Actually alliance on Kirtonos, one of the worst ratios of all the servers.
---
Reputation definitely matters. On my server theres a guildmasters discord with the leaders from most of the raiding guilds. If someone does something egregiously toxic it gets posted there so its an easy way to get blacklisted from a majority of guilds pretty quickly.
---
Both weapons get the same hit penalty on white swings.
---
I currently have full pre raid bis except wraps still using trash and mirah's - is it worth for me to drop 400ish gold on Kroll blade until raid sword drops? I'm 6 weeks into raiding and still have nothing
---
DM entrance and pre-dungeon is a deathtrap on my serv too. Well most Feralas actually, I usually get killed instantly at the exit of camp Mojache.
---
I had a similar experience with the quest except I unbound shift-v to use it for something else so I ended up finishing it in hardcore mode.  I was fully expecting to fail it, but it ended up going pretty smooth actually.
---
Maybe it's different from class to class, but for Feral Tanking I find conflicting information left and right. You definitely have to do a LOT of research.
---
Might be because it's a weird niche though.
---
this always happened on private servers when I disconnected and was flying on a gryph somewhere. When i logged back this happened.
---
Damn, can we think of any other times in society when someone important / powerful hasn't been held accountable for stuff where normal people would be punished? :-)
---
As someone with exam today, they’re today.
---
- Alliance have a better defendable base. Also they can jump across the wall into horde base.
---
- Horde can take "back door" to get into Alliance base, if skilled enough jumpers.
---
#A WHOLE NEW WORLD 🎶
---
... which matters for the 8% of guilds that do enough DPS to push the ceiling.
---
All these warriors who use "gearing for threat" as an excuse to tank everything in full DPS gear leather/mail w/o a shield are getting kind of tiresome by now.
---
He's also missing arena grandmaster and his weapons should be enchanted with crusader, not fiery. 
---
Fiery is great for some extra bursts against ungeared low levels, but not as good as crusader against equally geared lvl 19 twinks with 1 - 1.5k hp when each proc heals you for \~10% of your health and doubles your AP.
---
The plate and shield is such a big deal. It's hardly worth trying to kill a geared holy paladin as warrior/hunter/rogue/feral. Sure you can do it, but not quickly - and certainly not quick enough to change a teamfight.
---
How about a Parrot mount for DM/VC, 
---
 Stocks you could just be rewarded with a horse of some kind as thank for quelling the riot. 
---
For SM how about riding on the one boss while he does his whirlwind axe thing LoL.
---
 Ulda you could have the Lost Viking Carry you around or summon their floating boat like in HotS.
---
BFD a Naga mount would be Kool, or a Crab or Nessy
---
Mara you could get a Croc.
---
ST would probably be a drake of some fassion.
---
BRD could just be a Lava flow.
---
Strat a ghost/phantom/skeleton horse, maybe a plagued one.
---
Scholo Gargoyle mount.
---
so we can just stay in our city? i thought when we win or stop a bg, it let's us out in a weird place

---
Hey mages.
---
I'm in the process of leveling my alliance mage alt atm, and as much fun as it is doing wPvP while leveling I'm also interested in reaching level 60 on it. Since level 44 I've been solo farming ZF graves and I plan on doing this until it doesn't give experience anymore because omfg the gold and xp/hour at these levels is insane. 
---
However, my question is: Is it possible to do solo instance farming all the way to level 60 from my current level of 47?
---
My plan is to do solo DM east lasher (and possibly satyrs too) farming as soon as I can and stay there until I'm level 60, but where do I go between ZF and DM east? Maraudon? BRD?
---
If you have any tips on where to go and which mobs to farm I would really appreciate it a lot! Also, does anyone know at what level I can start farming DM east? I mean, the lashers are probably somewhat easy to kill once they are yellow to me, but I'm a bit concerned about being a low level running around and pulling aggro on the patrols and the big flowers whose name I forgot.
---
Any tips are appreciated, thanks a lot.
---
Yeah and now take away crafted gear and look at all the healing gear available before lvl 50.
---
It's dirt easy to get shadow dmg gear, but there is no healing gear almost. Given the fact that early on int almost always outclasses +healing there is no reason to stack +heal while lvling a healer.
---
Don't get me wrong, i had around 300 +heal pretty fast, 160 is low. But I see how it happens and it's not a real problem anyways.
---
This is not vanilla. This is classic 15 years later. Using a very simple tool that tells you what gear is optimal is not some peak elitism.
---
what a Generation X/millennial/Generation Z thing to say
---
IIRC you can queue up in a city, then fly/hearth/teleport elsewhere while the queue is going, accept when it pops and after the BG is over you appear near the battlemaster in town again.
---
You won't get +21 damage anyway.  
---
Spells have a coefficients, and at low levels they are quite low.  
---
For example if you somehow get +100 spell damage on level 1 char - damage would be increased by ~10 max.
---
I think assassin's Blade &amp; something else in OH. Can't remember, but they're definitely not the best twink sword for sure.
---
Sure, enjoy the kick and go whine about elitism when you dont do the bare minimum.
---
This game is so laughably easy you have to be truly horrendous to get people upset.
---
Sounds like all you need to know about warrior leveling.
---
&gt;Muh honorable 1v1 fights
---
Im not expecting anything genius, i mearly stated that the concept of wow's "open world pvp" is a broke. Barely thought out idea that is atm based on ganking. Corpse camping or group zerging of randoms and lower levels. All you need is numbers and low lvls to gank. Nothing skilled anout it. Specially with all plebs going one faction because of pre-gathered/datamined knowledge of the game and it's balance. World pvp was fixed in BFA with the option of toggling it on and only fighting likeminded people. Wow classic's "open world pvp" is 100x worse than vanilla was BECAUSE of the pre-existing experience/knowledge available
---
Necropile in Scholo is a great starter set,
---
speaking from a SPriest perspective. We pretty much stack spellpower and stam aswell.
---
Is it actually viable if you tryhard HS toggle?
---
He's living in a fantasy world where his lock will simultaneously melt a paladin while tanking multiple melee. Meanwhile the reality is warlocks in BGs get locked down by melee and hunters eat them alive. I wouldn't bother indulging his fictions.
---
Blizzard has been iiffy about banning for offences that have player oriented solutions. A 60 level ganker can just be counter ganked by you or some other member of your faction.
---
that's awesome!
---
Never had any people rejecting someone in 5-man dungeons.  
---
And as a resto druid I will welcome spriest any time. It's good to have someone with normal resurrect in party :)
---
It will be but just for twinks lol
---
im playing 60:40 horde side shazzrah and it takes forever to find any alliance and when you find one 40 horde zug zergs charge in and you get 1 honor each, how is that "not noticeable", having 2/3 horde raids camping 1 alliance is pretty common on this shit server lol
---
Alliance! Play a gnome for a god tier PvP racial!
---
Yes you have to tag the boss, evade him and once you are out of combat the door towards the prison area opens up. Just keep in mind that once the boss resets he will still do his round so you have to be careful not to re-aggro him while running out.
---
Wow, that's ridiculous. Taking it from proper melee who would use it ill Naxx for a measily 20 AP...
---
I mean, if everyone greeded and the hunter got it I wouldn't have a problem. I really hope I won't end up in a group like that when I start farming for it...
---
Well, warlocks tend to be a lot more chill as well.
---
what's the difference between 9% hit at 300 skill and 6% hit at 305?
---
Healing the current raids is so boring.
---
Giving me dubgeons where shit hits the fan all the time. That's when it gets fun.
---
&gt;Imagine one of your healers is being camped by an undead rogue. 
---
Obviously the rogue is the pussy here. Sure he mightve won the fight fair and square but not allowing that 1 foe to get back up just shows the lack of skill. If he can easy kill the priest he should be able to do so again at full health/mana. But allas people cant get past easy kills because those people rarely want to better themselves.
---
I'd fuck him up and help rhe priest just becaude of how low the rogur is. Which atm is showing what toxic shit this pvp system turns it into
---
&gt;Put some effort once in your life if you wanna progress in something
---
What a great reply to a question about an MMO-RPG. I don't like excessive hand-holding in this game more than your average joe, but do you hear how that sentence of yours sounds?
---
Stop saying Bloodfang is nice an balanced. 
---
Stop talking about how camping only last 30 Mon 'cause the other faction usually gets there and wipes them. 
---
Or that the economy works and prices are not very stupid ( well, black lotus are, but that's on every server).
---
Or that you still find a lot of more casual people leveling and it's lovely.
---
Talk about how there's a dumb ally hunter who always tries to camp between kargath and SG, ir sometimes people do corpse runs on BRM, or every bad thing Bloodfang may have. 
---
Because is the server I'm in and I don't want the risk of a massive exodus fucking up the nice balance we have.
---
The 'you need too much time to be in a serious raiding guild!'  is a total meme, if you are in a good guild you spend LESS time raiding.
---
Sure, people make bad decisions all the time because they don't have the information. But this is not a problem with the game. If you're willing to commit 5-10 DAYS of playtime to a game (just to get to 60), then why wouldn't you do 10 minutes of research to find out what it's all about?
---
I did this and just got the eye of Sulfuras!!! Thanks roondragoon!
---
Same for my server, if you're horde you can fly to Thorium and run straight down and only run into 1 or 2 alliance before you get to the mountain, on the other hand there is ALWAYS a full raid group of alliance sitting in the mountain pass waiting for people trying to get through from Kargath.
---
I had the same issue. Must have spent at least 4 hours just to try to initiate the quest. Got killed during the quest 3 or so times. In the end I had a few friends help me by killing anyone that tired to interrupt me and I still managed to die, but luckily, if you die near the tower, you can still witness the event, run back and ress after Tirion has gone to town on the crusade. He will stay there, waiting for you to turn in the quest for a while. As long as you're there for the tower event, you can even turn the quest in after someone else has done it, as Tirion from the event is shared.
---
Yeah, but that effort is like ten seconds. Classic is insanely easy and you need to take like thirty seconds to get informed on any topic really. The most difficult part of the endgame pve content for me was setting up my grid2 addon and I just did that because I wanted to, I could easily raid with blizz frames.
---
What a wild ride Reddit must be taking every comment at face value.

Ours is the coolest dude who will always answer when someone asks for help. We make sure to give him some bits and bites to keep him happy (gave him the first Quick Strike Ring that dropped for example), and he will definitely get the eye once it drops.

Lower top end damage, 0 vs 13 stam and an useless proc instead of 62 AP. Arcanite reaper is clearly superior to Demonshear, but as you say, with AV around the corner, there's no reason at all to craft it. However, if you were dead set on ranking and didn't have a rag wep yet when phase 2 rolled around, if you had the extra gold, Arcanite reaper was definitely a weapon worth considering.
---
Maybe he forgot how old he is.
---
If you want to play with the type of players who consider BIS lists important, you have to consider BIS lists important. If you don't want to do that, I'm sure you can find plenty of people who do not really care about BIS lists.
---
Wahey rare to see my server on here, Terrys been there a couple of weeks bugged into the fountain it seems
---
Assuming it works and Blizzard does nothing to change it, yes - at least I will.
---
SGC is better than tier 1 chest for hunters...
---
Yesterday I was killed at the feralas flightpath in camp mojache. So I ressed and blinked into the inn where I was instantly killed by a rogue. So I ressed on the other side of the wall and blinked towards the path to dire maul, where I was killed by another rogue while trying to mount away from there.
---
Shit is seriously fucked up. I really want battlegrounds to come soon.
---
&gt; Any person who has been outside of brm for the last couple of weeks knows the situation is very horde favored.
---
I don't think that's a fact. Some spots are horde camped (menthil probably?) while others are ally camped (mojache for example).
---
&gt; Arguing brm is a point of interest outside of people leveling is honestly not an arguement when you consider that the only time people visit it is in 40 man groups ready to raid.
---
Not really. There is UBRS, LBRS, BRD. Most of which provide useful stuff for everyone.
---
&gt; Mining nodes/water essence/elemental fire/felcloth
---
3 out of 4 of these are efficiently farmed in DM:E - therefore DME is a point of interest. Elemental fire is fastest farmed in Arathi Highlands - and guess who camped there any time I got close (on my alt, doesn't cross my mind to go there on main, I do it in BRD - again, adding to the fact that it's a location of interest).
---
&gt; major cities like winter spring gadgetzan are all horde favored
---
Those are not major cities. But wouldn't surprise me if there was more horde in BB/Gatget/Winterspring - but in reality, it's turn based and often ally favoured as well. It's interchangable, but I don't even visit those areas. Constant ally siege and no objectives. In fact, what is in any of these areas that's relevant? Only a waypoint to some niche locations.
---
&gt; making it very difficult for any alliance player to honestly do anything outside of dungeons
---
I scout Azuregos pretty much every day. Who runs there looking to make trouble? Alliance. I barely ever see horde running around - only other people watching Azuregos. But I will constantly be challenged by rabid PVPers. And mind you - this is on the porch of Orgrimmar.
---
Dungeons you say? The only way for me to get to DM is to go through second entrance, suicide and ghost walk to the entrance. The choke access towards it is  pretty much camped 24/7 by allies.
---
Same goes for BRM - going through south doesn't help one bit, you still have to go either upwards to the chain, where you'll get ganked, or you have to lava swim only to get ganked at the lower entrance towards depths of the mountain. There is about zero chance going through the Steppes entrance is going to make any difference, except take longer and cost more.
---
&gt; None of these are assumptions, it doesnt take an addon to search /who and see the numbers of players in each zone if you have a horde character.
---
Horde is more spread aroun the world and more present. For sure, since it's in larger numbers (as evident on world boss encounters). But that doesn't change the fact that Alliance is more PVP oriented, taking holds of most important locations. Why do I have to repeat myself?
---
&gt; And considering level 50+ points of interest, outside of brm, most quests for bis/prebis items occur in wpl epl. 
---
Quests? Most preraid bis items are acquired in dungeons. If we are talking quests, those usually involve blackrock mountain. There isn't much in EPL - except stratholme - which has some loot, true, but more than DM or BRM.
---
&gt; You need to recognize the difference between a small alliance party sitting in dm for an hour and a horde zerg that constantly washes over any point the alliance tries to contest outside of brm.
---
Of course, it's a reactionary move. If there is a group camping an area, a larger group will come to farm them - rightfully so. So it's usually alliance making the first grouping an then crying becuase they get zerged by larger, more numerous horde group. No shit, maybe don't do it then.
---
No flasks are needed if you have decent guild and want just clear the raid, they definitely help to do it faster/smoother
---
Wolves!
---
Oh yes, that's such a great episode! But I thought that was what it was as well
---
Okboomer
---
Lmfao... that's 22,2% more horde than alliance, definitely horde dominated.
---
Shield is the answer. Aside from shielding the eye, you also want to shield casters so they don't get pushback on their aoe if a random mob hits them.
---
Holy nova is amazing as well, if you're leveling with dungeons in mind you should definitely pick it up, and mana isn't an issue because your casters will be drinking 0-100 after every pull anyway. But you're right in that it shouldn't be expected from every priest.
---
It fun to watch, making the grind a competition? hell no.
---
As an event total disaster what would just promote account sharing and multiboxing. Jokerd shared account w his brother so the character was leveled 24/7. Method allegedly had some account sharing going on. And on the end some multiboxer would prolly win this shit.
---
Well yeah, he’s alliance
---
Blizzard won't fix the faction balance. So gotta make leveling on the dominant faction harder.
---
Any ideea if the regen generates threat?
---
This is my favourite
---
Bogoss! Bravo!
---
Yes, the person A is an asshole. 
---
Why? Because if everyone followed the lists and passed items that were upgrades for them, but were BiS for others everyone would get geared up more efficiently.
---
In your example if person A wins both players dont have optimal weapons and now if they both want to get the optimal weapon they need to farm for that item again.
---
If person B won he has the best item and only person A has to farm for the best item.
---
For a real example I farmed some BRD with my holy priest and Banthok Sashs dropped a few times and I passed it if a caster needed and it was an upgrade for me.
---
Why? Because I know that person will use the item for a long while, but for me I will just sell it pretty fast when I get my belt from Solakhar/last boss from DME.
---
If everyone follows the rule "Dont roll on upgrades for you, that are BiS for others" things go much smoothly and everyone gets what they want faster.
---
Man, that game was so bad yet so fun
---
You never know what the bus is till you're laying under it.
---
Currently playing a lvl 23 warrior . Tanked for a deadmines run and couldn't keep aggro . Planning on going fury for end game but obviously will find it hard too get a dps role in a dungeon until then .
---
Any tips for low level tanking? Or should I just pre-roll now for I invest too much time into my warrior ? 
---
Any help would be much appreciated . 
---
Thank you
---
Melees go in, gets spam healed. When they get debuff, run out to get dispelled, repeat. Im guessing thats how noob guilds could do that strat, while still getting melee to dps
---
He is auto attacking it only, aiming for the possibility that the Paladin missed his 0.5sec window and hearthed a little late or even that spell batching will fuck him up. This is literally the proper play in that situation, taking into consideration his hitpoints and how stupid spell batching is.
---
&gt; We ended up running 4 rogues and a shaman from sfk thru sm the first week, other guild cleave group poached our warrior so we just made it work, with some coordinating it was surprisingly smooth, rotating blade flurrys/evasions, lots of stuns and vanishing if it got bad.
---
Really not surprising, there's in fact a write up that talk about evasion [rogue](https://classicwow.live/guides/836/dodge-rogue-tanking-in-vanilla-rogue-tank-guide-by-caperfin) tanking.
---
And a chef..
---
Agamaggan Alliance checking in! Myx, NE Druid from &lt;Disbanded&gt;, &lt;Imperil&gt;, &lt;Outlandish&gt;, &lt;All We Do is PVP&gt; and others.
---
For the horde!
---
&gt;Why walk, when you can trip through time?
---
Ftfy
---
You're horde though.
---
I know a warlock who refuses to get dreadsteed because orcs gotta use wolves.
---
Didn't he only abuse it for the last two levels? In which case it only really mattered if it was about time in /played, and not if it was about who was first to 60
---
SS then ww and carry on sundering for those overpower hits
---
can you tell me the stats you had when you went to dm? so.. how much gold were you getting per hour at 44..   
---
Thanks.
---
Name one alliance dominated pvp server
---
**Hunter**
---
Is **Furious Howl**'s damage bonus normalized by the attack speed of the recepient, so that it adds the same amount of DPS for everyone, or does it just add the amount of dmg it says in the tooltip?
---
Bleh, getting accurate info on hunters can be hard sometimes.
---
I have 2 days 8 hours (played) and im 29 .. Im going slow or just regular?
---
FOR THE HORDE, BROTHER!!
---
Not really... asmongold have tried for weeks to get advertise banned... First for killing Special Olympus and now he got him banned from twitch... Its just bullshit.
---
How should people who never played private servers foresee that players would camp flight path and every single questing area ? In most people's mind PvP is about fighting people when you meet them in the world, not being killed 10v1 by gank squads camping every single corner of the world.
---
If you don't know how poorly designed WoW classic PvP is it doesn't even occur to you to look for those things. It's easy (and utterly pointless) to say "search for it beforehand" when you already know about something.
---
Activision/Blizzard executives are morons who are trying to "lean down" the company. It's the only explanation that makes any sense. To use an analogy, there's a reason you die at &lt;2% body fat.
---
Wrong version of the game bud :)
---
my plan is to do the exact same as you, 2nd account for the twink, so I can run it through instances or quests to get the items I need.  I have a lvl 60 resto shammy, and currently leveling a druid tank (level 52). once I get the druid to 60, I'm turning my attention to the twink hunter. :D
---
Woops meant gobbos
---
&gt; Mongooses are weasel-like creatures that belong to the group of Carnivores.
---
fascinating, tell me more!
---
Found the huntard
---
Better to fly from Grom'gol, perhaps even if you start in UC. Although there is some benefit to being able to AFK.
---
Ive had that happen to me, i dont remember which specific flight points you had to pic and fly from. 
---
OP which ones was it you picked
---
Ow mah Gwad
---
It's also prepaid bis for the hunter. Dont be ridiculous.
---
Just a reminder, try to grab the BOEs while they are still affordable. Maybe it's already a lil too late now, well...
---
The way they turned Kael into a demented maniac to turn him into a raid boss during the WoW Safari era (late Vanilla, BC, WOTLK mostly) was quite disheartening.
---
This character was duty and nobility incarnate. He was Arthas but without the madness and cruel fate. And I know a lot of people agreed that this was what made Kael pretty compelling. He does follow Illidan's questionable plans at time, but his personality is nothing like his portrayal in BC.
---
I don't buy the explanation they gave, I mean it doesn't appear to be more than a justification instead of a compelling exploration of the character. It's just dumb to exploit the demonic influences of this world to just corrupt anyone at will. It's espcially dumb when they pulled it out for a character whose very fundamental aspect was incorruptability.
---
The Alliance dominated servers are generally PvE servers
---
&gt; Considering hunters ignore half the effects on the weapon and only use the hit and crit, fuck no. -stam isn't a problem for DPSers. A guild clearing Naxx isn't going to have DPSers dying a bunch from the difference of that much HP.
---
It's BiS for a melee hunter.
---
Whatever, I get run over by groups as well, everyone does, only the wuss paladin bubble/hearths to get out of it.    Nothing makes me happier then when they mess up and die either during or just before the hearth goes off.
---
Dang, I wish I knew someone trying to make money on your server :P
---
No offense, but parsing is absolutely irrelevant in conjunction with PVP. It's not about parsing being easy or not.    
---
Gona watch the guide anyway, just wanted to react to the parsing thing. I don't care what's your name, I will watch it and make my own opinion based on the actual information in the guide. One can always learn something new.
---
Was there truly *no-one* that joined a group and killed some mobs in their new layer that weren't there before? I know Jokerd intentionally skipped around them but honestly, does it matter when everyone else has access to the same system? I'd hardly call it "abusing" when Blizzard didn't care about people layer hopping whatsoever, everyone was doing it
---
So twitch has rules and if people break the rules then they can be punished. Either he broke the rules and he deserves the punishment or he didn't and its a lapse in the policies from twitch. It has nothing to do with a streamer, how would he have admin powers with twitch to ban any account he wants?
---
Horde big dumb 
---
Upvote to left
---
Need is a hard word here. Having 6% hit allows you to land your special attacks, which you’re going to need to keep threat. You may very well be able to tank with less than 6% but you’ll be handicapping your threat. I’d recommend you have two sets, or at least combinations, of gear, one for threat and one for mitigation (eventually FR gear, too).
---
A video of actual pvp as opposed to another video of someone landing at a FP and getting insta killed by 8 rogues.
---
Just slightly slow. I think you should hit 35 with that time. I wouldnt worry too much.
---
&gt; Oh jeez, I wish they were. Could have been a fun twist...
---
They do in fact exist. There's even a whole discord dedicated to [them](https://discord.gg/9V73rJX) for dungeon and raid tanking.
---
Pre-raid bis.. and raid bis. 2 different things, DERP.
---
Or just make dishonorable kills not exist at all.
---
No one supported it in 05, no one should support it today.
---
I know some private servers had an expiration date. Meaning every few months the server would reset and everybody would race to 60 again.
---
So player B *is* entitled, then.
---
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! Sturgeons commonly range from 7–12 feet (2-3½ m) in length, while some species grow up to 18 feet (5.5 m).
---
So is it cyberbullying to kill people in wow?   
---
Cause thats what twitch as Asmongold is claiming.
---
I was leveling feral druid tank and got from lvl 54 to 59 in BRD. With 5/5 stealth stale t +NE passive stealth bonus +Night Boots 12AGI +1 stealth rank even T1 Rogues could not catch me because I was out of sight in a half of a second if stepped a bit from their point blank range. So I had 0 deaths if no Hunters were around.
---
That changed when I started healing on lvl 60. 6-9 deaths every run.
---
It depends on which class you play with. If you are AoE mage or Hunter you are slow, otherwise it's okay.
---
&gt; Warnings about PVP servers were here in this sub, were on wow forums, were based on different servers experience and current community changed mentality (From vanilla). Most of them aren't really difficult to make a conclusion yourself even if you are ignorant to warnings.
---
As someone who tried to warn people that Phase 2 was gonna be quite awful for people not yet 60 and the faction with less players, I can say that my voice (and the voices of others) were almost inaudible in comparaison of the number of people spamming #nochange and repeating how much world PvP was a blast and perfect. Also I think that very few people really anticipated on how industrial the ganking would become on some servers. (personally I knew it would be bad but not that bad)
---
My point is that of course, the people who were on this sub for months and never played Vanilla probably got the warning that it wasn't as good as most people were pretending but I really can understand how someone getting interested a week before the release only saw post about "PvP servers are the best"
---
10 days played is about average if you wont keep proffesions up to level all the time and/or afk a lot. Around lvl 45-47 (cant remeber the exact level) is about halfway there to reach 60.  
---
tldr i would say you are doing fine :)
---
i can't read.
---
God you are so shit, do you even know how much hit is needed not to miss my yellows. fuck off
---
Not really. Hit is the best way to increase your threat, but at the end of the day 1% missing hit is still around 1% less damage/threat. You also have a higher chance of missing your first ability or two and losing threat as a result, but that can happen anyway due to dodges/parries.
---
never really referred to a twink as a pro tbh
---
Same with prot tanking lists to be honest, some guides recommend full mitigation gear, others full threat gear, some a halfway house between the two.
---
It's hilarious how the tables have turned on this server
---
Anathema.
---
Yeah what i meant was. "We already have a feral"
---
I mean nowdays lots of people seem to think that going bananas on dps = faster kill. But there are lots of fights where like you say communication and execution is more important.
---
We dont care about official statements... What does it even matter?   
---
Reality is that we get banned for ganking special Olympus
---
If alliance had the majority, they'd be doing the same thing.   Ask Heartseeker, an 80/20 alliance controller server.   Horde camped just as bad as any alliance crying tears on any forum they can find.   
---
It has nothing to do with faction, it has to do with humanity.
---
i mean you said it yourself the game is 15 years old. just tell people you're a noob and most will be happy to explain shit to you man, its not a huge deal
---
There is no reason to not dps during Garr.
---
Throw down COS on the add, banish it, curse Garr and start dotting all the adds.
---
Just keep an eye on your banish target and get ready to rebanish with 5s left.
---
I usually have 300 dps on this fight.
---
Slightly below average. You should install TitanPanel and check your exp-per-hour.  
---
It should start with 7k per hour around level 15, then go up to 10-12k to 20 and 30k per hour around level 30+.
---
that item saved me probably thousands in repair costs and potions as a healer. I always keep it on hand. One free health/mana potion on the Healthstone/darkrune cooldown every hour.
---
Lol, good point.
---
Haha! It kinda serves you right, die with honour!
---
You might want to think about typical situation of hpal+good geared warrior against sl lock+horde healer of your choice. I hardly doubt it's in lock favor and warrior+hpal will be the most common seen pair on bgs I guess.
---
I got to the  “turn off your headlights” and nosed out
---
I hate this thing where people are expected to not take something that's an upgrade for them because an item is on wowhead's bis list for someone else. regardless of whether wowhead is correct or not.
---
If it's an upgrade, it's an upgrade.
---
How tf you solo farm ZF graves at 44 is a mystery to me. I'm in pre-bis at 60 and I still die all the time; any occasional resist to a slow and I have to aggro reset or get fucked. Perhaps I should've held on to the int+stam gear instead of all that spell power?
---
In any case, BRD can be AoE farmed; I heard that's also what JokerD did on his alt. [I suppose you can do this for xp as well, though I haven't tried it at a low level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx8TWTEfaZM)
---
Haha yeah no server is alliance dominated or balanced and this experience is unique to you and your pretend team
---
Nah, it's PW:Shield
---
Heartseeker
---
It's absurd for anybody not to take an upgrade
---
depends. sometimes you don't need a full dark rune or demonic rune but more then a mana pot. 
---
I can handle most fights in current content as a healer with greater mana potions and lei of lilies or straight up no consumes. Very rarely a Dark Rune on Rag or Ony depending on size of raid.
---
Earthshaker
---
I disagree.
---
Maybe not the title then but definitely the mount and shoulders. They also had full teams. We also had a lot of gladiator/merciless gladiator/ vengeful gladiator titles in our guild.
---
I’d bet money they a couple fresh new realms once the original realms are well into naxx.  Blizz gotta get that fresh reroll subscriber money.
---
Lol I had a brainfart. I meant +spell dmg
---
it's not as if wowhead lists are without reproach
---
You are literally the kind of person this post is complaining about
---
That is fine, anyone can interpret it in any way they wish. To be fair, though, the latter two quotes that you cherrypicked are in response to that quite a snarky reply aimed at me, I thought I was just switching over to a lingo that was more in line with the post to which it is a reply.
---
And never did I state that they're saying new people can't play, if you think that you must have misinterpreted something; my issue was, and still is, with the way one poster expressed themselves. I too feel that people should do some research to better themselves so I agree with that point, it's in their own interest after all - but there are way more constructive ways to say so than the line I quoted in my very first reply.
---
I probably got a steep guild member discount.
---
I'm glad i got to the bottom of it. You require no facts to start a witch hunt. Gl on it I guess. I'm guessing most people would like some kind of evidence of this so you won't have much luck at getting the masses to join you.
---
I'll gladly do this as revenge on horde for jumping in 10v1 everywhere else.
---
So you dont believe it before twitch says "Yes we ban people"  
---
What official statement you want?
---
As far as I know, WoW is still using SRP for login and RC4 as encryption.
---
Can you give example of security flaws in vanilla client?
---
If you're running as part of a guild and you're optimising for the current and next raid tier, then it makes sense for people to pass upgrades to each other.
---
If you're running with pugs who you only met 20 minutes ago, and in another 20 minutes might never see them again, it doesn't give you any benefit at all not to take an upgrade.
---
at work hoping I got rank 3 so I can afford my epic mount... im anxious
---
I lost savage gladiators chain to our resto shaman last night :( I'm not salty at all!
---
This is 95% a horde thing tho. With single digits outliers on Alliance.
---
But I'm holy :(
---
Did you read beyond my first paragraph?
---
I never bought any greens off the AH and am parsing 70+ for my gear bracket. Thank you for telling people to buy my overpriced greens on the AH however, couldn't have gotten my epic mount at 59 without you guys.
---
Whats the song name?
---
Fact is people get banned from Twitch after asmon report em for ganking.  
---
Thats fact
---
/F
---
he got no honor tho
---
As a healer for over 10 years, what you should look at is, at the end of the fight did you have mana left over? did anyone die?   
---
If yes to both, then you aren't using your spells effectively. You want to use the best you can while making best use of your mana, sitting at 100% mana is a waste of time - try to sit around 60-80% waiting for burst damage phases, that way you are making use of mana regen mechanics.  
---
Biggest thing is just get out there and practise, you will soon pick up what is best to use when, But dont think I will only use rank 2 or something, use Rank 2 and 4 depending on the situation. You can use macros wtih a shift,CRTL or alt multiplier to change the spell.
---
You say your not using any healing addons, get Clique, it will change your whole outlook on healing. No more click then press the heal - saves so much when raid healing.
---
Completely agree. But they are the bare minimum starting point.
---
I think that counts as punishing compared to ranged. Running in and out is going to hurt your dps.
---
It’s my first time playing WoW and I chose a PVP server because my friend told me that it’s way more fun.
---
Honestly laughing at the kind of people who whip out the spit macros at any opportunity.
---
Their weak bones crush nicely beneath my gnome foot.
---
Anyone using TellMeWhen?
---
Wondering if I can make an icon/alert appear when I'm missing X amount of Mana for purpose of getting a "chug that potion now" thing going. I'm currently just looking at my mana bar, but since I use TMW for other stuff I wondered if this is possible. So, is it doable, or do I have to get WA for this?
---
dont wanna pvp, you shouldnt have joined a pvp server. i have no sympathy for anyone who complains about anything on a pvp server
---
Our guild just sold one for 999g as alliance. We had two of them drop during MC last week. 🤔
---
Ah yes, a slight TPS increase is definitely worth it over a huge dps increase. Giving PB to warriors over rogues is pants-on-head-tier. Absolute madness.
---
You don't actually lose 20% per week. If your final rank adjustment for the week is negative, it is halved, and then further capped at 2.5k. So you lose at most 10% of your total rank points, or half a rank (once you're R7+).
---
I don't normally ignore anyone (exception: spammers, I want to be able to actually read the LFG-channel) so I use [CharacterNotes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/character-notes) addon to make notes on other players. The notes can be positive, neutral or negative so you can flag good players with them as well. The notes are synced to all my characters so if I play on my alt I can read notes made when playing my main. Of course if the other player is on an alt, I don't know that but it works well enough.
---
For example in chat the addon shows if I have made note on that player, so if I see a green tag in /LFG next to someone's name I know I liked that guy at some point so I'm more inclined to join.
---
&gt;  Bought Robes og Insight for my priest for 12 gold in lvl 42, and I used it way into 60 untill i got my tier chest
---
But... but... Truefaith
---
"talk shit get hit" colorized
---
This is the druid T0/dungeon Wildheart set.
---
Your guild doesn't travel together?
---
You are giving away so little by passing on your non bis upgrades like 99% of the time it should be expected so everyones experiences is better.
---
I don't know where you get your "honorable vs. pussy" notion from, but to me it seems fairly obvious that sticking around to get killed just for the sake of... what exactly? being a man? seems utterly stupid, especially if so much of your game time is taken up by getting mindlessly ganked. Horde or Alliance, if you can get out of a shitty situation, do it. Rogues vanish/sprinting? Mages iceblocking? What's the difference? Why blame the one getting away and not the thirsty pieces of shit who can't get enough of zerg-camping?
---
Horde life on RP-PvP realms.
---
Hey guys, I'd like some advice from priest players. 
---
I'm a disc priest and a healer for our guild. I've just received my 4th set of T1 gear (boot) and I was wondering if it's an worthwhile investment to buy the T1 waist?
---
Just a little background, our guild uses loot council and we've yet to acquire a single priest belt from MC. If it ever drops, other members will get the priority over me. God knows when I'll ever get one. 
---
I'm currently using Whipvine Cord atm. 
---
With this in mind, would it be stupid to buy one to get the 5th set bonus? The belts are going around 270g in my server and the lowest I've seen is 240g. There's one going for 250g atm which, I'm not sure if I should pull the trigger or not. 
---
Also, I don't mind spending gold as I have nothing to do at the moment. I currently have 750g and I can farm if I'm desperate for it.
---
Alliance sucks as hell 🤣🤣🤣👏👌🤪.
---
Horde forever🔥🔥🔥🔥
---
You have to have full tier 1, every egr item, and bad opponents.
---
I totally forgot about the engineering flying mounts those were so cool.
---
This is why I don't invite hunters when doing arena/anger runs :)
---
it appears either some people dont get sarcasm or theyre easily offended
---
Maybe but my point is just that this sub was so full of  "world PvP is sooooo fun" with tales about the awesomeness of SS-TM, how fantastic it was when your raid met another in Blackrock and stories about of outsmarting two opponents while leveling and very few: "95% of PvP you'll have will be one side stomping on the other and it can get quite boring for some"
---
And no it's not a minority. I mean have you seen how this sub changed? one month ago, if you said bad things about Classic, you were vilipend almost immediately and now there's daily "phase 2 is quite a disaster" at first place. I mean how do you explain that those post get so much upvotes? that there's a silent majority of player not getting on reddit? of course but those people tend to be more casual and if there's one type of player that hate the current state of the game, it's them.

Super horde dominated thx

Zug zug mother*ucker

Because alliance don't pvp and its the only honor they can find.
---
Heartseeker is approaching 50/50 balance now
---
Not it's not. You're trying too hard to apply the logic behind the Dunning-Kruger effect in place where it doesn't make sense.
---
The Dunning-Kruger effect is about how people perceive their own knowledge on a topic relative to others, it's not about taking decisions with incomplete knowledge, especially not for a scenario like picking a PvP server because you have prior experience in other games.
---
The effect is about more knowledgeable people overestimating the abilities of others (hence not realizing they are far more knowledgeable than them) and people who barely know anything not understanding enough about the topic to realize their own inability.
---
You're right, they should release content slower so more content creators get bored and move on to other games. I'm a boomer gamer dad and I'm ready for phase 3.
---
I was also leveling a twink rogue for the lv19 bracket, but then i had a change of heart and decided to go hunter.
---
Rogue will b about the raw nuke because no cheap shot at that level for some cc.
---
You can kill the adds before the boss separately
---
If you’re trying different things enter from burning steppes. It still exists.
---
A straight feral tank or dps spec is hot garbage for pvp.  The gear is also trash.  You would be better off as 0/30/21 with tier 1 for pvp.
---
It’s dropped twice for our guild. Second time it dropped I rolled a 99 and our warlock rolled a 100 right after me :(
---
There have been so many posts about it being a good server, which have led to a lot more allies it seems.
---
Also a dumb ally rogue camping kargath for afk kills and finishing people off after duels.
---
Elsewhere in the thread someone made a good point for your consideration:
---
It's hard to know that you are misinformed about something. If you've gotten bad or misleading information already (such as the game itself presenting PvE servers as not having PvP at all or saw some stuff on a bad website) then you've put in that minimal effort and...been misled. This is why I make a point to be patient with 100% of people who fuck up. It's possible that they're just like the idiot last night who stood and complained that they couldn't click the IF flightmaster for 15 minutes through multiple explanations of how to keybind "interact with target" and /tar gryth but I believe it's more likely that they *did* put in some effort to determine the proper thing and got the wrong answer.
---
Have you ever been killed in Orgrimmar inn?
---
This happened to me yesterday. I'm a mage and after being ganked over and over by rogues at morgan's vigil (where I couldn't even turn in the 2 quests I had completed nor could I make it to the flight master) and the run back is literally 13 miles.  I finally took rez sickness and ported to IF. I ran into the reagents store to grab more runes and BAM, another rogue stunned and  destroyed me.  It was so frustrating. The game is literally infested with these sadistic fucks. I really wish I never rolled on a PvP server..I never knew it was so bad.
---
There's a lot of loot out there that's not on any bis list. You take that loot on the way to reaching your bis items, and it helps you get your bis items faster. You don't level up naked until one day you reach full bis, you take incremental upgrades until you reach your final goal. Many people never hit full bis at any tier, they're in a permanent state of partial bis, gradually getting closer to full bis.
---
They could do that, on my server they dont though so BS all the way
---
The logic behind it is, bgs are just crazy better honor/hour than WPvP so most of the FP camping and BRM camping will be gone because it won’t add up even close to a BG. Yes there will be queues and probably longer queues for horde. 
---
If you queue then fly to Kargath and run to BRM during the queue, sure there will still be horse camping BRM. But will they do that every single queue? That’s why people think it’ll alleviate this issue.
---
Also, just because someone rolled PvE doesn’t mean they don’t like PvP. So hopefully they queue too and the queues won’t be too long for Horde which would almost entirely fix the current situation.
---
"g o T o RE T a IL"  is my favorite
---
Yes but it doesn't fly

Can you be honour capped for the week?

What is EGR?
---
21 pts are the most I'd put into the holy tree right now. But I healed MC/Rag just fine even with zero points in it. Takes more potions/runes though.
---
Except is a 1 hander that's quick and has a low top end damage. I'd rather have a lot of things over it. 
---
It's not workless but the same person has been trying to sell one on incidious for a week.
---
You're a shame.
---
I have an alt on another server and whenever I'm logged in I seem to be getting messages spammed usually in the /1 channel
---
That operation is not permitted in this channel.  
---
It happens from every 2-10 minutes, and it always appears 3 times at once.
---
But I don't know what is causing it. I'm assuming it is an addon - but as far as I can see I have the exact same addons enabled on each realm.
---
Any ideas?
---
If a rogue gets the jump on you, you wont get control of your character before you die.
---
Oh :(
---
if its not from your origin race you wount be able to use it (because the riding skill will be missing)
---
if you are a tauren and he buys a codo for you then yes, it will work
---
but till you can ride you should already have more than enoth rep to have the discount yourself
---
ayaya
---
good for fury and i wear axes instead of rends.
---
He sounds fine, you sound like a moron.
---
Imagine looking into gearing and systems of a game you're going to spend tens or hundreds of hours playing.
---
&gt;I've probably played this game longer than you,
---
Now who's being elitist.
---
Horde players just know its pvp and roll with it. Alliance and Horde do retaliatory gank squads, etc. and you just go to another area. 
---
This is the only one that was hilarious though and is one sided.  Bubble hearthing is so common that rogues took it a step further.
---

Hey guys!

Where in the combat logs can i see how many times i dodged/parry Rags attacks?

Thx &lt;3
---
If you're a PvP server then the stamina from T1 is more important that an additional +50 healing and mp5
---
Literally 18 hours after launch
---
Yes.

I hope you get wrecked....I hate gnomes, when I’m not playing one.

Exactly what I would have said if I were them to discourage you from doing it more.

Weeell isn't it BiS for Enhancement and Retribution as well? You just ignore those too? :P
---
Hey there! Is there an addon that can show me the loot table of a mob when hovering over it?
---
Damn man, i feel for you m8.
---
I´ve lost the staff too, first time on a roll, the second we were already using dkp and a lock had more than me.
---
I´m a mage main and blade is the sweetest, but if could get my hands on staff i would b more than pleased :)
---
In Phase 1 the servers were layered and so someone wouldn't be insane to expect that their experience with population numbers would have carried on. Sure, they could have delved into Blizzard's statements about Phase 2 plans but did they know that they needed to know this? I think what Blizzard did with layering, megaservers, and then turning off layering is amongst the most insane things I've ever seen a video gaming company do. Not being hyperbolic here either. As the host committed an insane act, I do not believe that sane people should have been expected to anticipate or guard against it.
---
Outside of being seen by every human from 10-15yatds and never getting and opener?
---
And more people would be closer to the full bis listening to my advice. 
---
I could have stolen a bunch of caster loot as a healer, but I did not. I used my crap from ST instead of stealing come caster item, using it for a bit before replacing it. The content is so easy it barely matters if I you are doing a 5man with a quest item or a item you stole from somebody that isnt your bis.
---
Now I'm curious what would happen if someone dies between after hearth finishes casting but before teleporting.
---
Same.  Though it does kind of suck that I'm horde on an 80% Alliance server and they basically keep the org flight master dead.
---
I keep hoping it will get old to them, but apparently it never does.
---
Because alliance has less frustrates kids that die 10 times to kill 1 afk player in iron forge.
---
Because that same paladin would be corpse camping in a heart beat if they could, then bubble hearth the instant they might die.   I see it all the time.     Paladin in that video was CLEARLY fighting, and when the odds turned bad, bubble/hearthed.    Can a hunter get away in that situation?  How about a warrior?  Mage can delay, but will die too.  Rogues will be dotted and unable to escape.   ONLY the Paladin gets this ability to just say "nope, you aren't allowed to get a kill you deserve to get because I picked a bad fight".     I mostly just despise Paladins.   A bullshit overpowered class in a PvP setting with cleanse, freedom, LoH, and Bubble.   Its a shame a heavy nerf bat was never correctly swong at them between 2004-2006 so we could be playing THAT.
---
I just don't invite them along! Why stack classes that will all need one one rare item in the same group? Just inefficient.
---
Okay, that's your opinion. I very much disagree. 
---
He spent half a post talking to me like I'm new to the game, and I offered a counterpoint. 
---
Thanks for your major contribution to this thread, though. Highly useful input.
---
Can anyone tell me what this song is
---
I blame u for being flagged in IF :)
---
I dont use tailoring ^^
---
Is be fuming if someone turned up to a raid in Gera that's *literally* useless. He can't even downrank he'll constantly be oom and the run will take longer. I didn't say he had to have bis but gear appropriately for fuck sake.
---
If you're on desktop they're on the sidebar to the right
---
Anything official would do. But the ramblings of some kid on twitch is not really evidence that a multibillion dollar company banned someone because he said so lol
---
I was trying this on a rogue for a while even in stealth people would accidentally walk over me and slaughter me, eventually I said fuck it and I put all my gear in the bank and whenever I would die I would just spirit rez and walk back. Eventually the Horde decided to pity me and leave me be, as I was completely naked running from the tomb to Hearthglen. 1/10 would do it again...
---
Well I can solo arena faster than a group can clear Arena/Anger, so it's not really an issue for me. And I'm pretty sure SGC is literally the only item I want out of BRD.
---
But it's still annoying people think Hunters shouldn't roll on their best in slot chest just because they want it more.
---
If you don't express that you don't know something or ask for help everyone expects you to know it. The game is 15 years old and none of this is new
---
Pretty much.  They're bad, and she outgears them by a mile.  I'd guess full tier 1 vs mediocre blues without enchants.
---
They'd see a red name yeah, just not the one with health bar
---
There doesn't have to be a lore reason. What is the lore reason that undead players aren't flagged as undead (anymore)? There isn't one. It was a decision made entirely for the health of the game.
---
I don't know that those suggestions are good ideas, but lack of lore justification is waaaay down at the bottom of the list of potential cons.
---
This is how you master the AH my friend. Buy raid consumables during days and times where guilds dont normally raid. (Wednesday/Thursday 11pm server time) resell during peak raiding times (5-8pm Fri-Sunday and Tuesday) You'll find that these items sell very quick and for substantially more than what you paid for it. It's super easy
---
From what I have heard they are going to be cross-realm battleground/queues (I haven't seen confirmation on this).
---
And I don't beleive horde have an overwhelming majority over all servers.  If the queues mix PvP and PvE servers, then it is alliance who have more players overall, so they will be the ones with the longer queues.  
---
But it will still be impossible to really say right now.
---
If the average BG queue is 30 seconds, then there will be no real reason to go into open world since they wouldn't have time to do anything.  
---
If the average queue is 30 minutes then yes it might be a problem still.
---
But overall I would imagine they if people are constantly queueing, over half their time will be spent actually inside the BG, so their time in open world will be a lot less.
---
Things will definitely improve, it's just tough to say by how much.
---
Im a holy priest and i usualy use smoll boy no kill. Some gnomes laugh and stop
---
Always drink to full health and fire ward before tempting the wrath of the fire gods. Especially if you are a gnome.
---
On my server it's essentially guaranteed to happen any time you hearth or IF port.
---
cuz they're in full tier 1 epics
---
 /Sit is privateserver BS. Does not work in classic
---
Dancing to overpower is worth, but only if you're good. It can easily backfire.
---
Its not hard to search Vanilla server populations and compare them to Classic. The game was designed for far less people in each server. What, you think there were 10k+ people in each server back in the day? Blizz just fucked up. 
---
&gt;Pointing the finger at Blizz as you virtually surround a guy with your friends and kick the shit out of him until he logs off doesn't absolve you of guilt or justify your actions in the honor department.  
---
&gt;Saying, 'this was going to happen anyway' as you virtually surround a guy with your friends and kick the shit out of him until he logs off doesn't absolve you of guilt or justify your actions in the honor department, either.
---
What guilt? What honor? If you're playing on a 70-80% majority server then you're already not having fun yourself. It's just PvE and the couple of minority people you find are just rare mobs to you. So why would you care if someone else is not having fun and will quit when you already are not having fun and will probably quit as well. 
---
Also, why in the hell should a game make you choose to either pvp or let someone else to play while the reason MOST people play this game is to pvp? There's no repeatable content, there's no grinds, no M+, nothing. You do a raid for 1 night each week and you either pvp or farm. Blizz just fucked with the numbers and estimations. You say youre not sure if the numbers of that copypasta are correct but you dont bother to verify and act as if they are false while being true gives defeats your whole argument. 
---
Lastly, for your info, im on the receiving end. I play on Shazzrah Alliance, a 30% minority. Every time my grp tries to pvp is an uphill battle and I/we always end up getting gank-raped by 5x our numbers. The ratio is just waay to off to even have a chance to fight and **should I not point my finger to the freakin developers who didn't bother with this root issue at all?** They even opened up universal migration instead of faction-only and any server with a slight skewed ration got completely one-sided. Then ofc when it was already too late implemented faction-only servers with no incentive for people to actually leave the majority. 
---
From what I see I think you're lucky. You don't seem to care much about pvp and ranking so I hope one day you have the nice choice of either transfer to PvE or migrate to Ally dominated servers. If Blizz doesnt accommodate you then you might want to just re-roll to one or whatever. 
---
As for me (and many others i think) there's no reason to play on anything other than a relatively balanced PvP server. If that doesn't work then, yeah, we will eventually quit the game. I will wait and see if something changes with battlegrounds, hope something happens.
---
I am a lvl 59 Arms warrior and cannot hold aggro at all.
---
Currently 31/rest/0
---
I tried tanking Scholo at 58 and LBRS at 59 and both were terrible experiences. 
---
I was doing fine at BRD, my usual tactic is charge with a 2h then do sweeping strikes+whirlwind, swap to 1h and shield and tab sunder/revenge/shieldbash for the remainder of the fight. Taunt when necessary.
---
But at Scholo/LBRS I was just losing aggro instantly followed by me running around like a chicken trying to fetch the mobs with taunt and mocking blow. I even lost aggro to the healer, which has not happened to me before. 
---
It got even worse when the grp suggested to sap/poly some of the mobs because then i couldnt whirlwind and I felt like having no chance to gain aggro with sunder/revenge alone.
---
Having run a lot of BRD I think I am adequatly geared, even got 2 of the deathbone pieces (leg and gauntlet) from scholo, but that did not matter for LBRS at all.
---
Do you have any advice for me? Should I just use the 2h for everything or put on my dps set? Should I respec to 31/5/rest ?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
We have a few rogues that live in Ironforge.
---
Stop being a cunt.
---
Why not Truefaith for PvE and T1 for PvP?
---
I wish it would come later, I doubt I can beat RDR2 in 5 days.
---
don't feel too bad, I'm sure you and your buddies are having a blast standing in Ironforge all day
---
I agree with both of you. There's no need to make any excuse at all about quitting either, do whatever the fuck you wanna do.
---
Sorry but that the most stupid thing i ever heard!   
---
Twitch never come with officiel statements why they ban people!   
---
But Asmongold said it him self, that he banned Advertise for ganking him!
---
I understand the use of fire resistance. Lol
---
The question was why does a guild need to do this to kill rag.  It should be easy without it
---
Warriors are better at the high end. Check most speed runs, they're done with 20 warriors, not 20 rogues.
---
The honor system is honetsly the reason why i stopped playing again. I hate it.
---
No other game that I know of allow griefing on such a large scale. I think no one argues that players in general have poor behavior, that's why games have mechanics to limit it to a minimum.
---
The point is not that people expected 0 griefers, but the vast majority of players who barely played Vanilla back then or didn't even play it could not predict that the game allowed large scale griefing. The effect is amplified by the over population on servers, once again something players can't possibly predict. People are not pissed because they got killed once by a rogue while farming in Winterspring, they're pissed because the vast majority of the PvE content is unplayable due to constant unfair PvP going on at every somewhat relevant place.
---
I've been playing games for a long time and I tend to look up games a bit before getting into it. I didn't play WoW vanilla, it never occured to me to search specifically about griefing on PvP servers. Why would I look for answers to a question I don't even know exist ?
---
Lul cant pvp at 60 so you gotta twink feels bad
---
you think battlegrounds will help this?  It'll be the same thing but between their ganks they'll be afk for rewards
---
A screenshot would have been evidence, not proof.
---
All about the logs :D
---
I know so many people with stockpiles of black lotus that the market will never be starved.
---
I don't play anywhere close to 8 hours a day - just get herbalism or mining, you'll have more gold than you can spend. Or do one of the many many *many* gold farming guides online that bring in 40-100g an hour.
---
I hit 60 on my first character with over 600g just from selling greens and crap on the AH. Take some time to learn how the economy in the game works and you'll have a ton of gold.
---
lolmage
---
It does, simply stand up at the same time the enemy swings at you. Works for stacking reckoning and proccing enrange
---
All of the "is it worth" questions are something only you can answer. We dont know many things like how is your gold situation, how much you care about having epics, how hardcore is your guild, how long you are willing to wait and so on.
---
I personally would buy it, 250g isnt that much but again only you know the answer.
---
I've met a lot of ppl that never played wow before and decided to play classic.
---
How do they do it?!
---
Plater name plate addon is great for this
---
This is what I'm doing too, and still do way more damage then other classes. 2 hour mc clear with most of our warrs as arms, that's fine enough for me.
---
Arms is not a viable raid spec in later tiers. Mortal strike is a high priority debuff.
---
The macro definitely works, I use that myself.  It's a single button click to switch stance and cast overpower (you don't have to spam click it like some macros).
---
But as rawr said, to get notified when overpower is available will need an addon of some sort.  
---
WeakAuras2 is great and very customisable (though really dificult to learn, hence go to  [https://wago.io/classic-weakauras](https://wago.io/classic-weakauras) and find a suitable one you can import)
---
There's probably other addons to do it, but i don;t know which.
---
This was already posted yesterday under a different title. Karma farm?
---
Do a bit of pvp for rank 3 for the extra 100g discount :)
---
Blizzard has given an incentive for level 60s to go out and gank everyone.  This had added thousands of gankers/griefers to the normal amount you have on a PvP server 
---
The servers are very much playable with the normal gankers/griefers but with the phase 2 honor farm going on the zones are not.
---
Once the BGs open you are taking all of those players and putting them in an instance.  Everything goes back to normal and people can level with only the usual amount of ganking
---
Pretty sure its the childish and immature reactions people have when they realize you don't know, but whatever.
---
&gt;95% of PvP you'll have will be one side stomping on the other and it can get quite boring for some
---
I am yet to see a significant amount of complaints about how boring is one-sidingly stomping others though. I expect to see it still but that's more like related to people having a reality check on the whole PVP ladder grind to upper ranks (which they were actually warned about as well).
---
&gt;and no it's not a minority.
---
They ARE a minority by default. Don't you see how most of their complaints are about being on the minority faction and faction imbalance? 
---
I am definitely not saying about the state of this subreddit, since happy people just play the game and don't go here to complain.
---
Even if you consider people complaining here, just check the amount of upvotes compared to amount of people on this sub. 
---
Of course people who suffer do care, so they upvote etc. etc. that's why it's called vocal. It doesn't mean they are majority since, again, all their issues come from the fact they are overwhelmed by horde by a huge margin.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias
---
Herbalism is an insane money maker! Otherwise for a warrior I think finding a partner and doing jump runs in DM are super profitable. Check out a few YouTube guides for that one.
---
You really don't have to spend a lot of time playing to get gold. I certainly don't play 8 hours a day or whatever.. 2-3 hours a night 3-4 nights a week.
---
I love that you fail to see the irony that your first reply was mocking people and calling them cry babies, but here you are having the biggest rage/cry of anyone on this thread.
---
Didn't think horde could say Boomer. Wish I knew how.
---
**Negativity bias**
---
The negativity bias, also known as the negativity effect, is the notion that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events) have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than neutral or positive things.  In other words, something very positive will generally have less of an impact on a person's behavior and cognition than something equally emotional but negative.  The negativity bias has been investigated within many different domains, including the formation of impressions and general evaluations; attention, learning, and memory; and decision-making and risk considerations.

&gt; And more people would be closer to the full bis listening to my advice. 
---
Yes more people would be closer to full bis, but that doesn't mean that everyone is closer to full bis, some people are further way from it or take longer to reach it. This is like the inequality argument that some people advance: we should outsource jobs/not tax the wealthy because it increases the overall size of the pie, so that even though outsourcing jobs might put you into grinding poverty, overall the entire country will be better off.  As an individual, you want you or your friends/guild to advance, but it would be silly to put the average level of gear on the server ahead of your gear or your guild's gear. If a guild invites some randoms to their MC group, they don't operate a loot council that says "oh random pug X gains the most from this item, he should get the item ahead of anyone in the guild". If a guild wouldn't prioritise gearing up the server, why would an individual prioritise gearing up the server?
---
In any case, if you're levelling a healer then you absolutely should be taking both dps and healer loot. Healer loot doesn't really help you complete quests. Getting a mob killed one gcd sooner gets you where you're going to more quickly.
---
Of course hunters should roll for it, but if you're making a group it seems silly to stack it with people that all need one already rare item.
---
If you are new/inexperienced, telling your party will often lead them to giving you advice or directing you to a source that will help you. Most players are nice to newcomers
---
Server?
---
ROFL
---
&gt; 2h Arms is awful for raids.
---
&gt;But we have full geared rogues with pblade and they were behind me in damage so...
---
If your not in a hardcore guild pushing 30s boss fights what the heck is the difference if the warrs roll arms.
---
Yes.. But in the beginning i wasnt talking about noob guilds. Everything is punishing a noob guild in MC lul
---
Or caster lol
---
Atiesh
---
from my point of view #nochanges turned into #changes the moment they increased original max pop of servers...
---
This fight reminds me of American politics and the "both sides" argument
---
Using the dps set (especially with hit) helps, or using 1h dual wielding.
---
I’m one of those people that doesn’t look up rotation guides. If I wanted to play like a robot and do exactly what a website tells me to do I wouldn’t be playing this game.
---
&gt;*· · · Bleep bloop, I'm a bot. Comment requested by* u/Furydrone
---
Do yuw dink g-gawd stays in h-heaven because he two wives in feaw of hiws own c-cweations?
---
if the game is so easy, why bother getting any upgrades at all though ;)
---
If a hunter wins that item against a rogue/warr in phase 1, it's still the best item the hunter could get, so it's fair game. Sure it sucks for a rogue/warrior that a hunter gets it over them. In a guild group I'd want the hunter to get it after, but in a pug it's fair game for the hunter. You can't expect someone to not try to attain their best item, because it's "better for you".
---
....

Windfury wrecks in group PVP.
---
Stack your shammy with your warrior and rogue and absolutely delete people.
---
Also tremor totem for fears, earthbind for slow, cleansing totems, etc....
---
Ele shaman is very bursty, good AoE, and off heals.
---
Granted the pally+druid combo for FC in WSG is OP as fuck, but that loses its main value in AB/AV. Shamans will always be incredibly useful because of the very wide toolkit they have. Next to druid they have the most flexibility.
---
I think it's pointless to argue about which racials are better, but Alliance will clearly have a large advantage when it comes to queue times. They'll be popping much quicker than Horde simply due to the population imbalance. If you wanna grind honor as fast as possible, WSG Alliance side is the easiest way.
---
Yeah you lost this big time bro. Your weak ‘k’ just reinforces that. Loooooser
---
She's got sass for sure.

Generalizing is a fallacy because you’re not getting to the root of the problem you’re just trying to find a justification for getting ganked by offering red herrings as causes.  It’s PvP bro.
---
Did you look into r1 renew healing output? Scaling of spells learned at &lt;20 is lowered if I'm not mistaken. Rank 3 (learnt at lvl 20) is actually a quite potent raidtopper, giving &gt;800 health for &lt;100 mana.
---
Dunno about Classic but in vanilla you would either port but arrive dead at the inn or if the game can't decide between death or port it breaks the tie by sending you to Westfall dead, in which case you have to take your ghost back to where you were killed which would be pre bubble and not at the inn.
---
This happened all the time in old SS vs TM slideshow battles where the lag meant a massive version of batching.
---
What's the best addon for tracking time on dots, banishes, etc.? As a warlock I use necrosis, but over the time I fond myself disable more and more of its feature, but I can disable it entirely because I'm still heavily dependent on this functionality.
---
&gt;Were People banned or punished for this in vanilla?
---
I don't know, I began playing in TBC.
---
I seen many popular streamers doing it during the beta and nothing was done about it. I'm concerned same thing will happen on live.
---
If you want to PVP, roll a PVP server. If you would cry on reddit after getting ganked, roll a PVE server.
---
Kinda does matter, should be using swords and like you mentioned, edgemasters. Anyone trying to main tank as a cow without them is going hinder their guilds progression.
---
That is a good question. Basically there is no reason to atm.
---
I and most people I presume get their bis items because they enjoy the game and like working towards a goal.
---
And if you rolled on a PvP server because your veteran wow friends chose that server and everyone on reddit is saying that you're not really playing the game if you don't play on a PvP realm then I guess that's on you too then for not knowing that everyone else was wrong.
---
Alright any rogue pros here?  
---
I'm a 60 rogue atm. I don't know whether to go swords or dagger (I'm an undead). I'm in a guild who clears mc/ony in 2 hours, and there's no problem with the raiding, just can't decide.   
---
How does the endgame p5/p6 swords stand up to the daggers? What's best in pvp/pve?  
---
I like the idea of having coldblood, but also like the idea of having big ambush crits.. how do they compare to eachother in the different phases? like phase 2 to 6. Please!  
---
This guy clearly doesn’t worldbuff
---
Bigger than...
---
I do just fine. I know the game. I'm making fun of elitists in 5 man pugs. Stay on topic.
---
What will happen in servers there ally is 20%. Horde will be in queue?
---
Zug zuging around
---
They hid my last post without any notice. 
---
I guess since the majority of the sub is horde and gets butthurt when they see anything that makes fun them, mods have to subtly censor posts to stop them from crying

To be honest on my server literally any time of the day feathermoon and its boat is camped by 3-5 people (also the other FP. Thalanaar maybe?), the road on both sides are camped by same amount of people, and DM entrance are camped by 2-3 zugzugs. We re heavily outnumbered, my guild is usually pvping in EP or badlands/SG (gotta swap up places cause if you stay in one place for long you get overswarmed).
---
If you think this is exaggeration i can upload a vid for ya.
---
Thanks for the input. 
---
To be honest, I just wanted someone's affirmation before pulling the trigger on it. 
---
Thanks to you, I've made up my decision.
---
There are alot of patrols in maraudon. If you return there, always be on the lookout for some elementals.
---
Doesn't only the party leader need to be?
---
Imagine that being the way you have to farm honor...
---
It literally adds 50 dmg to the next attack and doesnt scale with crit.
---
Earn the mount yourself.
---
Idk as a horde player on heartseeker I really doubt this. I know it's anecdotal, but, I hardly see horde online and all endgame zones are alliance dominated, unless we rally a wpvp group. Even then alliance will swarm shortly after and no horde are interested in groups larger than 5 so it's hard to hold a zone.
---
I was using thet spec.
---
Also, can you please awnser my original question? How is people transferring worse than people out right quiting?
---
Ideally you use t1 Head Gloves and bracers and boots + shoulders from the blue pvp set.  Going for other t1 pieces isn't really worth it compared to of frozen wrath greens
---
On earthshaker there's often multiple rogues in org. Yesterday 3 rogues camped between the portal spawn and flight master for a couple of hours. How about directing your anger at the people who made the shitty decision to not have BGs come out the same time.
---
It's a pretty even server, and alliance and horde take turns on controlling areas. Every sunday alliance control BRM during raid hours. Horde tend to hold EPL more, but alliance pretty much controls Felwood, and both sides camp the shit out of flight paths.
---
Do you want someone else to take an item that's a minor upgrade for them, but a huge upgrade for you? No? Then give them the same courtsey.
---
"How does PvP in WoW Classic differ from other games?" seems like a reasonable query if you care about PvP.
---
But it really seems like you're angry because you got what you asked for and it wasn't what you expected. I'm sorry that happened to you, but it's not a problem with the game.
---
finally! a more direct flight path
---
Fair enough about the Wowhead survey, but I'm still surprised to continue to see you use Firemaw as an example of a "horde dominated" server when there are far worse out there. 
---
57-43 isn't too bad, and saying there's X% more Horde than Alliance is relative. If there was 2 Horde and 1 Alliance then there would be 100% more Horde but in terms of actual numbers there would only be 1 more player. 
---
I'm fully aware that there's more Horde than Alliance on the server, but the server is in no way dominated by Horde. In all honesty I've noticed more Alliance dominance than anything, they're way more coordinated on our server than the Horde are. Walking to Dire Maul or BRM is a corpserun more often than not, the Horde are too lazy to group up and do anything about it! It's absolutely not one of those servers where Alliance players find themselves simply unable to play the game. Those are the truly "dominated" servers.
---
Hey, don't worry about it too much. If you are lvl59 going there with pretty much pre-raid bis teammates then you are there to be a pet lmao. Use your aoe, taunt. If they pull aggro, tell them you've done the most you could and list them their options:
---
1, either they should lower the DPS so you can hold aggro
---
2, or they can deal with taking aggro themselves, which they will find out whether they can kill the mob or mobs before they get to them or will die a few times and then get the hang of how to play around your tanking
---
If it's a healer pulling agro then idk what's happening anymore :D
---
It's really apparent when you look at what he is writing. He of course have a really good sense of what his Warlock can do and that is not surprising as hes playing one, but he's also showing ignorance towards what other classes can do to him in a team fight which will stop him dead in his tracks.
---
  To me it seems hes never really played against a proper premade Alliance group. Against uncoordinated groups you can get away with a lot.
---
Yeah, what I have heard from most is go the wildheart set.
---
I had this happen to me as well in retail, I was flying from Loch Modan to Stormwin. Mid flight before ironforge I entered a battleground, as soon as I got out I flewthrough mountains, I clicked dismount/stop at next point near ironforge and it glitched out and I appeared at the stormwin flightpoint after about 2 seconds.
---
was strange. Seeing it in classicshows its either an old bug or a server thing
---
We’ve been clearing Rag since Week 2, Week 3 with 2 raids and by Week 4 with 4 raids.
---
3 months or so in and we’ve seen 2 bindings drop in (2) different raid groups, nobody has a pair. Some groups just get lucky
---
Details! Should be able to tell you under the damage taken portion.   Click on yourself to see the details of the fight.
---
You need the gear.
---
BGs rep - yes, should be easier, especially if not losing all the time? Not ranking.
---
Unless you're in a hardcore guild don't worry about it, play how you want to. They are both comparable on horde side when played mostly right, less so for the alliance as the room for error doing the slam rotation is tight. Spreadsheet on the discord has DW several hundred dps higher then 2h for a horde, but it's not a perfect simulation.
---
I did not expect that ! Haha
---
OP talks about the rank 3 pvp discount, not the rep discount.
---
They will be ported back to Org every time they exit a battleground.
---
You seem to be saying that it is not normalized, and also that the dmg is added after crit has been calculated (something like that). I believe the last thing to be false, that the dmg will indeed be increased if the attack crits.
---
cuz there's like 2 servers that are pvp and alliance dominated...
---
The qualifications needed to be allowed on roller coasters?
---
Yeah, like i sayd, i'm not at home so i cant check the addons, only the website for raid logs.
---
You are missing out on all threat generation perks of prot - you will struggle unless you adapt your build. 
---
Yes, you can tank any dungeon as full arms, but you won't be a good one.
---
He's cheesed out of his mind!
---
Just this morning I logged in at 10am and took a gryphon to Duskwood because I thought that is one FP where I won't possibly be zerged down as soon as I land. I was wrong.
---
"Yeah, but all you have to do to get a better chest piece is quit your job and grind PvP ranks for the next two months."
---
--Braindead warrior players in this thread
---
Yeah, as Horde on Heartseeker I have trouble believing that one. I can't see any pop source that's not from September saying 50 50 still.
---
&gt;King’s Honor
---
/r/cringe
---
actually that's near 50:50  @ level 60 according to warcraft logs parse data.
---
I just don't believe that, anyone who actually has played for rank1 knows how aids it is, queue-dodging, snipers, counters, +1 / -30 rating games, 5-25min queues etc etc. Its not feasable to boost someone to rank 1, it just isn't.  Atleast not the way you are describing it. Since you are claiming that there were a couple of rogues selling rank 1 spots, which in by itself doesn't make much sense since only one team can have it. And its not as if people wouldnt contest your rating so just playing "bare minimum" of games is a really bad way to guarantee it.
---
Why I know is because I tried getting rank 1 in 2v2/3v3 in s2,s3, s4, s5, s6 and failed every time, been 2nd, 3rd several times but yea so I just have a hard time piecing that story together.
---
100% both ways. Lots of people chose the type of server they want to play on based on the experience on Vanilla servers. And, as far as i notice (ex. vanilla player), nothing is the same. The evolution of the game knowledge, information, skill etc. turned Classic into something that not resemble to the Vanilla many of us played.
---
So, i am for transfers both ways. We expected something, made a choice, discovered that our expectations were terribly wrong, give us a chance to correct that choice. Add also a 6-12 months CD to transfers (they bad it back then), not to be exploited, but let us chose right based on the updated situation.
---
You make him sound like the guild pet.
---
Its not mages that do best, its paladins, they can bubble and run away. Mages always die to buisers, they get spammed with nets and can only blink out of 1
---
Horde just strolls in to BRD with 0 deaths all the time. There's not a single spot along the path where you don't see 5 Horde players. I've never seen Alliance control BRM. The path from Kargath to SG is camped by Alliance rogues all the time, but _you don't have to go there_. Just fly directly to TP and you're good.
---
Wild Animals sometimes controls the MC entrance, but that's it. For any Alliance player if you're lucky and you have stealth it can take as little as 6 corpse runs. If you're a warrior then GL.
---
Over 130 different horde players are on my KoS  list. I got ganked about 20 times every level between 50 and 60, but I managed to keep going. Leveled in dungeons quite a lot. Rage quit a few times. But in the end, I am level 60. 
---
And I just got ganked again! Woo
---
Horde can say zoomer
---
Alliance get boomer
---
Triggered Alliance mod? :thinking:
---
You can't go higher in standing than rank 1, but that's about it
---
Yup
---
You mean the boom word and the zoom word?

Get some nature dmg gear and 2 shot everything
---
There's a lot of variables at play, most importantly how Blizzard sets up the battle groups. If groups are paired across both PVP and PVE there'll still be horde queues, but nothing unreasonable.
---
If PVP servers are their own group I expect *a lot* of whining here on reddit. From my understanding there's one US PVP server that's ally dominant. The "balanced" servers like Incendius and Benediction still lean 55-60% horde. The real kicker will be the completely lopsided servers like Skeram and Herod pushing horde queues over the top.
---
The absolute state of it
---
Int will only improve your Mana pool and slightly boost your spellcrit. You will need +sp, but more specifically, access to higher level talents. Extra crit damage, lower LB cast time, etc. Your damage will get better further down along the line, but it may be another 10ish levels or a bit more.
---
It's going to be more steady damage than Enh though, which fluctuates between wtf-1-hitting stuff and "OMG why won't this crap proc?!".
---
Must be nice to be able to do that.
---
I wish I did, that's what my entire post was all about... trying to somehow dig more info up.
---
Plot twist: You can also get there from Burning Steppes!
---
Got camped trying to get from Camp Mojache to DM last night, but it's part of the game. Stop complaining about Horde only, it's getting tiresome.
---
reported
---
Honestly, wolves. Orcs on kodos look weird, skeletal horse is kinda off-putting. Raptor riding looks amazing though, and fits hunters quite well imo. So if you want another races mount, I'd go raptor
---
I take the "No" route every time.  Every now and then, players will just let me ride past... and then help kill me once they see another player start attacking.
---
I have some great screenshots of the Horde from Kirtonos, and their efforts to make my life miserable.
---
If you were OT for a guild and they replaced you, sounds like you’re not very good
---
On Razorgore EU, there was a Priest who spent days camping this quest and anytime a Horde ran in to try to do it, he would just dispell their disguise.
---
Literally tried multiple times over multiple days to get it done and the onyl way I could do it in the end was by calling in some guidlies to kill him before I went in and grabbed the Q.
---
These assholes unfortunately exist.  I dont get it either, but they do.
---
Are the other realms really that much worse? The only PvP I see on Dreadmist is 2 certain guilds sitting in stealth on popular paths (path to DM &amp; BRM specifically) with 3+ people and ganking them it's 3v1 or 3v2. I've only had a handful of 1v1s or equal battles since P2.
---
Not saying the Horde is any better, pretty sure we camp a lot of places with overwhelming numbers.
---
Thank you for the feedback everyone
---
The way I see it:
---
Swords: Kill someone with stunlock in 20 seconds, pretty much regardless of hp
---
Daggers: Finish off someone in 5 seconds or kill them from full health in 40
---
 
---
Idk tho
---
I am on Benediction (reasonable faction balance). I go to Lakeshire and run along the very edge of the burning steppes zone every time I travel alone.
---
Do you know what the requirement will be for this wolf? Looking at (very old) wowhead posts on it, it looks like they changed around the requirements a bunch of times regard gold, reputation and AV marks.
---
I’m about to do my bene quest, what’s the addon for the health bars with spell icon on it. I have neat plates but I cannot figure it out
---
It's  much harder to bubble hearth as horde.
---
lol
---
&gt; Attacked me for no reason
---
Last time I checked we were in a state of war. Congrats to 60!
---
Its strange, I mean, there are snapshots and a lot of them are available to jump between, but its as if everything past 2008 (even if snapshots exist) just re-direct to some error-message, feels as if someone who knows more about this could probably figure it out. would be fun to find me and my friends arena teams.
---
Come on man you should fight them. That seems like a fair fight
---
It's worth it to use the rank 7 boots and rank 7 gloves for the 2-piece bonus until you can get rank 10 shoulders. Ideally you'll wanna have T1 Helm, Bracers, Gloves, and Boots, right?
---
But where do you draw the line? Do you google that for every bit of game element? Is "How does mining in WoW Classic differ from other games?" a reasonable Google search?
---
You come in with some idea of how a game element works and if it works just as you expect it does, why would you seek more information on the subject? If you come in with some preconception that is wrong, you will eventually figure that out, when game outcomes don't match your expectations. Then you know that the information you had on the subject was wrong and you go and try to find the correct information.
---
The issue players are having is not that the pvp is not like they expected it to be, its that they found out it wasn't when phase 2 rolled out instead of when they first entered the contested zones.
---
I honestly wonder if BGs are going to solve this problem as many people seem to think.  I remember back in vanilla, if you joined BGs without a premade group, you are going to get rolled, and you quickly learned it was pointless.  And premades would skip fighting other premades.  I think this may result in BGs not being optimal for honor, and the honor grinders will eventually return to world pvp.
---
Based off my own tests i haven't seen it increase damage on crits.  I could be wrong of course.  So i use a wind serpent as a pet and have been doing more dmg with that and dont have to worry about sending it into melee range
---
PvP wise, it's alliance dominated. I play there.
---
Correct, this is not for Classic.
---
I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM.
---
Idk Lvl 28 was when I started doing a lot of damage. I basically would LB x 2 which would often bring them down to 50% and then lightning shield, searing totem, and melee with 1h and shield. I had +7 nature damage from the wailing caverns set bonus and then standard int/stam/spirit gear.
---
tHe MeLoDy Of ThE bLaDe

It's MC and Ony, not mythic azshara..
---
Honestly, I've been ganked by more squads of horde kill squad than I've seen of alliance kill squads.
---
Exalted rep and like 600 gold or something. Using marks to buy stuff is a TBC thing.
---
The numbers of upvotes compared to the number of people subscribed is always super low on every sub. When on top of that the sub is 60-70% less active than two months ago, you can also consider that the number and ratio of upvotes is quite revealing about the general feeling. 
---
More over, it's known that the people on this sub is more engaged in the game and play more than the average player who just play and in your opinion, who is having the more fun in this phase: the "hardcore" players or the 'casuals'?
---
Then negative bias is really an easy way to dismiss any complain. I mean why a community so positive about the game fall into negativity just because of a "overwhelmed minority" suddenly? why Blizzard releasing BG so fast if phase 2 is a success? Why is the large majority of player having so much fun right now not complaining about the release of BG? I mean with negative bias, we should have daily complains about how this vocal minority is spoiling the fun but apparently not a lot of people are really sad about the end of this phase 2.
---
The idea that this is only horde is stupid as fuck.
---
Ah, you paid for the 'direct flight'. :P
---
Endorsed. As long as you understand you're handicapping yourself, and you're willing to accept that and work through it, go for it. Just don't impose it on others by trying to tank PUGs as a level 36 DW Fury warrior. Get a guild or a group of friends who are cool with it. It'll be a bonding experience!
---
My experience playing Alliance in Phase 2:
---
Monday - Don't log in
---
Tuesday - Don't log in
---
Wednesday - Don't log in
---
Thursday - Don't log in
---
Friday - Don't log in
---
Saturday - Put together a DMT group. Stealth to entrance. Wait 45 minutes for your warrior to get close to the door before he gives up and logs out. Log out.
---
Sunday - Log in, 40 man fly to MC. Jump off the ramp to hit the load zone. Log off after MC/Ony.
---
yeyeyw and so was the car too huh?
---
doesn't matter, there's 3x as many PvP servers, and PvE server players are gonna be less likely to queue for bgs overall anyway
---
"roll on a PVE server" smh, easy to say you boat camping piece of shit
---
Or if you are in the top bracket I guess? Do you get more rank points for being R1 vs R5 for example?
---
Just play like an enh shaman.  Cast lbs to pull.

Oh no I didn't even get to OT 😂 I Joined to be an OT then instantly I could see tank spots filled on the roster.

Coming back after listening to almost half of the podcast and I must say "good job!". Due to the length it's more a podcast than a guide, but that thought process about all the matchups, builds, situations, etc. is what I need to hear. Because it makes people realize why you do stuff that you are doing.

Why are you in fire resist gear?
---
Just happened to me on Earthfury. 
---
Camped at thorium point, flight master dead.

Log off for the night, can't be bothered.

Get killed by a rogue in org.

CRINGE
---
What in the actual hell are you rambling about.?
---
Do it. I've been having a blast doing it in classic.
---
I Leveled as ele shaman and it was a lot of fun. Just stack Int and Stam gear. Look for "of the eagle" upgrades on the AH or drops.  Once you get to level 45-50 you can look for +spell power gear. 
---
keep rockbiter on your weapon, and drop your searing totem on each fight too. Basically open with LB, and try to get a flame shock or Frost shock off between the next LB (what ever one does the most damage).  You need to get a good weapon, and a shield, as you only get 2-3 shots off before meleeing down a target.  Having a good shield does wonders for your health. 
---
Good thing about leveling Ele, is you can heal any instance with ease, as you have a large mana pool.
---
Daggers is a more fun playstyle. That is a scientific, objective, and irrefutable fact. :)
---
I may not remember this 100% or I may be mixing pserver rules in a bit. But the way I remember it was yes it was bannable. Specifically the jumps that allow you the break through the gates before the match begins and the jumps that allow access to parts of the map that should obviously not be accessible were bannable. BUT the catch was that back then it took GM's a couple hours to get back to you and investigate. So unless this griefer is literally doing this all day or the GM happens to investigate at the beginning of a match. There's not much they would do. I think it's possible they would only get a verbal warning if they were caught in action anyway so this behavior was a little hard to crack down on.
---
Perhaps with all the recording and streaming this will be a different story these days. But if pserver staff could block the major game breaking jumps, surely blizzard can too, right??
---
Like half the top posts arent Ally whining about PvP, racials, imbalances, leveling
---
Boo hiss
---
&gt; Some people actually prefer to play blind and get their experience ruined
---
So it's willful ignorance. Guess what, it goes the other way too - you ruin their experience with your ignorance too.
---
I don't expect much on pub groups, but sorry to break it to you: Most people don't want to put up with your shit and that's their right. If you are too lazy to educate yourself, you have only yourself to blame if people don't want to play with you.
---
Whining on reddit is pretty pathetic too
---
but how's the endgame aspect of daggers? at phase 5-6? is the daggers dps better than swords/better in pvp?
---
Jesus I just realized how boring this game is ...guess I’ll go outside now
---
Mate have you not seen the hundreds of posts about alliance crying over pvp? As soon as a horde player says the same they get downvoted
---
As a horde on this server i can ralate to this post,i was reading it and felt like my situation...so this post is a bullshit its same shit on both sides
---
Considering your gear level for fast MCs and assuming you are fury prot you should be able to 2-man DME jump runs and make good money.  Especially easy if Horde and can easymode it with a shaman but I have also done it with a priest.
---
Windseeker!
---
With the new horde backdoor found on pservers and no mines I expect horde to be favored in AV zergs
---
Tell me one Alliance dominated server. I mean really population wise dominated. I will wait. Thanks.
---
Why do you want cht over perdition?
---
Oof. I'm usually around 18-20k per at lvl 38. But I good off and PvP a lot
---
Westfall is very similar as well.
---
Getting bis isnt tryharding.
---
Your analysis was personal anecdote
---
The ignore feature is great for avoiding these people in the future at least
---
Specifically about pvp, its assumed everyone knows whats up because if you've watched even a small amount of videos leading up the classic, all these things were talked about endlessly. Same for pre raid BiS. This info is not exactly hidden, and everyone expects everyone capable of playing online games to be able to use google.
---
I don't care if ppl don't know a thing or two, but it is safe to assume they do, cause 90% of classic players do.
---
I heard it's better to make the switch from enh to elem at 40, but idk I made all the way in enh.
---
Don't act like these actions are going only one way, there isn't a horde city in the world where I'm not at risk at getting ganked out of the blue. I'm aware it's an unpopulair opinion, but I feel this is happening more after the spy change.
---
Yeah horde.. Didn't realise there was such a difference but I guess it makes sense.
---
On an unrelated note, I think I saw your corpse just south of kargath yesterday! I hope you weren't ganked too hard!
---

I can't dot up the adds, I have an assigned curse and we don't waste debuff slots on 3-4 corruptions/immolates. Another lock has corruption duty.
---
keep telling yourself that sweet lie.... wow
---
Watch out for Purity's 15 raids teams mate
---
Its that the server has gone from 90% ally to 54%.  Its on its way to being another horde dominated server (which puts every NA pvp server in horde control).
---
There is very much a reason it is a thing.
---
Some mates and I murdered this skull level guy in Westfall on our alts. 
---
He got a couple of us down each time but we prevailed. It was super fun.
---
xpoff.com is a wealth of twink information which you may find useful
---
That’s why dude was immediately trying to cast his heal. He knew...
---
I'm a mage I can't heal mate lol
---
i know im using it myself incombo with catseye elixer :) there is no stealther i cant see, but with my sap macro you dont stand a chance.. also i dont attack from the front
---
thing is, if 5 folk report you, you could get a ban instantly anyway with the new easy reporting in classic.
---
Take your own advice and earn the mount for yourself instead of relying on others. "Worry about yourself".
---
I’m sorry, what? Are you level 60? When do you fly to WP or EP and see a group of 10 alliance camping flight path? How many alliance rogues you hear people saying are killing in your main cities? How many times can you waltz into dire maul without a group of alliance ( 15+ ) standing on top of the stairs? The numbers do not lie.. and you don’t have whole guilds moving to other servers...
---
nevermind dude, this guy just keeps beating around the bush and can't backup a single one of his edgelord one liner memes
---
For me it's basically a revenge list. I.e. if I see someone red in distance, I may not spend 5 mins chasing if we both have fast mounts. But if I see someone from my KoS list in distance, you bet I will try to cut his path and catch the guy somewhere :D
---
Just get the Emperor neck bro...
---
No, it’s not. A random pick up game requires no money investment, is short in time, and likely very casual. That more like grouping up for a random quest out in the world. No running dungeons or raids at end game.
---
At the end of the day if you are completely ignorant to the mechanics of WoW you are going to be ignored/piss off  the good players. You are putting a moral judgement on those good players who do not want to play with willfully ignorant players, which is bullshit.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Resto shaman here. Can say the set bonus is straight fire my dude. If the other shamans are spreading healing way with you, it out performs chain heal by a huge margin. Take a look at warcraft logs top shaman. Most are running 5pc and several are running 8pc.
---
But why do you need to inform yourself? Either the information is available ingame or you have to use third parties which frankly should not be required.
---
Just ally side has this btw
---
That is why I need on barb blade for PvP as a deep prot war

Guys from Blizzard, if you read this, I'm up for employment.
---
Same for me. It has been mostly a pleasant journey, im lvl 44 now. Most enemies just ignore me, probarly cause im not 48. Some have tried to kill gank, some succeeded, others not. Having the spy add really helps as i tend to zone out sometimes when im killing stuff. Really only had one really bad experience where i was killed and camped by a trio, but whatever, i just read some wiki and ressurected after 10 min or so. I dont really get mad for getting killed, i have just accepted that this is how it is. If it gets too bad (Badlands), ill just find somewhere else to level or jump in a dungeon.
---
Fuck-a yu mountain!!!
---
I actually got the T1 gloves already. The reason I am using the [legs](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16796/arcanist-leggings) over the [gloves](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16801/arcanist-gloves) is the 1% crit over the 4 mp5 and the SPdmg difference. Should I equip the gloves as I already got Skyshroud Leggings.
---
The pvp shoulders comes from rank 10 and I don't think I will be hitting that anytime soon. Currently only honor rank 3.
---
Current behavior on Benediction is nothing like my experience in Vanilla. 
---
People saying that one should have known world PvP would change questing in the 51-55 range like this are simply incorrect.
---
I think it is most likely that the people criticizing complaints are also the people creating the complaints.
---
5/8 t1 and 3/8 t2 until 8/9 t3 is just silly to not use.
---
I think the main thing you pointed out is that rogue gets their speed ability a full 10-12 levels before the others, making them the clear winner.
---
The overall proc from t2 is closer to a 40% chance. The formula is 1 - 0.9^5 = 0.41
---
Bruh let the man play the game how he wants
---
&gt;and make 100 times more honor, I don’t get it
---
You don't get it because you don't understand that the actual honor is meaningless, it's the amount of honor RELATIVE to the other people in your faction that matters to rank.
---
&gt; we are just trying to quest, enjoy the game, with the little time we have.
---
why not play on  a pve server in the first place
---
No they do not, but lhw r4 has insane throughput when mana surge refunds
---
My res sickness getting completely consumed between a ress at TP for repair and returning to brd says otherwise , it's all anecdotal evidence based on the time you were there . That's why I said in my experience because i've seen both horde and alliance controlling the mountain entrance in these 2 weeks
---
Just as a counter point, games are for fun and just because you CAN but research and learn a lot about a game, doesn't mean you HAVE to.  Some people play this a few hours a week max because they're real life is so busy.  Imagine going on a dungeon run with that few hours and being told off by someone who spends 5 hours a day on WoW, for not knowing where to go, the mechanics of the bosses, or what items you should roll on.
---
It's all perspective.  WoW isn't everyone's main hobby, and many people have busy lives outside of it.
---
Is there somewhere else in IF to set it?
---
Mak'gora
---
Leave my bracers and boots out of this argument.
---
Not too late to reroll too. Trust me, if you like the game (but not the current experience of PVP Servers), you'll be waaay happier on a PVE Server.
---
BGs will not solve this. They didn't solve it on any of the PVP Private Servers I played on; Horde or Alliance both had roaming gank squads (usually lvl 50+).
---
And no, it's not the server capacity. On those Private Servers I played, the 'red is dead' mentality was pretty extreme. - It reminded me of Darkfall (full loot PVP MMO). It didn't matter if you were a challenge. If you could be attacked, you were.
---
...that mentality has carried over into Classic. I don't know why. Maybe people think of all these PVP Videos from days gone by, and want to recreate them. Maybe they're just bitter adults and want to take their frustrations from RL out on people in a virtual world. Who knows.
---
*omg git good*
---
*roll PvE*
---
*why you roll PvP if you no like PvP*
---
Arcanite reaper
---
It was Rebekah vardy's account
---
6 deaths going to DM a few days ago, with 4 different squads ganking there (and I didn't even go on the road, which makes me extra salty about that one). Strat I can usually do in 3-4 deaths, depending on who controls LHC (though that seems to be the Alliance usually). 
---
BRM is generally a 4+ death ordeal for me if I go via Kargath. Always a couple of rogues in the chokepoint towards Searing Gorge and at least 1 group on the way to BRM. Inside BRM is a coin toss depending which side decided to park a 10+ man raid there.
---
I just stopped playing as much as I did in P1, but I guess that's also because all there's really left for me atm are raids. Really looking forward to those BGs.
---
I wouldn't be crying. But i wouldn't say its "pvp on a pvp server". Its not a us vs them problem. Its about server balance.
---
I wanted Alliance. My friends wanted Horde. I was out numbered.
---
Im a newbie myself which im pretty upfront about, if it becomes a problem and i need to be lectured. But what i find most annoying is people that make obvious mistakes time after time; that are not open to advice by others (dungeon runs). It amazes me how some people can cause wipe after wipe without taking a hint nor realizing that they are doing something wrong. Also some of these minmaxers are the worst; just because its theoretically possible doesnt mean you can do it, obviously since my gear is red after x times in the spirit world.
---
Because it's different.  
---
Horde continue to say that people on both sides are the same, but if you check this sub - people are telling "I want to PvP so I rolled Horde".  
---
So more aggressive players join one side from the beginning.
---
I never said that Paladins = "alliance wins every time".
---
you assume those that gank now will stop because of BG's?  I swear some of you people
---
Oh daaamn. Didnt notice the horde dude waiting for him in IF until after your comment. I thought maybe he died to dots or something.
---
Pfffff
---
this was posted earlier and you just reposted it gj
---
"There are many players that have never played WoW before, never played Vanilla and never looked up guides online"
---
Is there really though?
---
Your enchants should be crusader or lifestealing main hand and 15 agility offhand.
---
Also, figure out of you want to backstab or sinister strike (with the lack of talents I'd suggest SS), then go for the main hand weapon that matches.
---
I would suggest cruel barb main hand, and either a good fast dagger in the offhand or another cruel barb for the +attack power.
---
Like you just did? Shut the fuck with this Horde v Alliance bullshit both factions got sweat neckbeard corpse campers, ninjas. Ya'll act like fucking 12 year olds some times.
---
Ok Boomer
---
Fun fact, there's more people new to Classic who don't know everything about it than there are Veterans of vanilla and private servers.
---
recent rerolls wouldn't be 60 yet, give it a month or so and it should be more noticeable
---
&gt; yes, at the age of 4 doesnt count. 
---
Ahh, why simply answer a question when you can be a condescending prick. Good old reddit.
---
Wow. Must be nice to use an inn in a capital city.
---
I can imagine.
---
You deserve it for bubblehearthing.
---
Deserved for bubble-hearthing.
---
The late 50's/60 dungeons were where I went from 'tanking' as 2h Arms to Prot permanently. The survivability and threat gen from abilities/talents became more valuable than my DPS as arms.
---
And on a general note, tanking became a lot less stressful for me when I got out of the mindset of "I have to hold aggro on 100% of the mobs 100% of the time" and got into a "as long as I keep key mobs on me things are fine" mindset instead. 
---
My experience has been that enough time in Classic has elapsed that people have remembered that warriors aren't aoe threat generators like they are in retail, and as such have lowered their expectations to reasonable levels.
---
How is the Horde the one being made fun of in this post? It's literally a Gnome getting one-shot after talking shit.
---
Fukken yeeted
---
*y u roll PvP if you no like PvP*

The only time for me where it becomes a big problem is when people are not allowing me to travel to my destination. Talking about things like camping and killing the flight master, like yesterday when Horde were camping the boat from Menethil &lt;-&gt; Theramore. Really does become sort of unplayable at that point.
---
Yes placement 1 gets 13k RP while #2 gets anywhere between 12000-12999 depending on how many other people are in bracket 14.
---
The problem with raiding with a wolf or cat is them dying all the time.   I use a wind serpent and didn't teach it bite,  but put more TP is survivability (FR, stam, armor).  I then just macro lightning breath to be cast with aim shot and multi shot.  So every time he has 50 focus he runs up, casts it from max range, and runs back.   It can be resisted but can also crit for 300 to 375 dmg.  Once ZG is released it'll get the rank of lightning breath and do more damage.
---
I only report them when they yell “you are an evil Korean” or if they curse in the slightest. Gotta reprimand the edgelords
---
Admittedly we did get a little carried away when the match up discussions started, but there's quite a bit to go over in Classic if you're trying to be inclusive for both beginners and advanced players. I'm not sure you could realistically condense all of the information down to something digestible to both skill levels of players.
---
i mean we all forget random things about the game but smelting ?
---
Getting BiS is something to do after or while you level. It's kind of the only reason to do dungeons later on.  
---
Besides stuff like the need of an alch lab, Dark Iron and so on
---
On skeram, there isn't a safe path in the zone for the alliance
---
BGs are out sometime next week, thank fuck.
---
&gt; If it's a healer pulling agro then idk what's happening anymore :D 
---
this mostly happens when you are getting to much damage and the healer has to heal you too much
---
as a dw fury tank i know what i am talking :P try to switch in more defensive gear
---
Here’s the Discord if you wanted to take a look around Bud. The PvP resource channel has some pretty good Information posted in it. Including this video. 
---
https://discord.gg/4gKf7r3
---
Ok so with your logic. The robe isnt either a worthy achievement since theres an equal amount of guides to get 1-300 tailoring as there are to anything else. 
---
This also means, theres no prestige in designing a new car, because cars have been around for so long.  
---
And theres no achievement in doing your first slam-dunk because Jordan did so many of them already.  
---
Nothing is worth doing because so much has been done before you.  You sound like a highschool shooter with your attitude.
---
Now fuck off.
---
&gt; why and how are horde camping Ironforge?
---
Because Alliance can't exit capitals without been killed. So Horde need to find new ways to farm honor and already invading Alliance capitals.
---
Yeah, fuck me for wanting everyone to get geared more easily. What a douche move.
---
Chad, install trinketMenu please!

I’ve been wondering about gear recently.  I’m 45 right now and still enh with the usual SM gear and ravager, but I know I want to switch to ele soon.  Should I be in the lookout for leather/mail int gear from dungeons/AH, or am I destined for cloth gear?
---
I think for either class, after you get a few more levels you can put yourself in more dangerous situations and that breaks up the monotony.  At least that's the way it is with locks.  Once you get more of your tools (fear, banish, death coil, various curses (e.g., recklessness)) you have a lot of options and utility, so getting into difficult situations and juggling mobs becomes more interesting.  Both mage and warlock have great feature sets with some tools that are often overlooked.  I think the trick is to try to block out all the information about 'the right/most efficient way to play' and experiment.  Either class should be able to solo most content, and both are welcome in dungeons.
---
Priests and Shamans,
---
But it’s not easy, you can buff the flag carrier with useless buffs like underwater breathing, rank 1 amplify/dampen magic, and all kinds of stuff.
---
I remember this. Cool flavour though.
---
Yeah, I got jumped by a group of 7 in WPL yesterday and 2 of them spit on me.  I'm sorry, I don't know what I did wrong, not supply enough honor points?  Try 1v1, you get more.
---
Who is insulting who man?
---
Good point, I hope the guy isn't wearing his dps set for tanking
---
Are there any alliance heavy pvp servers? or even a good 50/50 one?
---
It shares a CD with Dark Rune. So this isn't useful in raids, but maybe in WPVP for when you don't want to use dark runes?
---
I like lifestealing main hand and 15 agility offhand.
---
Why bother fireballing him when you can pyroblast his ass?
---
Oh yes, playing a recreational soccer game with random people and playing a recreational video game with random people are two completely different things, sure.
---
Dude, Classic isnt that serious, especially the PVE aspect. You cant compare it with playing in a sports league.
---
&gt;I honestly wonder if BGs are going to solve this problem as many people seem to think  
---
It won't. It may even make thing worse, because Alliance PvP players will now live in BGs, instead of killing Horde in wPvP. And Horde with longer BG queues will still be roaming around.
---
Yeah I thought that's the best part, but I can't decide what the abilities are going to be. I've never played Rogue before, so my idea was to go in stealth, click ambush and backstab and people die. I guess I was a bit wrong.  Cruel Barbs sound really good imo
---
Why do people have such a hard time with the idea that a game is something I do to have fun.  Getting to the end of the fun faster isn't better.  Figuring out what works is part of the fun for me.  Reading about what other people have figured out is a fun-destroying activity.  I will do it sometimes, but this culture of being critical of anyone who learns how to play the game by playing the game and not by watching other people play or reading guides is disturbing to me.
---
well yeah thats what I mean. As long as you are in a casual guild it doesnt matter but its definitely much worse than 2h fury.
---
Yeah i get the logic behind why It isnt being sold, but i still second guess it. When i Googled It earlier I read a post by a guy who bought it an respecced for it. He wrote he was able to take down big packs of mobs at the same time, and that he rarely wiped in instances afterwards. The shield itself might not be such an improvement but if you're considering doing a respec and change your style It's a must have for the level. If I level a warr in the future I'm gonna buy It for sure. I also like the idea of showing up to Scarlet Monestray mid 30, protection specced and with an epic shield. Thats badass.
---
I'm guessing it's the art/architecture the elves made themselves
---
Priceless &lt;3
---
I had no idea what they were worth when they dropped for me. Ended up getting my epic mount that day.
---
Somewhere instead of everywhere.
---
I mean basically that..  
---
It's been out for 15 years, people have been playing Private servers for ages, and there is infinite amounts of information available online.  
---
So yea a lot of people are going to expect people to research this stuff before hand.  
---
it is kind of like raiding, people expect you to study up on the bosses before showing up to raid.  
---
I totally get wanting to go in "Blind" and experience the game that way, but you have to also understand that you will likely run into those people who are assholes or don't have the patience... kind of the nature of planing a "Massively Multiplayer Online Game". Just like real like you can't control how other people want to play or how they will act.
---
Or you do it because fuck the opposite faction, maybe don’t give us a reason to report you?
---
&gt; Why do you never see clips like this on Alliance dominated servers posted by the local Horde players?
---
Because there’s already enough whine from Alliance on /classicwow. We Horde just complain endless in Guildchat or /1.
---
For holy reck, you want a slow 2h weapon, to maximize the effect of reckoning procs. Demonshear, Hammer of the titans or Arcanite Reaper are the top options outside of raids, after this unstoppable force from AV reputation or Zin'rokh from ZG. Next up would be Ashkandi or the R14 weapon followed by Dark Edge of Insanity and finally Ashbringer or Might of Menethil as the best weapons.
---
You must keep the 2h equipped, as reck stacks reset on weapon switch.
---
HolyReck is an allround build, but it shines primarily in pvp where it allows you to do massive burst, while being a strong combat healer. It's worse at grinding and sustained damage than a ret spec, worse at tanking than prot spec and worse at healing than holy spec. But it can do all aspects to some extent.
---
Regarding your 4 free points, well yes, you got what I like to call the holy/reck base build. Those 4 points are free and you can put them into whatever you like
---
* imp bow - nice for pve, but shouldn't be needed when you have sanc
---
* unyielding faith for disorient/fear resist - generally chosen
---
* divine strength or imp SoR - for more dmg
---
* shieldspec and imp. fury - for tanking
---
* imp conc aura - for spell pushback and silence protection
---
* blessing: generally bok or bow
---
* seal: sor of course
---
* judgement: put crusader on the opponent before unleashing the reckbomb, that's around 100 extra dmg from the sor procs or just judge sor directly.
---
Sure, survival is a concern. For now though, I am trying to get a grip on the numbers, so I know what I stand to gain or lose from the different things I can choose.
---
Alliance are going to get stomped the second they have to fight 1:1. They're not used to it.
---
Easy to get carried away talking about the Master Class Brotha.
---
bruh moment  [https://gyazo.com/26348c5eb01e8b9aed9b22e8295dc556](https://gyazo.com/26348c5eb01e8b9aed9b22e8295dc556)
---
News flash: you aren’t “geared” while leveling up. Ever. But thanks for the info.
---
Pretty much this.  I get that it would suck to lose a rare bis drop in a pug to someone who didn't know any better.
---
But if it's that important to you, you should make sure that you're either running with people who know that or take 30 seconds and communicate those expectations to the group at the start of the run.
---
Maybe they will, maybe they won't.
---
The question is, if you gamble on the chance of blizzard increasing the supply, can you afford to be wrong?
---
I won't be taking that chance.
---
Not sure.  
---
If all Alliance PvP players will be in BGs because of instant queues - then who will fight with Horde in the wPvP?  
---
Less active players in the world -&gt; more ganking from Horde side.
---
Elemental really isn't bad damage, I leveled with it from 1-60. The only gripe is that LB takes a long time to cast. Are you sure you trained all your ranks and have the latest rank on your bar?
---
But it is true. You wont PvP on PvE servers outside of battlegrounds. I have played PvE all the time in WoW retail from BC to WoD. I only did like 2-3 city raids in all these years and that was the only PvP I have ever done. And this was more PvE to be honest.
---
Believing you could get actual battles in PvE is stupid.
---
Yeah i guess. For me that is part of the game, notably only if the server is around 50/50. Which can create some memorable raid clashes. Thou, abusing server power is just bad sport. Death squads is also just dumb. Send your best and fight me 1v1, there is no skills or whatever in getting steamrolled 4v1ing a 40ish holy priest..
---
Was going to say this too rofl. may we find another
---
True honor!
---
This is a horde player just trying to setup a new camping spot
---
I'm going to assume you were tanking with 60's?  If so the problem could be that they already have raid gear or at least pre-raid gear.  They're dealing a TON of damage, and they're not used to waiting since they're tough enough to take the hits and just don't care.
---
A few things you can do if they're willing to actually let you play tank and follow your instructions:
---
Get a Lvl 57+ or BOE Epic weapon.  Scholo quest line has a great blue that will last you a long time (Mirah's Song).
---
Get hit gear, even if it's leather.  1-2 pieces won't kill you if it helps you get hit capped.  You could farm The Unforgiven boss in Strat... he has 2 nice pieces, one of which is a +2 hit leather head, the other being plate with +def.  You can go back to plate once your threat issues are alleviated through higher AP and Weapon damage.  Hit rings/accessories are even better (Mara ring) because those pieces don't have armor anyway.
---
This is particularly relevant for the big packs in LBRS but probably applies many places: put a skull/X on casters in packs and let the party tank them.  Like seriously, don't even touch them except maybe to throw an interrupt but don't worry about it too much.  Focus on tanking all of melee mobs.  By the time they finish off the casters, you'll have decent agro on all the melee.  Armor doesn't help vs spells anyway.
---
People throw out the 2H-&gt;WW-&gt; start sundering but I always have better luck by going straight to defensive stance, demo shout, tab sunder.  It takes a couple of GCD's and a lot of rage to SS/WW and by then the DPS has lost patience and started in, and I always lose more mobs that way.
---
 I'm not personally a fan of 2h tanking.  If you're trying  to tank lvl 60 dungeons but you're not 60, your gear is probably bad and you really need that extra armor from a shield, particularly if you're tanking multiple melees.
---
Looks really nice. Lemme know if you find out
---
Yea it's different in that I'm FORCED to do even more pve content to have the best pvp gear. Which is worse.
---
Not org inn, but in front of bank. Yes, ally rogues camp in OG too.
---
 This is really neat, I’ll have to back Bc and check gjis
---
Always love seeing y'all qts in MTC:D
---
Priests are great in PvP but you are pretty squishyy at basically all gear levels. I don’t really recall that disc was even the most popular PvP spec. There were a few that went for power infusion depending on their playstyle but a lot of them used to do this sort of holy disc hybrid for PvP I think. Heavy disc didn’t become a thing until tbc.
---
Sold it for 15g last month. Happy it even sold.
---
As someone who mained a gnome warrior in vanilla, I definitely could take equally geared mages 1v1. Warriors hit hard.
---
Nice karma farm, literally posted yesterday
---
Well I still would go with "you", but we just won't agree here.
---
But paladins are so broken, can't counter them in any way shape or form, horde whines 24/7
---
On my main it was easy first 2 weeks of classic.   
---
i didnt even bother on my alt. I just won roll on head of onyxia instead. might be easier for you too.
---
They did make the best weapon ever available from the start though, Bonereaver’s Edge. And you’re completely right
---
Wow man good job you really showed him
---
Exploit = ban, this is clearly exploiting
---
This was enough to trigger you to reply to my comment?
---
That's a very good point.  I know for some classes at least, the BiS list is for one specific build/playstyle and there are better options if you do different talents.
---
For example, a Resto Druid's BiS list looks very different if they're doing improved regrowth spec vs if they're going moonglow. 
---
And some people get pretty salty if an improved regrowth druid rolls on something that isn't on the BiS list, even though every one I've seen seems to be tailored to moonglow spec.
---
Except alliance players on those realms are FAR LESS likely to be worried about queueing up BGs to rank. As a matter of fact, most of those PvE realms are LOADED with casual players just chilling out and leveling alts and taking their time to 60...and much less of a population at 60.
---
So if you think you’re NOT gonna get soul crushingly long queues for WSG, then you are floating down a river in Egypt!
---
Hope you like AV...A LOT...and even then it will die down after alliance hit exalted, they won’t sit in it all day like Horde would.
---
Is this Earthshaker EU?
---
Completely agree, but there's no legitimate way to balance the faction. If you offered a free transfer to horde players on an already horde dominated server, you'd have to be brain dead to transfer from your position of power.
---
You guys know 15agility is not in the game yet right?
---
This is another reason I need to experience the game from the alliance perspective. After playing horde for 15 years I feel like I’m betraying a part of myself. Alliance zones do seem more interesting for sure.
---
Juts dinged level 34 on my shaman and picked up  [Illusionary Rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7713). I already have  [Corpsemaker](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6687) but does the dps outweigh the stats?
---
Did you say? Thunderfury, blessed blade of the Windseeker?
---
It comes down to wasting other's time and being respectful of how long it takes to do things in Classic. If you don't think someone should educate themselves for 10 minutes outside the game on YouTube, and instead go into content not knowing wtf is going on and screw other people over, then you are part of the problem.
---
Yes!
---
You need the Opie addon.
---
It’s like you’re trying to avoid logic. Nobody is saying BGs will stop tanking entirely, but that it will *help* by giving those that do it to farm honor a different outlet.
---
Yes, which is why I was putting the statement in the thread as an advocate against dw while leveling.
---
This isn't standard anyways. The chances of you getting the item sold to a sniper is just too high.
---
If they were that impatient, I’m surprised you made it to Gizlock. He’s typically the last boss in the entire dungeon.
---
Well that’your oppinion and I very much dissagre (right back at ya). Plus, my kharma counter is going up so idk...
---
\&gt; a Hunter rolling on Savage Glad Chest because its mail and good gear is still bad because "The warrior would not replace it as soon as the Hunter would."
---
As a warrior, any warrior who says this can just sit and spin.  You roll on that Savage Glad Chest and you love it.   
---
 I'm so sick of (usually warriors) treating BIS lists as a license to roll other armor types and screw over people who can only roll that type.  Yes, I get it, when fed through the formulas and spreadsheets it proves that technically a mix of mail/leather produces tip-top DPS.  Fantastic.
---
\*\*Form your own group without a hunter in it (using the situation above) so that, if it drops, you can roll on it unchallenged.\*\*
---
I think it's a huge scum-bag move to group with classes who can ONLY roll on leather and then rolling off on  leather gear that's an upgrade for them, as a plate wearer, while just pointing to BIS lists as the justification.  I'm not saying you can't wear those items, just don't be a colossal jerk about it.  Those folks are choosing to min/max gear to the point they're wearing mail/leather as a plate class, \*\*they\*\* should be inconvenienced by it.
---
Yeah, we've had more ony heads than people who want them, and it's actually a decent ring for Lock compared to the "Ring of the Unicorn" I had before!
---
You left out go to retail.
---
30% aggro reduce on salvation was a typo too then, should've been 3% I'm sure
---
A rogue tanked the 3rd to last boss of Black Temple by stacking Agi gear to acquire 100% dodge.
---
C'est bien vrai ! J'ai eu le torse sur Drakki au 2ème try donc grosse chance !  
---
Du coup prochaine étape pour toi : Full T0.5 ! Bon courage.
---
Priest belt sucks and set bonus isn’t worth it at all. Get Whipvine Cord if you don’t already have it and use it until T2
---
\#nochanges
---
Why would Alliance players report it? If anything, Horde would want it buried, and Alliance would want it known that horde are camping everyone everywhere.
---
&gt;level 3SnottersquerraScore hidden · 6 minutes agoThere is no doubt in my mind that it will help this. Just running around ganking people is incredibly inefficient way to get honor compared to battlegrounds. You won't be safe in the world but it will at least be closer to the normal kind of worldpvp. Not just people riding blindlessly in groups and killing anything they see 24/7.ReplyGive AwardshareReportSav
---
Queue up in UC and fly to LHC for the 30 minute timer to pop
---
Yup. Begging for fast WSG matches to rank up and compete with other rankers, but alas Alliance caring about grinding WSG all day to make rank will be slim to none. It’s going to be hilarious
---
Theres just a warm spot in my heart for dual fiery barbs. 40 dmg is a lot at level 19 for instaproc.
---
When i tried this the adds respawned. Well i killed only 1 and then vanished, but that one respawned.
---
You can use the itemrack add-on to quickly switch between your raid set and PvP set. There's really no reason to compromise like that imo.
---
When even bubble+hearstone doesn't work, it's signs that something is really going wrong
---
Try 4k.
---
do you think the wpvp will clear up once bg's are out?
---
I kind of see it as brilliant game design, that content from 2004 puts people into such a tribalisric frenzy. Congrats vanilla Blizz, you knew how to make people hate the opposite faction. 
---
Meanwhile modern Blizz is shitting all over that by fucking up server balance and populations.
---
Well here is proof. If you still don't believe me ask Nithore on Sulfuras Horde to take a screenshot of his warrior on Agamaggan still.
---

Gladly will if can get it
---
Completely novel idea: they can just append your old server name to your current name. Make it like Remlek-BurningBlade. Doesn't kill the immersion of an mmo at all, not one bit. And it makes it even easier later if they just want to merge them all together too :)
---
So are mine now that you mention it, until you start downvoting. I do not care about these internet points. If we'll just agree to disagree I think we can end this discussion here, everyone said their opinion and I have an idea no one is changing their view or behavior to any greater extent.
---
I wouldn't say "got carried away", I highly appreciate all the brainstorming (especially since I'm in work and have the podcast on while working :D ).     
---
It definitely targets players who have mediocre (or greater) knowledge about warlocks and wanna know all the niche PVP stuff. That's a good thing, because there are plenty of beginner guides around the web.
---
You're bad and your comment is bad
---
All of the responses to your comment are from Horde players lmao
---
Well, from a pure efficiency perspective, he IS sort of a pet. Imp. WF totem is nice, but another class/spec would probably deal more damage. Wouldn't want to miss him, though.
---
Thanks again for the graph, it's awesome. Any chance you might do another version with various renew ranks? I am curious how they scale, even if their use is occasional.
---
And how does that effect you in any way that there is more to do . 
---
I never understood that from a casual players perspective.
---
I highly recommend 20/31/0 for MC and 17/31/3 for BWL regardless of your current hit% standing + a Cat with both bite and claw.
---
My logs for MC are around 450-500 DPS and my pet is doing about 10% of that for the boss-only logs, which compared to some other hunter's logs (esp. Wolves) is a most likely a much bigger difference then the added damage from furious howl. More so, as I was doing some research on wow logs on furious howl uptime, it is really low aswell at is has a short radius. So you either get the buff and do not attack with your pet which makes you lose a lot of pet dps, you stand near melee and are threatened by melee mechanics and let your pet attack, or the wolf attacks and buffs just the melee.

Yup. Good luck getting a WSG match. Hope you love AV until alliance get bored of AOE farming you on the bridge and stop queueing that too. You weren’t planning on ranking were you, because that’s gonna suck.
---
It's like the girl hitting a boy vs boy hitting a girl mentality
---
I agree, i left the best possible outcome for OP somewhere in a previous comment, to join a nice guild with helpful ppl. At least we can agree on that.
---
you could set it Thelsamar and take the FP for all of 70 seconds and then be in the great forge.
---
Seen two Furor's drop from Zevrim, a lot of class books from all the bosses, zero books from the dusty tome. Now, I'm not saying that you won't find one, but it definitely seems like killing bosses are your best chance of finding what you need.
---
That is commendable, good on him! Props for putting in an effort, hold on to that guy.
---
You know how to break out of seduce as any class? Make sure you hit a mob so you can't be cc'd. Works for poly too.
---
OH, yeah meant 5/5 in illumination, im 20 into holy, my bad.
---
I don't see a reason to lose holy shield for a crit on 2 min cd, and neither do other people that I talk with. It won't make or break the class. You'll still top healing charts im an Ony pug without a problem. 
---
There's no reason to downrank a 2min cd crit when you get the mana back either way. For me at least
---
The problem either way for a hybrid spec is that you will do a worse version of both specs. You can go 20/31 holy ret, but is losing all the prot spec worth it? You need really good items to be good in pvp as ret, so if you have them why not go full ret? While going 31 prot still gives you the ability to heal everything at 90% of a 31 hpaladin while tanking every dungeon there is. 
---
I'm new to wow and didn't plan on healing or doing dps or tanking, I don't really mind respeccing next week to full holy for bgs, and hey I'm rank 6 now maybe when I get rank 13 I might go full ret for fun!
---
I disagree soul link is always better as soon as you are being focused (which is gonne happen cuz warlocks don't have any mobility)  we are talking about actual PvP aka 2v2 3v3 4v4 etc and not standing there casting shadowbolt into a group
---
You think phase 3 and 4 will be 9 months each?
---
Dude, you need to learn how to read.

Their buildings like that are living things, that bear eagle could theoretically animate and defend Darnassus.
---
Do you need a key for that gate?
---
lol its a game, relax
---
Using a combo of both sets like that is not very benificial as you have weak +heal and average MP5. You should either use full 8/8 T1 for tank healing or 3/8 T2 with blues/epics stacked with MP5 and +heal to make your CH literally insane. Even just spamming Rank 1 will have you on top of healing charts.
---
It was pretty funny honestly
---
Choosing to ignore information that’s been available for years is just laziness. In the same way you are getting your game “ruined”, there’s a large amount of people who’s game gets “ruined” when someone can’t spend 10 minutes reading something or 30 seconds googling.
---
Aye, that does sound like very solid advice!
---
Horde: yes, and camping bloats, flight paths, and Wetlands.
---
To be fair, there comes a point in Vanilla gameplay where only logging on for raids is not too uncommon. If you have all your gear and enough gold, there's no real "reason" to log on otherwise.
---
And I think that's fine btw.
---
&gt; If you don't foresee that the enemy faction will kill you for honor on a PvP server, then I don't know what to tell you. 
---
There's a million different things you might not know to research about wow.  Maybe rolling a night elf warrior is crazy stupid.  Maybe warlocks are completely underpowered and everyone rolling them is dumb.  Maybe haircuts change dps.  Maybe if you roll on this server you'll be fine but that server will be a disaster.  I had no idea what I was getting into when I accepted a free transfer early in my WoW career but I trusted that Blizzard wouldn't screw over people renting the ability to play a game from them and would work to make sure that the game experience for everyone was reasonably fun because otherwise they'd stop playing.  I was wrong. 
---
I learned my lesson in Vanilla and rolled PvE this time because I knew that Blizzard would allow PvP to devolve into a complete mess and I didn't want to deal with their incompetence.  Expecting people to assume Blizzard is this bad at managing a PvP experience doesn't make sense.  They've been in this business a long time and should know better.
---
This was way before that
---
Alright, I feared as much. Guess I'll have to familiarize myself with WA after all! Thanks for your input.
---
Well, it doesn't hurt to try in that case. id rather have horde only transfers because right now the alliance are transferring from servers that are horde dominated making the problem even worse...
---
I only see one way to make this work and that is introducing queues for the dominant faction. But it would, of course, have a major backlash from the affected side.
---
Pour moi le plus long ça été le torse, j'ai du faire une quinzaine de fois UBRS avant de l'envoie tomber. Et je l'ai eu du premier coup.
---
Oui j'ai trop hâte mais la phase 5 c'est vraiment loin ! Je joue druide tank donc j'ai aucun mal a trouver des groupes pour faire les instances qui m'intéresse. Et surtout choisir avec qui je les fait. Je pense au strat baron 45 min. ;)
---
It’s still up. It’s like they forgot to actually remove it.
---
Don’t worry, listen to the smug sweaty neckbeard: “ackshully this is your fault for not knowing Blizzard would deliberately make concentration camp servers. Just get good, sounds like a community issue”
---
The game will not in any way die from this kind of idiotic bullshit...

Hey my dude. Bran flakes from &lt;Dude where’s my mount&gt; on Smolderweb here.
---
My guild has 3 high level warriors, one is prot, one is fury and I’m arms/prot. Plan is to offtank raids, tank dungeons and pvp all in one spec.
---
I have the same spec as you pretty much... arms, 5 fury, 13-15 prof right now maybe? haven’t had issues. I use Serathil/Lord Alexander’s battle axe and an axe spec’d. I’m also a gnome cause escape artist/pvp.
---
I crit all the time, which then bleeds everything and that’s how I keep aggro. Crit tanking. Obviously some enemies don’t bleed but there’s always sunder armor and such to keep those guys on me.
---
I’ll let you know how this fairs out as 60, but atm at 57 I can tank whatever and blow up 60s in PvP.
---
Feel free to pm me for a real id add!
---
dec 10 they're going to find out what it's like to not outnumber the other side 10 to 1. I'm expecting enough salt to cure every hide in the game.
---
A lot of this seems a bit flawed.
---
Hunters use poisons and a common counter to priests is to simply viper sting their mana away.
---
Blind is a poison from rogues, and theyre really easy to kite out by most classes if their crippling drops for a little while unless they pop cooldowns. A 3.5/5 minute cooldown for a cleanse seems like amazing value. 
---
That being said, poison cleansing totem is fantastic here, too. 
---
Devouring Plague is one of the most dominant early classes better nukes for undead and is a disease.
---
Paladins auras are largely better than resistance totems (as you can stomp totems and it can be very costly to reapply), and they have the added benefit of having a shadow protection aura.
---
BoP/BoF can totally be purged but the initial effect cannot be stopped. It will still remove that physical debuff or the frost nova, totally shut down that rogues opener or whatever - them lasting is purely added value.
---
In a PvP context holy shock is much better than renew. It seems very odd to me you talk about purging BoF and BoP but then say renew is better than holy shock, a burst uncounterable heal with the versatility to also have the potential to help shut down a major threat offensively.
---
Paladins do not win fights all alone but your criticisms seem plainly ignorant. Shaman are really really strong in their own way but there's a reason consensus is paladins are the most powerful organised PvP healers.
---
Where did you hear his brother played for him?
---
Mate you have no clue  like srsly

I used to buy gold from bc up until the end of wrath (also honorbuddy I bet you are also super sure that blizz is banning bots.. Oh my I have a surprise for you)

Guess who's  is not banned including everyone else that bought gold and used honorbuddy for mining
---
Just don't talk about a topic where you have no clue about
---
Yeah I do know that, but P3 is not that far away
---
No, you don't understand, unless it fixes 100% of the problem, it'll be useless!
---
The options are elementals,worms, imps? I think thats pretty much every non human mob in the dungeon.
---
It was early
---
My bad
---
I do like the nameplates style, what addon do you use for that?
---
I'm Tauren with Edgemasters. Currently I use Sword of Zeal MH and Trash blade OH and want to upgrade my OH. 
---
Now from your List I see that Trash Blade is superior in MH to Sword of Zeal, is that really right? And if so, why?
---
And which of the following OHs would you suggest: Mirahs Song, Serathil or should I keep Trash blade?
---
Or it's a honor trader being called out. I'd rather leave the server community to decide it, idk why people who aren't playing on Arugal should care.
---
\&gt;  was struggling to kill them off all by myself, then someone 20 levels higher than me comes and finishes me off. 
---
This is just bad form. 
---
People who do this should feel bad.  At least let your opponent drink/eat up.  1v1 WPVP should be a test of skill and comparison of gear.  This type of BS doesn't prove anything.
---
I legit pity people who derive pleasure from actively seeking to be assholes. Having spam macros is a strong indicator of this. You're trash.
---
If you want to see the past prices in private servers (just to get the indication where the prices will end up), check wow-auctionhouse.c
---
On my server, it's actually really safe for Ally because there is always a group of them camping the border of Searing Gorge to gank those entering from Kargath. The Horde tend to stay between BRM and Thorium Point, and I would even advise the Horde to fly from Kargath to TP, instead of trying to make it thru the gauntlet.
---
Getting killed over and over by gank squads doesn't make you "bad" at pvp, because it's a very imbalanced situation to begin with. On the few occasions when people tried ganking me 1v1 I usually win, but that doesn't mean I won't die 5 times in the next 15 minutes because packs of gankers are running around everywhere. 
---
Think people are confusing pvp with the pve farm style "pvp" we have now.
---
It’s so easy to mount away if you spend 10 seconds analyzing the farthest distance for rezzing and mounting. It’s a skill I never knew existed til watching these awful videos getting posted of people rezzing on top of their camper. Lmao. Frustrating to see so much badness.
---
Idk about that one. I havent checked recently but whitemane was fairly close to 50/50. I see a healthy balance of both factions doing wpvp.
---
Wow people do that? Don’t they have anything better to do? Well I guess that’s self explanatory...
---
Yeah these servers are dead one faction hellholes.
---
Fuck blizzard
---
Noggenfogger on gnome = literally untargetable
---
im a rogue and the fewest deaths ive done it in is 3 to get into UBRS
---
typically dead at FP (pick one it doesn't matter), dead again entering BRM (either side makes no difference). and then again someplace between the chain and UBRS.
---
if going to MC its normally a +1-2 from that and BRD is a +4 at least
---
Alliance dominates in pvp. Horde are generally more pve oriented and not interested in pvp. Its so hard to get a gank squad together. 
---
Alliance corpsecamps. Horde generally move on after one kill. (In my experience so far)
---
or at the actual portal. so I'm thinking AH/HFH area might still be a bit dicey.
---
Paladin is the only class who has Hearthstone bound to a key. I **always** click it from my inventory. For the past 15 years.
---
Some of them are bugged unfortunately :(
---
You sometimes cure the plant but can not retrieve the item or the buff. I guess it became available for other people or the timer is not ready yet.
---
It’s not pvp, it’s more like ppppppppppp v p
---
I think it will eventually, the majority are PvP'ing for honor points... once the BGs roll out they'll need to play that in order to rank up.
---
The only players left in gank squads will be the no-lifers that don't do well in organized PvP (no-lifers, are the players that log into the game and literally wait for enemy players to show up -- they're the ones guarding entrances to dungeons all the time).
---
I would recommend also Dragonfang. Earthshaker has top guilds clear content 1 month before Dragonfang and Bloodfang. So if you are looking for a place where it is easier to shine and compete with the other faction those will be easier. Also on Dragonfang faction ration is pretty equal atm. A little bit in favour of the alliance
---
Did you say, Glock? It's what I call my Thunderfury, blessed blade of the Windseekeer
---
Not completely, but there'll definitely be less. Faster to farm gonor in BG's.
---
Lol so many angry alliance assuming queues with no raw evidence yet on HOW they are doing cross realm.
---
Definitely a little bit, but battlegrounds in vanilla are kind of strenuous. WPvP is still going to be prevalent probably.
---
It is not promoting faction conflict. it promotes toxic behavior and making people hate people. not alliance hating horde...
---
It's not a brilliant game design causing one side to stop playing because they can't play the game as it was intended.
---
The current game is not bad because of server balance. There are a lot of other factors that made the game terrible, for example giving players instant gratification in every way shape or form.
---
The other side has the superior pvp class, but I don't see them leveraging that
---
All the dumb shit they cry about can be said about both factions. Just mad players.
---
Even if I watch a video or guide.
---
Learn by doing is so much better. Watching a video is boring and a chore for a game imo.
---
Explain it well. We attempt it and learn. Granted I know this method doesn't work for all
---
Good idea, I'm gonna do that.  I was doing Wetlands for a while with a similar idea (and faster access to Kalimdor in case I needed it) but Wetlands isn't safe, either. Thelsamar will be. (knock on wood)
---
Except the flight masters are never dead
---
Consider imp inner fire talent for more tankiness.  Necropile is ok as a starting pvp-set
---
It is why I will also level a druid alt to 60...When the -imo- inevitable BC release follows Classic, I will continue my druid as main ;-)
---
It is, 100%. A player vs a player, -&gt; p v p
---
to be honest, just get the best Int/Stam gear you can from instances and quests. There are good leather pieces, but also cloth. I was in cloth/leather/mail when I got to 60!  I have T2 Helm &amp; Legs and 4 pcs of T1, and I still have Cloth chest and shoulders with + healing on them (now I am full resto).
---
Rank 11 disc back in the day. They are squishy and need to drink a lot to spam heals but you have good survival. Your best bet is to pair up with a mage. Yes, a mage not a warrior. Certainly heal the shit out of warriors but warriors are better off with paladins whether holy or ret if the paladin is worth anything. Pally will freedom, sac, cleanse, and heal even if assisting as Ret and gets more mileage because most often healers get sheeped and viper drained.  So, stick to a mage that you can bubble, they have AMAZING peels, can deal with other mages well if you get CC (make sure you equip your trinket you need it), and you get all the water you need. Trust me, mages love priests to pair up with and vice versa. Then you won’t have to worry about being squishy as much because of their control over melee and shaman purge spammers which are your biggest threats.
---
Deliberate.  
---
Targeted.
---
Hate.
---
Nice Job.
---
And with the majority of people not there the ones camping will be a lot easier to kill when it’s 1-3 vs 30
---
As an alliance member who is experiencing an 80 horde /20 alliance split here on Skeram, I feel your pain. Just know that it's not inherently the mean horde or the cowardly alliance, it's just individual players. Not faction specific. :( NO tribalism!
---
Depends on the environment you are playing in. If you're in a casual guild that is just now hitting 60 and starting MC and Ony, sure a few people not knowing 100% what they are doing, but more knowledge benefits everyone.
---
Remove perception from the game, i mean i'm sure humans will be fine without it.
---
Isn't this **fun** guys?!  PvE or Retail.  This is no longer fun in the slightest.  As the numbers dwindle even more, I'm sure the Horde will have a great time playing with themselves.
---
Something I thought about recently. Given that the servers are way bigger than classic, how is that going to effect the economy? So many people trying to farm any and everything to make gold, isn’t that going to bomb the market? Yes that means there’s that many more people needing said items, but I feel that the farming is going to much outweigh need for farmed items, and it’s going to make everything too cheap to sell for the average person willing to go out and farm said items.
---
If you’re looking for a real answer, and not posting this rhetorically, people expect you to have a fairly good idea of what to do because the information is readily available online.
---
Most people learned to play their class or learned the depths of it by studying guides online, so they expect others to do the same.
---
I’m lvl 27, I’m still in Hillsbrad and Ashenvale for the most part, so I guess it’s not as bad here? Some people who are higher lvl just ignore me which is nice of them lol. I’ve had one person who was lvl 34 ignore me on the road. I haven’t actually come across an enemy of my lvl, but it’ll be way more fun to have an actual fair fight. When lvl ??’s attack me it’s just lame. I try to run away before they can.
---
Definitly the coolest thing I have ever been apart of in WoW. I couldn't give a fuck less about all the horde telling me to reroll alliance for honoring my word. You guys kicked Zs ass. 
---
I was really hoping you guys would get a break after weeks of ruthless savagery everywhere you went
---
Where is Chestnutz when you need him?
---
That's what I went with
---
The game is dead. Blizzard killed it. Just unsub and give up.
---
Don’t forget to tell them why

Ya, well, if global warming AS YOU SAY, why are there still monkeys?
---
Played fury dual wield 1 - 60. Used the WW axe from 30 ~ 34 and i hated it. I topped the dps charts on dungeons with dual-wield fury. And the leveling pace... Oh god.
---
I previous lvld a lock to 60. And i can honestly say i died a LOT more on the warlock (of course i took a lot more chances). But also the downtime, my warrior had basically no downtime, just have first aid leveled and ull be good.
---
Felt so rewarding slashing through mobs, LOWER LEVEL MOBS, that's the key.
---
It might hinder the speed at which your guild completes content, but it will certainly not hinder progression.
---
ye, we got number 1-4 all in our guild. they are all rogues and druid. Lots of time and stealth ganking = endless honor
---
You must play Horde.
---
1: The run is way longer.
---
2: You res at the graveyard by TP, so you have to run all around the perimeter of BRM just to corpse run back a few steps. Corpse runs are 2x as long.
---
It's your best chance to preserve world buffs solo by jumping to the MC window, but you can easily lose 20 extra minutes.
---
It could still be extremely bad considering the massive abundance of Horde \*everywhere\* except for a few notable Alliance dominated servers. By in large, Horde still dominates the numbers. Even if you're in a batch of servers with an Alliance heavy one, you could still have massive queues. Really depends on the server batching.
---
Alliance around here are *super* fragile.
---
reported for spam
---
Lucky enough I was already running improved sprint, so yay
---
Or if you are horde running anywhere near badlands pass that is camped by allies 24/7.
---
Alliance...camping gadgetzan...thats a big laugh. I think you meant the 50+ horde there at all times.
---
But there is just no good way of knowing if you know all there is to know about a subject.
---
And what if pvp isnt a core part of your gaming experience? What if you were interested mostly in pve? You ask your friend about the difference and he tells you that you can still do pve on a pvp server, the pvp server just adds more options for you so why not go for it?
---
    
---
How do you know that you do in fact not have correct information here?
---
Do you just read all there is on the internet on the subject?
---
You don't have any reason to believe that your information is wrong until you run into the problem that you can't do pve.
---
I personally handled it by rerolling, not a pve server but on the same pvp server. All the high levels are busy ganking higher level players and leave me alone, I just have the occasional skirmish with players that are close to my level and I'm enjoying my self. I did that since from the information I have gathered things will get better once the battle grounds come out and I can play my level 60 again. But now I have a different problem, is this information also wrong? Is there any way I can tell other than to wait for the battle grounds to come out and see for myself? If you have some easy way for me to verify this information in another way I would love to hear it.
---
dreadmist is high pop tho
---
99% of this thread is stupid
---
If you’re good you should be able to get where you’re going after about 8 deaths.
---
Its only a fucking move if the hunter was planning on raiding MC and knew about BiS, let alone BiS for other classes. The entire point of this post is that you cannot expect people to be on the same level as you.
---
Seriously, they’re just a mean person. I honestly wouldn’t do this to anyone. I’d at least wait until they were done. Or ideally, just attack people around the same level as I am...
---
all of them should be banned
---
Ya mage priest was my favorite 2v2 comp in BC and wotlk.
---
because classic isn't for casuals and thats the entire point. casual craft is retail. classics community has always been about being an elitest. They are literally choosing to play a version of the game with less quality of life improvements. You are entitled to play the game how you want its your money but you bitching about it isn't the community that got the game made in the first place is what is has always been. Its like going to Olive Garden and being mad they serve italian food.
---
appropriate name
---
He's made about twenty posts in this thread with fantastical scenarios where the warlock dominates multiple players. He's either very inexperienced, very young and excitable, or never faced a proper premade - as you say. 
---
If you want to know how things will work in Classic WoW - you look at what happened at the top of pservers. There's a reason guilds like APES, Progress, Salad Bakers, Grizzly went alliance. PVE speedrunning is a a good part of it - but just looking at APES's first kill with exclusively gnome melees show the importance of PVP to these guilds...and they want paladins.
---
Pretty sure in vanilla things are tense but there is no outright war.
---
Fears when you have pvp trinkets and fear ward. Stuns when mages have blinks, or Paladin has bubble. Gnomes have escape artist. Nelves with shadowmeld. You're delusional if you think its that big of an advantage if at all.
---
Numbers based on warcractlogs and people taking a break for phase 2. How do you know they won't do pve + PVP? People making grand assumptions in this thread. All I said was cross realm and people fucking light up
---
Now might be a good time to try and auction those feet of the lynx i dropped 3 months ago
---
Fuck TBC, dogshit expansion that will ruin the game.
---
Depends on how many people are in the zone, sometimes the whole perimeter is guarded and checked. Spy and your corpse happily disappearing only helps them.
---
Need some input from rogue experts. 
---
I’m a gnome rogue so I’m daggers. Gg/cht and I just got core leather gloves last night. That puts me at 310 weapon skill for daggers. Should I stay at 310 or swap some talent points to get back to 305?
---
Also what’s a good add on to show crusader procs and snd duration?
---
and wind fury only procs once every 10 hours.
---
i play ret i have no binds xd
---
Beef jerky - Gotta hang the beef up to dry it out.
---
tBC is more likely than classic+ even though I'd prefer classic+. tBC is just easier to make profitable. No new content needed, follows old script. Classic+ would be a new turn and direction so more effort needed.
---
Yeah people running in a straight line from TP to BRM knowing there are a million horde are just asking for it.
---
The last one was removed for “hate speech” proving this sub is moderated by absolute mongoloids.

Wow reposted already? This was just posted yesterday.
---
They don’t actually have low HP compared to other humanoids their level.
---
There’s a difference between getting help from friends and getting something you haven’t earned. PvP rewards are for people that earn them, not people who think they’re entitled to them just because they want them.
---
People are just expressing how pathetic that is.
---
lol what times are you playing? even as a stealther I need 3 runs sometimes
---
The game is over a decade old. There is no reason to minmax anything. There is no reason to be "optimal".
---
This game is just for fun. Nothing more.
---
Thank you man! Appreciate it the response!
---
No, you talk about these things. If you have no idea what you're dping don't need on random purples without talking about it first.
---
You have two places to ress last i checked, where your body is or with sickness at any spirit healer. Do you know where the next closes spirit healer is in brd?
---
God I hate the fucking mods on this subreddit. They’re akin to steams moderators. Lmao. And that’s really saying something.
---
I’d level with you but I’m on US servers. I plan on getting back into playing once I can set up my station again, but I have no friends and I hate playing alone. Plus I haven’t played through anything past WoD and I’m not about that lonely grind time.
---
This is the downside to bis lists. People see it and decide they MUST farm it 'because its on the list', when the reality is you're going to increase your raid DPS by 10 orders of magnitude more helping your warrior mate get it and missing 20AP for a few weeks.
---
I mean I am glad you are being honest about being an elitist, but thats literally not how it was marketed. It was simply marketed as a return to how WoW once was, without any mention about how the community would be.
---
Also alot of people say that Classic is more casual friendly than Retail.
---
I love that the one place you'd least expect a horde mage to come bouncing out of would be the ironforge bank
---
Btw not sure how DKs work but I'm hoping that you get a DK if you kill someone with rez sickness.  If that is not the case I really think blizz should consider it.
---
That’s who a lot of warriors I talk to get it from, figured I’ll probably get it from him myself as well. Thanks!
---
So Blizz layered so we would have enough mobs to kill. But now no layers and overpopulation pvp'ing is like the wild west over hunting buffalo.
---
Not to mention the pressure.  ~80 people watching you, with epics on the line.
---
Just get better at the game dude . This isn’t spam.
---
Exactly. Rolling on gear "below" your armorgrade shut count as a fucking offspec roll, unless previously agreed upon. I don't know how it became standard to do so, but I suspect in the same way as "all need on boe epic for gold" is.
---
Sorry you’re being camped
---
If you're pulling out a gun every time someone cuts you off while driving, please stop giving advice to any other human beings on how they should live their life. Thanks!
---
To be fair, why should it matter? I don't give a fuck if you're worth honor or not, PvP means fighting other players.
---
The mods are just fucking shills on this subreddit. I’d prefer steam mods to these assholes.
---
Ye if it was the other way round I would feel bad for the horde and understand their issues. Kinda funny how a lot  horde players aren't capable of this basic empathy and decency, or maybe it's wow players in general.
---
Great analogy, as a political junkie, I can really appreciate this.
---
That’s not how it works lol. I’m saying Rez on your corpse but pick a max distance in the circle around it
---
Healing parse rankings don't really matter.
---
SVG is better than the tier piece in MC
---
Im on a PvE server
---
You're making excuses for willful ignorance. It takes only a few mins to Google something or watch a video or ask a question. You want to be spoon-fed or something?
---
Tbh, I get ganked so much I don't need a KoS list, red is dead baby
---
I don't think anyone in a decision making role gives a shit what the team's feelings are. That's business.
---
He definitely knows that but 'it was Rebekah Vardys' account is basically a meme now
---
Elitism exist with everything apparently.
---
I have Hunter, warrior and protest for the 19 bracket, can't wait
---
As soon as we lost I said " Hey Z, you remember that one time you lost Azuregose for the horde?"
---
Sounds nice, usually active at the hours of 08:00-13:00 GMT+1 ( Central EU Time ).
---
Chat Shit Get Banged
---
Imagine watching this shit and thinking "Shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server if you didn't wanted PvP", or "Just get better and outplay them".  
---
Imagine the microcephaly-induced, single digit-IQ you need to come up with that.
---
hahaha how funny would it be if you did the scavenger hunt, and when you get to the first destination, OP comes out of stealth and just murders you. Then says thx for the honor and vanishes.
---
wild
---
you literally sound unstable
---
Paladins are sick in group pvp and mean alliance should win bg's every time assuming equal skill. The op racial shit is bullshit.
---
Mograine Alliance here, i still feel like chucking my monitor out the window every time i have to go to Feralas or Tanaris (thank god for Moonglade Teleport, because Menethil permanently under siege).
---
I got killed killed recently in Thelsamar 3 seconds after i landed. Fucking. Thelsamar. There's literally nothing there, why would you camp there?!
---
I'm aware, that's why I have a bank alt stocked with em, wtv i fish now I sell on Tuesdays. That being said it's currently an infinite resource and there's rarely enough on the AH to meet demand on raid nights.
---
I agree TBC is *far* more likely than classic+, even if I'd prefer the latter. I think it's ultimately more sustainable though.
---
As though that's some sort of threat. Hunters can solo DMNT
---
You really can wait 30 seconds or a minute and the mass of people will move on or chase some one else in most cases.
---
This is an awesome story. Just remember it's not about "horde" being pussies. Because the very same shit you just described happens in reverse when it's an Alliance dominated server and the Horde are the outnumbered ones. 
---
I say that to you an as Alliance heal spec clothie on Skeram... where we're outnumbered 80/20 or so.
---
Buy the cloth out at 11, relist later at a higher price.
---
I mean the game will already be finished at that point. Classic ends after everyone has their naxx gear.
---
"nsfw", really?
---
My Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker is my glock. If I wanted to threaten someone I'd use the draco in the passenger seat.
---
How do you get camped on a pve server
---
I want to try this on my warrior re roll. Anyone have a good talent sheet I can follow? Also why to the "don't try to tank" statement? Is it from the lack of tactical mastery?
---
Eh I usually wait for evidence before I talk shit about something pvp isn’t going away you think people stopped playing AV before when there was the same AOEs going on? Lololol
---
You know can bind it so that when you press control or shift, it moves to your second action or third. You can bind 30s ability if you bind action bar two on shift and action bar 3 on control. Not saying that’s what he is doing. Just fyi.
---
Being short a couple hundred honor points is not pathetic. Not everyone has time to farm the honor, and I would much rather run 40% faster than wait a week because you think I dont deserve the extra speed. Expressing your opinion is fine, but it seems unreasonably salty to tell me I don't "deserve it".
---
Your friend gave you some bad advice for a first time player.
---
This has not been my experience on incenduis.
---
While waiting for my group I enjoy trying to kill alliance trying to run into the instance at SM. Sorry.
---
Question about DPS warrior for raiding and grinding - arms or fury? If fury, dual wield or two-handed weapon? Conventional wisdom suggest that a slow weapon is better because damage output of most abilities is calculated based on weapon damage, and slow weapon has higher damage per hit, but it feels so inefficient when the mob has some super annoying cc ability (immobolize, stun, disarm), and miss/dodge happens a lot, oftentimes I can't successfully land a hit in 10 seconds. It just takes too long.
---
This is such a nice idea
---
haha, this is pretty cool. Would maybe take him 20 mins to loot all the kills though :D
---
to show dominace cancel sub til battlegrounds open.
---
No, it doesn't.  
---
Mocking Blow is a taunt.
---
yeah pvp set hands + boots should be worth it over hands of power+ green boots. Ideally you only equip 3 t1 pieces for the 3-set bonus(Head,Bracers and Gloves), the t1 boots aren't worth using over the pvp set boots.
---
I recommend checking out https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS_P3OaKUY/htmlview?sle=true# if you haven't already.
---
Dwarf, got 2 horde macros one says "BrAwL mE" the other says "BOW"
---
I pop cds &amp; kill both, bandage, then kill Lorekeeper. No Vanish involved unless something goes wrong.
---
alliance player gets instant karma for playing alliance and using the R word
---
It was in Phase 1, but it's not anymore.
---
Fiery weapon has always been popular because it’s a magic proc that ignores armor. Let me guess, you’re a theorycrafter who has never actually twinked in the level 19 bracket? 
---
You’re gonna find out quickly that gimmicks like lifestealing won’t do nothing because level 19 is all about burst, and your target will be dead before it can proc enough to be advantageous.
---
Probs cos horde dominate winterspring most of the time and haha no I haven't been getting camped hard, did a lot pvping last night, what happened to the horde last night tho? There was none in EPL, WPL, seems like you were all in kargath
---
Seems true to me. Last evening there were 0 lvl 60 alliance players in hillsbrad at 7pm. When honor arrived 3 weeks ago, there were over 150 there fighting desperately against 250 horde
---
It's sad because up until recently things were very balanced. 
---
Then last week half of the faerlina alliance transferred over. Now we're imbalanced and the ally AH is insane. 
---
Thanks blizzard!
---
Same, I land and a pack of Horde gank me every time. Then there are roaming packs the entire way to BRD.
---
A
---
have you seen the plate armor alternatives? dps warrior is simply not a thing in exclusive plate.
---
I spoke way too soon about not being camped. A level ?? rogue is camping me rn. Feelsverybad lol
---
This analogy is disrespectful, and you should be embarrassed.
---
Well if we camp the path to DM (Apex) we just engage whoever comes. Sometimes they outnumber us and we die. the rogues like aglais in the original post can ofc choose which fights to take. For alliance life is shit imo. It has gotten better but last night was shit again every fight you take you get mostly rushed by twice the amount of horde. 
---
Everlook/EpL/Searing/BS the flight points are always camped
---
I don’t want to start over though...
---
really?  genius...  I bet no one thought of this b4...
---
haha \^\^ Once i get to Shadowfang Keep theres probably gonna be a lot of looting cus the BoE's in there are hella good.
---
Not for a pvp weapon. No. Thats should be free for all. Its incredibly dumb to rob healers of pvp weapons based on spec. Especially from a meme like enhancement.
---
IMAGINE GETTING DESTROYED IN YOUR OWN CAPITAL AND STILL CRYING ABOUT IT THE ABSOLUTE STATE
---
Here's the thing: it's just that people are assholes. Nothing but douchebags! Somebody is always gonna criticize you over not knowing something, and even if you're knowledgeable they would be complaining about something else you did instead. Not because you're playing wrong, but because they are assholes. You pay your money to play this game and have a good time, and you don't have to listen to what assholes say. Tell them "fuck you" and leave the group and put them on block. You're an adult, you don't have to tolerate that behavior
---
What is the best way to farm all that salve to release the plants?
---
How so?
---
Could you play on US servers?
---
Why are there two identical posts right next to each other?
---
Well, if you're new to the game, how are you supposed to know:
---
1. What PvE vs PvP means
---
2. This is important enough to Google
---
3. How people will act in phase 2 vs phase 1
---
4. That this will be bad enough to render the game unplayable
---
Not everyone sits down for a study session before playing a game.
---
I have an addon called BIS Tracker. When I go to my character screen it allows me to pull BIS by class, spec, and phase.
---
It shows the BIS item tooltip, where it drops, who drops it, and the item drop rate.
---
Took like 1 click to install the addon.
---
PvP gear will make a difference. I run around with a mix of Tier 1 and Necropile. I have around 4k life with fort. Always keep your shield up and equip your insignia. 
---
A single rogue won't do shit against you all of a sudden.
---
This got deleted as I clicked on the post kms
---
No changes, not even changes to fix the issues caused by changes we made.
---
Don't put 3-5 times the population in the same environment and expect it to function the same.  That's a pretty drastic change.
---
True but as I recall you can switch almost instantly doing the scroll wheel keybind. If you’re in cat for example. Quickly scroll wheel up (deselects cat) once then down quickly and that will change you to caster then bear immediately.
---
You are just mad cuz you cannot remain op as fuck in tbc.
---
This is what I suggested to the most people who complained about being overwhelmed but I don't really like your real life analogy.
---
You probably appear dead at your hearth location. I remember this happening with portals.
---
No one owes anyone anything in a pug. Expecting people to be an NPC and let you have gear because you'll use it longer when they don't know you at all is ridiculous and an attitude so prevelant in DPS Warriors that its hilarious. 
---
Yeah, I get it. You're playing a spec that Blizz didn't really itemize plate for til much later in the game so you rely on leather and mail for a long time. Sounds like a severe case of "not my fucking problem".
---
Rogue question:
---
First time playing a rogue (as an alt). I'm trying to decide if slice and dice is worth it and how it's best used. I'm human sword spec and mostly pve. Is it mostly for boss fights or do people use it for higher HP trash or single target questing?
---
Thanks,
---
The pre bis gear for priests is kinda horrible for PvP from what I have seen it's heavily focused on just throughput stats and regen with barely any hp at all. Better stamina gear will help a lot. The priest talent tree also has some nice options to reduce dmg and improve survivability: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/500232133-223051332300102-05 Something like that would make increased stamina even stronger due to dmg reduction.
---
Hmmm... I'm on Sulfuras and it seems fairly even, or maybe I'm just on the higher pop faction. Either way, there are still some days I can't do a damn thing because of world pvp cockblocking me from questing zones.
---
The nostalgia chasers are the only people that matter.
---
&gt; So, value should not be taken into account?
---
correct. thats what ms&gt;os means. if you want people to be restricted based on value the system you want is called "loot council"
---
I'd say using the t1 legs is better in this case until you get t2 legs.
---
Using t1 gloves over hands of power is a 12 sp loss
---
Using t1 legs over skyshroud is a 14 sp loss, but you'll get 1 crit aswell.
---
Very cool video, funny to see all those people chasing after you. 
---
One piece of constructive criticism: your mic is really low. I had to blast my volume to be able to hear you well. Turn it up next time!
---
classic+ won't happen, and that's a very good thing.  It's time to wake the fuck up, and realize blizzard north is dead.
---
Im really waiting in his raid results for this.. The spec fits so well in my own fantasy of the shaman.. Elemental warrior!!
---
The mods here have no idea what the fuck they're doing. They have no semblance of coordination. Their rules are poorly thought up and poorly enforced. It makes no god damned sense. 
---
I've had submissions removed before for "poor quality", then the next day the *exact same thing* hits the front page. When I send the mods a message asking why, they completely ignore me.
---
Seriously the worst mods I've encountered in a long, long time. And as someone who is a mod himself, I feel my opinion on their behaviour is both qualified and justified.
---
Yeah, I might. I'll wait and see if there are any other lonely people who wanna group. EU people aswell.
---
100-150 on my server. Herod life...
---
&gt; No, you talk about these things. If you have no idea what you're doing don't need on random purples without talking about it first
---
A hunter needing on SGC is in no way the same as "having no idea what he is doing"
---
They were being killed and there was no way to rez. Do you really not get that.
---
That would kill the fundamental pillar of the series, which started with a game called Orcs &amp; Humans, later becoming Horde &amp; Alliance as more races were added to the game.
---
And wouldn't you believe it, the Alliance still couldn't get the kill on Azuregos.
---
Strat living drops a good 2h from Balnazzar last boss which should see you through till a raid upgrade.
---
For your level I think the dragons in ST can drop one..the butcher:) hope this helps
---
I've been told(by dozens of fucktards replying to me defending layering pre-phase 2, and a blue post by blizzard) that layering was the lesser of these 2 evils. 
---
Because merging servers is difficult I guess? IDK, I hate people. I still say no changes was the appropriate way to go and that blizz massively fucked up forecasting player interest. But hey, here we are.. yaaaay.
---
Actually he's 60 until TBC Classic.
---
Classic rotations for PVE to be honest are not super interesting overall.  It's an early MMO, and things don't get terribly "hard" until later phases.
---
Warlock does get more interesting.  The voidwalker doesn't scale as you level with even 3/3 improved taunt talent becoming useless, so you have to use imp or succubus, which is a bit more involved as you will do some kiting.  You'll get more dots, you can fear juggle, and you'll run into threat management and threat capping which takes at least some minimal additional effort.  You can can also run felhunter which is a bit more APM to micro/time the counterspell which is useful in some of the end game dungeons (strat/scholo), though less so for raids for now.
---
PVP is way more interesting for all classes. Warlocks really can excel here, but all classes have some skill ceiling when you start carrying around a dozen trinkets.
---
to be fair , France rolled over and gave up, alliance just retreated to stormwind and ironforge and is waiting on battlegrounds
---
ive made several thousand gold waiting on bg its been pretty good tbh
---
Neat tool, i like creative thinking.
---
Though i feel the need to point out: There is a stopwatch ingame. Click the clock beneath your map and hit "Show Stopwatch". Upon entering your first dungeon start the clock. One hour from then and you will be able to go in again, have it on your ingame screen too. :)
---
People expected it because despite what excuses get thrown out like "layering made it hard to tell" it actually happened before.  A couple private servers had this problem when they threw in the pvp system.  The more imbalanced the server the worse it was.  You also have the issue where some of the private servers had thousands of people, closer to classic server pop but better maintained faction balance and the problem was less muted.
---
The two things which were huge red flags were the growing faction imbalance on pvp servers, which was heavily indicated before most of the serverpop mods were affected, and the massive amount of try hard people who were going to want to start their r14 grind immediately with BGs in an unknown future.
---
Should people have simply known?  Not necessarily, but for people who had been through it on private servers, it was expected.  For people who understood the major differences in classic and vanilla were not going to be from the game but the players themselves, it was expected.  The problem I have is with so many people trying to blame X or say they couldn't have seen this coming, but there were shitloads of warnings.  People chose to either ignore them or believe in an idea of what vanilla was without understanding why it was that way.  Hell, even when guilds leveled and killed Rag within the first week of classic should have been another massive red flag.
---
The bottom line is there are a lot of people who have mythologized vanilla as this ideal of WoW.  They want to look past so many of the bad aspects of the game or the context of the game to see it as this shining beacon on a hill.  Classic has not been vanilla and he single biggest change has been how the player base approaches the game. No one wants to come out and say Vanilla wasn't that great, it was a product of being new and shrouded in mystery.  Vanilla and therefore Classic have to be great.  If they aren't great, then it is Blizzard's fault for fucking it up.  This type of nostalgia happens in everything, not just Vanilla/Classic.  
---
How often do people talk about how they wish they could go back to "the good ole days!".  How many times to you hear people say they wish they could go back to high school/college?  They have an idea of how those times were, because they approached life different.  If they were suddenly transported back in time knowing everything they know at the present, they would approach their past more closely to how they approach their life now.  Perhaps they "do better", but it wouldn't be the same.  It would certainly be a weird situation if EVERYONE went back to the same time and they all knew what they knew form the present. Going back in time would be an entirely different experience, and it wouldn't be the fault of time travel but the people themselves who went back in time.
---
This is the reality.  Classic was never going to be what people mythologized vanilla because the entire context of vanilla was dead and gone.  Vanilla was based on the players exploring a new game and trying to understand new mechanics.  By now the game is fully explored and those mechanics are locked down.  The game is about optimization of performance because that is the only thing left to do.
---
Why can't you try it in Classic?
---
By one of the countless DPS Warriors, no less!
---
Some say he's still out in Hillsbrad fighting to this day
---
That also happens sometimes when the quest was just started before you arrived...you then have to wait in the throne room slowly seeing your disguise run its course :D
---
Often, it will run out halfway the quest, but by that time it doesn't matter anymore as long as you stay your distance.
---
Paladins would have eaten their lunch though. So damn strong vs undead mobs.
---
Haha good joke
---
&gt; But Asmongold said it him self, that he banned Advertise for ganking him!
---
And that makes sense to you. A billion dollar company was like yes we give you authority to ban anyone lol. or does it seem more likely he is making shit up like usual to look powerful.
---
At 30 you'll get Elemental Fury and Windfury imbue. Things get a little easier then.
---
Some entitled pricks posting in there. Geez.
---
Good thing blizzard made the pvp flag gone as soon as you enter the city in which there are rogues at every corner, oh wait, it doesn't
---
Shaman is what you want.
---
That sounds like a recipe for disappointment. 
---
Most DPS Warriors are genuine 80IQs.
---
Ahh yes the 5Head take. Let's imagine another timeline where we had no layering and a real vanilla server pop hard cap. Complete laissez fair hands off approach. That means a terrible launch experience, 100's of more dead servers with no server merges, even worse faction imbalance, more spergs complaining about how they can't play the game in the most min/maxed way possible, people complaining about queues, people complaining about they cant play with friends. The list just goes on and on. All of these problems are systemic issues that can't be fixed with a bandaid or a patch. I can see one solution to your problem though. It's them releasing BG's and spoiler alert...they will be released. Maybe just wait for them?
---
yeah i know, i'm still working on trying to improve my mic quality. I'm glad you liked the video :)
---
Your buddy Crix is the one that brought up parsing as a defense for being a good warlock. I'm not saying either is right, but you can't have it both ways
---
I thought this was going to be more shenanigans of our hero chestnutz
---
lmaoooo
---
I might be on the recieving end of some issues but I still wouldnt just categorically consider everyone a plain asshole.
---
I genuinely understand your concern however, I'm already geared for Hit chance over defensive mitigation. If I go Deep prot, here is what I gain that is even worth mentioning.
---
Anticipation: 10 Defense. From a mitigation standpoint this is absolutely not breaking a healers back.
---
Concussive Blow: Almost useless in Raids outside of some Ony Mobs 
---
Improved Shield wall: Again 3 seconds is not a make or break talent point
---
Shield Bash: Again with the damage your doing with Fury, Revenge is more than enough. Even with Sword and Boarding it with Fury/prot. You absolutely don't need Shield slam.  
---
So from a Mitigation standpoint you need to sacrifice Hit chance pieces which are in my opinion monumentally more valuable. Your shield slam's worthless if it misses. As is any part of threat gen.  
---
If I thought this was going to wipe raids and prevent me from tanking properly I wouldn't even explore the idea. And in our Ony runs threat has absolutely been and issue. DPS is contently have to be called to stop because they are catching the MT's threat.  
---
I have been practicing and as far as just Sword and Boarding it with fury prot. Almost nothing is different. The difference is knowing when its okay to macro out that shield, from what I've been learning so far.
---
Only so much you can do when you are outnumbered that badly sadly
---
Can you not renew them? I feel like that'd be better in so many ways if so...
---
I've always hated the argument "you signed up on PVP server, you got PVP" argument that kept popping up everytime someone mentioned ganking (and not liking it). The game doesn't have a popup warning when rolling on PVP server that says "Beware, you won't get actual Player Vs Player. You'll get ganking and Player Vs Group." People always assume the newbies have all the out-of-game information but that's wrong. When I started in TBC I rolled on a PVP server for two reasons. First, it was the major Czech server and second I liked the official idea of PVP servers. I had little idea about MMOs so I imagined it like Warcraft 3 without armies - two heroes fighting over a valuable creep camp in a long battle, where the better one wins and the losing can choose to run away. Instead I got ganking, camping and Horde jerks chasing me all over the zone just to ruin my day. Like 1% of "PVP" was actual fair PVP.  
---
The issue is that on PVP server we didn't experience "PVP" for the first 20 levels. By that time we were heavily invested in our guilds and characters. Moving out wasn't an option. Even if we wanted, the transfers were paid. And the "PVP" got worse and worse with every expansion. I gave up in WoD and paid transfer away from PVP realms. I really hated the wannabe PVPers arguing "It's PVP server, what did you expect". It made me really want to learn how to slap people over internet. We didn't expect ganking, because the game didn't warn us about ganking in the first place, genius! Newbies who don't know the attitudes of online gamers can't expect that many people consider ganking lowbies who cannot fight back as the pinnacle of PVP.
---
Thank god we have Warmode in Retail now. It has some issues, but it can be turn off in every inn...
---
That mainly I guess. It's just like "owning the libs". You know the guy on your side is an absolute disgusting PoS, but he's owning the libs, so it's all good ;-)
---
And so he started blasting
---
BGs are coming in less than a week. Most people are still doing MC and Ony every chance they get. BWL is coming. Plenty to do soon.
---
Oof, being kicked AFTER getting into BRD... that's low af.
---
Someone's server rep should take a hit for that.
---
&gt;I WILL try another pickpocket run
---
Its best to get into a mentality of doing this more than just "another run". Set aside plenty of time and do routes over and over again for an hour / hours. Do it a few times a week or do it as 100% of your play. It's instanced and solo gold creation where you're not competing with anyone but yourself. Vanish is fine - only use sprint if your pick pocket resists so you can sprint, make some distance between the mobs, and then vanish. 
---
Even with combat and resists its good gold. Open junkboxes and sell the major healing potions (1-1.5g each) and keep blinding powder or even sell blinding powder on AH since some rogues are spending 100% of their time in the open world and have cash to burn on it.
---
When I hit 60, I just pickpocketed until I had like 3000g. I bought enough runecloth to get an epic raptor as orc, and still have leftover gold that I pretty much just raidlog with and only pickpocket more if I have to enchant something and my gold dips "too low" for my standards.
---
Best of luck.
---
I just don't understand how it's disrespectful. All I'm doing is drawing an analogy to a time in history where people used guerrilla tactics. I could use any number of wars but ww2 seemed fitting.
---
Is the disrespect that I'm comparing it to a video game? If so you must also have a huge problem with the ww2 shooter franchises.
---
Actually it’s a lot of fun because you’re limited by your abilities, so raw skill comes more into play. Most classes don’t have any CC or avoidance at level 19 so you have to play more strategically without having an “oh shit” button.
---
Leatrix Pro UI package
---
A good example of hows there's no such thing as an infinite resource in practice :) It requries time to level up fishing &amp; fish them, and a lot of people find fishing boring. Even at 1g each they're cheap for the time spent to fish them, compared to other gold farms available.
---
&gt; Were People banned or punished for this in vanilla?
---
Yes they were.  I don't know how often it happened or specifically how egregious the offense had to be, but over time the guild I would pvp with had a couple people suspended for this kind of stuff.  Mostly it was due to trying to troll the Horde pvp guild on the server when we would get their A team of guys going to top rank.  The game because stall however you could.  They would do the same to out A team as well and I know we reported them for it so they did the same to us.  I do remember one game in particular was at around 4 hours when a gm finally forced the flag carriers back into the graveyards.
---
Please can we get some hordes posting their instant queues on the 10th and shut them all up
---
That's what I thought, just wanted to verify.
---
No, only ally player our effected by this right now. How dare you pretend the allys are doing the same thing they complain about the Horde doing.
---
How does this show horde "camping everyone everywhere"? It seems to show horde stuck in this building surrounded by alliance.
---
Fuck em'
---
Yah, my toon is a 60 shaman, first time 60 in wow. I let people know if it was my first time in that particular dung. I'd look ahead at wow head so I had a working idea of what it was and people were more than accommodating. Players had no problem telling me if something was a strong shaman item and to roll need.
---
That said shamans don't overlap much gear wise with other classes so that might be why people play less of the 'I have a secret' game.
---
i wouldn’t use any of the T1 items except for the bracers. preraid bis is better than everything T1 except bracers. get whipvine cord from DM:E final boss and forget about the set bonuses from T1 - they aren’t worth it at all.
---
Wait until Naxx before calling this game "extremely easy"
---
And if your queue is 20+ minutes, you're just gonna sit in town twiddling your thumbs, right?
---
DejaClassicStats is extremely useful.
---
Yes i am 60... I avoid EP coz if always camped by ally group and cant do shit, dire maul entrance is ally territory, have to run few times if i wonna enter to instance..then numbers do not mean shit..and as far i can see nobady imortant moved...so stop crying
---
Hit 60 on a mage on herod. Got kinda burned out of the mage thing. Rolled a warrior on grobb. 
---
I'm like 32? 
---
Re rolled the warrior on another account on herod... Thinking I'd tweak the warrior out sooner with a massive gold infusion.
---
Can't decide which to commit to. My biggest factor is ensuring player base will remain active as I continue this journey. Any thoughts? I'm going to slow roll it most likely. Maybe purchase instance runs during those odd levels to make the grind easier and will likely go 1h furry for fun.
---
It procs redoubt and reckoning, I assume it works for all crit-reactive procs. My warrior alt is almost to the level to test it. Warriors in my guild told me that it did work when I asked.
---
Everyone benefits when everyone cooperates. I've passed items to others who needed it more, and have had others pass items to me that I needed more. They don't have to be the same people for it to work.
---
I suggest you respec to sub/hemo/cb it will help a lot. If you need to raid you'll have to respec back and forth, but its worth it.
---
I really dont care about BiS enough to deny someone an upgrade just because it might be a better upgrade for me.
---
I’ve been killed in Org more than 10 times since phase 2. If you don’t feel like pvping you just wait 5 min to be unflagged, res and go do w/e.
---
Well, we do need to be more sensitive to the gnome race I guess...
---
I think neat plates does this too.
---
In defensive/bear what isn't agro is red, blue is have agro.
---
In DPS red is bad and blue is good, yellow is slow down.
---
Maybe my assignement was wrong then cause when OT wasnt taking any damage i was on raid duty and it was a bit frustrating to get sniped by chain heals of other shamans.
---
Will see how i do tonight with MT duty !
---
Sounds hard to believe given AQ opening is a Thing :D
---
But hey - who am I to know - all I do is lay on the ground dead all day. I love PVP servers
---
Sometimes I let flurtgub fireball a few times
---
Nice Jebait OP. Killed some yetis yesterday just to test it out, they don't give DHK's.
---
Eh, people pay it so it's not that surprising. Frankly I'm surprised they don't charge more. 
---
People wanting to transfer are probably willing to pay more than $25 if I had to guess.
---
&gt; If yes to both, then you aren't using your spells effectively.
---
Or the fight is trivialized. No need to flagellate yourself over some fights that simply don't put out enough damage. You are right on all other accounts tho.
---
mods are gay
---
just gotta move to a place where you dont have to worry about locking the door
---
#winning
---
am also old :(
---
listen to this guy
---
I would assume this is how they would do it, this is how a lot of private servers handled it, started new TBC servers with free transfers/copies of characters.
---
*Eyyo what up Bird?*
---
I would love a middle ground server. For me it would be RP PvP with no honour in wPvP (or a better honour system). Though this would be changing the game, so I'm not sure.
---
I guess we mainly just expected you not to be a bitch. But since you are one you should have done some research. Let this be a life lesson for you;)
---
It was said on our discord
---
Don't worry a lot about stacking +healing in PVP as a Priest. Wear whatever bonus healing is practical but your main focus should be stacking stamina and int. The logic being you can't heal if you're dead or OOM.
---
Still the same old racist content though!
---
&gt; There are many players that have never played WoW before
---
Because these players are in the extreme minority. When speaking in generalities it makes perfect sense to not include them
---
What a ridiculous take; Warlock is super OP in TBC...
---
Honestly if I was in the group and someone removed someone else for the leader's friend I would leave too.
---
Talking about the game right now.
---
ye but i think the demand for those items will also become larger when the BGs come out soon
---
scripted
---
Well, it’s obvi spit you’re one of ‘those guys’, so this conversation is pointless. Besides there not being any instances of my spreading false and/or incorrect information in the Disc, I will add that I I literally have never in my life asked you anything related to Locks or any other topic, because 1) no clue who you are, 2) I don’t need help with loot prio or help improving. Sorry, but you must have me sorely mistaken. 
---
However atleast we agree that the Lock discord is one fo the best BB. See you around. 😊
---
Ive seen so many people kicked for not running “optimal meta” builds or weapons. Its frustrating. Let people play and learn. Who the fuck wants to try hard on a 15 year old game? Its not like you can claim any “firsts”, ITS ALL BEEN DONE AND FIGURED OUT. So stupid. Its just turning away newer players and will kill the game
---
You guys need to stop this factioned bitching. Horde are not the only people out there enjoying PvP, you don't have to play an orc to not feel bullied. 
---
You rolled up on a high pop server for whatever dumb reasons you had at the time. Stop trying to make it into anything more than that.
---
Sincerely, 
---
Alliance player who isn't emotionally scarred by world PvP because I didn't follow a streamer to a busy server
---
No, it was a 1 in 200 drop rate if I remember correctly, but that game was full of drama queens. Hats were a big deal.
---
CHT is also BiS for fury warriors when paired with aged core leather gloves or edgemasters. all the wowhead etc bis lists are wrong.
---
Stalagg? Is that TicTac nuking him? That dude roams IF all day
---
I think there’s a few ways around forced name changes. And I think a forced name change pales in comparison to #somechanges mega servers that are causing the game and the community to fracture in P2. 
---
Also, merges would only be needed if the pop dwindles to unplayable levels. Obviously right now that’s not even close to the case on the majority of US/EU servers, which are principally what we’re discussing.
---
What raid frames are you using?
---
&gt;As opposed to Warriors needing shit left and right having items on their BiS list
---
There's 2 raids out at the moment, of which has what, 3 armor pieces viable for DPS warriors. BGs aren't out either, and not everyone enjoys pvp. So what's really left of the game? Getting marginal BiS upgrades. I'm not going to expect people to know and understand other class BiS lists, but I'll also let you know if you're in my farming group that I'm going for a specific item, and if you don't like that, well DPS aren't exactly a rarity.
---
Wolf mount from LBRS (Halcyon) would be awesome.
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/JoyousArbitraryApeRiPepperonis](https://clips.twitch.tv/JoyousArbitraryApeRiPepperonis) it was admitted during live stream
---
Why are we better off? 
---
Situation A: Neet pays lots of gold for gear this week. 
---
Raid logger gets tons of gold at end of raid.
---
Next week, raid logger has tons of gold, why would he not spend it on gear?
---
I have one of these items and am horde on grobb if you want to test it out. If you have one, I'd also be fine risking a DHK on one of my chars, they are pretty low rank.
---
Any good builds for a Holy Priest that can also do some solo DPS at 60?  Looking to mostly heal 5 mans, but want to be able to solo some quests and farming I have to.  I remember damage as fully holy priest was awful when I played the class before.  Figure there has to be something with a nice balance.
---
Its not an exploit its working as intended
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13369/fire-striders
---
Fire Striders are good for conflag spec
---
I know for a fact people were banned for this.  I personally on one account was trying to learn how to do it and got a 3 day suspension.  I wasn't even carrying the flag, simply exploring.
---
Imo if you wanna go cheap just go Dual Cruel Barbs with Lifestealing or Fiery.
---
&gt; Try get 3 set for 0.1 second cast time on flash heal.
---
With heal batching, I don't know that this actually does anything aside from switch which heal goes over in the event of a "tie". In terms of actual survivability, I think this set bonus has zero utility.
---
Ive heard that the only thing left to truly achieve in Classic WoW is speedrunning stuff and to be as efficient as possible. Sounds horrible to me but to each their own.
---
Meanwhile on Golemagg we have Alliance guilds gifting the kill to horde just so other Alliance won't get it.
---
I actually twinked in the 19 bracket for ever it existed. And no you are absolutely wrong. Just keep on being wrong, there's no point in discussing with you.
---
When I was leveling and doing dungeons and someone immediately said "Sorry I'm new to the game, never did this X before." I was in full total support! I remember doing my first MC, Ony, BWL, heck even Dead Mines and it was truly a crazy experience. 
---
I just told the DPS to follow me since I'm a lock and try not to pull mobs, or I would tell the tank what targets to prio and ranged to CC! 
---
And my favorite part is watching them progress at 60 in raid... they get there Benediction/Anathema, you hear them geek out in Discord for their Rok'Delar, Perdition Blade drops and every rogue freaks out!   
---
I played on classic/tbc/wotlk servers for the past 3 years, so most of the game to me is pretty familar to me. The only vanilla private server experience I've had was up to BWL, so I'm still figuring out the different itemizations/phase gear correctly (some servers started with ALL quest items in the game at launch, LIKE Rockfury bracers, DM, class quests etc.)
---
The issue is people knew what they were getting into but still rolled pvp and they are now filling this subreddit with complaints. Don’t like the current situation on your server? Move or reroll. What do you expect blizz will do for you? They won’t do anything, so it’s time to maybe stop complaining

---
You don't go the gloves or belt on the tanks, unless you're purely going for speedclears and plan on replacing everything for BWL, at which point taking it from your rogues is plain dumb.
---
Save money for mount :)
---
Maybe but the number of people who never played Vanilla but played WoW before is much much higher.
---
The answer really is run dungeons then. You'll get your pre raid bis gear while also leveling.
---
Just to clarify, which faction are you talking about?
---
This is classic wow, what's a rotation guide? Classes are literally of a couple types, spam one button pressing cooldowns if available, or pressing a builder and then spender. This isn't retail with complex rotation guides with variances that need to be known if different criteria are met.
---
I'm fairly sure you go for the tier set though no?
---
That's kinda neat, but the whole needing to use an outside communication source to arrange it cheapens it immensely for me.
---
The beauty of cross faction interactions lies more in the difficulty communicating + reward for violence being overcome and resisted.
---
Iam looking die an addon that makes it possible to move my Buffy and debuffs, Like Buffalo(?) Did on an 1.12 client
---
Because you will use 8/8, not a mix.
---
He can't, they dumped toxic waste all over their home and refuse to clean it up so they just mooch off the dwarves.
---
You're so close, I would just go for the epic mount, it'll make all subsequent gold farming for the other stuff way easier
---
Just wanted to point out - Just because you CAN wear plate doesn't mean you should.  I very rarely have mobs hitting me so what use is the armor for?
---
Great explanation. I found it quite useful when testing it but couldn't get the rotation right.
---
This 100% and the fact that it is like 99.9% cheaper for them to just roll out TBC, especially when they know there is a demand for it, because there definitely is a demand for it. Sure, TBC got the ball rolling on a lot of things that started the doom of WoW, but maybe with what they know now they will change SOME things about TBC. Like maybe they will just nix flying mounts altogether and remake the few zones that you need a flying mount for to be accessible with ground mounts. But... even that might require too much work on their part...
---
Can we please quarantine the posts bitching about world pvp yet?
---
Except, you only know this because you know already. People don't know what they don't know. Not everyone looks at forums or subreddits before even starting to play a given game.
---
You also can be wrong about wanting PvP vs PvE, especially considering that the threads early in Classic's life cycle definitely were predictive at best and were definitely not handing out dire predictions of the amount of ganking and one-sided fights that came to pass.
---
It's basically the best expansion they ever released lol. What are you on about?
---
I know the previous wording was "week of Dec 10th" so thought I'd share
---
I agree with having a blind experience and just enjoying the game for what it is whether you've experienced it before or not, although just know that if you choose that path in a game thats been released for 15 years that you're purposefully handicapping yourself bc everyone else is gonna min max. Thats just the nature of competition. Casual vs Elite has been in the game since the beginning. It's just that much further unbalanced towards the Elitist bc again the games been min maxed with 15 years of data gathering. Either deal with your choice and enjoy what you can in your blind experience or join the ranks and begin to gather data for yourself.
---
I'm playing Alliance on RP-PVP EU and it seems to be slightly in favor of Alliance but I think it's pretty darn close to 50/50.
---
I don't play warrior so whether or not wowhead is wrong for them, idk.
---
I do know that as an orc or human , EMH is a "waste" but I'm sure CHT/Perds would be amazing on a warrior, but giving those weapons to a warrior over rogues is silly, at least until all the rogues who want to play dagger spec can do so 
---
The options for warriors putting out comparable dps is a very wide range, so many axes and swords rn.
---
MC will be getting cleared for the next 18 months though, so dagger warriors will def become a thing as more warriors are permitted to roll on daggers
---
Which is fine, in your own group. I just dont think people should pug and expect pugs to be clones of theMselves in terms of play style. If people wanna run a hardcore guild, cool all the power to ya, I dont care for it but you do you. The thing is, when you want to group with me, I shouldnt be expected to conform to your style nor you mine.
---
I doubt these jumps will be possible at all since we got a new client, where these are supposed to be fixed.
---
Queuing will be cross realm so queues won't be as big as people are imagining in the vast majority of servers.
---
Yes, ran into one a while back and spent a good 30 minutes just explaining different things to him concerning abbreviations and showing him what wowhead was.
---
I'm alliance and it was late so I misread faction/realm. You're right no cross faction. Also you sound insane.
---
This 100%. Get that epic mount bro.
---
AV is such a blast it’s not an “honor grind” at all. I hit exalted back in TBC without even trying for it because I was having so much fun. If people actually play the strategy like the old level 60 bracket, and not just zerg to the end, it’s right up there with the best moments you can have in this game.
---
 My guess is the min/maxers are only going to focus on honor per hour and not the actual gameplay, so there’s going to be a lot of tears and crying in bg chat. The way some people are approaching Classic is like it’s retail, and they have to be ready for the expansion in a hurry, only there’s no expansion and they’re ruining everybody else’s game with their attitudes.
---
Classic WoW is a time sink, but that’s also what a lot of the veterans loved about it.
---
5 in spirit tap and take some of the damage based holy and disc talents.  It's not so terrible.  Also ensure you have some gear that is +dmg and not solely +heal, that's essentially a dead stat while soloing
---
The best hunters did hunter/druid 2v2 but that wasn't me. The faceroll comp in TBC was druid/warlock/hunter. I just had to trap, kite, and viper sting
---
Yep. Sulfuras and Grobbulus are the most balanced, then Faerlina and Incendius. The rest of the servers are one sided garbage for the most part.
---
Some people are just assholes. It's as simple as that.
---
Heck I get why people do the whole 5+v1 to farm honor. I can understand that it is most likely the most efficient farm. But those bad manners? That's just sad.
---
You're saying that you're expected to know other people's bis. I said you don't, they will probably tell you and if they won't, you can ask.
---
Yeah, casters and tanks are the only ones who NEED to flask, healers can do it as well ofc and melee can pop a Titans so they can take more dmg but it doesn't help their dps, just helps with clear times (less dying = more dmg output and less downtime)
---
What people don't get it its not about dying a lot. I am sure people on relatively balanced servers die a lot,but people are complaining because on some servers balance is terrible and its impossible to do anything. Open world content is unavailable to you. Period. I love excitement of risk of getting ganked but currently there is no risk. I just know I'll die the second I land and it will take 1 hour+ to reach ny destination. I would be fine if I knew there was a chance that my faction is currently controlling tp or whatever, or if I could contribute for zone control, thats not the case. Its not even techically a game by definition.
---
This was literally yesterday's top post except linked here https://gyazo.com/073479fb469fc7055dd8d8ba31725a97
---
&gt; At that point people are still at like 85% HP and don't really need healing so it's just a waste of mana.
---
These people are the perfect candidates for a cheap r3 renew, wtf are you even talking about lol. If they took damage before, they can take it again. Might as well have a hyper efficient renew ticking on them to top them off anyway.
---
&gt; they'd need a direct heal to get them up faster
---
Per target, heals are faster. Across many targets, renews have a TON of HpM because they are as fast a flash heals, 4x as efficient, and often heal for more.
---
&gt; and that's the only one that is that efficient.
---
With sufficient +Healing, renews are more efficient than healing up to rank 6 or so.
---
&gt; Math doesn't always show you what's practical.
---
I completely [disagree](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/PcVwDfCHjZG6XJkd/#fight=52&amp;type=healing).
---
Buy mana / health pots on the week, sell them on Sunday

That's fucking hilarious

Totally agree with your opinion. I played on Flamelash realm and my open world pvp experience was literally ganking experience. I had to die 7-15 times before reaching BRD from Thorium Point. If I fight someone in 1v1 battle somewhere like in Felwood and win, I always have 5+ hordes come to me and camp my corpse for killing their mate. I always played on PvP servers, and my best vanilla memories are about world PvP I won and lost. But what I see now is not PvP and they advise me to roll on PvE server because I can’t fight 5 rogues after resurrection...
---
Holy shit that's fucking detestable. I'm truly sorry, and hope that shaman hangs himself.
---
Is it? If 12 agi is worse than 1% crit then only marginally.
---
I didn't mean it feels like. I mean it's a tactically similar situation.
---
lol ouch! what did you do??
---
Not at all, I am perfectly happy on my lower level character. What I'm not happy with is being called willfully ignorant when I'm clearly just ignorant.
---
And why was rolling on a pvp server a dumb choice?
---
From the information I gathered I could still do all the pve I wanted on a pvp server and I did not have any contradicting experiences untill I reached level 60. Its not willful ignorance if I sought out information but the information I found was wrong.
---
Logically, i would assume they would be in demand now so people can get their twink ready for BG. I dont think many are playing arm tho so it could be that. Tbh I am holding mine til shortly after BG to sell.
---
You miss the exact same amount of times while while levelling since only the oh has a miss penalty and there is no hit gear till your 50s

---
And Seal Fate becoming arguably the best PvE build in AQ, makes it better. 
---
PvP side is more playstyle based tbh, are you going for isolated 1v1s or group pvp?   
---
I've still always preferred daggers for PvP, but Swords are arguably superior for the 1v1 stunlock.
---
&gt;Horde are generally more pve oriented and not interested in pvp.
---
Because we get stomped to hell and back. Can you blame them? Heck, they even run away in mayority (things like 7 vs 5) because they know in a matter of minutes you will see 20 extra alliance out of nowhere.
---
Sorry but either you just a big fanboy, else you just dont get it! have a great day...
---
I think we'll see a lot of "Damn those pre made groups!"
---
And those that are playing blind ruin the experience for the people who don't want to stand around with a thumb up there ass. I don't expect you to know everything but taking 10 minutes to google the basic idea behind certain things shouldn't be such a mountain of a task if you expect me to spend an extra hr in a dungeon or work x2 as hard because you're doing 90 dps or you took what is BiS from someone else that has specifically farmed for that 1 item for 2 weeks because it was purple.
---
Here is proof

There is, it's called being a Discipline Priest.
---
Hey, no need to be using that kind of hatespeech around here. 
---
Mods plz remove.
---
You can AFK through that quest.
---
Actually, you are probably better off afking so u don't get aggro or die to some random shit.
---
You can still view removed posts if it's linked, you just won't find it normally.
---
maximum tuck for sure, full tuck initiated
---
Grob is arguably the most even server you can play on
---
BiS tracker's data is kinda shit though.
---
It has so many errors and is so slow at updating that it's just invalid for a lot of classes.
---
I do use the add-on to build custom-made BiS lists that are more accurate.
---
I prefer the Icy Veins BiS list because it offers alternatives, and the wowhead one because it offers the most detailed BiS list by phase (pre and post raiding).
---
You can’t ambush or backstab without a dagger. You will open from stealth with ss or garotte (not sure if you will know garrote at 19). After that you will just ss spam and eviscerate at 5 points. 
---
For talents I think you want improved ss and improved gouge from combat. Then Malice from assassination.
---
What exactly are you looking for? I haven't used Prat, but I have found that just default chat with the class color console command does me just fine.
---
For sure, yea
---
Nah, I want them to get no honor instead of sheeping me for 30 seconds and then killing me for honor
---
I've hit 60 recently and ran SFK for the heck of it - it's surprisingly fun to just race thru an instance and completely overpower anything and everything you see.
---
But yea, loot's an issue - so much stuff, so much garbage.
---
how does this get upvotes 10 hours after someone else posted the exact same gif...
---
Just because leather might be your BiS doesn't mean plate won't get the job done. That's the problem people.treat BiS lists like anything less is unacceptable instead of just another option.. it's not required but people act like it is and that's what causes the divide. 
---
I don't run pugs ( thank God).but as a leather wearer I would be extremely annoyed to have a plate wearer roll on an upgrade against me and would probably immediately drop group.  I know leather is BiS for a lot of warrior items but that doesn't mean plate is not useful at all.  It's also unfair as it immediately gives the warrior more loot to roll on and more chamces for upgrades( a warrior is not going to pass on a plate upgrade because it's not BiS but I can't roll on that as a leather wearer) making it that much harder for leather wears to even get pre bis blues or leveling blues. 
---
But this is why I stopped puging pretty early once I realized every player was chasing BiS lists at the expense of everyone else.  It already sucks enough that imhabe to roll against warriors and druids and hunters for.trinkets and rings and neck pieces and leather with druids. Adding another class is just unnaceptable to me..
---
yes me too
---
Do grey quests give rep out? Trying to gain some extra gold and rep from factions on my level 60. If i do grey quests will they still give me rep?
---
Top parses for healing are 100% coupled to top parses of dps.
---
The best healing parse will be the one with almost no healers and biggest dps. In such fights flashheals are usually the best. That's why heal parses are literally useless as a overall comparison. 
---
It's also brutally misleading: If you are a low end healer on a low end raidpug and try to spam flashheal like a pro in MC you will be oom 30% into the fight, because the fight does not last 20s, it lasts 2-4min. Those groups also don't do Ragnaros presons.
---
Also, not everyone is alliance, so your advice is very one dimensional anyways.
---
With 700 healing, it's worth noting that r3 renew is only half the healing of r8 for 1/3 of the mana. I find that r8 overheals anyway, since people either get topped off before it finishes or they were damaged enough to warrant a bigger heal.
---
*faction fight!*
---
Ah, I see alliance also suffers from the same problem. In Herod you can't stay AFK in the open, east of the Orgrimmar bank area, because some gnome mage bots have been spawning on the roof of the buildings nearby, casting spells on random targets and then jumping down for their imminent deaths so they can repeat the cycle. This had been going on for weeks already, so AFKing near the bank area is like playing Russian roulette.
---
i said some pretty strong words about people who recently got caught banned botting 
---
basically f em suck a d unts , caught me 2 weeks 
---
i could understand if i was talking to a specific person or people on reddit but i just said it in general
---
fuck cheaters
---
Same
---
THIS SHIT IS GENIUS!!11111!!1!!   Ima copy this down for future generations.
---
Sure, but the overall population is only 60/40 on PvP server. And lots of PvE players will be queuing as the rep rewards for BGs are sick in PvE. Plus, lots of PvE server players do enjoy BG pvp. They just don't like the roving deathballs ruining their day. 
---
So with the PvE servers it's going to be like 55/45 in favour of Horde, queuing for BGs, which will result in a 5 min-ish queue.
---
If you're up for a new UI, TukUI has this built in above the target nameplate. I find it super helpful on fights like Garr where I can DPS on something and just keep a glance on my target's bar to swap over and re-banish.
---
Who is this bothering? Other than the mods everyone on both sides seems to find this .gif hilarious. But that's beside the point,
---
&gt;refill on a carebear server.
---
What are they refilling on carebear servers and are they free/unlimited?
---
Choose between lionheart helmet / axe of the deep woods + trashblade +devilsaur set, find a guild and start raiding.
---
I mean if the hunter is in a random group by himself, needing on HoJ wouldn't be a mistake. But i knew it was really unreasonable to take HoJ from a melee, especially when we get a free DM trinket that's super good.
---
Enchanting question. 
---
Is it easier to farm to get gold to buy high level enchanting recipes or farm just the recipes themselves.
---
Blocked for some copyright violation
---
I ate Taco Bell for the first time in 5 years and I pyroblasted so hard I thought I was going to damage the ceramic in the toilet.
---
None of the alliance guilds organize it, people are just trying to rank, and it was (sometimes is) the best place to farm honor before everyone sat there.
---
disenchant the one im wearing and pick that up, then someone told me to run to a vendor and sell my bop one then pick this one up and mail it, then rebuy my bop one, but it was too late, so rip 30gold
---
Do you have logs? I could tell you a lot more with logs, like if your deep prot tank is performing properly, or if your raid dps is even high enough to warrant DW fury/prot.
---
I had the same problems and switched to fury/prot around 58 to get the increased threat generation from the prot tree while in def stance. It’s hard to hold agro until you get better gear as well. It gets better though so hang in there. 
---
Make sure to use your demo shout and battle shout when pulling groups. I’m always surprised when warriors don’t do that. Best way to grab initial threat. 
---
Also remind your group to focus on skull and x and to give you time to get threat before starting the aoe. And if they’re consistently pulling too much threat sometimes you gotta let them die to teach them a lesson. Heh.
---
Source?

Walk away, head held in shame
---
The game is over 15 years old.
---
That said if you are new and don’t know what you are doing announce it in the beginning instead of “winging” it. I am sure people will be far friendlier and offer advice if they know you’re a newb before a wipe instead of after.
---
If you’re offended by his analogy then I suggest just staying off the internet, or you’re in for a bad time.
---
I’ve been trying to farm Emp and Princess for Priest BiS but only made it once due to parties always falling apart or giving up after getting what they need. I’ve been part of so many runs I’ve seen THREE HOJs drop.
---
&gt;Currently level 28
---
Respec enh. Then at 40 you respec ele if you can handle the drinking costs. Everything changes in the last 2 tiers of the Ele tree. First off,  you NEED the LB cast time reduction, without it you cant really level. Secondly, ele mastery is a fucking auto delete button. Turn it on, and with batching you can get 2 crits. I remember I was instantly deleting players my level at 40 because of it.
---
You sound like my clients :/. Funny how when they do it themselves but they didn’t take one of the many things I’d account for in to consideration (which takes time, hence the cost) and it all goes to shit they suddenly understand.
---
Sounds like he just used a thesaurus alternative for each word
---
Dude was just trying to tell him that it's unacceptable to use that word like that nowadays.
---
I think I watched it about 20 times.
---
'Forgot'? Not everyone has the experiences of comparing vanilla servers and pservers culture together with the 'nochanges' blizzard made to our population cap. That's almost as far away from coming fresh into this game you can get..
---
Ends in an A
---
Rank 3 can be "earned" with doing almost nothing. Hop off your high horse...it ain't that serious. 
---
OP congrats on getting your epic mount!!
---
Can't fix stupid.
---
I only went in with maybe 20 salve. Most of the plants were already cleansed.
---
again. thank you for telling me how to play a game. you must be fun at parties.
---
Couldn't you destroy the one you're wearing, loot this one, mail it to an alt and then restore item on the one that you destroyed?
---
Hmmmm....launching the game from the blizzard app, seems to fix the problem....
---
Got a main horde druid on Incendius, currently farming Ony and MC each week. He's my baby.
---
But I've always wanted to play a pally. I don't know why, but I love pallys so much. I know they aren't the best in vanilla but it was my original main back in the TBC/WotlK days and really wanted to roll one again.
---
However, I know at some point in a couple years or even a year maybe (?) they will release TBC because it just makes more fiscal sense to do that than Classic+. Should I just wait to roll a BElf paladin when that happens or should I make one on another server during my downtime?
---
The only problem I have with this (and sorry for the long post) is that it seems kind of... like a waste of time almost. Like, I would must rather level an alt on the same server as my main so they can have a symbiotic relationship and can funnel gear/gold to each other. Should I just roll something on my main server and wait for TBC for a paladin, or should I just bite the bullet and level a paladin now and maybe server/faction transfer (if they allow that in the future)?
---
The flavor is real. The good thing about lifestealing is it gives a bit of self healing in combat to a class without it.
---
Take a Valium Horde boy, your forehead vein is about to burst
---
I feel like [this](https://tegas.github.io/legacy-sim/#/spell) is a way more useful tool to be honest...
---
Yeah he's right. I mean like, come on.
---
Let me give you a rotation guide.
---
Mage - frostbolt, frost bolt, frost bolt, frost bolt, o there's 5 stacks of winter's chill on boss, arcane power, frost bolt, frost bolt, frost bolt, etc.
---
Rogue - sinister strike, sinister strike, slice and dice, sinister strike x5 slice and dice, sinister strike x5 either ice and dice or eviscerate depending time left of slice and dice, repeat.
---
Same for any other class, there is no complex rotation guide for any class, most complex would be maybe druid since got to toss in form changes or warrior with stance dancing, but those are still really simple compared to even most simple class in retail.
---
How original.
---
He was either born a giant asshole and just enjoys making other people miserable OR this happened to him and now he's out for vengeance against a faceless enemy that just happened to manifest in you.  I can relate.  I'm a PVE player with PVP friends.  I didn't used to kill people but now if someone looks at me sideways I take 'em out.  People are gonna be dicks and it's better to establish dominance than get taken advantage of.  And even jaded as I am I still start less fights than are started against me.
---
I would guess the only way you're going to get this done is to bring several friends.  Call in some favors.  Do some favors if you don't have any to call in.  You can keep trying at increasingly odd hours but given the long spawn time and the great rewards, you're just going to have to get lucky to get it done alone.
---
Are the DM tribute buffs considered a world buff? I don’t usually pick that up either.
---
I’ll need to double check on our armor debuff timings. For consumables I use squid, mongoose, juju power or elixir of giants, mighty rage pot with death wish. Anything I’m missing there?
---
Play on a medium pop pvp server. That's the real vanilla feel.
---
yeah i miss area wide looting...
---
Such a good QOL improvement.
---
But you know... #nochanges
---
Attack Power increases your base melee damage-per-second (DPS) by 1 point for every 14 Attack Power.
---
As a Shaman you gain 2 Attack power per point of strength.
---
So Corpsemaker should be giving you 30 Attack Power, ~2DPS. For a total DPS of ~31.
---
Looks like the Rod is better. It also has higher top end damage, which I think is important for Enhancement shamans.
---
Daaaamn that's unfortunate. I would've never thought to sell mine to a vendor then buy back after I looted this one either.
---
"Wait for them to leave" - "PvP on a PvP server"
---
I don't think I need to comment further on that point.
---
Furthermore, do you really think a random item that drops from Strat is intended to be used to give DHK, which were put in place to prevent people from griefing low level quest hub? Seriously.
---
Lifestealing is 10 less damage for that sweet sustain!
---
As someone who used to twink a lot though, Lifestealing and fiery won almost every duel vs crusader rogues.
---
can people stop being smarted than me?
---
Eh, don't be too sure. Many new classic players from retail have defintiely been weeded out at this point.
---
Dude sorry this is your first impression of the game.. It'll get better!
---
wow, i never knew that. I used to play Neverwinter after i quit wow for a while and was looking for my next rpg fantasy. Played a lot of dnd through out the years so i thought id give it a shot. Really enjoyed the custom quests and the game was fun for a bit. Crazy the developer left the company and they couldnt reverse engineer the quest creator? LOL Talk about getting burned
---
BG's will remove as many horde players as ally players who sign up from the world ganking. And after the BG they will need to travel back to their gank spot for the queue.
---
But at the same time it will also give the Ally players who want to PvP and are currently fighting back a bit instant queues! So world PvP will have less Horde gankers but at the same time no Ally resistance at all. Reverse for servers where Ally is the majority.
---
Also, this is my first Blue BoE drop
---
Thanks for the Google doc! Will look into the rank 7 pvp set to.
---
I had played WoW briefly on private servers in TBC and officially for a month in WotLK. Basically I got a character to 75. I was excited to play Classic and revisit the part of the game I experienced years ago.
---
When I rolled my character, I did some research on the classes, and that was it. I opened the list of servers, picked one, and got to work. I didn't know that servers could or would be imbalanced, or that the demographics would be weird (my server is still the unofficial home of the BR community). I hadn't been following the drama developments, the streamer discussions, the community discussions. Why should I have been? WoW is a videogame, not a lifestyle. Within reason, you would expect to boot it up and have fun without having to plumb the depths of subreddits and official forums to find out that server matters.
---
So it's very strange to come here and read the myriad cries of "you should've known x before rolling on that server." The majority of players in any game aren't thinking that way. THAT'S normal. It's good that some people knew better from experience to do their research on demographics and phase releases, but it's not obvious that you should have to if you're new. 
---
And I really think you're a touch divorced from reality if you can only have contempt for someone in that situation who is not enjoying the current state of the game (especially since that experience seems to be the common one on PvP servers atm). Especially since the main draw of vanilla WoW upon release was how casual and forgiving it was compared to its predecessors. It's not like people are crying that they're getting merced in EVE online, where they might get told to go play another game if they keep whining (and rightfully so). There's no reason to expect that you'll be griefed 24/7 everywhere you go when you buy game time for Classic WoW and roll your character for the first time.
---
The constant large-scale fight going on in BRM on Herod is so great. I know that the Horde outnumber Alliance on Herod but you wouldn't know it by stepping into BRM. They've got control of it most of the time and there have been nights where trying to get into BRD means slowly pushing from the door all the way down to the MC entrance. I love it.
---
Definitely see where you're coming from unfortunately i think something like this would be pretty impossible to arrange otherwise. It was still decided in the heat of the moment as we were battling it out for around 2 hours beforehand to a stalemate which lead to this.
---
You are clearly an Alliance apologist. Just because this fine member of the Horde is a different race they don't belong in this city? You should be ashamed of yourself.
---
I don't think its possible with standard UI.   Maybe some addon could clean it up for you.   Why not just have a separate chat tab for only LFG?    Like I have my normal one which shows guild / party and / say.  then combat log, whispers and then a seperate lfg chat tab.   You can go into each tabs settings and remove what channels are broadcast.   For example my whisper tab only shows my pms.
---
We live in sensitive times.
---
This is false.  I literally did nothing and completed the quest just fine.
---
Lol I get the same shit when I respond to things like you stated above. It’s really not hard, they’re doing the same amount of work posting on reddit, why they chose to go here for an answer instead of google doesn’t make sense to me. I really only come here for answers when I can’t find anything on google or what I found doesn’t make sense to me.
---
gz dude love the journey at the end
---
15 min or following him around just to get ganked by 5 people at the tower....
---
pretending that horde is superior in pvp won't make it happen. alliance has some strong racials as well, and paladins push them over the top.  hardiness and wotf are good 1v1 for sure, but horde is the weaker faction for group content.
---
I’ve made this quest in stealth while a hordie accompanied the NPC all the way through to the destination. No idea why he thought he got the quest, but I killed him at the end and took my reward. God bless undea rogues’ stupidity.
---
Mak gora
---
try again, i got in after a while
---
For the next time just delete one item an then google "world of warcraft restore item".
---
You should find a official site from blizzard and get you items back there.
---
or just reserve SGC lol
---
because apparently everyone should have been playing on private servers for the last 15 years and done tons of research/read every post about what faction every person on thee planet was gonna play in classic....
---
Thanks, I was confused because I don't remember any dancing pirates there
---
What's the link go that awesome spreadsheet of warrior info? The search button is failing me
---
As someone who has played alliance twice, on two different servers, and horde once.  (lvled to 40 2x, and now im like in my 30s on my newest ally character).
---
I would say from my experience that alliance are just way worse at organizing themselves, and actually working together. Alliance is just full of anti-social solo players straight from retail, where a shitton of them just refuse to work together with others.
---
Compared to the horde, where I could just call out in general that I am getting ganked at X spot, and I would get immediate responses in whisper.
---
On alliance, even getting in grp with people for a fucking kill quest is often a pain in the ass, as people so often just wants to play alone. That just didn't happen when I was playing horde, everyone was just more willing to group constantly. Obviously not everyone is like this, but it occurs often on alliance, while on horde it was rarity besides for the occasional AoE farming mages.
---
So no wonder alliance are getting destroyed in PvP, since they often just don't want to bother, and having to type /who and nag at the local 60s to do their fucking job is quite tedious.
---
However, alliance are really nice when it comes to boosting in dungeons tho for some reason. Like they will whisper and ask to boost you.
---
But if Alliance is to recover, we need less of that shit and more killing of disgusting horde scum in every zone.
---
We aren't at war though, killing all of them isn't part of your duty.
---
Blizzard item restore works on DEd items, so you did the right thing. Go to battle.net.
---
&gt; Get satisfied while you can, soon there won't be any alliance for you to kill. Most of them will quit the game
---
Aaaah the same argument used everytime something goes wrong "im gonna quit the game will be dead you'll see", and as always absolutely nothing will happen and you and your salty tears will still be here in 3 months.
---
As always
---
WotLK had decent gameplay, no doubt about it. It's probably my favorite expansion just for dungeon and raid design. It's just a terrible game if you consider all the, not casual, but ease of access crap they added. Going into WotLK on a private server, I got out so early that I didn't even get to raid Ulduar or ICC, because of all the small things in the game that devalued time spent versus rewards gained.
---
WotLK is the true downfall of WoW, despite having some of the best gameplay in the franchise history.
---
If you want exact figures you get like 10-15 rep per, maybe 10% of the original value?
---
And I have some people who never played WoW before who know all the min-maxing, all the encounters, etc.
---
Being new is no excuse really. You can as I said just say that you dont know it and people will help you.
---
westfall has an honor code. PvP happens in southshore / tarren mill, and the raid/warparties stop infront of the flightmasters / civilians.
---
there's also deliberate artrition on the alliance side. if the numbers are too great, people are asked to leave or move on to allow for balance.
---
horde generally are allowed to grief rezzing alliance players in the zone due to faction imbalance, but it doesn't extend beyond that.
---
Addenda to my earlier post. Just now trying to take a menethil boat ride with over a dozen horde waiting in boat cabin with 3 ally 60s trying to take a ride
---
but why?
---
is this a method to try to farm honor with bots?  sounds like incredibly inefficient to me
---
Thanks, I am currently looking at the spreadsheet Blury1 posted.

Yeaaahhh... sounds like you arent a happy person so if you see something that annoys you you feel compelled to complain/approach whatever issue negatively... i mean i get it i went through a phase like that once but you know whats the easiest and most basic thing you can do about what youre complaining about? Ignore it. 
---
What you are complaining about right here is 99% avoidable. Not everyone needs YOUR input. I know this all looks like im being a dick but im sincere about it because i used to get annoyed by the same thing.

While realistic, collision calculations exponentially increase the server load. You could see it in City of Heroes when you piled up lots of mobs or ran out in front of cars; everything slowed down to the point of strobing in extreme cases.
---
Well damn. Forgot all about that thing. Been so long I forgot AV had quests and didn't check those out. Ahh well. Free gold for him if he wants to sell it. It was among the cheaper items I got for him but at the very least he was super excited to see it in the mail.
---
I don't think it's that, but I think a large amount of gamers don't want that sense of self discovery. They're young and grew up with strategy guides and the internet. They didn't grow up with original Pokemon and a friend saying Mew was behind the trunk to Cinnabar. With nothing to disprove it you tried yourself. Prior to easy access knowledge you just played the game. I think people like myself miss that part of wow. Where you really weren't knowledgeable. You just played the game with friends and had fun. But when it launched all the Private server retards showed up and was like I WAITED 10 YEARS FOR THIS TIME TO BEAT THE GAME IN A WEEK!!! And now they all quit and was like, classic sucked. No it didn't, you just played it wrong.
---
But I have my grudges, and all hordes are evil.
---
And if they don't deserve it yet, they will deserve it later.
---
Prevenge is a real thing in classic.
---
No, it's not crazy to expect co-raiders to respect your time by putting in an inkling of research. We are talking about watching a 5-10 minute skarm clip to get a tl;Dr on a certain mechanic or something.
---
The information is so easily accessible in 2019, you'd almost have to be willingly browsing the internet with a blind fold on to miss it.

Classic is a service that Blizzaed begrudgingly delivered because they couldn't keep denying that it was in demand. They don't give two shits about game integrity or the #nochanges mentality. They just don't want to work on it any more than is necessary to keep the playerbase complacent. 
---
That's why we're not likely to see changes to major problems that crop up with Classic these days. Not because of any loyalty Blizzard feels it owes to the nochanges crowd.
---
And I literally did nothing, just watching The sequence and he died.
---
Give it enough time and there will be mergers though.
---
You really think the Classic population is going to stay the same?
---
Almost everything that has played out in Classic was played out across multiple private servers.  In less than a year of Naxx being released the population starts to decline hard.  There's simply nothing left to do for most people because they will not have the gear to run Naxx and will usually not be in a position to ever get geared enough.  Players start looking for F R E S H servers so they can start over and hope things somehow change for the better next time.  Chasing the Naxx clear dream is real.
---
There's also going to be a huge outcry for Classic TBC, and that will likely happen, and when it does that will drain more of the Classic population.
---
Servers will become dead some day in the future, there's not a single MMO out there that has avoided it, it is simply a fact of life.  You're not going to avoid mergers unless you quit before they happen.
---
So that one thing they were trying to avoid that gave us all this other shit?  It's inevitable.
---
Damage Taken only shows the hits that actually hit and did damage :(
---
☺️
---
Agreed, people love it for its lore, but it really went in several directions it shouldn't have.
---
I get what you're saying, and I do the same. However:
---
&gt;  A friend handed me the recipe right about the time I had them all collected.
---
That's a pretty big exception right there. I happen to find a Transmute Undeath to Water that I sold to get my pattern, but in general people aren't going to be as lucky as us.
---
Oh no worries.  It was just funny seeing it get tossed around.
---
I think BGs are much more relaxing than WPvP. You can always just afk at a capture point.
---
You need your epic mount to at least have a chance to run away from others in open world.
---
Totally, but I’m a fan of using every source i can :)
---
I could deal with it if there just weren't so damned many of them. It's like we are mobs on launch day. Wtf blizzard. Cut the damn server populations in half.
---
I am able to get reckoning to proc 100% of the time by using a swing timer and timing it. It's actually very easy to do. Only really useful for leveling but it is worth it if you have the patience.
---
Talent spec for this CoC ZF pwnage?
---
Savage gladiator chest has Strength on it . Strenght is not a hunter stat. You should bloody know what gear is for you.
---
Begone thot
---
Just need to update through Battle.net
---
&gt; People expected it because despite what excuses get thrown out like "layering made it hard to tell" it actually happened before. A couple private servers had this problem when they threw in the pvp system. 
---
here is the issue with this post,
---
ive played wow since the orig beta played consistently from Vanilla to legion, i have never once played on a private server, i have ZERO knowledge of any happening on a private server, i cant even name what a single private server was called.
---
this is not unique to me. this is not common knowledge to the general player base of classic and people need to stop acting like it is.
---
i played on a PVP server in vanilla, i have no idea what its ratio was but it felt fine, i ground out rank 14, i raided and it was never at any point like the current situation on any server regardless of what people keep claiming. I like most people bitching in this subreddit expected something similar to what we had 15 years ago and not some private server fuckery BS. and we are not wrong for thinking that
---
That's not true.. It's increseased miss chance on both weapons
---
gotcha, so worth it more to just grind or buy the runecloth for rep huh?
---
Not completely. I have done this several times. Sometimes he can make it with zero help from a player. Sometimes he dies with zero help from a player. The pulls are not scripted and the damage he does and takes can vary.
---
I thought this was the case but my guild rold me otherwise. Also faster is not such a bad thing for a Shaman.
---
Ashkandi represent! We have a smaller but well balanced community, plenty of both hardcore and casual guilds, PvP in Hillsbrad, and much more.
---
Oh it will. Just at what level of popularity
---
TPS-locked? Sounds like a horde only problem or guilds flasking + gathering world buffs to do MC, probably both. 
---
If you do that your guild is a joke. But hey by all means give away a dagger that would be BiS until AQ to a tank who gets TF next phase
---
Even if you're solo and someone is trying to run away, I usually run up to them (if they don't have epic) and Coex, corruption, siphon life and run with them. Now they go slightly faster than you, so most of the time if they don't want to fight, they'll keep trying to run away.
---
When they're almost out of range, that's when you pop Amplify Curse Coex and reapply dots, now You are faster than them, couple sec later they die.
---
As Fury, only WW is calculated based on weapon damage. DW Fury is the best PvE single-target DPS in the game; you might be pushed into 2H Fury by your raid leader to better distribute gear. Arms is a non-starter in PvE because Mortal Strike takes up a debuff slot with a debuff that does nothing against a boss.
---
LOL!
---
Wasn't spelt with an a the politically correct way to address black homies or am I confusing things?
---
Oh man, triggered the shit outta me.
---
- 1 Get buff and start running north - Die by Horde
---
- 2 Run back to corpse and run back south to get buff - die again
---
- 3 Get corpse next to buff and get buff again to run north - die again
---
Repeat 
---
- 4 Finally get to Fordring to start quest and there is Horde waiting - die again
---
- 5 Rez at graveyard becuase it's way closer to the buff - wait for rez sickness
---
- 6 Get back to Fordring start the escort - feeling good
---
- 7 10 minutes of following and we get outside - killed at the gates by horde failed quest  - start over from 1
---
I'm not lying I tried to complete this quest for several days and ended up having to it at sometime around 4 am to complete when server was sleeping.
---
Stay salty I guess.
---
Except you can’t instantly surrender and allow them to take your cities and leave you alone
---
Sure i'll take a look at that later today.
---
Mount
---
Try going to Damage Taken, then selecting "Timeline" and see if that shows it.
---
pretty sure there is no Item restore for classic?
---
I prefer PvE over PvP, but Warmode is honestly a good chance that Blizzard made later on. PvE is almost the same, except people can flip and gank you when they feel they have the advantage. At least Warmode makes everyone agree to participate from the get-go.
---
I feel like in a guild they take the time and patience to help you and are fine walking people through things. But if you're PUGing there is an expectation that everyone knows what to do and we're gonna do it as fast as we can. 
---
It makes PUGs intimidating before you've done the dungeon a few times.
---
oh shit that worked, just have to COD the small radiant shard back
---
Firstly yes, they can proc if in another stance.
---
Secondly, As fury my normal is to switch to battle to overpower if I'm 40 rage or less / can dump some or stay in zerker if over 40 rage and cooldowns so the rage would be wasted.
---
We have a few alliance rogues usually moving around the flight master or portal location in Orgrimmar. Fun, and worst that can happen is a short corpse run.
---
If you did read what I wrote, can you please provide some logs to back your claims? "Minor RNG" to gain 3k Mana on a 2 min fight would equate 125 mp5 btw.
---
It's not necessary but it can definitely save your ass from dying and losing world buffs. A few of the fights, especially goblin trash, put out serious raid damage so if your healers aren't on point expect some deaths. In one of the more average guilds I played with we would have 2-10 deaths literally every single goblin trash pull.
---
It's funny because at the bottom where the two green lines meet right above Blackrock Mountain, there's always a fucking road block of Horde camping there too. :)))
---
Zugger is our word. But you can say zugga.
---
This reminds me of trying to get the big Deadmines quest on my alt the other evening.
---
I'm escorting the Defias Traitor into Moonbrook and I notice a pile of bones on the path. Right then two undead rogues named Escortfailed and Notgonnahappen pop out of stealth and kill the NPC. Apparently the pair made a night out of this.
---
How much more spellpower would a DS / Ruin lock need than SM / Ruin (with nightfall) lock to get priority for corruption for debuff slot in MC?
---
No lmao
---
You got what you deserved, gnome!
---
Maybe, I’d say look at the beta of Classic as evidence. Horde complained about alliance not queueing WSG and same WPvP problems on a smaller scale. On a massive scale, it looks bad on paper anyway
---
Its the worst:( Good luck.
---
Yes because it’s the one you were wearing :)
---
I assumed you didn’t immediately equip the new one, but bummer if you did sorry :(
---
Yup! I actually found a Cassandra's about two weeks later for 40g then just decided to flip it rather than equip.
---
the majority of the sub is alliance lol, see the alliance related posts compared to horde ones.
---
... ours doesn’t.
---
Sometimes people would rather converse with the people around them - in the online game we play together,  or in forums dedicated to that game. This isn't a single player game, people are supposed to communicate and discuss the game - not just blindly ignore all the other players and act as of it is a single player game.
---
to soon?
---
People are so afraid to communicate in dungeon groups it’s really quite sad.
---
ZF I would guess just farm zombies.
---
A lot more (+-150), using the debuff slot optimizer on the [classic warlock discord](https://discord.gg/C6sHAF).
---
Both. I originally thought it was just to get the training, but we tested it last week and you can't even purchase the mount if you're not Exalted.
---
Yes they have.  IIRC, players just ended up with "Playername - OriginalServer" the way it is in live now with sharding anyway.
---
Narcissists are often hated, and they cannot figure out why.
---
Doubt it's for honor farming, probably just people trolling by letting their bots lose when they aren't playing the game.
---
No hard r
---
JHON
---
Drop your fucking pride it's a damn video game.  There are BiS items for all level ranges.  Get a real hobby you're losing it.
---
Ahhhh, good call.
---
I dont see classic+ or a tbc server being a thing for a very long time. If you want play pally just start an alt on a diff server.
---
Chat shit get banged.  
---
I'm Smudge
---
Shroudmoore is the video taker
---
thats MC solo and yea the bridge jump works. during raid hours there are a ton of horde just camping by the NPC so if your jump is slightly off you are gonna get dotted and huntered to death before you make it to the port area
---
actually last night there were 5 casters standing on the safe spot down there also shooting people. we normally do it as a guild on raid night. last night only 3 people died
---
The main benefit of this method is that the people getting boosted can just AFK at the entrance.  
---
And the way resets are working on classic is the group leader can go outside, reset, and go back in to the new instance while there are still people in the old instance, those people can then re-enter the dungeon at any time to join the new instance, this means if the run takes 13 min, the people getting boosted could AFK for 25 min, then re-enter and see the second pull coming in as they get back in.   
---
here's the gear n spec: [https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/paladin/human/AjwPUAUB8FMFAzUAEFHwUATwgTFMPB0CMyODONhYQYUxVDTiBjkchzkfPB2IOR02Qok2f04rijkeTiwLSb8MLZUNMoIOLiKPSD82OpBCz1jdkQSQNXk](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/paladin/human/AjwPUAUB8FMFAzUAEFHwUATwgTFMPB0CMyODONhYQYUxVDTiBjkchzkfPB2IOR02Qok2f04rijkeTiwLSb8MLZUNMoIOLiKPSD82OpBCz1jdkQSQNXk)
---
They have a dedicated toon that is constantly scanning the entirety of the ah postings. 
---
As soon as an item gets posted at a certain threshold lower than the selling price of the item, one of those scanner add-ons nearly immediately alerts the player that there's an item they need to buy. Of course nothing is illegal about doing all of that, we've had AH scanners for years. 
---
The people that take it the extra step further are those that automate the whole process of buying and relisting the items at the going rate. Automating the process is botting
---
Layering appears to me to be a software solution to reducing hardware costs (fewer servers) and it also happened to make leveling during launch a bit smoother. I don't agree with it but I see why they did it.
---
Vendorstrike: How fucking dare you
---
Flurry axe actually gets beat by bone slicing hatchet if you put an elemental sharpening stone on it since flurry axe is too low level to use one. It’s not worth the gold in my opinion. You could raid 200x with elemental sharpening stones on your bone slicing hatchet before getting close to the cost of flurry axe.

PvP servers are not even PvP. 
---
PvE servers are because you can choose to only participate when its fair. But a PvP server where anyone can kill opposing faction in contested zones doesnt even SOUND fair idk why you would assume it is.
---
I think [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?sle=true#) is the one you're looking for. 
---
If you're referring to the DPS spreadsheet, I don't have a link to that one right now.
---
Oh I did, trust me I’m very smrt
---
Save the mats, the only thing I would sell pre-enchanted would be level 1 white boots with speed or something on them. Even libram enchants i would just sell separately.
---
Thank you gentlemen
---
If this is truly the reason they deleted it then this is probably the soyest shit I've read all week.
---
They need to go out, do something meaningful in their lives or get a reality check or something. Holy cringe.
---
The market on Fairbanks was good for them weeks ahead of P2 (like before they even announced p2), and now its more profitable to sell raw oily blackmouth than a complete FAP.
---
Right, but what you described is a great example of the questions that SHOULD be asked.
---
That's not basic stuff.  Ask THOSE kinds of questions, that's exactly what we should be discussing.
---
WTF server are you on? Ace of the deep woods is 600g? People struggle to sell it for 100g on my server.
---
You might like shadow priest if you like locks but dont want a pet. Other than that mage is great when specced for single target dmg.
---
This is the reason I quit playing classic. Everything is min/max and if you don’t do that then you are a piece of shit gamer who should “uninstall”. Only way to play classic as the original WoW is by having enough friends who are casual to do all the content.
---
Hey, I see this topic being brought out a lot and I made a comment on this last time, coming from a new player too. I'm just gonna paste it:
---
I am a new player, both to WoW and MMOs in general. My 2 cents on how I handle grouping with other people:
---
* Definitely Google stuff that you need to know before playing with other people. Things that you need to know in order to not make people waste their time. Don't want to lookup a drop list for each boss or which items are BiS for you? No one cares. Intend to tank ST and have absolutely no idea of dungeon layout or mechanics? Google. Your PUG shouldn't be forced to put up with that.
---
* ALWAYS make clear before joining/inviting people to your group about your situation. A simple "hey, I'm new to the game and never been to X dungeon yet, are you okay with that?" is more than enough. People who are okay with it and feel like helping you will invite you anyways. People who are looking for a quick run and would prefer to get experienced players will let you know. Then everyone's happy.
---
* Interact with other new players. Add them to your friends list, play with them. Experience the game together. The most fun run I've ever had so far was a 5 new players Maraudon run where no one had a clue of what we were doing.
---
* If you're already in a PUG and people start to get annoyed at your gameplay or feel like you're slowing them down, simply remind them you're new to the game and you are not familiar with the dungeon. Tell them that if they don't like it they should just look for someone else to replace you and offer to leave if they get someone. Why would you want to stay in a group you clearly don't fit in anyways? And you also get to watch them play and learn a thing or two in the run even if you leave. I've said this a couple times and absolutely never got replaced, just be polite and people will understand you.
---
* Learn your role and Google some basic stuff about it, like talent specs or stats you should be prioritizing. No one cares if you have BiS gear or not, but don't join a group as a dps that deals zero damage because of wearing completely random stuff... It's just the polite thing to do.
---
* If a group you joined is clearly toxic to you and you're not having a good time in it, simply let them know: "hey guys, I think I'm not fitting in this group and I'm not playing the way you'd like, I think it's best for all of us if you just find a replacement for me" and just leave after they do. That's it. It's a game, if you're not having fun, don't go on.
---
hurr hurr hurr
---
Lol I don’t even like trump I was just answering his question
---
On my server horde raids regularly run back and forth along this path just to catch stragglers. 40/60 server.
---
Ally in a nut shell. Just lets horde hang out in IF.
---
Some people value conversations for something other than data transfer. They *could* Google it, and would as a last resort, but would much prefer to get the information by chatting with a real person. The interaction is as much a goal as the information they are asking for. 
---
So for those people, saying "just Google it" is both missing the point, and replacing the hoped -for positive interaction with an (unnecessarily)  negative one ; a double loose.
---
So you, being information focused, think they are wasting your time, while they, being interaction focused, think you are being a colossal dick.
---
FWIW my natural inclination is much the same as yours - I've just studied the enemy :)
---
Aren't both of those High Pop.?  Not sure what you're worried about and can't really predict the future.  High pop realms today are massive compared to real vanilla...
---
Welcome to vanilla 👍

Telling people in a 50+ dungeon you don't know the dungeon is a good idea.  I've never seen anyone kicked over this, and it can help a ton.  Good on you. 
---
If you need to know what gear you should roll on you are probably safe to ask, 96% of the time people will give you an honest answer and not give you a wrong one out of self interest.  You're very likely to be playing with one person who knows your class's loot at time of drop if not at start of dungeon since lots of people are either experienced or have alts now.  Or, you can just alt-tab to your BIS list if it is a 50+ dungeon.  You should be fairly safe to roll on any upgrade &lt;50 if you have at least a passing idea of what stats/procs your class should use (i.e. please rogues do not roll on Hypnotic Blade because it is "good dps").
---
This is the inherent broken system the PVP system has.
---
THink of it this way, would a Master Sergent in the navy tell another Master Sergent in the marines to fuck off?  NO, they wouldnt its combined arms.  The navy MSGT is trying to coordinate shipping lane securement for the marine MSGT and their ships access to a beach head for an assault.  What essentially is happening is one alliance is competing against another alliance player or one horde player is competing against another horde player.  
---
PVP is SUPPOSED to be faction against faction NOT about a person of the same faction against another of the same faction.  Thats just antithetical to wartime strategy.  This is why bracket formation and the like is necessary to maintain the faction vs faction aspect and focus around that.
---
Have you considered making friends?
---
Its not a bug, its a feature
---
Yeah sure mate, I like flurry with deathbringer as it procs a MH hit again but we have yet to have ele sharp stone recipe drop yet. I have a bsh in bank but figured I'd recommend it to the OP
---
Nope, start from loch modan
---
Most people who are new either say things that are absolutely wrong or don't say they don't know. I have issues with new people in raids not following instructions that make or break fights but never speak up when I give time for questions before and after. Very frustrating
---
I won Savage glad and the warrior I was with was super excited for.
---
Some people are just unreasonable.  Don't blanket it as if everyone is this way.  On Sulfuras it doesn't even seem to be a majority.  More like specific instances of a single person just being jealous or triggered by their own bad luck in the moment.
---
I would say that it didn't work in MoP is because not only did they merged servers, they also introduced sharding. So not only do you see new people from the newly merged servers, you'd also see a bunch of people from completely unrelated servers. Plus region wide group finder, raid finder and custom groups. So it's pretty obvious to me how, with all of those changes, a server community never developed.
---
&gt; fuck skarm 
---
Yeah...I'M the negative one here...
---
Is it too much effort to read a post before commenting? That is not what I am saying.
---
So, probably globally again as with Dire Maul and honor system, i.e. EU gets battlegrounds on tuesday as well, even though the weekly reset day is wednesday for us?
---

---
Threw this together for you real quick.  
---
The lines were getting hard to see with the white background so i had to change it around a bit.  This does include reduced coefficients for renew rank 1 and 2 for being below level 20.  I'm actually a bit surprised they overtake the other ranks so quickly despite of that, but the mana cost is soooooo low.  
---
Just keep in mind anyone reading this that using downranked renew is extremely situational and unless you know exactly why you're doing it you probably shouldn't even bother.
---
Took me 18 kills on the orc to get mine. Other guildies got it within a few orc kills
---
big lore facts
---
It's like Ali players think there is some secret bond where horde and alience like each other and the horde are just there for free farming. NOPE. I've played both factions, and its ALWAYS the same, when I see my enemy, I attack.. It's rather sad to say it honorless to....kill your enemy.
---
Fill up your group with other leveling players at the same level as you, that will give you Group XP bonus which will offset the penalty from having a 60.
---
People who min max, want that 20 ap. Who cares if it's better for other classes, if it's also good for you. Pug dungeons isn't the place to be loot councing gear.

You call me negative and shit on skarm in another comment...I'm starting to think you're projecting a little bud.
---
We see a single 7 second clip. The fact that he kills the guy specifically in a sea of people, in the HEART of Ironforge, indicates he's not there accidentally. Stop being so thick. I know you play horde, but even you have to admit that this shows how dominant horde are on this server. He wasn't fighting off a mob of people, he had the time, and motivation to target an individual nowhere near himself, and it's not like the gnome was even attacking the horde mage, so you can't use that as an argument.
---
can you guys recommend an addon for making name plates more visible. i'd like one that makes the health bar bigger and easier to see, perhaps one that can also alert me to when a party member has 20% health too with some sort of audible noise? and lastly, the ability to move the "party" window slightly more center in my screen. thank you!
---
But the other one is still on front page right below it?
---
The PvE/PvP thing is valid. But the gear stuff...most gear problems can be solved by talking, even briefly. Usually it is fairly obvious what classes a given piece of gear is good for. Hunters are notorious for rolling on nearly all loot because of their flexibility on stats...if you want to avoid the stereotype, maybe talk about stuff a bit. If someone's running a dungeon over and over again for a certain item, it may be better to discuss rolling on it in advance.
---
thats cool :)
---
Only real proc you care about is OP. I personally dont use an addon for it, I just watch to see if they dodge, its pretty obvious, then you simply make sure youre not over 25 rage, switch stances, op, switch back. Should be noted that revenge shares cd with op so you never want to revenge unless youre tanking.
---
2h fury warrior (probably the 2nd tank). Better dps, and more reliable buff uptime than shaman.

Lol dude I know what I've played and I know what I'm seeing. I'm talking about eventually contested zones where control goes back and forth. This is what my experience was in original wow. This is not the experience now. 70 30 faction imbalance. The fact that you are trying to convince me that this was somehow my fault for not understanding the rule set is funny as hell.
---
Killing as fast as possible is important, a buff can be dispelled every gcd, so every gcd an opposing faction member is alive is risking losing big buffs like only or tribute buffs.
---
You’re saying the ones using numbers as evidence are the one making the grand assumptions? And then you go on to make assumptions about how people will behave? People are just telling you that there are more horde than alliance overall, therefore horde will have longer queues.
---
Yeah but for this one you just hold onto his feet as he Ravager spins himself to glory
---
I think they will kill classic and allow you to come to shadowlands anyway.
---
1. Thats fine I am horde. I actually thought this was a great way for alli to get the horde gankers and shit off their backs. 
---
2. There are already countless ways to do this and if people are greifing with it - theres a report button for a reason.
---
3. as Blitz pointed out - these are only usable in goblin/shared cities. How often do you get in fair pvp scenarios then greifed there? Never? Cool
---
I what I meant is irl politics is banned in this sub.
---
Huh...that's a really interesting line of thought.  Thank you for that observation!  So perhaps in some cases what I'm inclined to see as laziness is actually someone reaching out for social interaction...
---
That's food for thought.
---
At least you did what needed to be done: You yelled into the ether on reddit. Now all we must do is wait for sweeping changes to arrive.
---
Im dps, the armour value on the puece isbt relevant so lobg as i play correctly, why limit myself to objectively y worse pieces because a rogue is salty his class is overpopulated?
---
Hell eye of rend for instance is strictly better for warriors even
---
It's most definitely a bug. Not being able to pick up loot is a bug.
---
The "Unique" aspect of the item ONLY APPLIES to EQUIPPED or QUEST items.
---
Yeah they are very niche.  Renew's coefficient makes it one of the most 'mana efficient' spells to downrank in the game.  I updated the graph at other's request to show the efficiency of the various renew ranks.  This down include a reduced coefficient for rank 1 and 2, but their mana cost is so low it hardly matters.

agreed
---
I had to do this quest at like 4am for this reason.
---
Fiery/life steal beats crusaders in most 1v1 duels I've seen.
---
Or a level 1 priest as their Mana regen is fast enough
---
Because that everyone is a class officer and running the loot council.
---
Not likely, I mean spell batching is in the game and was removed for a  reason.  
---
This is classic, not retail.  
---
Though this is something that probably could be changed, seeing as item recovery allows you to bypass it to some extent, would make it a bit easier.  
---

Rank 5 healing wave spam the entire time. Never stop casting. Ever. You will do a bit of over healing but you will also have massive throughput the entire time. "If" you hit submerge phase, pop mana tide 5-10 seconds prior and let the 5 second rule take effect and then chainheal rank 3 through aoe.    
---
Hope this helps! Best of luck!
---
Blizz/Actavision likes $$$. 
---
Classic made them lots of $$$. 
---
BC would make lots more $$$$ (if they leave classic servers alone)!
---
TBF, back in vanilla, we had pvp battles on pve servers.  The few I remember were mostly Crossroads and Tarren Mill/South Shore.  Granted, these were rare and mostly snowballed from someone killing guards at a town but they did happen and they did get big.
---
Bear trinkets you should target because they're pretty much the best pre-raid...
---
* Smoking Heart of the Mountain (BoP Enchanting craftable)
---
* Mark of Tyranny (Rend Quest)
---
* Distant/situational third:  Mark of the Chosen (Mara Quest) - effective when you're getting hit by 3+ mobs only, otherwise the other two are WORLDS better
---
Cold Basilisk Eye only slows your target down, it doesn't speed you up.  This actually reduces your rage, making it harder to tank.
---
The two best tanking trinkets are MoT and SHotM by a long shot, that 4.6x armor multiplier is insane.
---
I can't speak to pvp...i haven't put any time into that.
---
For an enhancement shaman the weapon has a pve usage, so not strictly a pvp weapon for him to be fair. 
---
I don't think the meme spec variable is relevant. You got to remember this is not 2005, everyone can clear the content, you don't need to min/max every raid member.
---
He said just before booting up whatever modern, realistic military shooter is in flavor this month.
---
Dang, even on Skeram those guys never make it into the bank. You guys fucked up.
---
Hey! I could level with you, Im playing on EU both horde and alliance, and has a 60 already so i can help us out with bags and such, if you dont wanna pick a new server :)
---
Ahh, yes....baiting. Doesn't work for me with spell batch so far. I get CSd well after stop casting
---
I think quite a few guilds will struggle on BWL for a while.  There are still people just hitting 60, plenty with shit gear, queue boss has slowed a lot of people from filling their pre-BIS.
---
Becasue you're Alliance and it's bad for Alliance while it's Pre-BiS for Orc Warriors. Only Deathbringer is better but GL getting that easy.
---
Inside the cities too!
---
Mainly healers. I could be wrong, but nothing I've read or done has shown that it's possible for a Warrior to keep threat off a similarly or better geared Mage or Lock going all out on AoE damage.
---
Grab up both mitigation and threat sets. You are going to be mixing and matching stuff based on the fights and your group. I was mostly in threat gear and doing great till we started 20 Manning molten core at which point I needed to use more mitigation gear for longer fights.

Disc priests stacking all stamina are very hard to take down. As others in this thread have said 4k+ HP can be achieved relatively easily with some Necropile/Dreadmist gear and maybe a piece or 2 of T1. Do not worry about +healing. If you are Dwarf Fear Ward &amp; Desperate Prayer are very powerful. You have enough HP to make a stealthed rogue blow all their CDs on the initial stunlock and you can keep R1 SW:P on them to prevent restealthing. Mana burn is also extremely effective against casters while using bubble + shadow protection + dispells + renew + desperate prayer to survive. Trinkets to break poly / stun should be heavily prioritized over stam / +healing / mp5 trinkets. I am not the world's best PVPer but just from dueling outside IF and chatting with opponents we are much tankier than other clothies. In groups everyone loves you and will do a lot to protect you. Downranked Flash Heal is your friend
---
Toxic much?  The chest piece is very usable for shamans.  And considering that Resto has piss all for damage, slapping on a set of enhance gear is about all they can do.  Savage gladiator is not the exclusive purview of warriors.  It's fucking mail, ffs.
---
Are military styled shooter games like CoD disrespectful?
---
Hi, I'd like to subscribe. 
---
Can you link your spec?
---
You seem like the edgy kid, who is like.. no mom.. its not a phase.. i am in love with my little pony! /s  
---
Jokes aside, why do you hate it? because people play what they want? and abuse it.. if you dont like it go recruit more people.. or go horde and have ur way? Crybabies do not belong in pvp too baad you chose it yourself.
---
Based solely on other answers you have received in this thread, I'm going to have to say yes. I am very helpful.
---
Laughs in "Rune of the Guard Captain"
---
Mining, yes. Blacksmithing, not really. It’s much better to go mining/engineering for the average person.
---
You sound like a child. There are plenty of pvp servers that are perfectly healthy.
---
Your close to (depending on group comp) for the stats chance on hit trinket from Mara. Have to kill 5 khans (inside and outside). Super good comp to level. 
---
Chance on drop from the water ele boss in Mara also (nature resist and click effect to remove a poison).
---
Yes, but it wasn't addressed until after vanilla.  There are plenty of people who don't want any sort of non-vanilla change regardless of how minor or quality of life it is.
---
1) Why would horde be triggered by this post?
---
2) LUL this sub is NOT horde dominated. I'll refer you to the 20-a-day posts complaining about horde.
---
That's why you're being downvoted. You're off topic and incorrect.
---
Then have a conversation on your own time, not at the expense of other peoples.
---
The leader of world of warcraft was quoted widely on news sites saying that, "I hope you have finished leveling in hillsbrad foothills!"  That was the queue that you should not have just finished leveling in hillsbrad, you really should have finished leveling.  Otherwise you are fresh meat, ya scrub.
---
The OP might need too
---
&gt;People have complained about their class/role/server type and how it impacts endgame...but in my opinion they should have done a google search before spending hundreds of hours leveling a character.
---
There are some pretty big holes in this line of thinking. As far as server types, what happening now isnt pvp. No amount of "reaearch" could have prepared you for this. Maybe it's been this way on servers but it wasn't in vanilla. 
---
For the classes and roles, most of the "limitations" are player imagined and enforced. Someone ran some simulation and decided class/spec combo XY was 2% worse than XV so now you're a meme spec for playing XY. New players shouldn't have to actively avoid certain classes/specs because some "theorycrafter" decided it wasn't the most optimal. I think it's sad that players ate being told to research these things instead of just letting people play what they want.
---
All rumours, but man it would be sweet
---
Can confirm. My bf got me into WoW, I'm almost 30 and have never played any videogames before, so I have a loooot  of questions. It's disheartening to receive such a reply when I'm not just trying to get some information but also trying to engage in some interaction with other players, since playing with others is a big part of the game. Of course it's not for everybody, but coming from a complete beginners point of view, it could make the difference between going on playing or losing interest.
---
Probably a rare finder addon that works with Azuregos to alert you if he is within range.  
---
As for death time you would have to be near the boss, or have the same addon as someone who was near the boss when it died, so not all that reasonable. DBM might do this, as it lets me know when guildies get warchief blessing or ony buff as a timer, but I'm not sure if its implemented for world bosses.
---
Hey! Can’t decide whether to main Warlock, Shaman or mage. Looking for a class that focuses on pvp. Preferably something that will be good in future phases too. So which class is better at pvp, and which one feels more rewarding and fun to play?
---
HYPE! lol jk i know ppl on this sub hate this game no matter what haha
---
I use Elvui’s built in nameplates due to it allowing me to adjust the size. I also use real healthID to get the HP/100% to show.
---
And.. The cost is there to earn money...
---
We had a collective 11 MC clears 2 weeks ago for nothing but 1 Earthshaker too. Then they buffed the rag weap drop rate and since then:
---
On the 7th week, g1 &amp; g2 both for a Spinal Reaper
---
8th week, group 2 got a BRE
---
9th week, group 1 got 2 OEBs AND a BRE.
---
This week mate. It’s coming.
---
This is cool. But imo you get one shot and if you wipe, the other raid can take their shot.
---
you are a moron and you clearly know nothing about this game. stfu
---
IMO it's not wrong at all to tell someone to just google simple questions. "Teach a man to fish", and all.
---
Tons of questions that get asked ingame can be answered by just googling or searching wowhead. "Where does this drop?" "what's the best warrior dps spec?" "how do I get to (location)?" etc. etc.
---
The fact that you even asked that question is disrespectful.
---
Twice? Nah way more. I'm not good at internet humor, shit happens.
---
Please ease my anxiety reddit. I'm currently level 42 after starting on launch and I'm worried about everyone having left by the time I get to actually raid. But at the same time, I don't want to rush to max level because I've enjoyed treating the game like a proper RPG again with professions, quests, dungeons etc. It's really difficult when I see people running around with their epics and mounts and hearing about the awesome drops they get in raids etc!
---
I know a lot of people say that MC will still be relevant when Naxx is out etc , but was that really true in private servers / back in actual Vanilla?
---
yes it is , specially whit 2 hunter pets near the pull
---
I mean I am pretty damn addicted to Classic as well, but holy shit are people seriously offended that much by a word that's obviously applied a in a humorous context in a video game? How gullible.
---
What's next - no humor allowed?
---
Enough with this fucking soy PC culture being shoved in our throats every where we go irl and now gaming.
---
It's getting too far. These people need to fucking relax a little bit.
---
How much does this bis #$%! even do?
---
I bet you can just take the 4th item, aka the one that did not even make it on the list of bis and next best two options, and still only 10% below the other guy who has all from the list.
---
Such crazy effort for so little gain.
---
Most PvP servers are "high" population with the exception of a few "medium" servers that are still more populatedthan a "high" population vanilla server was.
---
This is the #1 issue imo. The world simply isn't big enough for this many concurrent players in a PvP environment.
---
Yeah fuck people for being unaccepting of ableism.
---
"organic wpvp" is what most people who rolled on PvP servers were wanting.
---
That couldn't be farther from what we have now though. Bored 60s in full raid gear camping every flight path, quest area, road isn't what I would call good pvp. It's just mind numbingly boring/frustrating. I curse my friends everyday for rolling on a ganking server. 
---
I would suggest PvE, but if you're set on PvP, make sure to go to the winning side.  Chances are the losing side's population will only get worse and you'll be left with no one to run stuff with.
---
ye, i see where u coming from m8, probb not the best choice of words.
---
Some of us don't get internet humor. I will never get it, so prepare for much more of this.
---
Mark of the chosen for bears is not that distant if a 3rd imo.  You can get armor capped without both trinkets, and you'd be hard pressed to find a better piece than +300 hp, +1dodge/crit, +50ap
---
That is what happens if you fuck up badly enough, yes. And they have. 
---
If we'd had a reasonable quantity of servers from the start, all of this would have been far easier. I mean, we'd still complain about something, because that's what wow players do, but it'd be better.
---
But at the same time Blizzard was telling us that we dont actually want Classic. They werent taking it seriously and likely expected it to just fizzle out. After Classic came out and they saw how many people actually started playing it their attitude towards that probably got changed up.
---
This is common sense. Not food for thought lol.
---
You might want to google something about how different humans can think differently to you.
---
The reality is that you are going to increase your raid DPS by helping your fresh 60s farm gear.  A warrior going from a 60 blue to savage gladiators is a negligible increase.  Running Strat/Scholo/DM for equally as long will turn your quest green dps into a 60 blue dps.  That will increase your raid dps more than any single very rare drop.
---
Stop farming BRD for your one missing BiS and help your guildies gear up.
---
I really can't tell if you're trolling. Maybe it would be easier to ask what things aren't disrespectful to you?
---
K E K
---
Meh, it's fun..
---
Been hanging out at STV and the salt from Horde when they get ganked back for a change is sweet! Been chased by lvl 60's all across the map for hours several times now.
---
That being said, I'm a bit salty only getting Sergeant rank after farming 18k honor there last week.
---
Lol the g O t O r Et a IL spam always makes me chuckle. Like dude you beat me solo with a 5 man backing you how you gonna shit talk
---
Reddit wow is more hard core than the
---
average wow player so regardless of how good your argument was, this sub has closed ears.
---
Ultimately trying to convince reddit is a waste of your time, you should be trying to find a guild that works for you.
---
There are people who brag about parses in mc..
---
Dude relax: funny clip, innocent joke. Just type ahah and post some whining video where you get killed in a pvp server and complaining about it and the UNPREDICTABLE phase 2 as most alliance players do. Then wait for my zug zug comment.
---
I would tend to agree that it *should* be based on opinions and not merely basic factual questions...if what someone wants is a genuine dialogue, asking a basic fact question is kind of a bad approach. 
---
However, by analogy...when you're on a first date, you shouldn't be asking basic fact questions, those are uninteresting discussion...you should be asking questions that probe who a person is and what drives them.  The second kind of question builds connection, the first is a way to not get a second date.  However, most people struggle to get beyond the first type of question.
---
Anyway...I agree, we should be focused on better dialogue, but I appreciate the psychological discussion we've reached on this...wondering about underlying reasons for basic questions.
---
It's rare for it to be safe to open with charge in endgame dungeons. Most pulls require you to shoot a mob and line of sight the pack behind a corner. After lining a pack, I typically Bloodrage &gt; Battle Shout &gt; Sunder skull target &gt; Battle Shout. At this point I have AoE threat stable enough to Berserker Rage and then dance back to DStance. I run with semi-purpled healers and DPS, and this lets me hold threat so easily it honestly feels like tanking on retail.
---
If you are farming HoJ or hoping it drops, it is 100% on you if you don't talk about it prior to zoning in.
---
When BGs come out that will start to change. Also, not everyone PvPs. Some of the biggest servers are RP servers.
---
There will always be new players and alts. It might get harder to find a group, but every piece of content has someone else wanting to do it too.
---
Lots of midgrade mining materials sell for a decent amount last I checked because of how many people are leveling engineering and/or spamming bombs. 
---
Heavy/Solid stone in particular.
---
&gt; Form your own group
---
Biggest piece of advice that no one on reddit or in my guild or in lfg ever try and follow.
---
Currently pyroblasting
---
usually the other raid attacks you during the fight. we fought eachother over it for 2 hours before this.
---
That’d be awesome! I haven’t played WoW at all since WoD because I stopped playing with a(n) (ex) friend after he hit me, robbed me of over $5000, committed fraud using my name, and yanked my credit score after it all went to collections. And we’d been friends for over 10 years since high school. I had no idea he was like that.
---
And I just never was able to find a battle buddy to get back into WoW with me, and I can’t play alone. So finding a new battle buddy and/or group would be awesome! :)
---
Step one - Aquire disguise
---
Step two - Dispell disguise from alliance
---
Step three - Sit back and enjoy
---
I think it is faster, b/c if you bring your lowbie along, you have to run around picking up every single trash mob on the way. I'm pretty sure this way, once you aggro at the end and start running back, you can just run and the trash will follow the crowd. I could be wrong.
---
Plus, don't you have to jump down to exit at the back and you can't get back in?
---
Oh my god who the hell cares Peter Griffin meme
---
please stop playing this game. people like you are total idiots and ruin it for actual good players.
---
is it viable to just save those 800g and just farm AV rep when is out to get the AV mount?
---
This made me lol IRL very hard
---
all is possible , the real question is :  you really need this to tank ? NO.
---
Doesn’t this break rule 7??
---
How come my meme gets removed but this one is allowed
---
hmm i have very little experience with druid so i don't really know about good leather pieces. 'Force of will' and 'naglering' are both quite good though if you aren't using them already
---
shut.t
---
The guy above stated he has full raid BiS. Butche doesnt have BDS because he doesnt know what BiS is. He alao admits he doesnt even know how much hit % he needs. This is what happens when you blindly follow bis lists and dont learn what stats your class needs. 
---
Obviously if your still working on lionheart , get that first.
---
When do you think your station will be ready?? :)
---
??? You don't have to reply to a Reddit post if you don't want to so how is this in any form wasting your time at your expense? You're the one that took the time to reply....
---
Definitely had to go back a few times for this, even as a rogue.
---
Thanks, exactly. Just to clarify I wasn’t concerned about equipping it, but using its active. With the active it would be op and I would farm it immediately. But in combination with a one hand and just for the stamina I am not seeing it’s value and will go for TCS with int and for an axe with 25 as secondary once it comes out
---
I believe I painted a clear picture that you still managed to miss
---
At least we dont roll deep with the roleplaying neckbeards. I'd rather be on the team of normal people who have actual lives outside the game tyvm! :)
---
The others are too. Multiboxing means you're feeding several accounts the same command. And because you do need an extra account to do so, blizzard doesn't mind. Just means one person pays multiple subs.
---
What's the haps?
---
Yeah!  Like, come on!
---
I'm not angry, I'm just asking the person who said it's as bad on Horde side if he's been in the same situation as OP (and myself).
---
Good drivers know shortcuts.
---
You can say that not many people posts, that the fact posts bashing phase 2 are now popular is not ultimate truth and it's hard to know what the silent majority think. I can totally agree with that.
---
However how can you affirm that the overwhelming majority likes it? how do you know? I mean I totally know that watching the subreddit mood isn't ultimate truth but those are hints like the fact that this phase (you agreed) is more for hardcore players and silent majority tends to  be more casual and therefore is probably hating it more than the average active users around here.
---
I mean have you an argument more than "trust me"?
---
The food for thought isn't "wait...people think differently from me?"
---
The food for thought is that the above comment prompted me to have to assess whether those differences justify the behavior that I have judged here.
---
As someone else noted, if people want dialogue...maybe we should be having that on substantial issues, not basic ones.  But perhaps I'm asking too much of a demographic that tends to have fewer social skills.
---
These are the thoughts...it's not news that people are different, the question is whether those differences should change my opinion.
---
Kinda feel like you lost the high ground with this response.
---
You murder those sneeky little bastards. Do it quick so they don't suffer...or kill you.
---
And those people are wrong.
---
Keeping a game intentionnally broken is not fun for anyone.
---
Pro-tip: Next time start off with this kind of comment which is far more constructive and detailed instead of a needlessly rude comment attacking someone for "trying to sound smart" by daring to make an attempt at explaining a cognitive bias.
---
Your initial comment is kind of ironic considering this post's context of expecting people to have an innate understanding of something. 
---
People make mistakes. It happens. Don't be a dick about it.
---
We didn't know when DM dropped at first.  Saying 'you'll get your trinket in the next phase', when it could be literally months away is just being a dick.  "You'll get your dps plate in the next phase, stop rolling on leather!"
---
Well it’s functional now, but I don’t have a monitor anymore and can’t afford a new one. So whenever I can find an affordable used one online. I’m hoping within the week.
---
Got banned last time so had to
---
You're gonna want an auto quest complete addons eventually for this
---
As a horde I actually dislike that guild have only run into aholes
---
Ah, don’t know much about the horde side of things. My IQ isn’t low enough for me to think they are a viable faction so I’ve never rolled horde.
---
I got ganked about 4 times trying to do this quest, most on the way there at least.  
---
Fucking Human rogues and Gnome mages.
---
It's a quality graph, you're owed some pride for it. Makes it so much easier to explain the value of downranking while also showing off when to actually change out spells.
---
Thats cool :)
---
you spent time writing all these paragraphs to claim your personal anecdotal experience of playing horde vs alliance has any value in understanding the demographic of each faction.
---
Faction population ratio is what matters, the underdog faction has to roam in groups or sit in sanctuary zones to be safe, and the '\[opposite of underdog\]' faction can freely roam the contested zones except for when they meet the underdog group.
---
Ooof. People craft them for free on my server. Just need mats
---
I’ve quit trying to get it because I’ve never seen it drop and I’m more scared of this scenario than I am just never seeing it lol
---
Yeah! What do you use for voice chat?
---
I bought both axes, then my epic mount, then farmed Lionheart mats. I would not recommend doing that.
---
If I was to do it again, I’d absolutely get epic mount first. Makes life waaaaay easier and farming mats/gold way faster. I’d go epic mount, Lionheart, then axes.
---
No doubt! And I'm super jealous!! Just awesome that he got their first!!
---
i assumed it was a joke but mods on any gaming subreddit are absolute nerds so you never kno
---
Gotta love a good speculation bubble.
---
((this has been done since release in 2004))
---
What mod is that with the prices?
---
I feel like we couldnt be friends.
---
But like, I don't want him to be the best man at my wedding. I'd just like a synopsis on w.e mechanic and then go about my day. Call me crazy.
---
Investors make the decisions, not Blizzard. We'll see.
---
I have never played wow, but I want to give it a try and join on classic. I checked the links above, but I am still not decided what to play. 
---
In all MMORPGs I play DPS, and usually I enjoy ranged DPS. I would like to join Alliance and I was looking at picking between Hunter and Warlock. I don't have friends playing wow so it would be great if I can play solo, but also easily join random groups for dungeons and raids in the future. It would be nice if the class is somehow beginner friendly (since it is my first time playing wow), but also stay relevant in later phases.
---
You just need your +healing gear to be an effictive holy pala in MC and have the +10% intellect tallent in holy tree.
---
This song is dope AF. Great choice
---
Try a hunter twink, you can gear those up pretty cheap and they are the best level 19 twinks. I think rogues are good 29 or 39
---
I think you answered your own question. The info is all out there and a vast amount of people either expect a player to know it from experience or due diligence.
---
&gt;I'm not sure why you would want this macro
---
it doesn't really cost anything to put a stance line before every spell that requires specific stance. Atleast that's what i did on my warrior.
---
Bare minimum yet some people pick a BiS list and use it as a stick to beat everyone else with.  Without checking to see if their BiS is actually correct or has substantial caveats.  If a hunter trusts the BiS list that says HoJ is for him, he is going to be surprised by the salt from the warrior.
---
PoM Pyro is ableism now? Melee class victim complex at a new high.
---
zug zug
---
Yes you are wrong for thinking that, that's what he's trying to get thru your thick head. 15 years ago you and 99% of the rest of the players probably didn't know Horde racials were so much better than Alliance's when it came to PVP. Now, we know. 65H/35A balance across all PVP servers was predictable af.
---
I would go fury dual wield thrash blade from the mara quest line and vanquishers sword then replace vanquishers once you get the quest line in Scholo for Mirahs song. If you sold vanquisher's then I would just buy a 1h green sword with strength on it around your level and go from there.
---
Im partial to zperl, though there are many options available.   When i played paladin (in retail) i had 2 setups i could load on the fly.  One with my nameplate near the center of the screen and party off in the corner when i dps.  Another that lined all 5 name plates left of center so i could heal while paying attention to mechanics. 
---
I believe you can set it up so the name plate flashes or glows when someone takes damage.   I personally have that all turned off to reduce eye clutter so i can focus on pew pewing with my hunter.
---
While I agree, that doesn't change how angry the #nochanges people would be about anything.
---
I was gonna say it doesn’t get better at 60, but then I remembered I’m a warrior. Judging by your flair, you may have a better time.
---
Why doesn't the description of battle shout say anything about threat?
---
Does the fury talent increase the amount of threat?
---
Thanks, been through xpoffs forum and posts already. I was just wanting to start a topic here on what people think as an alternative for TCS, since more people have stated to make big twinks. Would you go for Massive battle axe of the monkey (5/5 agi and stam), MBA of power (16ap is max afaik?!) or MBA of agility (agi)? I certainly am overthinking it :D but that’s what min maxing is more with big twinks in Classic.
---
I'd wager they don't really have any reason  at all other than having seen it on a list that they do not even understand.
---
Understand as in knowing how much being all bis actually  improves them vs. being all '4th best choice'.
---
Frankly i stopped hunting for bis as soon as i come accross a endlevel blue that's just "adequate".
---
Sure sire, go ahead and farm for your Cape of the Black Baron that's twice as rare as my cloak from the houndmaster guy in BRD. That extra 6 Str are totally worth all those hours.
---
I'll just continue clearing MC with &lt;40 players, seems as if we do not need the extra 12 AP on me after all.
---
I will never wear non-plate on my warrior, i'd rolled a Rouge if I'd wanted to wear rather.
---
There is no way the horde will be able to move their tanks trough the forest of Elwynn, we don't need heavy defenses there.
---
We just wanna see Orgrimmar! :P
---
Discord :)
---
The buff required to start the quest also disappears if you A) Mine anything, B) Pick my herbs, or C) Open a chest. And there is a chest spawn directly behind the quest start...
---
Can the Iron Counterweight go on that? I think that's the best enchant right now for bear tanking.
---
9-14 gold each on Gandling EU depending on what day of the week it is. It's nuts.
---
Be fury prot, use dense dynamite, have force reactive disk, ggs on ever losing threat again even against even the most geared players.
---
Why do you care about the top end damage of your weapon as an ele sham? It's mostly a stat stick. And it's actually good that this weapon is so fast, more melee attacks = more procs. Plus it has no internal cooldown
---
Lemme preface this by saying I'm in no way a fan of jokerd but I was really interested in his 1-60 run. 
---
That being said he was joking. Method even got flack for using that clip as proof he was cheating on their race to 60 stream.
---
Right on. I’ve got that on there. Just keep in touch and hopefully we will be playing in a few days!
---
I got flue. Super bored at bed the whole day: got to post something.  Plus, i constantly get ganked on way to dungeons, never posted about it. And believe that is kinda frustating as prot warrior :(
---
More math than the other side of the debate is providing.
---
So with lvl 60 going to Lakeshire and killing lvl 20ties is pvp for you ?
---
Ironically, the song *Disrespectful* by Gashi is not, in fact, disrespectful.
---
A lot of people are hoarding them to sell and assuming they'll go up but it's going to flood the market and crash the prices. The best time for you to sell would be right now.
---
Late response but even a handful of warlocks per realm competing for this spot makes it obsolete instantly.
---
Lionheart  helm usually totals about 800g, and lasts you until AQ. If you don't get that, then just save for epic mount.
---
Awesome :)
---
So I like Mark of the Chosen, but you won't hit that armor cap pre-raid...and you likely won't hit it for awhile if you're running appropriate hit/threat gear.
---
The problem with Mark of the Chosen is that it isn't up 100% of the time and in raids where you're usually tanking 1 thing at a time, it's not consistent enough.  If you are in place where you are armor capped, don't need the resistance and haven't had to sacrifice threat to get there....then absolutely use Mark of the Chosen to replace one of the two that are generally better.
---
That said...get all 3, I did.
---
What do you define as healthy? 50:50? 55:45? 60:40? Worse? 
---
In my opinion, anything approaching 60:40 is unhealthy. Let's see how many EU servers are unhealthy and how many are healthy.
---
Out of a total of 28 servers, only **5** would be considered healthy, the other 23 are unhealthy.
---
Data from ironforge.pro: https://ironforge.pro/servers (as of Dec. 4 2019)
---
10/10 working as intended.
---
Me and four other guys waited for more than 45 min to get our turn, even had to run back and reapply the disguise. When we finally started it an undead priest showed up and dispelled our disguises. So you, my horde friend, should sit down and take whatever resistance we underdogs can throw back at you, the overwhelming force.
---
I'm on a basically even split server (especially at my level range), and this shit happens all the time.
---
Depends on server pop and the mob in question and how lucky you are. 
---
Example: Crusader. 
---
Avg cost on my server (pagel) 150-200g
---
I have invested 6 hrs of grinding the tower and have had ~120g in grays/greens and cloth.....
---
If I had been grinding humanoid mobs for 6hrs I would have made more gold (my avg grind spot for ogers gives me ~30g/hr) so in the 6hrs i would have made ~180g.  This is a lazy net flixs/hulu bing watching Archer grind 🤣
---
TL:DR for me I just haggled the dude selling it from 200 to 180 and called it a day.
---
I mean they can research, and then have interactions with people if they still have questions. Which is a way better use of time, then you wanting someone to teach you stuff when you have 0 foundation.
---
It's shooting in the dark, but from a profitability standpoint they'd be silly not to do it. 
---
Just look at all the revenue they've generated from Classic. It's a game that was already paid for, so their development costs were practically non-existent and yet it's generated as much revenue as a regular expansion. Why wouldn't they continue that business model as long as they could with later expansions as well?
---
I’m not a good enough healer to do the benediction quest.  I have followed several guides, changed my name plates, added weakauras, and everything else.  Still can’t do it. Failed 6 times yesterday even with full buffs. 
---
Not a question, but just needed to get that out.
---
Darkmoon faire is live on Monday? Wow, need to get farming that rugged leather for the kits!  So want that trinket on my resto shammy
---
it takes 53 agility to get 1% crit as a hunter
---
&gt;no-lifers, are the players that log into the game and literally wait for enemy players to show up -- they're the ones guarding entrances to dungeons all the time
---
So.. Basically the only players left will be the horde?
---
You mean the blood elf paladin mounts from retail?
---
What you should get is the intellect tallent, and the +12% healing from holy light and flash of light. I have raided with this setup for past few weeks and it is perfectly fine. 
---
This will only cost you 14 talent points. If you really wanna tryhard you pick illumination, thats 20 points. Imp wisdom, holy shock, holy power isnt really needed for MC.
---
What is happening is that Battle Shout is a buff.  Giving a buff to a player creates a fixed amount of threat.  Giving a buff to 5 players gives 5 times that amount of threat.  This is why raid paladins are using Blessing of Kings to hold threat.  Not because the ability itself has a threat modifier, just the act of using it creates threat.
---
OP is a huntard who cant use google you hate to see it.
---
extra accounts=extra money for blizz and as long as they dont break the rules, why would blizz do something?
---
“Enjoy it while it lasts!!” : token upset ally redditor
---
Elvui would be my go to answer. You can turn off what ever you dont want to use and has the options to move your buffs/debuffs were ever you want.
---
Yeah, but I played on the minority faction everytime, including on my horde character. And on my horde character I had no issue getting people out to PvP or do group content.
---
And, yes its my personal experience. But I had pretty much the exact same experience as alliance on two entirely different servers.
---
yes, you cannot enter through the back entrance, only the front entrance.
---
Just keep denying theres a problem. When seasoned pvpers across multiple games are calling foul theres probably something that needs to change. This isnt war it's a video game that will thrive or die based on the decisions the devs make going forward. This comes down to rushed content, poor development timelines and optimized content clearing. 
---
Your statements make it very clear you haven't had to experience the countless corpse runs and you refuse to even attempt to see why people see this as an issue. Your "solutions" seek to further spread the faction balance gap which is probably the most confusing part. You actually want empty servers? You want people to stop playing? Your logic is horribly misplaced.
---
Either way I've wasted enough if my time trying to show you the logical reasons why this is a game killer but you choose to ignore them. Moving on.
---
As soon as we could get 40 in to MC we cleared it 1st try and have since then, some of us were pre 60.  We are a mythic raiding guild on Sargeras so yes we have been clearing MC fairly early.  And yes we have had very good luck, we have had 2 brut blades drop, 3 perd blades and I think we had 3 viskags in a row, not lying.
---
https://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/sargeras/V+A+N+Q+U+I+S+H
---
Cant seem to get much actualy gear outside of paladin and warlock stuff
---
devilsaur, epic mount, lionheart
---
Or he knew that if he wouldn't do it every Horde in the area would AoE check for you. He wanted it to look like he is doing it for any Horde by passer and this is how you replayed him in the end.
---
Uh yea, usually when I'm offered a choice of 2 things, both of which I don't understand, like you were at the server selection screen, I'm going to do at least a cursory google search or ask someone who does know.
---
so you guys are using discord to talk to the opposite faction?
---
All the BiS lists I saw are sorted in phases and needing HoJ now or taking it before when it is easily replacable would be under my bare minimum I would require of randoms.
---
I have done it in a weekend many times on private servers, but that's spamming games all day. A lot will depend on queue times.
---
Well a server transfer isnt going to require human interaction.
---
Yeah, I was thinking I may be able to get away with something like this:

---
**Introduction**
---
**Illicit Pastry is a PvE focused progression guild that is focused on establishing a core raid group &amp; bringing together all guildies to not only enjoy the content of classic, but to have a great time with one another. The GM and current core members are made up of former players from a successful Vanilla guild on Mannoroth called Swords &amp; Staves that cleared ALL raiding content except for the end of Naxxramas before Burning Crusade. The GM has experience in effectively leading raids since 2005, having formed S&amp;S in late 2004. We love to joke &amp; have a good time, but also to make progress in the game, and we aren’t afraid of direct criticisms that make us better players.**
---
**Goals**
---
**We are currently partnering with allied guilds to clear MC &amp; run Onyxia mostly PUG with the whole intent of recruiting. It is our goal to establish a stronger ‘core’ group of raiders and even expand our Officer list to support raid leading and guild development. We are also happy to take on newer players that are willing to learn and can commit to our raid times. As we build our guild back to victory, it is a great opportunity to improve yourself, your gear, and your skills in the game. Our ultimate goal is to (soon) be raiding all in house and we would love to see you as a part of it.**
---
**There is absolutely a home for players looking to play socially and just hang out, so please don’t be shy. Feel free to hop into Discord or send us a tell in game to chat with us further.**
---
**Expectations**
---
**An ideal guildie would have a light sense of humor, a positive attitude, willingness to learn, progress, and hang out with fellow guildies, and to be available on the two nights a week that we raid.**
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
**Wednesday and Thursday – Eastern Time – 7:30 to 11:30**
---
**The end times may vary ever so slightly, but will firm up as we move towards being 100% in house.**

Yeah, I only know about rogues though.
---
I have this theory that blizz saw the imbalance early and rushed patches to help. Some horde will reroll when they see that ranking isnt gonna happen, and there is nothing to kill. More will reroll if there queue times are astronomical. 
---
Maybe they just rushed patches to simply get to bgs faster so that players will balance themselves before needing more drastic measures?
---
Let's see. He's got some ZG/BWL gear, he is holding [Lok'amir](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19360/lokamir-il-romathis), the [ZG caster trinket](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19950/zandalarian-hero-charm) and he's using [flasks](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13512/flask-of-supreme-power).
---
There.
---
That was glorious. A buddy and I did something similar to this last month. Paladin with the right gear is a twink machine. 
---
Suggestion: get moveanything and move your loot popups somewhere less intrusive.
---
People are shit in general. Me included but at least I'm cute af.
---
Yup, just a normal day on Skeram
---
Thank you for the laugh homie
---
This, dead servers can only blame themselves.
---
Hoist on their own Petard.

the only thing being overestimated here is your poor english.

Some people are just extreme, anti-social losers.

Kromcrush is extremely balanced pop wise
---
Best enchant is to use the DM weapon with counter weight, since that makes it better than warden for now if I recall correctly from the druid dicussions
---
Pretty much, but if they aren''t there it will still feel empty.
---
I really think this kind of behaviour should be discouraged somehow
---
DejaClassicStats
---
My friend.
---
They have done nothing to help.
---
I play on kirtonos and saw dozens of posts during the first batch (we were already badly imbalanced) of new border xfers. We probably gained more horde than alliance we lost.
---
They shoulda not allowed any horde to xfer and prioritized imbalanced servers regardless of pop for xfers to balance shit out.
---
I am not sure what gear level you are talking about, but if you are relying on BS to hold AoE threat, and using it for half of your GCDs, you are gonna have a bad time.
---
**The best AoE threat generator is the TAB key on your keyboard**, and making mouse over macros for Revenge. Install a nameplate addon (KUI or ThreatPlates) that will modify the color of the nameplate based on your threat on the target.
---
Pallys that want to PvP and then bubble hearth when they are about to lose 100000% deserve this.
---
How exactly do bonus weekends work? Should we expect this first weekend to have a bonus? I want my don Julio's ASAP, how long should it take with or without a bonus weekend?
---
Skinning+ herbalism/mining until 60.
---
I had this exact thing happen over the weekend. Both group members got the reward and I did not. 100% I turned in and was at the correct step.  I haven’t even tried it again since. So fucking demoralizing. Submitted a big report just because but we all know Blizz don’t read that shit.
---
It's not and I expect the same thing. I don't understand why some people don't' take the time to even research their classes in detail to know what they're doing and how best to play.
---
When LOS pulling i'd suggest pre popping zerker rage just before the mobs reach you and go def stance, this way you get the most rage possible during the beggining of the pull when all mobs should be on you. You also dont risk losing out on Rage due to stance dancing for zerker later in the pull and avoid the initial damage taken by having to go zerker stance once all mobs are on you.
---

---
time to /gquit
---
Even if you go from thorium point, the straight line is the worse of the worse way to dot it, it's about 8/10 deaths longer, than doing a run-around (where you'll still die)
---
I’m not saying to drop the shaman. Nightfall should be applied by a warrior as it’s the most reliable way to keep the debuff up and you still do better dps.
---
I don't know what magical, backwards server you're on where tanks are plentiful and healers are sparse, but I'm sure everyone would like to know, cause that's not the case on any server I've ever been on.
---
This is why people hate the game right now. This attitude is what people are complaining about
---
Thoughts and prayers
---
I never tried divine favor, but might try it. I rather pick imp LoH instead of the fear res. I never really had use of it in the wpvp I did. Every time I had to use trinket for it. With trinkets and bubble you are pretty fine against cc.
---
Yoink it?
---
You on one of their shit lists for some reason?
---
BiS is BiS. giving someones BiS to a class for whom it isnt BiS as priority is dumb as fuck.
---
He is stacking consumables and has much better gear than you.
---
R...
---
Repost?
---
You obviously don’t play on a dead server if you think that complaint holds any weight. Who cares about having your name when there’s no one else around for it to even matter.
---
You are about 1/3 the way to raid, congratz! So at this pace, it will take you probably around 6 months more to hit ding and get decent gear to raid. By that time I expect AQ to soon be out. MC doesn't really stop being relevant before Naxx, so you should be fine.
---
I rage quit quite often and canceled my subscription twice xp
---
I'm sure plenty of people just jumped into it because, you know, hype and streamers, but it's also a 15 year old game that lacks, you know, 15 years of MMO refinements.  
---
Ultimately you can always reroll pve or cancel.
---
In other words, your "friends" are toxic lil campers running around felwood, or camping towns.
---
Pretty sure both sides lost a lot of morality in phase 2
---
You make no sense. I'm saying if you want to PvP at ALL, you have to join groups, and there is a chance someone else gets you a DK. That is completely out of your control. There's nothing "fair play" about it. It's completely unfair to the person who gets the DK if they had nothing to do with the actual DK.
---
&gt; Some people value conversations for something other than data transfer. They could Google it, and would as a last resort, but would much prefer to get the information by chatting with a real person. The interaction is as much a goal as the information they are asking for.
---
For me, that "conversation" is just a sign of them being lazy and disrespectful of other people who have already put in the time and energy to learn the answers to those questions. If they want meaningful conversation, that's not the way to do it. I'm more likely to have a negative view of such a person which will affect any future conversations we have - this is true in real life as well. I encounter people like this at work.
---
I was specifically talking about camping the boat for hours on end just to make people’s lives miserable.
---
And I think your feeling is shared by a lot of people but I don’t agree. I don’t feel like I’m supposed to fuck people over so they don’t have any fun. I don’t think griefing is something that should be done, even if people do it and it’s allowed by the game. 
---
That’s really the thing I think. It’s great to fight and win, and I think totally fine to KOS the other faction on sight. Corpse camping and flight master killing (and camping the flight master) is just shitty.
---
Again, I know a lot of people don’t agree with me but I try not to forget that there are real people on the other side too. I’m all about in-game fighting, but making it a point to totally ruin someone’s experience is not cool in my opinion.
---
I did it more as a record keeping thing.
---
"these types of players" you mean the ones that bubble hearth out after the pick a fight? psssh they deserve to get ganked after pulling a pansy move like that.
---

BiS for a 39 Pally Twink.  My friend made a holy paladin, and I made a rogue.  Not many people play 39.  We owned BGs, just the two of us.
---
UBRS: Red Dragonkin.  
---
LBRS: Wolf or Spider  
---
BRD: Oversized Red Hound  
---
Strat/Scholo: Both have the undead horse now.  
---
DM: An oversized lasher.   
---
ST: Green Dragonkin
---
Yeah. I’m confused on how being an “elite player” would help you out of getting 10v1 ect.
---
Like others have said, supply and demand
---
Most of us tanks have no need for dungeons and especially not pugs since guildies are almost always available, so something has to make it worthwhile to take on the most ungrateful role in classic
---
Hopefully some good feral fcs will stream WSG.
---
On private servers there are/were amazing fc's that were ALMOST impossible to catch if they had skull off cd, trinket up and faps/lips.
---
You can renew them and you may see that I sometimes did it in the video, just didn't want to spam renew on all the peasants to coserve some mana by using low rank heal/flash heal instead
---
n...
---
no?
---
That's also me as horde though and it has little to do with pvp. There just isn't that much to do in the game right now.
---
or does and raid logs hardcore
---
there's literally only one pvp realm where ally outnumber horde.
---
One server. Every. Other. Server. Is 2:1 Heavy Horde bias
---
Sucks to suck.
---
Been searching for something like this!! Thanks.
---
What do you mean by "these days"? Like  speaking your opinion is just suddenly a thing now? And not I dunno, the entirety of the human race?
---
This is what its like flying into TP
---
So salty, I would welcome more alliance. By the way, if you talk about annoying you should talk to the hordes that farm the Menethil boat...
---
Arcanite reaper was 80-20 alliance to horde. A nice little bit of horde came over and we are at like 60-40 now
---
Then you have a comprehension problem and not an information problem.
---
Use holy nova instead of that flame bullshit guides recommend. 3 or 4 kill everything instantly. Also use mana potionsm use smaller rank heals because mobs have low health,  when peasants are close to the quest giver turn back after a few renews and start moving back fast to dispel the Purple disease fast.
---
Make Azeroth Great Again!
---
This is wonderful. Fully expected some asshat Mage to start AOE'ing. Glad to see there's at least some respect among enemies.
---
every group i join im gonna overheal 2k hps then call the tank shit and leave the group.
---
Prot Pallies use Blessing of Salvation.....
---
I hope so haha. I didn’t know warlocks were good at pvp until recently so I’m happy about that at least
---
Hunter and Warlock are both solid choices. I would make the decision based on what class archetype appeals to you the most.
---
Horde are camping the straight way since it's what everyone is using, they don't want to leave that place to chase 1 or 2 straggler since it meant missing a lot more people.
---
Will you die doing the runaround ? Yes probably 2/3 times, instead of 15 (just to reach BRM doors). But it depends on how hard the straight way is camped, on my server youprbably do 5 meters between rez, so it's incredibly inefficient
---
Sorry, realise I sound like a douche, orthopaedic shoes correct how you stand
---
It's not that serious fam. I've never played before. Once I tell people im a true noob they're nice.
---
I did it successfully my first attempt but it bugged out and wouldn’t let me talk to Tirion. Both my group members got it fine. It’s like Blizzard said “fuck you, you’re not allowed to not hate this fucking quest.”
---
Its not bad on a PvE server? Also they gave the phases of what and when stuff would be released before the game even came out. If you knew it was coming you should of rolled on a non PvP server? *shrugs*
---
In classic, do bg's give exp?
---
Are there any tips for maximizing your gains when raiding with a suicide kings system? 
---
Our guild's finally put MC/Onyxia on a stable farm and I'm currently pretty low on the list, with no drops to my name (combination of my luck, drop luck, and a currently limited holiday schedule for no-lifing it). I just don't want to constantly be feeding on the un-wanted scraps of the higher-geared players if at all possible.
---
I demand I be permitted to ride the bear while in bear form.
---
I mean, I don't mind a tank taking a few trash/non-needed drops to pay for a repair bill. Especially if we've had a couple wipes, that shit can get expensive
---
It’s a video game man relax
---
aah okay. Thanks.
---
Tank bis lists in many cases are god awful.  I feel really bad for the people who follow them and get gear like Onyxia Blood Talisman.
---
Same story for us horde on RPPVP servers.
---
doing some feelycrafting here, but I'd think runecloth assuming you can find some humanoids to farm uninterrupted. After the first turn in it looks like 50 rep per stack. My guess is you could get a stack of RC faster than you could do 3-5 quests.
---
Yes we get it the game is dead, they’ve evolved from camping every single flight path, boat and questing zone to just camping the bank and innkeeper in IF after the alliance have quit in droves.
---
The game is dead, blizzard doesn’t give a fuck, just unsub and tell them why
---
I think you should go with a hunter or a mage.  Warlock is great, but its a more indirect damage class with damage over time spells.  It might not be a ranged dps like you played before.  Mage or hunter are the much more straightforward ranged dps classes.  
---
It you want something with more flavor though, then go warlock.  Warlock is like no other dps class in the game.  It's very unique and has such a fun and interesting toolkit.
---
If you do pick hunter, then just be aware that you don't get the ability to have a pet until you complete the level 10 quest, and before that it can be a little bit of a drag and slow.  Once you get your pet though, your leveling experience will just explode.  I would say that hunter is the more beginner friendly class than warlock in my opinion.
---
I love bis lists. Some pieces would be so hard to get without them. 
---
And they also give us nice squishy fury warriors in pvp. So much leather
---
Someone rode off into the sunset, naked.
---
Both are great choices for a first class and have high soloability. I play Lock myself and I lovvveee my Lock, very powerful in world PVP and I can solo pretty effectively. But man there's just something about a hunter, it's like the perfect starting class and has a few tricks up it's sleeve that warlocks don't have. The toughest part about a hunter is level 1-10 (which isn't that bad, you just dont have a pet yet and that stops hunter from doin normal hunter stuff) and will take you like 4-6 hours to get through, after that though you"ll love your toon.
---
Because the game has been around for 15 years and Google/Twitch/Youtube is a thing.
---
If you're going to put zero effort into learning correct class mechanics/stats/gearing etc and just learn as you go that's COMPLETELY FINE!  Just so long as you understand that 90% of the rest of the population cannot be expected to want or be forced to pick up your slack.  
---
Playing at your own speed does not mean that everyone else is going to agree to slow down to meet you should that be the case.
---
It's really that simple.
---
they tell this on last blizzcon so dont be pussy , i dont want TBC but they want.
---
MV is camped on most servers (even in the morning). The only diff being that the morning run will take less death runs because there isn't as many people camping the bridge to BRM. But during peak times forget about MV. You'll get killed 3-5 times just trying to get to the bridge, and the GY is so far away, it takes just as long as if you were to go TP to BRD.
---
Most people I know go from RR, but even then you'll have 1 or 2 people camping the entrance of BS from RR during peak times.
---
You are so edgy!
---
Took me 9 attempts on my priest to complete it, had a great variety of bugs happen ranging from daddy never coming to the rescue to quest failing halfway down the castle hall, to our grand boy despawning mid fight with 90% hp.. on my warrior it took one try, everything worked as it should and went smooth. On my priest I had 4 answers to my ticket about it and all four was a new copy paste saying to /reload .
---
Same thing on thunderfurry.
---
Lol, I've wiped my group on him before. Bastard has those beast fearing grenades that he likes to toss on your pet. Having a feared pet with dash up (+80% run speed) is almost guaranteed to end in disaster.
---
I actually do this, yes, my mistake.
---
By "these types of players" I meant the people who are camping IF's Inn to catch hearthers. I think I was pretty clear about that.
---
We can also criticize and make fun of the people who pick fights and bubble hearth out - we can criticize everyone and anyone who deserves it. However, what you're doing is "Whataboutism" - Not really interested in participating in that convo
---
Lastly - I didn't see the beginning of the video, I can't tell who "picked the fight" - but I imagine if the pally did, they probably picked a 1vs1 fight and didn't try for multiple, eh? 
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism)
---
If they're doing it as a favor and have no reason to be in there it makes sense.  Otherwise no.  Thing is they have the highest repair bills and have the hardest time farming.  So if they help you run a dungeon that everyone needs but then instead of farming it can make sense.  Otherwise you guys could all just pay then 10g for their time.  BRD is a long one too.
---
ye1l specifically said AR is easily the best 2h outside of rag weapons. That statement is false, because OEB is better than AR and isn’t a rag weapon. I’m well aware it isn’t comparable to Demonshear or AR because you can’t ‘farm’ it, but that doesn’t make the above statement any less false.

You missed the re-discovery a month ago.  Prot paladins are applying Blessing of Kings, because it is the cheapest, to the raid.  Repeatedly.  By buffing 10+ players every 1.5 seconds, you create such a massive amount of AoE threat, it is almost impossible for any dps to pull off of you.  I'm not talking about what buff Paladins use on themselves but the threat generation from buffing other players.  This only works when you have a lot of the same class.  If you have a very wide class representation, this method doesn't work.
---
Warlock.  
---
Warlock later on the in the game, if you stick with it and get geared, is just an incredible killing machine in pvp.  Mage is great too but will be more difficult to gear and more difficult to master.  But once you get the "end" of the classic experience, Warlock is an absolute beast in pvp.
---
As far as more rewarding to play, that's very personal.  Mage is fun because you can do so many things in pvp and the gameplay is very dynamic.  Both are going to be a little on the boring side for pve, but most classes are since you have a rotation that you just repeat over and over.  Mage and warlock rotations are about as simple as the get in raiding.

Literally no one expected it to be as bad as it is. Read any of these posts and multiple Vanilla veterans will confirm this. it's bonkers
---
Feels better man, blizzard aint gonna do shit its working as intended.
---
It’s funny, this game. That’s ridiculous man.
---
Shield slam will be more threat at your gear level. You admit not knowong fury prot rotation. You have likely been scuffing your shield slam rotation as well. Shield slam can easily hold aggro over 900  -1k dps on alliance side. If your dps aren't pushing 1k+ dps fury prot is 100% pointless.
---
You dont bandaid poor prot rotations by going fury prot and fucking your utility.
---
Noone should be fury prot and not hit capped  Its just bad.
---
Warlock did something really special for me. I'm not great at wow, but I'm not bad considering I watch all the videos and use a ton of keybinds and macros effectively. Warlocks are so strong in world PVP that I find myself chasing down anyone and everything even 3-4 levels above me pretttty confident I can kill them. "If you can fear it, you can kill it." - Some wise Lock
---
Dude you're wrong so many times here idk where to even start lol
---
You both are getting off track with that though!
---
Yesterday I noticed one guy LF tank for Live strat fro like 30 mins. I offerd him to tank for just one sphere. He declined. I saw him looking for a tank for another 40 mins. Okay.
---
Two corrections:
---
1.) This is 99% Blizzard's fault. Horde can't be expected not to compete for honor. It's a systems problem. 
---
2.) https://imgur.com/undefined

Rogues aren't the top of the food chain in vanilla

Make a third just for LFG and flip to it when needed, if you use leatrix plus it has a feature to hold chat content for longer than the stock setting so you wont risk losing content in the other tabs while you look for a group.    Don't think you will find any other option unless some chat addon does it.
---
Hmm as in you don't think the talent is working? I suppose disorient wouldn't matter if I had blessing of sacrifice up, which would also help break fears sooner.

---
Toxic? Probably.
---
The Horde ones, while disappointed at the level of imbalance that hit their server, are still chugging along and finding ways to keep their standing decent.
---
The Ally ones, having specifically rolled Ally on heavily horde-favoured servers, are loving life because although they can get camped every now and then, the ranking seems much easier (when you're actually not shit at the game)
---
There's like literally 1 server that is heavily Alliance favored. And you call me ignorant.
---
&gt; he’s not the most intelligent one out there
---
Which is super fucking weird to see from a guy who was known for finding very obscure technical tricks (have you seen the OG Incredible Warrior Tricks? The shit he does in that video is absurd). He famously popularized the “charge in combat” macro, you know the one that birthed the “clever use of game mechanics” meme.
---
And yet that guy and the numpty we see in this clip are he same person.
---
Mak’gora
---
Not OP but it's easy as fuck math: That thread is only using auto attacks for it's """data""" it totally ignores overpower, ww, sweeping strikes, and mortal strikes. 
---
Yeah fury beats the shit out of arms in an auto attack contest, but can fury pull 3 mobs at level 30+ and cleave them all down at once? Na.
---
"wow classic pvp vs pve server". Date the results back to before WoW Classic started. Most sources/threads did not predict this sort of shit currently happening. 
---
If I would've known, I maybe would've rolled PvE (for the first time ever).
---
If I recall, the unyielding maul (or whatever the 2h mace from DMT is) is actually better than warden staff for tanking, at least until those weapon enchants come out.
---
Presumably that's a dozen addons packed into one. Which is the relevant one for those bars?
---
WHOOSH ;)
---
Unless those newbies quit from phase2, or wait until their guild runs them through AV.
---
Then again I feel we're over looking the fact that Alliance gets to play a lot more battlegrounds then horde does. Plenty of alliance will only want the exalted gear and them quit.
---
Must’ve missed it, what happened on this one? Just looked like someone killing two mobs then looting a green.
---
I suspect you’re not getting camped otherwise you’d know the shorter path is significantly faster.
---
society man
---
Lol clueless. Absolutely clueless.
---
LOL that's like a 150% damage increase from buffs. There's your answer OP
---
But you arent hit capped. Get hit capped in prot before even thinking about going fury .
---
&gt; I'm almost 30 and have never played any videogames before, so I have a loooot of questions
---
That's understandable, most people would. But why would you not head to the internet first, where you can get much better, more through answers and you'll have time to read, digest, and figure out the information on your own time? So then when you hop in game you're not lost, having more fun, and can actually have meaningful conversations with fellow players now that you know at least a little bit of what you're talking about?
---
It's still silly to have only 10 bars available. This is how my UI looks
---

You reposted within 10 hrs, pathetic.
---
overheal doesn't creat any threat you smart man :)
---
/r/WholesomeWoW
---
There are many pulls in endgame dungeons that have too many mobs to tab through to keep threat off your healer, who's constantly generating threat on every mob in range, while you're limited to one per global with tab targeting. I'm thinking particularly of Strat. On smaller pulls of 2-4 mobs, once you've established threat with a few BS's to hold aggro off the healer through their initial heals, you should indeed start tab Sundering instead. Thank you for your contribution.
---
Same with mine, i play on incendious and Xander and triendra both craft them for free
---
I do this and it helps.  Im not 100% but I think that if you already have bs that it doesn't cause as much threat.
---
I click off bs, especially if it was from another warrior, then do mine and it seems to draw more threat.
---
This was also one of the ways I would keep the twin emps in place when they blinked and let the lock get threat.
---
If you are going into large aoe pulls, the best thing to do is use oil of immolation with some type of thorns.  If someone can't buff thorns then get the crystal spires from ungoro.  If you are running strat, then use holy water.
---
One of the other things I am working on right now is an aoe threat set, which will have as much dmg reflection as possible.  So naglering, shield spike, Razor gauntlets, taste of flame, Demon forged breastplate, drillborer disk shield, and Cloak of Flames (not sure if this is out yet)
---
There is no such thing as balanced PvP in Classic. Rolling a warlock or spriest already invalidates any sense of sportsmanship.
---
Check atlas, 3, 4 &amp; 5% on Eye, BRE and SR respectively: now 12.5% each. If not, by almost all anecdotal accounts it’s been increased.
---
We had BRE AND Perds this week in g1. In the past BRE and Perds were on the same loot table and you couldn’t get both.
---
Tanks reserving gearing items, orbs from strat live, mining in DM:E are common. I think there's been a recent spat of "tanks get all greed items" judging from some reddit posts, but I doubt that'll last.
---
I would never heal for a tank asking that. Greed item trickle is my only income as a healer many days.
---
Very true. After 3 40 min death runs to Dire Maul I've taken to killin horde questers with my lvl 31 alt in Hillsbrad Fields. 300 kills in 3 days.
---
Phase 1 is not long gone, it was only a few weeks ago. Guy made it sound like it's been impossible for years.
---
And yet this is the same guy who popularized the “charging in combat” macro back in he day, which is the whole reason why “clever use of game mechanics” is still a meme today.
---
Pretending to be dumb is now the standard brand for 90% of twitch it seems.
---
That he was ganking people, got chased, killed, camped for a few minutes, took rez sickness, and died again? We weren’t there for a hour big hoss.
---
Lets ignore all the relevant stuff and keep making stuff up! GJ!
---
nvm i saw your other comments :)
---
Reaching out could be a strong way to put it sometimes. Sometimes, people prefer to ask others for help even when they don’t require a social presence in their lives. Perhaps they know that in this particular scenario, asking another human might be more fruitful than doing a google search.
---
Ah, the the good old strawman. Not going to answer your question, since you know what I meant before you typed this comment.
---
Classic will go on for more than a year (very likely at least and might be much longer) so there's plenty of time to play. Most content (in particular early raids) will stay relevant and still be done for a very long time and there is plenty of time to take part in it.
---
So that's why the pet was so fast...he definitely had that up lol.
---
Cry more about PvP on a PvP server. BGs will come out soon enough anyways, it's just a temporary experience. No one gives a shit if you quit from being camped, it happens to everyone.
---
Imo blizz saw the servers struggling to function with properly balanced large scale wpvp, and, realizing there was nothing they could do to easily bandage the problem, decided to do nothing to help with the growing imbalance, instead opening up free transfers from tanking servers to actively balanced servers, without any kind of faction limitations in place, to try to tip the scale enough on those servers that large scale wpvp would not be logistically possible there either. I hardly ever see people complaining about server chugging on here any more save for the one or two ultra populated servers on raid night. Outlandish theory, I know, but they have directly or indirectly completely avoided having to address the server stability problems until AQ comes out. I like to believe malice over incompetence despite it rarely being the case.
---
wpvp is fun when it's mostly fair.  Yje gank squads and mass corpse camping is aids though.
---
Wow, you're right!
---
Every horde corpse camping in a group of 10 or more, is sure set to get that tier 8 (I think?) gear. Good on them! 
---
If my server dies due to Alliance leveling, I'll look at the toon I Spent days leveling and gearing and think, "Golly. At least I was able to help that raid group get 30 honor. that sure was worth wasting all my time with this."
---
What he is saying is that they Changed it later and in Vanilla it's working as intended so it's not a bug.
---
Because it's literally ruining the experience on the vast majority of PvP servers and it's just making me miss private servers that actually had balanced factions? Do you really think I'm the only one complaining about this? Do you never look at the forums or this subreddit?
---
It's literally killing Classic and all you Horde players will be standing around like idiots on empty servers 6 months from now wondering where everyone went.
---
The biggest thing you lose from fury prot is tactical mastery. If a taunt resists, you cant swap stance mocking blow or intercept.
---
You should be hit capped in either spec. And you aren't right now. 
---
Send me your logs if you want real advice on rotation.
---
True. What class did you roll?
---
Has any other mages noticed that the dogs in DM: N suddenly have a much larger attack range? Usually I can jump off the ledge after my ice block ends, but now the dogs tear through both my shields and basically insta-kill me.
---
His butthole.
---
If crossrealm was within the same server type only, sure. Overall the population is very close to even.
---
I think it's less about people not leveling as prot and more about not wanting to drop gold on a lvl 36 epic that will be replaced by a lvl 60 green shield.  Most warriors do keep a shield in their bag.
---
The buff duration is being refreshed, which counts as a new buff.  This is how paladins do threat in raids, reapplying blessings during fights.
---
I confess, I was one of those complainers then. It might have been the sheer number of shamans around, but it seemed as if I died to frost shocks/windfury procs a lot for a time. This mostly went away as I got raid geared. In retrospect, I probably just wasn't running enough sta for pvp yet.   
---
I am going to enjoy not having a queue for BGs, though.
---
The games been out 15 years that’s why
---
Levelling as Ele is a nightmare before lv40 when you get the -1sec cast time on LB/CL talent. After that it's really fun, very strong in WPvP and is actually the fastest in raw mob-killing speed, even when accounting for more frequent drinking (you will need to drink after every 3 or so mobs).
---
What I did is level as Enhance to 40 then swap to Elemental. During your 30s you can start picking up some Int/Spellpower/Stam gear, a good shield, caster weapon, etc. (Most of this stuff you can get throughout SM, including Mail pieces you can save for lv40.)
---
I totally understand that. We still move to a separate channel to discuss, this allows the raid to keep moving, the main tank keeps things flowing. After the boss goes down, loot is linked and trash starts again. Discussion takes place with the officers and the random raider in that second channel while the rest of the raid keeps going. An item is linked and anyone who wants it shares what they currently have in that spot. So we take that into account as well.
---
Hope your guild master sees this post! If not, &lt;Nightshift&gt; on Sulfuras US is always recruiting!
---
Telling someone to "google it" is the equivalent of saying "thoughts and prayers" when there's tragedy. You're not actually helping at all you just want credit or to be acknowledged when literally just saying nothing would be better.
---
Remember how everybody wanted "community" from classic wow? and wanted to be able to talk and interact with people? That's part of it. Some people just want to talk to someone, an actual human being. I could literally sit in my room all day googling every question I have about every topic in the world but being able to have a discussion with someone, and bounce questions and answers off of each other is the basis of human interaction.
---
I personally am a student, I study everything and i'm constantly trying to learn as much as I can about topics including all of the little details in wow. Sometimes I still ask questions that I probably already know the answer too, because having another opinion never hurt, having conversation and opening up a topic for discussion never hurts. If I wanted to sit and grind 150+hours of leveling with a google window open i'd go play skyrim or the witcher or any other single player RPG. 
---
By telling people to "google it" you're literally just shaming people for trying to have basic human interaction, not everybody wants to sit and study spreadsheets and graphs and read endless amounts of guides, they want the multiplayer aspect of it. So yes, to those people you're being a dick. you're basically telling them they should completely forgo the journey of figuring stuff out and they shouldn't bother playing the game unless they know everything about it already.
---
Or you could play a healer spec and spend 0g on consumables instead of 50
---
It's because many people come from Retail where they will rip you a new one if you dare to ask how to do a dungeon, and rip you another one when you make a mistake, or if you're going too slow.
---
You're on the receiving end and pointing the finger at Blizzard, you're not who I'm talking about.  You're fine imo. You're not preventing other players from playing their mains for weeks and weeks. 
---
Again, I'm taking about the guys joining mob and pretending they're in a morally defensible position. Yes, Blizzard is responsible for the chaos, but the players are still responsible for their actions.  Two wrongs don't make a right.
---
I'm not saying playing fair is effective.  Given the balance of the playing field, I personally just wouldn't bring myself to do that to other people for an value-stripped pvp rank that I didn't earn hanging over my head.
---
No one was carrying anyone to R1 for only 1k gold.  You probably meant selling weekly arena points for 2k+ rating which is very different.  WHen people say merciless glad that means R1, standard glad was 2200 MMR and somewhat attainable through carrying on a weak battlegroup, on a standard or strong battleground I'd seriously doubt anyone could do that carry, too many PvP nuances in 2v2.
---
I could hear the "EEEEEEEHHHH" of his death in my head. Beautiful.
---
Yeah, hoj is one I would never roll on. Luckily I got rune of the guard captain (not to mention dm trinket is out now), but any hunter taking hand of justice is a douche.

Imagine trying so hard to miss the point you spam the comments with your inane drivel. I guess I'll spell it out so you can understand. 60 hordes that stay on the boat to darkshore do so to catch grey levels in death loops and grief them. 
---
There, do you really not get that was what the op comment was about? Inb4 dense nonsense response pretending not to get the point.
---
Im level 37 Tauren saving for first mount. I am still Honored with TB. Should I grind rep to Exalted also get pvp rank 3 for discounted mount? If so how much work would that be vs just farming mobs?
---
You act like it's automatic that I'll get T1 chest from MC. It's been 3 months, and I think our guild has one? And we have 6 hunters.
---
I've been wearing SGC for 3 months, and that's plenty of mileage to justify taking it as a hunter. Probably be wearing it for another few months, too, at the rate we get hunter drops in MC.
---
And +30% damage from zerk, and 150 sp from flask, and 35 sp from potion... the multipliers really get nutty at that point.
---
The best way of saying "shut the fuck up" in the most non-verbal way

Keep your faps to yourself
---
wouldn't even sell for 10g and was almost a negative find from AH posts getting lower and lower and vendor price.
---
You realise that I'm an ally player right? 
---
And they're smaller, but not that much smaller. It's enough to shift the ratio by ~5%, when you account for a population that's less invested in PvP.
---
&gt;because a Hunter rolling on Savage Glad Chest because its mail and good gear is still bad because "The warrior would not replace it as soon as the Hunter would."
---
Would heartily laugh at any dumbass saying this to me and roll anyway. 
---
Hunters wear mail. I mean ffs.
---
I fucking hate that this has become a norm.
---
In IF there's always a rogue or mage reviving, blowing load on a low max health target, dying after getting a kill, repeat.
---
This is probably the scummest way to get honor and I hate that even if you want to combat this it's not worth it.
---
They almost **always** will get the honor out of it, getting a kill is easy if the target isn't ready to suddenly die. Killing them doesn't even do anything helpful either as thanks to diminishing returns on HKs they're worth 0 honor after like 2x while they're still getting 200 honor per kill.
---
Tanks are rare AF. Healers are way easier to find. 
---
The reason tanks do this, is because they have no other good goldfarming methods, using their skill sets and specs. 
---
That tank likely doesn't need anything from the instance, and is joining specifically to earn some money, whilst you get to not spam chat for an hour looking for a tank, and instead get the gear you need (plus exp, if you're below 60.) 
---
It's a win/win.
---
you messed up the joke.
---
Sapphiron will be extremely difficult on the healers without at least a few of them popping wisdom flasks.
---
And what would this non "toxic" way of gaining honor be in your eyes, if not roaming high level zones as a 5man?
---
Only do 1v1s after your opponent is full hp and mana? People on this sub are delusional
---
Keep in mind he said *warriors* not *warriors willing to tank*
---
OP probably thinks if your a warrior you should be forced to tank for him
---
Noobs flocks to the “best” classes. It’s not without a reason you have so many bad mages and warriors compared to vanilla where the class spread was larger.
---

Mana doesn't regen in fatigue in Classic.
---
A bug = not working as intended.
---
This was, it's just not very smart.
---
I soloed it as a lvl 40 something Warrior. I don't think you'd have much problems considering you can heal + bear.
---
If you're about the end of the video with low lvl montage, it's MSBT (Mik's scrolling battle)
---
You could try to farm for the PVP rank, but it's only 10g savings and the time required likely isnt worth it.  Exalted doesnt give you anything to decrease the cost.  I personally just did a shit ton of SM from like 36-40 and that got me almost enough gold to buy my mount at 40.
---
&gt; This griefing BS
---
You mean the killing of people 10+ times when they're trying to get to a BRD run, right?
---
Frankly I think that you're naive about group behavior. How many fish do you think would be in the lakes without catch limits? How clean would the water be without regulations that prohibit excessive runoff? Look to China and India for your answers. The reality is that large groups of people need cohesive systems in place to ensure decent behavior. In the context of this game, that would have been populations in line with what the world is designed for and faction balancing. Blizzard botched it so proficiently that I have to think they wanted their game to fail.
---
talk shit, get a shitty horde player who can't PvP spam die/revive in IF for 200 honor per 3 minutes for 5 hours because you can't kill anything else any other way.
---
Naw there was definitely plenty of PK in the first five or so years after LoD release. I played a ton of diablo and it definitely was a thing until at least 2005, it died out a bit after then it’s true though.
---
That's why you destroy your soulbound on, take the BoE, mail it to and alt and sell it there while restoring your soulbound one and putting it back on.
---
I pumped for this. Running around and looking for PvP is boring as hell.
---
It’s because if your life goes down, it’s probably ok. We expect it. But if it suddenly goes up, you probably popped a cd or something. Why? Are you in trouble? Are you deciding to stand in fire for a few seconds to get your cast off? Just in case, take a heal.
---
Yah, that's what I said.  Toxic corpse camping gank squads.
---
This is dumb don't use this guide
---
We are getting the 1.12 version of AV which will not have lotus spawns like pservers did.
---
Saw Prot pali do this to hunter and pets. Works great!  Total of 5 hunter in the raid.
---
Because in the age of information, ignorance is a choice.
---
Thinking with broad strokes.
---
I'm actually shocked. It's people getting offended on the behalf of people who wouldn't be offended by this
---
Biggest problem is that people who have no idea what they're doing rarely want advice, and will get mad if you tell them.
---
Tanking is quite stressful. Not hard. Just takes a lot of energy and focus. Easier to go dps as warrior. I think that is the reason.  Also ofc that some ppl absolutely don’t want to lead and a tank has to lead somewhat.
---
I leveled ele and am currently still ele at lvl 55. It’s a blast honestly, once you get elemental mastery you can 100% crit your next spell (sometimes 2 if you cast correctly) and absolutely delete alliance in PvP. Go for staves/ 1 hand and shield weapons that increase nature spell damage. You can also have +Int gear but I find spell power better. I crit my lvl6 lightning bolt for around 1100dmg with a mixture of +spell damage and int+spirit gear. Totems are nice but your main damage dealer will be lightingbolt
---
Looks like he's got the 1H mace off Nefarian in BWL with +84 spell damage, also.
---
pve servers make up the 33% of the population that's a lot less likely to play bgs, they won't be close to 33% of bg players.  they're also not 100% alliance, so they won't impact the overall ratio as much as you think.
---
there's def not a huge portion of professional wsg players that can 1-minute wsg enough to bring the average down to 3 lol.  without a timed win condition the average will be a lot higher.
---
it'd be tough, as you normally get a lot of adds in the deamdmines. Also trash tends to run away, which can pull others. 
---
Why'd you fancy running it at solo at 31?  Challenge / Gear?
---
Some people don’t want to play with greedy people and don’t mind waiting around for someone with a common goal.
---
I usually don’t start wow if I’m in any rush IRL. So I just wait for the right tank to show up.
---
Lies. Playing on a PVE server right now, there's nightly Hillsbrad battles and all day on weekends.
---
I wish I could be a fly on the wall to watch these people wipe repeatedly on the cthun room entry
---
It's all a matter of magnitude. Before DM was released HoJ was technically a BiS trinket for hunters, but you gotta be a real dick to roll for one over melee classes. SGC is kind of in the same boat to a much lesser magnitude. A big factor however is the fact that hunters can solo farm SGCs, so if you really want one you're basically guaranteed one if you put in the effort.
---
The point is that SGC lasts much longer on warriors and is harder for them to obtain, so if a hunter wins one over a warrior in a group it's gonna leave a bad taste in someone's mouth.
---
Sincerely, a hunter who uses Ogre Mail because I know it's not that big of a deal and I will get T1 chest soon.
---
You need 2 tanks per 40 man in a raid (5%), but need 1 per 5 man in a dungeon (20%). This results in a huge lack of tanks for dungeons at 60 and tanks speccing dps or heal for raids.
---
Because of this ratio, the tanks that are out there have all the gear they need (since they had instant groups for dungeons, raidloot), so the only motivation for them to tank your dungeon would be vendorloot/gold.
---
They absolutely were. 
---
They weren't at the **end of vanilla**, which is what we're playing, just without access to the later raids.
---
This is straight up false. Battle Shout's threat is split among all targets while Demoralizing Shout is a static threat gain. There are very few circumstances where Battle Shout is the correct choice.
---
What a legend.
---
I feel violated.
---
Why though?
---
" OHHH YEAAAAH!!!"
---
Let's speak again in 6 months
---
I understand that but saying “100% if you afk he will die” is incorrect.
---
I think only the Crimson Elite patrol can kill him; but they can't do it everytime
---
Yeah sorry the clip starts just as i'm tagging the turtle that the hunter-bot is about to farm. He kills it for me while I work on my own turtle. 
---
I asked if he wanted to group for the quest to kill 15 and it was clear to me that he was a bot. So for the next 15 or so kills I just followed him around and tagged his target right before he would auto-bot it.
---
"yOu'Re cOmpArinG tHe HorDe to NAziS"
---
I'm not sure why dispelling disguise doesn't count as griefing. Afaik it was bannable on some p.servers, because there is no way to counter it and you lose like 15+ minutes every time.
---
You don't "farm" a world drop but ok.
---
I would kill for luck like that, literally 50% of our gear last week was hunter drops and we only had one hunter and he was a PuG (GM of another guild's alt).
---
This
---
Can you elaborate? It's from Traque, an EU Private server hunter.
---
I got up at 6AM on a Saturday morning specifically to complete this quest. Yay.

No. The opposite is true now. What you're stating was the case when Classic was first released, but this was patched in September. The link in the OP specifically addresses what you're saying.
---
&gt; a Hunter rolling on Savage Glad Chest because its mail and good gear is  still bad because "The warrior would not replace it as soon as the  Hunter would." 
---
I can see the frustration with this being how difficult it is to obtain. That said, anyone doing that grind should probably have a conversation about it with the party before this situation occurs.
---
As far as the community goes, from what I've seen, the majority is welcoming and helpful. When I mess up or don't do something right, I rarely get flamed for it. I personally have been playing on and off since Vanilla and I love helping newer players learn the game. I often even play dumb when running lower instances to try and make other players comfortable with their mistakes. Then it feels like we learn things together.
---
That said, I have had poor encounters before. I can think of two big reasons on why these interactions can go so poorly. One is that with any large group of people, there are going to be assholes. There are thousands of people playing Classic and we are constantly interacting with each other. Eventually we are all going to bump assholes. Second, I feel, is how gaming has changed since Vanilla was in its prime. You can kind of use Retail as an example of how games can be much more streamlined with a higher frequency of actions and rewards. It seems like some players struggle to appreciate the pace and flow of Classic. I know that mentality has cause many of the wipes I've encountered, and sometimes the responsible parties will attempt to shift blame.
---
Uh, yeah actually. It doesn't matter how many Alliance dominated servers there are. All that matters is that a server has a heavy imbalance. The larger faction will shit on the smaller one 1000% of the time. That's how it works. It's not just all horde my man.
---
Right but you were the one who said if you afk he will 100% die which is flat out incorrect.
---
No it isnt.
---
Unyielding has 1 more Stam vs losing 2 Def and 10 Armor, Warden is better.
---
It's easy.
---
Imagine 5k concurrent online on PVP server. Most posts bashing p2 complain about significant faction imbalance, right? Some claim 80/20, some agree to 70/30, let's say 70/30, so 3500 dominant vs 1500 overwhelmed.
---
What are most complaints about? "Whereever I go, I am killed with 4-5 to 1 advantage, rolling deathsquads everywhere, I am unable to quest and play this game, to reach BRM portal takes 10 corpseruns" etc. etc.
---
Now the key point is the advantage and players ratio. Complainers are unhappy, because there are too many enemies killing them. Guess what, these enemies do it because they like what they are doing. They either like PVP for the sake of it or they like getting high PVP rank and the only way to do it is to gank people. So they gank. Their actions affirm their content with current situation since they have all freedom of choice. 
---
Now that's very important to understand there is no need to prove "overwhelming majority likes it". It's important to understand "overwhelmed minority hates it". Because they hate it for the very same reason: because they are overwhelmed and because they are minority.
---
&gt;Booooohoooooo waaaaaaah
---
FTFY
---
A single DK at ranks 4-5 ish isn't even close to a whole week of PvP lost in one fight btw
---
You'd describe yourself as "progressive," wouldn't you?
---
Nsfw for this? Eh
---
Tanks are rare because warriors neither want to tank nor want to run any of the dungeons outside say UBRS.
---
Having said that, Druid tanks are friggin awesome for dungeons, with there were more.
---
Found the guy who has definitely never played on a PvE server.
---
TM vs SS wars are nearly constant, there's pretty regular capital city raids, and in endgame zones a decent amount of people walk around flagged for the fightin' if it should happen. Loads of PvP happens on PvE servers.
---
Skarm does seem to have some haters, I trolled one a few weeks ago just to see if there was a serious reason for the hate. Didn't really get to the motivation behind it.
---
Big company spends big chunk of money for an investment that has a potential to make them a ton of money, but...they do it so it doesn't work..
---
Sounds..not realistic? I've seen this narrative a bit here and there but I just don't buy it. Blizz saw the largest sub increase in a quarter due to classic right? Why would they want to lose that profit?
---
Blizzard definitely should have done something to balance it out, sure I wish they did. I think the joke aspect of horde farming in raids because they know no one will stop them then having people leave the server in droves is funny in it's own nature because they're the cause of it. Not Blizzard.
---
&gt;Looks like he's got the 1H mace off Nefarian in BWL with +84 spell damage, also.
---
That must be it. Looks a lot like the HWL mace, but forgot the alliance one looks different.
---
Listen here horde im level 51 they are dekt out geard level 60s 7 of them and this is my frist character as casual player , what do you want me to say yeah  i ganked one of them when i was level 40? lol
---
you'll definitely save more time just farming for gold than farming honor
---
also exalted doesn't give you anything to TB as a Tauren so don't bother
---
If you afk 100% it's a matter of chance. If he meets the pack while still within Hearthglen he'll die. If he doesn't counter them until he's out of the town he will easily kill them instead
---
I'm talking from more of an ingame party stand point. if you can't be assed to take 2 minutes to google something but you can make whatever it is you may be doing take 2 or more times as long for everyone else. you're doing it at the expense of their time.

---
I used this guide, and I top dps almost every dungeon I'm in. The only difference is I have think delar
---
i have boosted a few players there. nothing wrong with it, they get free xp and afk, meanwhile it helps my faction.
---
I mean, they are interested in being among the first (if not THE first) wave of players to hit Rank 14. That involves a mixture of large-scale PVP, gank squads (which in itself involves the decision to corpse-camp or kill and move on), and solo play (depending on class and availability of your friends). When BGs hit, all of these players will move to BGs since the honor per hour is better. Aside from this behaviour messing with your cringy reddit-tier moral compass, what is the problem with playing this way in order to ensure you are one of the first Rank 14s? You gonna stand on the side of the road and /salute every member of the opposing faction and hope you hit standing 1 every week?
---
i thought for some reason you got a discounted mount for exalted?
---
Had that thing drop for me. I still have it on my bank alt because I'm reluctant to vendor it, but even more reluctant to put it up on the AH again and just lose more deposit money.
---
I unirconically love when reddit gets SUPER pedantic
---
Yea sounds about right.
---
A failed IF raid on Grobb had a level 1 outside the gates feeding horde info on where we are and they used it to try to get into IF. When a lot of ally were at the gates to defend the horde would back off a split into smaller groups. If we chased then the other groups would come together and make a push up the ramp only if there wasn't a group to defend at the gates. We started talking to the spy and he wasn't keeping it a secret or anything. Such a bitch move. They couldn't even make to the gates either.
---
They also said to their investors in the quarterly report that they're planning to release Classic expansions in "off years" to maintain subs while retail doesn't have a new expansion. 
---
So 2020: Shadowlands 
---
2021: TBC   
---
2022: Retail Expansion  
---
2023: WOTLK   
---
2024: Retail expansion 
---
2025: ???
---
If you are having to pay(reserving drops is payment) for tanks or healers to get groups ran, your guild is either to small or to self centered. There are so many small 6-10 active member guilds out there that would be better off merging with other guilds to have healthy community sizes. 
---
I’m not saying everyone should be in 3+ raid team mega guilds. But these micro guilds don’t work well with Classic. Granted that’s easier said than done. Merging can be messy and finding a bigger guild you mesh with can be tough but it’s worth it in the long run.
---
This is a good question, I've noticed that some wall jumps from Vanilla are almost impossible now while jumps for things like Dire Maul and Blackrock Spire are the same as they used to be. I do know that at some point they added teleporting walls to WSG so if I got out early it would port me back to the room.

If you're mostly OT or doing 5mans don't go fury prot.  It's really horrible for 5mans.  Anyway as a tauren you should be using Perdition's Blade/Corehound Tooth with Aged Core Leather Gloves.  305 skill is king.
---
I tend to disagree, even in Strat in the pulls where you have 2 elite ghouls and 4 non elites leading up to cath in Live side, I prefer tab targeting sunders and using  revenge with a mouseover macro.
---
I am always looking to improve my game, so I will try it out and see, but I suspect its not going to beat conventional tanking.
---
Yup, they couldn't even recreate their old game without fucking it up substantially on several levels. How the fuck are they going to create new content on that level?
---
Beast stalkers set bonus is nowhere near as good as the other gear you could get
---
&gt;Releasing honor without bg's was insane
---
That is how Vanilla was
---
No, shut up you have no idea what youre talking about.
---
Its not that simple, it depends on how many targets you have, how geared you are, and how many allies are in range of your bshout.
---
Bshout generates threat based on how many targets it hits, and then divides that threat equally among all the mobs youre engaged in combat with. Depending on the numbers, demo shout or ww are better.
---
So many arms warriors doing shit damage
---
I like DF because its essentially a free full heal every 2 minutes, granted you have the initial mana to cast it. I also just don't know where else I'd put the points if I stopped after 14 Holy. I guess you could go 14/26/11? That seems like the most aggressive build that still gains maximum healing output.
---
It is absolutely worth it to switch stances to use abilities. Learning to stance dance (switch back and forth) is a key part of being a warrior. You can make your life easier with macros but ultimately it's all preference. I personally keep a macro for overpower, pummel, whirlwind, and taunt. The macros let me instantly switch to the appropriate stance and cast the ability then I can swap back to whatever stance I need. You typically cant switch back to the previous stance with the one button macro because of global cooldowns.
---
As for tracking procs you can use weak auras to show the icon above the enemy which is what I use to track overpower so I dont have to be reading logs for dodges.
---
Some people don't wanna play with noobs either but a righteous orb would make me consider it.

Ive been playing vanilla for years and pvp servers are very much different than what it was on Pservers. Very rarely did i meet gank squad. Pvp happened naturally in the world like at the farming spots or stv etc but the meta is raid ganking people. If i knew it wouldve been like this i wouldve rolled on pve instead
---
Idk about other servers, but the neutral AH is dead on Sulfuras, and it’s a pretty active server.

---
Oh look it’s. Horde player here to be toxic and camp /golfclap
---
I will try tab targeting more post-initial-pull. I can accept that, after initial threat is established, I may be wrong about BS being the optimal way to maintain threat.
---
I think you could do that as tank Van C in Bear, but get some stam food, some health pots just to be safe.  Defo worth a go.  
---
At 37-38, I could stealth through and Kill the SM GY boss solo.
---
I dont expect everybody to have anticipated what would happen on PvP servers but I was warning people in Classic WoW discords about what phase 2 would be like as long ago as the day they first announced the phases and people were literally laughing at me saying PvP is the only way to play vanilla that PvE servers are for pussies and that world PvP being so prominent to the point that the game is unplayable sounded great to them. Some of those exact people have now quit the game entirely or rerolled on PvE servers. But hey, who knew?
---
Yes i played it and wars were constant ,no place was safe.Its stupid how people think vanilla was stone age of gaming and ppl didn't know their shit..Servers were full,Karagath often had 5-10 raids ready to go and fight in BRM
---
i could use some more coffee. do they have coffee?
---
&gt;Should I hop guilds?
---
Can't tell you this, but I can say there are plenty or other raiding guilds with fewer warlocks.
---
I think this is where it gets hairy.  A very aware player might pass if someone needs a piece of kit that will last them a lot longer.  Maybe not totally expected, but a definite bro move.  Especially when next phase is imminent (like in a couple of weeks).  For the rarest drops I think it's definitely the right thing to do, like for SGC. 
---
I know it's not the same as pug dungeoning, but our guild uses loot council specifically to try to give players gear that will last their class/spec the longest.  No need to deny someone P2 gear that is bis to P5 so someone else who would replace it in P3 can have it.
---
Flagging for pvp is optional is the major cities. If he just waited to unflag then there wouldn't be any issues.
---
People did this stuff is Vanilla too, its nothing new.
---
Horde streamers definitely complained about not having enough alliance queueing BGs, so effectively...yeah, kinda
---
Really? Is there really a lot to do besides MC and onyxia once a week?
---
I think youre experiencing a clash and difference in your expected community culture. Try a different game. Wow is full of unoriginal toxic tryhard shitters with low IQ. There are many nice folks but they are hard to find and honestly the shitheads will drive you crazy.
---
&gt; I'm not sure why dispelling disguise doesn't count as griefing.
---
PvPing on a PvP server is griefing.
---
Preventing the opposing faction, the enemy, from completing a quest is griefing.
---
Raiding is greifing, leveling is griefing, afking is griefing, casting spells is griefing. You Classic babies are actually so fragile, I guess it makes sense, given all the shit the Classic babies were slinging up until launch.
---
For every [question] there is an answer that is clear, simple and wrong.
---
Which is what he was referring to / meant by when he said "hate speech". Spectacular discovery.
---
Comparing to other servers sulfuras is fairly balanced! It’s still about a 60/40 horde favoured though, probably the best alliance can hope for lol.
---
For casters, out of all the stuff you listed, Night Dragon's Breath is basically the most useful in PvP. You never want to use a rune in PvP, you're not going to have healthstones on hand at all times, and often times you're more interested in gaining mana than health (and even if you aren't, the lily root is not a major downgrade from Whipper Root Tuber).
---
^ makes fc almost impossible to cc in flag room

Do it! But make sure they're \*real achievements\*. Things you actually have to go out of your way for.
---
From the site: "The data is limited to only characters level 10 and up that have been seen in the previous 30 days."
---
If you logged on once in the whole month and were seen by the addon, you were counted as active. Not to mention alts, etc. While the data itself is good, I don't think it can be applied correctly here.
---
if tanks are easy to find,. then dont group with tanks that demand that.. simple
---
Short answer
---
You need a tank
---
He is a tank
---
He has a price 🤣
---
Sucks but if you burn over an 1hr looking for a tank and cant find one, its worth it to some.
---
~3%. Getting to 305 or higher lowers the hit cap to the 6% you're referencing, otherwise its 9% (for non-dual wielding attacks and all yellow hits)
---
druids number one at solo for survavibility. mages pretty nice aoe damage but really squischy. warlocks number too because they kinda have alot of survavibility. priests best for 1v1. warriors op with premades that know what they do
---
Weapons an gear gets replaced fast, mount dont

Hi,

How can I use this tool to import my in-game character?

I downloaded the Wowhead Client, even run the game for a minute, uploaded charcater data, still nothing. I keep getting the same error msg like "Use wowhead client"
---
I think you're taking this a little too seriously, my dude.
---
Happened to me while returning that quest. I just did /sleep and from laying down I moved out but it took forever
---
You're right there ARE warriors everywhere, and only 1% of then actually tank.
---
A geared priest could solo sfk easily. Run some buddy's alts through and test your luck. I've farmed 3 shadowfangs and one assa blade in 90 somthing runs
---
Implying modern blizz won't horribly fuck that up

Just disable TullaRange. Bartender supports that by default.

---
Depends on the topic.
---
&gt; he just said that if he asks other players they might tell a lie just to get his gear
---
What?  No he didn't.  Your reading comprehension could use some work.
---
It's about incentive.
---
It is common accepted practice to give your first Righteous Orb to the tank for a live Stratholme run. Some groups even offer all orb drops to the tank. In any case, the run takes about an hour and the orb sells for around 25-35g on most servers. If the tank just did DM East jump runs, they could make that much gold, if not more. An enchanter can make more than 40g in an hour just AFKing in town.
---
A full BRD run takes something like two hours, and it's usually a slog. While it definitely appears greedy to ask for all greed green/blue drops, your tank is likely still taking a loss to tank BRD for you.
---
It's honestly hilarious. Alliance on classicwow are really trying to push this narrative that Horde never get ganked and Alliance can't leave IF. Like why do you think I'm leveling a hunter alt for DMT? Open world is off limits for us too, I get ganked 10 times trying to get to DM. Yet everyone complaining are always alliance.
---
I use NeatPlates + SUF (Shadowed Unit Frames) and I love it. NeatPlates has some good templates out of the box (Quattre is nice imo) and SUF was tedious to setup (wasn't great out of the box) but once setup looks awesome and super customizable.

Make your way to the Shatterspear Vale, even though it's better for mages to farm you can just kill the one-off trolls mindlessly and endlessly. Alliance only spot. Good luck.
---
Not in a post, in a comment.
---
always epic mount first.
---
"hate speech ***against horde***" being horde isn't a disability so I fail to see how ableism would be hate speech against horde instead of you know, disabled people.
---
Yeah I feel you. I've been done with dungeons, done helping friends/guildies get prebis, I can 2 man dm e for money... You couldn't promise me all the orbs in a live run to tank for ransoms haha. It's very rarely a smooth run. People want to pull for you and shit, split dps, etc etc, no thanks I'll pass.
---
Lionheart lasts all of classic.
---
Besides Gold farming, but even then, you can't go anywhere without roving packs of 40 Hordes looking to stop you from picking flowers.
---
He was saying motherzuckerberger which is offensive to Mark Zuckerberg and therefore offensive to everyone.
---
Is it though? If life's taught me anything, it's that when all the "experts" agree, the exact opposite will most likely happen.

I spent a few good hours and still not satisfied. But rolling with this for now

---
It does however come with a complexity cost. You can change so much that it took me a while to find all useful settings.
---
must be an act
---
I switched from horde to alliance, and have had the same experience as you. Yet every time i mention it, i'm getting downvoted into oblivion. No point arguing, people will believe what what they want to believe, but to me it's a fact that due to the stronger pvp racials, significantly more people who are good at pvp or even want to pvp went horde.
---
Waited where? I see you've never actually been in IF since the PvP system hit. Teleporting to IF from any contested zone is almost a death sentence on its own.
---
Yeah 5man tanking isn't hard it is just you have to constantly be paying attention.  You have to know the next pack to pull, you have to verify there are no pats, you have to ensure no one is OOM/LOM, you have to constantly be tab cycling instead of fixate on one mob, if aggro gets pulled you are expected to snap to that target and taunt, you are expected to know and manage boss mechanics, you are expected to know the appropriate pulls and dungeon path.  Probably more I'm not even thinking about.  It is far less stressful to just DPS.
---
That is an interesting question.. how does that work?  Or does that mount cost 800?
---
Please provide the results of these tests. I will be glad to admit I am wrong if new information shows that to be the case and take this thread down.
---
Oh because the Alliance never come into Orgrimmar, right? Gtfo here lmao.
---
I've encountered this attitude countless times on reddit, but not once in game.
---
Yep, these Reddit cry threads get me through my work days.  It's an endless salt mine.
---
use AUX, it always shows "market value" and current auctions and even tells you how much % current auctions differ from market value.
---
All of your comments clearly prove this point.
---
epic mount, axes if nothing drops from raids, then lionheart.
---
SK is efficient AFIA Concerned. Somebody near the top gets a drop, they go to the bottom of the list, and so on and so on. If Whiskey joined late to the raid, he's going to be on the bottom. The people who have been farming MC for weeks now might be simply holding out for their Mageblade or Staff of Dominance, leading most of the tier pieces on much lower priority for them. A person near the bottom has nothing to lose by constantly going for gear.
---
Dont forget we get blamed for anything that goes wrong as well!
---
Stonespine right? that rogue is a permanent resident of Ironforge
---
Jeezz. And even 60/40 is considerable. Horde has 50% more people!
---
As someone who spent the entirety of vanilla WoW frustrated by paladins "opting out" of fights I was about to win, this is extremely satisfying.
---
This is why I chose east coast server even tho i am West coast. Around midnight its 3 am over in the east coast and I did this quest in 1 try. super lucky

Well, its a chance for a good product, vs a 100% disaster as far I see it.
---
I've played TBC recently, and I know I don't want to gown that path.

I have no idea, i didn't even know you could do that. I just selected each item individually.

To help you out a bit, correct AoE rotation is Battle Shout -&gt; Demo Shout -&gt; Tab Sunder if you are pulling into your group, or skip Battle Shout if you are charging into the mobs (Battle Shout won't hit all party members).

Not really, if there is pvp in a zone it's 5vs1 and after a while it turns to the other factions favor for  5vs1 yet again. I love the pvp when it's 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3 etc. but so far I haven't encountered it yet.

You seem angry, would you mind telling me an honorable and respectable and acceptable and non "toxic" way of gaining honor? Thanks.

wow this, above all else, shows that we really do live in a society

in the first months there were thousands. its was great helping these people, and then assholes drove a lot of them away
---
got reposted as it was removed by a mod for hate speech
---
In the time there wasting they could have been in and 1/2 done. 
---
Its not greed, your offering a service at a reasonable price. 
---
Like you said, you can sit and wait as an option. Most folks dont have an 1hr to burn waiting for a tank and are willing to pay the price.
---
You don't. Even if it were, it is absolutely not worth the time investment
---
I don’t play a Druid, but I’m still stoked to see some gameplay from top druids in WSG. A Druid evading an entire team trying to kill them and get out safely is a thing of beauty. Keep in mind that WSG is a hyper team focused BG when played at a high level so it’s not all about the Druid, but they are the lynchpin  the team.
---
:O 
---
Well thanks.
---
This isn't much different.  They end up actively tried to stop other horde guilds from getting azuregos
---
I find I'm expected to lead, and at this point I've accepted it and learned enough to do so. But your right, it can be stressful, especially when you're with pugs that fight the target they feel like fighting, not the current focus.
---
That’s what I’ve been preaching to my ready to quit friends! Just wait a week and all you’ll hear is waaaahhh alliance favoured bgs waaaahhhhh paladins waaahhhhhh premades wahhhhh long ques. Horde had their p2, now alliance get their p2.5.
---
Fury prot is great not just while leveling. I’m one of the main tanks in my guild and it works great for Mc and ony. And when not  tanking I can still dps pretty well.
---
&gt; Same goes for BiS gear.
---
I don't even know what BiS gear is. I'm just a simple Priest on a simple PvE server, doing quests, talking shit with my guild, and slowly saving up for a mount which I will then perch on in Org and admire my accomplishment. I haven't even ran 90% of the dungeons in the game, don't know shit about them.
---
I have a feeling a lot more players are like me than many think.
---
It's so boring though that you realistically won't find a lot of hunters or warriors willing to sacrifice being able to play properly in order to maximize raid dps. A enhancement shaman however will be happy wield one in order to get a raid spot.
---
Yes SGC
---
What discord is that? Is there a link?
---
Ok bunky.
---
People complaining about mega servers have never been on a dead server.  Dead servers are fcking HORRIBLE.  You cant find groups.  It takes hours to form anything.  There are only so many guild you can join.  The economy sucks, you stuff never sells etc.    
---
I will take a mega server hands down over a dead server.  Its not even a debate.  
---
And be patient.  More and more people will quit.  Mega servers will become high pop servers.  But trust me, mega servers are a good thing.
---
gotcha  So do you run the regular Slam spec for it?
---
The caveat to that statement is assuming the healer is not in melee range of the mobs.  The threshold to pull a mob off the tank is higher for ranged (130%) than it is for melee (110%)
---
Both are good for BiS. Personally I just like the Crossbow better because of the added stats and higher attack speed. Also depends on your race as well. If you are the races with the added gun skill then go for the dwarven cannon.
---
What discord is that do you have a link?
---
Don't use WoWhead. I would find your class Discord as they will usually have resources pinned. Icy Veins is also pretty decent but I have also found a few minor differences from other lists.
---
Okay cool, I'll remember that for when I hit level 60.
---
Thanks for your input :)
---
You’re fighting Murlocs, and one is running away with low HP. You finish him with a ranged ability before he pulls another pack. You can’t loot his corpse now without pissing off his friends. AOE looting would let you loot some other Murloc you recently killed to range loot him. Not a huge impact, but it is a change nonetheless.
---
I like this https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0 .
---
The only mistake is that I believe the +55 healing helmet is better and the Choker of the Firelord is better than the Strat neck (very slightly, which is why I presume its actually not on the list).
---
haahhahaahha
---
you can't dodge overpower lol, that's the whole point
---
Lol this guy is clearly trolling just look at the fucking pet comment. That was where it was supposed to be obvious.
---
It's also not a particularly useful ore.
---
And the classical alliance response is to rage quit and not even play the game. Everyone gets camped at the end of the day. Horde will hate alliance and alliance will hate the horde, the game is engineered that way. While I agree world PvP is dog shit, it’s changing really soon. At least it isn’t a phase 3 release.
---
Am that Shaman. Yea, some of y'all deserve it for making me do this quest 10+ times due to gank &lt;3
---
Fuck, it's like were on all on different servers or someshit. Amazing.
---
I said my schedule is the same as his. Go to raids, get ganked a lot along the way, do raid, log off.
---
It would be pretty much the same schedule without alliance gank squads because there isn't a lot for me to do right now.
---
"Get out" is probably not a desirable outcome, though.
---
They're nearly the same, IMO. I like the crossbow personally, as it creates a smoother rotation. 
---
Something that might influence your decision is what race you are. The +5 gun skill could allow you to drop some hit for different gear/talents, for example.
---
So the guides I have been following suggest downranking FH and Renew.  I’m wondering if it would be helpful to bump up my renew another rank.
---
What spell ranks did you use?  Just the ones in the TipsOut guide on Wowhead?
---
Census statistics data.
---
As a holy pally ill just tell a warrior or pally to slap on a shield for the bosses, able to heal through dungeons without issue. If they refuse i know a boomkin looking for a group that has no problem going bear form.
---
Lol at the thought of streamers being important or powerful.
---
So much this!  I have a list of 15-20 dps and 8-12 healers that are on most nights I dont raid. 
---
If folks in guild are busy I hit up the message banner in Flist and fill from there vs rando pug.
---
I'm not a WoW player, I found this thread through the Newsweek article--
---
&gt;Honor is given to members of the opposite faction who slay an enemy that's 10 levels higher or ***lower*** than themselves.
---
Are you telling me that you get honor points for being grossly overleveled and killing an enemy player? How is this a good system? Where's the competitiveness of PVP when one player has such a tremendous advantage over the other? And the overleveled player is REWARDED for that? Am I understanding this correctly? How does anyone believe this is a good system? Where is the fun in being ganked with no hope of defending yourself? If I am misunderstanding how this works, someone explain it to me please.
---
Gets crushed by any hunter+ healer 2v2 of equal skill
---
Oh yes great moderator, we will get right on answering those questions from other people. 
---
Please let us know if the discussion generated is up to your satisfaction
---
Have you even attempted to get your own group together instead of crying on reddit?
---
You only need honored for that.  Exalted takes way way longer and doesn't offer any additional discount for mounts.
---
Honored takes 6k from Friendly.  As Tauren, you start friendly with all allied factions (Tauren/Orc/Undead)
---
I do more as a rogue, have seen warriors doing around 800 dps there tho
---
What if you can't get away from the flight master
---
the other facts is something that a player might not know .... but if someone doesnt know strength is not a stat for them then lol.
---
dude post this to your own server subreddit. you know all server AHs are seperate right?
---
The duality of man.
---
might wanna change your name to butthurt
---
No layering would not be a problem if the factions were balanced.
---
It’s obviously not top tier. Was just a fun break from the same warlock druid drinkfests.
---
I want you to know that these complaints are a main reason why they introduced one of the worst additions  ever to the live version of the game. Sharding. 
---
Because of complaints about over population, now you don’t see anyone at all when you go outside the major cities. Maybe one person every now and then. If you want to see what a fix would look like, go on retail and see the impact of sharding and how it ruined the community aspect of the game when you never run into the same player despite playing on the same server actively for years. 
---
That’s what a permanent layer does.
---
There isn't any overpopulation: the server cap is filled only on a very small amount of servers and it's not that much higher than vanilla cap.
---
Gathering professions make a lot of money.  Skinning and either mining or herb is the best for that.  You don't want to do mining and herb together because you can't track them both at the same time.  
---
Engineering is cool for all the classes.  Not sure if you can throw grenades or use trinkets in your forms though, so it might be a little more tricky for you.
---
Alchemy is the other easy to recommend trade, as it can make quite a bit of money from selling raid consumables, and you can keep yourself stocked up as well.
---
Enchanting has one of your best in slot bear tank trinkets in Heart of the Mountain.  Once you make that though, you can drop enchanting for something else.
---
That's a luxury many Alliance players don't have. Getting bored because you "did everything" is different from being bored because the only thing you can do is get camped while trying to do anything. 
---
There are plenty of Alliance players that'd love to hit 60, or farm pre bis/mats. Many are not logging in because they can't. 
---
What is context.
---
p2 means dungeon farming which means dme jump runs
---
You mention ww behind horrible for treats with a 1h, but what if you simply charge in with 2h ww then switch right back to 1h with a macro and keep going in your rotation?
---
ssshhh stop making sense!
---
you'll get downvoted
---
I can say the same for horde..
---
Because repair Bill's, more effort and bad dps.
---
Thank you. I'll keep this in my back pocket in the event I'm unsuccessful or otherwise decide it's not worth the effort traveling all the way over there just to fail.
---
Shaman is cool. But maybe not for a first timer.
---
Skinning + Herb IMO. Druids can stay in cat or travel form to collect both. Small time saver to not have to swap forms to mine a node.
---
Layering is to blame for alliance being total pussies in PvP.
---
If it wasn't for layering they would have learned to become bloodthirsty while lvling.
---
Just imagine that people played through all of STV with barely engaging in any PvP at all, its a disgrace.
---
HAHA.  However, WPVP isnt as fun as I remembered.  Looking forward to BGs.
---
&gt; Also alot of people say that Classic is more casual friendly than Retail.
---
abject liars
---
Even if it’s 50/50, population matters. As an extreme example , if you have 15k in one realm, PVP will be unavoidable, and that’s not how the game was intended. Also, population is much more controllable than faction balance.
---
Oh yea I know pallys are great fun, was my main forever back in the day.
---
I guess the only reason why myself and others are saying tbc will be coming is because it makes more sense for blizzard to release a tbc classic realm rather than make a classic+ project to continue well after naxx because it would cost them way less from a development perspective. It costs a lot more money for them to create new content, new quests, new raids, new everything to continue after classic+ than it would be to just create a TBC realm. Plus, the demand is definitely there for a TBC realm.
---
:(!!!! YOU GOT ME!!
---
Is fear considered a shadow spell? Would having shadow res aura + the talent make you resist like 1/5 or 1/4 of fears? Be worth testing, I have 2 points in it now.
---
Tanking is more stressful when your single target class with only 1 real taunt vs all the other classes that can spread the dmg out.
---
Fact is warriors dotn have alot of burst compared to hunters mages etc.
---
hahaha wttttttf
---
This is a great dialogue, you've both got great points. I'd like to add another - if you're a respected discord community or guildie or server mate, people may look up to you. It would be natural for them ask you questions if this if the case, but makes it twice as depressing if they get nothing out of you. They may even think that you have some cool answer or twist beyond the scope of simple guides. I have often found more nuance and information from asking other prominent shamans 'solved' questions before, in both retail in classic. Just some more food for thought!
---
how dare you take away their reasons to complain
---
Y'all just gotta pull yourselves up by the bootstraps
---
Seems like this is a cross server problem, dude.
---
What pservers did you play on that didn’t have people ganking in groups on honor release? The meta is mostly groups of 4-5 and sometimes up to 10 but it looks worse because there are many groups of horde looking for any alliance because the faction balance is so skewed.
---
Jimmy actually did it
---
&gt; for ~~some~~ shitty boomer casual gamer dads, the game is *unplayable* on the smaller faction 
---
ftfy
---
I wish Blizzard would stop wording things like that.
---
^ This is the only respectful comment in this entire post.
---
Does this mean you're constipated and then it all comes out at once?
---
bigot
---
Yea this is what I was thinking as well. IF tbc does come it won't be until well WELL after naxx. I don't think they would do the same rollout plan as they did with original vanilla. Most guilds weren't even running naxx because it didn't make sense to since TBC, and thus way better gear, was right around the corner.
---
QQ  
---
I play alliance but you act like server pop makes a difference, this happened in vanilla too.   
---
There just wasn't communication devices such as Discord to coordinate things.     
---
The fact is alliance are a bunch of pussies who run from fights and never want to group up to pvp.
---
Put 5 talent points in wand for a 25% boost to that damage.
---
Put 2 talent points into Searing Light for 10% smite damage
---
Put 5 talent points into Spirit tap for extra mana Regen
---
Give up being able to buff Spirit since you can't put that many into disc now
---
Profit.
---
Because Battle Shouting twice gives you strong AoE threat for less rage without having to leave DStance or remove your shield.
---
As someone trying to level on Noggenfogger, this sounds interesting. I've been thinking about transferring for a while and those ratios sound much better.
---
Interesting! This implies that if you're in a real 'every point of mana counts' situation, throwing lower rank renews around on the raid can really matter. But the Hps will be low, so only if it heals fast enough, of course.
---
It's not. Like everyone else, they expected a 90% dropoff in players very soon after launch. Layers were effectively server groups with everything but the world itself being cross-server inside the group. Reducing and removing layers allowed servers to stay at a healthy population as people dropped off, instead of having hundreds of servers with only a sliver of population. Since these layered groups already shared name reservations and allowed you to build communities with the people who did play, layer removal was a smoother and fluid server merge.
---
That was the intention, anyway. In the end too many people stuck around and a lot of servers are way too full.
---
Aside: The hardware cost explanation is bogus if you think about it. We are far past the age of having servers actually be distinct hardware. Servers are virtualised units on hardware that has way more capacity than a server is allotted. Making more distinct servers with less capacity happen instead of making those servers layers of the same meta-server is only a matter of configuring the hardware differently.
---
If you're like a lot of people right now, which is on a PvP server during Phase 2 but before BGs come out, then epic mount is super critical, because without it anyone who has one will be able to chase you down and there's nothing you'll be able to do to get away.
---
But apart from wPvP, it's more of a QoL upgrade.
---
Yeah, because alliance and horde are completely different kinds of people that behave different ways. /s. People develop habits based on their surroundings, if they’re underrepresented, they’ll avoid fights at higher cost. That’s about faction balance though, not population.
---
I can drink to that cheers mate
---
I wonder if you are able to point any server with 15k concurrent online right now.
---
Seems legit
---
Westfall has a full server status with no que times, world is always alive!
---
The nice thing about battle shout threat is that it works on ranged mobs you can’t pull to the group for whatever reason.   They will shoot the tank instead of the healer just from the tank using battle shout.
---
Ugh. Regrowth has a place, sure, but for druids, it's not terribly efficient. Downranked healing touch should be on every druid's hotbar. Yes, even the ferals. We have to heal at some point, and mana efficiency also matters for us.
---
Right, but I feel like there is some value in hardship and perseverance. We don't want to leave since we've put in so much work so we must rise to the challenge. As fruatrating as it sounds, it seems like the OP just isn't using the correct tools: the community.
---
&gt; Basic interaction feels good, it's cheap, it's easy, and we are all playing a MMORPG, where I'd in fact like to remember that the other characters I see are real people.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Passing interactions are great. Large discussions take a lot of effort. 
---
So you only want to interact with other people if it's cheap, fleeting, and meangingless? That doesn't sound to me like people who actually want to interact with others, but people who want fool themselves into thinking they are.
---
Guilds will always want to do MC for the chance at the Bindings to make more Thunderfury swords, and Eye of Ragnaros to make Hand of Ragnaros maces.  You might be in a run with a bunch of alts, but it shouldn't be too difficult to find a spot in a raid.  This is highly server dependent, though.

If you're a dwarf, go the gun.

---
That has 5x the Vanilla caps? No, probably not. But what if things don’t have to be 5 times larger to be too much.
---
do ppl believe the stupid shit that they say?
---
Fair enough. Though when BGs come out it should get a lot better for Horde. Alliance rankers will get instant queues while Horde rankers will still be out there ganking while waiting for their queues to pop.
---
Yeah, I reccomend everyone to try to play/research TBC before fucking us all by  encouraging Blizz to launch that expansion.
---
Insert a “you get what you fucking deserve” the joker meme when he dies. 
---
Haha. Miss doing stuff like that on my paladin. Or Devine interventioning someone.
---
Have you guys heard the alliance are being ganked by the horde alot?
---
I think if the Horde just took it down a notch or two, things would be fine. Having the TP fight path and MV flight path all the way to the chain on lockdown 24/7 is just insane. Like, even at 3 in the morning, there are horde camping it. And all the effort that these players are spending is going to go largely unrewarded.
---
It still boggles my mind that low pop alliance servers still have dozens/hundreds of horde players still camping these zones. They spend an hour getting 1 or 2 kills. Like... wtf? I love ganking, but nothing about that is fun. If I had to wait 20 minutes to find a target to gank, I would just hearth out and do literally anything else with my time.
---
The dedication for something so pointless and boring is incomprehensible to me. I almost wonder if a lot of these players are botting. I would not be surprised.
---
LOL
---
Yeah, people with lives that don’t want to spend 30 minutes getting their group to BRD. Shitty boomers, PVP happened on a PVP server, they’re fault for rolling PVP, there’s no overpopulation at all, nothing to see here. 
---
/s
---
Ah yeah whitemane is alright too, forgot about that one
---
Gear has always been this way. If you don’t care about being optimal then you don’t care but we have always chased the best items. And this predates wow. People even did this in Diablo.
---
Nostalrius and kronos. Sure i got ganked at the entrance of brm but raid out in the world? Nope
---
Tier gear has the most stam. Even for shadow pvp the stamina is worth more than going glass cannon +shadow damage
---
Other way around.
---
Pulling a mob off someone is harder if the mob is meleeing them, but getting aggro while being in melee isn't easier.
---
It's not an aggro generation bonus in melee, it's bonus aggro required to pull the mob off if the mob's target is in melee.
---
Honestly, guys that complain about mega servers have never played on a dead server before.  It's fcking blowyourbrains out stuff.
---
Please, do not complain about high server pops until you've experienced a dead server.  9 months of your life invested in your toon, no ability to transfer off.  And, you, just, quit.......  It's soul crushing.  
---
Worst part is, after you reroll on a high pop server, your decked out toon just sits there gathering dust while you stare at him on the login screen once in a while.
---
\#nodeadservers.
---
I have to give it a try. Seems like this can tank, heal, aoe farm, and pvp pretty effectively.
---
Without even knowing what it is, epics on retail go for tens of thousands because of their typically unique appearances and the whole collecting fad. Dumbass.
---
It sounds like it's you lagging. The latency shown doesn't update super quickly.
---
This hits the nail on the head exactly. 
---
This game is an MMO that is heavily interaction based. I’ve learnt many things by talking to others and having them explain it rather than watching some 20 min in depth video about it.
---
I much prefer asking someone on the chance they’re friendly and are willing to help. These kind of people make better guild mates and in turn make better friends throughout your time playing.
---
For example a hunter from my guild showed me the best tacs for Rhok hunter quest. I know he could have said “just watch a YouTube vid on it” but he didn’t. 
---
If you don’t want to lend a hand or offer some information don’t even bother typing. “Just google it” is like a virtual fuck you I can’t be arsed to many.
---
Massively Multiplayer*
---
druids number one at solo for survivability? Bahahahahah!.  Bahahahahhahahahahahanah
---
I'm afraid transfers from Noggenfogger are horde only at the moment.
---
&gt;Currently pyroblassting
---
Most hover around 6k, which is around double what it was. That’s * a lot more*.
---
Would you be willing to share the configuration you are using for the comparison? I used the spreadsheet and classic sim and in all my attempts combat dagger ended up 2,5-3,5 % better than sword combat.
---
I am really curious to see the difference and I might be able to find some errors in my thinking.
---
Regarding cross realm bgs, they say there will be on the FAQ: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23090136/world-of-warcraft-classic-faq-what-you-need-to-know
---
Battlegrounds, raids and leveling / gearing alts. There will always be things to do for those who truly like the game, and a lot of people do. The population will decline for sure, and some servers may die, but the big ones will have a high population for a very long time. I think Blizzard made too many servers at launch, but that can always be rectified with merges and paid transfers.
---
Ultimately it's going to depend on how fun BGs are, because that's the only content that isn't truly repetitive and doesn't have an endpoint. If BGs are fun then there will be a dedicated player base  that sticks around indefinitely, 100%
---
Except a large amount of the people who bitched about the "community" aspect of the game don't want a community aspect.  They want people available to allow them to play how they want when they want.  Those bitching about sharding/layering are also those bitching about classic now because they don't know what they actually want beyond being able to do what they want when they want and how they want.  Anything which disrupts this is proof of how blizzard is mismanaging the game, whether it be classic or retail.
---
People not transferring from high pop servers is to blame
---
TSM
---
Me too

And here I am, leveling with shield...

" Melee distance players would need to do 110% of the threat of the currently-tanking player to pull aggro, and ranged distance players would need to do 130% of the threat. "

Something to note about DHC, it's proc can break Scatter Shot, so if that's important to you I would use the crossbow.

---
/yell “I call forth a steed of nightmare!”
---
You are correct but people are downvoting because you aren't explaining why it's wrong.
---
Its a factor, sure.
---
But I would say horde will be more PvP centric from the get-go, because people will roll horde for their racials.
---
I play alliance warlock, I woudln't play it voluntarily because its shit in comparison. Can't fear undeads at all (in most situations) and orc has 1/4 chance of resisting it anyways.
---
Alliance are completely viable in PvP vanilla, I would even give them an overall edge. But Alliance advantage comes from having superior organized PvP squads (like 5 mans teams,or even 40v40) not 1v1, 2v2 etc.
---
If alliance actually pvped while lvling, and got used to it. They wouldn't have reached 60 before they realised they made a mistake and is now completely shell-shocked by PvP.
---
And most servers aren't 80/20 or nearly that bad, most are slightly better than 40/60 ish (still not ideal, but definitely playable)
---
This is true but despawn seems to be pretty long. I was running with no mount some pretty good distances on some.  Still better than straight up losing it with no options.
---
It was the exact opposite of a personal anecdote, it was a fundamental description of the source data. I did say the phrase "I have seen" but I wasn't saying that "I have seen horde people and alliance people say this", I was saying "I have seen the numbers from the data at a place." By this logic, every possible experience with data would be an anecdote because at some point "That's just your personal experience with looking at the spreadsheet" no the spreadsheet is filled with data not anecdotes, as are the discord surveys. Buncha AMATEUR data scientist wannabes on the horde here, go back to sharpening your bone spears in your hide yurt zug zug
---
Isn't the chest from Dire Maul tribute better?
---
Dead servers wouldn’t exist if Blizzard wasn’t afraid to merge when needed. It’s not a perfect solution, but it’s better than letting 2 half-full servers coexist separately.
---
Darkmoon Faire is Phase 3, "early 2020."
---
I only played a couple months before BC, but horde always had more people in my anecdotal experience.
---
Am I setting myself up for failure leveling with dual wield Fury build on a PvP server? I'm keeping 2H leveled as I go, but I'd love to play dual wield at end game. I know popular opinion is swap to Fury at 40 but anyone done it before hand?
---
GL man keep trucking along to 60 so you can quit like me
---
Rogues are still top for honor farming in P2. No one else has as many options just due to stealth. Being able to camp just about anywhere and get full honor is a Rogue or Druid thing but much easier as a Rogue due to the speed of which you can kill people and get away.
---
I think it depends on the question. A lot of things are easily and quickly answered by searching the internet, so people often expect someone to do that first (or to have an addon that gives them the answer). People are open to more confusing or advanced questions usually. I have never had someone laugh at me or be rude for asking a question, so I'm curious in what sorts of situations this happened.
---
Nah. Savage glad chain is BIS for a hot minute
---
Didn't you know, everything is warrior loot?
---
The more I talk to people in this thread, the more I think I should be tab sundering more than I do. Currently I tab sunder sometimes, and always as skull target approaches death so I can begin building a larger threat lead on the next skull. This, in addition to spamming BS, has made it very comfortable for me to keep AoE threat on multiple targets. I’ve also found that simply spamming battle shout allows me to keep aggro even without tab sundering at all. However, this could be a sub-optimal way to hold AoE threat, and I will try not spamming BS at all after the two I do on pull to initially establish threat.
---
&gt;  what we expect of each other 
---
What do you expect of strangers?
---
Well I disagree with that.
---
I played tbc/wotk entirely just for raids. I farmed just enough for consumables, I farmed my dungeons for items and raided the endgame content wiping there.
---
Because everything is so easy right now playing classic like that is simply impossible and there are many pve only people out there.
---
many people don't see that because they sort by 'new' instead of 'hot'  to avoid stupid meme posts.  (it's a sad fact that many stupid meme posts get lots of votes, so they end up in the 'hot' list
---
Balls. They were open for Alliance a few weeks ago. Should have done it then.
---
Really really struggling as a Warlock against mages. All their spells seem to be instant and do a ton of damage, basically they blast me down in a few seconds. I am SM/Ruin Warlock, 3.5k health and 4.8k mana (blue dungeon gear as I can’t raid ... yet) 
---
Any tips or strategies? The internet isn’t really helpful so far. 
---
What I’m already doing:
---
- always have spell-stone equipped and ready to use
---
- keep felhunter close l, try to initially dispel mages frost shield though
---
- try to bait a silence with a fire spell but very often they get me anyways on my fear cast
---
I feel like I’m very vulnerable to burst damage  by any class for example Warriors as well (fear immune a lot of the time because of some berserk spell) or rogues. Would it be a good idea to walk around with void walker instead to mitigate the initial burst with sacrifice? But then I have no devour magic/spell lock or seduce available. 
---
I’m really thankful for any tactic advice.
---
Arcanite Reaper-Alliance 2 guys sell them for 100-250g plus mats...
---
Yeah, 40/60 is about as good as it gets for most servers. That’s still the dominant faction having 50% more people than the other, which is a big chunk. Then compound that with overpopulation, and one faction will spend a lot more time dead than the other.
---
Unless you're a hunter!
---
That's silly. People are playing classic because they didn't like the expansions. If they did.... just play retail?
---
How much will AV Epic mount cost once you have grinded the reputation to become exalted?
---
That's just like... your opinion man.
---
Honestly though, there is HUGE demand for a tbc server because it is the expansion a lot of people have a lot of deep feelings about. Don't get me wrong, vanilla is THE shit and I wouldn't change a thing about it or even want to rush to TBC. But saying that it would be their biggest mistake is pretty hyperbolic honestly.
---
It was the bot. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with reddit lately. Post content too short? Deleted. No flair? Deleted. Just let me fucking post

---
Thanks for taking the time to reply.
---
If you're on a PvE server its a nice quality of life upgrade. If you're on a well populated PvP server it's paramount. You're going to get chased down everywhere you go, your raid is going to leave you behind running into BRM/Ony, etc. I play on Faerlina, a significant number of raid groups across the faction including my own require an epic mount.
---
Luckily you play a priest, so knocking out 900g isn't going to be much of a problem. Learn to lasher farm and spend a week doing it. You'll be fine.
---
This is true. Constantly using death wish, blood rage, and being in close proximity to aoe damage from bosses.
---
&gt;Especially when I want to experience the game myself, not watch 30minute videos to maybe, maybe, find the answers I need. 
---
Stop doing research with videos lol...
---
Most questions you might have can be found with a quick google search and you can ctrl-f right to the answer
---
you think the French had the superior army?
---
speaking for myself, i love reading/watching guides while im on the go, but when i’m playing i just can’t get myself to click through a 20 min video about dm n solo farms searching for a minor info like idk which talents to choose so i rather ask. 
---
another good example is the in dreams quest which i just started just to see my man taelan in the dirt after pulling the guards as well as the pat outside so i looked it up and needed like 10 mins to find out what to do in an old wowhead comment. the game is old and everything is solved ofc but you know, there are so many little things in classic which are really specific and fucking up often results in heavy penalties. these kind of penalties lead to people being overly careful and asking „easy“ questions i guess. though i have to say, comparing to retail, the classic community has been really helpful to me so far and i love it. there is of course the classic neckbeard that defines himself over wow knowledge but, as far as my experience went, he gets outnumbered by the helpful dudes/duderine
---
Hunter op mate, only real struggle is warlock/spriest.
---
Yes but this time I'm France. I don't want to be France.
---
7 days left til you can argue about something else. better make them count i guess?
---
Here's a spreadsheet I made a while back. You can put in your current int, sp, crit, and hit as well as buffs and it will show the value of each stat vs 1 sp. It also converts them to equivalency points for use with sixtyupgrades.com

I am playing Shazzrah H now. I chose H months ago. But things are going downhill with faction balance. So I think it's time to reroll, especially if cross-realm bgs are going to take place. I don't want to be waiting years for a pop.
---
Just find another tank.  I get this tank wants gold for his time if he doesn't need anything from the dungeon.  Nothing wrong with that.  
---
It just personally leaves a bad taste in my mouth so go farm something else while you wait for another tank.
---
Imagine being this upsetti spaghetti about pvp.
---
Oh shit, that first clip tho
---
MY ZERKER BUFF NOW BOI
---
Yes, that agrees with I said.
---
He probably has a stream dedicated to it, with 4 followers.
---
this is the worst advice I've seen in a while, please refrain from misguiding new players
---
You ever consider your server might be more balanced than most?
---
what happened to your crown vic?
---
Yes it is possible.
---
1. For overpower I'd say it's worth it for level and pvp, sometimes in raiding, but not always due to rage loss. Revenge meh, if you are tanking you are often in defensive stance anyway since there's a bonus threat gen in that stance
---
2. There are weakauras that track overpower, probably revenge too, I would be most conerned about overpower. But it's easy to see if enemy uses dodge then overpower ready
---
3. I would refrain from using stance macros
---
Its not ideal, but its not at a ratio where alliance can't hold their ground anywhere, and that the horde should own IF/Menethil.
---
And if the alliance makes some PvP guilds/raid squads. Fills them up with a shitton of paladins, warriors and mages they will just annihalate anything they come across.
---
Paladins are by far the most valuable PvP healers in vanilla, and if they put freedom on warriors/mages(in large AoE battles) they have the edge.
---
I 've played both factions, and alliance twice on 2 different servers, and I find way more difficult to get the alliance to start interacting in PvP situations compared to on the horde. And even my horde character is on a horde minority server.
---
I have the first two but if you can get something else and get black hands breadth is probably better
---
There's a gnome mage on herod who I'm 99% convinced is a bot, he just resurrects in Org and 3 minute mage's some poor pvp flagged sap, dies and then repeats.
---
Been there for weeks now.
---
Also last night I saw a coordinated group of 5-6 mages all rezzing at once and throwing out burst instants in Kargath.  Many an Ony buff were lost last night.
---
Proud of you!
---
that shamans standing on the water :D
---
If any alliance player on herod wants to test this out, I'll kill your eye on my alt to test it out. I'll prob be on around 10pm server time tonight
---
&gt; Of course, Battlegrounds are here in a week, and that should alleviate the problems to an extent. But still, there will be ganking out in the open world, to an extent that shouldnt exist. Yes, it will get better than it is now, but if the population doesn’t shrink, it will still be worse than it should. And I want this game to succeed.
---
I see you didn’t read that paragraph. I’m complaining about the same thing ive been complaining about since the beta came out.
---
This is the main issue. There are three times as many playing on each realm as Vanilla. I'm looking for a low pop realm to roll on and there aren't any.
---
I really edited my post check it out 
---
Z-tribe is a great option ,  and also very active in people organizing different stuff on the server
---
Very pleased that I rolled on this server, honestly one of the better balanced servers you can choose from.
---
I can agree here mostly on off-meta specs, but I do think that after making their own decision for themselves on what to play, people could benefit a lot from researching on how to play it to the fullest. I share the sentiment on guides though - every wowhead dungeon guide for leveling basically tells hybrid classes to fuck off at the top of the guide. Many hybrid classes only fall behind in end-game raiding scenarios, where fight length or debuff limit is their bane.
---
Go Hunter. Both are great for solo leveling, but Hunter is much more noob friendly, whereas playing a warlock takes time and dedication to do it properly.
---
&gt; Tanks are in high demand 
---
i like how ppl keep saying this as if it absolves ppl of their shitty behavior.
---
Who cares...its a fake currency which, somehow, seems ALOT easier to get your hands on than 15 years ago.
---
Your queue won't be impacted because servers are cross-realm, but it will probably be shorter for the alliance in general.
---
And your server really is trash in terms of faction ratio, 29% alliance. Might as well be playing a PvE server.
---
Really? Cuz at least 1v1 mages very rarely beat me
---
Cause google is a thing?
---
The only \[problem\] that exists is the \[problem\] you brought with you.
---
Not a single mage interaction/fight. I didn't look specifically for other classes, but I noticed no shaman, or rogue either.
---
I guess getting purged, earthshocked, grounding totem and rez at graveyard doesnt make the cut.
---
Its more off a look how much damage I can do video and not a real pvp one, but that was just boring.
---
I'm alliance yes but he does it with a priest aswell. I'm not sure how but if you want I could ask
---
Why is it strawman argument? Killing afk or low health players as they zone in, is equally one sided as a level 60 killing level 20ies.
---
Bonus weekends shouldn’t be a thing until AB(phase 4).
---
Interface Options -&gt; Names -&gt; Nameplate Motion Type to Stacking Nameplates
---
Zucker is sugar in germanish.
---
No and I didn’t even make note of the guild doing the raid. The spys name was something like Daevish though.
---
fucking got em'
---
because they're used to fighting solo against 3+ horde opponents?
---
They are about 1/3 smaller than what the ideal population would be.
---
I want your addons package..
---
Hulk Hogan, is that you?
---
Thanks
---
There is a tangible difference between Horde and Alli when it comes to transportation ganking, too. Horde get guards that will kill your reputation if you kill them. Otherwise there might be more of the opposite problem on horde zeps.
---
It’s really not. Granted, MV and TP have very little cover. I was joking with my guild that if these zones just had some damn trees like in STV, 90% of the complaining would stop. Hell, one time in vanilla, I ran around a tree to avoid a skull orc warrior in duskwood, and he straight up gave up after a minute of me running around that damn tree. I wish engineering could make smoke grenades that obscure players within a certain vision or something like that. Just a tiny bit of cover is enough to gain a 20 second lead on someone even if they have you out mounted.
---
You think it's that simple?  Both servers need to be in the same region, same time zone, have countering faction balances etc.  What about name changes?  You want to be forced to change your name?
---
ROFL at this comment.
---
Nice!!!
---
its really not shitty behavior. step into their shoes. why would you play with me, if playing with someone else is more beneficial to you?
---
you dont know me and you dont owe me anything. so why?
---
I scrolled too far to see the homage.
---
It will never get better. The only reason I play alliance is to test the limit of my masochism and the hopelessness of realizing that you wasted hours crawling dead repeatedly to BRD/BRS
---
Should have rolled on pve but no time commitment to grind another account with all the real life commitment
---
Most servers concurrent online is exactly around 3k now.
---
It depends what they are.  On a frost mage you want to spellstone their nova so they can't shatter combo you.  If they cold snap to try it again, spell devour it.  I probably wouldn't worry about the frost shield until you get some control in the fight.
---
Baiting fear is risky.  I just throw up dots, immolate and spam searing.
---

---
I'm not a particularly good warlock though.  It's one thing to know the theory but I seem to have a terrible time applying it.
---
Ye, tried that place. Can only recommend it for non-physical damage dealers though. The crabs between the murlocs got so much fucking armor.
---
I helped the lock farm an Eye of Shadow and we were friends for a bit, assisting each other with runs. Even afterward, we'd whisper each other when we were online and talk shop. He had the recipe from a guild run, so he passed it over.
---
Developing those types of relationships, not luck, got me the robes. Ironically, the Exalted robes dropped for me about 1 hour after I crafted Truefaith (I'd already run a number of times with no drop).
---
God, I love classic
---
Care to explain why then?
---
&gt;I've been told it's rude to tell someone posting to /1 with super basic questions what the answer is and that they should google it next time.
---
Hope you aren't on an RP server, you'd probably get banned.
---
6k is just for only a couple of servers, and all of them were mentioned in several Blizzard warnings and people were asked to transfer from them.
---
Genius!
---
By your 30ap = 1 crit the hunter chest is better.
---
Talents making crit better is irrelevant since there is no talentless baseline to work with. Any caster and warriors have a crit talent too. Not sure about rogue.
---
Mods on any reddit ftfy.
---
Hardly shitty behavior to ask people to make ot worth your time if its not something u want to tank, lots of people are actually happy to give away the vendor loot if it means they get a clean dungeon run done now instead of 1-3 hours after forming group
---
640g or 10g
---
Nobody really knows atm, it depends what version of the game they are going to use for the price.  It was originally 640 and dropped to 10 around TBC release.
---
Most mobs in MC are immune to fire, which means you’ll miss out on DHC procs. The xbow is slower, which creates higher crit damage and lines up better with aimed/auto rotation. I’m going with xbow until I get my leaf.
---
It is not required for all 15k to be online at one time to fuck up a server. Just that fact that 15k people play on the server screws with many aspects of the game. Primarily resources. There are no where near enough herbs/ore/gems and such to supply the server making everything way to costly. Then throw in faction imbalance, like on Heartseeker or Herod, and everything goes to complete shit. 3k is roughly the old concurrent cap, and on those servers resources were scarce. Now double that concurrent and triple to quintuple the active player base? Yeah, it screws EVERYTHING up. Arcane crystals are double to triple what they were in Vanilla. We actually used them MORE in Vanilla than we do now in Classic. People crafted Arcanite Reaper and such back then. Lionheart being the best thing ever for warriors was not an unsolved mystery. All of us were using it. That is just one example.
---
1. Maybe. If agro isn't an issue and you want to kill faster, then switch.
---
2. Add-on called "weak auras", or just watch for a dodge to pop up over the enemy. Or for revenge, a dodge/parry/block over your portrait.
---
3. There is rarely a case where you would want to do this with revenge specifically.  the only reason I could think of is if you have Improved Revenge and just really want a stun.  The general form, though, is:
---
/cast \[nostance:X\] &lt;Stance Name&gt;
---
/cast &lt;ability name&gt;
---
where X is the numerical value \[1, 2, 3\] of the stance (as ordered above your abilities).  Stance name is whatever stance you want to use the ability in.  Sometimes you have a choice.  You can and should do this with most of your abilities.
---
Well, to that I say.
---
Fuck honor points, kill them anyways.
---
I kill people to kill them, not for some imaginary points (altough I think the titles system is cool tho).
---
And I'd also add again, if a server was 50/50 perfectly balanced, I'd still say there would be a significant higher portion of PvP players on the horde due to their racials.
---
wow, is it really like that now? I've played my fair share of mmo's and the social aspect is more or less the only reason to play. If you strip out the chat banter or information sharing, then all that's left is the game part which can be pretty boring.
---
Honestly mostly etiquette stuff or something that I didn't quite understand in group settings. Happened more than once that I had somebody whisper me after the others would make their jokes. Maybe it's just my bad luck with other players, but at this point I'm dreading doing dungeons. I get it if nobody wants to babysit the noob and I do a lot of research in advance for precisely this reason, but more often than not, the interactions I have arent very positive.
---
I remember the initial release of the wowhead pre-bis guide was fucking terrible, but it seems to have been updated. I just took a look and the P2 is pretty accurate. I wouldn't use a Maiden's Circle over Rosewine Circle, or Magiskull Cuffs over Sublime Wristguards. Everything else looks accurate though.
---
This is true of some people it’s also true some tanks don’t want to play with entitled players.
---
So im one of these people, I prefer to ask other people answers to questions that could be googled etc if I have people readily available. If you know the right answer and could answer me in 1 minute of typing, why would I logically spend 10 minutes googling something?
---
Of course this widely varies with the question... like what level do I get execute as a warrior is much easier to google than, hey what's the name of the quest that starts at the second cauldron farm in wpl?
---
Furthermore I personally prefer to view wow as a social experience and why would I choose to talk to a bot instead of a player?
---
Sgc would only pull ahead if 1crit was worth 32 ap or more. Meaning it's a waste of time farming it imo and warriors should farm it so I would leave it to one.
---
Respec to disc 31/20.
---
Can't say the naughty f word in this christian subreddit!
---
For real though, I saw this post before and it seems to have been removed, so it's probably got to do with that.
---
I did that, sold it for 15g on Gehennas. People still give me grief for it.
---
Not to mention thanks to layering and layer hopping it was very easy to avoid pvp in any form.
---
Is he the one on the top floor?
---
Liar. Clearly you care enough to respond. 
---
And BGs will be great for Horde whiners but Alliance will still have to deal with Horde rankers who are waiting in the 20, 30, or 60 minute queues. 
---
The solution here is not battlegrounds. The solution is that people will quit from being farmed and people will drop out because the honor grind is too real and people will drop out for random reasons. Eventually we will get to a situation where the servers aren't so overcrowded and the players will be comfortable with their rank and **then** the experience will be improved.
---
Hey look you can kill people who are just passing by in level 14 greens! You’re so good
---
Gnomes don't deserve respect
---
They sold for 10g on Atiesh Horde the other day. I had AH alerts set up and saw an email pop up, logged in ASAP and they were gone. I whispered the guy, he had no idea what they were but told me "They sold really fast!"
---
This is a very simplistic way of thinking. Banishes, polymorphs, stuns, flamewalkers turning and fireballing all happen out of a tanks control.
---
Hell even in guild runs I often let a rogue go loose on the caster add in a pack of 4+ while I take care of the other 3
---
Honestly, the only time I made it to BRD without dying was going from Thelsamar through the tunnel. Thorium Point and the path to BRM is covered with honor farmers. Running into hordes just going to do a dungeon run themselves isn't that big of a deal. Even if you die they're not going to camp on your corpse for when you spawn
---
😔
---
Are you just not tab cycling at all?  For the most part you want to charge &gt; TC &gt; Defensive &gt; (Revenge if up) &gt; Tab Sunder/Revenge/Shield Slam (this is assuming you have tactical mastery, if not the opener is a bit different.)  If you're pulling a 6+ pack it isn't unreasonable to expect a DPS to tank one for a little bit.  If the pack contains non-elites prioritize putting sunders on the elites first (like the opening packs in Strath.)  For the most part you should be fighting for threat with the DPS not the healers.
---
Half the pulls in strat youre LoS pulling not charging in.
---
But Shadowform :-D
---
It's not shitty behavior. It's recognizing your worth to pugs. 
---
If I'm gonna tank something like live strat which I have pretty much no reason to go to. I want to make sure it's worth my time so I may reserve the first orb that drops. Or do something similar to what op is talking aboit.
---
Being a prot spec tank is horrible for world farming. Selling your services  to pugs is  the best  way to make gold for a prot warrior.
---
I have a couple of exceptions but generally this is very true.  You also might want /dismount and /startattack in some of them as well.
---
1100 here.
---
get burned gnome lmao
---
The real question is if Blizzard is running 1.13 on 2.01 mechanics or if they've faithfully stuck to 1.12 mechanics for this ability.
---
If it's the former, then they nerfed the shit out of it and it's useful initially. 
---
If it's the latter, then it's likely more efficient than sunder armor for threat generation.
---
Always document your code, kids!
---
Good lord. I'm on level 30 of stubbornly leveling as prot and the grind is real.
---
You want 310, I don't know where did you get this arbitrary number of 308 but there is the same difference between 307 and 308 that there is between 308 and 309 regarding % dmg on glancing blows as far as I know
---
If you play against shit players sure.
---
You still can. It's only been 4 months.
---
Not exactly. They used the phase "week of December 10" and if you recall they used the same language for the honor system which didn't go live until Thursday.
---
I dunno man. I started playing wow with classic and whenever i asked people to go slow or just explain something i was never met with ridicule what so ever. More people need to be comfortable with speaking up loll.
---
Fastest path is to run straight down the hole and run up the other side
---
One shotting people with arcane/fire in a capital city has no relationship with server balance. You could literally be the only person on your faction and it would still work.
---
1. Use AP/PoM/Pyro macro.  
---
2. Die.   
---
3. Wait 3 minutes (for cooldowns).  
---
4. Wait until you see a pvp flagged clothie.   
---
5. Rez, and repeat.
---
I only have 25 points in holy and I don't even need mana pots in MC
---
of course i didnt. all the complaints atm are basically the same walls of text.
---
I don't know. Could you repeat the question?
---
A single Rogue with Prep will be able to kill you without you being able to fight back unless he’s shit.
---
&gt;	maybe vanilla isn't for you.
---
Oh do shut up.
---
I am not saying they should not wear it, at all. But a pala has the full range of armor items available to them, priest for instance has only cloth.
---
int
---
Are we talking about tanking?  If so...that's not really a tanking trinket.  Mark of the Chosen is way better.
---
I'm not even sure that's the best threat trinket, that's probably Rune Guard of the Captain to get the hit to the cap.
---
It really seems like blizz learned nothing from bringing the Nostalrius guys in to chat with them.
---
I feel like the only they took away was "We can make money off this."
---
Do these buffs stack with regular food buffs?  Or do they overwrite any other buffs?
---
Yea in Classic people are nice, especially in dungeons because many people can't remember themselves at first how to do them. But Retail is very different.
---
I recently took a free transfer on one of my alt toons to a alliance dominated server. It’s bliss. I didn’t have to reroll. I’m gonna try to transfer back to my old server if they ever have paid transfers. But if not I’m still happy I transferred cuz I wasn’t ganked or camped once while running to brd today. Yay!
---
Strikers Mark and Blastershot are both worse for hunters than Carapace spine due to their speed being way too fast. They should go to melee as stat sticks since all of your hunters will have Rhok anyway long before melee get their ranged weapons.
---
Mods on any online forum always abuse their power and think they’re more important than they are.
---
Like wow, you’re gonna talk shit after you ban and silence me for something that somehow classifies as “hate speech”? So brave.
---
All anyone is asking for is for people to be **competent**.  Basically know your class and have a decent understanding of how others play.
---
For example, as a dps, you have a responsibility to manage your aggro just like the tank has a responsibility to manage theirs.  Don't go full tilt at the start of a pull and then complain when you get hit.
---
If the healer has 25% mana, it's not a good idea for a tank to go charging in.
---
Someone get's it!
---
What is your point of view of stance macros? Why would you suggest not to do it ?
---
They to get the s n d off before they die so not to waste points.  If you already have combo points on them.
---
On my Disc Priest wearing 4/5 Necropile and 2/8 Dreadmist for solo-PvP, I have 4k HP unbuffed going up to 4700 HP with 2/2 Imp. Fortitude. With 3/3 Imp. Inner Fire my armor gives ~33% physical damage reduction. I have zero fear of Rogues 1v1 even if they're Undead.
---
For group-PvP healing I ditch the Dreadmist and put on more T1 gear, prioritizing Int over +Healing. My most used spells here are Dispel, PW:S, and Mana Burn which have either none or very little scaling with +Healing and our max rank heals do plenty enough on their own for PvP. You can PI yourself if you need more out of your heals.
---
I've got revenge on people that ganked me while questing in ashenvale.  Yeah.  People hold grudges.
---
"Everyone gets camped at the end of the day."
---
Ha ha!
---
Was 46 the day phase 2 was released, I'm 57 now as a warrior.  it's been... an experience.
---
Of course, THAT'S the thing you don't like about it. Haha, you Frenchie!
---
Honestly just keep going... I watch TV now while I level and just assume I will get ganked once every 30 minutes.  I just do my corpse run while watching and start doing my quest again and don't engage (mainly because it's almost always a skull that I can't touch anyways).  I just assume leveling is going to take forever for the alt.
---
That being said my best advice it to level in instances (SM, ZF, Mara, ST, BRD, LBRS, UBRS, Scholo, Strat) as you go through your levels to get some good uninterrupted time.  Also if your schedule allows I have found playing off-hours works pretty well.   I made great progress (almost a full level) the other night from 10pm - 12:30am server time on my alt.
---
The argument about rolling PvE isn't valid to me because if someone legitimately wants to PVP they should be on a PVP server.  The problem with that notion is that if you aren't already 60 on a PVP server than life is miserable and leveling is almost impossible.  I have a level 37 alt that is a Priest and what I am running across leveling isn't really even what I would consider PVP.  I am fine with same levels fighting as it's a challenge, you have a chance to win, etc...  But 95% of all my PVP deaths right now leveling are from Skull level people that make a point to come to Duskwood or STV and just one shot people twenty levels below them.  Those people just like causing grief - it's not a challenge to them.
---
Most guilds take 1 shadow priest specifically for the shadow weaving debuff to boost their warlock DPS in my experience.
---
I think we have 2 SP in our guild, at least at raiding level.  We accept them for what they want to play.
---
Oh ok. I might just suggest saying first you're new to MMORPG's and may have some newbie questions, so please bear with me. People will be much more receptive to that if they know going in what to expect from you. And if someone is impatient and being a jerk, at least they have a chance to leave group before you all get to the dungeon.
---
I said IF you Afk FOR 100% of the time, not that he dies 100% of the time if you afk. That means even 1 buff or right click will save him. But just staying AFK 100% of the time, WITHOUT doing anything, he won't always survive, it happend to me and was a waste of time because i listened to passive AFK players.
---
cuz u play the game for fun
---
&gt; 3.5k health
---
My priest has this much hp in blues/and a t1 piece.
---
I don't know warlocks that well, but I feel like you should have more stam?
---
General statement is that raid gear isn't the best pvp gear, you want to stack more stam.
---
No one is criticizing the people trying to figure out the game for themselves but if youre asking other people the answer to a question because you think that's a more authentic experience than googling it, you're wrong.
---
Maybe if you are bad
---
what makes being rewarded less for the same amount of time spent fun?
---
We used to run 4 warlocks + one shadow priest in a grp on pservers, and it worked out really well.
---
The spriest and locks buffs each others damage, and the spriest will heal the warlocks continously while they are lifetapping. So its basically an "infinite" sustain type of group, that can just be ignored by the healers and be their own little squad.
---
The problem is that warlocks doing much damage might wipe the fucking due to threat, but it does feel really good tho.
---
I meant, IF you afk 100% of the time(not doing anything, no buffs, no help) he dies, that happend to me. Maybe sometimes he survives, but saying that if you Afk everything will work out is fake news and waste of Peoples time.
---
it used to be good enough to just say orange man bad  but now you need your passport and another form of ID displayed whilst insulting orange man to not be banned
---
I just made a /4 window for my chat that only deal with LFG stuff vs clicking the channel on and off.
---
I agree, but then again I think it should be on the bis list.
---
A good rogue, yes. 90% of rogues are shit, though.
---
It's called gambling and I think loot boxes had a big part to play in this shift of mentality.
---
I bought a new gaming comp for the first time in a long time to treat myself, and I booted up Subnautica, something I hadn't played in a long time and not on a good computer. My god... the fun I've been re-experiencing in that game is off the charts and it has nothing to do with the drive to "get stuff".
---
A quick look at Ironforge.pro proves you entirely wrong. In the America region the majority of servers are well above the original ~3k server cap.
---
The only servers that aren't are the ones they added after launch.
---
Nerds love flexing their useless knowledge. 
---
Roll a female troll or female human, act cute, and tell the party you've never done something before. People will help you out ez.
---
Call it what you want, but I simply won't run dungeons if there's no reason to go. Most people realize that and don't get upset when I ask for this, especially since I'm spending way more money on a dungeon than they are. Even on a slow week I'm spending 50-60g on repair bills, and that obviously goes up more if I'm spending my time running dungeons every time someone whispers me. 
---
Alternatively, I'll just sit in IF spamming my blacksmithing/engineering macros while you look for a tank. Either way I'm happy, but one of those results in you getting to play the game, and the other doesn't. I'll let you take your pick.
---
That is true for non-bg content. But once BG's enter the play their honor gain is massively higher and favor warriors and mages who are more durable and can stay in combat longer. 
---
The first Rank 14 in classic I believe was a druid, who camped Zepps. But P2 won't be around long enough for that to be possible. I don't understand why anyone is bothering with rank up now. Once BG's enter the play you can rank up from rank 1 in a fraction of the time because it's more efficient. Rogues aren't good at BG's. They're too squishy and dependent on CD's that you don't reliably have.
---
I recall leveling my warrior in AV during vanilla from 51-60, I guess it changed huh?
---
While true, that doesn't look like boxing. They are in a line, not in a group as normal, and it's hard to tell from this quick clip, but I'm not sure if that's /follow, or if it's just them all following the same pathing. Would have to see them actually interact with anything to be sure.

Refusing to use the AH at all is seriously going to gimp you IMO.  I have friends that do this and they're always bitching about not having any money.

Just get auctionator and set your auctions for no longer than 8 hrs, never EVER 24 hrs.  The deposit is higher and you're certainly going to be undercut in that time period.  Also let auctionator tell you what you should vendor and what you should post as far as trade goods.  If you're only going to clear a few silver then don't bother.  Learn what greens people want and level an alt to 5 to disenchant everything else.
---
You don't have to master it or camp it constantly... just use it appropriately.

---
It's a shit stigma but it has a reason it exists, as you've said, mana efficiency is awful.... However, we use a shadow priest in our raids just to empower our warlocks under the circumstances the player understands why he is there, and that most shadow related bits of gear will go to the warlocks over the shadow priest. Such as the belt from majordormu, I forget the name.

TL;DR Find a guild that wants to utilise your debuff for warlocks! :D

It's not the worst way to get some cheap weapon skill points, tbh.

Arcane crystals are one of the worst example to show as open world resource since they aren't open world resource at all, just go to dme and farm to your heart content.

The one and only viable example you may use is black lotus.

Which is going to be balanced by world economy anyway.
---
A lot has been stripped from Retail to make it more casual friendly, so people can hop in to do quick content and then log out if there's not much time to play.

I mean..there’s like 1/10th of the content currently released so I don’t know why this is surprising.

Theres no good 50/50 PVP servers afaik. I hear Heartseeker is super alliance heavy if you want, I hear it's just the same situation with the factions flipped though.

RPPVP servers appear a bit more balanced but I've heard lots of hardcore PVPers rolled on those servers and as a result RPers are really hurting for actual RP over honor farmers.

You face bad mages. 1v1 mages will win against most people unless it's against a rogue who jumped them. Rogues are unbeatable in 1v1 if they get the jump and can control the fight. But, that being said, if a mage can get an opening the rogue is done. Period. Once the mage has you slowed it's hard to catch up to him and they'll whittle you down. Why do you think mages can solo packs of higher level elites in pve? They never touch him. We know that now. The reason that mages weren't as big in vanilla was the frost spec balance overhaul happened late into the game.
---
Can you point me towards a guide for a twink hunter? Im maining a rogue so I’m thinking about a second class to BG with

That's kind of stupid.   There was a screenshot showing that the Eye is a "Civilian" and the status quo is that Civilians give DK's.   Look at that, I used the same dumb logic but in a way that actually makes sense to prove the opposite of your point.
---
I know you agree with me otherwise you'd be a hypocrite.
---
Thank you all for the feedback. Very helpful.
---
I am sorry, how does a project pulling data from warcraftlogs show you a concurrent online?
---
Pretty sure the meta is 2h fury till 40 and swap to arms or just arms all he way to 60. Fury is ok for open world pve but arms wins out if you ever do dungeons/cleave (either as tank or DPS) or in 1v1 PVP action.
---
Changed way later.

I didn’t say you could do it every time.   I simply said that I was able to do it by afking, and that you were wrong in what you said (even if it’s not what you meant)
---
I don't quite understand this about jump runs however... I always have tanks in my guild asking people to go on jump runs so it's my understanding a tank can't just go on a jump run by themselves but need a full group of five.  I've stopped going because the tanks expect four of us to make the trek over to DM, deal with getting into the instance around the gank squads and then they expect to take any and all arcane crystals they get.
---
In that respect I feel like people should turn the tables on the tanks or whoever (assumption is a miner) is trying to put a jump run together and expect them to compensate the group for the arcane crystals they get.
---
Great answer man. Thanks a lot! 
---
Now I just need to remap the keys a bit, but the comment above covered that well :)
---
Happy hunting!

Considering my LW is already pretty close to the level to craft Nightscape, this is something I can look forward to, and I've already begun planning for it. Thank you.

Can someone explain how to restore a destroyed item please?

With 2k players the world feels largely empty. Player with 12k players on a WOTLK private server and it was overcrowded. Played with 4k players on a private TBC server and the world felled empty.  Once BG are added, I think 5K is the sweet spot for classic.
---
Hm, dunno I am trying to get high stam stuff but that’s the only dungeon gear that dropped for me so far. Have 4 of t0 set (head, hands, belt, wrist) and 2 of the scholo necro set (pants, shoulder), they tend to be high stam. Been unlucky with a few drops as well, couldn’t get my hands on the high stam necklace from strath and high stam shoulders from scholo, etc.

Feral druid question
---
When in the melee group on Ragnaros, having a mana bar will cause problems - this is known.
---
I'm wondering if there is any risk to using an instantenous powershifting macro during the fight. My powershifting macro cancels form and shifts back in in a single GCD. I never see my mana bar. In fact I have to use weakauras to track my mana because the bar truly never shows. Will this count as a mana bar showing and potentially nuking the melee group?
---
Lmfao serves him right. So OP that they can Just bubble and hearth.
---
bro you learned the word toxic and stopped learning after that and it shows.
---
Cannot stress this response enough. Between leveling blacksmithing, and buying the rare recipes early in the game(meaning there were almost none on the AH at the time) I spent 600-700g on blacksmithing. I've definitely made that money back now, but a large part of that came from being one of the first on the server with elemental sharpening stones recipe. If I didn't have that recipe, then I doubt I'd have even broken even on blacksmithing yet. 
---
Overall, it's one of the hardest professions to consistently make money at, and I've talked to multiple blacksmiths on my server who say they regret choosing it as one of their professions. I would not recommend blacksmithing at this stage of the game, because it's unlikely you'll ever turn a profit. Something like engineering costs 1/3rd as much as to level, while simultaneously being useful on a personal level. 
---
Just my two cents.
---
I got banned for “hate speech” and “racist meme”  from the wow sub for making a meme about the Shadowlands trailer, because the title was making fun of “we wuz kangs”.
---
AV has neutral npcs. I guess you could farm them for xp.
---
Dunno what to say but you should be easily owning mages with your felhunter out. I don't play warlock so I'm not sure what you're doing wrong, but you're definitely playing badly. The only way you should struggle is if they specifically are prepared to fight you, e.g. shadow reflector trinket.
---
How do this?
---
Literally me to my friends, I even warned them beforehand that classic is a marathon not a sprint, and that not all of the games enjoyment and quality comes from endgame.
---
But after level 40 they started moaning at how bored they were, wishing they could just boost/be boosted to 60.
---
Except you're not working in WoW you're taking part in a community based MMO. Asking questions has been there from the beginning and it's what has brought so many players together and that's part of why so many people have fond memories of vanilla.
---
There's a difference between asking questions and being unable to learn. I'm sorry but hating people for asking questions is just being an anti-social prick and I would reconsider my place in this MMO if I couldn't stand people who just want to exchange information.
---
When I dropped mining I thought somehow I could still smelt ore with my engineering. Not that weird of a brainfart.
---
Hi Chief, good job on hitting 60! I know that took alot and I'm sure you're proud of your achievements! Raiding may seem daunting now,  but in time you will find a group of like-minded champions just like yourself who can defeat the fire lord, Ragnaros, together and be all the merrier for it. Just take your time and it will happen before you know it.
---
Really?  Is that 1 second a proc saves really that valuable?
---
When BGs come out, has Blizzard confirmed that it will be Cross Server queues? 
---
Also, do cross server queues lump PvP, PvE and RP all in together? Or do PvP servers have their own group of servers lumped together, and PvE has their own, and RP their own?

he plays retail right? why is this new?

If you approach a social interaction with me in the manner of "I'm too lazy to search for this myself so I'm going to use this other person over here", why would you expect me to see that in a positive light? Why would I want to start a conversation with someone who merely sees me as a time saver?

I agree with ya, was a hard truth i had to swallow and eventually sell it for so low just to recoup the Ah Deposits i had to eat each time.
---
Pretty critical, especially on PvP servers. People like to say that an epic mount is BIS forever, and they're right, it just makes everything you do so much more convenient.
---
That said if you want the Mechanostrider, keep plugging away at it.
---
Uh noob friendly in lvling sure. The DPS rotation is tied with cat DPS as the most difficult in the game. Not clipping autoshots, pets that can die easily, and to say nothing of melee weaving for optimal DPS. Warlock way more noob friendly.
---
I usually do, especially since I know I might have questions with the lingo. But I guess some people might still not want to be bothered 🤷‍♀️
---
The concept of fun for just running random dungeon goes out the window after my 100th run of a dungeon that I absolutely do not need to do.
---
You should use the time you set aside for meme making for leveling instead.
---
I did lots of quests at 60, got me my epic mount fairly quickly.
---
I'm gonna get downvoted for saying this, but 15k is the sweet spot for me.
---
&gt; Player with 12k players on a WOTLK private server and it was overcrowded. Played with 4k players on a private TBC server and the world felled empty.
---
I think its a bit different for those versions of WoW, because they are centered on one small continent with flying, and a shared capital city.
---
In vanilla people spread out all over the place, so a higher populations just means there will be people around in every zone, which is not a centralized as in TBC/WOTLK.
---
past results have no influence on future drops btw ;)
---
Nice ninja edit on your initial comment ;)
---
Yeah retail nowadays is just a rushfest not unlike what hack'n'slashes have become.
---
To be quite honest I’ve made roughly 9,500 gold with my lionheart crafts.
---
It's fun until both sides have a good deal druid and the bg never ends
---
The germans had a superior army by far
---
Yes, so even the people who for some reason have to visit AH in Darnassus, won't have reasons to visit him.
---
And on top of that, the entrance leading to him is a little hard to find.
---
Or perhaps our opinions don't matter at all. Especially if we're trying to impose them onto others.
---
When queues are that long, people will just camp in BRM with their premade while waiting in queue :)
---
No need to apologize, I can explain. It's an estimate of how many players are actively raiding on each server.
---
These players are likely to be online concurrently during prime time. Thus, while not conclusive it shows that there are far more active players on each server than there were in Vanilla. Especially considering that not all the players active at 60 on each server will be included in warcraftlogs - which is to, these estimations under shoot the actual overpopulation by a good margin.
---
How do people get enough gold for an epic mount and lionsheart? 
---
I play everyday, grind everyday, and im at 800g without an epic mount. Im started to get frustrated with this game.
---
TBH most tanks leveled in BRD and already have all the gear they need from it. Once phase two came out I tanked 350+ brd runs, most were anger/arena but some were full clears. They could be doing literally anything else but they are offering to come tank for you as a service, not because they need gear or XP. You apparently needed a tank pretty bad so he was going to bless you with his presence.
---
It's still an unquestionably better starting point than no research or forethought.
---
Sounds pretty good.  I may try this.
---
It's understandable to a degree. Once they start bending and doing changes there is no telling when they would stop. First it's fixing major bugs, then minor bugs, then things that only annoy people, then it's making QoL changes, and then it's completely changing certain aspects of the game. 
---
I know people hate the whole idea of the "slippery slope" but it's real. You ease people into changes and they start asking for more. It's really convenient for people to forget it but the vast majority of things people complain about in retail were things the player base demanded.
---
Lightforge ain’t bad as it has all the stats you need.

And I went to college expecting to be made CEO of Walmart the year after I graduated. Turns out that life doesn't always work like we expect it to. If you put all your hopes and dreams on assumptions, you're going to be disappointed sometimes. Reroll and be happy playing a game you love, or quit, and don't play a game you love.
---
As a Bigglesworth Alliance, I think this has to do with the fact that we're always fighting at a disadvantage, so we're always put in difficult PVP situations, and regardless of how they turn out, we tend to improve our PVP skills moreso than Horde because Horde have easier times winning PVP currently based on numbers alone. I'm curious when BG's come out and the numbers are forced even whether Alliance will have the upper hand simply because we've been forced through the Phase 2 hyperbolic PVP time chamber.
---
They have mentioned Cross server, but it is unknown if it is across all servers or will stay within the same Battlegroup, like it was before. Battlegroups ensured the same 5-10 servers would only play against each other, meaning you might never play with the Rogue named Stabbz on your server but you'd recognize him in various Battlegrounds.
---
If you want to see what Battlegroups were in days of yore:  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Battlegroup](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Battlegroup)
---
Glad this worked out for you, but it definitely did not for me. I just couldn't keep up with the peasants with downranked flash heal, and oom'd quickly. Downrabk renew + abolish disease spam made it radically more manageable for me.

I was wearing mostly pre-raid bis with one or two good raid pieces at the time.

---
What addon r.shows nameplate by class? I'm mildly colorblind so seeing all red is hard.
---
&gt;You hit a zone with a relatively small group, and as soon as the horde army shows up you retreat to a new zone.
---
This is exactly what my friends and I do. Our server is ~40-60, so it isn't too bad, but the horde on Whitemane has crazy zerg complex - they'll just call/summon 30 people against 3 players for that oh so tasty sweet 2 honor points split. 
---
When we start to see the masses flying overhead on FPs or warlocks summoning more and more people, we just bail and rotate to the next zone.
---
&gt;everyone you dislike is obviously a classic baby

This is the discussion that led me to initially try BS spam for multi-target tanking, and it lines up with what my experiences have been

The true man way

I think you've summed up the majority of the classic population pretty well.  The game will never match vanilla, peoples attitudes have changed to much.  I honestly don't care what they do with classic at this point, I don't miss old games, I miss the old communities that used to form.
---
Eh, they get $45 as the player subs for another 3 months, but the destroyed server leads to 4 others quitting, resulting in a net loss.
---
&gt; Alternatively, I'll just sit in IF spamming my blacksmithing/engineering macros while you look for a tank
---
we would prefer u did that.
---
I played both a druid and a priest in tbc. And druid 2v2 always just felt dirty. Sometimes games would last an entire hour. And I’d sit there like “why the fuck am I even doing this. Oh ya cause im bad but still want shoulders that look like tribal bird beak wings.”
---
There is a private WOTLK server that has 15k players as I am typing this.
---
True, although I am really bad at it hah. I always drop right into these things lol.
---
You got Predator vision!
---
That mount will cosg 10g. 8g w/ rank 3 and honored. Riding training would be 720g, so 728g total.
---
Running with people trying to invent their own specs can be super painful.  You can significantly impact your usefulness if you go too far off the rails in some circumstances.  Some specs demand strict adherence in order to pick up key ability, others have some leeway.  If you just go in blind on talent points you are reasonably likely to end up a fair bit worse off. 
---
You usually get at least a few options.  DPS vs healer or DPS vs tank, SM/ruin vs DS/ruin, deep frost vs arcane frost.  
---
Again, I think most people rolling standard PVP or PVE are going to be more on the min max side.  
---
If its your first time you can take your time enjoying the quest lore and such, but talent experimentation (and gear) is probably best done with some insights if you don't want to end up a burden, and if you do want to move on to a guild/raid and future content.
---
Its on the battle.net account services page.

TC is terrible threat; it’s low damage and forces you out of DStance. Definitely no other ability in the Warrior toolkit compared to BS for initially grabbing multi-target threat.

The only time i have issues with this is when the healer starts healing immediately. Happened last night. I can take a few hits, i am pretty much all raid geared. Helping some lowbies in BRD and the healer would immediately start healing and i would end up having to chase mobs.
---
Move your screen around if the nameplates are stacking. Use Mana pots before you go oom, the CD will end sooner. Use whatever rank holy nova is needed to oneshot the skeletons. Good luck!
---
No, asking for advice on how to improve doesn't necessarily mean you play badly. So it's not clear that asking for advice means someone is aware they are playing badly, since they may not be. It could be the case that (depending on the situation) it's very difficult to do better and you're not doing anything wrong per se.
---
However in this case, you are in fact playing badly.
---
Because there is undeniable proof of the massive population imbalance on most servers.
---
Yes, popular pservers had around 8-10k online so I am not surprised by 15k
---
Warlocks don't really use the imp for damage. At higher levels, the imp is merely a mana source, along with the Dark Pact talent, plus their Blood Pact buff is nice.
---
Golemagg-EU is also ok. Horde outnumbers alliance, but alliance has more HC guilds so wpvp is back and forth depending on the players involved.
---
Had crazy chat delay in Golemagg the past week and a half.
---
They fixed it on sunday though. At least it seems alright now.
---
"Just get a 40 man raid together, with 1/3 of the player pool! Then when word gets around of a large Alliance v Horde pvp battle it surely wont just become massively outnumbered by Horde within 10 minutes because theres literally 3:1 ratio." 
---
Good job joining the faction everyone knew would outnumber the other side massively before the game launched man, everyone is real proud of that big brain decision.

Im a level 60 gnome and still havent bought the epic riding skill nor the epic mount. I wanna buy the Ram from exalted with AV, do I need Exalted with Iron forge to ride it or the mechanostrider training will do ??

For everyone looking: THIS is the kind of player we don't want on PvE realms. This is why Blizzard shouldn't allow transfers. The people that ruined the experience of PvP realms because they like griefing, are just going to come over to PvE realms and grief us. Stay away, and keep your infected corpses on your side of the wall.
---
It sucks that PvP is on all servers. I wish blizzard would add a couple of servers where you could choose to PvP or not. Sucks that we have no choice.
---
He does tho.
---
Exactly. Blizzard caved to these complaints in the past. It’s the reason why we prefer classic. If they want to play on a PvP server where it’s not overpopulated and you won’t get ganked then the retail version is ideally made for those type of players
---
Generally once u have all ur gear from dungeons you only run it to help guildies or friends. 
---
wow requires an insane amount of time investment to get to the endgame, particularly from tanks, if u made it to that point its unlikely u want to run dungeons without loot u can use just so u can break even after repair bills and spend an hour and a half of ur time (which could be spent farming/fishing/grinding honor/leveling an alt)
---
 its fine if ur not ok paying this price to a tank but its also not unreasonable for a geared tank to ask to be compensated for their time helping u clear a dungeon. U wouldnt expect to have some stranger power grind u through low level dungeons without some sort of payment. Its the same thing. U can pay their price or wait for an undetermined amount of time till u can find a tank who actually needs the dungeon.
---
Ok you can believe that. But then you are conceding your original point that "there isn't any overpopulation" as I just demonstrated to you with empirical evidence that there is.
---
Doesn't hurt to have a nice collection for Nef

I think it's 10% of the rep.  So if you normally would get 50 you get 5 if the quest is gray.  Not really worth it.

My server was one of the first to be locked to a single layer, mostly because we didn't hit the threshold for layers.  And guess what?  Searing gorge is a nightmare.  Layers cannot fix a 80/20 balance.  Seeing 4 alliance for every horde is disheartening.  Seeing 10 to 1 when running to BRM is even moreso.

But really, most folks have crafted there item and know just make bags. It may pick up if folks lvl alts but it was bound to slow till just before the next raid that gives to new patterns or that folks reroll to different spec/toons.
---
I'd say most of the time, no.  If you actually ask for help people seem extremely willing.
---
You are just wrong.   
---
THe priest is the class that is limited to cloth for a reason. Because it makes thematic sense. The Paladins and warriors can wear all armor types for similar reasons. Because it makes sense. You chose the class you did and the restrictions on gear that come with it.   
---
Stop trying to reverse that and force paladins and warriors to only wear one armor class.
---
Wow is wow crack.  Fortnite is piss
---
Are you on an actual low pop Classic server? Which one?
---
And I don't blame you. That being said, try rerolling PvE, first. You'll see it's a whole new experience, free from all of the frustrations of being ganked constantly, or having quest mobs and resource nodes being stressful.
---
Two ways of approaching it as a Disc Priest if you're serious about BGing, way I see it.
---
If you're a dwarf priest you can pull off [FCing as Disc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2qaDKqROVs), just prepare to use a lot of consumes and Engy and practice kiting/survival. Spec. If UD slightly more difficult to pull off but still. Any other race might be a bit more difficult cuz Stoneform + Fear Ward + Desperate Prayer is extremely powerful combo for brute forcing through a situation quickly. [My personal spec.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAioofVdhb)
---
If you're going to be more into pocket healing or just mid control healing then you just want to get into a good understand of how to position and stay on the move and work on quick reactions. [Spec is somewhere around this give or take what you want.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsqioofVp0f)
---
You want to stack Stam, Int, MP5, and + S.Dmg/Heal gear. Anything with combos of Stam/Int/+S.Dmg, or Stam/Int/MP5, etc.
---
Stick and move and stay behind your crew unless you need to jump in and fear bomb. Rocket Helm + Scream is a strong group pusher with Rocket Boots going and FAP/LAP, for example. Lots of Lock/Spriest encounters can be hedged around with that second Fear Ward in the pocket, or Stoneform + direction change to zone potato Rogues just enough for a heal, etc. Holy Nova is one of the most powerful spells in the game in the right situations and can single handedly defeat a lot of players by itself. Learn to bait Kicks and Silences before actually going for a heal. Work around Instants most of the time, Flash when you've already baited them to blow it on nothing a moment prior, or work a Nade in for the time you need to Flash Heal + Shield.
---
It's a fun playstyle if you stick with it and get enough HP to avoid stunlocks or caster bursts, which you can if you devote your gear to stam. There comes a point near end of Vanilla where Warrior itemization in particular is really the only thing that will beat PI + Nova with a lot of stam/s.dmg gear. Good luck with it.
---
[Too broke to give you gold, but I made this for you.](https://i.imgur.com/UtWOkyk.png)
---
Except that's not overpopulation at all since overpopulation is related and measured by concurrent online only.
---
So you went to one MC?
---
Lol jk. You’re attitude reminds me of one of my favorite quotes, “you’re not wrong, you’re just an asshole”. Yes, SGC is good for hunters. Should you take it over a Warrior when you may end up replacing it literally any week since release while the Warrior will use it for literal YEARS?
---
Yes, HOJ was your preraid bis before DM, should you take that over a Rogue/Warr? What about Dal Rends?
---
The answer to all three should be a resounding no. Your response essentially was  along the lines of “I don’t give a fuck about some rando”. You are certainly entitled to that opinion, but the beauty of Classic is that reputation matters. People will remember shit like that. Nobody wants to group with the guy that only gives a fuck as long as he gets his. Selfishness will only get you so far, and Hunter’s time in the sun is quickly fading.
---
I dunno man, my husband is our main tank, and he leveled an alt to farm gold bc he considers this toxic. To each their own though :)
---
And this.
---
If the server is 60/40 there would be 600 more hordes online in total, and a portion of those hordes will be honor camping. Just how many is hard to tell.
---
Like lets say there are 400 dedicated hardcore horde campers online (again, no idea what the actual number is)  and you have 2400 alliance in total, you should still have enough manpower to be able to fight back.
---
Its not like 100% of the horde is camping searing gorge, its a lot but its not all, and I am sure alliance can bring up the numbers to counter-act at least somewhat on uneven servers.
---
It’s just seen as disrespectful because you are making a real life analogy about an event where millions of real people lost there lives and likening it to a meaningless video game in the hopes of internet upvotes.  Saying “feels like” belittles the people that actually experienced this time in their lives.  There were ways you could have gone about this without bringing up WW2. Idc that you did, but this is how people perceive things.
---
I've played wow as a night elf hunter main for the past 14 years, and I didn't even know this guy existed lol

Yeah I’m on Earthfury and can’t sell anything on AH... even Mooncloth.

I do max rank GHeal (unless shit hits the fan in any way) in dungeons and I never run out of mana.

I go through water like crazy though, cause I drink all the time.

Proof?
---
A lot of people on Reddit in general like to act like the 'Reddit Police' and it's incredibly annoying.  I've clicked on people's usernames before and literally half of their interactions on Reddit are just telling people their post doesn't belong here, or to Google before posting, read the guidelines before shit-posting, etc.  The irony is that they don't see how their posts commenting about the value of another's 'shit-post' is a shit post in itself!
---
The thing you have to realize (because it seems like you may be one of these people) is that at one point in time you had the EXACT same question as the person you are chastising.  Everything you've ever known was taught to you by someone else or by observing someone else's work.  Your knowledge or process of obtaining knowledge doesn't make you any better than anyone else.  This behavior typically comes along with an ego running rampant with a desire for recognition and approval.
---
At least you have become aware of your behavior, that is the first step to recovery.
---
Regarding mage's polymorph:
---
If I tag a mob and then polymorph it, does that mob still counts as mine or is it back to FFA whoever tags it again?
---
Not always the case.  Think my quest was bugged when I tried to do this for like 3 hours.  Everytime I'd just afk and follow behind him and let him kill everything.  When he encountered the random elite pack on the road towards the tower he'd get killed everytime.  Seemed like he was attacking/swinging much slower some attempts than others that I did, so not sure if that was  bug or what.  But he kept getting killed on the road before reaching the tower, which would fail the quest since he didn't die to the tower mobs so Tirion could come out and finish the rest of the mobs off.

cuz leveing sucks ass in this game....  lol  wtf?
---
honor is based on a ranking system.. the more people compete and the more honor they get, the harder it is to rank. should be about the same effort for the same reward.
---
Don’t be worried, BRD is hella easy
---
People have been pugging MC for months. You could literally farm hunter t1 chest faster than SGC
---
Its because *hurr spellcleave only gaiz* is why there are more mages than rogues.
---
&gt; just want to roll on whatever they can equip
---
What does this mean? Are you suggesting people can roll Need on items they can't actually wear, or is there some other behavior that this refers to?
---
Here is an idea for you.
---
Scrap cross-realm battlegrounds. They were not a part of the vast majority of vanilla (like maybe 6 or less) , and that would punish the naughty horde by giving them aids long BG queues if they are playing on shit servers, and encourage people to create equilibrium on the servers themselves.
---
And if they are in 80% faction and they play extra naughty and make more alliance cry and quit the game, well guess what. The queue gets even longer, maybe that will teach them to be nice.
---
Same thing with priest drops in my guild, Benediction is my 4th raid gear piece since we started raiding in MC. But we have full epic geared druids! :o
---
Anyone know of any buff-checker/announcer either addon or WeakAura? Looking for someone that will announce in /say or /raid if someone doesn't have priest buffs, mage buffs, etc., and say who is missing which buffs (and which group they're in). I definitely remember this being a thing at least in BC, but I can't find anything that does this.
---
You still need rogues in BG’s, in fact they are 100% necessary. They’re job is to open on the healers/casters once the warriors are occupying the attention.
---
Well if you already knew what I said you wouldn’t have commented that.
---
No damage? Very little sure, but it does do damage and is much better snap threat than demo on small packs.

Jaina Vardys, havin a party

If you roll paladin you wont touch your druid EVER again. You can pvp, farm, heal anything and tank 5 mans in the same spec. You keep going like duracell rabbit long after other healers gone OOM. Youre so sturdy and Reckoning so effective melee dps will simply ignore you.
---
Go ahead and have a taste
---
IF all players are in the know, sure. But take players like my little brother for instance. Never played wow before Classic. Luckily, he got to endure 21 months prior to launch of me filling him in on things like this. But not every new player has someone to tell them these things. They can hardly be held responsible, there has to be some leeway. People ought to be given a chance to learn these things. Not every decision made by every player is an informed one.
---
Then reroll Alliance coward.
---
With crossed realm bgs do you think its that long queues?
---
Happened to me too. Its bullshit
---
Can someone who is being camped join a party and have the leader queue them up for bg? It would be nice for non-rogue ally to have a way out besides trying to hearth out
---
They should allow for a 3rd faction that is FFA... Kind of like how ARMA has 2 factions plus the rebels who are on no ones team but the teams they choose to make.
---
2h fury was viable b4 this but with this new discovery(last week i think) slam 2h fury is the best spec for current gear levels. The prio is bt&gt;slam auto &gt; ww &gt; hstrike

"nO cHaNgEs"
---
You're DPS.  They're a Prot Warrior.  You can farm, they can't and mostly resort to either dungeon runs as income or professions.  Try and put yourself in their boots.
---
IMO it takes a ton of binding space to have a macros swapping stance and using ability, and it doesn't do anything you can't do manually. 
---
Personally I have all stance specific abilities bound in their respected stance bar, and all non stance specific bound in the general bars. This way I have one keybind that uses say charge taunt and intercept, all based on what stance I'm in. And one keybind that uses recklessness, shield wall and retailiate etc. So I end up using VERY few keybinds and get full usability, as long as my stance buttons are bound very accessible which they are.
---
It's the Age of Outrage, when you just complain on social media in order to get others to solve your problems for you.

I still can’t believe people don’t realize alt f4 closes programs. I figured that out when I was like 10 (when I started wow and someone did that to me 😂)

Stick with hunter, once youre 60 is one of the least boring classes
---
Shit, I forgot about that. Why did I sell my last 2 bows.
---
following
---
As a vanilla rank 14 Vanilla player who obviously spent the majority of most days PvPing for a very long time.. I gotta admit: the first time I dueled on Classic I had actually completely forgotten you *fmove around** in PvP and don't just stand there hitting each other like fighting an NPC. It's mind blowing the things you can just completely forget over time/with age if you haven't so much as thought about them since.
---
Biggest issue I see with new tanks in BRD is over excitement and wanting to charge in... and then the whole room gets pulled.
---
Pot no, healthstone yes. Let Druid get opener as they have pretty much no hope vs a warlock anyway.
---
It won’t fix balance, but a proper population means you will run into less enemies, even if the imbalance is the same. It’s problematic, but more handleable.
---
Everything in the quests that already has lore attached to them will have canon lore in the quests.
---
The things in the quests that has no lore attached to them has custom lore. Just to give the player a reason to travel around the world and not make it very boring. I kept it very grounded with a few jokes. I did not write it so that thrall now is evil with shadowpowers or things like that.
---
It’s just people don’t have time to explain a 15 year old game. Anyone who has knowledge mostly got it from their own interest and love for the game. Not from me explaining it to them.
---
My guild voted before release on what faction to choose, there wasn't some deep debate about it lol.
---
But great argument dipshit, really shows how all you want to do is complain and cry all day on reddit.
---
The pugs ive played with had all the keys for the runs we have completed, very fortunate for that. I agree that players may over hype brd to an extent. At first i saw on my atlas loot addon there was 26 bosses and saw the map of the place but almost everything connects.
---
Go to a PvE server
---
What? Blizz is changing the game by allowing higher populations.
---
In terms of ally races that anecdotally attack first:  
---
Gnome &gt; Night Elf &gt; Human &gt; Dwarf  
---
the obvious things apply, when they're in a group you're almost always toast (which works both ways of course), but if it's just you and them Gnomes almost always initiate.   
---
I was just minding my own business and a gnome warrior charged me on my Tauren warrior when I was one level up on him, I got him but I was surprised that he even tried.   
---
Another time I was on my mage when I saw a gnome go down to a quarter health fighting a mob. I eyed him up then left him be, as he was peacefully eating. He then promptly attacked me as soon as I tagged another mob. I ran off and lived that time, but any gnomes out there, what's the deal?
---
It’s still going to be camped but maybe 1/6 roadblocks will be in bg.
---
Playing on Faerlina sometimes feels like that picture of Iron Man vs Batman, where they are tossing money at each other. And below them both on the ground is us, Spiderman, trying to pick up a few dollars here and there.
---
Imagine not googling something first in 2019. What a boomer.
---
Hi! Just got to 20 on my warrior alt and wanted to do some reading up some in depth warrior tanking as I level to learn about stances and dancing etc. I have basic grasps of it, but I'd love to read more to know what to expect as I level up. 
---
The warrior discord I found seemed to be mostly chat based. Wowhead and Icy Veins are pretty generalized, even though they've got a lot of good info. Anyone have any good places for me to go?
---
"You can't say that 20AP to a hunter is not justified but is justified for warriors taking leather from rogues or casters fighting over items."
---
What? Yes I can. 
---
HoJ's main feature is it's proc that only works on melee swings. Its very clearly a melee only item. You want 20 AP for one phase, that is just pure selfish.  There is no leather equivalent that is somehow inherently better for rogues or hunters than it is for warriors, but warriors would still want it. The leather gear that warriors want is literally just truestrike shoulders and devilsaur which is crafted. That is all. And there is nothing even close to truestrike for plate. Its not like we are out here taking every single leather piece. I wouldnt take Bracers of the Eclipse even if it was an upgrade for me. Noone tells hunter they can only have mail shoulders, why do you think warriors should only wear plate ones?
---
However, there is barbarous blade in DMT that is a very good stat stick 2 hand for hunters. Warriors would also be jerks for taking that from hunters, even if it was an upgrade. And they don't take it. They understand its not an item for them, despite it being a melee weapon. 
---
I get your "BiS is BiS" argument. But when its a 2% proc for melee only, and a measly 20 AP that literally doesnt matter at all, you can use your brain and realise you should just wait for Dire Maul. Or form your own group to get HoJ without warriors if you are that obsessed with 20 AP.
---
Like I said, keep making excuses coward. "Muh guild picked the higher population faction" just sounds like youre a bitch to me.
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/
---
Actually.....it is against ToS when you do it on a PvP server.
---
Look up a lvling guide for ur class, most of them mention high impact pieces to watch out for
---
Especially since based on your website the active playerbase of popular classic server is way less than active playerbase of popular vanilla server back then
---
His brother was also 5 time grand marshal don't doubt!
---
If you look at our fourms you'll notice people are pretty pissed off because then PWW went and griefed horde guilds that went after the boss.
---
(Horde go the boss anyway - alliance didn't get it)
---
Prestige world wide is the least reputable guild on Kromcrush.
---
&gt;	Shut up? Why the hostility? You seem upset that vanilla itemization isn't how you think it should be.
---
Because the comment about the game not for me is condesending. 
---
&gt;I play a priest and 100% encourage holy pallies to roll on cloth gear and win rolls over me. It's just as good on them as it is on me.
---
I play i shammy and i would pass cloth for a clothie. So we have a different idea of how things should be.
---
If it’s dueling for practice then you are trying to get something out of it.  Stealthers will open up on you sometimes, but the stealthers also need practice getting on targets that know they are around.  So if you are trying to practice do both, let them open sometimes and then do ones where you will pop them out of combat.
---
The same question comes up with warriors and them getting a charge off or not.
---
If you are just outside the city and they request an unsolicited duel, f’em up.
---
Oh, my bad.
---
Yeah looks like I'm the real fool. I forgot that I actually wanted to be camped, I enjoyed it and I did it on purpose. I also don't know how to count numbers, so I thought it was an hour, but it was actually only five minutes. Doh doy duh doh I'm so dumb and wow you are correct. Your description of what happened is the correct one, that is, to reiterate, I deliberately wanted to be camped and that is why it took an hour.
---
Tanking just isn't fun for most people.
---
I tried tanking for awhile cause it's the fastest way to get into dungeons and get gear...  Not fun...
---
The lack of any reliable aoe aggro generation is just murder because a rogue or fury warrior will already easily rip aggro from any similarly geared tank if they actually dps.  A rogue pops blade flurry and a mage aoes?  You just lost aggro on everything.
---
And the best part is that you can't EVER get aggro back on anything without using taunt.
---
Blizzard directly changed the experience by allowing much higher populations and then removing layers you moron.
---
ACHILLES!
---
I see this is already been compressed and reposted in the first 24 hours of its existence
---
This, but as a warlock, dont use any cds or healthstone in 90% of duels cuz u win without it
---
I am literally a researcher in real life, so when I play a game I might want to immerse and relax. And yes I still google a lot. But I don't like to approach games like I approach real life.
---
Leave me alone, troll
---
Tanking pugs is cancerous, dpsing pugs is not.
---
The best way to duel is to duel with a priest in front of camped FP so you tilt those who camp this FP prematurely.
---
I am not forcing anyone to wear anything. I just think its respectfull to pass for others. Doesnt make me wrong or you right.
---
lol why such a dick mate
---
This is the one that I use\^\^
---
If your names red youre dead.
---
Step 1 - Leave the guild with alt
---
Step 2 - Write in guildchat "A friend just noticed you can kick Any1 from The guild by typing ./gquit &lt;Name&gt;
---
Step 3 - Watch and enjoy the dummies in the guild begging to get reinvited 😂
---
On the contrary, cross realm BGs might make the queues for horde short enough where they won't have to pvp out in the world that often. And if the open world is no longer closed for alliance like it seems to be currently on many servers, it would probably encourage alliance to play more again.
---
Question: Does it just scale with +Heals or does it scale with +SP as well? 
---
Think it would be fun as a spell hunter, who would have mobility (arcane shot and serpent sting spam) while having good sustain. 
---
If its only +Heals, Holy Pally OP.
---
Not hating just pointing out a quirk.
---
you can try [gnosis](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gnosis)
---
&gt;which was not even a thing in the vast majority of vanilla
---
Should they also removed the current talent trees for half the classes and remove spellpower?
---
Things in vanilla were changed, and it's been largely established that classic would be based on 1.12, not some arbitrary bits from previous versions as you see fit to whine about.
---
Which is why the NOCHANGES crowd can go enjoy the gold found in the tracks of Kodos.
---
Balance changes occurred for two reasons in vanilla wow.  Something was mechanically broken, i.e. rogue vanish.  Or something was broken by the players, i.e. reckoning bombs (pre capped levels).
---
Due to the way players use their classes and have sought to min/max to the umpteenth degree, it creates environments that are decidedly unbalanced or not in line with the goals of the developers.  I doubt it was intended for warriors to scale so well with gear.  The lack of itemization supports this and then when we have proper gear in AQ+, warriors become gods of the battlefield.  Or we have raids with as many warriors it can support, over 25%.
---
The nochanges mantra suggests the game was perfect in 1.12.  That everything was balanced, that everything was fair.  When we can clearly see where the benefits and detriments are.
---
This applies to the class breakdown but also to the Horde vs Alliance split.  If you rolled horde for WOTF or dwarf for fear ward, you know exactly what I mean.  The intent of these racials was to provide some flavor for the players.  Not to be pushed towards the min/max of pvp races and pve races.
---
Looking over the history of retail wow, you can see that Blizzard understood the imbalance of 1.12 and tried to even the field for everyone.  TBC had much better paladin, shaman, and boomkin dps.  It gave a taunt to paladins, it gave spell breaks to rogues, and scaling to hunter pets.  It wasn't perfect but no MMO in existence was.
---
If we continue to push for NOCHANGES we are only going to continue down the path of Horde overpopulation in PvP servers due to the power of racials.  We will only see the demand for warrior dps at the exclusion of all other classes.  We will see the game warp to the boundaries instead of being able to play evenly.
---
I'm not a game developer but the NOCHANGES mantra is going to strangle Classic.
---
Just be careful and look up the items, some of them have not been released yet.
---
I'm not sure, I don't play on one. Hey /u/whistlingyew do they give coffee refills at this place?
---
You know this works both ways tho right?   And if you are outnumbered by horde that means there's going to be that many more eyes popping out against you preventing you from AOE cleaving down the enemy that outnumbers you.
---
Big brain.
---
Darnassus seems like kinda a waste to me. I wouldve preferred that the gnomes had a capital city instead. Darnassus is just so out of the way.
---
For background there are two alliance guilds on my server which are well organized and camp all high level pve content pretty much all throughout the day. Even though alliance is slightly outnumbered. 
---
In practice this means you can expect to die at least 1-2 times on the way to any high level instance. Some (like DM) at times 5-6 times if multiple groups camp the paths there.
---
Hopefully things will calm down more in p3.
---
It’s an easy way to refresh an old brand without thinking of something new that works.
---
Imagine me reading this, being first with stronghold gauntlets plans on my dead plebean server, having made 500 g total since, and farming for sulfuras solo...
---
Both heals and spell power for + healing, damage only scales with + spell power or + damage
---
Thats the first thing i ask when getting through the portal is what quests/bosses do ppl need. Ill run the place a million times but i wanna make sure the players in my group have a good time with the dun while they are with me. Oh man thats unfortunate about the Windsor ordeal there. I looked up jailbreak run on yt before tanking for that since thats a popular run ppl wanna do.
---
Imma charging ma fireball
---
Layering isn't to blame. Project Budget is.
---
The whole reason Layering was even created was because WoW Classic has a fixed project budget and Activision-corporate didn't want to spend a bunch of money on a project they couldn't monetize (ie Cash Shop). So, Blizzard devs worked with what they had. Make enough servers with out having enough servers.
---
Now, why they turned it off and not, say, reduce it the aggressiveness of layer creation, is beyond me.
---
*Maybe they did it to cause the problem so they'd have an excuse to rush out more content ahead of schedule. BGs aren't suppose to be 'til Phase 3, of* ***six phases****; not even the end of the year and we've got content from the 'half way mark' coming out. - All in an effort to get Classic "done with" before Shadowlands comes out, figuring most of us will transition back into Retail. Once we've run out of things \[content\] to do.*
---
That’s wild. I got my flurry axe for 275
---
Yeah, have fun doing the Silithus content when that comes out if the servers aren't balanced by then.
---
BRM is nothing in comparison, and you can just hide inside the instances.
---
The biggest issue seems to be they abandoned the idea of having vanilla caps. The layers were capped at vanilla server levels, but when they removed layering they appear to be allowing many more than the original number of players to log in at once. If they had kept the original cap (2500-3k) when layering was removed many of these problems would be solved or at least less of an issue. But they would have queues a mile long on the overpopulated servers and more people would have to transfer.
---
I have no idea what your point is. I described the strategy shown in the video. Anyone who gets a mage to 60 can do the exact same thing. If you target someone with a low HP pool, you don't need crits or follow up to get a kill.
---
The spell used was pyroblast. Since we know that the person could not have successfully cast a 3s cast without being interrupted, that means that PoM was used as well. PoM is above AP in the arcane tree, so we can safely assume that the mage has that talent too.
---
I know that on my server people are doing this on both factions in multiple capitals.
---
You're good! But to answer your edited question, no you don't need to get exalted with anyone but AV to ride/buy it. I was a troll in vanilla and was not exalted with org and I had one.
---
I was told only horde are low enough to camp FPs. Have I been lied to?
---
Reroll on a PvE realm, or quit.
---
Just tried this out. The yeti does not attack alliance and has to be spawned very closely to the NPC. It will immidiatly go to the NPC to scare them. :/
---
Have you to give someone a DK.
---
I’m going to ask a real dumb question....how do “thinks” make sure they don’t level to let’s just say 20?
---
Lol I guess it's time to learn how to script and we'll make I r own
---
You are responding to a post where I described how voluntary discord surveys (our only source of data) can and will be biased in the direction of under-reporting the horde overpopulation. This is textbook data analysis and the opposite of an anecdote. 
---
More importantly, are you going to tell me that horde does not outnumber alliance? Is that what your thesis is here? That is what you are saying I'm wrong about? You're having a good laugh about how actually the alliance outnumbers the horde and we keep losing at pvp just because we are bat at it? Is that the discussion we are having? You having a giggle mate?
---
When the answer to the exam question is “All the above”
---
I mean i replaced a crudton of my gear while leveling from tailoring... That +spell power was amazing! Plus I was able to craft awesome gear for my other friends leveling like frost mage and junk! They were so danm happy and it made me happy too.
---
OP - I suggest checking out this thread. There are a ton of responses where people are agreeing with you and I'm seeing a lot of comments talking about willful ignorance, people wanting to be spoon-fed, etc. So I think you and I are in the majority on this.
---

Such a pessimistic attitude. You dont know collusion till someone has your faction /who you and then they corpse camp you haha this is just a solid display of a strong gaming community
---
Dunno what your tanks are doing but we usually have duo jump runs and the profit is split.
---
Lol you must be a horde player.
---
&gt;Should they also removed the current talent trees for half the classes and remove spellpower?

Yes, I would have 100% preferred that.

I thought it was spicy diarrhea
---
Yeah I know thats whats popular. I'm hoping someone will come along and show me them crushing as dual wield in open world pvp since a 2H is just not my style of gameplay.
---
wow! that was incredibly helpful, appreciate it!
---
Calm down elitists. We are playing a game not doing a work assignment. One shouldn't have to study a game to play it
---
nice vid but your guild gave corehound tooth to a druid
---
Oh I didn't say they weren't. They have uses.
---
I raid as 2h Fury, and plan to do so for some time. But I would only be doing this on Horde, its much much stronger on horde due to WF and rend head World Buff. I enjoy the pace much more than 1h, but will definitely switch to 1h later on. For raids the most important thing is Flurry uptime, I usually have around 70% Flurry uptime in my MC runs, + Rend head haste. Both arms and fury are good for AOE grinding for different reasons, but id use a 2h if you are trying to farm mobs as Fury. I'm not sure if you're horde or ally, but I wouldn't even try to make 2h work on Alliance, Horde enables it to be a very strong spec.
---
For the very first example / sentence, yes obviously you should know that. That is obvious no matter the game.
---
THAT BEING SAID, yeah the rest is a fair point.
---
Awesome! Thanks my man
---
All these people commenting on over-population, and here I am on Bloodsail feeling like I see less and less logging in each week :(
---
Not all of us want to spend hours of our first experience in WoW reading guides. Like others have said it's not about the information it's about the interaction. 
---
I'm guessing classic is your second go around at Vanilla WoW? Back when you played there wasn't just less information but less communication methods as well. I'm sure if Discord existed in 2004 everyone would have been on it but regardless the lack of Discord and many other tools is what made WoW so special for everyone originally. It's why it felt like a world and not a game. 
---
I've noticed many of the people coming back to Classic aren't trying to re experience Vanilla they're trying to perfect it. You guys do whatever you want but stop acting like everyone is in the same boat as you. Seriously, stop for one second and consider the types of people playing WoW.
---
If it makes you feel any better. We needed a raid group to fully protect our Guildies completing it lol.
---
haha i’m a developer by trade so familiar with scripting but not worked with anything related to wow, could be a super fun project tbh
---
The insanely high demand for Arcane Crystals is deflating the price of the Thorium, as it's just a byproduct of that farm.
---
I rolled paladin after getting forced into 1v10 fights trying to lvl up to 60 on my priest.  Got my new pally to lvl 32 currently since 2-3 weeks after phase 2 dropped.  Can't wait to at least fight back with him and still be able to raid heal for gear.
---
I should have done it sooner and I wish more guides were more accurate on which classes were more durable for newer players that were guided to roll on PVP servers.  IMHO, i'd say SL warlock, holy/rec paladin, druid, Ice mage are the most useful classes in the phase 2 pvp servers for alliance players, mostly because they are durable/flexible while able to hold their own in pvp.  Most of the population rolled warrior/priest/marksman raid hunter/pve spec'd mage on my server and I suspect those are the ones complaining since I think they are terrible if caught solo.
---
Fully agree on that one. On Pyrewood Village EU it's virtually impossible to do anything in the open world at any decent times. Not because of deathballs (PvE server) but because there are so many people that anything with a gold/hour above Scarlet Monastery is permanently farmed.
---
Maybe, but he always was kind of like this. I remember in his old Cata videos he could never differentiate between classes. Like he would see a mage casting frostbolt and be like "Kill the warlock!", when it was plain as day there was no lock.
---
It's been 2g per stack of 10 ore for roughly forever on my server.
---
Yeah. I'm the healing officer/priest lead. My overall raid healing is quite high so I prefer to let the others gear up, but I have exactly _one_ piece of t1 and only Monday got the t2 hat. Feels bad man.
---
Druids are waaaaay better at survivability than locks in 1v1 situations, if they don't want to die they will not.  Locks are better at actually fighting and winning most of their 1v1s though.
---
Definitely easier to obtain that's for sure
---
Is the downvotes from your server or the guild lol
---
Good answer.
---
I'd say in large pulls it situationally could be worth it for initial aggro (i.e. if all the mobs are non-elites and will be killed quickly, or if there are 1-2 elites in a big pull, you can grab all mobs initially before tab sundering the elites). I don't even have Thunder Clap keybound. It costs too much rage and does a negligible amount of threat (less than BS). For 2-4 mobs, if you can pull off a 2H charge+SS+WW combo opener (then switch to def stance), then I'm pretty sure that is superior to BS as well.
---
If they were just about saving costs, they wouldn’t have invested in making the layering tech.
---
Any consumables your class can't make themselves, IMO.
---
Healthstone - Yes  
---
Mana Ruby - Yes  
---
Health pot - No  
---
Engineering stuff - I'd usually say no, also. 
---
Any cooldowns over 10 minutes tend to be frowned upon in my experience, too.
---
If you aren't ready for BWL in a few months when it drops its not like BRM dungeons, MC, and Ony are disabled.
---
there's literally a gnome mage on herod who does this all day in org 
---
I guess now I'm allowed to cry when I get killed and get upvotes  here hell ya
---
The alliance on your server jumped like rats fleeing a sinking ship back with the free transfers.  BGs should make it quite a bit better.  I would say sweat it out until BGs come out and see how it feels after that.  It’s less than a week away.
---
Im a mothafuckin star boy!
---
How did you farm gold on your warrior? Or did you have another main feeding him gold?
---
Again many people on the dominant side also don't like it because (a) they totally understand that it's not healthy for the game to have such a poor state of PvP and roaming areas for 10min for the lonely ally that will die in 1.4sec isn't fun and (b) because even when you are on the dominant side, you get ganked by group of allies targeting people playing alone on server where it's more like 60-40. 
---
Like I said I'm playing horde on a horde dominant level and (anecdotic evidence I know) my guildmates, people I group with while leveling or general chat are far from enjoying it. That's why your whole theory doesn't work: you are persuaded that only people dominated aren't having fun when it's just not true.
---
So... your view makes sense but in my opinion it's based on a totally wrong hypothesis and therefore I can't say anything else that you haven't convinced me at all that this sub doesn't give a good idea that this phases is really not popular.
---
&gt;Want to join the 90% faction on a server? Well, no fucking BGs for you.
---
Vast majority of people joined realms early, almost no one wants to be on the 90% faction
---
We'll see eventually if Blizzard is gonna take any action towards the issue other than offering free transfers. Currently they don't seem to take any stance, even if it was just to hint that they are aware.
---
And while your idea is noble, I'm not entirely sold on it working as well as you think it would. Players on the dominant faction might still rather play on their current server if the numbers aren't awfully skewed, instead of coordinating with their friends/guild to transfer off to another.
---
Retail is single player
---
As a troll warrior with thrash blade, what enchant is more threat in 5 man dungeons or for onyxia?  Lifestealing or crusader or one that I am not thinking of at the moment?
---
You acted as a rogue should.
---
No it isn't "just respectful" to pass for others. You have this assumption that there is some other plate piece I could get that would be close to as good. In reality, it won't even be 50% as good as the BiS items I need from another armor tier. You just don't get it.  
---
Just because you rolled priest, doesn't mean you get priority on the best cloth gear that the pally also needs. It just makes no sense at all. The first, second and third best things could all be cloth and you think you just get to scoop them all because you chose a class that was armor-limited.   
---
What is respectful is understanding that people need the same gear as you, and expecting to roll on them against that gear. Not expecting them to pass their best gear to you and use far worse gear just because of the class you chose.
---
Man, this is definitely not my experience on Kromcrush. Constantly hunted and immediately ganked. Even when i feel like I’m the middle of nowhere leveling up my gathering professions.
---
Good to know there’s actually some nice/fun players on the opposite faction.
---
Rerolled a druid over to a warlock, is 35 to low to play with a 45? my friends have been kind to wait for me but they just finished STV while I'm about to start it. but i need SM gear about now and they think it'll hurt more then help to take me through a few times.
---
Not every server is horde dominated.  Also, alliance on horde dominated servers don’t have a problem camping when they can too.
---
&gt; This is genuinely the worst moderated sub I'm subscribed to. 
---
You should subsribe to nottheonion, they put these guys in second place quicker than a horde mage takes down a shit talking gnome.
---
Too bad that has nothing to do with what’s being discussed and doesn’t even address the issue
---
I see that too. Occasionally ill lfg as a dps to take a break as a tank and i feel that some tanks just get nervous they are going too slow for the group then decide to mass pull. Some areas you can in brd with non elites. I try to keep it simple and LOS pull when i can. Of coarse i like charging in more to generate that rage but its not worth the risk ever to wipe.
---
Sixtyupgrades
---
100% speculation here but yes. There is no magical backup Alliance force like those ghost pirate warriors in lord of the rings coming to even the odds. Most PVP servers are horde favored, at like  5:4 or 3:2. The offensive ones are like 5:1. Of course this is all based off of the janky half stats we have access to. So even with crossrealm BG's, you'd still end up with horde favored BG pools. 
---
But we'll all find out in a week, won't we?
---
It would be awfully confusing if words had the opposite meaning as their greek/latin roots. Since English is awesome, this definitely never happens ;)
---
A port to darnassus is the quickest way for alliance to get to felwood, winterspring and azshara no?
---
Crusader probably, heals you for 100~ and gives you 100str, procs very often
---
Will check it out!
---
Of yeah for sure
---
Okay well I don't think people shouldn't be allowed to ask any questions or that there should be an expectation that everyone knows how the game works
---
Punish people for picking a server on release when there was NO DATA available?
---
So what I see is 2 guilds with different factions collude together and use a 1v1 to decide on who to get the world boss... nice blizzard plz research and see if this is true and ban them.
---
The westfall tunic from the quest is better. 1 run at level 17-18.
---
Wiping a 55 dungeon dungeon at lvl 60 cause your 57 hunter doesn't understand how to dismiss pet is FUN.  LET THE CASUAL PLAY BRO.
---
So glad I decided to roll PvE
---
&gt;then people will actually have an incentive to balance the servers.
---
It's a fair point. It would be one of the only incentives in the game to switch faction or transfer... and it wont exist.
---
you shouldn't have to break ToS to have a 'strong gaming community'
---
5% hit in pvp
---
unlearn it and get herbalism, sell swifthistle
---
Enchanting rods on the AH regularly is the only thing that brings me money in consistently
---
Question on Princess Moira in BRD - If I haven't completed the chain, I can't get any loot from her? But other members in my party can if they have? Can it be master-looted to me? I'm going to do the quest, just curious.
---
2h charge combo is definitely the optimal opener I think but I honestly havent done it in a long time.
---
Sound like a great tank. The wow community needs many more like you my friend.
---
It's either him or the Auctioneer in booty bay that i didn't know existed.  Tucked away in one of the houses on the bottom level.
---
Lok'tar ogar alliance scum.
---
Here's some more food for thought: It's 10x easier and faster to google something than to track down and question another player about it. If someone is asking you for directions/information they are more likely stupid than lazy. Or they just want to interact with another player in a multiplayer game. Don't be so quick to judge next time.
---
Stop acting like there haven’t been changes. There have, and this situation is a direct result of those changes. You are literally mocking no changes when no changes would’ve solved the thing you’re bitching about.
---
You can choose what phase it's in.
---
But didn't all the servers that you could transfer to almost instantly turn into faction servers?
---
And yes, Blizzard has fucked up tremendously, and still seems to be doing nothing and have no plans to do anything about it.
---
But as I see it, if you play on a faction server there should be a downside to it, otherwise all servers might as well be labeled "PvE" and just scrap PvP servers altogether.
---
They all have estimates based on the combat log so they’re pretty similar but not exactly the same. Personally I use KuoNameplates and Classic Treat Meter (I rely on the nameplates 99% of the time) but what you have is perfectly fine too.
---
You need to do the chain and free her and only after that you get loot from the kills.
---
https://youtu.be/9wvvLtsnLpc
---
It's very easy to want a change which punishes people instead of trying to fix the actual problem.  No, let's not try to fix the underlying problem which is the honor system, let's just fuck with other shit and make the game worse for more people overall.  This is a great plan.
---
The thing is we have no choice but to wait and see on that front, theres no way of testing it.
---
I don't think I ever saw a priest of any kind survive a wf+stormstrike+ES in vanilla, so...pretty squishy.
---
Why not make the first tile dranassus?
---
no it was same old same old but you also threw the solution in as well /shrug
---
Ironforge.pro
---
Before the “but it’s not 100% accurate” comments, we have nothing 100% accurate, but this is the closest we have, and it’s better than any anecdotes.
---
F'ing love that meme &lt;3.
---
&gt;See to me this just feels like laziness and disrespect. 
---
I mean no offense but to me that just seems quite egotistical of you. Nobody is forcing people to answer these questions. If you don't want to participate in the social interaction of answering his question there's nothing wrong with that, but I think it's incredibly self-centred of you to imply that there's something wrong (lazy and disrespectful) of him asking questions.
---
I looked into it.... you’re right and it’s very simple to setup. I just wish there was a range indicator, but overall it’s very straight forward
---
Lol for real.  Like any of us give a fuck that he gives 200 honor instead of 250.   O well, guess they'll just have to kill him all 4 times to squeeze as much out as we can.
---
PVP Server player:  "I dont care about pvp AT ALL, in fact, I'm going to try and make pvp as unappealing as possible by hurting my own progress while negligibly affecting the people who already shit all over me.  THAT WILL SHOW THEM"
---
im a night elf.  if i see a red player alone and theyre within a few levels from me, ill try it.
---
I was 1v1ing horde 60s in plaguelands at level 57.  
---
the problem is the horde on my server are like locusts.  where there is one, there are usually more, and they swarm you.  gotta make sure they are really alone before initiating, otherwise you're just handing them free honor.
---
story time:
---
saw a 60 prot warr (had some MC gear, and T2 helm) standing at chromie in WPL.  thought he was afk, so figured 'hey, free honor!'.  i opened with ravage and he immediately reacted.  what ensued was a long fight between two tanks (probably 5 minutes at least of us just running around in chromie's room duking it out).  me a 58 feral tank, and him with his major advantage in gear and level.  I was about to win, when a 55 shaman came in and saved his bacon with a heal, and they duo'ed me down.
---
saw the shaman later and killed him 3 times to teach him a lesson.
---
saw the warrior later and killed him, too.
---
not much of a point to the story, but thats my best world pvp experience so far.
---
This is the way.
---
Probably wasn't you, but I'm not sure if the guy who downvoted me understands why I said nice collection for Nef.
---
The dragon literally breaks your weapon. Hunters need to carry other at least viable weapons to do anything in the fight.
---
Do's and Don't of Dueling!
---
Do : Win
---
Don't : Lose
---
Do whatever you must to win and if the other guy doesn't like then he can be sad he didn't do it first.
---
“In a while” means the last one hour since it’s been reposted?
---
Given some of the shithead Alliance guilds that are on Pagle, I can promise you it will never get old to them.
---
Get fucked alliance scum!
---
Drunk isn't even the word for it. The thing is doin some straight wizard magic. Flying through solid mountains and buildings. Wut.
---
ya
---
Are there not already drawbacks? i.e. AQ gates, more competition for PvP rank, more competition for nodes/farming etc... The only hope the minority faction has right now is faster/more efficient queue times, which the cross-realm system provides.
---
There is downside to playing on a majority realm, you struggle to find PvP, and when you do find PvP, It's a 40 Man Alliance raid because they are bored of dying
---
So as a Solo/Trio player, It's horrible, you either dont find any Alliance or you are 3v40
---
Right, change the rules and punish a majority of players on every server for Blizzard's own inability to balance servers.
---
Makes sense.
---
How is it stupid that a 1.12-based incarnation of WoW would use the era-accurate BG queuing rules?
---
Longer queues for underdog factions was the reason for cross-server BGs 15 years ago, not "dead servers", and that reason is just as valid today and the very reason why your idea is so stupid.
---
It's so stupid you should have figured how stupid it was while you were typing your post and closed your browser window instead of submitting it...
---
Gnomeregan wants to have a word with you
---
So your logic is that your weapon feels slow, so you respec so that fights take even longer? Huh?
---
As a horde i could not quest in hillsbrad without being ganked by 10 alliance members before honor came out so...
---
I tried to keep turning your camera and it felt really funny not to be able to.
---
I input my character info, including level, and one of the items it recommended was Raptor Hide Tunic at 31, even though it's a quest reward from STV that people do in their late 30s early 40s. Classicdb says you can start it at 28 but I'm not sure if that's correct...
---
Probably going to be picking up the game agin, havent played since cata on retail. How are resto sham? They do fine in pve?
---
That’s not a reasonable guild. Reasonable guilds let any caster that wants it spend the DKP they earned on it, with the caveat that it’s better for DPS.
---
Better get on with it. Start with banning EVERYONE on server wide discords. That's a good start right?
---
I don't blame the players, but I do want to punish them and shake them until a bunch decides to reroll.
---
Like how else are you suppose to tackle the faction imbalance at this point? There has to be an incentive.
---
Pots : no
---
Healthstone/mana ruby : yes
---
Bandages : yes
---
Other classes buffs/scrolls : no
---
Any profession related gear is sonething "normal" to me.
---
As a priest I usually pop my shield 5sec before the duel.
---
I let warriors charge me.
---
I let rogues/droods open the fight and I stand still waiting.
---
I legit only used rockbiter, staff bash, earth shock, searing totem. Get a good staff. Ez game
---
When you’re unfamiliar with a topic, sometimes you’re not sure what to ask beyond “basic fact”-type questions.
---
Protip: Just get Bartendar addon.
---
It's too late you won't make anything until you max it and farm arcane crystals
---
Take a second to imagine the conversation when someone at Blizz suggests punishing the majority of players in response to something which caused a ton of people to unsubscribe.
---
Then why don't you stick to retail?!
---
And this comment sums up why I get annoyed with people.... I'm fine with u playing how u want to play but if I'm forced to spend 20 minutes corpse running because you don't learn from your mistakes or can't be bothered to look up "how to be decent hunter". Then ur the asshole.
---
If your new. State it. A hunter rolling on SGC over a warrior isn't "fun" a druid/hunter taking HOJ over a rogue/warrior isn't "fun". People spend weeks of their time trying to get that- having a basic understanding of how the game is isn't hard.
---
The whole group should get teleported to the battle master once the BG ends though, correct?
---
They'll go for each expansion, all the way up to the 'last expansion before Retail'. Why? Because they aren't going to develop two games of the same type. Especially if one of those branches can't be monetized.
---
Then they might add 'pick your expansion' servers.
---
.....with the caveat that these servers will reset every year; all characters wiped or at least reset to 'lvl 1' (to prevent name stealing). But for a low fee you can pay to transfer a character to the 'next expansion' to save your progress; with an 'standard server transfer fee' to transfer from 'last expansion before Retail' to 'Retail'.
---
Lvl 60 bear. Been playing since vanilla and have never been there. Rough at first with mob density and learning which to kill first/cc. Smooth after that.
---
My guild Exiled on The Venture Co. did something similar back in the day. It was us and a guild named The Grim Covenant fighting over the Black Temple summoning stone. We each decided to send out a "champion" from each guild. They sent out their warrior/GM and we sent out one of our PvPer mages. We won and they backed off until we were done summoning. Always fun times with them.
---
For video content Skarm Tank has a lot of very in-depth videos for warrior tanking. He was one of the tanks on the 1hr 8min naxx run and has a lot of experience with tanking.
---
I actually wound up leaving Westfall entirely before grabbing the Tunic, never thought to finish it up. Sure enough like 12 levels later I was able to craft a chest item that was a big upgrade anyways, so I couldn't be bothered to go back for it.
---
We tried this quest as a group of 3, but got hit by roving gank squads of 5-8. Then we got 10 guildies to help out, but as soon as you get a decent sized group of Ally players to leave Ironforge, it's like an alarm goes out and every Horde in a 3000 yard radius comes to get a piece of that honor.
---
Wrong subreddit
---
Lol what does this have to do with classic?
---
Yo mods, I got a legit thread you can redact.
---
Ok cool, hope you feel better.
---
Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat.
---
Lvl 35 here, please find me
---
Sure but the SP isn't determined in a vacuum so everything is relevant.  Basically the difference between 4% chance to save one second and 5% extra shadow damage is 150sp...  That seems excessive, but that's just my feelycraft.  I'll certainly look into it more later...
---
Named your overpower button "op"
---
I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
I'm talking about those who do both.  And had to choose between trinkets.  As a druid I got bis tanking trinkets but now am lacking dps trinket because I made a choice.
---
Hand of Edward the odd sells for between 300 to 500g on my server. 
---
Random fact: Did you know when it procs you can use your hearthstone to instantly hearth.
---
thx homie!
---
Because no one knows it exists .
---
Well, the thing about Nef is that you can remove your weapon before he breaks it. It might still make sense to bring spares but it's not necessary for them to be epic.
---
Also, as I said, Blastershot and Strikers are both worse than Carapace spine. Given that they're beaten by a pre raid blue I can see why people downvote the idea of people giving them to hunters over warrior and rogues. That's like a (admittedly less extreme) version of giving a mage blade to a rogue that doesn't have dal rends set yet so it's an upgrade for him. Like, that might be true but that doesn't make it better suited to a rogue over a caster.
---
I read somewhere that Gomeregan was supposed to be it's own city, but blizzard didnt want the Alliance to have more capital cities than the Horde.  So they made it a dungeon instead. 
---
Wouldve been sick though.
---
Horde have a 60% majority on mograine tho.
---
It is. Why would he have an empty (but hot-keyed) slot on his side actionbars, when they're otherwise packed full. And right below engineering too.
---
The dilemma as a tank is that the better your gear gets the less you actually want to tank shit.
---
The repair bills get very high, so tanks need incentive. No one wants to pay gold upfront to the tank so you let them have the greens and call it even.
---
Yeah I’m ashamed to say I did this a few times will waiting for him to respawn. I repent my sins, alliance.
---
People will still need to run MC and Ony and all the endgame dungeons when you get there so it's all good. WPvP will hopefully die down next week when Battlegrounds are released.
---
More people AND more gold. I think the established gold farming trends for mages aoe farming should have been heavily nerfed right at the start.
---
That second comment I'd incredibly stupid. Some of are stuck being unable to xfer off.
---
Note: It's probably posted because there is a Classic version.
---
If you use a potion in a duel that's just pathetic though and starts to lean on the side of pay to win. Duels aren't about spending gold.
---
 [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;realm=4731\_Earthfury](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;realm=4731_Earthfury)  shows 60:40 A:H ratio for the last 7 days and 53:47 A:H for the last 14 days. So there IS more Alliance playing on this server.
---
The economy IS real bad. I come from Sulfuras where I'd put my stuff on AH before going to bed and woke up the next morning with 80-100% of my stuff sold. On Earthfury, the only things I've successfully sold on AH were the crystals from Un'Goro. I've sold more in AH fees than I've made so far on this server.
---
I'm not saying the server is bad, I'm actually enjoying more than Sulfuras (less ganking ;)), but, from what I experienced, the economy is real bad.
---
For PvP ranks, you are correct (for those aiming for rank 14). But for nodes and general resources, the majority of those resources will circulate in the horde economy, and less will be in the alliance economy.
---
&gt;efficient queue times, which the cross-realm system provides.
---
That might be true, but it does absolutely nothing to balance the faction ratios.
---
And its funny that you mentioned AQ, as Silithus will be completely unplayable for alliance/minority faction if the ratios are too skewed, and that zone is the center of two major patches.
---
BRM will be a joke in comparison, imagine trying to kill the 40 man windstone bosses on a 30/70 server, it would be a joke.
---
Horde only transfers off already exist on a handful of servers.  On the one I play on, it's not really helping
---
Nah it's cause the Classic community is still bad. Not Retail bad but still bad enough to silence curious players. Problem is people aren't playing for the community they're playing for the numbers. The only reason Classic doesn't look like Retail is because of the years of stripped QOL features are slowing people down enough that they're FORCED to interact.
---
In a community like this you will always be stressed when asking another player for help. Not because you're afraid of how they might react but because you know you are wasting their time. If 90% of the player-base is trying to save as much time as possible and get to 60 ASAP then the obvious assumption most people will make before they ask for help is "I'm wasting their time"
---
It's not wrong to expect some research be done prior to asking, but sometimes it's not worth it when a possibly better, more informative or detailed answer can be given by a player already available in-game. Plus sometimes people offer to help! 
---
For example last night there was a level 19 Rogue asking Org general chat how to get to Thunderbluff. Pretty simple question with simple answers. Run thru the Barrens or get a mage port. But if he looked this up he'd possibly find a guide saying take the zep from org to tb which doesn't exist in Classic. Or a guide giving explicit directions when walking from Org, but doesn't say a thing about mage portals as an option.
---
Now when people start asking super broad questions like "what are the best weapons for my class" then I think it becomes ok to expect or suggest looking at a guide.
---
I mean alliance still has more. Thunder bluff barely exists except for quest returns.

Get a Druid to afk in bear with thorns near the mouth of the cave. The Druid won’t be able to see any of the quest mobs, but the mobs will aggro the Druid and die to thorns.
---
Based on classic logs rogues have the 3rd most parses. With mages being #1 and warriors #2. So I highly doubt that rogues are the least played class lol.
---
But it's also dependent on what players want to do.  You have reconcile what players want with what they think they want.
---
How do you balance the factions better?  Cap the imbalance earlier and open other servers?  You would end up with a lot more servers and most of them would have a similar 60-40 horde favored imbalance, only the servers would be less populated.
---
"Less populated servers are better" is what people say.  Except people seem to want to be on the megaservers.  When given the chance they often transfer TO bigger servers.  Fewer people leave bigger servers and go to smaller servers, and quite often those who do leave claim they regret it.
---
People don't want to be on smaller servers because if there is a population dip, which there has been only not as massive as some predicted, then you are left with more "dead" servers.  Those population dips aren't uniform so some would be affected more than others, but you are putting more servers in the danger zone.
---
I was on a low pop sever in vanilla and by the time BWL came out we had about 5 MC guilds on alliance and about 3 on Horde.  I am on a low pop classic server and we have about 6-7 MC guilds and about 3 horde guilds.  Despite what people say about the servers being so much more massive, the issue isn't there on smaller servers.  By capping servers at a lower level, which is what would happen in order to keep the imbalances at a level people deem acceptable, you are making more server in the danger territory.  Any drop in playerbase just results in dead servers.  You get servers were the economy is considered "trash" and people bitch because they can't pug MC at 1am on a weeknight.
---
So the question is this?  What should they have done?  The underlying problem with the faction imbalance is people simply want to play horde more on pvp servers.  Do you change Horde/Alliance racials?  Then all the #nochanges people bitch.  People are going to bitch either way. The biggest problem they actually did was release the vanilla honor system at all, and when they did BGs should have never been separate.  Beyond those two issues, there isn't anything they could do which wouldn't simply result in people bitching as fervently about something else.
---
&gt;Longer queues for over-represented factions was the reason for cross-server BGs 15 years ago
---
Isn't that exactly what I have been saying all long? lol.
---
As in giving incentive to balance the servers?
---
I have seen that orc twice. In the zillions of runs i have done in BRD. Even as Prot, its my BIS for high threat set of gear.
---
As an alliance player on earthfury this is just a recent thing. A lot of transfers in the recent weeks really tipped the balance of alliance over the horde. It kinda sucks tbh.
---
So far this is the only quest to really piss me off and I did it during phase 1. Can’t imagine phase 2. Everyone in my guild who doesn’t have it is just using other necklaces until they get Ony Head.
---
elaborate troll thread or just a noob hunter who ninja’d savage glad, doesn’t know how to look up guides and wants to justify his lack of effort

I think you meant to reply to the comment before mine?

Nintendoswitch gets my vote. Instead of banning me they added my name to a filter so my posts are automatically removed.

Ignored all mod mails asking why

Mod posted a comment saying he reads all mod mail and comments about bans seriously. I message him personally, no response. I'm essentially banned without any ban.
---
Duels are about winning.
---
Maybe it's because I quit a few weeks after original phase 4, but I spent tons of time in AV and never even got Revered. I remember getting angry /w because I would be collecting corpses and farming mines. Was something changed? Is this just private server/TBC/WOTLK experience?
---
Is that confirmed ? And I mean, you are wrong there if you think classic can’t be monetized , there maybe won’t be any wow tokens and other bullshit which I guess is big part in their wallet but they can definitely sell expansions, and if wow classic keeps growing like it is , it will be even more profitable to focus on classic , I literally hope retail dies in a fire lol, rip demon hunters and shit. Otherwise , I hope they make retail similar to classic , hard, engaging , where you don’t level so fast you out level the zone and quests your doing making them completely useless , I mean there is a lot they can change but that would save retail. Classic could be an experiment to see what they can try to save wow
---
Depends on your queue times, which we have no way of knowing
---
&gt;Retail where they will rip you a new one if you dare to ask how to do a dungeon, and rip you another one when you make a mistake, or if you're going too slow 
---
That doesn't seem very casual friendly to me tbh. Maybe I just have thin skin, but I don't see many easier ways to turn casuals away than having a toxic community.
---
That said the only WoW I played before Classic was BC and Wrath so what do I know.
---
If you give him zero assistance outside the gates he will die to the patrol. You have to help him at least a little once you are going down the mountain. At the tower you can resume afking.
---
Source: I failed twice trying to afk once outside the gates. Easy completion after fighting his target when the patrol comes along.
---
No, they're about practice....there is literally no reward you dumbass.
---
It's also probably 10x faster to watch a youtube video about changing my brake pads, but it still helps to have my former car-mechanic cousin help me through the process.
---
That would be unreasonable.  DKP systems should still prioritize loot by role.  You wouldn't let a shadow priest roll on mageblade for example, even if he had the most dkp.
---
That neck is a caster DPS item, it doesn't get replaced until aq40/naxx (at least for warlocks, unsure if mages have a frost/fire better alternative before then).  Healers get a pretty close neck from ramstein and get a better drop in ZG than choker.  From that perspective alone its dps prio.
---
Then again most reasonable guilds with an eye on the longterm don't run DKP to begin with.
---
Healers arent the ones I often have initial (or ever) threat issues. The only time it can happen is if they top you off at the start of a pull or if they pre-load a HoT on you (which is a nice idea, but terrible for the initial pull).
---
Which is not pointless at all. I agree that many of these posts don't get the complexity of some of these problems, but part of the consumer / company dynamic is making it clear what we as a customer base care and want prioritized. I absolutely loathe sharding and layering but also understand from a technical standpoint why it's such an attractive solution &amp; difficult problem doesn't make it any less loathable for me. If this concern is outcried enough then Blizzard will / should make it more of a priority in their design schemes.
---
Chances are at 31 you are still wearing gear from Deadmines, so no.
---
Unless if druids can jumped by multiple rogues outside of bear form. Big ouch.
---
In your server of Stalaag doesnt even run Ironforge or Gadgetzan anymore because horde camp it 24/7.
---
i want classic MoP. thats what im thinking.
---
"And what about the plate that is slightly lower in stats, say 20AP, than some leather? Should the warrior take the plate that is clearly meant for them? Or are they going to dogpile the leather because "BIS!!!!""
---
This item doesn't exist. This doesn't happen ever. There isn't a case of warriors taking a leather piece that is BiS, and a plate alternative only being 20 AP less. That does not exist.
---
The rest of your post is just drivel. Its not like pads of the dread wolf have "2% chance for rogues to attack twice on it". So the comparison to HoJ is still not really the same. It is also not BiS for either class so I would just say whoever gets the most out of the upgrade should roll on it. There are much better boots for both rogues and warriors out there man. Pads arent BiS for anyone at all. So it doesn't really matter who rolls. But I would NEVER roll on Swiftwalker boots, which are the rogue BiS.
---
"Only completely selfish loot whore players would steal leather from rogues right now. After all, better gear is coming in Phase 3. So why concern yourself with a measly 20AP? A good hunter knows that increasing his damage helps the group."
---
1. If it is 20 AP for both people wanting the item, its different than it being 20 AP for one person, and 20 AP AND a chance to proc an extra attack for the other. False equivalence. 
---
2. Hunters get a better item from a quest that literally takes 0 effort, not rare epics from raid. Another false equivalence. By that argument, hunters and rogues  replace most of their prebis with tier gear in MC already, so they don't need any gear at all right? 
---
3. There is no case where a leather BiS piece is only 20 AP better than a plate alternative.  So this really does NOT happen in practice. If there was such a case, you COULD make a case for warriors using the slightly worse plate equivalent. 
---
You trying to use my own arguments against me just demonstrates the problem. You buffoons getting upset about loot have no idea what loot even exists in this game. You just assume there is some plate out there I could use instead and that automatically makes me a jerk. Literally 0 players on private servers got upset about this. Because they were way more informed than all these noobie classic players who came from retail where rogues get all the leather loot to themselves.
---
And yes, a healer shouldn't steal BiS mage loot if its not BiS for them. Its not the mages fault you are still wearing garbage greens. You are only in garbage greens because you have barely done any 60 dungeons yet. You will likely replace that piece in less than a week just by doing some more dungeons.  You dont need to sit in a corner and pray, the gear is really not that hard to obtain at all. You are being way overdramatic about it. 
---
But, in the end, I dont group with green wearing players because they tend to be bad/misinformed if they are still this far behind this late into the game. If I do decide to be nice and carry them, Ill tell them what gear I need. Agreeing on loot before the instance is the best way to prevent problems.  However, everyone knows at this point which leather items a warrior needs and that is sort of just the meta. They aren't going to remind you every time you do UBRS that warriors need the leather shoulders too. You should just know that. If you get upset about that, thats because you are just ignorant.
---
You think warriors are entitled. We don't replace most of our prebis gear for many, many phases. Hunters and rogues get FULL tier sets in MC, replaced again in BWL. Warriors get 1 rare bracer, 1 rare glove, 0 chest upgrade til AQ, 0 leg upgrade til AQ, 0 shoulder upgrade til BWL, 0 helm upgrade til AQ, one extremely rare belt off ragnaros. We top the meters in our blue gear when you are in full purples, but we are entitled for wanting the FEW pieces of gear that are actually good for us. Bullshit.
---
What about the ones in Gadgetzan? I didn't know about those guys until someone told me about guys who use them to transfer gold cross-faction on PvE servers.
---
Is that confirmed? I didnt think you could get outright banned without a GM review.
---
Most people running a dungeon are there for some quest or specific piece of gear. The monetary value of loot is minor compared to those objectives. 
---
So if you want a tank who needs no gear or quests from a dungeon, only offering him 1/5th of the monetery loot value, while you are standing to gain something far more valuable in the form of a gear upgrade, is pretty insulting to the tank. Basically you're expecting them to help gear you up and get a pittance in return. 
---
If tanks are actually needing gear from someplace they generally don't ask for payment.
---
In terms of pvp, what is the most brain dead class to play? I think I heard shamans are just auto attackers but don’t know how true that is. Shadow priests seem pretty easy too. Just looking to level an alt mainly pvp focused. Already have a hunter atm
---
Ya the weapon swapping is just practice. And yes all the defensive talents lie in the top of the prot tree. I was referring to things like wearing minitationgear over threat gear and knowing a good balance between the two for each fight for ur context.
---
&gt; removing spell power
---
Because there's no spell power in retail...
---
&gt; using pre 1.12.1 talent trees
---
Because we knew Classic was going to be based on 1.12. If you would prefer something different, then maybe Classic isn't for you. 
---
Retail has no talent trees, maybe that's something you'd like more, if you like 1.7 trees better than 1.12...
---
The trick is to have ADHD and constantly move anyway as a nervous tic!
---
Definitely not staged, I actually had to log into retail to see what server I was on.  Also, I'm happy this post led to a few players from that long ago reaching out.  Over a decade ago and we can still catch up like it was yesterday.
---
No pots, I always let the rogue/druid open. But when rogues uses vanish then ill try to aoe them out
---
You do that to break line of sight and because it's way cooler than just standing in one spot exploding over and over
---
Then why do you care so much if we want transfers. I’ll gladly pay blizzard a couple of bucks so you guys can continue to gank each other and I get to play somewhere else.
---
End results going to be the same for you anyway.
---
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Enter.png
---
They need to figure out how to minimize that. And I’ll love any game that accomplished that.
---
Fair enough, and framing as an incentive to balance the servers would be better received although I expect nothing to be done.  Earlier BGs are Blizzs answer, gonna have to see how much it makes a difference in the world (of Warcraft)
---
What he's saying is that rogues wont be able to compete in solo honor farm, when battlegrounds are released because people are gonna be farming so much honor in battlegrounds.
---
How do you make people who are lvl 60 with 30 days /played reroll then?
---
There is no incentive for them to do so, and there is no downside of playing on a 100% faction server. Even if they added faction transfers, why would anyone use it? 
---
I don't see any way for Blizz to solve the mess they caused without bringing out the whip, and don't forget that the lower pop faction on the servers are being punished right now, just as the the majority would be if they implemented server wide battlegrounds.
---
Had this happen with a unique trinket in Azshara. I looted one and then about 20 minutes later another one dropped. I intended to sell it, so luckily there was a guild mate near who ran to me so I could trade it to him. I just had him mail it to me.
---
I think if you keep this attitude you'll do fine as a first timer.  It only takes minimal effort to understand your class/role anyway.  Read a guide for like 45 minutes, use it as occasional reference, and you can alt-tab to a BIS list or type your dungeon shopping list out in notepad and alt-tab to it.  Minimal "extra" effort for a game that takes a couple hundred hours to reach endgame content for a moderate play through.
---
If you are good at managing your rage then its very easy to charge in each pack. Even los pulling you can back up enough to intercept the pack and begin a rotation again. I do it all the time in end game dungeons. It stuns 1 target so i immediately tab over to a next. I feel it helps the healer out in giving him/her an extra second to wait and let me generate threat on the pack as a whole before needing to heal.
---
Dude he knows... hence the “imagine”.
---
Number of raid logs doesn't mean shit. 40 man raid is mostly dps and you have 3 real dps options. Them being 3rd tells me they're the lowest of the main dps. Right now warlocks are support and spriests aren't good. Wait till Naxx comes out and mages drop off the numbers and replaced by locks and Spriests come into play. Rogues also have poor scaling so they tend to drop massively each passing raid as their damage barely increases. Warriors do because it's weapon damage based attacks. But Hunters and Rogue damage are all mostly static based damage. Which means outside of white hits nothing scales with gear.
---
I rolled horde because I played Undead in Warcraft 3. I really don't understand why your faction matters this much. So much animosity against a player who chose a different character than you... I just don't get it.
---
Main reason why I was looking for play tips is because I am aware of the gear upgrade options:  
---
HOJ: I've done 60+ Arena/Agers. Haven't even seen it drop yet... super shit luck
---
Lionheart: Shit takes time and money, which I've got little of either. Currently have 3 Arcane Crystals so got a ways to go there
---
Brigams is obvious but you gotta get the drop ;)
---
Warmasters vs Eldritch I guess I woudn't have considered
---
And you said it on Might gloves.. just need to get them.
---
I'm Undead btw. I'd like to try farm a compendium for Quel Serrar though.
---
I don't have logs. I'm not worried about our other tanks I'm just trying to have fun while trying something different.
---
How much more gold would I get from solo DM North tribute runs if I Disenchanted the loot instead of vendoring it?
---
I know it's server specific, but I'm only looking for ballpark estimates. I currently have Mining/Engineering at 300, but I don't think Mining is very useful when I can just farm DM North and buy bars.
---
Blissful PvE, probably the most diverse healer in Vanilla. Ankh is beautiful.
---
I was thinking vael too (if he can break guilds he can certainly break PUGs), does anyone know just how much DPS is needed to down him? I read 1M someplace but that seems way too low, slightly below getting Rag pre-submerge but with unlimited mana/energy/rage. Though with a lot of damage given up for FR, so…maybe?
---
I expected a 100% recreation of the experience I had with PVP servers from Vanilla WOW onward.
---
I played on a mega server in Vanilla. I play on a mega server today.
---
The two are not the same at all and my server has a pretty reasonable faction balance.
---
Yes cool forced faction balance.  How do you deal with the fact that pvp servers are almost all 60/40 for the horde?  Even at 55/45 horde, that means every single server that gets opened is like that.  It also means that you have to spread the populations very wide and makes the servers vulnerable to the dread DEAD SERVER everyone hates.
---
There already has been an exodus from classic.  Some of the smallest servers, usually language specific ones, are already having problems.  What happens if there is another wave in a month or two?  How many servers would be considered "unplayable" in the name of faction balance?  You are simply shifting what people bitch about from faction balance to dead servers.
---
As an Enhancer, I use iron grenades as a way to get in melee range since everyone starts 30m away :(
---
??
---
He's 47?  When's the first trinket?? somewhere around there no?
---
As a PvE player I totally agree, not sure how the PvP folks feel about that.
---
Proof of anything, just a bunch of people in here sputing over visual bias consensus and not any actual data.
---
&gt;slam
---
when i use slam, my swing timer, resets my Weapon swing, so it seems that i cant cast Slam between swings.. Is this the case or is that an addon bug ?
---
Reasonable guilds don’t tell their members they can’t spend DKP on an upgrade.
---
DPS doesn’t get to reserve an item because there is a healing-only version that’s almost as good. That neck is BiS for every caster right now,
---
Do you know why twinks are getting life stealing over crusader if crusader is a better enchant?
---
Playing a mage is the equivalent of easy mode in classic.
---
felt like this was ragnaros
---
The people who say "google it" or post this horrible reddit thread are actually intending to signal that they are smart. They want other readers to see them say "google it noob." They will not whisper that message to the new user directly, they want to display to everyone the fact that they know this information, and that their time is too important to waste on a non-knowledgeable untermensch.
---
Rogue vs mages is supposed to be a pretty even matchup, if both have all cooldowns.
---
You don't need to have conversation with someone to have a meaningful interaction with them. Asking another player for help on something is way enjoyable to me than alt-tabbing and googling "Quest guide for X" then spending 5 minutes reading a quest guide then tabbing back and forth while comparing the in game map to an online pdf for 10 minutes.
---
Same for answering player questions. To me, even sending just a single sentence response to another player is way more fun than doing a kill quest of watching stat numbers go up. Of course, that's probably because I play WoW for the community and player interaction, not for stats and gear.
---
Spriests are a toss up, and warlocks as well as long as they're not SL and the mage has their cooldowns.
---
It’s okay I kept killing a priest who would run from the graveyard to get the buff, then I killed him as he was running past me. So now he has to spirit walk to his body then run all the way back to the graveyard to reapply the buff only to die again.
---
40-60 on a 5k pop server translates to 1k MORE horde than alliance.
---
You're welcome to my guild, dm if you want an active raiding/leveling guild on Stalagg. Alliance on this server are few, but stubborn and proud.
---
You stack as much spelldmg as you can without going oom during fights. Just bring mana pots and dark runes/demonic runes if you go oom.
---
5% is pvp hit cap. I would shoot for that. Can't be missing stuns.
---
3 days it took you. irrelevant.
---
&gt; The vendor trick could be tough depending on where you are
---
This is why you always carry a repair bot ;)
---
Haha I was just kidding man. I'm sure you made a boat load of gold though
---
Its funny you mention chromatic boots because boots of the shadowflame are actually our BiS . but since they are leather, we pass them to rogues. We do the same with band of accuria. Its actually the perfect example of warriors taking a worse plate piece than a leather one.
---
put up dots and fear them
---
you seem like a blast at parties, you bring that girl home for the first time, youre fucking it up prematurely as always she turns around goes "eugh, google it. sex has been around for years get your head in the game"
---
But you made it. Thats an achievement imo. You conquered your rage and won. Good job.
---
I did the same thing to an undead priest except he never got to the end of the quest, he just gave up and went somewhere else or logged off.
---
Wow.. So mature.
---
Is it worth it to drop skinning for enchanting as a mage? I feel like I'd make way more gold by disenchanting since my server doesn't really have an active devilsaur leather market anymore, and enchanting would be arguably more useful anyway.  I do know enchanting is a heavy initial money sink. At what level does it start to pay off by disenchanting greens and blues?
---
You're not entitled to have someone tank for you. That's what he's talking about. A lot of tanks have gotten the gear they need, have solid guilds, and aren't looking to run pug dungeons with a bunch of randoms. 
---
Tanks can generally pick and choose what group content they want to participate in, so they choose the content that provides them value in some way. That's not entitlement- it's just reasonable behavior.
---
Sheild
---
For sfk and sm it's nice for bigger and safer pools. 
---
For zf it's nice for a safety. Not needed. I did most of my leveling with a shaman healer. 
---
For prison it's not a concern but people think Nova helps. Best xp is 5 mages if people aren't dumb and any healer can pretty easily do the healing if they are. Nova doesn't do a meaningful amount of damage. I prefer shaman for Mana totems for quicker resets.
---
Took me about an hour to get into BRD last night as a lvl 60, almost full raid geared prot warrior. Last saturday, it took me 23 deaths from flight point, to the front door of BRD. An hour is a pretty decent metric on my server.
---
Ooh nooo! I just got ganked for 2 hours, I’m going to get an xfer to a pve server until I feel rdy to come back again!
---
Allowing free xfers will kill all but 4 servers. That’s how it is in retail. You only have like 6 servers that have any reliable way of doing hard endgame context due to everyone playing their.
---
Not allowing xfers means that people will have to look if quitting is worth it. Your stuck on this realm. And many players will quit and come back later, or won’t quit at all because they don’t want to lose that investment.
---
It’s how blizzard made you play wow instead of other mmos. That investment should deter others from quitting. Because a mass exodus is bad for any server regardless on how it is achieved.
---
If you want to reply to this I want all of my points to be addressed or I want no reply at all.
---
It's not too difficult to search the auction house for Large Brilliant Shard and assess from there. If you're using an auction add-on that tells you the value of your drops, even easier. On Kirtonos-H, LBS is about 2g25s per, so any drop under that value is worth DEing for the mats. Non-weapon greens under about 4g50s have the chance to become Greater Eternal and this are better off being DE'd as well.
---
Literally free kill.. i wish you the best of luck sir.
---
Btw you sound like a twat rn
---
I don't know the actual number, but I remember he has a 3 minute timer and if you don't kill him by then he enrages and it's virtually impossible. 
---
He also buffs the entire raid with something that gives them consistently full rage/energy/mana, so it kinda becomes a game of pumping out as much DPS as possible without pulling aggro, because if you do pull aggro there's a strong chance you'll wipe your raid.
---
Experiences are important, but if what everyone is saying is correct, then a max ranked battle shout is more efficient per expenditure of rage than tab sundering.
---
You mentioned that you had problems holding threat with people AOE'ing, which is something tab sunder/revenge handles fairly well.
---
Something doesn't seem to be adding up in the mechanics of it.  If Battle Shout causes 55 threat per person affected, and applies to every mob, then a max "hit" battle shout would cause 275 threat per mob, for 10 rage spent.  Which would mean on three mobs for a full rage bar, you could generate:  2750 X 3 8250 threat versus sunder armor, which at max rank causes 250 to a single target, which would generate 2500 threat split across however many targets you tab through to apply it.
---
The only time battle shout would lose out over sunder armor is if it affects 4 players or less, AND you're at single target.
---
You're not the boss of me now
---
Good eye! I never noticed that
---
Shut up nerd
---
It’s not about honor you stupid fuck. We have a good time ruining your time. Understand now you mouth breather?
---
Without a doubt Mirah's Song, unless you're rocking Aged Core Leather Gloves.
---
There is no excuse for being ignorant when you could be learned instead.
---
I just tank. Haven't played any other role in Classic wow yet... and I have two 60s a pally and a warrior, both tanks. (Yes I'm strange)
---
When you're new to a dungeon, just line of sight pull everything, and I mean everything. Those neatly packed groups make life so much easier for aoe and tab sunders.
---
Another big tip, always be the one to initiate agro, as it helps it stick to you (assuming you're a warrior) 
---
The threshold to pull agro is roughly 120-130% of the current agro holders level. So when you initiate the pull with a line of sight, it allows a wee bit more of an agro cushion while you get into rotation.
---
Feel free to PM me OP if you got questions about the upcoming dungeons. Cheers, keep killing it
---
Everything is wrong with it. Not everyone has a mage to abuse farming mechanics. Priests farming Maraudon to this problem to a lesser extent as well. DM North solo farm is also a problem and should have been corrected. All of these things would have been fixed in Vanilla if they had been the problem they are now. They actively corrected potential inflation issues from such farming methods frequently back then to prevent the type of problems we are seeing. The rest of us are stuck suffering the consequences of their laziness.
---
Doesn't matter that they weren't introduced until later. Most of us came back to play with certain people. Going to a different server without those people would make it pointless to play the game. Can't convince them to move? Then you are stuck.
---
75% of people are playing World of Warcraft for more than just an outdated RPG and enjoy interacting with other players in a massively multiplayer game. 
---
More efficient doesn't always equal better. Isn't that why people switched to Classic in the first place?
---
Chat shit get banged
---
Hmm i have no idea why they'd do that
---
Everything I've heard is that enchanting is not very profitable, lots of people are giving away enchants for free with mats
---
So you’re basing all your knowledge off of streamers complaining????  Seems like half this sub
---
Yes, you are right actually.
---
I would let the current servers die, so Blizzard could have another try and do it right this time. I would rather have a few good servers than a bunch of really shit ones.
---
And I think a lot of servers are dying anyways, or turning into faction servers (anything worse than 40/60 is a PvE server in my eyes).
---
Line of sight pull everything there, super dense and lots of casters with fears. 
---
If you charge groups, one bad fear is a wipe.
---
Why even play a game if you're just gonna look up a guide and connect the dots?
---
Do you have an opinion on the matter?
---
Or are you just a cross faction cheating bitch yourself as well, so you come in here with attacks and yet no real input?
---
It's not 2005 anymore. 
---
This line of thought is so perplexing to me. People are clearly perceiving it as too fast. Saying it wasn't too fast fifteen years ago has no bearing on if it's too fast to us today.
---
Vanilla didn't have it in the beginning, IF was the only one at first. But they got added later in some patch
---
&gt; How do you make people who are lvl 60 with 30 days /played reroll then?
---
You don't.
---
&gt; there is no downside of playing on a 100% faction server. 
---
wPvP is non-existent as fuck on a 100% faction server. I'd consider that a downside.
---
&gt; Even if they added faction transfers, why would anyone use it?
---
What has that got to do with anything?
---
&gt; I don't see any way for Blizz to solve the mess they caused without bringing out the whip,
---
...so you want them to make an even bigger mess, punishing even more players and making the game even more unplayable for more people and call that a solution?!
---
&gt; and don't forget that the lower pop faction on the servers are being punished right now, just as the the majority would be if they implemented server wide battlegrounds.
---
How are they being punished? They had more than enough time to reroll before P2 if they felt like the game was punishing them for playing on the server they play on. Who wants to level a new toon from scratch, on a new server now, now that wPvP is out?
---
Parry and Tactical mastery are very strong. I won't deny this. But I've seen Minimal difference as far as parry goes since i've switched. Tactical Mastery I miss much more, but in MC. I also get your mocking blow comment, but I can count the times on my hand where i've needed to mocking blow in a pinch and it honestly was a luxury would've been fine without it.
---
I'm working on hit cap:  
---
Gear like Bracers/Brigams Belt from UBRS just haven't seen them yet,
---
Lionheart takes a while and up until a week ago. I was a prot warrior. On my server making money using tank service is about as efficient as just farming SM and cashing in on the vendor.
---
I didn't have any problems with Prot warrior rotation, it just simply didn't generate enough threat is slow burn fights like Ony when you have to constantly yell when someone is creeping too much threat.
---
well heres an angle i havnt read yet.
---
I Do my best to not google when it comes to WoW, i consider it "cheating myself", id rather ask in game to see if anyone local knows the answer, you know kinda how it was back then, research was word of mouth and books rather than google.
---
You’re like a fisherman who fished so much there are no fish left, and you are blaming the fish.
---
The problem is that you’ve got two randomly moving objects in space. So every time two players run into each other, the server has to not only calculate their position, but their collision, and how that collision affects their position. Do the just stop dead from a head-on collision, or do they deflect from an oblique collision?
---
Now add a third player beside one of them. Does the collision of the first two players deflect one of them into the new player? That adds a whole new set of collision and position calculations.
---
And all three of these players are running, jumping, strafing, and mouseturning like you typically see in most PvP scenarios. That’s already a significant server load.
---
Now multiply that by two hundred. That’s what a raid on BRM at primetime looks like.
---
Dueling heavily favors certain classes, like mages and hunters since it's an open field with no LoS and no circumstances for doing stuff you can't get away with in wPvP like sheeping someone and sitting to eat 3 times.  I generally don't even duel people unless we're both trying to learn something.
---
Furry chat addon to go along with my BTTV emote addon?  Aaaaw yeah, the future is now.
---
It's not really shitty either way. Same server BGs, like you want, will make extremely slow queues for horde forcing them to stay out in the world PvPing. Cross faction will keep them moving in and out of BGs and out of the world allowing you to play the game.
---
I don’t regret doing pvp serve but I wasn’t expecting to add 30 minutes of time to every BRM instance to account for corpse waking there.
---
When I played in vanilla as Horde on an imbalanced server, cross-realm BG's dramatically improved my experience in pre-made BGs. It was the difference between going against the same insanely geared/coordinated teams over and over again to actually having a shot against pre-mades from other realms. It also took people out of the world pvp environment because they were sitting in IF/SW chain queueing for BGs, whereas before they were waiting 20+ minutes to get into AV. It definitely had an impact as I recall - it was one of the better moves Blizzard made at the time.   
---
The AQ gate events I'm referring to require both factions to open the gates. If you're playing on a horribly imbalanced server, you're going to have a rough time getting the gates open to begin with. That's one of the "punishments" I'm suggesting. World bosses are only being killed by a handful of guilds on every server as it is - there aren't many guilds with 30+ online ready to go at anytime these days.
---
If you have the time you should honestly just go ham on STV for like a full day and then grind through a few levels in Cath with your own group.  You will probably catch up to them or at least come close.
---
me orc me hav no brain
---
I think i might go find a guild that'll give me eye if it drops
---
Your assuming I fish. And using that to discredit what im sayings your wrong on so many lvs and no amount of upvotes is going to change that.
---
Do you have a better metric for measuring this, or are you just going to act like it?
---
rogues with spelldamage ?
---
How does this comp deal with the sheep? Hunter / priest obviously they can dispel but hunter / sham or druid would be difficult, no?
---
Why do some Gifs like this look so smooth while others not so much?
---
Lol I’m not assuming you fish. I’m using a metaphor.
---
In what world do rogues have bad scaling lol. 
---
Also based on the  data availabe and my own experience rogues are very popular. You still haven't given me any evidence that they are "least played class"
---
Pretty sure they removed right click reporting
---
Nobody assumes either of those things. But it’s also obvious the horde tend to lean towards pvp while alliance lean toward pve. So now you have the overpopulated faction that also is more likely to pvp.
---
And it doesn’t apply because I don’t do what you tried to infer upon to me.
---
very true
---
Step 1: be a mage
---
Step 2: go to Blue Recluse
---
Step 3: make water for everyone that comes in
---
Be the change you want to see.
---
I know, but how many of those people are PvP campers?
---
Lets just put a random number and say that horde has 600 dedicated campers, then alliance would still have a pool of 2400 to match up against it.
---
And again, its not ideal. I don't like it, but I think its still a chance at that ratio.
---
at 30/70, there will be 4k more hordes than alliance, and there is just no point playing there.
---
All the Goblin Auctioneers are linked. I always knew there was one in Booty bay, but i didn't know there were others throughout the town.
---
I think we just disagree on whats more powerful because you described exactly why germany was more powerful
---
Lol
---
&gt;But here you go I took top 10 post for last week and you find this one with 96% upvotes
---
A person complains about being outnumbered 1 vs 5-6. See? 5-6 players like the activity, 1 doesn't, who is the minority here?
---
Author of your first example also said:
---
&gt;Well I once had a horde run past me without killing me.
---
Whoops, an alliance on pvp servers? Very likely a literal minority. 
---
And he complains about balance on his server being NOT in his favor. 
---
&gt;Oh and Mograinne WAS balanced but since P2 most alliance straight up quit. Horde holds every FP, instance + 50.
---
You still somehow use upvotes as a measuring statistics when it's the whole point of vocal minority of unite. They are unable to do anything in game so they come here and upvote each other. As I said before, people who are okay with the current situation, go and play the game, people who are unhappy, go and complain on reddit. That's exactly the negativity bias I have mentioned.
---
&gt;The community is sympathetic to this cause as shown by the staggering ratio of upvotes
---
Yes, because they don't actually care aside from poor poor alliance guy who got farmed again. You cannot play poor thing? Here have my upvote.
---
Being unhappy with the game because of p2 = unsubbing. And trust me, Blizzard were well aware a lot of people aren't actually for classic and their rose-tinted glasses won't last for long so they will leave.
---
I'm currently using Auctioneer, but it hasn't seemed very accurate for me lately. It looks like it saved the market price from when I first installed it and is comparing everything to that now. Probably bad configuration.
---
I could always compare manually, but I figured that asking is much less work.
---
I never got the chance to run it in classic until now. Of course in retail it always pop up in the dungeon level grind! Had to explain that you clear to the elemental boss on the platform and the group didnt listen and pulled the whole platform after aggroing a reaver!
---
I seem to have missed the part where you offered any helpful advice of any kind
---
Does this still work anymore? Is it against terms of use?
---
I think i understand your point now, but if you plan on raid tanking...you should never select Blackhand's Breadth over Mark of Tyranny.  Literally ever.  MoT is the best trinket you can possibly get as a bear tank.  
---
Mark of the Chosen is not an acceptable substitute and therefore if you choose BB over MoT, you've made a mistake.
---
To be clear...I'm talking about endgame raid tanking...you can certainly tank 5-mans without MoT, no problem.
---
So you’re denying thousands of 60s both alliance and horde will play bgs upon release, or?  How do you measure common sense?
---
I really enjoy ClassicThreatMeter, too. Especially the recoloring of the Blizzard name plates. One feature of ThreatPlates that's really handy though is that it shows your stuff like Rend on the nameplate. Is there an addon that does that for the Blizzard nameplates as well?
---
Raid gear isn't the best PVP gear but it's decent since it usually has lots of stats
---
I saw someone the other week hosting a community event where this was the "reward" for winning rofl
---
hey i'm just some dumb forum n00b can you read this for me plz i can't comprehend something this complex
---
https://imgur.com/a/kF930k8
---
I've seen that too, but I wonder if that's just to level enchanting. The mats have to come from somewhere.
---
Yeah, and then the 2 major silithus patches are released, and alliance have to sit them out more or less, because they don't have the manpower to contest it.
---
And it will be blackrockmountains on crack, with no instances to hide inside.
---
I’ve never started a dungeon in Classic without 2-3 of the group members mentioning how they have run this a hundred times in Vanilla and on their alts.
---
Then they get super pissed if something goes wrong, like everyone knows all the boss mechanics and optimal strategies.
---
I feel you, OP
---
Wow did you fail remedial math or were you homeschooled by hillbillies?
---
Whats the bigger number. 2,500 or 10,000?
---
10,000 right?
---
When a server with 2,500 people is 60/40 Horde favored that means 1,500 Horde vs 1,000 Alliance.
---
The difference is 500 more people for the higher pop faction.
---
When a server with 10,000 is 60/40 Horde that means there are 6,000 Horde vs 4,000 Alliance.
---
That's a difference of 2,000 people for one faction, practically the population of a full server in Vanilla WoW days.
---
Imagine you had to fight the enemy faction on equal footing but they suddenly got an entire Vanilla server worth of reinforcements for only one faction.
---
The game world is simply not big enough physically for the number of people in it.
---
It's like if you scheduled two football games on the same field and made them play on the same field side by side. There simply is not enough room.
---
Do whatever you can find till 60. 
---
Around BRD you'll be able to start picking vastly better gear and can make trade-offs as you see fit. 
---
The ele on our raid team prefers mail. My PvP set will be mostly mail. My healing and dungeon set is mostly going to be cloth for Max SP/int bonuses.
---
Tbf molten core wasn’t released nerfed. My guild is clearing it with 30 people each week and 2-3 aren’t 60. This shouldn’t be happening. We aren’t geared
---
Earthshaker is more horde, but alliance is more aggressive. Good for them I guess
---
The metaphor is saying the overpopulated faction is killing all the other faction mercilessly, “fishing” them for honor. This causes the minority faction to quit or transfer. Thus, when he said “you killed” the server, he was correct because he’s describing this cycle of over fishing, and pushing people to leave. 
---
It’s not their fault they want to leave the server when they are being hunted mercilessly, and it’s not their problem you will no longer have any prey.
---
I’m going to stop responding now because clearly you aren’t super bright.
---
I just don't 1v1 on my disc/holy priest. I'm there to heal, dispel, mana burn, fear, and put lvl 1 SWP on rogues.
---
While I agree paladins are amazing utility, there's some shortfalls - mainly in their damage output capabilities. And honestly, that's okay. Druids also fall short in damage, but they have amazing utility and healing capabilities to compensate. 
---
What I do have a problem with and I routinely have to bash people for, is tunnel visioning into blind damage, and forgetting about the other 90% of their class. Yes you may be in a damage spec, but you also have heals, and utility abilities which are very VERY important. Example - arms warrior, just last night after charging into the enemy squad, I had to yell at him (more than once) to throw on a shield and pop shield wall as I was under massive CC pressure and couldn't help him at that time. He eventually got the picture and we pulled out ahead.
---
It's no big deal cause we have a warrior that got the eye before I joined the guild so he has first dibs on raid ingots. So yes by the time the second one could be built anyone would have the gold to make it
---
I spent 3 hours one evening, and another 3 hours the next day. Including once that I did complete it, but never got credit - guess I was too far away hiding behind a tree. The guy died, but his brother never showed up to rescue.
---
On the final time I got it, we were waiting for some guy to return after mistakenly opening the chest. Horde showed up, so we started it without him. He was super pissed, but his fault for opening the chest after we said not to.
---
Auctioneer is doing that for me too, glad it isn't just me.
---
He is generally correct, he should have said "die less" 
---
Stamina at least lets you survive a stun lock or a big opener, giving you enough time to HoT and bubble.
---
Huge shoutout to the horde for honoring the 1v1 and giving us Alliance players a chance to kill the boss and even helping us. Believe Prestige World Wide is to credit! &lt;3
---
I just wanna be the guild pet :(
---
I've been having similar questions myself in regards to Hit Cap. I found this video recently and liked the way it explained the hit table and what stats have priority in getting removed from the hit table.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRZaYkfBq3U
---
I believe 315 wep skill maybe overkill. I believe at 310 you make glancing blow damage reduction to almost nothing.
---
I think in regards to your original question as to how much +hit you should be rocking, I believe it totally depends on your current gear and crit cap. Everyone has been saying at 305 wep skill you only need 6% hit and 9% at 300 wep skill, but i believe thats not considering your gear and crit cap. Good luck!
---
haha
---
Cast slam just after your auto attack hits, no other time
---
Ok lets have it your way where you still don't get to participate in the gates event **and** continue to be camped in the world every hour of every day until then.
---
Being any tank spec for warriors sucks. I’m fury prot atm and feel utterly useless in pvp without tactical mastery at least
---
You probably grinded harpies or gnolls in the caves and Rams/Wolves
---
No thanks, idiots can't teach
---
I can't fathom why people with a rare recipe would do that stuff for free.
---
&gt;never looked up guides online.
---
And who's fucking fault is that?
---
&gt;...so you want them to make an even bigger mess, punishing even more players and making the game even more unplayable for more people and call that a solution?!
---
Yep, I think its better than doing nothing, and its true to vanilla. At least it has a carrot.
---
&gt;They had more than enough time to reroll before P2 if they felt like the game was punishing them for playing on the server they play on.
---
But nobody did that, because they didn't know what they signed up for due to layering.
---
I also just don't get it because why would you want someone who shares your interest to leave the game. If all the alliance players that got that message left the game, there would be no PvP in classic
---
Gosh I wish I could relate to this HORDE/alliance meta but on my server its so heavily ALLIANCE/horde that i feel disconnected from the subreddit posts on the subject :(
---
If you just want to make money disenchanting,  use a bank alt.
---
Warlock
---
I have no firsthand experience, I've just heard that it's incredibly difficult to make back your initial investment, there are probably plenty of 300 enchanters on your server already.  I suppose it could pay off through disenchants but that would take quite a while.
---
Regardless I'd say it's always worth it to drop skinning unless you've gotten Finkel's Skinner from UBRS.
---
Harpies indeed, I guess xp was removed or something
---
You really think no one has formed a bond over asking where hogger is? Hogger is freaking infamous for killing characters. I am sure some one has asked that and some one dying to hogger invited them to a party so they could team up to kill them. Some of those groups probably continued questing together and had a jolly good time.
---
Humans bond in all sorts of different ways and one person's pet peeves are how other people make friends. At the end of the day people are going to do them and if you don't like them asking "dumb" questions ignore them and move on.
---
lol I would be so mad
---
The risks are just as bad there, but you also have to deal with the 4+ rogues at the FP, then the rogues between the IF FP and the IF Bank.
---
That hasn't been enforced since like 2010.
---
From TP you end up quickly just waiting for death timer to go to zero, short deathwalk is not always a benefit at a high volume of death.
---
I will repeat myself. Fury Prot isn't even a threat increase over Deep Prot in your current gear. You will have the same threat problem on Onyxia that you did before. 
---
The reason you have threat issues on Onyxia is because you are tanking Onyxia's Knock Away ability, wiping your threat. This ability is actually only single target and it hits the CLOSEST PERSON IN FRONT OF ONYXIA. You should have a second tank or dps warrior standing in front of your main tank, eating flame breaths and Knock Aways. This will prevent you from eating threat drops in phase 1 and phase 3 and completely fix your threat issue. You are not doing the mechanics correctly, that isnt an excuse to go fury prot.
---
If you have threat issues on alliance side with deep prot, and your DPS are not pushing 1k+ DPS, you DO have a rotation issue in deep prot. I can post logs of prot players holding aggro over 1K dps. You will likely have to go back to prot for BWL anyways. You should fix your rotation instead of bandaiding it by dual wielding. 
---
There is a massive problem right now with everyone wanting to be fury prot, when their guild just doesn't need it. Then they try to steal fury gear, when they don't need it. Be a good tank and take what you need and nothing more.
---
Buffs will become more relevant but people act like you need 20 lotus per hour to raid naxx and that's just silly.
---
&gt;Man back in the day we had to do it all word of mouth.  I used to fax my cousin a hand drawn map made with crayons.
---
Come on man...you were off to a great copy-pasta style start, I was rooting for you...then you got all serious on me.
---
3/7 with rice, would not read again.
---
Thanks, that's why I didn't waste my time responding. Straw man 101. Somehow my mental state makes their actions morally sound.
---
The cap isn't 10k, its 6k.
---
Try again.
---
My guild does something similar to this. Each raider gets a set amount of "points" to spend on their desired items for the tier, and once everyone privately submits their loot list, we combine them and send out a summary sheet of each item's loot order so everyone knows when they're getting an item. There's no edits after the summary sheet goes out (aside from adding in new raiders), so we encourage collaboration beforehand to make things fair.
---
I guess so, but the same can be said for rogues who want priority on daggers like corehound despite swords being better in raid content. People want weapons they directly use sooner, and If we hunters can wait for our stat-stick, they can wait for theirs. Only one boss drops leaf and it requires another drop from Onyxia, plus a quest that gets griefed in current PvP enviornment.
---
I wouldn't think its remotely the same as mageblade going to a rogue.
---
Then again, its all just MC gear so it doesn't matter a whole lot really. Ranged weapons and even melee "hunter weapons" in later raids are often labeled a bit more obviously.
---
Druid: bearform which is equivilent to plate armor, self healing, can talent for instant cast heal (or swiftmend to consume a hot and burst heal), cleanse, movement ability in catform (dash), travel form, aquatic form, STEALTH.
---
Warlock: healthstone (minor heal), drain life (interruptable, channeled), pet which can serve some utility.
---
Yeah winner goes to druid.
---
Did you read what I wrote, or just pick out a couple of words? Why is the concept so difficult for you to grasp? You disagree and think there won’t be queues...well ok then. Good talk.
---
Its ok without imp slam ?
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
He said me. That means he assumed that I do what he suggested. I do not, making his statement just a stereotypical and incorrect metaphor for this situation. As I don’t Pvp and therefore this don’t apply to me. 
---
Having to repeat my self because someone doesn’t understand what , “ I don’t fish” means should usually be the one who is called dumb. But this is the Internet I guess and dumb people will call others stupid because they are not bright enough to figure out what being normal is. 
---
Go ahead and fuck off. This has moved beyond Sharing my opinion when someone resorts to ad-hominem. I’ll just block you, call this a win, and move on. 
---
If you have nothing relevant to say. And choose to use that time to insult someone. You have nothing left to say and submit your argument and everything you said was now irrelevant.
---
Being told you are playing badly is the helpful advice. Not sure why you don't seem to understand that. In some cases the answer to someone asking what they can do might be that they're not doing anything wrong and there is little to nothing that can be done. So being told that you are doing something wrong is helpful to know.
---
Obviously not everyone feels the same way or no one would be tanking for hire.
---
1-2 times? What server is this so I can reroll there?
---
Our faction on my server (won't say which because this isnt an Alliance or Horde only problem), you can expect to die AT LEAST 5 times on the way to BlackRock Mountain. And 5 is pretty generous.
---
TB is best city for horde mage.... AH, bank, forges, reagents, crafting supplies are all in the same 100~ yards of eachother
---
No idea where your guildie is getting that census data from, its not like he can get data from the horde side without an aggregation website like ironforge.pro or wowclassicpopulation.com.  Both of those show an incredible imbalance still, even if you limit the search to the last week or two.
---
No it wasn’t AFAIK
---
&gt;BGs could be cross-realm for the PvE servers I guess, since nobody plays on them anyways.
---
You spend too much time on Twitch/Reddit.
---
lmao no what you see is the aftermath of a 2 hour war where no one was getting anywhere being decided by mak'gora. No ones getting banned bud
---
Doubtful they will just flip a switch again.
---
You can't reliably keep up the stacks with just 1. If you want to maximize uptime you'll want at least 2 in the raid. 3 would probably be better.
---
r/woosh
---
The next raid will be BWL which is still in Blackrock Mountain, so there will still be congestion (or even more) when that comes out when the slow levelers finally start doing MC while others do BWL + MC...
---
&gt;Ok lets have it your way where you still don't get to participate in the gates event and continue to be camped in the world every hour of every day until then.
---
Its not even the gate event that big, its the patch before that. Where the world dragons and windstone bosses are released, thats the bloodbath patch.
---
And yes, I would rather have alliance keep being camped if it does help alleviate the server issue, since people can't play as efficiently outside of BGs.
---
I didn't have an issue with this quest, but I did it with a full group. We had some horde players camping the spawn and various locations along the path, but they weren't all working together so we rolled through them without any problems. It's designed as a group quest, so I'm not sure why so many people attempt to solo it. It's okay to ask for help, in fact this game requires it in a lot of cases.
---
308 is where glancing blow reduction stops coming in to play. Anything over that just goes to “hit chance increase”.
---
The lore in BfA is trash. Warcraft 3 had some of the best lore so naturally there was a large group of people that wanted to roll on RP for Classic to escape the bad writing and glowing armor for a more grounded experience. Looks like we got swamped with non-RPers flooding the servers and now I can't be bothered to finish getting to 60.
---
It's implied he would like to do other things but is unable to do so.
---
He's probably consistently near the top of the honor charts lol
---
Great answear, thanks a lot!
---
I stopped reading after the first sentence because wow that was cringe
---
315 would be the hit lvl of a 63. Defense stat of a 63 would also be 315. It make it even. The hit cap is "9%"
---
Quote from blizzard:
---
There is some code in 1.12 that explicitly adds a modifier that causes the first 1% of +hit gained from talents or gear to be ignored against monsters with more than 10 Defense Skill above the attacking player’s Weapon Skill.
---
This means that the so-called “hit cap” is in effect 9% rather than 8% for a player with 300 Weapon Skill fighting a level 63 monster with a Defense Skill of 315. With a Weapon Skill of 305, such as from Sword Specialization (Humans) or Axe Specialization (Orcs), this hit modifier is no longer in place against +3 level monsters, provided that you are using the appropriate weapon type to gain the passive bonus.
---
My conclusion from what I understand; the monsters lvl 63 wouldnt inore any % cuz your weapon skill is even with their defense skills. You would need 8% of hit chances to maximise it
---
I just start to understand... I'm not 100% sure.
---
&gt; die at least 1-2 times on the way to any high level instance.
---
I envy you.
---
The one on Wowhead seems to value +healing above everything else.  
---
It's not the worst list but just something to keep in mind.
---
As long as I spent less then 2 respeccs worth I'm fine. but atm I have a net plus from boss gold even when chucking greater mana potions on cooldown during bossfights. So I don't worry much. It won't work when AQ releases and in the beginning of BWL. But why specc for something that I only need 3 hours a week atm? I like to play the class, not the role.
---
Great source material on this topic was cited in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e3bido/rogue_question/) thread.
---
315 should leave you with a soft (yellow) cap of 5%.
---
cuz its ez to look up
---
I actually belly laughed at this.
---
I'm 48 so I'm not gonna reroll. Plus my friends play here.
---
The Nintendie Switch subreddit is for fucking losers
---
I can't speak to Ally because I'm Horde, but Resto shamans are always a very sought after class. Getting to 60 takes awhile, but once you're there it's not hard to find a raid group and get gear.
---
No lie, if your team is getting camped at wsg Gy, you probably didn't have any chance of winning in the first place.
---
I remember pugging BWL. I don't remember ever completing AQ 40 in a pug.
---
Are you Sylvanas?
---
It's usually phrased like "Duels no BM" for legit PvP. BM being bad-mannered in this instance.
---
It’s not that bad, there’s an entire faction of people who cannot kill you
---
Herb
---
I agree, I'm tired of being rolled over by alliance raid groups. Can't just have some fun small group PvP, gotta be entire raid groups.
---
Half the carebear Alliance on Stallag transfered off is why
---
I would think it’s stupid to claim practice then ask that people do things that wouldn’t ever happen in an open world PvP encounter.
---
I want PvP practice, everything goes. Do your best to put me in the dirt and I’ll do the same.
---
similar experience, it's rare to have a 1v1 in most places. Granted I've been doing most wpvp in Hillsbrad and STV so that is completely expected!
---
Burst, constantly apply r1 frostbolt, and essentially don't allow them to kite you, take the fight to them. When they let you get them to 60 percent or so, Chuck a grenade and wait for your burst.
---
No class is bad in endgame...only specific specs.  The consensus list is:
---
* Paladins and Shamans can tank early game and maybe 5-mans, but definitely not raids
---
* Boomkins and ret paladins are terrible dps and should only be used if you have a very specific raid need for them
---
The agree with you; however, sometimes I do sacrifice my time and go out of my way to help a guildie. 
---
But ... I also am a pushover...  so ...
---
Isn't that against ToS? You're abusing a mechanic in a way that is not intended.
---
Yeah man, i gave this response to 3 more comments, best solution for all these issues, join a nice guild and filter all the assholes. As to what i would do in that situation, of course i would take time to explain why the gear does not work even though he can wear it. But that does not work all the time, happened to me and saw it in a ton of let’s plays on youtube.
---
My point is that limiting BGs to your server only makes the issue worse for you. You said it yourself - you can't play efficiently outside BGs. So everyone will want to spam BGs. So you want to give them the opportunity to spam BGs because otherwise they will stay out in the world as it will be their only option to continue farming honor. So you want cross realm BGs to make the queues pop faster for horde so that you aren't camped anymore and hopefully see a return to pvp closer to that of P1.
---
Again though, that arguement would hold water if the MC epic ranges weapons besides Rhok were better than pre raid weapons, but they aren't. It makes sense to give someone a temporary upgrade in favor of giving someone else a stat stick, but how do you justify giving a hunter an item that's a downgrade from pre raid items when it's BiS for melee?
---
i gotchu ;) lol
---
Might help if we had your class and exact level (assuming its 49-50ish) but it sounds like it's time to find a guild with members that will run dungeons with you to help you cross the finish line. Peope leveling alts will be wanting to run ZF and Mara once they get there (avg alt level in my guild is mid-late 30s right now) but they may just be running with guildies. Or wait til next week, with the release of BGs you'll probably have more luck questing in searing gorge
---
ten of those are just different arena bosses.
---
combine lower and upper blackrock spire together and you'll have almost the same amount of bosses.
---
I'm still hopeful that after all the phases are done we get some kooky stuff like this, at least as temporary events.
---
Nobody deserves other people's time or effort. It's a bonus. A gift.
---
I read it.  What you wrote isn’t compelling.  You just sounded snarky and elitist while you’re literally basing your entire argument on watching a streamer and hearing them complain.  You can not deny that thousands of players both horde and alliance are not waiting to play BGs for honor.  Thousands of alliance and horde will get instant queues because of the demand.  It is an absolute lie to think that people will stop playing AV or WSG anytime soon in classic horde or alliance as it will be the most efficient way to get honor and ranks and overall have a more fair experience against the other faction.  Can *you* read?
---
So you’re essentially admitting some alliance basically doesn’t have the constitution for pvp and as a horde player I should not only recognize that but adapt my play-style so that I can make your experience enjoyable? 
---
Nah, I think I won’t.
---
He actually does have a secondary account with a horde toon on server so I presume he did a live pull.
---
Did you end up buying it?
---
To be honest, I would just want crossrealm delayed by a bit. Not forever, just for a few months.
---
Servers back in the day, your name carried weight and your reputation was meaningful. I was known to be a very strong warlock with trash-tier gear. So in BG's I would have people who would charge past my entire team just to suicide dive for me, knowing if I lived for any length of time, their healers would be turned to ash.
---
On my current server, we have some strong rivalries... or at least a few guilds who just hate each other and will hunt each other across the world to slaughter each other in small scale or larger scale fights. Having those premades go up against each other would be really intense and could lead to some fun gameplay.
---
But with crossrealm, the chance of running into premades from your own server will be low. And the community feel that we all have been craving.... will be lost.
---
Pro tip. If you are an alliance priest you can camp him and disp ö any horde that comes into the room, making them lose the disguise and basically guaranteeing a death for the horde player.
---
:)
---
U know what would be funny tho, is if since your outnumbered and being petty AF that the horse prevented your faction from entering stratholme entirely and also had 3x as many eyes as you do..  hurrr durr critical thinking
---
You mean the, fuck everyone else, hands off MY loot attitude?  No, I'm not going to agree to that philosophy.  And if a warrior gets pissy because I don't 'respect' his BiS list, I don't really care.  He's not a tank, he's a dime a dozen warrior dps.  He tops meters and doesn't care about the rest of the group, raid, or guild.  So why reward that behavior?
---
I think you got it spot on
---
A horde post complaining about alliance camping fp’s? 
---
You’re a brave one, lets see how the sun reacts.
---
A note on the Onyxia mechanic. She uses Knock Away and Wing Buffet. They both knock back. Wing buffet will be aoe knock back and still knock you back, but it doesn't wipe threat. You should notice yourself getting knocked back about 1/4-1/2 of the time as before and not feel any threat wipe if done correctly.
---
Sometimes people think that since they are still getting knocked back, it is not working. But it is.
---
Yes, in this scenario a rogue will put shadow oil on his weapon, giving it a chance on hit to cast a rank 3 shadowbolt. With spellpower flask this becomes quite a bit better than poisions
---
Small indie company.
---
Yes. I see tons of shadow dps.
---
Why should they be worth less for alliance?
---
&gt;All of these things would have been fixed in Vanilla if they had been the problem they are now
---
Most of these things actually were fixed, if anything, by becoming irrelevant.
---
&gt;They actively corrected potential inflation issues from such farming methods frequently back then to prevent the type of problems we are seeing
---
Yes, there were mistakes made, people pointed it out or abused it and Blizzard fixed it at some point, slowly but steadily, from expansion to expansion. People felt like getting from one point to another was a mistake so Blizzard gave them flying, people felt like too much gold in the economy is bad, so Blizzard gave them gold sinks, people felt it's too much of a chore to build group and travel to dungeon, so they got LFR and LFG. 
---
If you want changes, go to retail. If you want classic, play it as it is and don't complain: complainers ruined it and made it retail.
---
You don't realize how stupid you are, so i'm done with this conversation.
---
If someone uses a potion in world pvp, you copy him and its now a duel situation as practiced....if you still don't get it, don't bother replying to me.
---
I remember seeing your response to a question about the BRD grim guzzler bar event. Your answer just wasn't helpful (and I don't mean to be rude or offensive). I wasn't the one asking the question, but I was interested in seeing responses because I have actually googled it and looked it up on wowhead or another site. I did a "tiny bit of research" and still was confused about the event. I was looking to do more research and hear from other people what was involved with the event. Sometimes people do the research and don't find the answer they are looking for, so they ask questions to people who might know the answer. I would argue that this is doing further research. Maybe you should give people the benefit of the doubt. I find most people asking questions have usually done the basic research and are looking to learn more than what they found on wowhead for a deeper understanding.
---
Epic mount don’t be the only headass without one
---
Its funny because our tanks actually want to go BACK to prot to PvP better LOL.
---
&gt;And on top of that 
---
Heh
---
Was following a group through wc, first time as a hunter.  When I joined the group I asked how much ammo to bring.  I dismissed my pet before we jumped.  I guess at one point we were skipping some mobs and I should've dismissed my pet again?  
---
We wiped, and the mages were getting really toxic saying it was my fault and how terrible I was, thanks for wiping the group, etc.  I had joined them right after the tank and another dps had left... I can see why those 2 people left.  I immediately ditched out.
---
Here's a tip: reroll before its too late.
---
Except with 3 eyes per person since every horde can get them too, super duper good plan alliance
---
🚓Rule 7 police!🚓
---
Ok keep doubling down on a topic you know little about while clearly not reading the guy's responses. lmao
---
That's a more advanced question that people really aren't telling people to "go google". Although detailed internet searching is a good place to start to find Youtubers/streamers, etc. that actually know what they're doing and have good advice. But beyond that you'd need to have detailed conversations and practice with friends/guildies for something like that.
---
I suspect they're going to be pretty lenient about anything that involves giving them more money every month.
---
Ofc you need to know the basics of how to heal in a dungeon. But spitting out prebis and knowing spirit to mp5 conversion on top of your head. Fuck off with that, im just having fun.
---
Ya I have heart of mountain and for dps rune of guard cpt and want hoj bad.
---
Don't know don't have kids. Just live Ina rural area
---
Is nice
---
lol, who the hell thinks of this shit
---
I don't know how it will be here but the downside to your idea is that it allows the 15 Horde pursuing that Ally player to be queued while out in the world ganking.
---
I would switch blacksmithing for skinning or herbalism if you’re after money
---
Who tf let Zdeeps do it?!?!? Honorable still but bad pokemon to choose to represent the mighty horde
---
Yeah, I’m sure you’re right and it will go perfectly smooth and no queues. Looking forward to it!
---
AH alerts set up? xD :O
---
You mean druids do best by outlasting their opponent. Druids have 2 "bad" matchups - shadowpriests and warlocks. (And I use bad in quotations as it's still really winnable just may take a lot of focus)
---
Warlocks have 5 BAD matchups - warlocks, rogues, hunters, some mages, and spriests. Warlock into a warrior, it's not even close. Warlock gets destroyed. Even my buddy who is a geared soul link warlock, gets crushed by warriors. Nothing against him, you just can't get the warrior off you. (Due to Berserker rage/deathwish) As well as you can't tank the warrior for long, as your pet gets killed in seconds.
---
So yeah, believe what you will, but if you want a class who will actually SURVIVE in the open world, druid. You aren't forced to take a fight you don't want to. You can run, you can hide. You can use hit and run tactics against your enemy to fatigue them. Druids have more of a chance than warlocks do. There's no place for you to run or hide, you have to stand your ground, even if outnumbered or outmatched, and usually die as a result.
---
Loneliest? Dude is getting paid the same auctioneer salary as those jabronis in Ironforge but doesn't have to do any work. He's living the emerald dream.
---
Isn’t the mount from the same boss more rare?
---
I am trying BRD for the first time as a 53 Mage.  Who drops my pre BiS stuff? Anything I should know?
---
I'm a-firin' my fireball!
---
1.	I don’t really understand your first point, is it supposed to be sarcastic? Because it’s not just getting gankend and camped for 2 hours. It’s always when I try to play. But that’s probably my fault for not reaching 60 before phase 2. Should’ve taken time of work to be able to play atleast 3 hours every day instead. Yeah, maybe I made a mistake by choosing to play with my friends. Why am I not allowed to fix that now? It’s not that I want to move a fully geared PvE character to a PvP server, I would Ideally be able to finish getting my warrior to 60. This feels impossible now. Restarting will take me months again, not a worthwhile investment for me. 
---
2.	The servers will die eventually in the current state. If all the allies on your server just get ganked without pause there’s no reason for new people to join, or for others to keep playing. Also the servers are over populated, so losing some people doesn’t sound that bad. That way you might actually get to walk a few feet in game before you get corpse camped again. These servers have 4x the population than the original ones, but the map is not 4 times bigger. Right now it just feels like you don’t want people to transfer because they *might, maybe, eventually* comeback. Well chances are just as big that they won’t at all, even though they might want to play. But actually play, not just get killed and spit on over and over. That’s not genuine wPvP, it’s griefing. Griefing that Blizzard allows (and encourages), but that doesn’t make it not be griefing.
---
3.	People are already deciding quiting is worth it. It is for me, the wPvP and leveling was pretty fun before phase 2. Now it’s not fun anymore, so while I would like to keep playing, I’d rather actually play something I enjoy instead of running to my corpse for an hour before I have to log off. You can even see the dropoff if you look at the activity in on those census websites. I’ll keep checking this subreddit in hope that transfers open up, but that’ll be my involvement with WoW for the time being.
---
4.	It’s also the way Blizzard is turning me off playing WoW. Maybe this is fun for the people who had enough time to prepare or people who play rogues, but try leveling your 53 warrior. I can barely make it to a dungeon in the time I have. Why bother at all at this state. When I remember the old classic I rember getting ganked *sometimes* but I still managed to get to 60. Right now I’ll just give up. Maybe I’ll come back when I feel like starting over but I’m not going back to a PvP server.
---
Like wise, don’t bother replying if you’re just going to gloss over some stuff :)
---
A paladin telling someone to earn their mount is pretty entertaining.
---
I feel like I see mostly mages rogues and warriors when I’m trying to look for groups.
---
removed but not removed? kk
---
telling someone to google something isn't really advice
---
You mean Gnomeregan? It’s often safer there than in IF at the moment.
---
Pay them no mind and let them leave, Im about 90% sure they're not going to find a guild that is willing to help 100 percent of the time.
---
Typical deflection when things aren’t going your way.  Much easier than just dealing with facts.  Good luck with that.
---
The meta is Arms for everything, except PvE dps and tanking (where fury and prot are better).  
---
Arms is the best leveling, pvp, lvl 60 dungeon dps/tank spec by far.
---
Lol who downvotes this story? They’d be on my kos list too.
---
Ahhhhhh, go to retail arguement. Got it. Pointless conversation with someone who didnt actually play vanilla.
---
I would say that's not obvious at all
---
Your approach is the 'normal' approach most people take.
---
There are some guilds and players that will drop everything to help people whenever they ask but generally that is if they are helping a specific player gear up for a specific task (ex: getting a new tank quickly geared for raiding.)
---
It's hard to say if the guy is being entitled or not though.  If let's say over 2 weeks he puts out an offer or request for some help with some kind of task every time he's logged in and nobody takes him up on it then I don't blame him if he feels like this isn't the guild for him.  Some people expect at least a certain amount of engagement with their guild and if they are never able to do anything with guild members they don't see the point in remaining in that guild.
---
On the other hand if he's just some guy that asked for help 2 or 3 times for something time consuming that is completely useless for everyone else in guild and then is just mad that people aren't dropping everything to help him then he's just being entitled and it's better that he wants to leave anyway.
---
Yes. Doesn't matter what happened in vanilla it's an exploit and once noticed it will be punished. Timeframe is iffy, slow and all that.
---
&gt;In conclusion, I don't believe there is anything Blizzard can do about faction inbalance
---
y'know, back at 60 when I tried to roll on Arthas the game literally told me to go fuck myself and play elsewhere because the server was **full**
---
agro reset is raid wide and independent on who gets knocked or if you resist it or not. 
---
Who gets knocked is also determined by GUID btw. These days, we just have our OT tank it cus he has a high GUID and will never get knocked and I (the MT) just soak the knock with my super low GUID along with a couple other low GUID warriors. 
---
Resisting knockbacks if you are tanking boss just means you dont have to stance dance and lose pooled rage for re-establishing agro after the threat wipe.
---
Check out the rag section of the fight club discord if you wanna know more.
---
How is this less complicated then a simple round robin, have class leaders keep track and let people roll or tell them to STFU and loot council everything
---
What in the actual fuck lol
---
Dragon's Call
---
For real if this starts being a thing I'll just soak the dks myself  all my gear is better than anything sub r12 so...  Wooopity dooo.   In the meantime I will be corpse camping to the extreme anyone I see try to use an eye even if they don't work...
---
tbc was the pinnacle of wow you take that back
---
What is it?
---
you can get an addon that does it for you.
---
This AH sucks ass. The mailbox is so far away, and even if you wanted to stop by after landing at the nearest flightmaster, it's still a \~20-30 second mount ride to even get to him.
---
You’re a warrior, he should’ve won anyway..
---
You are alliance, you don't understand. Fury prot on Horde has basically been mandatory for the past few months even for your average, decent guild. If you push beyond 550-600dps you just don't have enough TPS.
---
I don't think it's unreasonable to be annoyed at the entitlement.  Not all guilds have the manpower or inclination to help with stuff like that all the time.
---
Maybe it's just not a good fit for him.  Plenty of big guilds out there that focus on mutual assistance and lowbie runs.
---
I logged in like 4 am server time (I play on a west coast server, but I'm east coast) and was able to do the quest, then help a buddy afterwards as well. Towards the end of that though .. people were starting to wake up, and pick fights. Plus the end of it is right where you farm for crusader.
---
&gt; Yep, I think its better than doing nothing,
---
I disagree, doing something stupid isn't better than doing nothing.
---
&gt; and its true to vanilla.
---
How so? 
---
&gt; But nobody did that,
---
Of course there are people who did that.
---
&gt; they didn't know what they signed up for due to layering.
---
Of course they did. Servers had a login queue, that was a pretty clear indication you were better off playing somewhere else. As soon as you'd hit STV or any other PvP zone, you knew which faction was dominating your server, even with layering.
---
&gt; Which again is Blizzard fucking up.
---
The problem isn't that Blizzard fucked up, there are simply more people who play Horde than Alliance, no matter what Blizzard did, there would've been players trying to find a server where Alliance would be the majority and there's not much Blizzard could've done about it, except maybe prevent players from creating characters on an unbalanced server, but considering how many people were part of a guild before the game even launched, it's not like every player even chose the server they play on, as their guild chose it for them.
---
Just look at [WoWHead's census data from a few months back](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community). No matter what Blizzard did, the best possible outcome would be every PvP server having a 43% Alliance / 57% Horde population.
---
Is that really much better than having a few Alliance-dominated servers, having a few balanced servers and having a huge majority of Horde-dominated servers? At least there's variety...
---
I moved to Heartseeker around the time that census was published, when it was 54/46, thinking that was balanced enough. Had I known it would become ~75/~25, I wouldn't have picked it, obviously, but in the end, I'm glad to see we still have a bunch of Horde who are willing to wPvP and that they're even capable of holding their own for a while, at least until the cavalry rolls in.
---
My main isn't enchanting but I do wish she was sometimes. All that soulbound trash, sometimes mats are more.
---
Quest somewhere else? I'm on the same server and I've been questing in Kalimdor from 45-55 with little problem.
---
does it REALLY proc frostbite? Pretty sure it still says IMMUNE, but shows the animation for some reason for a split second.
---
The economy is fine. It's not the same as it is on bigger servers, but there's nothing wrong with it, it still works. There's less supply and less demand.
---
If you think this constitutes a "dead" server you obviously haven't actually been on one.
---
Yeah, I am rather frustrated over the lack of key ring, but I am just glad I could play a version of the game I loved the most.
---
Classic is one of the eras of WoW I very much enjoyed. TBC is my ALL-TIME favorite era - had such interesting (lore wise) raids, as well as classes had more options (thankfully), and even heroic dungeons were a step in the right direction!
---
I am just hoping Blizzard will actually take the money they are getting from classic, and re-invest it in its future.
---
&gt;For pvp, Warlock is most braindead.
---
Warlock is easy to do OK with but the difference between a good warlock and a shit one is larger than any other class.
---
- Professions are a great way to make gold, a lot of warriors are miners or herbalists and gather from the world  
---
- Sell your services out at instances, most Strath Live runs will happily reserve a Righteous Orb for a warrior since there's no warrior loot in there  
---
- Find level 55~ caster mobs and farm there, physical DPS is amazing against these guys and having a 5~ level advantage lets you safely deal with a good amount o them
---
This type of situation, in general, can go both ways.  
---
Guildies not helping out is a solid reason to go elsewhere.  
---
At the same time having constant insensate begging, which turns to complaining, is annoying as hell and will cause even less people to want to help. Those people who insist then complain if their hand isnt held for literally every action they take in game are awful people to be around.  
---
So, is your guild unhelpful or is this one of the guys from the 2nd set?  
---
if hes a 2nd set guy, ignore him  
---
if your guild truely is unhelpful, think about maybe finding somewhere better for yourself.
---
its a numbers game. You can't group up because the enemy can group up more. So in the end you won't be fighting 1vs5 you'll be fighting 10vs50 and 40vs200.
---
&gt; This shield is a good epic
---
It's honestly not. Compare it to Aegis of the Scarlet Commander and the difference is negligible if not the ~250 additional armor favours the aegis. 
---
And aegis drops in one of the most beloved leveling instances where people spend entire levels in.
---
We have a mage on my server that’s top 5 and he’s garbage in open world pvp. But he does this at the if ah 10 hours a day lol
---
The auctioneers get a cut of sales. This guy is broke as fuck. Probably missing mortgage payments on his tree while his wife is banging a satyr.
---
&gt;1-2 times? What server is this so I can reroll there?
---
Oh it definitely also depends on the time, instance, and so on. Currently 4 deaths in on my way to strath.
---
Sometimes the /follow will get spaced out with lag a bit, so it;s hard to say from such a short clip, but yeah, I agree, pretty sure they're bots.
---
I did it the other day after failing it the first few tries... granted a couple of those were due to being ganked mid-quest.  The third though I just straight up failed because I didn't use my mana efficiently.
---
I figured that I was using Flash Heal way too much, and I was wasting mana healing peasants who were already near the end and about to despawn.
---
Downrank your Renew to Rank 3 and Flash Heal to Rank 4.  I might have those mixed up, I know the Renew is the one that costs 185 mana.  Then downrank your Holy Nova to I think Rank 4.  And buy a few Major Mana potions because you will need them, or use Dark/Demonic Runes if you have those.
---
Tilt your camera as high up as it will go so that you can see individual nameplates clearly and click on the right guy without too many problems.
---
Once it starts, just let the Plagued Peasants go.  I think they are saveable but they're more trouble than they're worth as they outpace the rest of the group.  Toss a Renew on any peasant in the 60-70% health range or lower, and only use Flash Heal if they are below like 20% health and about to die.  Limit Flash Heal as much as possible, but you'll probably end up using a few.  Of course cleanse diseases off anybody who's green.  
---
When the adds start showing up, try to position your character behind the Peasants so the mobs will aggro to you instead of them, wait until there are four of them and then use one Holy Nova.  You should only need one to kill four at once.  If you find you have a straggler or two by themselves, either wand them down or just deal with them until the next wave arrives.  You don't really want to be blowing multiple Holy Novas on a single group of mobs because it's an expensive spell.  
---
Pop your Mana potion when you are at around 40 percent mana, not when you're oom.  If you wait until you're oom, the cooldown won't be up by the time you need to use it again.
---
And last but not least if the peasants are near the finish line by the quest giver, don't waste heals on them unless they are absolutely critical and about to die.  If they're at around 40% health by the time they reach her, they'll usually be fine.  Once you can see that the wave is safely through, you should be running back to the next wave as quickly as possible to prevent the mobs from killing everyone in the next wave.
---
That's about all the advice I can think of, you can also pop some extra pots or a Nightfin Soup for some extra mana regen.  Past that, it's just a lot of trial and error.  Don't try to keep count, just focus on each wave and eventually you'll get enough by like the fourth wave.
---
Just to spread this info more that a lot of people have missed knowing about.
---
Agro wipes every time he uses his knock up ability. Knock up targets are determined by GUID and is independent of the threat wipe.
---
 Means if you have a couple low GUID warriors soak all the knockups, melee never have to move in and out.
---
&gt; I think it's incredibly self-centred of you to imply that there's something wrong (lazy and disrespectful) of him asking questions.
---
I'm not implying anything - he literally said he prefers to ask questions of people in game in order to save time. If that's not lazy and disrespectful I don't know what is. Here's his quote - 
---
&gt;If you know the right answer and could answer me in 1 minute of typing, why would I logically spend 10 minutes googling something?
---
Not gonna lie...that’s awesome. On a pve realm would they get flagged? I assume not
---
No, I want the factions to be balanced before the AQ patches.
---
So if I have to be camped for a few more weeks, I am fine with that.
---
PvP guides are bad by definition. You cannot teach PvP via text. Even in video format, it's basically impossible.
---
I can tell you what things to do, but remembering to do them in the heat of the moment is a wholly different story. I can also explain to you why I'm doing the things I do, but you can't really explain the nuances that dictate when that logic stops holding, or you'll just be uncertain as to how to identify the "signs" in the first place.
---
Really, the only things that PvP guides and the likes achieve is just creating a bunch of people that "do the right thing", but don't understand *why* they're doing it, or when they shouldn't. A classic case for me is quite a few PvP videos in which druids just shapeshift a ton. For sure, shapeshifting a ton is "what good druids do", except unlike genuinely good druids, these guys aren't achieving much with their shapeshift spam.
---
Sometimes their choice of which shapeshift to use is illogical, or they just press a bunch of shit as soon as they shapeshift instead of having a clear goal as to what they even want to do with the shapeshift. It becomes clear that they're just doing it because they've seen/heard that they should be shapeshifting and using abilities from all forms.
---
My personal recommendation is to just watch a ton, play a ton, analyse a ton. Ideally from as many different viewpoints (i.e. classes). There is no guide that will help you, for you need to learn your own version of the knowledge. Instead of being given an explanation that you won't fully comprehend/remember in the heat of the moment, form your own ideas. You won't forget them, and you can reason about when your own theories perhaps don't hold up anymore, much better than when using theory of others. Of course you can still read up on what decision making logic other people use, but don't let it dictate your own choices. PvP is far too volatile to ever just "go by the book".
---
The same reason why someone would give a dagger that's a downgrade from pre raid  sword spec when its BiS for hunter as a stack stick?
---
Those elites hit very hard, and as a non-60 warrior you don't have a lot of healing options to deal with the damage they put out.  As soon as I'd start hitting them they'd pull aggro to me and crush me. Even if I waited and only attacked the mob that the escort guy had already hit a few times, the others would turn to me if I got too close and escort hadn't hit them already. Usually he'd just target 1 mob and focus that one until it was dead, but he'd only kill maybe 2 or 3 out of the pack of 5 before they'd already killed him.

You're participating in a multiplayer activity. Have the decency to do your part and be informed. You have an inherent responsibility to the people you play with to try and do your job well.
---
Stick to single player games if "It'S jUsT a GaMe BrO" is your logic.
---
Yes, but pretty sure you have to be alive to accept the queue pop.

Skinning is useless endgame. You only need 1 active skinner who attends Onyxia and MC everynight.

because it is a player versus player server...kinda in the name
---
I would strongly advice to not stack that much weaponskill, but yellow cap is 5% at 315
---
That is why DKP guilds are really dumb.  An enhancement shaman that saves all their DKP getting poop gear at the lowest common denomenator should not be allowed to take a band of accura or a spinal reaper even if they have the most dkp to bid.
---
Man, a lot of times, I’ve already checked google and looked at guides. The information they provide is often lacking, not thoroughly explained, or downright wrong. Often, they’ll give a good framework but how things actually work in-game is better learned by discussion. 
---
The most profound example I can think of are bis lists. Before Classic release, nearly every hunter bis list included Dal’Rends. However, by talking to an experienced hunter in my guild I found that that’s only if you get the set bonus AND have +15 agi enchants (which aren’t in game). The better course of action was to pick up a Peacemaker.
---
If you spellcleave, priest is the fastest ride to 60. Healers in general are needed. Server population will determine how needed exactly but healers can always group. 
---
Once you hit 52, level 52-60 in BRM and you will leave it with most of your prebis
---
The alliance fp to scholo is hinterlands.
---
It’s insane to me that people don’t understand this, it’s glaring
---
This is the most civil comments section I've seen in a long time, and it's because people are talking about how good the in-game community is. Heartwarming.
---
The bad news is that this solidarity is at OP's expense because OP is definitely talking about the reddit community and he's absolutely right. ty OP o7
---
He's about to go rob it.
---
I think there's a huge risk that it might happen. On private servers jumps were allowed because they added a whole new dimension to the bg which is awesome
---
Who dies after ganking Lmao, what a dog shit mage. If you can't gank and live to gloat/teabag your bad at the game. Unsub, toss your pc and lookup noose tying on Google.
---
I use Auctioneer along with Enchantrix -- though you have to be sure your AH scan is up to date, and you have to set Enchantrix to use that data instead of its default prices.
---
It's impossible to accommodate everyone. Blizzard chose to accommodate most.
---
I made it a point to be the first person logged in my server. I still cant find anyone with a lower GUID than me lol. So we cant really do that strat. And the other tank has a GUID 1 higher than me. So when we are going for speedclears he tanks and i soak it.
---
Lol even still 555g is a steal. I would buy that in a heartbeat
---
Quite the opposite. He's calling me "an anti-social prick" in order to avoid having to agree that I have a valid point to make, so he tries to shut me down with insults and anger.
---
Perhaps back in 2007, in 2019/2020. It absolutely isn't.
---
That expansion is a joke with its current metagame(which will transfer to classic TBC if they make that mistake).
---
When everyone has access to the same information, we expect them to make decisions based on that info.
---
Has anyone hit the gold cap yet, if so what is it?
---
Atleast Carrot on a stick from zf. I had a bunch of engineering truckers in my thirty’s. Plus the stopwatch.
---
You seem like a nice person
---
You are wrong
---
Interesting.. I'll give that a shot. Thanks for the info
---
I think this is all situational. You shouldn't expect your guild mates to drop everything and rush to your aid every time you need something, but you should expect some help from your guild occasionally. It also depends on culture of the guild. Is this guild a community or a vehicle for raid drops? Sacrificing to help other people in your guild will help build the community aspect of the guild and will hopefully translate to better teamwork later on.
---
His argument is simply that the HoJ is a higher dps benefit to warriors over hunters.  He continues to say that the gear he wears isn't replaced anytime soon.  That's about it.  I don't know the itemization of warriors and hunters.  I'm not going to dive into the lists and spend the time to figure out the specific cases.  I looked up several boots and, shocker, they weren't pre raid BiS for either one.  I wonder why the priest doesn't know warrior and rogue BiS lists...
---
I don't agree with his philosophy of BiS only.  And that's the crux of it all.  You can keep laughing from the sidelines all you want.
---
What do you mean, your compelling argument made me change my mind. So many facts you came up with, I just can’t help but be excited now that there won’t be any queues. Should be awesome!
---
Same! My lvl 60 isn't even attuned yet and it's been a while.
---
Thanks, will give it a shot
---
Yeah well it’s unreasonable to tell that to shammie who earned the DKP.
---
So are you talking to the horde in discord?
---
I’m going to go against the grain here and say that player has a point, because otherwise what’s the point of being in a guild? It’s more than just having a second name listed under your character name in brackets.
---
Maybe I’m just old school, but part of a 60s job in a guild, when not running raids, is helping lowbies level up so they can start raiding too.
---
It appears most people here just want to say they’re *in* a guild, they don’t want to actually *be* a guild. 
---
And for the record I’m not ever the one asking for help, I’m usually the one doing all the helping while the other high levels hang out in Ironforge and complain they’re bored and have nothing to do.
---
I was wondering same thing. This looks smoother than my actual gameplay.
---
This bad experience just means when you finally do have your necklace, you get get sweeeeet revenge killing enemy players on the quest. I got killed like 5 times doing it, was definitely triggered but now I get to kill horde on the quest and make them equally triggered =D That’s just Classic!
---
Lol warlocks don’t have a bad matchup against hunters. Warlocks counter hunters.
---
As I said, there are plenty of examples of warriora passing BiS to rogues. Your just new and arent aware of them. Your example of chromatic boots vs shadowflame boots illustrates that.
---
It is not a fuck you,  hands off my loot  thing. I dont get mad at rogues for rolling on HoJ. I get mad at hunters who its not even bis for, doesnt proc for them,  and can solo it if they want it.
---
I wpuld never roll on the bis hunter bow even if it was a stat upgrade for me. Its actually bis tanking stats. Still wouldn't steal it from a hunter. I give them that respect and expect the same.
---
You losing rolls to mages is sad. But I am posting correct info to try to help more ppl be aware and correct that behavior. Just because you got fucked for tooth of gnarr doesnt mean everyone should. 
---
Usually healer gear is pretty easy to yoink with only you healing in the group. Maybe you should try to find a guild so you dont have to deal with idiots in pugs all day.
---
Do not use the F****t word please. Consider this a warning 
---
TIA
---
Why because you suck at pvp?
---
OMG - I played on Agamaggan in 05-08 or so and was briefly in Blatant Disregard as well. Small world.
---
Voulez vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?
---
Don't mind me I'm just the warrior that took perds after farming for a compendium since DM came out. To be fair there's three of them in the guild so far. 8 clears 3 perds.
---
Stabby.
---
So I plan to make a twink like most people. My question is: Is there a minimum level to which a character can get dungeon gear? If I have gear in wailing caverns can I get gear as a level one character?
---
Comments like these are why I Reddit.
---
I'm MT for my guild as a troll warrior, they're effectively the best threat tanks Horde has to offer, Berserking is no joke.
---
The only macro I have is one that switches me to berserker stance, cast berserk rage and switches me back to defensive, otherwise I don't really need macros.
---
The troll health regeneration racial is pretty damn bad and you'll probably never even notice it.
---
The reason to pick troll is because berserking is extremely good.
---
Just pop down a repair bot and repair when it breaks.

99% of all nono words gets automodded. You have multiple warnings. Please be nicer to people.

Thanks friend

Are you doing the Heroic Strike toggle trick to make sure your offhand hits land?
---
Do both of you have Edgemaster's Handguards?
---
So you like to feel like a hero huh
---
Screen capping this to show our guilds 5 rogues this xD we only had one perds drop since launch!
---
Running is a flat +5%, jumping is 7%, and casting anything while doing a Nelf jumpflip makes it automatically crit.

You can only enter dungeons as of a certain level.  This is specific to each dungeon.

---
Going to sound like a dick here but if you need somebody to cheese your class quest, you don't deserve to complete it.  It's a benchmark for how well you can play the class.
---
You could use rune of the guard captain and the 22 ap trinket from DM.
---
This is not uncommon.  I think sometimes people who are newer to the game or younger do not understand that joining a guild doesn't mean receiving free hand-outs.  In general, you get out what you put in.  When someone in my guild had a similar outburst, I didn't initially know how to respond, but then I thought to myself -- this person never says hello when they come online, they don't help other people, and yet they're getting upset that high levels aren't dropping what they're doing to help them.  
---
I think it's helpful to remind people that *joining* a guild is just a first step to building relationships that result in people wanting to help you.  Not only do you need to join the guild, but you need to *participate* and demonstrate that you are willing to provide the same type of help that you'd like to receive.
---
Usually the people that get helped are the officers and longtime members. 
---
In other words: the people with long established relationships that drive them to put in extra effort for one another. For a stranger to expect such treatment is dictionary entitlement.
---
They're both right. The people on the extremes for either side are annoying. You can show up being inexperienced and ask questions, without needing to be hand held through every detail. And you can 'teach people to fish' without being an elitest asshole.
---
There are a million variables to consider.
---
Warriors are not mages when it comes to pve dps rotations. You have a lot of decisions to make. When to use cooldowns, when to dump rage with HS or Cleave, when or if to drink a mighty rage potion, etc. These decisions have a huge impact and can make a warrior in full phase 2 raid BiS easily lose to a pre raid warrior.
---
Also, world buffs and consumables. Having you world buffs and consumables is worth literally like 5 times more than the difference between raid gear and dungeon gear. If he has more buffs than you and doesn't lose them hell destroy you.
---
Finally, weapon skill. If you're both humans then swords are much better than axes unless you're using edgemasters. It's such a huge difference that you would probably do better with brutality blade mainhand and mirahs song offhand if you're human.
---
any use of any n word gets your comment automatically removed by automod on r/classicwow. Do not use them ty.
---
I am a dwarf with Edgemasters, He is a human with devilsaur. We both are above hit cap. I am not toggling Heroic Strike but just using it regularly
---
Demo shout still generates threat. They didn’t make it generate 0 lol
---
Mods tend to be sad powerless people IRL so they take it out on the internet, without this, THEY ARE NOTHING. If only they could see themselves as we see them, fat fatties with console commands. They should enjoy their internet powers while they can, NOTHING LASTS.
---
These sort of people are not uncommon. And it's usually not a little bit of help they are asking for either. They want level 60s to come out and run their level 35 character though ZF or some nonsense. Usually the best option is to just ignore them.
---
I understand, it's a bit of a nuanced question. In theory stacking weapon skill is impractical, but in practice we don't have every single item in our bank, and have to work with the items we have. I was just wondering if I could swap out my wyrmhide spaulders for something else if my +hit was redundant given a 315 weapon skill.
---
&gt;  I don't know the itemization of warriors and hunters.
---
lmao love it when they double down on ignorance

Considering I am on the second biggest US East server Herod I got to 2100 Standing this week.  I call that a huge win for me since I am a casual who works fulltime, hangs out with my fiance, family, and friends.  Also I am only rank 53 so I  have been getting steam rolled by 60 alliance gank squads in literally every zone I have been to that is 45+
---
If somehow I could make it to rank 999 I would be super happy.  The amount of Horde on Herod is insane!!!
---
&gt; as my friends are the sort to say,” I don’t need SM any more so why would I run it?”
---
Those aren't very good friends.
---
It's funny how you're acting like you're wasting his time when you're the one wasting your time lol
---
I remember doing it. At lvl 70. And it was still difficult as fuck.
---
If you haven’t done it already, I’m pretty sure you can get an additional 10% discount if your friend is a certain PvP rank.
---
Haha i love your group man. Much respect.  -Ubey
---
Mage water
---
Mages I can see with food/ports/aoe farming, but what makes hunters so good?
---
I found that although GH was a little more mana efficient, my the time my GH went off in raid, someone had already beat me to healing that person with heal / flash heal / lesser healing wave, etc so my GH was not only almost always 100% overheal, but taking more time away from healing someone else. Right now I just spam heal and maybe renew or PoH...
---
This is wrong. Your offhand hits don't get that 19% penalty while HS is toggled, but they'll still need 9% hit when his mainhand only needs 6.
---
Yeah I am normally the MT but I have a super low GUID too so I am on soak duty for Rag.
---
Trolls are good for threat, but not so much so that I would ever recommend rerolling when you already have a 33 orc
---
The level 55 mage water is highest you will find. Other than that I believe you will only get the 2and best water from inn keepers
---
Can you provide a link?
---
If people are asking a question that you find dumb or basic, don't answer it and ignore it. 
---
If its something I can answer, I'll answer it. It doesn't affect me negatively in anyway.  
---
You taking the time to answer them, without an answer, wastes your time, his time, so why bother? Do you feel like you are enlightening them in some way?
---
Its also the most passive aggressive way to say "F You" to someone. If a coworker asked you, hey what time is it? and You said "Check a clock" instead of just telling them, wouldn't they be annoyed too?  Like, "hey what day of the week is Christmas this year?" "Go google it."  
---
Simple question, with a simple answer, and no need to post on the forums (in opposition to the other thread that was posted) saying that its acceptable to answer a question with "Go do it yourself," and then be surprised that people found it rude.
---
So to clarify:  a male consumer of soy is a wrong-talk nonoword that the benevolent mods have on auto remove to protect us? Even when directed at no particular individual?
---
For an Orc, DB + Flurry beats DB + Cht. Not sure why you would roll on corehound.
---
&gt;except maybe prevent players from creating characters on an unbalanced server, but considering how many people were part of a guild before the game even launched, it's not like every player even chose the server they play on, as their guild chose it for them.
---
I think they should have done that anyways, and since the servers were so chaotic at launch people would be able to create characters eventually anyways, due to the huge influx.
---
&gt;Is that really much better than having a few Alliance-dominated servers, having a few balanced servers and having a huge majority of Horde-dominated servers? At least there's variety...
---
I don't think it would be a problem if poorly balanced servers would just be rebranded to PvE, as at a current point it literally becomes unplayable for the current faction, and someone gets screwed over anyways.
---
&gt;I moved to Heartseeker around the time that census was published, when it was 54/46, thinking that was balanced enough. Had I known it would become ~75/~25, I wouldn't have picked it, obviously, but in the end, I'm glad to see we still have a bunch of Horde who are willing to wPvP and that they're even capable of holding their own for a while, at least until the cavalry rolls in.
---
Isn't that ruinous to your experience? And yeah, cross-realm BGs might reduce wpvp for some time (I think it will be more or less back to normal once people get AV exalted, which should be pretty fast).
---
And then you are stuck in the same shit situation, and you are getting fucked on your way to BRM, people are quitting. And then patch with the world dragons is released and Silithus becomes the new major zone where all the objectives are out in the open world.
---
How are you going to play there if there is 75% Alliance on your server?
---
I would have rerolled, that server seems irredeemable, or it should rebranded PvE so the smaller faction can actually play the game.
---
Contrary to popular belief, I think the complainers are the min/maxers and the HK farmers are just simply playing the game. Complaints come from people trying to quest/level solo, or group for a dungeon and travel there solo.. rather than take an alternative route or coordinate to move in groups or to grind on distant mobs - these people are just upset that Honor farmers are ruining their efficiency. You can still get to dungeons and you can still level - just not quite how you were before p2 dropped. You either learn and adapt or you mindless try over and over and over again and eventually end up here writing paragraphs about why the horde are tryhard tizmos and it's their fault. No sympathy anymore.
---
FER KHAZ MODAN !!!!
---
&gt; This behavior typically comes along with an ego running rampant with a desire for recognition and approval.
---
If someone wanted recognition like that, they'd sit around answering every question everyone had so people knew exactly how knowledgeable they were. This is the exact opposite of that.
---
You're wrong but it seems nothing will change your mind.  Also BS gaining threat requires the target to be on the mob's threat table and if you use it immediately after charging in you're the only person on the treat table.
---
What about current mana resource?  They have it in retail, but I can't seem to get it to display for classic logging.
---
You're horde. Play an alliance on a pvp server and then see if you still think the numbers are perfect.
---
If it can be cheesed it will be.
---
Youre literally "quoting"  thing I didnt even say and then arguing about it. Do you realise how stupid you sound?
---
I'm a warlock so I just logout as a ghost and hope they've stopped camping the graveyard long enough to hearth to Menethil (where I will promptly die as well.)
---
Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit is it?
---
Is it really so hard to just answer? You cant make humanity live the way you deem ideal or fit. It is what it is chief
---
There's also a group that played vanilla but never got 60 or didn't do dungeons then. Have a couple of friends who never hit above 40 or so and just had a ton of alts they slowly leveled.
---
I’m also the one that thought a balance Druid was viable in classics, when really it’s not anywhere near what I remember it being, and consequently rerolled
---
I agree with you in terms of raid loot distribution, but I would like to make it clear that priests cannot equip swords so no guild should EVER give their spriest mageblade lol.
---
Also, if a priest is holy spec and has the talent Spiritual Guidance (dmg and healing spells increased by 25% of your total spirit) the animated chain neck actually gives as much if not more +healing than the choker anyways, and would be BIS over the choker imo.
---
I know for a fact there is a weak aura that displays an ice barrier indicator. It’s a visual that you can move around and slowly depletes kinda like a health bar. It’s out there if you wanna search for it
---
Dungeons do have a minimum level requirement, I know that WC is level 10.
---
Yeah asking where to train healing skill isn’t based on opinion.
---
Trolls are the only race that have a racial ability to increase threat generation. While their regen does produce the tiniest bit of threat since it counts as a heal, it's a nonissue. Berserk is the reason to pick troll. Tanking in classic is all about threat generation first, mitigation second. The sooner you as a tank can establish threat on a target, the faster your dps can murder it.
---
Cool in theory until two guilds essentially decide they speak for the whole server. I flew over Azshara this morning and saw a lot of bitching about it. IMO it's fine to do this kinda shit if it's only 2 raid groups going for it, but the minute more show up you can't expect the others to play by rules they never agreed to.
---
The salt was so great I had to fly back to Azshara just to watch it fly through chat lol.
---
Is riding skill different cross race? If I have my epic riding skill as undead, can someone buy a kodo and trade it to me for my use?
---
Disagree.  Bwl pugs will happen but its more dependant on the dps knowledge and skill.  Bwl trash is much more difficult than mc trash, suppression room is the first time your afk rogues have to perform, drake cleaves, fap requirements.  Its much easier to find 3 competent tanks and a handful of healers than fielding 25 strong dps.
---
So there are no cooking recipes for it?
---
Yeah, this is correct. I phrased that poorly.
---
The DW penalty (19%) is disabled.
---
And imagine bragging about 70 parses at that.
---
You won't get anything better from cooking unfortunately.
---
Ukraine?
---
The problem is for hunters your leveling rotation looks not much like your boss rotation as you have to worry about threat more and mobs dont live long enough. + everyone levels BM and MM is the thing to be at 60. So you really have 0 practice at you raid rotation till 60.
---
Your paragraphs are too damn long but yeah give me as much classic as possible
---
The world dragons, honor system, and dire maul went live on a Thursday at 11am EST.

I can almost guarantee it'll be the same for bgs, so Thursday the 12th.

It's not really possible to program automod to know the difference between a directed slur and not. It's better if we just don't use any of them and be nice to eachother.

Happy to protect you! Have a nice day

Talk shit get hit!
---
Oh ok thank you
---
You are exactly right, after all we all have time to start a new server whenever, since my wow is my only purpose and I have absolutely no social obligations elsewhere. Clearly it wouldn't make sense for blizzard to offer paid server transfer. After all, we have no money but a buttload of time : )

This isnt just a classic thing. I remember TBC being as bad or worse than Vanilla wpvp.

If farming exp &amp; leather is a waste of time, then you are spot on.
---
So the paladin talent for 3% hit counts towards this?
---
The Horde would never discriminate against people because of their race or commit genocide!
---
With how visible so many bugs/exploits are now, I am positive blizz will fix this like how they fixed the rooftop camp spot in everlook.

He's called me shitty several times now, implied I'm not a decent human being, and has an irritated, passive-aggressive tone in a lot of what he says. Just read this post as if you were saying it out loud and tell me every bit of phrasing isn't that of someone who has tension in their voice.
---
&gt;Then don't respond to it. How is someone asking a question directed at a general audience lazy or disrespectful to you. Just ignore it. Just because you're not willing to help doesn't mean others aren't. Just because you see something doesn't mean you have to respond to it in a shitty manner, that's just you being a shitty person.

classic wow has multiple layers of verification that's why it lags
---
Troll warriors are the best tanks available if you’re intending to get thunderfury as a MT in terms of threat. Otherwise, I’d say Orc is superior for an off tank for stun resist and axe skill.
---
Try to get a fear off with brokentooth on you. (Spoiler: you can't)
---
Hunters deal a TON of damage, much more in a shorter space of time, than a warlock can. Also remember - warlocks wear cloth, they are INCREDIBLY squishy. Hunter multishots can be hitting you for over a thousand damage, that's a significant amount when you have only a few thousand life. If you don't have a voidwalker out for sacrifice, you're pretty much doomed. For most warlocks in the open world, you don't have a voidwalker out, you have a felhunter as it is better against more classes.
---
Also most warlocks who are going to be pvping are going not be destruction, so bursting out a hunter isn't going to happen, you have to slowly dot them out, while they are sitting at longer range than you, pelting you with harder hitting shots.
---
So like I said, you have far more survivability, as a druid because if you are losing, you can get reset the fight or just go somewhere else. Warlock you just die.

Everything I dont like is hate speech
---
PK vs. PvP is an important distinction. And PKing in UO was basically the same as it is in WOW, roaming gankers murdering noobs or outnumbering on-level players. Key difference in UO is there was the risk of stat loss from PKing.
---
Range indicator comes with DBM, no?  You type in /range 8 for Rag or something and it shows a diagram that gets angry when someone is too close to you.
---
Personally, I like playing without quest mods, and I ask other players for help if I get stuck. If they don't want to help, they don't have to. They can just ignore me, and I'll eventually figure it out myself.
---
Crowdsourcing information and helping others is part of the MMO experience. It's satisfying to use your knowledge to help a guildie with a quest.
---
Sure, I could exit the game and google it, but that's cheating and detracts from the experience.
---
I’ve been hesitant to do this quest because of this.
---
I inconvenienced a botter. That's worth it to me.
---
(Although getting the decent XP, all the loot, and all the skins helps too!)
---
I appreciate the time you've taken to explain it.  I don't fully agree with your point of view but I do better understand where you are coming from.
---
If you stand on the absolute edge it wont matter.
---
There’s literally a button on your keyboard made to take pictures.
---
I likely will but 1 parry and 2 ap over hoj proc and 20 ap
---
Rogue for sure.
---
Where's your proof of this divine intention?
---
I run around high level zones mining and herbing and partaking in the occasional pvp battle, I made rank 5 just fighting people for resources never joined a raid or gank squad. 
---
I was going to drop herbalism for engineering but I pass by so many herbs while mining I can't bring myself to do it.
---
Sometimes if there's too many people online or in a certain zone I'll just park myself by the coast and fish. 
---
Nothing special here but I have 1k gold cash and several hundred gold invested in various mats/potions.
---
there are gonna have long queues even with cross realm bgs lol
---
And parry worthless for me
---
This entire thread is the masturbatory fantasy of spurned allies.  If anyone here believes for a single second that this could somehow benefit a minority faction more than it hurts them they are beyond delusional.
---
By all means though, continue cranking one out and shoot your load all over the beehive.   Pretending that these did give DK's you can guarantee that whatever atrocities you experienced that led you to feel like you needed the nuclear option will be retaliated against in a vastly disproportional way.
---
lol, did I tell him he can or cannot be a traitor? Of coarse he can do what ever he wants with his money. I'm just letting him know he is a traitor and he is making the problem worse.
---
You really think phase 6 is going to be less than 1.5 years away? ok lol.
---
[Well, this definitely was at least.](https://i.imgur.com/2IzY7iz.png)

&gt; Plus the stopwatch.
---
I vendored it because I needed money. Now at 60 I miss this item the most, feelsbadman.
---
I’m so glad you agree with my flawless logic ☺️
---
I played hunter from all of vanilla-WotLK. I was never able to kill warlocks as a hunter. I’m not the dude you’re arguing against, idc about your Druid discussion.  
---
Ask around, hunters get fucked by locks.
---
It's funny how you're acting like hes acting like hes wasting his time when it was actually a neat, unexpected anecdote and the only one who is wasting there time is you lol.
---
Let me elaborate this. The 1% is an EXTRA percent when the difference between wep skill and defense is more than ten. From 301 to 305 you win 0.4% for each weapon skill. From 306 and up you gain 0.1%  
---
Wep skill vs. defense: Hit cap  
---
300 vs. 315: 9%  
---
301 vs. 315: 8.6%   (-0.4%)

303 vs. 315: 7.8%   (-0.4%)

304 vs. 315: 7.4%   (-0.4%)  
---
305 vs. 315: 6%   (-0.4%) (also remove the extra percent)  
---
306 vs. 315: 5.9% (-0.1%)  
---
307 vs. 315: 5.8% (-0.1%)  
---
308 vs. 315: 5.7% (-0.1%)  
---
309 vs. 315: 5.6% (-0.1%)  
---
310 vs. 315: 5.5% (-0.1%)  
---
311 vs. 315: 5.4% (-0.1%)  
---
312 vs. 315: 5.3% (-0.1%)  
---
313 vs. 315: 5.2% (-0.1%)  
---
314 vs. 315: 5.1% (-0.1%)  
---
315 vs. 315: 5.0% (-0.1%)
---
I don’t blame you. I’d do the same thing given the opportunity xD
---
But then you have to take an extra minute to crop the picture and who honestly has time for that?
---
You say you like pvp but then make a post complaining about pvp.
---
Let me elaborate this. The 1% is an EXTRA percent when the difference between wep skill and defense is more than ten. From 301 to 305 you win 0.4% for each weapon skill. From 306 and up you gain 0.1%

Play whatever the fuck you want. Don't feed into the min/max bullshit.
---
Then the patrol must not have been up. The patrol 100% kills him, if he dies to the patrol you fail even if he dies at the tower. He can solo everything but the patrol of 5 scarlet mobs.
---
It's vanilla. Play whatever you want, it all works well enough. Everyone mentions best for x when it's vanilla and not retail
---
found the issue
---
Oh how wrong it’s going to go for him...
---
Someone told OP the screenshot button was Alt + F4, so now he just uses his phone.
---
Not what I expected when I read the title and the first sentence lol. I'm happy you caught on to what was going on and found a way to swing it to your advantage.
---
Are you on Smolderweb?
---
“Play how you want, UNLESS you want to min/max.”
---
See the irony there?
---
As a shadow priest I love grinding on rogues
---
Good PvP players select Horde because of much better PvP racials.  
---
When Alliance got better passives in WotLK - they switched to Alliance)  
---
But I'm speaking about average players, that create majority of server population.  
---
You should ask them, because I don't know answer to your question.
---
??? 
---
1. You don’t have to crop anything. You can select exactly what you want copied. 
---
2. OP had to edit out the names anyways. 
---
Who has time to get off their computer to take a picture of their screen? 
---
That’s like getting out of your car because you want to run the next 10 miles.
---
You aren't taking into account all of the things you mentioned, lips, and every other consumable.  Mages can use them too.  All CD's up for both classes and rogue is slightly favored maybe like 40/60 at equal skill.  Any CD's down for rogue and mage wins like 90/10 at equal skill.
---
Mage shits on hunters other than BM.
---
There is a screenshot on the curse addon page. link in OP.
---
This is good content. Mods sticky plz
---
Who is speaking about adapting or not?  
---
But you could start with admitting that Horde players are more aggressive from the start. :)
---
I'm a rouge, all my friends are rouges. It's the only way to stay alive in STV. Group stealth questing is fun.
---
I’d add a thanks too. It helped a lot. I was also confused
---
You’re just stuck on this manichean idea that anyone not being ganked  relentlessly and quitting the game is happy... so yeah if you define being unhappy like this ok. If you add a bit of nuance and add to the people leaving the game, those who only raid log because they don’t like the state of the game, the horde players not liking how classic PvP has developed and all the ‘casuals’ who are frustrated to get ganked by hardcore players to the category ‘unhappy with phase 2’ then you have a majority.
---
And sorry but it’s ridiculous to think that if a post about how alliance are quitting is upvoted with a 92% ratio, it’s only a minority brigading. Like I said I’m not saying stats on this sub are ultimate truth but you cannot ignore it and say it he large majority doesn’t care. If there was that much of a divide, you’d see those post on top of controversial
---
Thanks! lol Just got Humar just for aesthetics with my black tiger

Minding my own business - surely no snake will ever reach up from this commode &amp; bite my sensitive areas.
---
With trinket the matchup is more even than phase 1.
---
My guild tries to help everyone but someone complaining and saying they might leave deserves a swift gkick for being so needy and threatening to leave to guilt people looks bad
---
Incredible, an honorable duel in the circle of shields, between two named men, a sacred tradition. Only one may come out victorious, while the other goes back to the mud. The Great Leveler is a dark shadow that looms over us all, in the ring.
---
I use Threat Plates and Details Tiny Threat. I don’t like the default Tiny Threat look, but there is an option to use class colors that I turned on and like it much more. 
---
As far as I’m aware, Classic Threat Meter and Details share info with each other so as long as your party members have one or the other it should be fine. I haven’t tested this though. 
---
Threat Plates works differently than these I think but not sure. I like the color changing nameplate.
---
Is there some legal way to buy gold with cash that I'm not aware of? It can't be pay to win if there's no way to pay.  
---
I don't think it was ever a competition of who could play better, more a competition of who has more time to play.
---
Green healing bracers and wand are pre-bis.
---
Haha that gosh darn programming!! I understand how that could definitely be a little tough to program! Given that difficulty in programming, heh, that pesky programming, I really appreciate the completely ban that one soy-based “””””””””””””””””””””””slur””””””””””””””””””””” since we wouldn’t want someone to be the victim of a soy-based
---
“””””””””””””””””””””””slur”””””””””””””””””””””
---
By the way, are “mud-hut” / “no-shoes” hordies on auto remove too? It’s better to just be nice to each other ya know and I’m really needing some protection from slurs btw
---
Uhhhhh what? I think you either misremember or are misinformed on rogues
---
Let me see if I get this right: after losing, the members of PWW tried to keep other horde guilds from getting the boss since they lost to the alliance guild? I’m not sure how I feel about that. On one hand, PWW was trying to uphold their end of the bargain. On the other hand, they could have just left and let the other non-agreement-bound horde guilds do as they please (after all, why should they turn down loot because an unaffiliated guy lost a 1v1?). Pretty interesting! I wish I raided last night, I completely zoned out ‘cause I wasn’t feeling well and forgot to even log on.
---
&gt; I don't think it would be a problem if poorly balanced servers would just be rebranded to PvE,
---
I'd delete my toons right away, but yeah, that'd be no problem... Seriously, do you even read what you write?
---
&gt; as at a current point it literally becomes unplayable for the current faction,
---
As I've said before, Horde on Heartseeker are capable of holding their ground (for a time), so I'm not sure I agree with your definition of "unplayable", whatever it is...?
---
&gt; and someone gets screwed over anyways.
---
So your solution is to screw over as many people as possible, instead of as little as possible? Ok...
---
&gt; Isn't that ruinous to your experience?
---
&gt; And yeah, cross-realm BGs might reduce wpvp for some time
---
Not really, well, maybe on Alliance-dominated servers, since Alliance will mostly get insta-queues, but as far as Horde-dominated and balanced servers are concerned, it will only mean even less PvP-able Allys running around to fight back the Horde...
---
&gt; And then you are stuck in the same shit situation, and you are getting fucked on your way to BRM, people are quitting.
---
Last 2 weeks, I never managed to get inside Dire Maul without having to die 5+ times and corpse-running there, and then having to wait for the rest of my group to endure the same process. That is on a server where my faction is the dominant one.
---
First thing first, I'm not quitting over getting killed in a PvP game, why the fuck would I even play a PvP game if I'd quit over dying?! That said, we all knew that a fair share of the players would quit sooner or later, for whatever reason. Faction/server balance is just one of those reasons, but it's not like servers were better balanced 15 years ago...
---
&gt; And then patch with the world dragons is released and Silithus becomes the new major zone where all the objectives are out in the open world.
---
I can't wait for that.
---
&gt; How are you going to play there if there is 75% Alliance on your server?
---
Same way everyone else will, I'll log in, pick my character and push buttons...
---
&gt; I would have rerolled, that server seems irredeemable, or it should rebranded PvE so the smaller faction can actually play the game.
---
They already can.
---
Again, what is your definition of "unplayable"?
---
A few things strike me in our discussion.
---
First, you seem to be the kind of person who likes to see the glass half-empty. Sure, there are many disadvantages at playing on an unbalanced server, but there are also advantages. Some people actually like playing conditions which you deem "unplayable".
---
Second, every suggestions you've made would make things worse.
---
Finally, Warcraft (even before WoW) has always been a fight between Humans and the Alliance and Orcs and the Horde. As far as I'm concerned, that is not a fight that could last forever and I simply consider faction-dominated servers to be incarnations of Azeroth where that faction is winning that war.
---
In the end, that doesn't make the game literally unplayable for anyone. You can level in instances and PvP in BGs if you feel like the world is figuratively "unplayable", so the game is still playable, no matter the server/faction you play.
---
Do you guys have any Warrior grinding spots for Lvl 50/51?
---
Preferably Lvl 48-49 mobs, I am a Warrior afterall
---
Good shit.
---
Vaguely defined hate speech is the tyrant's wet dream - be it a forum mod or politician. Absolute carte blanche to silence all dissent with no social repercussion
---
??? The tweet literally says it'll be the 10th, why would it come on the 12th
---
Riding most definitely does not cost 720g....
---
You don't do anything in retail to "get ready for the next expansion" btw. Quite the opposite actually since every single patch is basically a hard reset on all progression
---
You want tactical mastery for stance dancing. For example when tanking you can charge in with battle stance, switch to defensive and have enough rage to put a sunder on multiple targets. A target is escaping and running towards the healer? Dance to berserker, intercept, back to defensive and taunt it away. There is a lot you can do and any warrior should have a solid understanding of what each stance can bring to the table. For instance. Berserker and defensive both have a spell caster interupt. A warrior with a solid grasp of all his/her abilities is very well equipped in both pvp and pve. And as mentioned watch skarmtank.
---
To beat the que boss?
---
Its evidently more obscure than the "new entrance" to the SW AH....
---
I do the same in Alterac Mountains.  Always hunters there.  I kill the pet, aggro them on me, lead them to to mobs and report lol
---
I think the hunter bow quest, but that is just a shot in the dark
---
Only the first mark turn in I thought?
---
This is actually one of the reasons why my wife and I stopped playing retail a year ago.
---
We had started BFA and were having a really great time leveling, and while we were leveling we helped some of our guildies with their instance quests.
---
Once we hit max, we really started hitting heroic and mythics as hard as we could, bringing anyone that had the gear so that they could come as well.
---
Well, the players that hadn’t leveled as fast as we had started treating us like complete and total garbage because we weren’t running them through normals.   It was so bad that it completely destroyed how we get about the game but we stuck with it.
---
A few months down the line our MT was pushing m+ as far as he could in pugs and they started treating him like garbage because he wasn’t helping the guild.
---
These people felt entitled to our game time, and when we didn’t do what they wanted it became this huge drama mess that built and grew into other issues until my wife and I decided to say fuck it and quit.
---
It sucks, a lot.  We both put a ton of effort into that guild, I was RL for years - and built the raid team from a group that would have to pug to meet instance minimums, to a raid team that fielded 20-25 people and completed all raid achievements while raids were current.
---
We didn’t start playing Classic until thanksgiving week, and I don’t think we’ll ever guild/raid again.
---
I miss the good people from that guild,  but I HATE the ones that ruined the game for us.  We had been playing since vanilla, and that group fucked it up for us so hard with their shitty behavior.
---
Anyhow
---
/rant.
---
I think he means it greys out the people beyond 40 yards. It's really useful as a healer to be able to tell who is out of range before attempting to cast a heal.
---
What even is your point of view? 
---
That Warriors should only ever wear plate because they can wear plate?
---
That everyone should roll on everything if it is an upgrade for them? But, weren't you just complaining about losing Tooth of Gnarr?
---
That hunters should use a rare trinket because it dropped for them, even though they can do a 5 minute quest and replace it?
---
What philosophy of loot do you even have?
---
Like others have said, once you get past 5% you’re good to go. Dual wielding has a very high miss chance on auto-attacks that is too difficult to itemize into irrelevance (like14% hit) without severely gimping more useful stats.
---
At 5% all your special attacks won’t get avoided, so that’s what you aim for.
---
yes how did you know?
---
I'm going by what I have been seeing in the open world at this time. We have our hunters who literally 3-shot warlocks, and our warlock whose pet explodes in half a second and then his health tanks seconds later when engaging a hunter.
---
I think the XP you get is based off the amount of damage you do to the target, so not really..
---
You do you, boo. I'm would hope that you don't participate in the low-life griefing, and it's not a surprise that you are against that sort of behavior, coming from the Alliance. So I do applaud you for that. But you're still a traitor and I'm sorry that it has to be like this. But I have no sympathy for those that want to switch sides so they can have more fun. You are just making the problem worse for the rest of us. My /spit still stands.
---
Thanks for being understanding. Hopefully you can find Jesus in your life and be nicer to other people. Especially now when its christmas time and all! There is no need to be mean to people. Not everyone will take it well and some words do actually hurt.
---
Thanks for understanding your need of protection. Few do.
---
Have a nice day and happy hollidays my friend :)
---
Ah I forgot about that, bad example.
---
There is a line between getting help and being carried. There is a portion of the player base that acts like a guild exists for them alone. Dunno if streamers have perpetuated this or what. 
---
I have done a lot of dungeons that I don’t need as a tank for our community. I am way more inclined to help a guildy that has put in some effort “I made a group. We just need a tank” “I picked up all the quests for Gnomer but no one wants to run with a Ret Paladin...” I am less inclined to help “you should run me through SM Armory till I get all the drops”
---
Keybind your consumables, man!
---
I counted 5 pulls
---
Wtf is wrong with you? Nothing wrong with this post??? DOD you remove it so the repost could do better? Seriously the other mods need to remove you.
---
Why did you roll on that...
---
DB + flurry is more damage than CHT. Jesus..
---
Some things are objective, like the location of the healing trainer.
---
ICC was amazing, but by far my favorite raid in WoW history was Kara. What a great raid. Something different every time.
---
but they're aliens
---
No, you slowed down the bot slightly for a small fraction of time.  The botter probably won't even recognize you did this.
---
Is any of that relevant to the current topic though? No? Ok then stop changing the subject. You brought it up then got mad about it.
---
Probably a ret paladin, play Human so you get the bonus to swords.  
---
Or a prot paladin.
---
Those lesser guilds in vanilla were doing like 10 fold less DPS though. Nothing about BWL will be challenging TBH.
---
It doesn’t show up on the Front Page for me, but I can still comment on it as if it wasn’t locked/removed.
---
Pretty sure corehound offhand with either gutgore or perdition's mainhand with the combat dagger spec significantly beats dal rends swords. Corehound and perdition's are also amazing for tank warriors. 
---
As a hunter main, the idea of giving corehound, brutality blade, or either of the non rhok ranged weapons to any hunter before every melee that could use them has one seems ridiculous.
---
not a very high or a guardian
---
We had different experiences then somehow with the same resources...i googled BRD and got a very clear understanding from wowhead on the major aspects of the bar encounter.  It's why I never came here to ask questions about it.
---
I'm always happy to help people who have helped themselves...but when someone just says "does anyone have a guide for X" and i know the guide exists, I'm significantly less understanding than when someone says "I've looked up X and the guide wasn't helpful...how do you handle Y?"
---
I fell for it too...
---
I'm lvl 57 now and have spent more than 200 gold on vendor water (no friends playing, felt weird to ask Mages).
---
A Warlock coaxed me in to just asking Mages in main cities and giving them a tip, it has done wonders for my finances.
---
Blue Recluse should have free level 1 water that has flavor text:  "Quenches your thirst."
---
You can put a Dense Sharpening Stone (+8 damage) on a Flurry Axe but you can't put an Elemental Sharpening Stone (+2% crit) because its ilevel is too low. So, Deathbringer (WF or +2% crit)/Deathbringer (+2% crit) &gt; Deathbrginer (WF or +2% crit)/Flurry Axe (+8 damage).
---
Can you point me in the direction of a different wow forum?
---
I did it first try and it bugged out and wouldn’t complete. Now I dread going back.
---
&gt;Some people actually like playing conditions which you deem "unplayable".
---
massochists.
---
&gt;Second, every suggestions you've made would make things worse.
---
I am not so sure about that, it depends on your perspective.
---
On one side, the camping would definitely continue (which I think will do anyways after initial BG hype), another side is that people might reroll or they might quit (but again, thats already happening to lots of people on shit servers). 
---
But overall, I think would be a good thing in the long term, as people would balance out the servers more evenly, and there would be another advantage to playing alliance in most situations. Yeah, they will probably already have shorter queues, but with server wide BGs they would also have better gear from BG rep.
---
I also think it was a very distinct feature about vanilla, where you actually played vs the same people in BG as you were fighting out in the world,  it enhances the server community.
---
And yes, we can argue semantics over "unplayable", but when AQ/Silithus content and world bosses will basically be impossible for your entire faction, I would consider that "unplayable" and punishing in just the same manner as horde having less access to BGs.
---
For the ratio, I wouldn't play on anything below 40/60, in my eyes those servers are a waste of time. But if some people enjoy 25/75 and are stubborn about it, I guess you could keep being slaughtered.
---
The rebranding to PvE was mostly a call of mercy, but if some people like it they should be allowed to.
---
I am so sorry you've experienced that...that's just dumb toxic behavior.  Ironically, those same people will cry about the lack of tanks in the endgame dungeons.
---
What about the mage do you find boring? It will help to recommend classes
---
I was heavily downvoted for suggesting that there was even a hint of a possibility that AV gets released before the feast of winter veil so that we could have the version where you get to punt people off the bridge with hard-packed snowballs without having to wait a year.
---
Called it.
---
thorium ammo for hunters, as well as a couple stacks of it needed in various endgame recipes
---
Exactly!!! I didn’t quite catch whether you have mudhut or no-shoes horde on automod though, think you could quickly clarify that for me? Thanks in advance for answering that question in all your kindness :))
---
Why take anything when you can take fury warrior.
---
I’m just waiting for AV. There’s a quiver you can buy at revered that has same attack speed bonus as Sinew Bow but just 2 less slots for ammo. I never let myself run that low so even if I ever did get a blue sinew, I’d still sell it.
---
Most of the Mages in the main cities were 60 and decked out.
---
Me:        "You downed Rag with X guild in Molten Core?"
---
Mage:   "Yeah, had to go Frost for it."
---
Me.        "Can I have some water?"
---
Edit:  Now I just say, "Can you make 5 stacks of 55 for 2g?"
---
::instantly becomes nervous of what my posting history may contain::
---
Seriously though, thank you for saying that. I've actually met somebody recently who has been a huge help. Meeting them, plus some good therapy sessions, have gotten me to a better place mentally. Still a struggle, but doable!
---
No reason to have tailoring until phase 4, when you'll need it for the Bloodvine set bonus. Until then, mooncloth and the convenience of crafting bags for alts is about it.
---
Sadly, this seems to be the general consensus as far as I am capable of gauging it. Alongside a notable minority who are ok with what is happening because they either think it should be this way or have some odd notion that the people suffering deserve it for lack of foresight. It's mildly scary how quickly I've seen 'they could of seen this coming' turn into 'they should suffer' in some of these reddit comments...
---
 [Here is a list of dungeons and their minimum level requirements](https://progameguides.com/wow/wow-classic-dungeon-levels/)
---
When you draw it that way I wonder if you shouldn't just get the Key to the Searing Gorge and go to Loch Modan.
---
Keep in mind right now you can mana burn druids while they are shapeshifted.
---
So i walk into IronForge and I just start pyro blastin
---
Wait really? My bad, someone told me they weren't getting full xp when I was helping them kill mobs while out of their group. Weird
---
Isn’t there a quest at very low level where you do in fact get a free drink?
---
The longer you play on that server the less likely the odds are that you’ll never see them again. This isn’t retail where LFD puts you with new randoms every time. You may actually need to group with that guy again (what tank shortage right?) or, hell, you may need to group with someone on his friends list or guild at some point. Your reputation matters on Classic servers. You can play the “your gear is wholly immaterial to me” game, but we are in month 3 of what could be your home server for the next few years if you play long enough.
---
if they had went through with the original plan to link IF and Darn through the tram (hense the underwater section), darn would be far more populated
---
classic + please
---
I remember when I had my first beer.
---
Click off and create some distance.
---
Berserk is very good for getting threat since your endgame weapon is Thunderfury anyway so orc racial doesn't matter.
---
Play disc as a support. Go shadow if you wanna 1v1 people.
---
But you're honorless
---
You are right that my in-game gains would be greater if I allowed him to live. However, my desire to punish somebody for cheating outweighs my sane wishes, ha!
---
Fucking loser lol
---
I can confirm. My roomie has deleted and restored 1 item each month since release. Blizzard is pretty lenient as long as you didn’t delete the item too long ago.
---
&gt; Probably missing mortgage payments on his tree while his wife is banging a satyr.
---

---
Oh, they could monetize Classic, but the backlash would tank the game. I was sure they'd sell the Vanilla Collector Editions, and possible early-years Blizzcon non-combat pets.
---
I don't think they could get away with re-selling past expansions. - "I already bought TBC once, why do I have to buy it again!?"
---
And it won't be more profitable to focus on Classic. No way. Not unless the cash shop gets enabled (Classic uses the BFA client; the cash shop is there, just turned off).
---
...That Dottie...ya that'll probably net them around $4 million. Of which they'll donate a mere $2 million to charity. Mounts and Battle Pets are literally money printers. And that Dottie, looks like it's just the Alpaca mount, but scaled down, so next to zero development time went into it.
---
Sure, subs are nice...steady income. But hot damn, those cash shop items make them millions in an hour or so.
---
Classic is just here to stem the hemorrhaging sub count. That's the only reason it was announced. They had since TBC to do this. But waited until the second worst received expansion, with subs estimated around 2 million (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/acqhph/i_estimated_subscriber_numbers_using_google_trend/), to finally do it.
---
Razorgore wasn't stopping the scrubbiest guilds back then and it won't stop the scrubbiest pugs today. Broodlord would have been the same way had Vael not been between them. Increased DPS shortens the fight and gives you a ton of leeway. In Razorgore it means not getting overwhelmed by adds, in Broodlord it means dealing with less knockbacks. Seriously, there's not a lot of coordination in any of these fights and I think we are greatly underestimating the playerbase.
---
Both blind and gouge break on damage so if they are getting the full duration you should be able to stealth unless you are like right on top of them when the CC breaks.
---
Dont click off the target. As a rogue you will lose all combo points on your target. Using blind/gouge will stop your auto attacks automatically.
---
It’s not wrong in the sense that it’s very common for people to approach games that way. It is wrong in that sense that no one should be shit on because they didn’t want to do homework to play a video game. I say that as someone who loves to do the research when I’m away and can’t play.
---
Yeah but you cant sit around in Ironforge and 1 shot people all day.
---
Some people played Horde in Vanilla and wanted a different experience  
---
Alliance have (arguably) better PvE racials so they're better for raid progression  
---
Alliance starting zones are amazing and the early leveling in Goldshire is probably the best  
---
Easy access to moonwells  
---
Night elves are the only race than flip
---
It also depends on the server at the time. Some of the largest servers of each region had many many layers. By the end of the second or third month, blizzard had been cutting back on the layer count quite a bit. Where the less populated servers never had more than 5 layers for very long.
---
I can't believe he's fucking dead.
---
This needs more up votes
---
Whats  with the gnome hate i always see around here? Is it just a meme at this point? Or do people actually just hate players that roll gnome? It reminds me of the dumb people who say blanket  shit like "all alliance are like this" or "all horde are like that." I thought people were just saying that stuff for the meme too until i asked about it and got responses like "no seriously horde are all griefer assholes you should see them on yadayada server" as if alliance doesnt grief at all. Sorry for rant.. but genuinely curious
---
I've been melee since 2005 and never have played or studied caster gear. How does the "increases healing and damage done by spells by X" calculate? Is it just a straight up addition to the base numbers that the spell lists?
---
It’s BiS for healing MS. Any guild that restricts it to DPS is not being reasonable, they’re minmaxing.
---
&gt; Reasonable guilds let any caster that wants it spend the DKP they earned on it, with the caveat that it’s better for DPS.
---
Only wow players would label this nsfw
---
Theres nothing greedy about a very geared player who's repair bills are outrageous offering you a service in exchange for goods.
---
There is the nightfin for more mana regeneration, for 10 instead of 15 minutes. But you wont be able to find anything better for flat mana restore besides the argent dawn biscuits as far as I know.
---
I am uninterested in doing so.
---
Is bloodvine bind on equip? Can I just have a guildie make it? Thanks for the response.
---
What would a better profession choice be at endgame level? My other one is tailoring which I'm keeping for mooncloth.
---
It is disheartening though when you get feared and run the wrong direction.  But we must get back up and try try again.
---
Where is the data that shows longer queues cause factions to balance out? I played a lot during vanilla and queues sucked. I was even on an alliance dominated server as a horde player(PVP Realm, Azgalor). 
---
We have servers that are substantially larger than previously, but we still have some low population realms(BR realms as an example have very small populations). 
---
Your solution doesn't take into account any lower population realms and the seriously negative impact this has on them. So many people have said this isn't the solution, why are you constantly beating a drum and saying "YES IT IS!!!!". There may be a good alternate solution, but this isn't it.
---
&gt; druids suck vs any melee class... druids suck in general at pvp..Yeah totally druids can survive the open world with stealth and running
---
You are kidding right? I wish I was running OBS earlier where I literally 1v2ed 2 dagger rogues with perdition blades in Ironforge. Melees get dumpstered by druids because druids can not only outlast them, they can also TANK their damage in bearform. It's also very easy for druids who are specced well to be able to peel melees (nature's grasp, bash, tidal charm, engineering net, etc.) If a melee FAP's you can just catdash to outrange them until it wears off then be able to root/stun them to reset or just heal up. Also note: rogues cannot reset against druids easily due to faerie fire, they have to purification potion to drop it and that will make them lose access to FAP for 2 minutes.
---
**EDIT**: Sitenote: there's a reason why druids are **THE** flag carrier for WSG, they survive the best and have the mobility.
---
Only for the bloodvine set combo, but that's when ZG gets released and likely to be months away.
---
There has been a lot of discussion around the hit rating soft cap that is worth having a read of as ot changes pre raid BiS and how spec.
---
Or when you fear them and your auto attack breaks it.
---
I wonder if they genuinely planned on doing it like normal and ended up just saying “fuck it, the 10th for everyone”
---
DPS warrior is one of the best DPS from MC to naxx. 
---
Warlock PvE: mediocre early, great after ZG. 
---
Warlock PvP: always strong
---
Healing is pretty easy and dull in general imo.
---
Druid is ok at everything, not great at anything. Highest skill cap for PvP.
---
Hunter PvE: strong early, weaker compared to other classes later in the game.
---
Hunter PvP: very strong
---
Rogue PvE: easy and boring 
---
Rogue PvP: very fun
---
Literally anyone can load up their bags with consumables.
---
I should get Enchantrix then.
---
Oh yeah its so much better in terms of layout and aesthetics. But it lacks Ony buff, and zep to UC/EK. If zep was there for whatever reason I would go to TB way more often. Hearth has been gromgol for a while and that's worked really well for me.
---
Druid is very versatile. You can carry around different gear and switch from DPS to tank to healer depending on the situation. I've been having a blast so far.
---
Tier has a ton of stam on it, but you gotta be raiding and OG said he "couldn't" for whatever reason.
---
Floats like a butterfly,
---
stings like a bee,
---
Hits like a truck,
---
Drops like a tree.
---
Hello all! What's the optimal levelling build/spec for warlock on a PVE realm? Thanks!
---
It wasn’t a screen grab of some wow scenery with a sunset, it’s of two text chat boxes. Your applying your own morality of screen shots and expect everyone to cater to your needs. Let’s do it together, let’s build that bridge and you can finally get over it.
---
somehow there's still people out there who don't know what alt+F4 does
---
Because the game is 15 years old and has been played by 10's of millions of people.  Chances are you are one of them.
---
... yeah cause they 1v1 as a flag carrier. you are so out to lunch its fuckin funny..
---
druids suck at pvp sorry bud. yeah they can run and hide I like how you think that means they are good at 1v1. good luck bud
---
Maybe the problem is the warlock you’re observing
---
It’s beautiful when a timocracy comes together!
---
This list is the recommended minimums to actually do the dungeon, sounds like OP is asking how early he can have people run him through them specifically to farm twink gear. 
---
I have never seen a list, but it's probably around 10 or 11 for Deadmines and WC. I got my Priest twink in Deadmines starting around lvl 14, but then I saw someone lower than that in there so who knows.
---
Paladins are just better than shamans in both pvp and pve.
---
Will your friends run ZF or Mara? Hard to believe that your server is so cramped that you cant level open world, and at the same time everyone else 40-52 is doing it well enough they dont see the need to dungeon.
---
Christ I hope you don't have kids. "Just Google it Timmy I don't have time for your laziness"
---
Ayyy congrats on the bow! Hoping to get the leaf drop this week.
---
RIP Flamelash...guess I'm moving too...
---
If I'm being honest, I'd rather see them just release BC/Wrath progression after Vanilla. I think there is a lot of potential in the form of new vanilla content, but I do not trust blizzard. I'm not saying they couldn't do an amazing job, I'm just saying from their recent history with choosing corporate over fanbase, its more likely they could ruin it.
---
TBC and Wrath were both awesome expansions. I'd love to revisit them again. Why fix something if it's not broke is what resonates with me here.
---
didn't they fix that so that the snowballs melt after so long and if you load
---
all the people trying to run markets on the AH without understanding how to do it, or not knowledgeable about the market flow of the items they decide to run on. you can make a lot of money from idiots trying to raise prices on goods
---
I know Im going to be rude but stupidity of your comment is just ridiculous. So you call asking for one sphere greedy. Ok. In this case what is spending of 30 minutes looking for tank just because of 1/5 of sphere? Think about it.
---
Agreed, a little more about you, what you like to do/want to do would help.
---
It's an amazing tanking weapon. The pieces are in Molten Core.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=19019](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19019)
---
well yea u gotta think what kinda loser would moderate subs for free...power trippers 99% of the time
---
Yeah - what I worry about sometimes is having a clique of people who have been around a little longer but it’s kind of natural that people who have been together for a while will have established relationships and as long as you are not excluding others, it should be a non issue
---
For example, I only joined this guild a month ago but am getting to know people better, running dungeons, forming bonds, etc
---
&gt;Is DPS warrior viable?
---
Warrior leveling is arguably one of the hardest, your lack of CC/heals/utility means you basically range/face pull everything and hope that you don't pull an extra mob.  
---
But leveling as fury/arms is fine, you don't need to be prot to tank until endgame raidign.
---
&gt;I never played a healer before, is priest/shaman healing difficult?
---
It's like playing whack-a-mole with health bars. It's not hard, but if you lose concentration for a few seconds it can cause the group to wipe.
---
&gt;Same with druid and hunter
---
I'm leveling a Druid at the moment and having a blast, they have tons of utility, they can tank/heal/dps, and they get travel form making questing a lot easier.
---
Hunters are great too, but you'll have to deal with ammo issues and feeding your pet a lot.
---
&gt;I dont know about rolling a rogue. is it any fun?
---
I leveled a rogue in Vanilla, it was fine because you only need HP to keep going so bandages basically meant you had a lot of uptime. Sap meant that you could handle some of the bigger encounters and being able to stealth around made some harder quests almost trivial.
---
Not you. And yes I admit horde players are more aggressive. 
---
Who’s TALKING about adapting or not? No one. But people aren’t creating pvp whine threads just to showcase their woes, it’s a cry for people to change how they’re playing to better suit those whining. That’s the goal right? Or is it just whining to whine? You pick. Both options are pathetic.
---
&gt; and expect everyone to cater to your needs
---
cater to my needs? Of using technology properly? Am I out of line for telling someone to use a button?
---
The fact youre getting upset at ME for telling people about a FASTER and BETTER QUALITY way to take pictures is kinda confusing and I dont get where its coming from.,
---
I'd much rather every rogue topping charts and making fights comically easy than help tanks get a bit more threat. We clear MC in under an hour largely due to 4 daggers rogues with perds. They top every fight and no threat issues.
---
I believe it requires 300 tailoring
---
Cuz I was giving it to my best friend.  Who will run it with me until I get mine.
---
Back in TBC, we had a guild member ask for help with shortcuts...
---
He asked why was it when he did shourtcuts for alt+f1, alt-f2, alt-f3 it was working fine, but when he tried alt-f4 his game crashed...
---
Someone just said it works fine for him and told him to try it again..
---
When we saw the notification that he went offline we all died inside...
---
It was funny as fuck..
---
Observing warlocks on both sides, and there's also the Classic WoW duel tournament where the top warlock went 2-1 against a hunter. (I wouldn't call that a super hard counter, it seems rather close)
---
Keep asking the guild to run dungeons with you, emphasize that you'd like to hit 60 so you can help with endgame content. If nobody is ever willing to help, it might be time to shop for a new guild unless you're super set on this one. Also as a mage i've read in a post on the forums that even at your level you can solo the zf gy for good xp and gold. I'm not a mage tho so I cannot confirm nor deny that the poster was truthful, but that might be the grind you're looking for. Best of luck!
---
The ToS image you posted is from 2012...
---
The items themselves are not, but the set bonus (+2% spell crit) requires 300 tailoring.
---
The main point is that in PVP crusader has a ton of wasted uptime. You can't guarantee sticking to a target for the full duration, you dont always need the full duration to kill them, if it procs at the end of the fight it isn't as useful.
---
I didn't see what the mage had prior to the roll, so I can't say if it was an upgrade for him.  Considering that he was doing well in the UBRS group and was 60 to my 58, I assumed he had better.  If it was a legit upgrade for the stamina and int, then I'm fine with him rolling on it.  It's not as effective for him but it's still an upgrade.
---
With DM out and being Horde (rune of the guard captain), I think any BRD run with the risk of HoJ dropping should clarify prior to zoning, if there are potential loot issues.  Not saying anything should default to a flat need/greed for upgrades.
---
Warriors can wear whatever they want.  I'm not going to say you can't wear leather or even cloth if you want.  I just don't agree with the BiS lists taking priority.  If a rogue and a warrior are rolling for an item and it's BiS for the warrior but a huge upgrade for the rogue, the rogue should get to roll.
---
Yeah. It’s lvl2 and the quest giver is on the Main Street at the entrance of stormwind.
---
Not really, but it was the most legit reason to complain I could think of
---
Gouge only keeps them incapacitated for 5.5 seconds, and it takes 6s to drop combat, so you have to be good at spacing depending on who you're fighting in order to get the extra .5 s without entering combat as most people are mashing something instant to try and keep you in combat.   
---
Blind you shouldn't be having issues with unless its breaking early.
---
you’re not wrong
---
Oh gosh. Combat plates and debuff timers too. I saw a comment about Leatrix Pro but in my experiences with it nothing like the OPs set up was achievable!
---
because for the most part, horde out number ally on pvp servers thus are more likely to face this sorta thing
---
Which is equally stupid. Replace "f" for "r" in my comment and the point still stands.
---
17k listing on the ally AH. What is this guy talking about.
---
And hotness unless you're into necrophilia.
---
This man was worth 0 honor, phase 2 was an excuse to grief, not really pvp.
---
This is so sad, I loved coping against Team Træls and Venture. 
---
One could hope for a realm merge to even out the server
---
It's alright, definitely better than mirahs song. If you're human or have edgemasters Quel'Serrar will be better, and you can argue that it's better even if you're not human/don't have edgemasters. I'm a tauren without edgemasters and I'm using Quel'Serrar just cause it looks cooler.
---
The guy ganking others? Heck yeah we did. Had a blast doing it too.
---
Definitely not removed for same faction at least, reported someone for griefing a Rokhdelar demon last night.
---
As I said, survival means you live through the encounter. When you're outnumbered 4:1 you are going to.... stand and die? Or are you going to try and get away?
---
Smart decision - get away, and choose a class who can do that well. Others may enjoy the grey screen, I do not so I play a class who can either defeat, escape, or evade the enemy.
---
From what I've tried, the initial tagger just need to do over 10% of the damage to get full reward.
---
That addon is a good reference, but its definitely not correct a lot of the time. For example the Fury warrior PreRaid BIS is obviously built around a human, with dal rends as BIS which is 100% wrong for an orc.
---
What was the story with the flaming guy skiing though
---
This is fantastic. There are so many details in this video that are just hilarious.
---
yeah druids are good at running from danger to survive
---
If your alliance give paladin a chance, versatile and in my opinion, fun.
---
I haven't lost to a mage yet.
---
I don't have a ton of experience, but I believe that if you are losing threat to the DPS, it's largely their fault, and they often do it on purpose these days as they don't want to do less DPS in order to stay not pull aggro. They rob your rage when they do this.
---
Wearing a shield and holding threat off of the DPS would in turn reduce the threat caused by the healer, and of course provide you with rage. I suppose that's obvious, but I only say so because you say when it becomes mayhem even the healer is pulling threat, it's understandable, as there is a compounding effect.
---
I think the current meta involves running around like a chicken, just picking up the few of the mobs that escape blizzard. As arms you gain the ability to use taunt and mocking both, but lose the threat talent as prot.
---
I'm a fairly low level arms warrior but I intend to respec to prot if I bump into more threat problems (ie. if sweeping strikes doesn't do the trick.)
---
Charoid mentioned a mindset change. Mine was "I only have to protect the healer, the DPS all have the tools to handle themselves." I know that chicken feeling and didn't have it afterwards in BFD. A mage got to low health once but he didn't complain and it was a good run. I can only imagine that things are harder in Scholo and LBRS. I also tanked RFC with a 2-hander. After that, my take is  that, people say just slap on a shield and tank as arms, but those prot talents look like it would make things much easier. Not to mention, the mitigation and last stand will help the group more than tank DPS when things start to look like a wipe.
---
I'll also add that I also play a priest and try to 2-man dungeons with an arms warrior friend, and it's very hard not to pull threat off the warrior in that case if there are 4+ enemies, so heal threat is real. When things go south, the healer starts putting out big heals, and that's a ton of threat if nothing has died yet.
---
Dynamite helps, and maybe oil of immolation.
---
Where's the glory in being dead?
---
i don’t use Auctioneer (Auctionator) but surely you have to do scans to keep it up to date?
---
It only worked on the elites that were 6 levels or higher than he was, and it was a month or two ago. Doesn't work anymore, I tried it myself.
---
but that has nothing to do with this subreddit
---
I can't think of a single prebis piece that warriors expect prio over rogues on "because its their BiS". Its literally only warriors that could take leather upgrades from rogues that are not their BiS. Most warriors won't take those pieces. It sounds like you are pushing for warriors to steal more leather from rogues, not less. 
---
I think that the idea sounds nice on paper, but if you actually saw it in practice, its awful. Imagine if shamans rolled on every single cloth upgrade they could, not just their BiS cloth pieces. Imagine if warriors yoinked every single mail and leather upgrade they could.
---
You’ll hate warlock then. It’s literally shadowbolt spam from 100-0. Honestly most classes in classic revolve around 1 or 2 primarily abilities in PvE, there’s not much escaping it.
---
Replaced by AV in 5 days with ~2 days of grinding.
---
I actually didn't mind leveling in the high 30s. The low 30s we're hellish but after hitting 35 it got way better.
---
I started a shaman for classic (lvl 17). So far, really liking enhance. I'm sure it gets even better with a 2 hander and windfury.
---
There's a video of a lvl 44/45 mage soloing the zombies in zf for 120k exp/hr and pretty solid g/hr as well.
---
Yeah, druids are good at getting away to survive
---
shut up nerd
---
Prestige World Wide were in discord with the alliance telling them to kill any Horde that interfered with the alliance to kill Azuregos. Very cringe
---
the meta-meme is that the person felt like they needed to make this in the first place....
---
Rofllll
---
this!
---
I think it's just sort of selective hearing, I played WoW in vanilla as a caster and I'm playing a caster in Classic... I still have absolutely no idea how weapon damage works, how it's calculated or anything like hit caps or whatever, it's all basically gibberish to me. 
---
All I know is that I just need to shoot frostbolts at the warrior coming for me, or he'll tear through me like butter.
---
Is this on an EU server? I can hear the hardstyle beat coming on, haha. (I don’t know the song, so sorry if I’m wrong!)
---
-Fellow American that loves hardstyle
---
Besides better stories, better race options (DWARVES), better cities, and better posture, there's absolutely no reason to pick Alliance over Horde.
---
If you delete/sold the quest item can you get it back?
---
I find it funny that you told someone else in another post, "no need to be a dickhead", when you yourself are being a dickhead.
---
Im a Tauren as well! No Edgemaster's. Good to hear that it's better than Mirah's because that's what I was using previously. Quel'Serrar does look awesome, I hope to get it one day.
---
lmao fuck so guilty of this
---
Epic mount if you want to PvP.
---
If you're strictly a raider, get axe of the deepwoods and then lionheart. Axe is down to 140g on Whitemane. There's also a comparable axe from AV coming out in 6 days (worse than deep woods, but it will be fine for now while you wait for deep woods to drop in price).
---
Can hunters pre-trap?
---
In classic travel form is actually a cheetah, not a moose :(
---
Been a while since someone has dusted off the old kebab eh?
---
Fairbanks is a high pop server, having a que at peak times.  I know, there are also grind spots within badlands however due to uldaman I didn't suggest it.
---
Yeah but the flight clears the PvP flag whereas sitting in IF takes 5 minutes to clear the flag assuming you don't ever fight back when getting ganked in IF. If you fight back, the clock resets. So then you end up sitting in IF as a ghost for 3-4 minutes waiting for your flag to clear when you could have flown from thelsammar in less time. Idk how it is on your server but if you try to wait out the 5 minutes in IF alive on my server you have about a 10% chance a rogue doesn't make an attempt on your life.
---
Because its WoW CLASSIC... Not WoW Retail... If you were playing retail, it makes sense. But the people playing classic are basically people who used to play and liked the game before all the changes were made that they dont like, now..
---
And if you are new to WoW, why would you play WoW classic? Thats like, you FINALLY bought WoW after 15 years and youre playing the old version?... Or you never played the game and you started off by playing the special version that doesnt play how the normal game actually plays? That doesnt make sense..
---
&gt;level 5

u/JoJoPose1337, your post history consists of these gems:  
---
" This is why I dont date black chicks  "  
---
" Why blame the generation when you're just not attractive enough to get along with that generation  "  
---
" MLK beat his wife  "  
---
" Going to play yu gi oh duel links. Fuck Yalll  "  
---
"  I've been with multiple woman. Enough I cant even give you a number with out taking a minute to count names. I see why your a virgin  "  
---
Not really going to bother reading anything you post here.
---
Hunter is the biggest skill gap IMO
---
Perception as a rogue or perception in general is great for ganking
---
They are highly sought after in PvE.
---
Nah. First off healing stream is not really worth the mana it costs to put down. Youll get mana spring soon and pretty much never use healing stream again. The only totem you really need is searing totem? The totem that is single target, have rockbiter on your weapon if youre using a beefy staff or flametongue if 1h. Flameshock for the dot, earthshock when theyre low, lightning shield lasts several minutes so refresh it as it expires.  
---
Buuuut youre 32, go run sm dungeons until 42. You can just live in dungeons until 60 really. Especially since youre a shaman healer, warriors love you
---
Wow dude cool it with the ageism. Gonna be talking to the mods about this
---
Yeah even a couple hours won’t make a dent in the fact he can run it for multiples of that time daily.
---
What the hell is the big god damn deal if it has an nsfw tag. Why does it even slightly matter at all in any way whatsoever. What has that little tag done that it has ruined your day. Why do you give a shit.
---
I understood completely what being on a PvP server would be like, so I will not complain. However, for being a role-playing game, there are a disproprotionate number of people RPing as assholes.
---
Thanks, but my main question is whether it is the norm for shamans to "set up camp" with totems. As Enhancement spec, do you still use 2-3 totems for normal fighting?
---
I'm not involved with this but PWW is a dog shit guild regardless.
---
I keep forgetting to bring my Impending Doom for that myself, it'd also double to bring my own health down reducing the honour gain they'd get.. Thanks for the the reminder.
---
yep, all about choosing the right moment with a warrior to get max distance
---
Yo me 30 seconds
---
Mages do a lot of solo farming and get some BOP's that DE a lot more than vendor value.  A good example is the gloves from ZF GY boss.  They vendor for like 80 silver but DE into about 3g.  Doing 5 runs an hour you are making an extra 11g/hr just from disenchanting 1 BOP item
---
reroll one of the good classes like mage or warlock
---
900g regular cost, 810g with honored faction or rank 3 pvp, 720g with both. Honored and rank 3 both give 10% vendor discounts that stack.
---
I'd do zf and mara with you but you rolled ally.
---
Spamming the same line won't get you anywhere, do you have anything to add to the conversation, or you going to just be mindlessly saying the same line, because you have to face the reality that 1v1 means nothing, and running into 1vX is reality on most servers. (For either faction)
---
minmaxing even the bags!
---
and what happens if they camp you for 15minutes?
---
some people are seriously starved for honor and will do some boring shit to get a tiny bit of it
---
You're lucky you're a warrior, at least you can immune to fear and run a few feet forward. Imaging getting feared backwards. Yes, there are times where classes like priest make NEGATIVE gains in moving towards their location.
---
Because they're pricks who dont care about other peoples experience
---
Find a raid who will take a ret first.
---
I initially picked alliance because I liked the aesthetics better. Now I pick them because they're what I know.
---
They will become more gear checks followed by can you play your class. Its 1.12 patch so bowl won't be that bad but aq40 will. I remember though pugging aq40 back in the day up to twin emps right before tbc
---
Someone can't decipher blatant sarcasm.
---
Where did I rage about that?
---
I personally did not, I think you’re over placing those.. my norm rotation was lightning shield, flame shock, place searing, whack away, flame/frost shock one more time, then auto to death
---

T2 has moose horns
---
The point here of course being if someone says "I was banned unfairly for hate speech", and their history is filled with hate speech, it's really doubtful that there was anything unfair about their ban.
---
But I digress, if this person wants to tell us what they said, we can all carefully consider if it's hate speech.
---
u/m3ta1he4d \- I've been playing a lock since 2004, and I highly suggest going demonology for easier questing. Let your blueberry handle multiple enemies while you dot, SB, and wand your way through quests. Easy-peasy :)
---
Except our stuns use spell hit haha. You'd have to use Banthok's Sash and shit =D
---
Sorry, its realllly hard to tell when there are people out there like that. As you can tell by other comments
---
lol I'm agreeing with you? are you special? druids are great at surviving by running away
---
1v1 means nothing? K you are obvs special
---
Just logged in and general consensus in IF is that most guilds will transfer. What a coincidence that Blizz suddenly decided to stop transfers on the 6th of December...
---
For warlocks, here's the spell damage co-efficients towards the middle of this page:  [https://www.senilechieftains.com/guide/warlock](https://www.senilechieftains.com/guide/warlock)
---
If memory serves well, you lose combo points only if you target something else, not when you drop your target. This can be useful when fighting other rogues - if they restealth, don't target anything else and you will keep your combo points once they re-appear.
---
Always go with what makes the money
---
I definitely could be wrong.  I'm just applying some basic behavioral psychology.  Typically, (according to mainstream psychology) those who nitpick and correct others' behavior are the ones who are most insecure about their own.  Hence, the over-compensation and approval-seeking behavior. 
---
I know it's weird, sometimes psychology seems so backwards xD
---
Aaaaaand nothing happened.

What's the ratio? My friend just fled there from Bigglesworth.

Hi, /u/random-short-guy

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e65o0f/when_does_feast_of_winter_veil_start/). 
---
the best way to get answers is to join the classic discord for each class.
---
R WORD BAD
---
He lied
---
Yeah i think so, right now the only way to rank up quickly is ganking so..
---
&gt;majority of the current playerbase think PvP is stupid and it’s not what they expected/were told before release
---
The actual cornerstone of our argument is you somehow try to account people who don't care/aren't related to pvp as supporters of your own opinion while they actually don't care at all about that. 
---
1. PVE servers people: either don't care about PVP at all or very well expected the shitstorm in phase 2 (or actually paid attention to the warnings everywhere, this sub included) so they rolled PVE just for the sake of not being ganked constantly. You cannot account them as "unhappy" people, they are very much happy playing classic.
---
2. PVP servers players who don't care about pvp and they play for majority faction: they just happily do their own things. They go raiding, they go open world farming, they level their characters, they gear in 5 man dungeons. They are happy with this game as well, they have no issues with the game, you cannot account them as "people think pvp isn't what they expected to be". They are unrelated to the problem at all. They haven't played this game for pvp. It's just a small part of gameplay for them.
---
3. PVP server players who care about pvp and belong to majority faction. Yeah these people will build death squads, they will camp your flypath and entrance to all dungeons after 48, they will flood all quest areas for these levels, they will go to boats and they will go to inn in your capital and kill you when you hearth back in. They are related to pvp, they do it. You should account their opinion which is positive, they are happy and content with what they are doing, because if they aren't happy, they have a freedom of choice to stop and join group 2.
---
4. People form pvp servers who belong to minority faction. They can't go to dungeon to farm without dying 10+ times, they can't take a fp without being ganked immediately upon landing, they can't even visit their capital without dying right after they HS. I don't even mention questing. They are unhappy people who go here on reddit and complain. 
---
My point is group 3 (people who happy with PVP because they can overwhelm the minority faction) is bigger than group 4 (people who are unhappy with PVP because they are overwhelmed by majority faction). That's my only point. Stop dragging bystanders as people who "support your opinion". Yes, they can visit reddit and upvote another poor thing which logged off after 10+ deaths on his way to BRD. Yes, they can write a warm comment to farm karma if they care about karma even. Will they take any steps in game to support it? Like, transfer out of their server to the server where they are going to be minority? Reroll to a minority faction to help ease the balance? Hell no. If they are, they are an extreme exception since I am yet to see a carebear to take these steps.
---
Because it's the norm. Most pvp servers are horde dominated. Earthfury is renowned for being one of the few that aren't, get out of your bubble.
---
Pretty sure these BGs will kill our guild's second raid group off as the casuals will gravitate to these, but I'm not complaining.
---
I'm looking for in-depth info/videos related to endgame healing as a Priest. I've taken all I can from Wowhead and similar websites, is there a resource out there that goes more in-depth?
---
A guild that actually wants to prep for BWL will want limit gear to the specs/classes that is benefits the most.  Choker of FL is a caster DPS piece, lock/mage prio.  
---
Additionally, your better, more pre-BIS prepared mages/locks will extract the most benefit from it for the sake of the rest of the raid.  Giving it to someone who is getting carried in greens is kinda a waste, and encourages low effort raid logging.  I'd give the lower tier players the other choker.
---
I had a bunch of Hord cast dispell magic on me whenever I had that costume. There was even a guy that logged out next to the spawn and had the respawn on a timer. Mofo would log in 30 seconds before respawn and dispell everyone.
---
^ this
---
To be fair, I don't watch his stream today it popped up while i was bored at work though so I watched a little. Have no knowledge of his past or gimmick so you would know more than me
---
Yes, if you’d like to look at these situations as superficially as possible, they are both exactly the same, as in they are both PVP
---
Now, if we look at these two things more critically, do you see how they are not exactly the same?
---
I don't typically mind going on reserve runs if it's 1 piece of gear I don't need. The other day though, someone asked me if I could heal Arena/Anger runs but a ret pally was reserving Second Wind... 
---
Like how can you justify reserving a healing trinket while not actually healing the run?
---
LOL. What did he say?
---
Yup totally agree. I post answers to a lot of googlable questions in the Daily Questions thread. I know because I check myself on most of my own posts to make sure I'm giving good information. I like helping other people so I don't really mind and since I have a base knowledge I can probably find the answer quicker than the other person could. If you don't want to help simply don't reply to that person. Sometimes I'll see misinformation and hit reply only to decide I don't want to battle about someone being wrong, so I pass over the comment for someone looking for help.
---
Your attitude is completely fine... most of us have limited play time and it is entirely unreasonable for people to expect you to log on and spend all your time helping them.
---
I help when I can if I have the time and if it’s something I feel like doing... generally I like to help, but that doesn’t mean I want to give up what I had planned to powerlevel someone who can’t be bothered finding a group for SM or whatever.
---
.... of warcraft.
---
Some of these people really don't understand warlock's kit. Do they think paladins will be able to do much of anything with curse of tongues on them constantly? Once they blow BOF and it's devoured, your flag carrier is going to be COEX'd over and over again. 
---
The goal isn't even to kill the paladin it's to separate him from the group with fear while applying curse of tongues. And if they do decide to start channeling a heal, there's the fel hunter ready with spell lock.
---
Back in vanilla with premade vs premade that was literally my only job: make sure the paladin doesn't do anything.
---
I don't really mind THAT MUCH if someone near my level kills me while questing, comes with the territory, but I was questing with a bud and 2 alliance rogues attack us, we hold our own, UNTIL a 60 lock joins in the carnage and then proceeds to kill us over and over while helping the other two AoE farm mobs there.
---
I have a level 12 mage that I play only occasionally (was my bank alt for a while). But whenever I'm ready to log off (usually in Org), I look around for someone under level 20 to give free water and/or food to -- warriors first, then priests/shamans, then anyone else. I've given away 0 (zero) free stuff. Either there is no one under 20 around, or those I offer to (whisper) say "No thanks."
---
&gt; Both of those are pvp. 
---
I said that multiple times. Why are you now trying to be technically correct now?
---
Is this a less than 24 hour repost hitting the front page again. Yikes
---
He killed only the necessary mobs that can't be skipped and the bosses. (according to what he said in the video that is)
---
It absolutely does. They're talking via discord cross faction. The examples I used were malicious, and this one wasn't. It's still talking via discord cross faction. 
---
This feels fun and humble and wholesome so I brought up malicious examples that are effectively the same thing; communicating with people on other factions to change the outcome of the game.

Couple months since I dipped into some condiments tbh, I'm not ashamed to admit it
---
If BG’s aren’t cross realm then the current WPVP status quo will be maintained, and no one wants that. Who knows if cross realm BG’s will alleviate it, but it certainly won’t make it worse.
---
dire maul went live on a tuesday, 6 pm for europeans. azu and honor did indeed go live on a thursday however.
---
I would say you put in less than that for sure but you make less than everyone else in game because you De  all greens and blues.  Your friends will have 100s of gold and you will have 5g.  And they all want free enchants
---
&gt;The second those gankers pause to think "Hm, maybe I'll be nice this time", they get killed by gankers themselves. 
---
They don't get killed by the level 52 obviously in the middle of an escort quest. Maybe leave him be, as you no doubt would wish the other party would do for you if the roles were reversed?
---
It's not a hard concept to understand: for some people, being a decent fellow player is more of a reward in and of itself than a slim chance at eventually reaching rank 12/13/14 and getting epic loot that no one will care about except for yourself. 
---
You could argue that the game "encourages" this all you want (yeah, I'm sure killing people doing escort quests and resetting their progress was Blizzard's intention and not a minor oversight from 2004), but at the end of the day, if you've developed any social skills or empathy as a person, you probably wouldn't lower yourself to that level over the most minute of gains towards a goal you probably won't ever see through. 
---
&gt;on a pvp server, get help or get out.
---
Great advice, except when it falls flat on the majority of servers where the "help" is nowhere to be found in an already dejected and outnumbered faction. Yes, you could gain the upper hand for a brief moment and maybe even complete your quest, but who wants to go through all that trouble for every single quest chain taking place outside of an instance? 
---
This game is already enough of a grind and timesink for people with any semblance of a social, academic, or family life. It doesn't need to be exacerbated by a few sweaty edgelords fantasizing themselves in High Warlord or Grand Marshal gear.
---
Refreshing buffs generates the same threat as initial application.
---
They aren’t role playing...
---
It's clear to me now you don't really understand what a reasonable guild is in this scenario.  Of course it's minmaxing.  You have to when drops are limited.  If you don't you're simply a casual guild or if it's a guild trying to be serious then their priorities are woefully misplaced or they misunderstand why you need to prioritize loot in the first place.
---
Druid sounds like a git fit for you. You have the most involved rotation start at lvl 40 when you can really start powershifting. You bave lots of different ways to approach solo content and can pug as any role.
---
Just take care that at end game it's very hard to make cat dps work.
---
2 60s means you play atleast 6h a day mate. That is a lot
---
This is Mak the gora way
---
In pugs, though, you occasionally get a hero druid/mage who carries the team with superior flag skills.
---
It costs 9silver per combat potion if you are rank 6. You can basically spam them without regard. So, is it okay to use them while they are essentially part of your pvp arsenal?
---
I got my shadow orb after maybe 3 runs. The luck is real.
---
I duel like i pvp. 
---
EVERYTHING goes :) 
---
Just give them a heads up! Because if you pop a Health pot without telling them people get pissed lol
---
Druid can’t be sheeped.
---
Im lvl 60 with most pre bis its just an RNG thang
---
Actually this is extremely simple. Use google docs and let it free to edit, the only work is to setup the spreadsheet. After this each person fills its own list the first time.
---
Raid time -&gt; lock the spreadsheet from editing (except you).
---
After someone picks one item, just paint the cell in red and set this cell to not be editable. So the player can reorganize its own list but never the locked number.
---
You can even have one tab that you simply put the item name and it will inform you which players have the lower number for it with some simple formulas.
---
Clicked release on a boat while it was going between islands and this happened haha. Couldn't move either.
---
Why would you make an alt on a new server?  I use my 60 to boost my alt
---
Free transfers closing. Paid transfers incoming
---
&gt; If #nochanges really won, half of these problems would not exist in the first place. Layering would never have been a thing, and servers would not have 20k ppl on them, instead just 3k.
---
Daily reminder that A: max concurrent census counts are 7k, not 20k, B: max concurrent players in Vanilla was 4k, not 3k, and C: Blizzard never stated that they would increase the layer concurrent capacity beyond that of live Vanilla and the only evidence we have to the contrary are census addons that Blizzard claims to have broken. Also, in the stress tests for Classic, each layer held a maximum concurrent player count of 3k.
---
They always remove my posts so I stopped posting lmao
---
I’m hoping the 920 is just a made up number... cos that’s like 460 hours with a great group..
---
i... would tend to disagree. i think tbc/wrath both have a great blend of casual accessibility and variety of choice alongside a dense and interesting meta and progression through the expansion
---
classic's pvp progression, for instance, was very limited and extremely casual-unfriendly. tbc changed honor to a currency and added ranked arena so the hardcore players would have a separate progression system, and separate fancy gear to show off
---
also, tbc made a ton of previously meme-only specs viable on their own - ret paladins getting crusader strike for instance - which deepened the meta significantly, both in terms of pvp and pve
---
raids being reduced from 20/40 mans to 10/25 mans in tbc was huge, the massive faceless guilds that classic created by forcing a raid leader to corral 39 cats for 3 hours to clear naxx were now no longer the only people who could access endgame content and gear. individual skill matters more in a smaller raid, as well
---
tier sets being separated by spec and dropping as tokens was a wildly underappreciated change in tbc - how many times have you done ony and a t2 head that nobody can use drops? worse, how sad is it that prot paladins and bear tanks don't have any good epic gear to use, so their gear progression stops at the 5-man blue level? 3 classes on each token and every (distinct) spec having its own set means that a token rarely drops, even in a 10-man, that *somebody* can't use, and that if everyone already has their main spec tier piece, someone can use it for an off spec
---
tbc made a lot of huge, sweeping changes to the way wow worked, and almost all of them were for the better. the only one you can really make a strong case for being negative long-term was the introduction of flying, and even that has pros too, like the ability to create zones that existed in three dimensions, and flying-exclusive areas like TK and skettis
---
basically, tbc was the best expansion and you can't change my mind lol
---
Resto shamans gear rapidly due to the tri armour class, shields, multi weapon types and the abundance of healing gear that is bis for a long time out of dire maul, BRD, L/UBRS, scholo and strat. You can gear for +600 healing in blues man. I have 7/8 tier 1 and the only piece I use is the shoulders. Everything else is offpiece or my blues. 
---
Your bis cape is also crafted.
---
I would recommend resto shaman in 1.12 they are easily the best raid healers on horde.
---
Well crusader just heals you, while lifestealing actually hurts them and heals you.  The bonus damage from the 100 str though would still make up for that I would think so still crusader better IMO.
---
Also lifestealing is just cheaper to enchant
---
He said the bot turns away if he (player) tags before the bot. Seems like the bot will never help him kill a mob. Or am I missing something?
---
I gained so much satisfaction the other day when I got to deny a gank squad any honor by quickly life tap —&gt; hellfire suiciding before any of them got close enough to touch me.
---
Why should I care about some other guild on my faction getting loot over a different guild not on my faction? Neither helps my guild and neither are in an alliance with me.
---
In fact that other guild may have caused a lot more issues than the opposing faction through drama/poaching/ninjaing/trashtalking/etc. Depending on the history of the server there are a ton of reasons why someone wouldn't want to help another particular guild for no benefit to themselves.
---
Duels are about practicing how you play. 
---
And in real pvp, people be popping flasks and pots like its nothing
---
Go play soccer kid
---
Look... when it comes to SGC, people get that by doing arena runs. If you invite a hunter to the group why *exactly* do you think he’s there? To farm a chest piece for a random warrior, or because maybe he wants it himself?
---
&gt; I was expecting blizzlike server populations. Anything else is a massive change from vanilla, possibly bigger than layering and maybe even flying mounts would have been.
---
It's entirely possible that what we're seeing right now are actual blizzlike server populations (4k concurrent cap) with the most stacked 60 bracket ever, making it feel like there's more concurrent players than in Vanilla.
---
Thanks!
---
problem is that wrath is 1.5 sec, but NG procs will bring it down to 1.0 yet gcd is still 1.5 seconds. so yeah NG is completely useless if you arent also involving starfire, but mixed rotation isnt good till wotlk eclipse
---
Because the implication behind you saying the are both PVP is that if I complain about one situation, I cannot complain about the other. I am trying to point at that simply because they both fall under the category of PVP, does not make them the same exact thing.
---
Saying I like PVP does not mean I can’t be critical of certain aspects of it
---
Lol the run from the Bulwark to UC really reflects well on alliance players.
---
Just get aquamentas and call it a day.
---
Mage can solo mara from 46-53
---
At 52, i was getting 1 1/2 bars every ~10 minutes
---
Following for info
---
With Classic Threat Meter also allows you to recolor the nameplates, btw :).
---
there is an addon that will right click on every body FOR you?
---
Warlock disc is definitely lit.  Great info, discussion, theory, simulations, etc.
---
I'm a level 60 druid that didn't really level up my professions on the way. 
---
Right now I have enchanting at around 100 and plan on keeping it for the tanking trinket eventually. 
---
What's another good second profession I can pick up and level that will either be really useful in PvE or help me make gold?
---
I was thinking engineering for the jumper cables and other useful items. I'm on a PvE server though so I'm not sure how useful it will be.
---
Would skinning or mining be good for gold? Is there anything else that would complement enchanting well as a druid?
---
I'm HotW/NS hybrid specced and tank dungeons and heal raids usually. I don't mind investing in leveling up a new profession if it will pay off. Thanks for any advice!
---
Im sure it would be fine on my server. In fact I get ganked everyday by alliance. Just play smart. Some zones can no longer be leveled in by either faction till bgs I imagine. Also epic mount helps me run away from ali trying to gank me.
---
You say you like pvp but then complain about pvp.
---
Shamans are not brain dead. High skill mediocre reward though.
---
r/Bettereveryloop
---
If you OP wants diversity and a diverse leveling experience I cannot recommend the druid enough.
---
Off the top of my head, every class spell was allowed except for health stones which nerfs SL/SL
---
At least the population density in the open world should go down as people are in BGs so I would guess that it will make questing doable. It's reasonable to me that BGs should alleviate the roaming gank squads issue at least a bit.
---
Ima practice hitting homers off fastballs but Im only gonna hit change ups in batting practice....? 
---
Practice how you play. Period.
---
They make it way more accessible though, which means more people meeting the 15 weekly HKs to count towards the ranking system. That should mean there are more casual pvpers to fill up the lower ranks.
---
Or just play horde on a pve server.
---
Druids would like a talk
---
lmao shit they actually patched that?
---
Tanks that are specced into their prot spec tends to farm worse in solo play, they need to get their income from other places. Tanking things tend to accrue costs due to wipes, expensive plate gear in most cases, not needing any specific gear cus they're relatively easy to gear in their MS (when they tank, there's usually no other tank to need their specific gear). So they run out of incentives to do the runs that don't have great loot you can sell for a good price, like Righteous Orbs. But even the orbs aren't guaranteed since all partymembers need it. So between the lack of incentives from the instances itself, and the demand of tanks for the many dps who constantly compete between themselves to get their pieces of gear and use longer time per character to get to prebis (unless they specifically shape their group around it, taking extra time); they can easily require payment for their service that'd otherwise not be worth their time and groups can get going faster.
---
So one day I wandered into one of those psuedo empty bars in the Mage Quarter and there was indeed Free Drinks and Food.  Later on I did a quest and after you turn in, the guy makes a "feast" in your honor with clickable drinks and food on the table.  I literally clicked on and took every single item.  I forget it if counted as conjured or not. Because I don't remember carrying it in my inventory for that long.  I'm at work and can't look this up right now.
---
I just have no idea what people expected to happen. The honor system sucks and it always has.
---
exactly. thats why I said SL warlock specifically and not conflag or SM/Ruin. if left alone a SL warlock can kill a hpal just fine but the job isn't to kill him (right away anwyay) its to completely mitigate anything he can do while still being able to be useful against other targets. its amazing how people are talking like they are so sure about what they're saying but clearly don't understand a common class/spec they're going to see in BGs lmao
---
LF RP guild/party to make a role event involving this npc as the main character of the story.
---
Of course basic shit is obvious. Duh. But there are questions that are not well documented that take previous knowledge to get answers to. Like "what quest starts from the fourth cauldron farm in wpl?"
---
If you decide to try and answer that question time how long it takes you to find it.
---
As a Horde I had to redo this quest about 6 times over 4 hours, in between people grabbing it before I could, because it kept glitching out.
---
Fuck this quest.
---
I am not sure how to comment on this.
---
This behavior does break pvp server TOS
---
Woosh
---
I have never seen this before, bloody hilarious!
---
Different faction PvP servers? Some people play both sides, if you know what I mean.
---
Looks like a raid group heading into MC to keep their world buffs
---
Horde are MOST of the problem due to server imbalance. We wanna act like its equal. Its not. The numbers just dont add up to that across all PvP realms minus what? Heartseeker? Dishonest Horde scumbags want to point to one realm as an excuse for their op faction.
---
Good writeup. I play Ally on Stalagg. I actually did a bunch of research and monitored faction balance on Stalagg prior to launch. All signs were pointing to a decent balance, discord census, reddit census, all of it had a slight Horde advantage. Free transfers and the hysteria from the census addon took a huge chunk out of the Alliance.
---
Fine, stating then. I think it's incredibly self-centred of you to state that there's something wrong with him asking questions. 
---
How can you call him lazy and disrespectful for that? I don't see how those questions can be taken as disrespectful. 
---
Fair point on those other comments of yours by the way (just replying to them here rather than to each individually, lazy of me though that may be :P), there appears to be some jerks in this thread.
---
TIL darnassus has an AH
---
I wish I could transfer to the minority faction, they ranking is so much better. But this reddit consists of dad gamers who try to do dungeons at peak hours and complain about getting killed.
---
Why :(
---
If you have made it to mobs to fight someone is surely lazy ganker, most people die after they get off FP.
---
Are you mentally handicapped?
---
Horde - Bring a Shaman, Alliance - Dwarf Priest for fear ward.
---
The issue with fear is it is entirely RDM at a certain point. So unless your raid has people popping CC's on melee DPS and tank to prevent fear. They will inevitable be knocked into whelps. Don't feel bad about it.
---
Where are the level 40-45 ones hanging out please?
---
SoS spiders?
---
LEMME KNOWWWWW
---
Its always the rich that ask for tax cut !
---
&gt; fits the role of what our class is supposed to do in BG’s
---
which is shut down enemy healers/casters right? do you think SM/Ruin does that better than SL? even though any half decent group is gonna peel someone off what they're doing to go after the warlock thats completely locking down their healer?  Just trying to figure out why you think what you think thats all
---
whats your point, i never said there wasnt any resources online, i said information was spread through word of mouth or book alot more back then
---
Interesting. Still doesnt mean much though
---
Which is why you should reflect upon why there's so many threads about this subject. Maybe you're in the outlier?
---
I honestly agree. As someone who played vanilla back when it came out, I would have loved to see just a few quality of life changes for classic. Dual specs and guild banks were the 2 I wanted the most. But #nochanges, so what can ya do?
---
Ahhh this is painful
---
I didn’t say I hate PVP. I like PVP, but I dislike certain aspects of it present in WoW. Does that make sense?
---
I almost want to bring some runes just to spite them further haha
---
Na, it was in the rules to not use health stones. There was a worry about them giving health stones to other players, but it really just seemed like a nerf. Warriors got to use mighty rage potions as well, to make them a little better at duels. Rogues got guaranteed opener and warriors got guaranteed charge unless it was against a stealth class. Hunters couldn’t pre trap but shamans could pre totem. 
---
The tournament wasn’t accurate, result wise, due to the balancing rules.
---
Found link, too, Asmon talks about it in first 5 minutes

If you think it was happening at this level you’re outright incorrect.
---
I had a guy respond to one of my comments here with "have conversations on your own time, don't waste other people's time".
---
People that believe they shouldn't have a conversation unless they have something to gain or are going to gain intrinsic value in it are extremely selfish.
---
As a Warlock I just assumed he looted 3 Voidwalkers, a Succubus, and a Dispel
---
Same, this + jump runs is how I got my lionheart and my epic mount.
---
lmao, but you'd be lying if you ain't want the same regardless of your situation.
---
I love how you choose two pathetic options and asked me to select one of them.  
---
Well played!  
---
My goal here was to question statement that "Alliance behave the same as Horde". Thanks for your confirmation about this.  
---
What to do and how to manage this - is a separated topic.
---
If you've reached your dungeon lockout (5 per hour) and reset it on an alt, your main will be hearthed home. I'm not sure what other conditions cause this to happen.
---
I feel you man like if it doesn't actually take anything away from the gameplay then... why not?
---
You are right. My argument there is that if a warlock wants to sandbag and not choose any gear so they can hog one drop, that is their prerogative. If other people are 4 or 5/8 on their tier while this other person is all blues waiting for mageblade, that is their choice.
---
I have also seen SKs who use a separate list for classes and open for all. This way a rogue only list is available for their tier, and they do not lose their standing on the overall list for Ony Neck / brutality blade or w/e.
---
 I get a little chapped when one person has a lucky night with MS &gt; OS Roll rules that has them walking out with three pieces. I have always been wary of DKP for people throwing fits and causing drama. As a healer I like the idea of a Gold DKP system where myself and the tanks can cash out versus the classes who can farm gold easier. Ultimately not taking loot seriously is how I approach the issue, because getting your panties in a wad because over the colour purple is not worth it.

---
On a side note. You wouldn't use Deathbringer for tanking except for if you were dual wield tanking which you shouldn't be doing if you're not relatively geared. Quel'Serrar is more or less just bought. I got mine from a guilde doing jump runs in DM:E, then it's just a quick stroll do Dire Maul, kill Onyxia, then back to Dire Maul.
---
Check your auction house for Foror's Compendium of Dragonslaying.
---
I am over arguing with people about researching shit. At the end of the day I really don't think providing people with proper information even matters, because people are just shitheads. You can give people all the information in the world that they should vaccinate their kids...and some shitheads just wont listen. I sincerely believe that if I explained the difference between PVE and PVP servers he would have ignored me, shot himself in the foot, and the blamed it all on someone else. If someone else had taken the time to do all the research for him and presented him with all the evidence he would have very likely still fucked himself over. A lot of people are just like this.
---
Thanks guys! This was all very helpful!
---
Pretty sure there's no more honor after the 4th kill. I'm sure they were having a fun time fucking with the bots and killing them, who doesn't? But if you're pressed for time, kill them 4 times, get your honor, then report them and move on.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
... they are clowns who dont undestand that there are other people siting on the other side of the screen who preferebly die no more then 5x to a single enemy before being able to opt out of pvMASIVE FUCKING ZERGE 
---
xD
---
When people start getting geared priests can probably afford to spend their extra mana on smite to speed it up i could see it being efficient
---
I think you're highly underestimating the amount of health/mitigation a warlock has and a warlock running around with a pocket healer vs a warrior running around with a hpal isn't exactly the most common scenario now is it? I'd see no point in taking that fight as a warlock anyway. Not like it is unwinnable in the slightest but not in their favor. 
---
i'm also not saying a SL warlock is some amazing hard counter to every situation ever against a pally, i'm simply saying people are acting like paladins are some beyond amazing unstoppable BG healers that will dominate over horde and thats simply not true, mostly because in most situations that arise in BGs a good warlock, SL or not, can shut down a hpal really hard, and moreso/easier/for longer as SL.
---
The discord is kind of like a bible for information and brainstormy conversations. https://discord.gg/GWabHRN
---
With people and things
---
My server is unplayable for alliance outside of raid day so I am passing the time leveling on a less horde dominated one.
---
Warlocks can kills the dragons safely before adds arrive with enough gear.
---
Ya give us flying mounts and every other QoL improvement while you’re at it!! /s
---
They're taking the money and reinvesting it in retail.
---
Having dual spec is very game breaking to the economy. Having to respect is a gold sink that helps reduce the inflation. Without a gold sink most classes could farm effectively and still be able to raid effectively making the price of goods and services more expensive because everybody has money.I play as a holy paladin and but I can only efficiently farm as protection, if I could do both I wouldn't have an issue with money at all.
---
You are looking for world of faircraft
---
This war
---
Maybe if you're wearing cloth. Or if you don't have a PvP trinket.
---
No pots. Apart from that, everything goes imo.
---
I'd argue it's slightly worse than that since he's not saying it's disrespectful just to ask him specifically the question, (which I could sort of understand) but to ask general chat the question. Which to me just seems bizarre, like people asking questions in general chat shouldn't really affect him one way or another in my opinion.
---
It’s getting too the dragons that’s the hard bit,
---
I remember the arcane middle spam, I think it was the most Mana efficient skill at the time.....good times
---
I guess this is like a 5man dungeon utility build that you intend to keep at 60. Obviously it's not for raiding so I'll try and think about how you will actually use this build.
---
As you have chosen Imp Sap over Serrated Blades, I guess you hope that someone will want you to sap in dungeons or maybe you want to sap in WPVP. In that case you really should get some MoD so you're not seen (by mobs or players) as you close in to sap. Otherwise, shift those points out of Imp Sap and into Serrated Blades and start using Rupture on high-armor dungeon bosses and warriors/paladins in PvP.
---
Or put your last point into Hemo so it's a more effective PvP build. Or put it into Imp Kick for a little more utility.
---
All those words for nothing
---
Go with whichever makes more money. Thorium on our server isn’t worth much above vendor but high end herbs have held or increased value over time. Arcane crystal farming doesn’t justify mining alone in my opinion. Look at the next phases, herbs will be more needed for bwl than for MC but thorium demand will not spike during this phase.
---
I’m not a “no changer”. It would make sense to add great stuff such as dual spec. “No change” had its place on the core of the idea. Now that we’re here. No one want to admit that its wrong and there should have some change. The idea was to bring back the old good wow as we used to like it. There are bad stuff going on in classic wow that could be fix. It would be fun for the most of us.
---
Edit: I start classic wow in the hope to get to BC and the birth of arena pvp.
---
Depends on your definition of pug.
---
BWL i imagine will be "pugged" by guilds, core of 15-20 players from one guild pugging out the last spots seems do able. When it comes to full pugs sure some good and regular pugs might do it but i imagine the average quick form ones will make it a few bosses in then stall and won't be doing full clears. Not all pugs are equal if you have a regular pug you run MC and Ony with now and they stay pretty regular core wise they might be fine.
---
AQ40 I never ran but from all I hear i doubt it will be puggable unless again it's a guild filling a few spots and those fills will likely become regulars if they are any good.
---
Because alliance dominated servers are PvE.
---
I agree with this if you mention that you had asked the party how to run it, get no reply.
---
 A few minutes ago, we enacted a change to how the populations are calculated in the WoW Classic realm list. Since shortly after the launch of WoW Classic, the realm list population labels have indicated real-time population levels.
---
Now, the Low/Medium/High/Full labels are based on peak population over the last 7 days. We believe this provides a more-useful picture of a realm’s population to players who are making decisions about which realm to play on or transfer to.
---
The realms which have not yet moved to one layer will continue to be marked “Layered”.
---
Thank you!

---
BWL is still significantly harder than MC. It can be cleared somewhat casually but not by a raid you fill in world chat.
---
fuck off, go cry for censorship somewhere else.
---
Join LFG channel if you haven't already, /join LFG or /join 4. It's a global chat channel so you'll be able to be people looking for groups all across Azeroth.
---
You don't use pets in end game - imp sits in phase shift for the buff or it'll die most fights, that's if you're not spec'd DS/Ruin which is the best end-game PvE spec for the first 3-phases. If you're DM you literally don't have a pet at all because you sacrifice it for the +15% dmg buff. In raids you get assigned 1 curse that you use for the entire raid, and unless you're the lucky one who gets assigned Curse of Agony/Doom, the curses you're assigned have a 5 minute duration. So you'll apply once per fight. In 5-mans mobs die too fast to warrant using anything other then corruption + shadowbolt spam. Shards are frankly an annoying mechanic and it's just more shit to carry.
---
If you're into PvP then yea Warlock is pretty fun - but on that note Mage is pretty amazing for PvP also, so I didn't really get into that comparison.
---
I understand both sides but if you’ve got a new member and nobody makes the effort to engage with them I think that’s kinda poor, also this is game is a terrible experience solo.
---
I typically try to position myself so I can pull multiple mobs back to my totems.  So yes, I usually try to "set up a camp".  Sometimes it isnt possible if the mobs are heavily spaced out and in those cases I just use a searing totem.
---
Wow... Yeah some of these answers are really eye opening. It's impressive to me that people can be that selfish to feel disrespected by seeing other people ask questions in general chat.
---
Drop mining. Long term you will make more money with herbalism and who in their right mind farms their engineering mats instead of just buying them.
---
I roll engi/herbalism and it’s great
---
Yeah and then you afk until Tirion comes.
---
Nope I’m attuned. It’s just that I live in the UK timezone whereas all EU servers are Berlin Time Zone, so I work like until 5:30/6:00 every day with a 45min commute meaning I’m home around 7 UK time. My current guild and most guilds on my server start around 7 Server time (so 6 UK time), no chance for me. Have been asking around a few guilds, latest I found was 7:30 server time. 
---
PUGs seem to run around the same time. And weekends are for Girlfriend, Friends, and Family I don’t want to have to plan in a raid as I do spontaneous trips very often on weekends. 
---
Yeah I’m a casual but I still manage to play 3-4 hours a day (which is a lot tbh) just at the *wrong* time. 
---
Spoke to a few people living in UK timezone and they all struggle. Might need to make my own guild that does later raids. Still looking for a guild at the moment though.
---
i mean if im not far away i'm gonna help. if you're being corpsecamped in theramore while im in scarlet monastery, im obviously not coming
---
Sure it'll affect the economy, but to say it's "game-breaking" is an exaggeration imo. What will be game-breaking is how much fun it'll be to play 2 of my favorite specs without it being a money sink every time I want to adapt my playstyle lol.
---
I was unaware of that change, thank you for the link :)
---
How's that the same? One's directly affecting my gameplay and how I go about it, the other one is in regards to movement speed lol.
---
yep already ruining some horde players that quest just by dispelling the buff and walk away :)))
---
How many priests do you bring to Onyxia?
---
Your question confuses me. You can backstab from anywhere on her side... Why would you think sinister strike would change anything about the fear pathing?
---
Cast time for open door is faster than lockpick. Also for higher level doors (Dire Maul) it can fail.
---
Currently level 22, loving the class:

---
It is an inconvenience spending 100g to pop back and forth between wanting to min/max two separate avenues of the game. However, in my opinion it creates a sense of identity with what I play. Sure, I have a pretty well maintained off-spec set and occasionally pop into shadow after a raid night and dick around for a few days, it's fun but it does feel foreign -- I play a disc priest. I know everything about my gear choices, my personal to-do list is clear, and I've mapped out goals for the progression of my character. Retail slowly evolved into stages of instead of playing a spec, now you play a class; then onward into instead of playing a class, now you play a role. 
---
When I log on to my main, it feels like a disc priest. It's simple and the progression I see on that character feels rewarding.
---
Spellcasters need 3 percent hit to be capped for pvp, but remember as a frost mage the elemental precision talent is available to you.
---
and why do you think that's a bot?
---
Stand as close to the head as you can while still backstabbing. The sword rogues are roughly in the same spot. Sometimes you get bad luck with fear...it happens you can't do much about it.
---
Perhaps using deadly poison? But yea, what everyone else said. Disengage and spam the keybind for stealth. Also... keybind stealth if you haven't.
---
It's a good mainhand for dual wield tanking, that being said there might be better things out there, I haven't really dug that deep into the ins and outs of it, but due to the 2.9 second attack speed, it wouldn't be very good for tanking with a shield. For that you want something quite fast, 2 seconds or less preferably.
---
Personally I'm not interested in killing people 1v1 - just staying alive long enough for help to arrive, and doing what I can to get their HP down a bit if I'm in a safe enough position to do so.
---
I am curious where your talent points are, though? Things like Imp Inner Fire and reduced cast time on Mana Burn I'd definitely take, along with the standard ones. This is what I'm doing right now - https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/500132133525101-2050510303
---
The only thing that could change is possibly taking 3 out of Inspiration and putting that into Spell Warding for 6% less damage from casters.
---
But in terms of other places to go, check out Hydramist on Twitch and Youtube. He's a great PvP Disc Priest. In the UK so streams daytime UK hours.
---
Guarantee this gets removed because meme/not labeled as gripe, but yea this is big true
---
Mostly for WPvP and solo runs where I can sap a boss add and nuke down the boss - not to mention that it's such a nice quality of life improvement. Honestly, I've been doing pretty good without MoD but I see your point.
---
I don't think serrated blades is good enough on it's own without Hemo, and if I go Hemo then I need to respec out of improved SS which means I have to waste talents on dodge% talents so i'm not too happy about that.
---
I may drop the whole ambush thing eventually and reallocate 5 points into MoD and 3 points elsewhere but for now I like having a solid opener that isn't cheap shot.
---
Improved Kick is a consideration that I had not considered but that would require I sacrifice either Malice, weapon expertise or aggression.
---
What do you think about about weapon expertise vs crit vs aggression for my last points.
---
Thats cus current content is a joke... and if you're part of a HC guild trying to push parses, execution, etc on WCL then it's a diff story.
---
True, but it's extremely likely they're going to wrap it up in the usual maintenance window. It makes a lot of sense from an IT perspective of spinning up new services or clients, whatever it may be that is needed.
---
I wouldn't wear that as a hunter. If I'm getting hit in melee, I've failed.  And yeah, 30 bars? Not a chance. Rather farm Dreamscales.
---
Well the point is, there was a version of google (being thottbot) back then, which basically spread the information.
---
We're in an era of wow, where people have a lot more access to information. So even asking someone else, there's always the chance they alt-tab and literally look it up. (I do this often enough as I couldn't remember the crafting recipie for some things)
---
A far right white supremacy sub..
---
What server?
---
Yeah no, not for a pug. For a guildy I understand passing a minor upgrade if it's a major upgrade for them, but definitely not for a pug.
---
I logged on all the time at 2-5 am (like, every day for a week or so) and there were always horde there on Kromcrush. I did this about a month ago when lots of people were still hitting 60 though. Absolutely insane quest line on high pop pvp servers.
---
Authority is moving aswell
---
Flamelash is dead for real
---
This is the *second* release of this game, and there are *shit-tons* of resources out there.
---
When people ask dumb questions online or in chat, they should be told to google/wowhead the answers.  They're only asking because they're super fucking lazy.
---
You are grimy and if you're on Bigglesworth NA 1v1 me nerd, put a 100g on it you couldn't beat me lmao keep talkin.
---
Was that the expectation 15 year ago? Why is/why isn't that the expectation today?
---
They were already confirmed...
---
40
---
Maybe go to dm trough dm e entrance north of mojache? U need to die once but u spned literally 5 min max getting into whichever dm u want it is never camped by ally or horde on golemmag
---
Obviously if the 10th is reset day it mean on the 10th how are you all so dense?
---
LookingForGroup is the actual channel name, not LFG.
---
Totally agree and its partly why Im playing solo. Altho, sometimes certain things are hard to do solo so i struggle.
---
Any relaxed guilds on Golemagg EU ?
---
Your reply couldn’t be more perfect 😹😹😹
---
You could always level up a new mage for pvp. It takes like 4 days for mages to get to 60 with their private spellcleave groups.
---
I have the same concerns, currently leveling a warlock, I have tailoring and enchanting. Dropping both and going for mining and engineering. Engineering seems almost required due to PVP on my server and mining will be good to maximize Dire Maul farming. Easy for me to level than herb as I can smelt to 135 mining
---
If your shaman is tanking, which actually works better than you'd think with the right gear
---
ClassicThreatMeter and Details Tinythreat share the same libraries so as long as both are current versions you could use either. 
---
ThreatPlates is awesome as a tank. 
---
-	Make sure you configure it as tank and select your colours 
---
-	there are several ways to choose bow threat is calculated and shown. I find it to be pretty accurate 
---
-	you can see all the Debuffs on mobs you need including accurate banish timers
---
-	it works with other tanks in your Raid if they have it setup
---
No I didn’t write it but I find it immensely useful. Especially in either large packs of mobs to make sure no breakaways or calling shots on banishes.
---
I think its moer along the lines of I don't like PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPvP
---
Idk my end all be all is I dont want to have to spend 2 days straight logging in to WoW to farm ZF to support respeccing... Fun &gt; This ideal economy you speak of.
---
We get it, you think you should be able to use the R and N word without consequence.
---
Thats understandebly unscrupulous, but horde cities are exponentially harder to defend. Taking ironforge and downing the faction leader is probably one of the single hardest pvp objectives in wow, so in this case i condone the use of multiboxing to give an edge in an already incredibly unfair situation.
---
IMO Priority is: Tanks &gt; Rogues &gt; Fury Warriors.
---
I say this because fury warriors (if they aren't planning on tanking), already have an AOE ability in their rotation (whirlwind) where rogues are severely lacking one. Blade fury is a thing, but Thunderfury adds more into this.
---
Not a dick move, if tanks have it, and you are willing to spend it on it, go for it.
---
Why do you ply on a pvp realm if you don't live pvp? No one ever fucking said world pvp was fair or anything like that. Some people enjoy it some don't. That is why there are pve servers.
---
YouTube "melderon shaman leveling guide". This will be way more in depth than any comment here. As solo elemental, basically searing totem, Mana spring only if the fight is more than 20 seconds.
---
No... it would say Unique-Equipped if that was the case
---
All I see is a mentally unstable neckbeard upset that he can’t spew bullshit without consequence.
---
what does fcs stand for?
---
Yeah our OT is feral and he doesn't really need oh shit buttons. Sounds like yours may need better gear or a better spec
---
There's no issue in this screenshot
---
Unless your a goblin engineer :)
---
Paladins. Even as a druid in PvP.... GIMMIE A PALADIN BESIDE ME.
---
You're supposed to feel sorry for turning WoW into a book report.
---
&gt;Eventually we are all going to bump assholes.
---
\*shudder\*
---
But otherwise, yeah.  I have seen very little loot drama personally.  No more than could be explained by knowing you are bound to run into jerks now and then.  And most people are very happy to help out new players if they have questions and are just up front about not knowing something.
---
Yeah no ty I'm trying to avoid this thing called burnout, which I've been approaching already with the current state of wPvP and grinding while waiting for BGs lol
---
Ya that's another aspect too. Adapting my example, it would be like if someone asked "Can anyone help me find \[x\]?" in a public place with multiple people standing or walking around, and considering that to be rude. 
---
And ya I get it if you're getting asked, not because that person is being rude, but because of our likely experiences of being asked often by various people. After so many years, you sometimes can't help but be annoyed. Yet that has nothing to do with some sort of social faux pas being committed by the newb, and has more to do with our own negative experience with repeating ourselves.
---
Lmao you can't be serious. The sub is literally for calling out censorship and double-standards on reddit.
---
Found 3 level 40-42 botters in Dustwallow Marsh last night. Managed to pull the ally (enemy faction) one to Brackenwall Village before it's owner got back.
---
The horde ones were a little tougher to deal with as I couldn't attack them and there was no obvious way to mess with them. The only way I found to grief them was to pull the level 43 caster mobs that do an AoE up from the south part of the zone.
---
I like pvp. Being corpsecamped by a 5-man isn't pvp.
---
Yes it's for honor farming, have you not noticed that these players are very high in rank by now?
---
Talk shit get hit
---
Cuz i can sinister everywhere on her side but have to backstab nearly her back
---
Just facts lol
---
And somehow:  
---
convince a guild to feed you MC gear/a 2h weap that would otherwise go to a warrior or even a ret pally
---
get in range of any decent pvper to be able to global them
---
pray to RNG gods for big dick WF proc
---
sure, hand of rag enh shammies can probably do this. but thats what, 1 - 4 people per server? lol
---
Ooph, that's rough buddy. 
---
...At the same time, we probably shouldn't assume that everyone in these comments who is taking that side of things is doing it to the same degree that your ex was. Like, that stuff with your ex sounds horrible. 
---
Then again, yeah the guy literally saying "have conversations on your own time" seems about as narcissistic as it gets, so maybe the comparison is warranted in that case.
---
Even though i would fking hate u for that its ok; dunno why these morons think its griefing
---
Monster energy drink
---
Probably more efficient to not to do that last shock and auto attack till mob is dead to allow Mana Regen if you are chain pulling mobs.
---
&gt; Fair enough. It's just surprising to me that someone could enjoy vanilla but have such a non vanilla view on gear. This is the version of wow known for bad itemization, classes wearing mismatched weird gear etc.
---
When i played vanilla it was the view people had, at least the people i played with. 
---
Also, many of my less gamer friends who has joined for classic, dont know anything about this shit and are joyfull ignorant.
---
Hell, this entire thread is about people not knowing everything, and that it is ok :)
---
&gt; That's completely fine if you want to gimp your character to stay in one armor type, 
---
I never said that - I said I would pass if other needed it.
---
&gt; but you have to understand that it is not optimal and other players want their optimal gear, and should roll and use their optimal gear. 
---
Most plate/mail classes have optimal gear that is not plate/mail, that's just how the game was made. You can think it's bad design and I mostly agree, but don't get upset about it, its not changing ever.
---
I'm not upset, I am not asking for any changes, and I completely understand why people feel that they should have prio on that gear. Just like i understand why people feel its ok to need on BoE epics for selling. I just dont agree to that mindset.
---
Imagine this people as jews in ww2. DONT KILL ME MR. ITS NOT FAIR!!
---
And it wasnt. It was Belgiums fault for renegging on the initial defense plan.
---
We had 4 today ( cuz we have 4 raid )
---
True but if alliance got gnomer instead of darnassus northern kalimdor would be a lot more red.
---
You realize tons of products have soy in them right? You sound very upset too. Relax a bit.
---
Coffee bruh
---
I know melee LOVE windfury, but sadly, paladin buffs are just so strong, and their utility (BoF, BOP, DS) is just too nuts to pass up on.
---
Incredibly unfair situation? Horde has every other advantage in the world. Ally boats are literally camped 24/7 and ally can't reciprocate since you get knocked off the platform. But poor horde has a tough time making it up the ramp so you condone breaking TOS and cheating?
---
Imagine purposely labeling yourself as the bottom image
---
Sounds like Internet Explorer
---
Most private servers didn't wait to release BGs that is the only reason why you see this difference. Right now in classic you have no choice but to so wpvp for honor on private most people were doing BGs
---
Join /LookingForGroup also, it's the official channel
---
&gt; This has nothing to do with laziness
---
&gt; I just don't want to spend all that time
---
Mhmm
---
They all left today
---
Absolutely agree. That's how it was back in Vanilla too. I feel like there's a kind of 'purity' to it, so to speak, trying to make the most of what little bits of talent points/spells/what have you that you have available to do as much as you can.
---
I enjoy the thrill of that personally.
---
I’m considerably more likely to gank gnomes more than any other alliance race.
---
Sure!  But then if you're part of a HC guild doing that stuff, you should be able to afford the gold to respec as well.
---
Asking other people IS doing research
---
I am on Blameaux also, it is quite the nightmare for us. Mara still seems to get some attention, especially for princess runs. ST is coming up for you but nobody does it. Once you hit 50/51 you could prob do Arena and Anger runs
---
so what you're saying is you played on a dead pvp server at launch then. 
---
because clearly not blackrock.
---
Oh, I'm a hunter. So, as the mage's fireball was mid-flight, I'd use Arcane Shot to get the tag. The mage would then target a new mob, and I'd tag that in the same way. Sometimes it would target a third mob, othertimes (I'm assuming because no third mob was close enough) it would then stand there and try its rotation on the 2nd mob. If I pulled agro accidentally, I would just feign death.
---
oof
---
How exactly are you getting more damage with MH over Quel, as fury prot? None of our abilities scale with weapon damage.. And surely the stats don't make up the rare to epic difference in dps.
---
Really wish Druids could wear this.
---
Theres a guy who made an ele shaman pvp video recently "Bra the Ele" I think. He uses this chest piece to some comic effect.
---
But you won’t be using it will you? You just swap to it when the call happens and then instantly switch back?
---
Here’s some solutions you whiny fuckin bitch. It’s like you idiots don’t even understand this:
---
go to another instance/area, get a little help from other players in-zone, join a large raid pvp group, join a small pvp group, make your way to the instance together as an instance group, ask a friend for help, stop playing for a bit, ask your guild
---
No matter how much you tools gripe, no one’s going to change for you.
---
we used to queue from darn for PVP in vanilla because there was never any lag and there was no one there to spy on how much honor we were grinding
---
The hammer is good for tank paly or druid tank
---
I bet you 100 g I couldn't beat you
---
Fixed it by body pulling with pet instead of dmg
---
Why did you join a pvp server? This was obviously something that would happen?
---
You're title and body require two different answers, which are you trying to do? Level an alt or farm gold?
---
If you're leveling an alt just do whatever is level appropriate for the alt.
---
If you need gold then do proven farms like princess.
---
The only racials in PvE that matter are the hit boosts that humans Sword/Maces and Orc axes gives. Other than that, the math is done for Gnome casters. 5% boost to base int is near useless, I think it was calculated to add just a handful of frostbolts. 
---
Racials are overrated in PvE.
---
And it is PVP = player vs player. Doesn't matter if it's 1vs60000 or 1vs1
---
I always start close to her head and slowly move to her back until i can backstab him
---
I can't answer the question about how good it is for rogues. But I can tell you some other stuff, most of which you probably already know.
---
Those bindings are *rare*. Back in vanilla retail, I knew of several guilds that farmed MC every week for well over a year and never got a matched set to drop. The fact that your guild somehow has two pairs complete already is kind of mindboggling, honestly. But that's still no guarentee of you ever seeing the other half once you spend points on the first half. So there's a risk.
---
The second point I was going to raise is how big of a pain 100 arcanite is. But if you're a third they there already then I'd say you have a pretty good idea.
---
The third thing worth pointing out is using TF in BGs puts a big target on your back. The sword is huge.
---
For sure. Instead of flat out explaining everything to someone, you could direct them to a useful resource like some videos they could watch or a website. Then they can their own research.
---
only person i aint willing to bet money on is a proper SL lock... rest can get the smoke
---
We realize there are people behind those screens, we just think they're stupid people that like to complain instead of solve their own problems, that's all.
---
This was super common when i played WSG in vanilla; did it myself all the time.  Never got a ban or a warning.
---
It depends on context. Some people expect a lot, but do not put out much in return. But on the flip side, some guilds, particularly the megaguilds that recruit constantly by spamming everyone with invites, are fairly impersonal places. In such a case, the guild is not much more than a private LFG chat channel, and if nobody's even using that...why be in the guild?
---
It's hard to say which this person is, because I don't know 'em, but it does seem likely that this person is a poor fit for this guild.
---
It's not bis at this phase. Once the 25 agi enchant is out it will be.
---
Are you talking about warlocks in pve spec?
---
Because warlocks in pve spec loses to everything.
---
I feel for you, man. 
---
Who will you heroes 5v1 now?
---
You can only restore once every 15 days though.
---
so are nameplates, i wasn't serious buddy
---
Saw this exact same thing in Winterspring. Hunter just roving around, sending pet and auto attacking until they find a new mob...ugh.
---
Yes it’s fine. It’s kind of a jerk move, but it’s expected and part of the experience. Only care bears legitimately complain about this. 
---
Camping someone mercilessly for no reason, then taunting them for being upset is peak stupidity. The correct response is always to log out and not give the camper the satisfaction, as they’re clearly a jackass IRL.
---
Somehow i just got the point that i hate alliance so much i can't even help myself, i like the thought of them getting extremely angry behind their computer
---
Depends on server, but I've had a bad time finding groups as a healer too. Despite resto spec on shaman, I ended up as DPS roughly \~50% of the time while levelling.
---
It means you're wrong
---
What do you do when you get ganked? Just stand there?
---
What casual is at level 57 and still doesn't know how to dismiss their pet? If you're a casual and level 57 it's because you got caught up reading speed leveling guides and forgot to actual play the game.
---
WF only affects your MH so you can still ench your OH and gain the full benefit.
---
Was this experience in wetlands on heartseeker?
---
That's the cost for pursuing the play style you want. I think that's appropriate.
---
Because the honor system used the same verbage, but released the following Thursday instead?
---
&gt;  Its a mentality stemming from retail. 
---
Bullshit. The pala's of my guild back in vanilla wore cloth, but they also had to wait for offspec rolls for it. You may say I was in a shitty guild, and you might be right. 
---
If anything this BiS mentality stems from private servers.
---
I feel it's very safe to say that mileage will very with this buggy quest and the safe bet is to keep your disguise on in the town, fight his target and only his target when you get outside of the town, don't release when you are down at the tower until Tirion shows up.  I say this as someone who was more than happy to just afk auto follow him for the completion but failed trying to do as I read was the way to do it.  Again, this quest is buggy and mileage will vary, if you can't afk the whole thing then just attack his target and you'll be fine.
---
Funny how you don’t understand irony.
---
I called that a mundane question. Good reading comprehension
---
You have to be in the best guild in the server otherwise you get tailed. 2nd is not an option.
---
&gt; Dunno if streamers have perpetuated this or what.
---
As someone who played Vanilla (well before streaming was a thing), it definitely is not a recent phenomenon.  There have always been a segment of players who think that the point of joining a guild is so they personally can get carried through harder content.  These people are generally not worth keeping around, in my opinion.  
---
That said, there are some times when these types of complaints are warranted.  Sometimes you get players who *have* received a ton of help, but who are miraculously always busy when someone asks them for something.
---
Because my friends are the kind of idiots with a "Hurr durr, we have to play on a pvp server, that's what men do" attitude and then leave the game after a month.
---
Program in more damage and heals if we're outnumbered in a fight, you're not going to balance the populations ever, at least make fighting less pointless for alliance.
---
Grow up, Zoomer. Expecting other people to be miserable in a game they pay for so that you can have fun at their expense is narcissistic at best and outright braindead at worst.
---
Dude wtf
---
and after thousands of years they still can't build a HOUSE WITH  PROPER WALLS FFS
---
So you rather have 1 rogue do more damage than the rest of the raid?
---
We have 40 minute clear so your clear time literally doesn't matter.
---
The good news is, we only have to wait until phase 5 for our bis fury gear to consist entirely of plate armor.
---
Let's say it like this: can a good SL warlock shut down druid, shaman or priest healer or he is helpless against them?
---
Yeah but we are ok with cross server BG queues right away. Amiright horde?
---
Isn't mining useful for DME and the guaranteed rich thorium?
---
As disc or holy? Whats your strategy?
---
:DDDDDDDDDD  
---
 OK BOOMER
---
Because I just don't care about the bis to perfectly curate my groups around it. I don't mind running BRD. For you it might be a waste but I don't see it as such.
---
There is a huge difference between those behaviors,  and it’s so frustrating when you come up against the people that are entitled and in leadership positions.
---
Grr
---
Tell your friend to summon a voidwalker. I don’t understand how a warlock could ever lose to a warrior if you don’t just stand there with an imp out wanding. 
---
Deathcoil, dot and kite. If he gets on you, sac voidwalker and spam searing pain/drain life if pummel gets used or he’s out of rage. Once your shield goes down, fel dom into another voidwalker. 
---
On my warrior even if I kill the warlock 99% I’ll just die to his dots even through eating.
---
stfu dog
---
It's so difficult because not even the npc's follow the law.
---
As the player being camped has no way to retaliate I think PV would be a better way to call it.
---
RIP no target of target.
---
Yeah, I'd rather practice vs the real thing and having to deal with and use nades. Iron grenades aren't crazy expensive, I've already used hundreds of them, anyway
---
You have 2 options:  
---
\-don't group with people so you don't fuck them because you are lazy;
---
\-play solo and no one fucking cares.   
---
Thanks this was my tedtalk on how to solve your fucking (imaginary) problems.
---
Don’t be right, you will get down voted ... oh $hi+
---
That one alliance server isn't gonna save the horde. Expect massive queues for horde players.
---
herb
---
Some people prefer to play blind, where as some people don’t feel like teaching others
---
Ignore him tbh.
---
If a random guildie is running a dungeon, I won't go unless I need something from there.
---

---
5k unbuffed, 6k buffed. more than many warriors.
---
in a hypothetical scenario when facing a warrior/rogue you don't fear or "peel" the warrior or rogue, you fear the pally (assuming bubble already popped, why else would they have peeled to you at that point), i've yet to die to a rogue or warrior, geared or not, in a situation like that. incredibly tanky + large health pool + DoTs ticking away + LIP is 6 fucking seconds where they aren't damaging you + healthstone + drain life while LIP'd....I mean dude the list goes on. Even if the pally breaks out of fear the felhunter is still on them for a what 8 second school lockout on holy? 
---
&gt; Plus, it’s not like Paladins can’t hang with a Warlocks Damage in terms of healing. 
---
why would you think a SL warlock would out damage a hpal healing themselves? where did I say this? the pally will either be CC"d to death or will go OOM dispelling curses. you know what curse of tongues is right? 60% slower heals = plenty of time to stop a heal. it gets dispelled? great keep applying it and drain mana, pally will be oom fast
---
&gt; Also, you can’t say you’re going to silence a Paladin and sac a Voidwalker, doesn’t compute. There’s not way you’re getting through the summons in a team fight. 
---
Why is everyone responding actually have no fucking clue at all what a SL warlocks kit is like? You can either pre-sac VW and summon felhunter or pre-sac VW fel dom summon felhunter. if you really get focused you can DS the felhunter, fel dom VW sac. also summon time is what 5 seconds I think for SL? not impossible to fall back, resummon felhunter after, and go back in. 
---
&gt; Plus, Paladins have a 15% chance to resist a silence you throw at them. It’s not likely but not uncommon either. 
---
so...recast fear? 1.5 sec cast 24yd range isn't exactly a huge problem if it gets resisted 
---
&gt; Sure, Warlocks May be hard for Paladins to deal with if they are harassed uninhibited but it isn’t happening. What’s the first rule of PvP? Protect the healer. 
---
and by bringing 1, 2, even 3 people away from somewhere else to deal with the warlock locking down the hpal, the warlock did his job. might not even die if his team comes.
---
I'm more likely to gank mages and rogues whenever I have the opportunity,  especially gnome ones
---
I find that most people are reasonable and inbetween.
---
As a mage I've been to a few SM runs where someone says something like 'are you ok with aoe cleave run?' and i say i don't even have imp blizzard and they just say 'ok', no abuse..
---
People just generally want things to benefit them (fast run, rules where they get the gear drops, etc.) - as long as they're not assholes about it, I understand
---
All I'm asking you is to reconsider his words.l and look beyond yourself to the bigger picture. Nobody said anything or made mention to an "ideal" economy.
---
Gold sinks are necessary to be in the game in order to prevent inflation. If you think about it. Gold is constantly being printed in the game without many meaningful ways to take it out of the game. Every drop from a mob, every herb picked, and every ore mines is money being created.
---
Sure you may be paying plenty of money for a valuable BoE epic but that money only gets transferred to a different player not taken out of the game. When was the last time you ever bought anything from an actual npc vendor?
---
At the end game this is a solid way to control inflation.
---
I'm guessing because wowhead says it's BiS. Therefore no other gear is worth having lol. I don't get it either. I've been rocking Aquementas, and will upgrade in AV like a smart person.
---
I would not use DHC over the xbow unless I was a dwarf. The fire damage is frequently immuned and can also break your scatters.
---
Happened before. I dont need validation dont worry
---
As a new joiner, the best way to get guildies to help out is to help them first.  If you start to notice a pattern of non-reciprocation, then you know it's time to start looking for a new guild.
---
I mean I just want to be able to be competitive in both Pve and PvP without having to break the bank every week for it lol... and even more so when we raid multiple days a week with more raids out...
---
be undead
---
as a fury warrior I relate to this meme in dungeons, but in the raid it's the opposite. no matter how much I want the plate, it's always prioritized to tanks. so here I am who knows how many weeks into raiding with only a strikers mark bow and a bunch of leather from dungeons
---
So you had to kill the first mob by yourself (because the bot moved on), but the second mob (that you still tagged first) would sometimes be fought by the bot (unless there was a third mob around)? So you can essentially get 2 mobs for the price of fighting only one yourself?
---
Most locks level as affliction. Drain tanking is pretty common, where you DoT a target and Life Drain as it attacks you. Usually paired with a succubus for offtanking/cc/damage.
---
I leveled Destro back in vanilla retail. Good damage, but you'll pull threat off your VW immediately *all* the time, and your mana efficiency isn't very good.
---
Human sorry ...
---
that's correct. google alpha iron forge if you want to know more. somebody made a video explaining how old iron forge and old gnomeregan would be connected
---
That was super fun. You gained a lot of respect from our side last night.
---
Naxx :(
---
No offense but you sound like you’re shite at making gold.
---
"Sorry kids I know it's Friday but I need to you to stay late and research videos on Allan Park Junior High's previous games so we can get the competitive advantage"
---
&gt; Tell your friend to summon a voidwalker. I don’t understand how a warlock could ever lose to a warrior if you don’t just stand there with an imp out wanding.
---
I don't know what warriors others face but warriors we are facing have deathbringers, or BRE's, and hit like trains. Trying to get a voidwalker out when a warrior is already on you, is a tall task. Blowing your cooldown to summon one in 0.5 is great, except it can be pummeled and has been, on more than one occasion. This also doesn't take into account if there's an enemy healer in the vicinity, in which the felhunter would be much more useful than a sacrifice shield would be.
---
You're the clown in the last image that everyone is laughing at. Clown makeup streams down with your angry tears.
---
Lmao dude probably walked away from the keyboard after that
---
No, I don’t think it does. I read the new EULA, there is no mention of collusion like in the original one. People keep throwing this myth around
---
Vendors for 50 silver wtf
---
Just use Puggle and use the keybind to automatically track/not track the lfg requests
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/puggle
---
If this wasn't ironic in the slightest, work on that pretentiousness and projection. It's a bad look.
---
I would probably just stick to Herod, if you end up wanting to main your warrior I'm sure you'll appreciate having a 60 mage to farm gold on since as far as I've heard warriors aren't very good at it, besides 2 man jump runs once you're geared enough, but that still requires a 2nd person. I play a pally on Herod, I never really had a big problem with the faction imbalance until honor came out, and I'm hoping things die down a ton once BGs come out.
---
I don't think I can get to the DM East Thorium veins from DM North without having to solo the instance. And I don't think a Hunter can solo DM E (at least not at the g/h rate DM N has).
---
We have a lot of hardcore harries on our server.
---
Triendra is in my guild. 
---
Kids a legend.
---
They can get there solo without any problems.
---
Bad mod
---
Stay triggered, coward.
---
This here is the solution.
---
I mean I'm not a God who knows how to manipulate the AH to make a shit ton of money with little effort unlike the millionaires in wow... but I can and have made 1k gold in the span of 2 days when i put my head down so I don't think I'm awful either lol.
---
It depends. 
---
If you’re a horde warrior doing dps in pre bis with windfury; don’t. Crits, multi-hits, etc are all relatively common and will cause you to lose out on a lot of rage if they proc in battle stance.
---
Tanking? No. Use revenge.
---
Leveling? Absolutely. Overpower is broken during leveling especially if it’s improved.
---
Alliance warrior doing dps? Not sure but I’d say yes. Although you can still double hit with HOJ it’s less likely than with wfury and hoj. Crits are annoying though. 
---
Pvp? Yes. Burst &gt; rage management
---
Nah. I’m good. I’m just here to pass out hard to swallow pills for the people ITT that are deluding themselves. Ah, -6 and climbing. I guess I should have crushed them up for you guys.
---
Welcome to Azeroth:)
---
May your journey bring you joy and a shitload of epics!
---
I remember you are an undead priest i fucking slained in burning steppes with my rogue actually, get rekt
---
How many "Wish i would have moved" posts are we gonna be seeing in the following weeks?
---
&gt; As a casual player it would be nice to be able to freely choose which aspect of the game I can play
---
You can still choose this.  No one is saying you can't PvP as a Prot Warrior, or DPS as an AoE Farm spec'd Frost Mage.  You won't be the *best* at those things, sure.  But then, why should you get to be the best as a casual player, compared to people who sink 100 hours a week into the game?
---
The Free Character Moves will be closing:
---
* **US**: December 5th @ 11:00 a.m. PST
---
* **EU**: December 6th @ 1:00 a.m. CET
---
Looking forward to the regret posts over the next few months.
---
Might just be experience on different servers. I was one of the first ones on my server with all of those recipes (I paid 195g, 35g, and 35g for the three recipes, all of which were great deals at the time), and even then I was generally one of 3-4 blacksmiths who could make all of them. This was back in late September/early October for all except for the Thorium Shield Spike, which I didn't get until late October. For Mithril Shield Spike and Steel Weapon Chain, I had them both before I hit 60. 
---
In today's market, I know of 5-10 other blacksmiths who can make all of these. They're also almost always on the AH for sale (normally at a good price too) just because there's so much competition for crafting these items.
---
That's fair, but I personally resonate with simply being a mage who adapts to what I feel like playing. If I feel like Frost/Arcane, I'll do that, Frost/fire I'll do that, Fire/frost, I'll do that, etc...  I'm not attached to one spec
---
Well then I hope you don't complain about the quality of pugs because this is why good players dont pug
---
Unless you're getting the same group of people in BG's.
---
Lol now they are claiming they didn't know the difference between a pvp and a pve server?  And somehow that's everyone else's fault but their own.  This subreddit is such a joke.
---
*rolls on a PVP server*
---
WAOW WHADDYA MEAN PEOPLE WANT TO PVP ON A PVP SERVER, COME ON! THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO! BUGGED GAME MECHANICS!
---
Priest + mage has nothing to kill a druid. It's just not happening unless he's terrible.
---
Mage + priest was not a good 2s comp IIRC, it gets completely wrecked by lock + druid (and hunter + druid), while likely not beating druid + warrior easily either.
---
I do everything with this spec lol. More than enough for PvE healing right now - certainly no need for anything more unless you're less geared. I was full Holy for a bit, then 26/25, and now that I'm geared enough I'm just full Disc because I don't need the extra Holy PvE talents. But yes the spec is centered around PvP.
---
Horde come to Earthfury please!
---
Do not buy axe of the deep woods. Better item comes out in AV.
---
Flurry axe is only good if you don’t want to buy elemental sharpening stones. 
---
Lionheart helm is probably a great investment right now. Lot of people doing jump runs means thorium/sapphires/ACs are cheaper than they’ll ever be.
---
Otherwise, epic mount it is!
---
I wonder which is more important, regen mana or protecting health (because I didn't use mana to kill the mob faster)?
---
It's probably best to stop at 308 since that's when you practically (not completely of course) eliminate the glancing blow penalty. As others have mentioned the hit cap is lowered due to 315 skill, but it comes at the expense of having less DPS stats on your gear.
---
It's not very difficult to be hit capped for specials as a Rogue since you get 5% hit from talents, leaving you only needing 1% from gear.
---
This was 100% the case in Vanilla, I can't imagine it would be different in Classic.
---
Cool, they'll also get flamed rightfully and not re-invited for playing multiplayer games and ruining other people's fun because they were lazy enough to google.
---
It's literally pvp. Duels are for 1v1.
---
Dude tram to Darnassus, Ironforge connected to Gnomeregan, that wouldve been fucking amazing.
---
where do i go to transfer?
---
Only to characters over 110 I believe. My mage is 90 and still in happy darnassus
---
Possibly Fairbanks
---
Just roll a pvp server and u won’t want to play for long
---
Because people will tip generally and you get good standing with your server.
---
That’s exactly the look I was going for!
---
/moo
---
Take an L and move on.
---
He truly is, terrible name though
---
What was the name of your character
---
and demo shout debuffs and goes ahead when how many?  Like 5 mobs or more?  neither is great for holding any sort of threat but good off the pull for a very short period...like short
---
Love this addon
---
Excellent
---
Its BiS until aq40 for mages too.
---
Oh, I thought you made it out to sound like you lived in some kind of assisted care facility where it's someone else's job to lock the doors lol
---
You should be able to take on warriors and paladins 1v1. It takes a while but you out heal wars damage and burn a paladins mana. 
---
Maybe the feral druid that tried to gank me was bad, but I killed him every time if I was full health and buffed. If they go cat you can easily burst them with PI
---
I'd try posting in r/warcraftlore and see what they say there.
---
Says the person who has never pvp'd good in vanilla
---
This is why Nelf mages are banned in classic
---
The second option solves a lot of problems. Or wait until the Blizzard decides to start printing money in 2020 to boost 1st quarterly earnings with paid transfers. 
---
You can keep listening to complaints on Reddit too. P
---
That’s not true. SGC is still BIS in p5
---
I'm trying to get racists and Nazis to go mask-off.
---
That’s what I’m thinking, is your serpent sting more raid dps than a different debuff. Honestly with expanded debuff slots a lot more Spec’s would be viable
---
Is that allowed here?
---
It takes 5 minutes to get to them. You don't have to clear anything just walk.
---
I love the idea of rolling a warrior and sinking 13 hours a day into min/maxing and pvping my brains out. 
---
But I have a family now and maybe 13 minutes a day to play. I toss on a stream. Watch someone else do it for bits at a time. It fills a lot of my cravings.
---
Sounds like you need to roll a Nelf brother.
---
I’m currently on a hiatus from the game until the 10th when hopefully some of these clowns decide to get their jollies in BGs instead of killing level 50s trying to quest.
---
I’ve been accruing insane rested XP. Not playing is currently much better than doing so.
---
Well there you go, there's gold sinks that separate the best parsers from the average player. There's gold sinks that separate the best rankers from the average player. There's a gold sink that separates the two play styles. 
---
If it wasn't demanding to be the most prepared at what you're doing then it wouldn't be competitive.
---
Wow is a competitive game.
---
Yes, I did precisely this as well.
---
Yeah this is how I am. You kill me once, okay great that's what I signed up for that's no problem at all. But its the guys that just continue to camp and gank you that gets annoying real fast.
---
Oh I thought they were discussing the best classic wow 2v2 but if they are talking arena compositions that makes more sense.
---
Pvp has been cool, had a couple decent wins, a couple really dog wins, and had my arse handed to me on more occasions then I’d like to admit
---
Landing at a FP and being ganked by 20+ people that’s not pvp, but hey I might have missed the part in any of the newbie guides that said that was gunna happen, perhaps you can link me a guide that states that ?
---
Finally we have the answer!!!
---
"Just play better" yeah man I could totally outplay the 5 people ganking me at all times and kill them all. 1v1s are easy, too bad I never get any since phase 2 dropped.
---
For a guy who didn't know he could smelt, he seemed to go right to his general skills page in his spell book to find it without being prompted to do so
---
Look at mr moneybags with sunshafts on
---
I cannot for the life of me figure out how to transfer off my server. I didnt see any option in my bnet account, or in-game. I really want to leave my server... anyone know how to access this feature?
---
Same man, i cant do it to them
---
Paladins in pvp &gt; Shamans + horde racials
---
Yes the biggest. Big dog and meh are moving now too
---
Sorry for asking but what is LAP?
---
I think he means submit a ticket.
---
I was thinking I could probably take pallys while typing my last comment but I play ally so haven't had the chance to fight them yet since I don't duel yet. I know geared smite priests can put out good damage but, like I said, I'm waiting to afford respecs before really diving into pvp. I can remember a close fight with a warrior but I still lost however it was right after hitting 60 and didn't have any gear. My shields would drop quickly and I ran out of mana keeping myself up. Interrupts slowed me down so I had to heal more than I could dish out damage and went OOM.
---
Deviate delight makes you immune to her fear effect
---
I heard this is a good farming spot.  They are friendly to horde though.
---
I like it when a spec defines you (and me) as a character.  While dual-specs are a useful tool, they severely diminish the meaning of "specialization" when you can change spec every single fight.
---
The re-spec is still available for a price, and that's a perfectly acceptable compromise.
---
If you're a wolf, you'll starve without sheep. Wolves only take what they need lest the sheep move on to greener pastures and they are left with nothing.
---
And a little bit of this
---
Get in a premade when bgs are out, specially those aiming for rank 14, and im sure that might give you a challenge if you are that great of a player, or then again rogues also wreck anything while leveling up as well.
---
Look at aptechka
---
Rogues are the 4th most played class. There are significantly more warriors and mages, and slightly more priests. Data from https://ironforge.pro/servers?classes=true which gets its data from warcraftlogs
---
Target macros as in? Not sure what you’re referring to
---
Yea my post was a joke.. why are so many of you cunts on the fkn spectrum
---
That's hit cap for rogues.
---
For sure, if I have the answer, I am 100% going to give it to people. Telling someone to just "google it" isn't great.
---
I interact with people that's why I play classic.
---
With that said, I don't think it's unreasonable for people to be able to alt tab and look a few things up which lowers down a lot of the spam of "where's manarik's wife" popping up literally every 30 seconds, to "hey can anyone point me towards how to get on top of WC to pick up the quests?", or "has anyone seen Naz?"
---
Or druid
---
And do you think the Nazis are the mods, or the people who were banned for sharing stories of being victims of hate speech?
---
I had a mix of beaststalker, savage gladiator, and bloodmail items. Just stack stamina and crit really and still try to get to 5% hit. I don't think there really is a BIS gear for pvp hunter, just whatever play style or stuff you want to use. Now my set is more mixed with GS and sometimes I'll just roam around in my raid gear and melt people. Really just depends how I feel.
---
57s talk about 5 man epic mount teams corpse camping them like the honor divided is worth waiting for you to walk back. Chances are you rezed and continued doing what you're doing while they were still running loops and they caught you again. Congratulations, you learned nothing. Stop feeding
---
There are some bored people out there with plenty of money who could probably spend upwards of $300+ per month on extra accounts
---
It's clearly easy mode. That isn't a bad thing, though.
---
You need to keep running DB / flurry axe because it's a dps loss for you to use CHT without the dagger skill. If you get the Aged Core Leather Gloves *and* you use elemental sharpening stones on your offhand, then and only then would it be a DPS increase to use DB / CHT.
---
I played pvp servers before they weren’t anywhere close to this shit fest that’s going on
---
Agreed
---
Where do you get 11% as the hitcap for rogues lol
---
This server has been a ton of fun so far, the population is great and world PvP has been a blast! Definetly consider switching to Arcanite Reaper!
---
In game shop i think
---
Ok thanks for the reply I’ll keep at it for sure! What do I do about warlocks and shadow priests?
---
Yep, a 40 char multiboxer would never be able to win.
---
Its only Onyxia, calm down, just afk, im sure shell go down.
---
Or an important level difference ( or both)
---
Idk man, maybe because when you play the game you see 5 rogues/warriors/mages for every 1 of another class? Lol
---
Except grob I guess *shrugs*
---
I’ll be a ray of sunshine when I stop seeing low IQ whine threads
---
Our guild is going through this dilemma now. For the most part the people we've added are pretty self sufficient but we've got a couple people who are starting to rub the group of us who have been 60 the wrong way with constant requests to be run through dungeons. We're a relatively small guild that's part of a raid alliance so we only have a dozen or so 60's at this point so we don't always have a group for a 5-man online and ready to go. They've been lucky enough to be leveling at the same rate as one of our tanks so far, but they seem to have the expectation that we're able to summon a run with space for them at will.
---
Playing devil's advocate, I realize it's hard to break into a guild where a lot of the members have been playing together for years, but I think there's a certain amount of social capital that you need to build up before asking for favors. Just jumping into Discord and chatting with people or offering to tag along to help with something you don't need counts for a lot. We've got people who are pretty new but helpful or just aren't great players but fun to talk to that will always get help if they ask for something and that's one thing that seems to separate the two groups.
---
I’d like to do both at the same time. While I’m boosting my alt, I’d like to make as much gold as possible
---
What a waste of time
---
Lol, i'm a tank/resto druid, no one wants my gear. ;)
---
I think it’s 5% for most special abilities with a 8-9% cap for auto swipes.
---
Nvm, looked it up, the mounts are the expensive part. But looking online I can't find for certain what the mount from AV will cost. Some spots say 800g, others have it for 10g, or just the AV tokens, so no clue what it will be.
---
We have 2 rogues that are there 24/7 in IF that do this. Pop out of stealth, wrech a clothie, get killed, do the same thing 3 mins later. Repeat that literally all night long.
---
I believe (and somebody please correct me if I am mistaken) the durability loss is not incurred if the individual is engaged in PvP combat at the time of death
---
Yeah I noticed this while leveling, but I was impatient most the time :/
---
&gt;  low IQ
---
The Dunning-Kruger effect is strong with this one.
---
They were [banned for sharing hate speech](https://i.imgur.com/2IzY7iz.png).
---
Are you calling them victims now? lmao.
---
Leatrix Plus has an option for this. If you cast a spell or try to use a flight it will auto dismount.
---
RIP
---
Lol this sub is such trash
---
Oh, yes, I had immediately submitted two tickets (as the amount of space they give you to report something is incredibly limited), as well as contacted an officer from their guild
---
So you’re arguing against people alt-tabbing for a quick google search for their questions, because google didn’t tell you how to effectively pvp as a hunter?
---
I'm assuming OP is on a PvP server, in which you can only have characters on 1 faction. For PvE servers you are correct, you can have toons on both factions.
---
Just curious, but in the video you linked the mobs aren’t using the net that they always kill me with when I try this, do you know if it was patched to add the nets?
---
HAHAHAHA a fucking mage asking for this, like i have sympathy for healers/tanks but fucking mage! HA!
---
Or the classic wrath with DF but no cross realm for DF
---
Honor at its finest
---
Downvote me all you want but here is what I don't get. If you roll on a PVP server and look at the phases you should EXPECT Phase 2 to be a clusterfuck in terms of world PVP. Once BG's are added it wont be an issue anymore as people will grind won't BG's for honor.
---
I guarantee that past Phase 3 people are going to look back and post shit like "Since BG's were introduced there is no world PVP, servers are dead" - just like there was in classic.
---
Reality is, if you rolled on a PVP server you do so knowing there is a risk of being camped, ganked and killed.   
---
You could have just rolled PVE/RP server instead of complaining on a subreddit all day.
---
NOT a melee class, but the general consensus I heard was 2/2 Devilsaur or 0/2 Devilsaur. Look for the best non-Devilsaur gloves you can, or wait for T1 gloves?
---
I have been followed many times into the cauldron. Its a good way to save your group - go ahead first and lead them on a wild goose chase while your team gets away
---
Funny but clearly staged.
---
EU resets one day after (wednesdays) and we get BGs the same day as NA.
---
You can kill the mobs in AV for xp if you're into that sort of thing.
---
i never played on PvP realm, had no idea they got different rules there.
---
I didn't really think it's farmable, I did try it couple of times (like 5) and I didn't have any problems running through it. It just seemed like it's almost impossible to farm
---
What is the link to the discord
---
Noggenfogger Alliance only exists on wednesdays and sundays, rest of the time capitals completely deserted. In just 3 weeks AH shrinked from 25k average items to 13k.
---
*He got a full tanking set in 3 weeks with this one weird trick.*
---
I disabled pretty much all of the elvui skins and disabled the unit frames so everything aside from the elvui stuff you see in the ss is vanilla. Then I installed wuf unit frames because I like the wow ui unit frames better and I think the player/target frames function better
---
I wish, I would level my alt this way. In retail you get a good amount of exp for winning BGs, but sadly not classic.
---
Nifty stopwatch
---
I mean you're limited to whatever is most ideal for the alt, unfortunately shadowpriest isnt awesome at soloing dungeons outside of particular fights you can cheese.
---
The OranThul disbanded because they could not kill Vael on Northdale.
---
I’ve been wanting to re-roll alliance. Friends had me go horde but they all quit. Unsure which class but my old main was a pally. Thinking of rolling one again but gold making seemed like an issue. What spec do they use for all that stuff? What do they farm to make gold. Any additional insight is appreciated.
---
Durability loss is still granted if the killing low was a NPC. 
---
You still lose durability from fighting in pvp at a slower rate. None lost on death from a player killing blow.
---
What if the person wanting to run it was doing so out of a need for righteous orbs?
---
It's okay to be new, and to not know what you're doing. But I feel like a lot of frustration could be saved by people asking questions more. I understand there are some people that give newbies grief for asking questions, but I think most people would rather you speak up.
---
As an example, I'm a veteran of the game but I certainly don't have every class pre BIS list memorised. But all you really need is a general idea of *your* BIS. I keep it on a browser when I'm running specific dungeons. 
---
So when I was running a dungeon with a guildie the other day, a cloth item dropped that would be a minor upgrade for me. My guildie hit need right away. Knowing it wasn't *my* BIS, I asked if he minded if I rolled, and he said it was his BIS. So I passed, and no one ended up with bad feelings.
---
Good luck, make a macro for friendlies so they don't try to "help". My advice is to do it 2:00-4:00am server time.
---
I think playing on a server where other people can kill you and not expecting since significant number of them to try to do that constantly regardless of whether it's directly contributing to their own character power to be extreme naive about human nature in online games in general.
---
But yeah, you got the rest of it right.
---
BACKSTAB
---
And years to fix any new bugs introduced by the change.
---
Elkanos(?) Buff bars are what I use above my frame for the cvbar look like elvui that when I hit 60 will just show consumes/procs
---
Look at you, little adorable ally, pretending that your faction is completely innocent of doing the exact same shit.  
---
You're so cute.
---
Not wanting to spend time doing something does not always equal laziness, dude.
---
Plus, I also think its completely stupid and tone deaf when you are talking about laziness in context to a video game.
---
It will be like phase 1 again.
---
Thank you for the clarifications! Much appreciated!
---
I understood that reference.
---
That's just how its always been. People complained even in the early days. Don't expect it to change. I do agree it sucks. Are you a warrior by chance?
---
I'm horde on Noggenfogger. Is it really that bad? Always thought I've seen a decent amount of ally around but I haven't seen any actual numbers.
---
Rank 13 Dwarf Priest here from Vanilla
---
In PVP gear (rank 10 gear) you are a little annoying ball of shit to kill. If you are PVP specced. And can avoid interrupts well. Classic is great because classes have 1 interrupt. Unlike retail, where each class has about 4 interrupts with a very small CD
---
Your place to shine is 1-3 people sitting on you trying to kill you. While your team kills them. This is doubled with Rank 13 gear. But if your opponents have the same gear, doesn't matter.
---
Can't ignore Priests either. Because they have some serious CC abilities and can do a little bit of burst. This was 100x more true in TBC/Wrath (I miss you rocket gloves)
---
My only thought is that mining is easier initially as you can smelt all the way to 135 skill. I just think the competition for thorium veins is insane and no class can solo DME right?
---
Afaik defense does nothing in pvp
---
As a casual Horde player on Flamelash I'm kinda shocked to see this happening so sudden. Getting forced to take my leave aswell. Any good alternate servers being recommended as of now?
---
If I use the fight club excel document I get around 2% DPS increase from switching Flurry to CHT in offhand and switching gloves from Flameguard guantlets to Edgemasters while having Deathbringer in MH.
---
HEARTSEEKER HORDE NEEDS YOU.
---
I had friends back in TBC who rolled a new character in the same class with a different spec. There’s always that route you can take, then just have one PvE mage and one PvP mage.
---
Which you’re free to post to back up this claim
---
Zug zug lil bitch
---
Do mages have trainers in Darnassus in retail?
---
Jumping the gate?  Yes.  The stuff where he acts special for standing in an easily accessible area?  No.
---
&gt;If you rolled horde for WOTF or dwarf for fear ward, you know exactly what I mean. 
---
Right here. I was Horde during TBC/Wrath days. I knew Horde would outnumber Alliance for Classic, so I decided to roll Alliance on a balanced-ish server. Since I wanted to play a priest, I \*had\* to pick Dwarf. I'd rather not, but I can't leave Fear ward on the table knowing better.
---
If we assume lock or spriest got the same skill/gear level/cooldowns ready .... youll die. If u dont believe me watch pro tournsments and youll see its like 90% lock/spriest whos winning. But u you can beat pretty much every other class and almost no duel is like this assumption. Most players will lack some kind of gear, awareness, experience etc.. use every advantage u can get and youll be able to win almost every fight. 
---
And go level up engineering as it is the best option for pvp focussed characters. Offers s lot of option as stun grenades, defensive trinkets like spell reflection, sapper chsrges for aoe dmg and so much more..
---
She is Exalted with Satyrnaar
---
Both Bloodfang and Earthshaker have significantly more Alliance online than Flamelash does at the moment, which really doesn't bode well for Flamelash in the long term.
---
I moved two or three weeks ago to Bloodfang and it was a great decision, the grass is definitely greener here. I'd suggest anyone still on Flamelash moves to one of the new servers as soon as they can - there's only slightly more than 24 hours left!
---
Largely, my take on the whole situation is something like; Vanilla and TBC were great MMOs, after that they all sucked, and the issues right now in classic are faction imbalance and population density. I think in vanilla there was, as all agree, less population, and I believe less server transfers, so imbalance was better. Generally, I disagree with people who think nostalgia is a big factor, and the reality is that vanilla wow was a very great well done game, which is why so many people got so into it. Mostly, I will continue just hoping it doesn't get messed up too badly, and hoping that BGs alleviate most of the current issues. Nochanges is largely an effort to prevent it from getting messed up, So, you might label me as one of these mythologizers, but I will continue thinking that the closer they can get to what it was back then, the better. I think I agree with your main point that the players playing differently is relevant (ie. gank squads,) however, if population density was less and factions were balanced, everything at this point in time would be great wPVP, with lowly lvl 48 questers still skulking to avoid the fray, but it would be doable.  I think it might be possible to improve upon what was done but we aren't really in a position to do so. FWIW I played in vanilla but not on pservers. I think for those who have been following all along, a lot of this was foreseeable, but it shouldn't be expected of everyone, but Blizzard has been fairly famously out of touch, pretty much the entire time.
---
Dwarf priest. Stone form a blind and deny the reset
---
heh he had the same last name of my mother
---
Is bis gear mandatory to do all of the content in this game today or not?
---
I’d argue it’s not and you can clear MC/Ony with all of your raid in whatever gear they found from lvl 60 instances.
---
If I’m right by definition getting bis IS a tryhard thing to do.
---
Hi, /u/wowgall
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e67dbn/engineering_epic_moment/). 
---
Today we (Venture) transferred as well. Best decision ever. Enjoy the dead PvE realm, but hey at least you wont need 5 raid group to contest Azuregos with us.
---
filthy nasty mage
---
Earthshaker, good ratio and population
---
I'd prefer to keep SOME of my life alive outside the game tyvm
---
I've not personally tried it (because I didnt know about it at the time) but I suspect that heroic strike queing could actually make dual wielding while leveling very strong. you can drastically improve the accuracy of your offhand even without hit gear
---
At level 60 you can more or less just run to them by utilizing a couple safespots to reset aggro.
---
Both Celestial and Lost Chapter have moved as well so that another 80 active raiders
---
No because it is sort of the only thing to do. You are not trying hard if you are getting bis. You are just doing the normal thing.
---
When it comes to pugs I expect complete incompetence and a painfully experience that lasts way longer then it should. If I'm wrong I'm pleasantly surprised, if I'm right it's not that bad since I was expecting it all along. Pessimists are rarely disappointed.
---
Someone I barely know and has a tenuous relationship with me in the first place ain’t getting me to help them sit in UBRS forever in a pug when I have a hundred other things I could be doing instead. Expecting more from basically a stranger is exactly what I’d cal entitlement. You don’t really random people in your class to be your best friends, that’s why you make friends.
---
&gt; Any suggestions?
---
Roll on a PvE server?
---
Additionally, if you take a flight path going to a friendly territory, you'll be unflagged when you land. So I set my hearth in Westfall and fly to Stormwind, am immediately unflagged upon landing.
---
It's illegal to complain as Alliance on Heartseeker. The Horde are gravely outnumbered 60:40 on that realm and they won't take suggestions like this lightly. As Heartseeker Alliance we endure no hardships, the boat is never camped and you can waltz right into DM during peak hours any night of the week.
---
I pray you get all the fancy purple loot my friend! :D
---
Blizz did nothing about the servers imbalanced, even more so is how important balance is on the pvp servers.
---
Guilds got bored of being camped and severely outnumbered every flight path and boat.
---
&gt;My only thought is that mining is easier initially as you can smelt all the way to 135 skill
---
You're not wrong, you can basically buy up to like 130~ skill for a few gold on the AH.
---
That being said, if you are 60 and have a mount, all you need to level herbalism is to run through lower level areas for a while. 99% of mobs won't aggro you and if they do, they'll die in a few hits until you get to level 40~ areas where you'll be at about 200 skill. 
---
&gt; I just think the competition for thorium veins is insane and no class can solo DME right?
---
Yeah, I was 60 before I hit 300 mining on my mage, but my druid is already at 300 herbalism at level 49, it's way easier to find yellow/orange herbs than it is to find the one specific node you need.
---
So while getting to 130 mining may be easy, the part after is the real pain. 
---
As for soloing DM:E, I'm not too sure... I've heard anecdotally that some hunters can do it, but I've never seen confirmation.
---
haha oh good one lets compare hobbies of watching a game vs playing it.....I can talk those same peoples ear off about this game and many things that come about from playing it for hours and like I say from many different angles then just "playing a video game" wow is a bit special among video games due to the social aspect and many other games try to do this but Ive played all the well reviewed mmos.The culture that you get from classic wow in the myriad of experiences is something that I feel separates it from just a normal video game. So yes actually I welcome the people who want to talk smack about my hobby because I can defend it with more than " well I am lazy and dont wanna play so I will watch this person who will for whatever reason think that I like (them) lol" nah F all that noise Ussually that defense is finding out what that person does and its normally "watching something" so right there its not a hobby to watch something. your just wasting time.
---
Also as an FYI, if you're not the MT of a currently raiding guild right now, you're not going to get it. So don't worry about it.
---
Still just not even close to true. It's "mostly" all online forums, not even remotely true that it's "mostly" gaming forums.
---
Just a bad choice of words for a bad point made based on, what, like fifteen forums total? Please.
---
Thanks for your comment, yeah I always forgot the cj disease csf protein name, now I will never forget it ^^ 
---
See my edit for clarification and a good laugh!
---
Horde don't know love.
---
Some people just suck. But personally as someone who has a lot of experience I am fine with someone not knowing what to do as along as they are vocal about it. What is really frustrating is someone who doesnt know what they are doing but doesnt make that known or try to take things slow. 
---
Such as the other night when I ran with a Warr who was a lil under-leveled in BRD and proceeded to charge every group to pull rather than shoot mobs  to pull or los pull.
---
It's a capital
---
The guild of Classic moved too, we had 78 online players on earthshaker today during raiding with T1.
---
Charred Vale is a place of toxicity. While leveling my alt I got some really nasty whispers because I was killing the Fire Elementals for the quest. Apparently I was not allowed to because they are farming the Elemental Fire from them.
---
Why is it the only thing to do?  
---
Because everyone does it or because the content requires it?
---
All my friends are on this server not gonna leave
---
Time to re roll 😁
---
Thanks for the advice, I usually wear my plate gear.
---
See my edit above for clarification :)
---
Wait til Dec 10th when BGs are released. wPVP is broken right now and is NOT what’s originally intended.
---
Ignore anyone who says “rErOlL on PVe” or gO baCk to REtaIl!!!” like fucking idiots.
---
Macabre left also it seems
---
Alliance.  Listen to me.  If you’re having a miserable time playing.  BE part of the problem.  I got so much shit for asking and saying I was gonna take one of the free-server transfers to an alliance heavy realm, but it was so worth it.  I can finally play the game again, and on top of that everyone is generally much happier and more pleasant to be around on my new server.
---
I went Warlock for the mount.
---
What's the spawn timing on Whipper Root Tubers in Felwood, and what determines whether they're cleaned or uncleansed?
---
Nope they actually had the edge in equipment
---
Their defeat was entirely due to command, communication and structural failures
---
Find obscure places to grind mobs. Or keep doing anger runs until you get sgc. Make it a game, see if u can win sgc before 60 haha
---
In retail Night Elves can *be* mages.
---
Thanks that is some good advice. The reason was smth different though, check out my edit
---
Well, maybe things will get better when battlegrounds come out.
---
It’s called pvp.
---
Shaman can do the same! :D
---
The servers are all virtual, there is no difference in hardware costs to 1 server layered with 10 1000 person layers and 10 servers with 1k each.
---
Thanks for your help, check out the edit for some laughs
---
nah it is mostly gaming forums that act petty like that
---
but glad to know you have a different opinion bud
---
Literally 1
---
Hey my rogue needs those spell power cloth legs.
---
True
---
Herbing up to 300 is very simple if you're over levelled on a PvE server.
---
It's probably about as difficult if you're in the dominant faction on a ganking server.
---
It'll be easier than questing as minority faction on a ganking server, as you generally wont be in areas where the easy to kill and honour-rich 50s are.
---
Imagine having an anvil and the bank/auction house at the opposite sides of the city.
---
Ok makes sense, hopefully they do a mix, don't really see any reason not too. Thanks for the reply.
---
If you are on Skeram as alliance my apologies, but almost our entire guild transferred to Arcanite Reaper.  Out numbering alliance 10 to 1 wasn't any fun, and the AH Market/resource farming sucked ass as horde there.
---
As a rogue, that was my goal from 53+: HoJ before 60, and I got it at 59.5
---
The gear you need from MC:
---
-Flameguard gauntlets -onslaught girdle -quick strike ring (maybe band of Accuria if you're running the crit shotgun instead of strikers mark) -wristguards of stability
---
I don't think it's most by a long shot. The edges are just much more memorable. Then someone comes to Reddit and starts bitching about elitists, or whatever, and people take offense because they think they're being attacked, when really the guy is talking about an extreme case. 
---
People just need to lighten up and use the ignore button a lot more if they're sensitive.
---
just bring a step ladder with you
---
Wear T2 and spec 1 point in SF.
---
Horde*
---
the question is whether or not someone is able to loot the leaf from domo's chest if they were not even in MC at the time of the fight. (just like DM trib chest). Wondering if anyone has witnessed it
---
Based on my downvotes everyone on reddit thinks cross faction collusion is fine.
---
Maybe in phase 4 we can get blizz to make everyone speak common language
---
I just hit 50 as well. It’s brutal trying to level now that I am worth honor.
---
Bots don't don't back. You can just unload on them whenever.
---
It takes 3-4 days of farming to get BiS.  **g o T o RE T a IL**
---
For the love of god...turn off the Spy sound effects. That shit is like nails on a chalkboard.
---
Shhhh dont spread my secrets.
---
Oh hey look the wowhead survey from before the first wave of transfers...and 2nd wave of transfers. Remember how ally could transfer for 30 min of the 2nd wave of transfers? Good times. 
---
Seriously that survey is from 9/14...
---
What mobs do u refcomend grinding there
---
Blah blah bla.
---
Yeah and I some how some way, keep coming up with a tank like every single day.
---
Raid leaders should never expect that everyone knows wtf is going on. That's a recipe for disaster.
---
Explain fights, it takes 30 seconds and is extremely time-efficient compared to a wipe.
---
Winter spring and farm mobs
---
Gnomemercy from the horde. They kill on sight.
---
Some people would really rather spend weeks wiping in MC than spend a few minutes finding out what gear they should be working towards and how certain boss mechanics work. If they can find 39 other people that also have 6 straight hours to raid every week, more power to them.
---
Just please make your willful lack of knowledge known immediately if I'm in a dungeon with you so I can put you on ignore and find someone who has fun contributing to the group's success instead of being deadweight and crying about being born in the golden age of information.
---
Great name!  The outfit is nice too.  😀
---
Then make it 20% and we're right at the 80:20 rule
---
The second wind of alts is about to start.  Look at primary roles that were lacking in the first rollout of characters, and realize that people will select from that.  On my server, it would be:
---
Warlocks - \*\*\*\*\*
---
Priests - \*\*
---
Rogues - \*\*\*\*\*
---
Hunters - \*\*\*
---
Warriors - \*\*
---
Each asterisk indicates the rarity of grouping with one of these, so the higher the asterisk, the more "rare" the class.  I played a warrior, and there were a LOT of warriors who played in the first part; they just didn't want to tank.  (Seriously, if I started a group and didn't say "tank slot filled" I'd get no responses from warriors.  If I did, I'd have two or three trying to get into the group.)
---
Do you want to solo to 60 without worrying about instancing?  Hunter, Warlock.
---
Do you want to instance to 60?  Warrior or Priest.
---
A Rogue can do either.
---
We need faction queues baad. Ironforge has less people in it every day :( 
---
I love the community I hope BGs helps shit out
---
dunno whether sarcastic or not :D
---
&gt;As a shadow priest I love grinding on rogues  
---
Are you Horde? Because for Alliance it's way harder and not worth the time. 90% of all rogues are Undead ...
---
Try ZF more, he hearth is in Gadget as Horde and it usually takes me about 10 mins to make it to the flightmaster from the inn, so there should be peeps out and about to help.
---
Ahahaha.
---
True, healers can be hard to find sometimes. 
---
Warlocks also bring a lot of utility, though. I've been in a bunch of groups where the "have summons" thing in LFG chat has people wanting to join us over another couple guys LFM for the same dungeon. And then you have the soulstone you can put on the healer, healthstones you can hand out to players, blood pact to help the tank, etc.
---
I tend to go for pet classes, the mount was just a bonus.
---
The usual world zones like Arathi Highlands, Ashenvale, and Hillsbrad will still remain bloodbaths. Players have to travel to these zones to queue for BGs. And they won't sit quietly if they have a 20, 30, 60+ minute queue. They will get in line and then go fight the readily available enemy players who also got in line and are wandering looking for the same.

I would guesstimate that this could mean zones that are further away and inconvenient to get to from the zones with Battleground masters might see fewer roaming gank squads.
---
He means human warrior.
---
For the meme? Or do people actually have some sort of pre concieved notion of what players that roll gnome are like? I see this all the time but I dont get it
---
Yeah there's usually one or two rogues up top where the mage portals let out in Org too.
---
Yeah, you need to complete the quests.
---
&gt; I'd rather play with a lock any day
---
It's usually super easy to get into a group, too. People love the summon.
---
Since  you edited it, i guess i don't need to explain anymore.

Here’s an updated server pop link, check that one out

I rolled paladin so im my own pal.
---
In what way are you contributing to a conversation by telling people that they should Google their question? What about when you say that they should have googled before rolling their character?
---
If you are someone who finds yourself saying things to people, maybe ask yourself three questions:
---
1. Does this need to be said?
---
2. Does this need to be said now?
---
3. Does this need to be said by me?
---
What purpose is served by you telling people to Google? What purpose is served by you telling someone that they should have googled before rolling their character?  It seems to me that these kinds of posts contribute absolutely nothing and are made solely to make yourself feel superior.
---
If someone makes a post and your first response is that you should tell them to Google, maybe just don't respond at all.  If someone complains about their class, and your first impulse is to insult them by asking why they didn't Google before rolling that class, maybe just don't post.
---
So you're not necessarily wrong that people should generally make better use of Google, but so what? It's not your job to tell people that, and when you do, it's insulting. So maybe practice just ignoring these posts if you don't have anything helpful to add.
---
Not just once, but the experience was enough for me to purposefully hold off on wpvp when I already see outnumbered alliance. So congrats to the folks in Feralas for adding one more Horde to the roving packs.
---
Dumb question but when a bot character dies, how does it come back to the body? Does the bot program know to find the corpse or does the controller look through to see who’s dead and manually corpse run?
---
Geeze. I did those runs and got my sgc and saw about 10 hojs.
---
You don't need to de-target.  Just gouge and run away, preferably in the direction behind where the enemy is facing so its a tad harder to get any kind of instant cast off on you before you restealth
---
You can get ele fire there? Why are there always 10 horde camping the spot in Arathi?
---
Team Træls moved to Earthshaker as well.
---
If you can manage it sure but I'll say this from experience, it is tough to learn and exhausting to maintain for several hours
---
Server? The guild I’m with rn is still taking all levels and we’re real friendly!
---
Add paid transfers from PvP to PvE already FFS
---
I dont think the server is dead but the alli side took a serious hit. 
---
High population high horde %
---
I just made an alliance warlock on Noggenfogger. Im here to help!
---
Because that is what the game is.
---
When I log on and decide "hey lets play some wow, lets do some dungeon" instead of randomly fumbling around dungeons not achieving anything I look up what items I need and do those dungeons.
---
What are you even talking about ?
---
Not worth. Get rings with real stats
---
WoW pvp has always been balanced around a team concept
---
so while your lvl 51 and hes 60... the concept is.. if a 60 is trying to kill you
---
Most guilds at this point would in general have a few 60's...
---
I for one always answer the call from a low level guild mate to stop someone from hitting them
---
This is also due to the battleground alterac valley, which is a 40 on 40 person war
---
and the minimal point to enter that battle is 51.... you will be with 60's too, but ... there are OTHER 51's to fight as well... 
---
WSG if your 60, is ... 60 only
---
I see Alliance botters all the time outside of their town in Arathi Highlands, right next to the Horde Mage AOE farm spot. They just kill raptors and spiders endlessly. Got my level 35 Mage to Grunt just from killing bots for free honor! Plus they keep the area clear of the raptors so I have more room to kite the mobs I’m AOE farming.
---
For sure, lets imagine that it took 40h to implement it (hard to guess because we dont know how messed up their db infratructure is). that shouldnt cost more than 1600€ if they did it inhouse. So after 64 transfers it already paid for itself. Even if you double or triple the work, its a joke. Although i dont argue against the pricing, im fine with it.
---
and noone cares if you do 200k or 20k or 2000k. Thats just bragging.
---
My other suggestion, scatter shot. Took me forever to do franklin. Scatter shot and I was done in one try.
---
Do enchant procs (Such as Crusader) count towards your maximum buff limit?
---
It is great. Insanely great. I went from using 1-2 mana pots, mana tide, and a dark rune to parse in the 90th percentile. About 30-40g in consumables a raid. 
---
In 3 raids I’ve now used 6 major mana pots and 4 dark runes. The mana refund is insane. 
---
Healing 5 mans it is even more noticable. Most fights I have 60-70% of my mana left. 
---
Overhealing is an issue in raids but last week parsed 95%+ on ally fights without any world buffs. 
---
All this said I ran the math on optimal gear to keep the 25% armor debuff up on the MT today while minimizing +healing loss. I highly recommend having the following:
---
- Crit neck from DME
---
- Hide of the wild
---
- Mp5 Crit ring from rend
---
- Rosewine ring
---
- 2% crit trinket. 
---
- Briarwood trinket
---
This is between 2-7% (depending on heal size) less effective than only pre-BiS +healing gear but 25% armor will make up for it in overall raid damage taken. 
---
Our fury/prot MT is stoked.
---
Resist and spell miss are calculated separately even though they both show up as "resisted" when you miss the check.
---
I'm gonna get downvoted but here goes 
---
Your idea of staying in dungeons is good.
---
You can reset the instance with people in it. Or do a raid group and reset with an alt. Plenty of ways to not get ganked outside of an instance.
---
I'm on the most heavily outnumbered server. And I'm on the positive side.
---
I get ganked outside of choke points and instances as well. I'm too easy a target in those locations.
---
I dont get corpse camped like the poor alliance do sometimes. As there are plenty of horde for them to chase while I corpse walk.
---
But I leveled from 51-58 almost exclusively in BRD and a bit of BRS.
---
Phase 2 is just tough in general,for most alliance it's far worse but a 5v1 is a 5v1.
---
I play at odd hours so most of the servers pop is down by the time I login. Seems a lot more like 50 50 or maybe 55 45 to me.
---
By the time you're 60 you'll have seen some cool drops from brd. And there are always groups forming for it since warriors need sgc and melee need hoj. Casters need second wind etc.
---
Hi, /u/SteoG96

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e67wil/week_2_of_razergore_eu_alliance_rolling_to_mc/).
---
They should just fix it so you can carry multiple unique items and just keep the restriction to equipping.  It's so fucking stupid
---
It doesn't count as griefing because it isn't griefing. It's just pvp on a pvp server. Griefing would be if you were a hunter trying to complete the Rhok'delar quest and another member of your faction kept hitting and despawning the demons that you had to fight solo. Within the rules of the game there is no recourse. This happened to me back in vanilla, where a druid would sit stealthed and wait for hunters to start the encounter and then hit the demon so it would despawn for five hours. In the end of course, Blizzard did nothing about it so I had to break the rules and convince some horde friends I made on the realm forum to keep him under control while I did the quest. They were even kind enough to MC him so I could kill him myself after I was done.
---
Even one outside of bear form burns through my druid, if they play well. Granted I'm missing a few pieces for full epic PvP gear, but it's still got 4,2k hp.
---
Arcanite Reaper could use some horde...just putting that out there.
---
I thought it was useless
---
Battlegrounds should be sole-realm, so you get to fight against the same people and build rivalries.
---
Server identity should matter in Classic Wow.
---
Arathi has been told to everyone as the "best place" to farm them.  Because they do indeed drop at a higher % per mob.  But with how popular it is you probably get less of them based on how few tags you'll get.
---
No notion of the player I just think the race is annoying looking.
---
Just like all the undead are edgy assholes all the gnomes are annoying little shits IRL.
---
^/s
---
^^^Keep ^^^ganking ^^^them ^^^though
---
Weird how experiences differ hey?
---
45-52 was aids. No dungeons to grind. I love dungeons.
---
52-60?took less time for me than  45-52
---
its called being proven wrong lol
---
It used to be insanely OP, it used to last 10 seconds and have no internal CD and it could proc while you were immune to damage, so you could have the immunity up 24/7 if you had enough mobs on you.
---
wasnt this already confirmed
---
Can someone provide some translations?
---
I saw a Horde player on this subreddit unironically insult Alliance players for sucking at PvE because they picked the side with better PvE racials and Paladins.
---
They're... so close to becoming self-aware, yet still so far.
---
What is item restore?
---
Yeah I actually feel bad for warriors this phase. As a rogue I can just go to MC and get all my gear there, I only had to get enough stuff outside raiding to do decent damage... which as a rogue is pretty damn easy if you have half a brain.
---
Most of our warriors are just pooling DKP to use on weapons, though thankfully we've had 3 Brutality Blades this month so they've been pretty happy.
---
This is on Pagle - NA, and yes, that flags them.
---
Don't correct the man, he's better than us.
---
Do you just wear devilsaur armor. How do bears get hit?
---
as an alliance on heartseeker, i agree with this post
---
yes, bots are capable of pathing to run from the gy to their corpse. 
---
before honorbuddy was discontinued, it could fully quest from 1 to 110 with next to no human interaction the entire way.
---
\*record scratch\* \*freeze frame\*
---
I solo dm:e both as holy and shadow. Warlocks can do it to
---
That’s because there is no such thing as BiS for a tank. Some encounters call for more mitigation, some more threat. Current content is easy so there is little need for mitigation gear if your healers aren’t trash. “BiS” for a tank is as much mitigation as you can get away with while still holding threat off your top dps. As your guild gears up, you’ll have to drop mitigation gear for threat gear.
---
Reeeeee fairbanks reeeeee... i just complain about fairbanks horde to allie ratio. And act like its 90/10 vs its 65/35 or 60/40 it actuly is... reee reee ree... srsly brah... your crying on reddit is second to none.
---
Huh TIL. Last time I tried to find info people said spell hit works for spells which have no partial resists like frostbolt.
---
Ok
---
Yeah just before the cataclysm around the time of the fall of the much king, some of the Shen'dralar, a society of Highborne mages living in Dire Maul, sought an audience with Tyrande. They foresaw great peril in the future (well, that turned out to be Deathwing).
---
A portion of their society was permitted to reside in Darnassus, though were met with great skepticism. With the advent of the Cataclysm, Darnassus permitted the Shen'dralar to train new Night Elf mages, as they were deemed necessary (or desirable) to defend Azeroth from Deathwing.
---
Or something along those lines.
---
99% of botters I've come across have been mages, here's a fun way to mess with them and bug em out
---
When they're done fighting a mob quickly open trade with the bot and they'll try drinking/eating but it will instead put the food and drinks into the trade window and the bot will bug out and just stand there.
---
I believe you can use bartender and save profiles.
---
The [Hearthstone card art for Fireball](https://hearthstone.buffed.de/res/hearthstone/cards/live/enGB/320/315.png) funnily depicts a gnome getting ball'd.
---
I had never played wow before. So I just joined a server that wasn't having a bunch of queues. But then alot of other people filled the server up. If I knew anything about how bad it would have been I woulda started on a PVE. 
---
I rerolled onto PVE and just got my mount on my warrior. So all is good.
---
I think alot of people were new to wow like me and didn't know any better.
---
how unlucky &gt;.&lt;
---
You made a mistake rolling on a ganking server, and then not getting to 60 very fast.
---
I'd suggest rerolling onto a normal server, and checking back occasionally to see if BGs calmed things down.
---
Eh, I buy it.
---
Exactly, that's why I said willing to listen, yet I still get the odd person who won't get on discord.
---
Feels bad when that fucking teal dress is prebis for literally every healer except the actual clothie.
---
Makes sense.. i mean i like the idea from an RP perspective of having a specific race to dislike more than the others.. just wasnt sure if it was one of those "aLL HoRDe ArE GrIeFerS" type things
---
Pretty much the same as it is now but not even close to the same magnitude.
---
There were as far as I can tell, no servers with 15k concurrent online players on a server, like Classic had. Servers are far more populated than they ever were which excacerbates the effects of WPVP. Anyone with half a brain realizes that if you let the server be overpopulated to such a degree without increasing the playable area, the world is going to be absolutely covered in people, and thus PvP. 
---
The common argument whenever anyone whined about being ganked was always "just go somewhere else then". Which was valid in 2005. It's not valid now, since there's nowhere else to go, since EVERYTHING is camped.
---
If they are your friends, then they should run dungeons with you, right ?
---
They wouldn't stop transfers with the current imbalance. They are clearly working on paid transfers. I predict mid January at the latest.
---
Every time someone talks about how much gph they earn, cut it in half, and it will be closer to truth.  Might need to go even further for youtube videos.
---
Breastplate of annihilation is better
---
Because it is ridiculous that something so harmless required something intended for porn and graphic violence. This soyboy safespace shit is out of hand.
---
None from my server Grobbulus because this server is DEAD.
---
If you haven't yet got the hint that people don't want to be in the minority faction on a ganking server, I'm sorry for you.
---
It was bullshit, he deleted the post... ppl tested.. it doesnt work
---
I like hunters more - they are a little more dynamic and have a higher ceiling - but Mages have a lot of world utility that add some great quality of life benefits. Being able to teleport to various capital cities and making your own food and water for mana and health replenishment just makes life easier. Plus they can dish out some crazy DPS but their rotation can be too simple if you enjoy a challenge. Join up and roll on Arcanite Reaper. Smaller server. Good people. Classic feel. Hit up Saga if you end up there! GLHF!
---
When I rolled a PVP server, I expected to get randomly ganked at the most inconvenient of times.  
---
It did not expect to be predictably ganked at all times.
---
That’s what the game is to you.  
---
Lots of people don’t see it that way.
---
To others the game is an online social RPG not a competitive item hunt to build the most optimal character possible to “win” ... nothing I guess ... fake internet points?  Bragging rights?  A sense of accomplishment in a never ending mouse wheel?
---
Play however you want but the issue comes in when you assume others have the same goals and insist on the game being played your way or not at all.  It’s driving quite a few people who loved vanilla away in my anecdotal experience.
---

again 10 seconds
---
That or drank alot. He was a skater and lived with his friend Jason back in the day that definitely smoked.
---
he deleted the OP after people came with proof that it didnt work
---
So many more have transfered since this was posted lol. Momentum transfered to Earthshaker last friday. We're happy to see you all again &lt;3 The grass is greener
---
Honestly, yes it's bad atm and still will for at least one week but hey many overloaded servers offer free transfers to new/less populated ones. You could just go put your char next to your desired instance early in the morning/late night for the instance run the next day if desperate.    
---
You can just die a few times and take an additional 30min to get to your instance, does it suck? yes. But killing off other people's hard earned honor ranking(it's really not fun camping/waiting for runaway strugglers either) by using an unintended, I'd call it exploit can ruin them an entire week or more. The issue is there is no other option atm and falling behind will make it harder in the future (better gear = easier life in BGs/WS-Groups).    
---
Btw, if you really hate getting camped, take a break for another week or smurf below lv48, that's pretty much it.
---
Well guess i was wrong about Venture LUL. Rip server
---
Guys....I rest my case lol
---
That's why you se your hearth somewhere they wont expect and just eat the FP cost to get to IF, I used to say Menathil harbor but that's getting raised so often these days. So go with the town just south of IF and just mount up and ride to IF
---
They quite literally discriminate against the Forsaken.
---
11%?! O_O Nope, it's 9%

That's pretty much how it's always been because the models for gnomes are smaller. I never noticed it until doing the caverns of time with that portal swamp room and all my night elf friends could walk around but I was considerably slower because I swam instead. As for the difference between make and female models, for that I have no idea.
---
I've been grinding Blasted LAnds lately, sending all my Vibrant Plumes and Glowing Scorpid Venoms to my alt in preparation
---
Regarding the Quest NPC dying to Patrol:
---
If he is far enough outside the Gate he can Heal himself and won't die. If he is to close he doesnt have that extra ability and the Patrol Kills him. Did it without doing anything. Thanks for that Information out of age old Comments on that Quest.
---
try the mines in blasted lands
---
To be fair the paladin epic mount sucks to get. I still don't have mine. It ends up costing the same as the normal epic.
---
Sure, if you want do whatever be free to do so. But not in my groups.
---
Thanks for fast response! Maybe I'll just try to farm out two more than so I could do double LS and one crusader
---
Yah a bunch of people ran around testing this right after it was posted... i know the alliance guy on my server and i got together and gave it a go
---
we both have 0 dhks 2 days later now..... 
---
if this was an issue it would of been a rage-inducer the first week of the honor system... not the 3rd
---
11%+5 from the talents is hit cap for white damage
---
Wait, so no more transfers after the 6th? Is that for all servers?
---
I'd pay 100 euros to transfer anywhere
---
Idk what you want me to tell you. I'm talking from my personal experience and what the majority of alliance alliances pop servers are experiencing.  I'm sorry it's happening to you to, your server is the exception not the rule. But it doesnt mean your complaints dont have any merit and I dont recall ever saying they didn't.  Idk what you want me to say. Every servers different. Most of them are like how I describe, yours is like the way yours is. I'm not really sure what your point is or what you want me to say. Theres only 2 solutions to this problem and they'd help both of us. Either make it where horde and alliance have seperate queues on each server(wont happen) or make it where pvp players can transfer to pve realms.
---
I like how you edited your comment after it was removed to try and make it look normal.
---
All my friends play on it
---
I am Alliance and fully support this message.  If you didn't want to PvP you shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server, plain and simple.  Doesn't take 2 seconds of forethought to come to that conclusion.
---
Lmfao
---
When I change between profiles the keybinds stay on the specific bar, so its not doing what i need. Bartender only allows you to change the places of the bars and apply keybings easier. Not have different keybinds on different profiles. Is there something I am missing?
---
Also since you edited.  
---
You don’t need bis items.  Far from it.
---
Big burst of air out my nose thank you sir
---
Yeah, the raw numbers aren't going to be accurate, but the faction ratios and the relative population between servers should be accurate.
---
It's 9%, but you don't really need to hit that.  
---
truestrike, devilsaur, bracer from ubrs, ony head, mask of the unforgiven,
---
They all taking a break till BGs cuz phase 2 is awful, so I wanna hit 60 so I can run BGs with them
---
That's a common meme. When stuff glitches out on Classic people will say things like "Nice scripting" or "Just another crappy private server".
---
If you are looking for gold then mage is your best bet.
---
Oh awesome, what’s ur name in game
---
This! It’s on the bottom left
---
AH alerts is that a real thing? Tell me more.
---
Uhhh pretty high considering all the fancy titles cheap mounts and gear.  Oh and the fact that it’ll be the only new content.
---
So, be raid geared and farm EPL. Got it!
---
No way you coulda known on the PvP server thing, as someone that played during vanilla this has been a completely different animal in terms of the number of people just going around murdering lowbies. I honestly regret going on a PvP server at this point but at level 52 ain’t bout to change now.
---
As a mage I see rogues everywhere
---
Hunters are the best gold farmers in my opinion.
---
The fact that you can get "honor" points for ganking a player that underleveled seems broken.
---
Feels like flamelash. It was a little less than 40/60 and now all alliance raid guilds left. 
---
Horde dancing at IF and everyone is emoting goodbye.
---
Exactly.  Why anyone thought that the other faction would ever play nice is beyond comprehension.
---
Maybe because I knew right away what peeved off the people reporting the thread.
---
What's the alliance guilds name?
---
I don't know, but reading this post it sounds like you could grind it out in a week, or weekend?

---
Saying its a mere 8 AP, but the item only has 20 AP on it. So its like 60% as good as black baron. If all your pieces are second best, these small differences add up to you being 60% as strong as someone with every best piece, perhaps more then that.
---
Put time, server and place a I'll be there with 2 goblin producers, ready to sell their mothers' jewelry to make a book out of that plot

It all depends, our raid got like 8 rogues, sad times.

Lol. Maybe not 100 but I’m def with you dude! PAID TRANSFERS!!!

---
In my experience, dungeon farming is only fast if you're willing to be the group leader to get things started. 
---
I would second what this guy said about searing totem being the only one that's really necessary. I'd drop other totems if I accidentally pulled too much, but when levelling I found that mana efficiency was more important than DPS. Killing things a little slower will be faster than constantly drinking because you spent all your Mana moving camps.
---
On your character screen, bottom left. The “shop” button
---
Clear the instance or just farm? I mean is the thorium available at the end?

Yeah it would be a lot of fun for him for the first few minutes. Then he’s going down.
---
Everybody knows that playing a video game requires you first complete coursework and homework assignments. You can play a video game only after receiving your degree in said game. Do you think games are a fucking game??
---
I don't know why people have the idea that just because X class can wear Y armour then that's suddenly 'for them'. Rogues don't own leather, hunters don't own mail. 
---
You wear whatever has the best stats. If there was dps cloth you better believe rogues would be rolling on it.
---
I don't. They faced the burning legion a second time without resorting to learning magic again which was a bigger threat. Wow hand waves lore for game play a lot which is unfortunate.
---
Over hyped garbage item.
---
If you’re patient hopefully you can snag a deal. There was a glut on my server at one point and they came all the way down to 300 on the AH and I was able to snag off someone for 280. Checking AH daily for prices helped me find when was a good time to pounce. They’re back up to the 500’s on my server now though...
---
Yeah its after you kill last boss, i kill 2-3 bosses depending on specc
---
That’s awesome. It’s things like this that made Vanilla, and it’s nice to see them happening again in Classic.
---
Probably. We don't know the level of effort it took for layering.
---
Mages can't kill Druids.
---
Mage was pretty weak in 2v2 arena in TBC purely because Druids were popular. Rogue/Mage was the only combo that was really relevant at high rankings.

What's your style?
---
If I have a simple question that takes 2 seconds to answer, I'd much rather ask general or my party or my guild than tab out and find it myself. If your response to these simple, easy questions is "Go look it up," yes you are being somewhat rude and a bit of a dick. Do you give them the information they asked for? Do you think you informed them about a revolutionary new underground site that no one has ever heard of? No, you're just being useless and a bit of a dick for literally no reason. Do you respond to "Anyone want to run \[BLANK\]" in general chat with "Not me, thanks for asking," or something? Not everything has to involve you.
---
Brave?  Sounds like a complete waste of time.
---
IMO, I would say that with all classes are like that except druid. Druid requires the highest floor skill to play well.
---
Personally, I like balanced builds, so 5/5.
---

Any tips for 2h fury? I just won a nice 2h sword from ragnaros. Do I still need 9% hit? And what rotation would you reccomend?? Thanks! I'm a fairly badly geared (apart from the sword) tauren warrior.

Mining or herb. And depends on what class. For primary, just depends what you want.
---
It was a joke....

&gt; Is there some legal way to buy gold with cash that I'm not aware of
---
What does legal have to do with it? Oh, your argument doesn't fit otherwise...
---
My point should be changed. Using 2-3 engineering items and potions every fight devalues your skill, which is the only purpose of bothering with 1v1s in the first place. 
---
To each their own, but I'm going to continue to call it nothing special/scummy/lame.
---
Anyone got the most up to date numbers for realm population?
---
Seems like they're about to close the transfers...gatta make that decision fast.

i do play weird hours though 11 pm ST

Don't you mean..."It is all Blizzard's fault I didn't move, not mine!"
---
I mean MC doesn't drop any dps plate gear does it?
---
Are they all going to the same server?
---
The counter argument here is that horde will have insane bg queues. I'm rolling alt alliance because I'd rather be the underdog  with good pvp then what I'm going to deal with come next week for bgs
---
Gotta get stuff that reduces targets resistances specifically, like the tier 1 arcane talent.
---
[All EU servers yes.](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-character-moves-close-at-1-00-a-m-on-6-december/110483) All NA transfers close on the 5th.

Cool story
---
&gt; so you get to fight against the same people
---
been doing this the last 4 weeks thanks i know everyone and i'm tired of it
---
Did you check if a pve option is available. For me (alliance) on a horde dominated east coast pvp server I was only given 3 options. 2 west coast pvp servers and 1 east coast pvp server. No pve options
