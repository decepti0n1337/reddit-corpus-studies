I mean no changes is highly unrealistic, as it would need to replicate every single patch, hot fix, hardware limitation etc. I am very aware of no changes not being even remotely a possibility, but what we want, and should never stop being vocal about is no custom "features" making it into the game. Even when we go into classic I will never stop advocating for no (feature) changes.  
---
  
---
I think just bending over and accepting whatever they throw at us is conceding defeat, and I won't do it.  
---
    
---
It's not a deal breaker, and I still plan on playing, but should an actual deal breaking feature sneak its way in, I absolutely won't play.
---
---
---
&gt; Introduce a system like this that encourages cheating to the point that cheating nearly becomes mandatory
---

---
This is the most egregious exaggeration I have seen about Loot trading so far. And that's really saying something. Im not even a fan of it, but watching people continually find ways to .... expand how terrible it is to the point of full on fabrication has been extremely entertaining.
---
At least in Vanilla, there seemed like there were 3 hunters for every other class but when it came to raiding very few showed up.  Probably had something to do with how poorly the average hunter played their class.  If you know what your doing and can properly use a shot timer/server lag with your rotation then you'll be in the top 10% of hunters and you'll be able to find a raid slot.
---
It was mostly relevant as a healer, but mages should use a few as well such as R1 frost spells for the chill effect.
---
Those types of people do not want to play with those types of people either.
---
I for one can't wait to name my tauren warrior steve
---
honestly the only combat rogue pvp vid I've seen and enjoyed. enemies weren't brainless, tons of bladeflurry 1v2's, pretty awesome. Must be nice to run an insanely gear dependent spec w/ rank 14 gear/weapons, my god
---
Don't use it. The premium option is a straight up scam.
---
People aren't gonna go to youtube videos from trade chat tho. Hell, you need an addon just to be able to copy links.
---
I just hope that people play on and enjoy RolePlay servers.
---
I will be rolling on a RP server in classic if there is one just because I believe it will provide the best experience, and the one closest to what I remember.
---
I would be as well.  I prefer stuff like better UI options and DPS meters be built into the baseline game.  
---
i'm 26 and ganking would still be life for me. 😌
---
Warlock can summon Infernal or Doomguard in low level area like Goldshire and dismiss it. It will become hostile towards everyone and start oneshotting lowbies.  
---
Killing any quest mob with long respawn time that is part of a long quest chain.
---
Came here to say this. Grinded that spot for so long and to finally ding 60 there was so satisfying :)
---
You've put in a ton of hard work and good research into this, glad its finally done! Hopefully this helps show how important progressive itemization is to Blizzard, or atleast how much of an impact it will have on the game.
---
Best strategy is to farm like 10k gold and make known around server that u want to buy the eye for 10k, many guilds will rather sell it and use that gold for progression.
---
Fear as many mobs as you can out of a mage's aoe farm.  
---
The funny thing is that a lot of those vehemently against it will find some way of rationalizing doing it themselves.          
---
I can easily see: "I fucking hated it but everyone else(actually one or two people) were doing it so i figured i might as well."
---
&gt; and they can cast Curse of Recklessness on level 1 mobs in starting areas to wreck new players.
---
Mmmm the resistant to fears portion of that spell is even more fun at higher levels with spriests and locks over pulling.
---
&gt;"I fucking hated it but everyone else(actually one or two people) were doing it so i figured i might as well."
---
Exactly. This is exactly why I'm so against it, though I don't find it funny. 
---
Yeah, but then you'd need to go to Orgrimmar in order to learn the spell. That'd be a tall order for a mage.
---
Yes!!
---
This really sucks. In general, I can understand Leech effects for Death Knights and Demon Hunters but I can't understand why every class and spec should have a self-heal. That's a damn role that's meant to bother with your health bar and that's called a healer?! Hybrid classes had that as an advantage, something cool about play that instead of a Rogue or a Mage. But Rogues and Mages enjoyed different benefits. And that was cool.
---
Thats a pretty stupid reason not to play.
---
"I like this game but because its old I wont play it"
---
Will you do that with everything? The movies and music you enjoy now will you stop watching/listening to them all together when they hit 15 years old? 
---
What about movie remakes? Are you ok with those even though they are rehashed older movies? 
---
What about cover songs?
---
Will you refuse a vehicle that is 15 years old regardless if its in perfect condition but has a tape player instead of cd player? 
---
&gt; Getting pressured to trade loot for X reason. This happens these days where people will even extort you with group or guild removal if you don't trade them the loot.
---
What
---
Just a note... probably every single on-use trinket seems to be on there on account of the 1.10 change to make double trinkets not be a thing. I'm pretty sure the change only prevented direct damage or damage boosting trinkets from being activated simultaneously though. I'm pretty certain you could still do stuff like Cannon Ball Runner + Barov's Peasant Caller at the same time, although they are still listed there as "changed in 1.10" regardless.
---
Nice work anyway. I do hope that Blizzard puts in the effort for progressive itemisation.
---
*slightly on the way to a day long mute or a forced name change, and only if they have roughly 20 other friends report you in a shortish time frame. 
---
Don't get me wrong, its awful, just wish people would stop exaggerating so much
---
No more accidental needs.
---
Now they'll just ninja and hearth because....they don't want you to have the loot!
---
Yep, I've been filtering out things like this but I've missed some of them. My change detection triggers when a spell changes (among other things) and that's what probably happened; the on-use effect's associated spell had its parameters/values changed.
---
It's that there will be plenty of good new things emerging that I will miss out on
---
It depends if some of the old core guidies want to play. I'll follow them if they decide to play, otherwise I'm going alliance for Shadowmeld on Hunter. 
---
Honestly that just makes it more interesting. I would love to pay stormwind a visit. With 100's of the Boys at my back
---
Feign bewilderment if you wish. We both know that humans seek the most profitable thing for themselves. Only rules keep order amongst the masses. 
---
Businesses lock their doors after closing for a reason. 
---
Gas stations require pre-payment for gas for a reason, instead of filling and then coming inside to pay. 
---
Two+ hour bunch ups in a post-concert parking lot when, instead of a chaotic pileup of people trying to squeeze in, we could made a line and been out in 45 minutes.
---
Insider trading laws exist for a reason. 
---
In this context it is a social rule that keeps people from ninjaing loot in the game. That rule is easily enforceable because the crime is always obvious. Thus, if the immediate "I made a mistake" is not believed, the player is unquestionably guilty of the crime in the eyes of four people and word spreads. 
---
Introduce a system that allows for a ton of subjectivity and opportunity to hide the crime and some % of people will take advantage of that without penalty. Once this opportunity for profit without consequence is known, you participate in it or you are penalized by it. I don't want either of those two factors introduced into the game when it does not need it.
---
Good things in retail or games/mmos in general?
---
I dont plan on playing classic forever, especially if they just let it sit after Naxx (hoping for patch progression rather than expansions/tbc).
---
&gt; actions have consequences!
---
As long as it's not my actions!

Battle Royale is a 1999 Japanese novel that actually has a bunch of kids on an island, where they collected weapons, and fought each other to the death. The Gurubashi Arena isn't a battle royale, it's actually more of a king of the hill situation.
---
Not mmorpgs. I realized prstty quick I don't really like any mmorpgs besides WoW. And that is because the world and aesthetics matter the most to me. And I'm very particular.
---
No what I mean is that there will be other video games that are fresh new experiences that I will miss out on by playing WoW. And when all is said and done I'll just be rehashing everything prior to AQ and Naxx.

Idea but not the same design. My wife loves hers but it’s gotten harder to find them.
---
We had an Orc Warrior in our guild who made it absolute priority to do every quest in the game. If you can imagine this took some time, and leveling was a LONG process for him.   
---
He decided to join us one day for a raid on Darnassus as a level 59. We made our way through the city to the Temple, killing everything along the way. When we made it to the 2nd floor through the waves of npcs and alliance and killed Tyrande, he hit level 60.  
---
It was absolutely epic, its sad how insignificant max level feels now compared to that.  
---
and Rustblade, if you're reading this, I hope you are sharpening that axe for this summer!
---
I can’t wait to do this again
---
It was so long ago I honestly don't remember, we started killing Loatheb pretty close to TBC, so likely the pre-patch I guess?
---
Well fair enough then I cant really argue with that. WoW is the only MMO I liked up until Cata and I never got to raid in Vanilla.
---
Pre patches are so weird lol. I went from doing like 13k dps at the end of ICC to doing 25k dps with the cata prepatch in ICC. I also remember doing legit one shots on EVERYONE with ambush on a low level enchanted heirloom rogue.  
---
Yea like.. what? If someone is trying to extort you and you dont have the self respect to tell them to fuck off and realize they arent worth your time, I dont know what to tell you.
---
This is 100% true, but players have their heads so far up their own asses that they couldn't accept any change that would actually make the *subjective experience* of Classic more like Vanilla.
---
For Horde priests, if you take the zeppelin from Orgrimmar to Undercity, watch for someone to jump off towards the city before the zeppelin docks. Normally, they can survive this fall with a very small amount of life left, but if you give them a stamina buff right as they're jumping off, they'll take more fall damage (since it's based off of max health) and probably die.
---
Lol this and portal roulette got me into trouble as well.
---
Right ? Lol this is a video game. If they kick you...you still have the loot...you win.
---
There will always be another group. You can't control the actions of irrational human beings.
---
I think I want a real hardcore spiritual successor to classic. Something that innovates while keeping all the good old stuff as well. Something about just going back to the old way without any new ideas seems like a missed opportunity to me.
---
Having said that I like the idea of both existing. I just think it's a missed opportunity in some ways.
---
really wish we would stop mindlessly hating on eachother
---
I feel like before TBC and the whole "lol" at the end of a name, mostly made popular cuz of Athene, there was a lot more RPG named characters.
---
I bought a Lenovo last year for $600.  I had to lower the settings but it was able to run Legion well without many hiccups.  I use it to occasionally check out private servers and it's a very smooth experience.
---
Look at the minimum requirements for Legion or BFA. Until beta nobody will really know for sure how far you can push, but those would be a good benchmark. If going for the Legion minimums, I would at least go for 4GB RAM.
---

---
ROUGEWWWWSSSWSWASAWSAD
---
I like your post, and am not arguing with anything you said. But l have to ask what raid consumable materials would come from level 1-20 zones (my understanding of the sharding at launch)?
---
World of paladincraft 1, 2 and 3 featuring Grievous
---
On our server our top horde guilds completely gave up, no one killed sapphiron or KT before TBC so I joined a newly formed guild.
---
A pug formed sometime early TBC at 70 and killed both sapphiron and KT with about 20 people finally downing the last two boss our faction had not killed yet.
---
Not only that, but the shorter cast time too.
---
Or they msg you after with "wts[Loot I ninja]100g"
---
The thing keeping me from trying one is their lack of a rez spell, minus the brez. Too much pressure not to let anyone die if there's a long walk involved.
---
Oh so that's why it's the most downvoted comment in this thread eh? :D
---
This post was removed for Rule #7: image posts need to directly be about Classic WoW beyond just the post's title. Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
Now. In fact, Legion add-ons would function better than Vanilla add-ons (if either of them function at all).
---
This is reddit, sport. You always get downvoted for having unpopular opinions.
---
Would suggest playing on an infamous server for you to decide yourself if it's right for you... and 90% more than likely a sub..as to how much? Who knows.
---
Wonder if there are any BloodhoofUS out there...
---
I was in Flame of Anor, Bad Karma, Drawn and Quartered, Monkey Grabs the Peach from Vanilla to WotLK.
---
And from being a backpedaling jackass!
---
Yeah, I was a complete scrublord at WoW in vanilla and eventually learned how to quest easier with some quest tracking add-on at level 30 or so. People knew what add-ons were.
---
I agree with this, but in my limited testing on Classic Demo, I found that Classic seems to run a bit better than BFA, and significantly better than the original Vanilla client. So, if the laptop hits minimum BFA specs, it should be above minimum for Classic, IMO.
---
It's a subscription tied to the BFA (modern WoW) subscription, so, $15/mo.
---
What server do you recommend, I've heard the community isn't super accommodating to new players so I've been putting off getting into the game until something like WoW classic came out. :)
---
Interesting, I presumed it would be its own thing, Thanks! :)
---
I'd give her my money ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Who back pedaled? I’ve been pretty consistent.
---
Not sure what your problem is with people expressing opinions without first announcing you’re about to make one.
---
Do you have to announce you’re about to ask a question beforehand as well?
---
I should probably announce i’m about to agree with someone before I do as well. Don’t wanna freak anyone out.
---
I miss all those spells 
---
In raids that's less of an issue and in most 5 mans the run back isn't too bad. I don't recall having too much of an issue with complaints since classic is slower paced to begin with. 
---
Also consider the positives, you have two forms of cc: root for outdoors and sleep for animals and dragons. If you get in trouble you can bear form and stun, then get some distance, or cat form and sprint. 
---
It sounded like a pretty epic way to hit 60.  I spent my last half level grinding mobs on my warrior, so it was a lot less eventful.
---
Plus, they're probably not the kinds of people you'd want to be with anyway.
---
Looks like I’m hosting my own runs on master looter.
---
Yeah... that’s a BC patch. Those UI changes are post 1.12.1, there was no way to view Crit, hit, SP, etc. outside of adding Pre-TBC.
---
Mage and sell portals
---
In vanilla, you could still be out of combat while the rest of the raid was in combat, so sometimes out of boredom, mages could make a portal during combat and the clickers might click on it. There was also no meeting stones yet, so if the warlocks all clicked on the portal, we all had to sit and wait for them to fly/walk back. TBC and Wrath had the meeting stones, so a couple from the raid could go out and summon everyone back. One of the reasons now, once someone engages combat on a raid boss, the whole group goes into combat immediately, to prevent that, and sitting out of combat whole fights and rezzing people who stood in fire. 
---
Because it caused the raid to have to wait half an hour for everyone to get back. 
---
That would have been way fun. I was in org all the time doing world pvp anyway so I wouldn’t have had an issue learning it. 
---
Main was a warrior, went prot but was never MT gonna go paladin. Always was jealous of the survival Abilities and being able to support others in battle 
---
Mine has to be Baron Geddon. 
---
Because even though its a simple, early fight, people still forget the mechanics and manage to wipe the raid from time to time. This was proven to me when they re-released MC for the 10 year anniversary and it wiped a tonnnn of people. It was absolutely hilarious to watch in 2004, 2014, and will be again come this summer/fall.
---
Magmadar, just cuz if you wiped to him, people would say HOW DID WE WIPE TO MAGMA-FUCKING-DAR
---
Casting levitate on rogues is fun also, or ANY night elf, to prevent them doing their stupid flips. 
---
I mean, my portal macro used to say “Summoning &lt;target&gt;, PLEASE ASSIST!!!!” For about until cataclysm. 
---
Damn I missed this! It looks back to normal now.
---
The best warlock troll, hands down, was BEFORE they added the accept button for summons. So you could get friends and summon people off the cliff in azshara, just out of nowhere, to their doom, or to their long long long swim, depending on how you get. 
---

---
Most of my irl friends who would play want to be alliance. I really don't like the alliance races except maybe nelf, so I'm gonna be horde. Hopefully I can convince my brother to play
---
You'll have a blast for sure. It's pretty easy to be consumed by the game so much that you may need to force yourself to log off.
---
Anyhow,  there will be (assuming) the usual 4 different styles of servers.
---
Regular, PvP, RP, RPPvP
---
I personally enjoy the RP-PvP servers the most due to the violent but forgiving nature of the playerbase.  Usually a bit older and/or mature crowd.
---
Simothy,  The Watchmen for raiding.  Before it was Mystic Circle for a small time then We Might Be Giants.
---
Omg fk you if you did this to me. That was my money maker lol. 
---
Malygos. Nothing cooler than a world boss with multiple raid groups PvPing around him.
---
Kind of why I hope Blizz doesn't add him at launch.
---
Id 100% prefer a RP-PVP one myself if it wasnt for the case that they usually have less skilled PvP players so thus less stimulating for me as a PvPer, for the reasons you said.
---
Truly an underrated aspect of it.
---
We got TWO Atiesh'es right before TBC launched.  The first went to a priest who immediately Ebayed as soon as the Stratholme fight was done.  The other went to a druid who actually stuck around and was nice enough to port people to Karazhan later on.
---
The anxiety I used to get hopping on that boat and there are multiple players of the opposite faction just staring at me the whole ride... most tense moments of my life
---
Main: Blacksmith/mining. I think BS is a really need profession overall and can make one feeling accomplished when they max it out/get some good recipes.
---
Alt: Alch/Herb. It will be great to support the main with transmutes and delicious potions.
---
Hogger
---
Herb/Alch until I've accumulated enough alch recipes to make alch a moneymaker on its own, then drop herb for engi.
---
Back when gm’s would allow you to request a name to be freed up, i got the name Plague for my lock.
---
This more than anything. What I saw most was if a top raid guild had lower content on farm to the point where they didn’t even run it anymore, like MC and BWL about half way thru classic, then some people would either bring alts or form pugs and then just take what they needed for their alt and disregard the rest of the raid. Top raid guild wouldn’t care since they’re not gonna bother with the peons anyway. 
---
You did, you made a statement that you're claiming was opinion. Maybe you meant it as an opinion but you just didn't write it as one which is fine, but you're getting defensive and refusing to ignore your mistake.
---
I always jumped off... never considered this...
---
Regarding Mages
---
End-game PvE: Basically all of us were frost/arcane until the point that AQ40 progression became more important than BWL farming. Few went fire before then.
---
End-game PvP: Frost/arcane was just as fun as fire/arcane--many of us even preferred it. Elemental was fun to play around with but made you a shit raider. Getting PvP gear was way too hard on my server, so I didn't see many do it. I did it a couple times in-between raid days because it was fun to confuse people, but it wasn't much more than that iirc.
---
&gt;I watch content that I don't like and then I reeee about it in unrelated threads instead of expressing coherent opinions that could help making better content and healthier community in general 
---
You know what will be annoying? When you notice only 1 person dpsing the next pull after a boss because the other 2 dps are whispering each other about the loot.
---
dps 1: How dude do u need that?
---
dps 2: Nah man, im gonna use.
---
dps 1: Please I've been after it for a while.
---
dps 1: this is like my 20th run lol.
---
tank: Umm hello?
---
dps 2: I need it sorry.
---
*dps 1 leaves group"
---
Thanks for the info/insight.
---
I’d love the RP/ RPPvP based on how I like to experience games but I don’t have a good enough understanding of the core mechanics, are they hard to learn?
---
It’s not really a mistake when I would do it again exactly the same way and as long as you’re not here no one would say anything.
---
You clearly just have a problem with people expressing opinions without starting the sentence with a warning that this is an opinion.
---
Man there was that orc warlock on my server back then named "Atmosfear", i thought it was so cool !
---
Select a team of four lowbies and try and boost them up so I could have buddies and run a dungeon or two.
---
Well by all means continue stating opinions as facts, more power to you.
---
I will be playing with my partner, we are going mage + druid. I will be playing feral most likely but have opened up to playing resto (since the professions makes more sense). 
---
I would really recommend one of you to go warlock and one of you to go mage, your mobility as a team will really go up with portals and summons, just a thought!
---
Childhood...
---
I’d just like to see content with the same quality as vanilla so I can go back to retail.
---
The game is unplayable
---
Can someone explains how he has "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, -, =" as his keybinds 5 separate times? If he hits the 2 key, it obviously doesn't trigger all the spells right? How is it there 5 times?
---
OP doesn't like healing, so how could anyone??
---
2h Fury. Every suggestion I've heard recommended that as the leveling spec
---
Made a post about my favorite vanilla movies some time ago, i would obviously recomend them:P Here it is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/84s5i7/favorite\_pvp\_movies\_from\_vanilla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/84s5i7/favorite_pvp_movies_from_vanilla/)  linked the whole post because there are more videos suggested in the comments.
---
They recently revamped the reporting system, to make it where the minimum amount of reports is 5, so he is not exaggerating and is 100% correct. 
---
But first, let me tell you why I like Skillshare.
---
Can the wielder be switched between groups to give the buff to more people between everyone's casts??
---
Extremely user friendly game.  Your success in classic has as much to do with your social skills as your gaming skills.
---
Classic was a perfect mix imho.   Each class was easy to learn and level up, while also providing enough combinations to push your gaming skill quite high.   
---
&amp;#x200B;

Whats the most your willing to pay? I got my wife a $900 Acer Predator on amazon that has better specs than my 5 year old $2000 desktop.

---
Good way to shop is go to a walmart/best buy get on the laptop and go to www.canIrunthis.com and it will tell you if you can and how well.
---
I'm not crying, you're crying... ;_;
---
Hold on.. where is the source they are implementing it?
---
reckoning only stacking to 5 was still called a reckoning bomb it was enough to 1 round players with some crits just not 1 shot a raid boss. Private servers at least the ones I played on only had reckoning stacking to 5 as well. The only big bugs the ydidn't fix were front stab and sitting to force crits
---
Aye, I believe it. And Def more enjoyable than arms.

What is so fun about vael as a melee class is you have unlimited rage and energy (warrior / rogue) so you get to spam yellow attacks like no other fight. For casters this fight is actually shit, its constant push back on your spells but once vael selects you, spamming instant shadowbolts is pretty ok.
---
For PvE/Raiding
---
Every single top private server guild to date stack melee dps as much as they can - There is simply no other class that compares to a fury warrior in terms of DPS, so the other classes fall into utility instead. 
---
Rogue, Mage, Hunter, Warlock - all become utility, meaning you don't bring more than you need. Even late raidcontent like AQ40+Naxx when they start to shine a little bit in terms of DPS, Warriors outperform them by quite a lot.
---
For PvP/Levelling though, Hunter, Rogue, Mage are basically the top dogs.
---
Rifluvr motivated me to be a better PvP hunter. In this video he 4v1's 4 rogues in world pvp. He has a bunch of stuff on youtube for vanilla and BC shenanigans. He showed me neat tricks like if you're approaching a rogue head on they will (or at least used to) most of the time gouge, so if you jump and turn your back to them they wont even hit you.

In full on retail you should have a crew by the time youre running things where a ninja would be a big deal anyhow.

How do you make 30g an hour as priest?
---
 Herb+Alch is my favorite for the convenience of making my own pots which can help leveling a lot, and the fun potions like Oil of Immolation (AoE fire effect on yourself), Gift of Arthas (chance on Hit to curse target and make them take slightly more damage), and Elixir of Dream Vision (leave your body and go on a vision quest).
---
That's pretty much what personal loot is if you pretend a GM is handing out the items. 
---
RFK / RFD run is pretty painful. That might be the worst one? Not sure.
---
Check out acer nitro 5 crazy good price/performance.
---
Tauren are amazing tanks for 5 man content for their war stomp. Troll is better for bosses, as they can dish out more damage with berserking, if axes were BiS Orcs would easily be the best. Threat is more important then a bigger health pool 99% of the time.
---
Honestly though, even a gnome tank can kill Kel'thuzad. Play the race you want.
---
Meanwhile, all Europeans were still waiting for the release of WoW.
---
RetroWoW is the most popular. Not sure if the helmet or weapon you will need for feral are on the vendors though.
---
It's a popular recommendation because all the guides are for private servers where you can abuse /sit for 100% uptime Blood Craze and Enrage. In Classic/Vanilla you can't, and arms is probably stronger without that. Mortal Strike is a far stronger skill than bloodthirst and together with sweeping strikes and overpower arms makes a very good case as a levelling spec. The only real problem with arms is weapon spec but with a good plan you can mitigate that.
---
This could be countered by removing pieces of gear ;)
---
Liar.
---
Go skinning while leveling. Vendor the skins for gold. Use extra gold to buy all the ore you need to level engineering while it is still super cheap as everyone is still leveling.
---
Ah thats fine, I’m just interested in testing Rotations and seeing which ones the most fun for me. 
---
I don't really see the argument to implement progressive itemisation. Without the later fixes it just means 75% of lvl 60 gear is straight garbage, and makes it necessary for people to rely on 3rd party websites/addons to work out what/when items turn into later before deciding whether to keep them or not.   
---
It just sounds super complicated and annoying, and what exactly does it add?
---
Sorry to hear about your friend :\
---
In regards to community I totally agree! I didn't play Vanilla (as I stated above) but I still think the community was there in TBC and even WotLK before phasing and sharding and cross server garbage. I have such fond memories of my small close-knit guild back in the day. Plus all of the server celebrities and otherwise unique communities that form on each server.
---
I'm in agreence with you about the community being what really makes the game so amazing!
---
Locks are held back by their tanks. They generate more threat then mages. By aq40/naxx threat becomes less of an issue.
---
Seems pretty easy. Just pick the faction you wanna play more.
---
Awesome! Hopefully they do, and you guys can make some sweet memories 👌
---
It's setup in WoW right now as all instanced dungeons I believe. If its only setup for raids in Classic and you are doing masterloot in raids like you probably should then I'm not sure what the real impact of this system would be. 
---
To abuse the loot trade system you would have to hope your guild master makes a mistake and then burn the bridge with your whole guild. I can definitely see the impact in a dungeon however as you PUG those all the time. I can also see this being an issue wherever you are doing group looting.
---
Not popular, but I miss my Sony flat 17" CRT monitor. Heavy as hell, but it always looked awesome.
---
how fucking stupid is that
---
Depends on if its in dungeons or raids or everywhere. I find the real issue with this is how it interacts with Group loot which makes it easy to abuse. Why not simply turn off loot trading when its group loot and turn on for master loot?
---
Defias Pillager
---
That is eerily similar! We are also all old high school friends (in our mid-20s). Hopefully you're not too dead to still have fun playing. Although I expect the game won't come out until end of the summer in which case you probably wouldn't be working in crazy hot weather at that point?
---
It seems ideal to have a priest healer in any group, but the plus side is either way you get sweet totems to buff the group in every dungeon. But yeah I'm stoked someone else is doing a similar thing to us! Lok tar!
---
You beat me to it.
---
Problem is that we also have a lot of people that steal fuel as a result...... :p
---
Ha! Nope we're all going Horde (although two of them did play Alliance in TBC). That's amazing - You've got half a ZG run between your friends! 😂
---
I suppose the biggest problem is that it will make Moulton core extremely easy, as opposed to just fairly easy for new 60s, and that's another minor issue, it makes tier one for several classes almost totally worthless.
---
Dont worry when youre forced to go resto you'll have plenty of time to see all your gear :^)
---
They probably didn’t even know the bonuses yet. 
---
Dual wield Fury is actually pretty good for leveling, once you have some good one-handed replace your Whirlwind axe, such as a Scarlet Monastery and razorfen downs Quest rewards swords. Sing remember when leveling a melee class such as a warrior or Rogue is that it's probably more efficient to grind on mobs that are below your level so you have an increased chance to hit, rarely if ever miss your special attacks, and take fairly substantially less damage. Yes, you get less XP per mob, but you can kill them much quicker and it much lower risk so your XP per hour is higher when you're grinding on lower level mobs.
---
That shit brings tears to my eyes, even though I never dinged 60 in vanilla :(
---
Malgayness as they call it on Khadgar. 😂 do you remover a guild called &lt;Archaic&gt; from that battle group?
---
Source? I've not heard of this, and haven't had any friend or myself experience such a thing, and I keep up with every daily bit of scraps of news. I couldn't find anything online about changes recently either. An annoyance on my realm finally got a 24 hour mute after days of spamming trade chat about government psychic torture programs or whatever, and I know of at least 9 people that reported him days before anything happened. Also the only reason your account would be automatically SUSPENDED is by owning a Botting program on your computer. Reporting a player does not suspend their account under any circumstance, worst case scenario is being force logged with a name change.
---
That's when you replace your experience bar with whatever faction reputation you are grinding. Maybe Hydraxian Waterlords for aqual Quintessence or ZG for some sweet recipes?
---
Fury is garbage for leveling without pserver bugs with /sit
---
&gt; I only suffer through it because arms bores me.
---
I love arms.  The big numbers and big crits make it all worthwhile.  Well, that and destroying people in PvP while leveling.
---
As a recent grad, if I emailed teaching staff with a sentence like that, I wouldn't even get a reply or i'd be ridiculed for being a simpleton. Cracks me up. When I go on Blizzards recruitment page, everything requires several years experience. So theoretically this person has done professional communication for 3+ years and still churns out comms like this. Like wtf. 
---
&gt; It was because the game enforced such rules of etiquette
---
how?
---
Best feeling ever!!
---
I always kited the dragon packs near the world boss in Ashenvale to Orgrimmar as a hunter. One of them had a huge range AOE root that would kill pretty much anyone not max level and still smack down 60s. Apparently my guild was getting complaints about me and told me I had to stop, so I left and the second best raiding guild picked me up and said I can kite as I please. In BC I turned to kiting the wraith master packs at the dark portal to Shattrah, that was a lot longer distance. In Wrath they said they put Dalaran in the air because of me.
---
Feardotcom for Warlock... I thought it was super cool
---
We want a community with all the negatives and positive. 
---
I want toxicity and niceties!
---
As the opposite faction, I like to interrupt them when they're AoEing.  That's always fun, too!
---
That's brilliant!
---
I don't think that's why they changed that.  I think they did it so people couldn't cheese certain mechanics (i.e. hunters drinking mid-fight).
---
Does "GTFO of fire! You've been standing in it the whole fight!" count as spite? Cos then it should be about half that and half "I have been healing you."
---
Kill the lowbies
---
ohh good idea on the desynching!
---
KT, I’m a huge fan of Warcraft III.
---
yup I think I sent you a message on testing our routes to see who is more faster from 1-10. I like your theory you posted. 
---
what race and class are you going?
---
do you know what you plan to do from 1-10 if there is no sharding/dynamic respawn?
---
I'm your momma, I'm your daddy
---
I'm that brotha in the alley
---
I'm your doctor when in need
---
Want some cloak, have some mead
---
miss...miss...miss...parry...miss
---
The term Battle Royale has been around since at least the 17th century. Sorry. 
---
I would advise against this - because we don't need the pack with us if our objective is to stay ahead of the pack. 
---
duskwood - once you enter from redridge, run to the nearest mob and just die, res at GY, run to deadwind pass, get your FP in Dusk and follow the road north. Once you pass manor, maybe 20 yards, there is a small hill you can climb to your right before you hit the first spider near the road that would kill you. If you found the hill, just stay on it until you hit redridge again and enter back into Elywyn. This section should take you about 10 mins for 2 zones, 4-5 exploration XP and a FP.
---
Oh look! A contrarian!
---
"I'm sorry...and the mage was doing such a fine job tanking, too!"
---
That's a pretty dang ideal group comp! I think a warlock would be ideal for the ports and soulstone. I thought the same thing about hopefully WF helping the tank with threat (plus buff dps of the rogue). I think mage is by far better for our group comp. I just have personally always enjoyed healing. Played a resto shaman in TBC. So I think ideally I would heal at 60. But I may very well still run mage just so our friends group can have the ports, sheep, and food/water. Plus they're pretty good damage from what I see.
---
I do think I am underestimateling how nice portals on command would be post level 30.
---
We haven't done too much planning as far as leveling goes but we are going to have a surprise event for one of the guys whose bachelor party is soon where we do some lower level playing together on a private server which will sort of be that.
---
Glad to hear another 5 man group of friends playing together!! 
---
TLDR; still an upvote
---
Now noticing it's a shorter read. Upvote 
---
OMG mind vision, another reason I have to play priest. Fuck
---
if you stay with the pack, you are stuck with the pack throughout the entire leveling process. Thus those ahead of you, will at times gank you when you entered contested zones. I'd rather be the early lvl 40 player in STV and quest my way through easily without fear of being ganked by a higher level. If at all, I will be the one killing lowbies in STV later on when I am 45 and you just entered STVietnam.
---
that 1 hr timed save early on only continues to grow as you progress ahead of the pack. 
---
I appreciate your refusal to play Alliance. 2 of my friends played alliance back in the day so I'm frankly surprised there wasn't a debate about what faction to play amongst ourselves. My brother never played wow but I hear so many people talk about playing with their siblings. Seems pretty cool! 
---
Yeah I struggle on the mage thing cause I kind of want to heal but I do think portals would be extremely nice. Especially after finishing a dungeon together and needing to sell things/throw greens on the AH.
---
My friend playing a rogue talked about warlock but is pretty set on Rogue. I also think it would be very nice to have a Summon. We will probably regret it the first time 4 of us are at a dungeon and 1 person is still in a city 😅
---
Why not buff all the raids? Players are also much better now, if we want challenging content, this is the way to do it.
---
It adds a sense of progression to your character, so you actually upgrade your gear throughout the game instead of only upgrading 1-2 pieces.
---
Lul Ive never heard that even happened, goes well as an excuse tho
---
Druid is amazing in a ton of different ways but let me tell you, it sucks if you're leveling with someone, there's a lot of shifting in and out of forms to heal and buff and you run oom real fast because of this
---
5 man DPS is awesome but you have no AOE unless you go into bear form and spam swipe and if you're not tanking the tank ain't gonna like that lol
---
did you account, each time they leveled up, their mana and HP pool increases and thus they will be able to manage to squeeze 3-4 kills per minute.
---
group setup - 1 tank, 1 healer, 3 dps. Healer should rarely run out of mana since 2-3 heals will be enough to heal to full. The 5th player should be a range DPS who is doing the pulling / kiting into the group tank, thus saving a lot of potential damage output from the mob. I think it is very feasible for 3 kills per minute minimum and up to 4 kills a minute once they leveled up and are consistent with the pulls.
---
No no alternative timeline so we can retcon freely
---
#totemmulesarentasfun
---
omg I can't wait
---
hehe I'mma be one o'dem rouges for the first time around in classic :) cya there
---
scrolling through comments as i wait on the microwave
---
DME farm.
---
But she's the first boss. Oh wait.  
---
I will be listening to Critical Role - Season 2 on youtube and/or Joe Rogan Podcast, Ben Shapiro Podcast. 
---
I will also be listening to WWE Raw, Smackdown, NXT UK and NXT when it's on. 
---
I will have doordash/UberEats deliver me food when I am Hangry.
---
Especially cool if you had to mind control the portal trainer there in order to learn it.  
---
Good luck up there young man azeroth will miss you 
---
You're a hero.  
---
Especially when you're the only one and you're lower level. I'd immediately go into anger dispel mode and dance with them to hopefully hold them off long enough to make the trip.  
---
Mage about to frost nova to reset the AOE rotation? Hammer of Justice and he's dead with a repair bill.  
---
hey in defense of tank mage, mages in T2 above raid gear can tank sub 50 dungeons ok 
---
Dwarf Paladin! Going to stick to my old guns, and its my favorite combo regardless.
---
If there is no sharding/dynamic respawn? Tricky, but doable. However at 1-10 you don't really have any choice other than starting zones. Thankfully Dun Morogh is FULL of caves chock full of enemies so it won't be too tough finding adequate NPCs to maul for quest completion.
---
Dont be a druid. Shaman is where it's at.
---
A warrior if I recall correctly
---
I'm doing the same thing lol.
---
There was a decent amount of rage from the #1 Horde guild leader (or their MT anyway). Jealousy...
---
We do?
---
Sell my account and start fresh.
---
Yeah, happens more often than you think (not super duper common though), but it doesn’t go through the courts or result in punishment much because they’re usually just asked to pay it back or else.
---
What the fuck. Hahahaha
---
Dunno why you need to get sand in your coochie, was pointing out that a majority of tanks won't try to waste time to farm Ironfoe and even it it happens to drop it would be better off in the hands of a melee dps

I keep seeing people say you cant /sit in vanilla. You could do that in combat to gain crits on yourself it was a well known strat for Reckoning Pallies in PvP. That is also how the pally solod the world boss in that one video; they were sitting a lot while a rogue buddy used a low level dagger to swing at them.
---
Now if Blizzard decides to stop /sit in combat, or stop it from triggering "being crit" talents then fine. But back in the day /sit did work like it does on private servers
---
Druid is the way to go for all the reasons you mention!
---
I highly suspect the Druid population will be higher in Classic than it was in Vanilla
---
Oh hell yeah, changed my whole gameplay experience 
---
General: It's often worthwhile to make a distinction between world PvP and organized PvP; different specs shine in both.
---
Warlock: Not sure when you'd ever run MD/Ruin, if you needed imp out for tank you'd go SM/ruin for grim reach/nightfall/damage rather than the -threat from MD/ruin. Demonology with Soul Link is viable with gear.
---
Priest: No idea how it's worthwhile to farm with deep disc. Also deep disc is great for PvE healing, with the right stat distribution it can be better than deep heal without accounting for PI.
---
Druid: Deep feral goes more into balance than resto during PvE, although it does go into both.
---
Hunter: Deep survival's better for PvE with good gear, marksmanship's where you go with bad gear for PvE, no idea why you put "requires gear" there.
---
We healers bear the heavy weight of educational responsibility.
---
You're not letting the tank build aggro? Not gonna heal you, you need to learn your place. 
---
You're attacking the next mob group despite someone telling you to wait? Sorry, you'll die, try being more considerate of your fellow players. 
---
You're constantly spouting shit and trash talk new players? You naughty, naughty boy, hopefully the ghost screen is a lesson to you. 
---
Not healing people is a difficult job, but someone gotta do it. 
---
So neither the druid or the shaman will heal? 
---
There is so many combinations you can go but since the druid will likely level as feral he is a prominent tank compared to the warrior who will have to tank with arms or fury spec. 
---
&gt;We will probably regret it the first time 4 of us are at a dungeon and 1 person is still in a city 😅
---
No doubt :D
---
Second the mouse. I needed one after my regular mouse broke and thought why not? Not just pvp but makes farming and grinding soooooooo much more enjoyable. I can sip a drink or eat something and just do everything with the mouse. 
---
This is the cheapest way to solve the problem.  
---
Needs +Spite.
---
Like, 50% more Spite.
---
I would wait until specs are released. I’m in the same boat, my comp can’t run BFA above 5-10fps but it runs vanilla on “other servers” at a steady 60fps no problem. Classic will be using the shell of retail though so requirements will probably be close to retail.
---
I’m hoping to spend 800-1000 for a laptop that can run everything mid settings, we’ll see.
---
If you didn't follow the rules you were ostracised from the server and because you were stuck there, you were fucked. 
---
Youd probably die along the way a few times, but you could make it.
---
Sounds like an aesthetic that ignores the real of the problem. You can just imagine another portal in your mind save everyone’s time. 
---
I've played druid since vanilla, and currently play one on pserver with full T3/bis feral. Lemme tell you that you will never have enough bag space as a druid, especially feral because you still need to carry one bag full of consumables, one bag of feral cat, and one bag of healing gear and reagents. Not even counting the NR, FRR gear in your 4th bag. It's a struggle.
---
But yeah druid is Hella fun I highly recommend.
---
What if they miss-loot an item to person and they tell that person to give the item to whoever won the roll/DKP or whatever and he refuses. Would that be called ninjaing? Also, how do you prove that it is? 
---
Yes and there is some dort of shortcut how to get there.
---
Hunter?
---
Right? I bet like every single individual piece of data is completely wrong by like 3000 points and we'll be completely clueless in Classic.  
---
Totally.  
---
ClassicDB says there's this boss called Ragnaros that's made out of fire. Sounds like private server BS.  
---
Server first belonged to the Alliance guild Transcended, though the horde first was not long behind.  
---
Source: Was in Transcended =P
---
So guess you never played vanilla then. Most people wouldn't let you tank or DPS.
---
I have played a priest forever, mostly shadow, since early Wrath but have healed off and on. However, I have had my eye on paladin for a while. I want to do a bit of everything and paladin can do it all outside of raiding, along with a reflect damage based build which sounds really fun to mess around with. 
---
Looking at a high population private server though, paladins are 50% more common than priests (assuming ally/horde have an even split of priests) and from what I have seen there is about an even split of paladin/priest for raids. However, for most raiders, priest dwarves will get priority over humans/nelves and I would much rather play a human than a dwarf but I also heard humans can't ride mechanostriders which might push me to play dwarf more.
---
I know I will enjoy priest for pvp but haven't had much paladin experience.
---
Finally not sure whether to level up one of those two classes first or a farming class first and which farming class to go with between Hunter, Mage, or Warlock. The only two things I am considering whether I would level my main or farming alt, is how available rep gain will be (cloth turn ins?) and what mounts will be attached to the reps at the start (the unarmored mounts?), and whether or not some of the instanced farming areas will be nerfed or even available at the start (dire maul). All of them have their advantages, mage can make extra money on the side with portals and food/water, warlock has a relatively smooth time leveling and can farm Eye of Shadow solo and can solo more things easier than mage, and hunter has their own unique things they can farm and taming unique pets is fun to do on the side.
---
Server wise I can't decide between RP-PVP and PVP.
---
Finally professions. I was leaning heavily towards herbalism, but I think Black Lotus won't be as profitable as on private servers, I think mining will be as profitable but the competition might be higher unless DM is out where you can use herbalism without competition. Skinning is a must on a class where I can solo devilsaurs but not sure if it's worth going out of the way to get early on, not sure how much it slows down leveling for how much gold it brings in just vendoring it during leveling. Alchemy seems extremely useful. Tailoring is a must on the main for the BIS it brings for healing from what I have seen. Leatherworking and blacksmithing seem pretty poor unless I can get some rare patterns. Same with enchanting but I actually like enchanting, might have trouble getting the raid enchants though... Finally engineering seems like a must for a pvp server which is kind of a bummer losing a profession slot like that on any character I feel like playing a lot. Right now I was thinking tailor/engineering on my main choice, and either skinning or herbalism depending on my farming class choice and then tailor or alchemist for the dailies (tailor would help me gear faster then i could sell any after gearing, alchemist would be great long-term) or enchanting (ability to D/E stuff and pretty much all non-raid enchants at least).
---
Sorry for the long rant but just looking for some advice to maybe help clear up some choices for me. Not sure if I am trying to min/max too much and not really sure what I am going for right now... Also not sure what's happening with multiboxing and how that will effect the game.
---
I don't think they will change any items, they've said that the 1.12 data isn't theirs to change. However what I do think they'll do is hold on to the items added 1.10 until the third (naxx) content patch .
---
I had an RFC group wipe four times last fall playing on a pserver.    
---
     
---
four. times.     
---
         
---
The tank and other 2 DPS were chain pulling crap and would not stop for healer mana.   "I'm oom!", "MANA", "this isn't retail, slow down ffs"...    
---
      
---
The healer was great.  We should have been more wipes really, but the dude was on point.   I expect the first few weeks when classic actually launches, after years of heirlooms and DPS chain pulling instances, there will be plenty of frustrated healers.  
---
Sadly, itemization is a very small cause of molten core being easy. 1.12 class design is the biggest culprit and if we for some reason want MC to be hard this is what we should argue against.
---
It's also the least confusing to players. Logging on one day and half your gear has changed isn't very user friendly.
---
I generally never have problems with healers, as I'm competent and knowledgeable having tanked and dps forever. But in my experience, they are often some of the most toxic players I have ever been around, and are extremely quick to throw blame and get angry and complain about others. It's often not even their fault, but 90% of the time it is the healer complaining about bad dps than vice versa (even if the healer is right). Now this is a generalization and I've partied with some super dope healers, and plenty of emotionally stable, normal healers. Just on average, if there is a toxic person in the group, blaming others for misfortune (even if they are right), it tends to be the healer.
---
Druid is actually an excellent class if you don't want to raid.
---
Gratz!
---
After playing hunter in beta I figured I would try a healer next. Rolled a priest at launch and almost deleted him after a couple of Deadmines attempts where my group kept ass pulling non stop and blaming me when they died. Rerolled a warrior and never looked back lol. That priest is still collecting dust at ~lvl 20 on shattered hand to this day, as all my characters since then have been for years now.
---
Yes. You can jump out of the valley of trials and get to ratchet in a min or two. From there it’s just running to Mulgore and grabbing Ratchet/xroads/Camp T flight paths along the way. 
---
Ragnaros "by fire be purged" the Firelord. Most epic pre-encounter text.
---
Majordomo Executus yells: Imprudent whelps! You've rushed headlong to your own deaths! See now, the master stirs!
---
Majordomo Executus yells: Behold Ragnaros - the Firelord! He who was ancient when this world was young! Bow before him, mortals! Bow before your ending! 
---
Ragnaros yells: TOO SOON! YOU HAVE AWAKENED ME TOO SOON, EXECUTUS! WHAT IS THE MEANING  OF THIS INTRUSION? 
---
Majordomo Executus yells: These mortal infidels, my lord! They have invaded your sanctum and seek to steal your secrets!  
---
Ragnaros yells: FOOL! YOU ALLOWED THESE INSECTS TO RUN RAMPANT THROUGH THE HALLOW CORE? AND NOW YOU LEAD THEM TO MY VERY LAIR? YOU HAVE FAILED ME, EXECUTUS! JUSTICE SHALL BE MET, INDEED! 
---
Ragnaros kills Executus. 
---
Ragnaros yells: NOW FOR YOU, INSECTS! BOLDLY, YOU SOUGHT THE POWER OF RAGNAROS. NOW YOU SHALL SEE IT FIRSTHAND! 
---
/sit makes yellow attacks crit you. The pserver bug is that all attacks do, including white.
---
What your raids needs shouldn't really have bearing on who gets Atiesh. Seeing that you can only create it after you have cleared all content (as you need a drop from KT) you shouldn't have any trouble clearing the content without it. Its more of a (guild) status symbol than something you need. 
---
You are the first person who has explained in what way pservers have it wrong.
---
Though I'll be honest I remember even white hits doing it. But I'll yield that I could be wrong in that department. But yellow hits 10000% do crit.
---
Still I recall reckoning pallies using the sit in PvP. I suppose it could have been to gain yellow crits and not white though 
---
Beautiful screenshot. I love this Vanilla stuff :)
---
I'll post mine here too: [https://imgur.com/a/tZX3T](https://imgur.com/a/tZX3T)
---
From a similar thread I started a while back: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4vkcvn/retro\_flashback\_ding\_60\_in\_vanilla/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4vkcvn/retro_flashback_ding_60_in_vanilla/)
---
Yep! Undead Warlock and Swift Timber Wolf! ALL the Runecloth! &lt;3
---
Strange, I've had the opposite experience mostly. Most healers I had were chill people and it was usually the tank complaining if I wasn't the one tanking lol. Sometimes DPS would get upset over trivial stuff and rarely our healer. I raided a lot as a fury warrior and actually liked tanking 5 mans every now and then, I guess most healers have a better attitude when they know they have a good tank. Some tanks acted like you needed to worship the ground they walked on or they would drop group, which was fine by me since I could just put my tank set on or switch to my warrior if I was on an alt lol.
---
Do you get to play feral much or have to heal all the time? :P
---
can confirm the hunter part. at a certain amount of agility the survival spec will outperform marksmanship in pve allthough not by huge amounts.
---
still the optimal lategame pve and pvp spec is 30/21 survival/marksman
---
I tought you joined a AV like AV4 and people could queue for the game you were in?
---
I've devised a system for this bullshit... if some moron keeps pulling threat or being a dick, warn once, and only once. then keep 'em healed up *just enough* that they'll last almost until the end of the fight (when you can easily win with fewer people) before expiring and taking a 10% durability hit.
---
chances are, they won't do it again, but they insist on being fuckwits after getting resurrected, well... I'd say kick them, but I may have caused a few gigantic repair bills, several times.
---
Maybe you were just bad at the game. I'll leave it at that.
---
Its crazy how different the game becomes when you ding 60. Its amazing
---
Progression exists. Otherwise Deadmines gear would be relevant in Molten Core. Expansions exist.
---
care to explain? it's been a long, long time and that particular dickery escapes my mind. (or maybe I wasn't familiar with it to begin with)
---
Angwe.
---
There's a fair few who think this, but it's also because WoW experienced a wicked growth spurt during WoTLK.
---
Personally WoTLK did so much more wrong rather than right, Cataclysm whoever (widely regarded as shit in contrast) tried to backpedal and fix where they went wrong in in WoTLK compared to previous mindset, the millions of new players put a stop to that right quick though.
---
WoTLK was the fall, Cataclysm was the renaissance, The T11 and heroic dungeon nerfs shook it, and dragon soul killed it.
---
While sometimes confusing, having two sidebars of icons somehow makes the RPG feeling a lot more authentic
---
Yeah most healers can’t even imagine something going wrong is their fault.
---
A more correct analysis is that you're riding high from the Wc3 nostalgia and mostly enjoy their throwbacks.
---
I loved Arthas in Wc3 as well mind you and absolutely loathe WoTLK. Way to bring down a favorite character by having him walk like he's shat his pants and he checks in on you 15 times while leveling and then another 5 times on top of that just to see how the wife's doing, way to reduce his presumed threat level to zero.
---
You couldn't steal a piece of gear and get away without members of your party/raid at least knowing about that.
---
With loot trading you can.
---
Some items to look at:
---
Star of Mystaria (Original didn’t have spell hit)
---
All the PvP sets 
---
Don Mauricio’s Band of Domination
---
Don Rodrigo’s Band
---
You could solo dungeons, just check out the hunter vs world youtube series 
---
I would probably spend the first week gathering black lotus before everyone else catches up and i have to battle people for them. 
---
&gt; Gold selling is only truly a horror on private servers.
---
This is crap. Most of the time, gold selling is done first party. The ones maintaining the servers sell the gold. If you think third-party Chinese wage slaves are selling gold on private servers, you're nuts.
---
ICC's atmosphere sucked I think, can we get a side of shaded grey on top of the icy grey please?
---
As for best villain, I find they threw Arthas entirely under the bus with his constant appearances through the leveling process. I looked forward to beating Illidan since setting foot in HFP for the first time, finally seeing him crouching with the Skull was amazing.
---
Arthas? Oh yeah He stopped by non-stop, it got to the point that at the time I was 80 I didn't want that fucker to show up, he wasn't intimidating or threatening, just annoying.
---
oh, and his walk looks like he shat his pants.
---
You will need to return to Mulgore for your pet quest at level 10
---
Deep resto shamans only take 5 talents in the enhancement tree for more mana. I’d say that is the most all in PvE specs.  The spec is one of the worst in PvP.
---
I used to give stacks of mats to this dude in Vancouver Canada, he'd sell them all for gold on the shop and would PayPal me $1000 a month for my work.
---
Herb/skin and ming/skin, change to herb/alch and ming/eng later
---
boxing day?
---
SSD is Key - i'm running 1.12 and 2.4.3 on a 300€ Laptop. Works like a charm. Go with BFA requirements and you  will be fine. 
---
I don't think they will do progressive itemization though I wish that they would. It would bring the game more inline to original wow.
---
Just needs to have auto attack bound on 1 (even as a caster) to round out the experience
---
To this day I still have no idea why I had it bound to 1 for so long. The wand on - or = is on point though.
---
Does it really matter whether its the server admins or Chinese? Point remains that on retail vanilla I got like 1 whisper per 3-4 days at best, if not less. I remember it being super trivial to ignore.
---
priest leveling is also very viable with specing for [something like this](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/priest-talents/?tal=05000000000000023505000202000005002200000000000) until level 44-45, especially if you like healing instances, as it becomes way easier to do.
---
get the usual spirit tap and wand spec first, use holy fire -&gt; SW:P -&gt; (mind blast/smite -&gt;) wand as your rotation.
---
it works since holy fire has a long cast time with high damage, so it's easy to stay outside 5SR and yet let's you kill shit reasonably fast, all the while being a solid healer. after level 44-45, you really should go deep shadow, however, but until then, it's probably the way to go.
---
also, I really dig holy fire's animation, and that's basically the only time it's worth using.
---
Feel free to add anytime
---
I don't. I also have my flair of OCD but when it comes to action bars I have my 1 to 9 the most important skills I need for my rotation.
---
Other bars are filled with like-minded spells, but not necessary per school.
---
I think you're mis-remembering whispers. You couldn't even go into a city because trade chat was FLOODED with gold sellers. Messages would disappear immediately. FF14 had the same problem at first.
---
Few things that I love to cook for gaming sessions,
---
Pulled beef. You can eat that in tortillas, baguettes or mix with sauces on a pan. Really very versatile and tasty meat dish.
---
Cashew butter and jam on a toast. Quick and tasty inbetween flights. More filling and rich in good fats than standard PB.
---
Millet jar with chocolate or/with fruit. Just cook millet and add yoghurt with some mashed mango and chocolate, taste like heaven, however need to cool off in a fridge for a bit. But is a great snack or breakfast.
---
Bruschettes. Easy af, just start oven on 370F, add baguette, canned chopped tomatotes and some mozzarella for 10 min. 
---
So the correct answer is a boomkin
---
I see the point of this, but i also see Blizzard's point in why they will not gate item changes, and that is that people will farm items that will become good later. And that feels pretty stupid.
---
On that note, anyone know when the OH that is BIS until naxx is added? Blue one with hit and crit.
---
Pretty sure early class quests are race locked. That’s why orcs and trolls don’t get double
---
emote macros!!! 
---
It’s been ages since I played a healer in WoW, but I don’t have any memories of being blamed neither in WoW or other MMOs. If anything, being a healer is the comfiest PvE experience for me, it’s usually quite chill and reactive, and getting groups is very easy.
---
You don’t go deep Elemental as a Shaman for PvP, 30/0/21 is the most popular spec.
---
Probably Alzzin the Wildshaper. You have to kick, stance dance into shield + defstance, your healer has to dispel the boss, use AoE to kill the imps. Loot the imps while the boss is wailing on you. 
---
You want to wear Force Reactive Disk against imps, you want disarm immune gloves. 
---
Positioning is crucial so he does not call the flowers close to him. 
---
I swear this boss has so many mechanics built in that its more difficult mechanic wise than 95% of vanilla raid bosses.
---
Yes and since I won't be in a hurry anyway I don't see how that will be a problem (plus there are ore world drops as well fro mobs and chests although they are not very common).
---
White should crit. The pserver bug is that it triggers on crit talents. I think it triggered talents in PvP all the way up to 2.4 or something, but in PvE it definitely didn't in vanilla.
---
Fucking no, you're talking to a 15+ year old game that has its own way of pvp, and you think it could do better? We want it how it was, take your ideas to retail lol
---
Honestly, I do not want loot trading in the game. BUT, having the ability to offer gold for items to people or strait up buy it from someone who wishes to make money is a direct way to obtain loot. If your good on farming gold, might make farming pre bid items easier in some scenarios
---
Im sure you can tank mate... but we are going to need you to heal this one.. ok bud
---
If you’re standing in shit you shouldn’t be you’re not getting healed
---
SSD is a luxury and in no way required
---
If you spend 1000 on a laptop and it doesn’t run classic maxed at 144fps you got scammed 
---
This applies to Overwatch very nicely.
---
Please write "these are my opinions" at the top...
---
OP here. I don't mind the downvoted thread, I obviously have missed the amount of times this question was asked. (reddit search is NOT your friend so forgive me for not being as dilligent as I should have been).  
---
You did nothing wrong imho. My thread wasn't what the community wanted to see,  38% upvote only, 0 points.
---
Yes, with Curse of Exhaustion
---
You had the chance to say "Ragnaros executes Executus" and you blew it!
---
And is it worth the talent points? Becuase i dont see any other defensive method against undeads. Especially ud rogues, warriors that slow would be hella helpful. But thats just guessing i never played wow so i dont know how would it work in the game
---
Oh believe you me it will. I will do nothing but ninja loot when it's sanctioned by the game as being fine. Cloth head my friend wants? Well I can roll need on it and just give it to him  and the game allows it so it's fine then. Rogue swords? Yeah my buddy could do with a couple. 
---
youwutit
---
After you set up a group taking you maybe an hour you run to the dungeon and summon you won't want to be removed from a group after the first boss. 
---
Completely agreed. While a few pieces got insanely powerful with the updated gear i really don't think making it so that doing anything in BRD besides emperor is a complete waste of time rewarded with some green garbage or having it so there is only three reasons to ever do strat live is much better.
---
The gear was updated for a reason, it's incredibly unrewarding to do anything besides the new(old) unchallanged bis list since you won't come across any potential sidegrades or minor upgrades along the way. MC is already a cakewalk and more so due to talents, class buffs and world buffs than items.
---
u got fear, desth coil, succubus, and the slow. yes, its hard againdt undeads but you got something to work with.
---
i went SM/Ruin and soent a few points in improved curse of exhaustion, i went to about 15% i guess
---
If it's game sanctioned though then that turns them from trash people stealing items for vendor gold to a normal person getting loot for their friend. 
---
Death Coil isn't broken by WotF.
---
\*Curse of Exhaustion : Reduce speed of target by 10% (1 talent point)
---
Improved curse of Exhaustion : Increase the speed reduction by 20% (30% total) (4 talent points)
---
Amplify Curse : Increase your next Curse of Exhaustion by 20% (50% total) (1 talent point)
---
Those are from Affliction talent tree.
---
\*You also have Aftermath in destruction tree that give you 10% to daze the target of your destruction spell (5 talent points required)
---
\*[https://classicdb.ch/?item=10720](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10720)
---
\*There is a gnomish gadget I don't remember the name that reduce target's ap and reduce speed by 20%, really useful.
---
You might want to also look for the item that increase your speed
---
Still seems apt. Just like with vaccines we tried things and now know they work. We tried loot trading and it just resulted in terrible but unpunishable behaviour (why else do we have personal loot as the only way of looting now) so we know it doesn't work. 
---
You can't get both Curse of Exhaustion and Soul Link, with Soul Link being way way more impactful vs rogues and warriors.
---
Biggest problem with this immature sh*t community is that they can't reasonably give constructive feedback but rather choose to turn to rage and outcry every single frikkin' time.
---
People should just chill and relax and see how it turns out. The feedback has been given. Nothing more to do. Soon we'll be able to see the results and then we'll see if it's going to be "See, Blizzard, told you so" or rather "Well, this ain't that bad after all"
---
I don't think you have much of a chance against UD rogues. They have MN and Slowing Poison.
---
Also this sub:
---
I'm going to solo grind powerlevel to 60 for maximum xp per hour, doing zero instances and vendoring all my loot and buying nothing from the AH.
---
Then I'm going to solo grind instances and vendor all the loot for maximum gold per hour.
---
Because *community.*
---
Run people in dungeons for free/counter-gank. I’m a total troll when I have nothing, but Mr. Nice guy when I have it all.
---
During my junior and high school my whole little city was playing wow, like 20 of us. I moved from there but I'm certain at least 5-10 of them will play, as they played a year ago TBC on some pservers. Anyway regardless of fact I'll be joining classic with my wife this time :D! She never played wow but is totally down for trying and I think we will have loads of fun. 
---
We will probably go Priest and Warlock as that is really strong utility dps combo. Id go for Mage instead of Priest but I just like healing (like you do apparently), also being shadow will provide so much buffs to her, and she can also buff my shadow dmg. Overall coolest combo imo.
---
Now regarding friends I've been recently trying to contact them, I think 2-3 of them might join us as warrior or rogue. We'll see!  
---
Facts don't care about feelings. 
---
Ok so just say "no we will not trade loot between players for any reason. Don't fuck up and miss distribute loot or live with having done it." Every party is happy no? Save GM time, save the loot system of the game from being massively abused, save the game. 
---
Dunno why fury gets such a bad rep... I remember getting a warrior to 51 or 52 with fury in under 5 days played time, with some dungeoning and PvP
---
Not saying it's better, but it can't be that much worse right?
---
Except for when I roll need as a tank warrior on the rogue swords to give to my rogue friend in a dungeon. 
---
I never saw them say that. 
---
Assuming the worst as always 
---
All that crying in trade achieves is you looking like a butthurt sperg.
---
Yeah 1 in 100 runs this might happen to you but oh well shit happens.
---
They give me money!
---
Start my alt
---
I've got the patereon set up now time to start working on the video. 
---
Cool stuff! &gt;Thats exactly what Im trying to experience too!  
---
I think warlock and spriest could do more dmg than mage as of mutual shadow damage buffs, and mage is not as good without multiple buffs and bis gear pre 60 imo. Priest can ress even after wipe with soulstone, can heal and have insane dmg before running out of mana. I think that is biggest reason why people say mage&gt;spriest in terms of dmg. Its cause in long boss fights priest ooms.  
---
Aside that cool story, happy you cleared the dungeon before them:D! Do you remember being as same lvl as mobs or significantly higher?
---
True. I might have to join a group or wait for my time to tag mobs. 
---
The... Horror...
---
I ran xp+rep bar for so long! Decided to gring some Syndicate rep at lvl 42 or something and just never removed it. 
---
&gt;The ability to funnel loot, allowing people to stack rolls and trading around the loot each person wants.
---
Getting pressured to trade loot for X reason. This happens these days where people will even extort you with group or guild removal if you don't trade them the loot.
---
You are aware that you do not need loot trading to do this right? Use Master looter and you can do the exakt same thing, be it a bit less convinient. ESPECIALLY on the guild side. You honestly think ANY guild will run need/greed in raids just so people have to trade gear because being "extorted" is so much more convenient?
---
This meme has gone to so such retarded lengths that I'm starting to wonder if you guys even played it at all. Do you honestly think the "extortion" part did not exist in vanilla when epic quality items dropping of trash mobs in raids and thus did not appear on the master looter table? 
---
Tanks wanting to spend time farming it or not have no relevance to whether or not it's a good tank weapon. Which it very much is. The proc is consistent enough that it provides you with solid threat.
---
Exactly. It may be more complicated than just add x% to life totals &amp; dps of raid mobs, but that's where playtesting comes into account. At the end, it seems the easiest solution. 
---
warlocks generally want to wear their spellstone in pvp, so they could not wield atiesh there.
---
 As for pve... dmg wise I would still give it to mages. Mages for whatever reason have better stats on the staff and the 2% crit despite being a considerable dmg boost by itself also synergizes with a lot of talents (imp shadow bolt, fire mage crit talent, armor buff after crit heal, faster casts for hybrid druids...)
---
By the time you can get an atiesh you have cleared all content anyway and these crit effects are more fun than a some spellpower, imo.
---
For me it's more related to TBC than vanilla, filling up debuffs to protect the sheep/nova and stuff
---
You have a massive health pool. Death coil can't be broke with WOTF and you could choose to spec curse of exhaustion but a rogue will just sprint that out. If you get jumped force them to break succubus charm with will then death coil and start spamming fear. Or get engineering and use the gadgets and gizmos to help you out. 
---
I am going to play either a healing hybrid class or a warrior. Ideally my class would be a tank/healer but it's not really feasible in vanilla so I'll have to pick one or the other. Never really enjoyed dpsing
---
And then you have blacklisted two retards that you would end up blacklisting anyways because they are immature little shits. They just did you a favor and showed who they really are instead of at top level.
---
And I as always find it so wierd that people NEVER seam to see the community aspect in this. You fuck around like this and you get blacklisted by enough people then gg, no groups or guilds will have you, might aswell delete that character and start over.
---
Not sure what the pserver community tells people, but when 90% don't go for hot garb like "omgz FrEaSh ReAlM" and ditches the server to re level, reputation matter. And on realms that are not unreasonabley big (10k is fucking retarded) you will struggle.
---
So what about people stop making up farfetched believes and actually come up with realistic and well though out reasons WHY they don't want something over this ridiculous shit? There are good reasons for not wanting loot trading, I'm sure of it, this ain't one though 
---
When it's the norm and sanctioned by the game people will just laugh at the solo player and tell them to get friends. 
---
Solo player: pickachu face.
---
One could wish, the "no changes" meme has gotten so ingrained its damaged itself to a ridiculous extent.
---
"NO CHANGES!!! but we are OK with this minor change" 100% of that goddamn crowd 
---
Well that’s a minute of my life I’m not getting back
---
People are clearing mc in green, it wont change that much.
---
Actually, it might even be sligthly more difficult for casual guilds for which the main difficulty seem to be tank survivability because of the defense nerf.
---
Have people in this thread been away from the internet as long as vanilla has?
---
Stop taking such obvious bait.
---
Look a private servers as an example. You start calling out a ninja and you get told to shut up take the drama elsewhere etc. It's just how it's moved on. I wouldn't ever consider ninja looting in the old system because the item is worth 70 silver -1g but these days yes km going to roll need on an item my friend wants and trade it to him. 
---
There are clips of RBG teams spam reporting enemy players to get them kicked out of the game.
---
&gt;Yeah most healers can’t even imagine something going wrong is their fault.
---
Because it rarely is a healers fault! Unless they are doing something that is not healing, there is not many things a healer can do 'wrong' if they are using their healing spells to heal.
---
Not all classes have a self-heal.
---
And be banned from the forms where you post that video due to anti witch hunting / anti drama rules.
---
And then the entiere guild will say on world chat that you are a ninja (so 40+ people) and you might end up blacklisted by everyone in the server.
---
You probably mean getting a bit less destroyed in pvp. I love arms and warrior in general, but there isn't a single class were supposed to win against leveling in wpvp. 
---
I can't use shadowplay because I don't want Nvidia to sell my details. Why do they need me to have an account to use the stuff that was advertised and usable without an account before hand? 
---
Oh man you're so lucky, I wish I could be starting wow again from the start without any knowledge of how fucking awesome the game is, the awe and wonderment I had the first time I entered Elwynn Forest and every subsequent zone after that, damn what I'd give for that again. You should definitely try it out.
---
This is interesting to hear - I've almost always played healer, so logically I haven't played with a lot of other healers.   
---
My only possible explanation for this trend (if it is in fact true) would be that many healers have been blamed so much for wipes that weren't their fault that they start doing the same to others... not exactly cool behaviour, but I will admit to have been in situations where I was so sick of DPS not going for the right targets, blaming the healer, tanks not knowing how to tank, etc, that I have rage quit'ed, or told people to get their shit together. I do try, however, not to be toxic, as it rarely fixes anything. 
---
Odd comment... I posted a situation that is a thing on private servers that could potentially have an effect on Classic.  People discussed it and several came with good feedback.
---
Dont be so negative...
---
Got to start on that scarab lord title right away. It's such a long journey that if you fall behind you screwed. 
---
Have you practiced your leveling route even in mass numbers? 2 weeks probably won't happen unless you are those 5 or so warlocks / hunters that get out of the starting zone swift.
---
I've got a dk called Plagubearer on retail; I'm pretty pleased with that name.
---
I've also got the name Dyslexia on that server and I'm not sure which one I'm most happy with.
---
Feral druid is viable for DPS with tricks like powershifting and a few key items / consumables. It's amazing what some people have been able to figure out over the years to make druids viable in a variety of roles. 
---
That's awesome! Trying out different names that "should" be taken sometimes gives results. Got a character named "Confused" during BFA because of that.
---
By all means, dickhead still rings true for those fighting way below their weight class.
---
Ganking lowbies is about as fulfilling as completing a game with god mode activated.
---
I always wanted monk to be a thing in old wow. 3 specs mellee dps based on nature and lighting ranged DPS based on fire (lol) and healing based on nature swap between the 3 similar to warrior stance or druid forms make int leather usable by more than just druids. 
---
Shhh don't tell people - it's easier to find a guild / premade / be a special snowflake if there are almost no druids
---
No, it means people have to check an external website to see if an item ever gets good then hold onto that dogshit trinket because it will be buffed to bis in 3 months time.
---
That kind of hearing makes no sense, people will just prefarm the best gear and have it instantly the second the patch goes live.
---
Kael'Thas if you include TBC but considering everyone else is posting vanilla only then ... probably C'Thun.  Never did KT, nef was annoying, onyxia was easy, and ragnaros was  the runner-up due to nostalgia for that first full MC clear and he has a pretty good dialogue/animation.
---
Am I wrong or will classic on classic settings (what we saw in the demo: original graphics) just run on any modern laptop? With an integrated gpu and 4 GB  of RAM (which is the minimum in anything you buy, anyway) I think you should be fine!
---
Grats
---
Do you know if a plate wearer can roll need on cloth for example?
---
Feral is a strong DPS spec if played correctly with crowd pummelers and the head piece that grants energy on shifting into form.
---
He's not an "end" boss but Azuregos. He's basically this neutral entity trying to locate and preserve magic that could totally devastate mortals so we all don't kill ourselves and when mortals find him, they make a desperate attempt to kill him and steal these dangerous artifacts, sometimes killing whole armies of their fellow mortals in order to doom themselves it seems. It's really just hilarious.
---
Me and my bros ninjad a few mounts in Wotlk, from our understanding back then as long as we never specified anything other than the group was ‘master looter’ we weren’t ever going to get banned, and we never did.
---
To piss people off.
---
Oh yes. When wow trancended from ”just a game” to being a actual issue of ethics and moral for me. That end line... 
---
Pretty sure most people here have several of these in theirs, or their parents, closets.
---
So all in all they will need on an item that they wont use EVEN if its an upgrade and then sell it? Thats still extremly scummy lol
---
No doubt feral can pump numbers but the time commitment necessary for it to perform on a similar level to a rogue or warrior is extreme. If someone wants to try that then they are free to but player stigma is going to impede them every step of the way.
---
You cant do the totem and well cleansing quests as non tauren, these are reserved for tauren specifically.
---
I would love to play a class that I can solo stuff with and can level in a good pace. And I think hunters fit that bill.
---
But do they get too boring at end-game? Do they get invites for groups?
---
How do hunters farm gold?
---
There are some great hand/arm exercises on YouTube, I learned about them originally through playing counter strike but it applies to anyone using keyboard/mouse a lot, I used to get aches in my arms/fingers but after doing them for a decent amount of time now I do t have the same problems.
---
https://youtu.be/wYGfDCGrJ4A
---
And with or without progressive itemization, most bosses will go down way too fast. I know, I know, private servers are not vanilla, but look at them: AQ was opened on one last week, Cthun was already killed by 10-20 guilds since then, basically in the first lockout. It is really easy to find a handful of guys for a raid who've already done the same boss countless times and that is a big bonus.
---
Back at vanilla players were just worst than they are now. No world-buffs, minimal consumables, no proper itemization and builds, etc. They all add up.
---
That's not the quest log. It's an addon to change buffs.
---
"I need Healing!" -- D. Va going in solo against the whole enemy team
---
Portals are soooo good ESPECIALLY playing in a group... You will feel like a dick up until 40 since only then you learn the actual portal spell that's usable by your mates but isn't the halfway point at 45 anyway? So no biggie there your mates will be so glad once you get it. 
---
The QoL of mage is just so huge just considering all the CC it they bring to the table and on top you get free food/water and portals I mean come on. Also you already have shaman and druid so you got healz for days
---
Say and believe what you want, but that made funeral hell of a rembered one.
---
delet this
---
They have been the #1 guild For a while now
---
A healer talking about DPS? I never knew there are people like that. I'm not even looking at the boss's health bar, I'm not there for the enemies, I'm there to keep my team alive. If anything, I'll happily take the blame for other's mistakes as well, as long as that stops toxicity and arguing among the players. :/
---
d a r k m i n e s the capitol of the Delfas Brotherhood.
---
Lol
---
Stone me, but I really loved the Kor'Krin Dark Shamans and Siegecrafter Blackfuse in the Siege of Orgrimmar. I run the raid countless times while in university (god when I still had ample time to play!) and I found these two challenging just to the right level, with exciting mechanisms.
---
I plan on doing something similar. Mostly I plan to try and to every quest before it goes grey, which will mean a LOT of travelling to prioritise the quests that are about to stop being green.
---
Could have been playing on a laptop. I know i played Vanilla I used a shitty Toshiba laptop I had for school, and I could reach all the way to backspace, keyboard turning and tab targeting like a real pro
---
Hell I even had backspace bound to ice block
---
I don't think the old UI showed Shift, Alt or Ctrl modifiers.
---
Idd but if you look at the top dmg dealers for druids on private servers there are very few druids who are good enough on druid to deal insane damage and top meters. Most are just middle of the pack/viable dps 
---
Don't forget a healer to resurrect people when they're learning bosses
---
The "cant heal through walls" should be so much bigger... :S
---
you might want to add:
---
Shaman: hybrid restoration and enhancement (basically a healer that gets improved totems to boost melees even more but no mana tide)
---
Priest: hybrid Disc and Holy when your gear is bad like whn you just dinged 60 and switch to heal  (you get the +10% mana talent, rest in holy)
---
Balance: Please dont recommend Balance for leveling to anyone, feral is a T1 leveling spec, boomkin is somewhere en par with holy paladin...
---
Warlock: You listed the missing stuff in the url at least, but might want to add them to your list (SM Ruin for raids and jack of all trades, DS Ruin for raids, SL for PvP)
---
well lets see what happens, but my plans are: mining/skinning for leveling - selling the leather for some extra money and keeping all mining stuff for later (sending it to bank alt). 
---
when i hit 60 i will farm up some more mining mats i will later need for eng, then drop both profs, level up herb (will be my permanent source of income) and depending on what class i will finally end up on - tailoring (if i go priest) or straight into eng (shaman). if priest i will drop tailoring as soon as i hit truefaith vest and go eng.
---
I'm a no changed guy so no changes. But Dwarves certainly deserved mace spec. They are a race of stonecrafters and blacksmiths: their lives are supported by hammers. The most prominent civil war in dwarf history was called the "War of the Three Hammars". You go to Ironforge to learn how to use Hammers. The only Dwarf final boss in the game drops an Epic hammer. This hammer, Ironfoe, is one of the best one handers you can get before raids. Ever since Warcraft 2 the WildHAMMER Dwarves' signature weapon was the Storm Hammer. Dwarves and hammers belong together.
---
I really wish Shaman's were able to seriously tank.  The old talents really looked like they were aimed at tanking for the most part.
---
Loot trading is not being implemented to "stop" ninja looting its to make sure no player will have to use GMs to correct loot errors. They dont want to have a lot of support staff since they have said they do not wish to run 2 MMOs and that means classic wow will be maintained by a minimum crew.
---
RIP.
---
Missed off "Rogues aren't supposed to be tanking".
---
Scourge invasion was just a few weeks before Naxx, not in 1.1.1 or any other early patch. 
---
When you're 60. And you get a new pet - say it's level 20 when you tame it / fight it. What happens next. You have to spend significant time leveling it to 60?
---
I had a couple friends on Horde that I had met from doing 29 BGs on Alliance, I eventually made a Horde alt and joined their guild. I think We Might Be Giants may have been that guild. Do the names Noel (Undead Mage) or Marisola (Undead Priest) ring any bells? There was also a Tauren Warrior I can't remember the name of. Mari also had a Tauren Druid she raided with. 
---
No shear in Classic, only Earth Shock!
---
If I do roll a Mage as I intend to, then I think I will go tailoring and enchanting until lvl5 or lvl6 ish, once I have the lesser magic wand. Then I'll drop enchanting and grab skinning and go tailoring and skinning to 60. That's the plan! Get that wand to make lvl5-10 a little easier, then skinning for extra gold from mobs and tailoring for the obvious benefits to cloth wearers :)
---
You can stop guilds steamrolling new raids by disallowing all non-player buffs. No Dragonslayer, DMT, ZG, Songflower, etc.
---
Personally, no beta (or at least beta release date) by the end of April is panic mode
---
Or maybe just want MC to be buffed so it's not completely trivial?
---
Personally I'd love it if Blizzard banned any and all Addons from being used in Classic WoW, but I know how unpopular that is with all the tryhards who needs their 100 addons that give them info they were never supposed to have in vanilla.
---
Gold farming is quite straight forward and fun for hunters. You can solo a few instances including Dire Maul - which other classes cannot do. There are YouTube guides. 
---
May struggle for some raiding and group invites but just be polite and kind to people and I'm sure you'll be okay. Obviously tanks and healers do better than dps for finding groups.
---
Hi, /u/SquilliePlays
---
can you give an example of a single item like this?
---
He must have some big hands. Actually, I didn't have any keybinds on my hunter until someone said just that to me. 
---
Yup, you have to grind it out quite a bit when you tame a low level pet. They get some dungeon experience thankfully and will level up fairly quickly. Just keep it on passive behind a wall that nothing will patrol into; the low levels aggro very easily!
---
Ok thanks. Does the pet level at the same speed as a character?
---
Yeah, but it's really not that easy to do.
---
I could not reliable do it, in all honesty. 
---
1. Yes definitely playing on launch day! I am planning to take a full 5 days off work, plus the 2 weekends either side. As long as my girlfriend permits it, I hope to be on a good few hours each day!
---
2. Speed run, no. I'm going to take my time, but like most people here I know the zones very well - particularly the 1-30 zones. I'll be on auto pilot a little, but I'll be levelling professions, making friends, visiting the rare vendors and grabbing the limited items from them, doing dungeons, etc. 
---
3. Quest route, I do indeed! I'm going to be following the route I took all those years ago for nostalgia reasons, its probably not the most optimised though 1-60.
---
4. Don't really care! I'm hoping sharding is in for the 1-10 zones, after that I'm looking forward to the free-for-all. 
---
5. I have tested my route 1-20 on a private server using a class that I definitely won't be playing in Classic so as not to spoil too much. I couldn't resist playing a private server because I'm chomping at the bit frankly, like most of us... 
---
can you give a single example of an item that ppl will farm and keep it till 1.10? all the raid gear is better at that point in time. the dungeon gear was changed because the raid gear at the time overpowered it so much...
---
the reality is nobody will farm gear that gets changed later.
---
They were within their moral and ethical right to do it.
---
There's an interesting finesse to weaving autoshots between Multishots and Aimed Shots in endgame content, then you'll want to be ready to Tranquilizing Shot of course which takes a good amount of attention to keep your tank from being diced up. A good Hunter was always welcome in most Upper Blackrock Spire groups for an easy kiting strategy for the final boss.
---
Farming gold by grinding enemies is incredibly efficient since your pet tanks and can be healed with Mend Pet then you're also good at kiting enemies or Feign Death'ing when things go wrong. Speaking of Feign Death, in raiding/dungeon situations where you may be wiping often you can go out of combat with it and even strip armor/weapons off if you think the boss is going to come hit you with an area attack. My Hunter may have spent some extra silver on ammo but not many repair bills. A copper saved is a copper earned!
---
One of those things that were figured out is that the best weapon in the entire vanilla for feral druids is the Manual Crowd Pummeler, which drops in gnomeregan.  
---
It has an on-use effect that increases your attack speed by 50% for 30 seconds, but it's only usable 3 times. So for every active 6 minutes of damage dealing, you need 4 of those hammers.  
---
And even with all of that, you are around hunter levels of dps, which is okay-ish. But for the time and sanity investment required? No way.
---
The Light does not abandon its champions.
---
It would level fairly quickly early on so I think it received about the same XP as you would have if you were a low level and killed a level ?? somehow. They level quicker than your character in an XP-per-level sense.
---
That's what they did in that private server, wasn't enough. Boss is also overbuffed compared to vanilla to my knowledge.
---
"not purely classic" more like "not classic at all" :D 
---
If I was levelling a Warrior, I'd want to go DW even if it was a slightly worse spec. Attacking once every 3.6 seconds is so bleh.
---
&gt;Every party is happy no?  
---
No, players won't be happy. They will still keep flooding GMs with tickets.  
---
Yes i remember this :D 
---
blizzcon panel  
---
Thankfully there are plenty of options to record
---
Was going to say my spite would have been much higher lol. Are we just petty healers?
---
As a druid player i hated the kodo :D 
---
I came to that conclussion aswell but my initial response was ”OOOOoohhhh!? Noooo you can’t do that!!”
---
&gt;cast Curse of Recklessness on level 1 mobs in starting areas to wreck new players.
---
Holy fuck, that is straight evil. Giving a lvl 1-5 mob an extra 90 AP, lmao!
---
You can't jump while levitating, iirc.
---
Sure, that will happen all the time. Literally unplayable. 
---
You take screenshots and present them in the server forum and prove them wrong. Easy. 
---
Basically there aren’t enough quests and you end up grinding anyway.
---
Killing 5 mobs between quests is less boring than grinding 500 mobs later on.
---
&gt;dispel is basically the scariest spell anybody has. "look at me, I'm a mage, just prancing around and shatter comboing people, hey hey hey, where the fuck is my ice barrier, how did that warrior get out of that frost nove, oh fuck me, 20 seconds until respawn."
---
As a Mage main, this rustles my jimmies.
---
Wouldn't Benedictus just insta-gib them?
---
There are fews things more infuriating as a mage than gathering up 10+ mobs into a nice AoE and then getting jumped by someone. 
---
Genius!
---
You dont use spirit at all
---
Well I guess the Kiting of Kazzak to SW is the most extreme example of this.
---
I love that these apply to Overwatch too. As an Ana main the amount if bitching targetted at my dps is amazing. Never had a tank or other support complain..
---
FOR THE HORDE! 
---
I loved your story! I've been relatively lucky in this world when it comes to heavy losses. My mom lost both hands/feet and almost died because of sepsis but that's the greatest tragedy that's happened to my immediate family thus far. I am also excited for Classic WoW and ready to waste away with it. I will drink deeply from Azeroth and just completely disengage with it all.
---
Its what MMO's are about lol.
---
Also, not many warriors actually went deep prot for tanking. A lot of their talents are garb
---
I'm proud of you. You give us Warlocks a good name managing to overcome Molten Core with only half of your body. I hope you get to show Ragnaros a downright walloping this time. Show him what you can do now that you're back to fighting strength!
---
I think its balls in the mouth, its just hard to represent in a game :D 
---
You seem like a stable individual.
---
You're an inspiration and I'm proud to have you as a fellow member of the Horde.
---
Not in my groups. When I’m tanking if others pull without me asking them to they won’t be sticking around long. They think they’re speeding up the run but in reality they die, cause wipes and extra downtime. If they’d just let the tank pull the healer would heal less people less often and let us get onto the next pack faster! 
---
But damn. Four times on rfc? Feels bad man 
---
I do it because i cant really immerse myself into a female character. Also i want people i meet to know i am a guy.
---
This is my plan as Orc.
---
He pretty much made 80% of his subbase by posting here, back then i tried to question wether it violated rules and got downvoted into oblivion. He also opened a patreon account when he had like 2000subs lol already asking for money. 
---
The size of the Wolves is only increased in size/coolness when a Tauren rides them. I plan on playing an orc with a hilariously small baby kodo.
---
Shamans can tank up until the high 40's and low 50's.
---
You sound like the healer variant of me tanking. Keep pulling? Go ahead and do that boss with you tanking bro. I'll pick up the pieces when you die. 
---
Ox needs to come back to the game.
---
I can only play good looking characters in WoW because I am good looking. 
---
I don't know man, it's like they are making up arguments for the sake of "nO cHangEs" and don't know jack of what they're talking about
---
I think OP meant 1.11
---
You've got that the other way around dude, just let that sink in for a moment. You're trying to bring back poliomyelitis
---
Alliance scum 
---
Damn, then why did we change looting after tbc? We know it doesn't work
---
Tickets about what, exactly?
---
These type of posts always make me cringe hard.
---
Your souls will fuel my magics!
---
I thought they would release 1.12 in its full glory right away. If Classic is here to stay (which I hope it is), progressive release of content doesn't really make sense.
---
And that's great, having friends actually matters!
---
\*Doubt\*
---
Swipe does shitty damage anyway. OTOH a warrior or paladin tank would really like a similarly tanky guy AOE tanking hordes of non-elites so the healers/clothies dont get hit at all.
---
Here's something that'll shock you:
---
People used addons in vanilla. Just because you didn't doesn't mean it wasn't a popular thing even back then. So you just want your personal vanilla experience, fuck everyone else, right?
---
My problem with progressive itemization is that it affects low-level items, which don't have any effect on Molten Core difficulty.
---
Best example would be Seal of Wrynn.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=2933
---
As you can see it is sutable basically for any class and really good for hybrids.
---
But before patch it is an item of uncommon quality (green) that gives you +2 stamina and +6 spirit. A generous reward for long quest chain that require you to complete two dungeons (Deadmines and Stockades), isn't it?
---
Another good example would be abscence of items at BG vendors. You could do low level BGs, say on level 29, and then use upgrades for these items every 10 levels throughout all your leveling process. I did that on Nost and it felt good. I felt rewarded for my hard work as I had upper hand in world PvP because of those items.
---
&gt;It's often not even their fault, but 90% of the time it is the healer complaining about bad dps than vice versa (even if the healer is right).
---
Only time i hear healer complain is, when the tank pulls and the healer is completely oom at pull. And then gets blamed for not healing.
---
Said like someone who has never played Vanilla
---
&gt; people will just prefarm the best gear and have it instantly the second the patch goes live.
---
1) This hasn't happened in a large scale on private servers for the past several years. Why would it suddenly start now? People have lives you know. Tryhards might start a few days or even weeks before the patch but most people don't bother because there's just no rush.
---
2) Many (dare I say most?) of the good "new" items didn't even drop in earlier patches, so you couldn't farm them before their release anyway.
---
What’s weird about role playing the gender you identify with? It’s a fantasy game, outlandish races are what makes it cool. If you were an alien, would you be a girl alien? 
---
I find it strange when guys say, “I like to look at a virtual chicks ass, not a virtual male ass!” If you’re looking at the ass of your male character instead of the rest of your screen, something is off. 
---
I know we're in video game land here but it always made me wonder how eating a slice of bread after being brutally attacked by several axe wielding maniacs would make it all better.
---
They wish they was a shaman! 
---
It will increase it. Go nyehh yourself.
---
Give this man a medal!
---
That's what they get for playing Horde.
---
A place where alliances were broken...
---
an 10
---
I'm thinking of buying the HP Omen 15' it's around $800 and should be pretty decent for WoW. i5 2.3Hz + 8GBRam &amp;  GTX Geforce 1060
---
I believe it should do the trick quite well
---
mistakes during loot distribution  
---
This elitist mindset is NOT REQUIRED IN CLASSIC
---
That's just what so many people get so wrong. Find a good group of people and by that I'm mostly referring to their attitude. Play with those people and you'll see all content. AQ/Naxx may require a generally better player group but even then, as long as you perform well, there's no issue playing any specc whatsoever.
---
Classic isn't tuned the way that current retail is. Classic is tuned about total numbers and nothing else. Guild that require "ultra best specc and perfect items" will be bored SO FAST. I'll just play whatever I want (this time around actually feral druid, too) and I'll enjoy all the content. No matter what wannabe-number-crunchers are gonna tell me, I'll enjoy it all. I've done so in vanilla and I'll do so in classic...
---
fml, I edited it like 5 times. At first it was 8, and therefore an, but I forgot about that.  
---
But let's let it stay in to trigger people like "rouge".
---
&gt;Here's something that'll shock you:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;People used addons in vanilla.
---
No. Really? I totally didn't notice when I was mindlessly spamming a single button to decurse the entire raid.
---
Addons are a massive crutch. If you get triggered by my pointing that out, then too fucking bad.
---
If you can't do without 2018 Addons in a 2005 game, it's you who doesn't really want vanilla.
---
If you have 1.12 itemisation immediately it's not just that raids become way easier, but that class balance changes too. For example, with access to titanic leggings right near the very start, fury warriors will mostly skip devilsaur entirely and top dps meters very quickly. All that hit gear also means melee dps will make hunters do trash tier dps very fast.
---
Hard counters, weird power creep, oneshots, non-viability of a lot of  specs, very strong profession dependence (Engineering).
---
Even though vanilla balance is imperfect, it is certainly fun. 
---
&gt;viable for dps
---
Even hardcore dps druids with R12-13 sets barely beat dedicated hunters. It's not like they actually compete with fury warriors or rogues.
---
&gt; What’s weird about role playing the gender you identify with?
---
There's nothing weird or strange about picking any gender, any race or any class to me.  
---
What I do find weird is that people apply the logic: "I can only play a male character in WoW because I am a male IRL" when they are literally playing a fantasy game, and at the same time, they have no issues playing some weird/strange monstrosity of a character, even though they're obviously human IRL. But that logic apparently only applies to the gender, and that is what I find funny.  
---
&gt;“I like to look at a virtual chicks ass, not a virtual male ass!”  
---
Well to me that is just a bad joke. If people honestly think like that, or make decisions based on that, then it sound rather primitive lol. There's 1000 things to be aware of in game, and what you apparently can't stop staring at is the arse of your virtual character? I have a difficult time believing that, whence it is just a bad joke.  
---
 
---
What did I say that was elitist? It's true. Druids have to put in a lot of work and face a lot of stigma, are you going to disagree with me on that? I never said nobody should play feral lmao. 
---
Stop projecting your weird idea that anyone who understands that one class is better than another is "elitist", I welcome all the hybrids and I agree people should play what they find fun. 
---
The quests will be available to you yes.
---
Execute spamming on vael is just so fun! Even with suboptimal gear you see yourself potentially pulling threat, it's great!
---
Na, it’s not a joke. It was the argument always given for why they play female characters. 
---
I’ll put it this way. When I want to imagine myself as a different race, my gender never changes. I think, “I want to be a power ranger! Hmm.. green, red, blue, or black ranger?” When I imagined myself being a pro athlete as a kid, I was never playing in the WNBA. 
---
I don’t judge and I enjoyed playing tomb raider, too, when you didn’t have a choice about playing as a girl. Never thought about it or questioned it. But when given the choice to create myself in a virtual world as something from my imagination, it was natural to pick a male character. 
---
/shrug
---
In one of interviews one of class designers from that era told that they had to little time so there was a lot of compromises. A good example are hybrid classes - their got their stigma that was "confirmed" with gear that was printed for them - healing - and it was healing because that what more competitive players wanted at that time. With TBC they did add/change some of hybrid spec talents as well as print more fitting gear allowing them to be more in line with "pure" classes. Pretty much those talents and interactions fixed it, not straight number buffs that would not solve the problem. Vanilla class design wasn't really "bad", was just unfinished :)
---
I need to order an old screen for this ratio so I can get the true experience! LOVE everything about this
---
This plus the mobility question. A \~14" will be ultra portable while 17" will give the best immersion (or some old 18,4" for extra retro-gaming points).
---
I was always told that affliction was better for warlock leveling.
---
holy shit, that could wreck all kinds of chaos in Northshire Valley... almost makes me want to start up a warlock, just to give newbies the first taste of "pvp".
---
I'd also consider adding in a bio break and letting them ghost run instead of ressing.
---
Warrior is the only hybrid that is top tier in both of it's roles all the way through the game until the end.
---
There won't be "progressive itemization" so this is moot. (I won't get into how good or bad it would be...)
---
Blizzard has the 1.12 data and not much else. They said it explicitly. They also said they'll "hold the data almost sacrosanct". And I *really* (I mean **really**) doubt they'll try and piece together some hodge-podge database of item changes from outside sources...
---
SSDs are very cheap nowadays and they make a huge difference.
---
Sharding. Cash shop. Right click report. Tokens.
---
So was it any good? I'm thinking of getting that cook book.
---
The only way I can see that argument having any weight is if you talk about patterns/enchants that become available and since its all known ahead of time, you can farm all the mats way early and save them for the patch release day.
---
I think it is the lesser of two evils though. 
---
A lot of classes are forced into certain roles since some specs are so far behind performance-wise, they might as well not exist. The most common complaint is that Druids, Paladins, Shamans and Priests are all more or less forced into their healing specs in PvE content (with the odd exception here and there), their DPS specs struggle to keep up with others either because of mana problems or simply just not outputting enough damage, while the wonky tank designs for Palas and Druids leave Warriors as practically the only choice at top level. Sometimes the issue was also as simple as not enough great gear being available to try and make these specs viable, and this only became an even bigger issue when tier sets were only designed with the already viable specs in mind.
---
Rotations are also incredibly simple, the most infamous is Frost Mages' in this regard as it's literally just spamming Frostbolt while making sure you don't go oom.
---
I don't think it's as awful as a lot of people say though, I think often times when people complain about it, in their heads they take Vanilla's class design and put it into retail's context, where it'd be a lot worse than it is in Vanilla's framework. I personally think class identity is at its peak in Vanilla as every class has such clear distinctions from each other, a class always brings something different to a group or a raid that no one else does. The "meta" we ended up with is still fairly enjoyable for this reason imo, even if it leaves something to be desired on the class fantasy side.
---
With that said, there's no doubt that TBC just did things better, it kept a lot of the positives of Vanilla's design, while it massively helped the underperforming specs, creating a far more diverse experience both in solo and group content. It more or less just finished Vanilla's job for it.
---
Those guys are role models.
---
Myself as well honestly.
---
Besides warrior each class has a role rather than each spec.
---
It is mostly to do with how more hybrid classes were given more options for how they played raids. Personally I prefer vanilla balancing, but that's just me.
---
&gt;people will just prefarm the best gear and have it instantly the second the patch goes live.
---
I don't even see why this is bad, really. Using knowledge to gain an edge on others is fun. If I can do this I'll just feel happy knowing that I used my knowledge to easily get an item that probably everyone else is forming groups for to farm right now.
---
As someone who gets very invested into games, I tend to find that the games that entertain me the most is ones that have illogical or non-intuitive elements in it. Casual players fail to notice ways to exploit those elements, while advanced players can utilise them to their advantage.
---
A game in which everything is completely straight-forward to the point where guides are entirely unnecessary are just entirely bland. Being able to continuously discover new things because the game doesn't hold your hand the entire way is great.
---
I played on Alleria with this Warlock.  He got his account compromised frequently if I recall and didn't play much longer after BC.  Fun having a celb on your server sometimes and I wished he made more videos.
---
Yes but what you have on shift-9 or ctrl-9?
---
Initial **Spirit of Aquementas** that lowered mana cost was changed too.
---
I identify as an attack helicopter, yet I don’t have options for that. C’mon Blizzard, it’s 2018.
---
Done. 
---
Do you think earth worm Jim reproduced asexually? Why’s he gotta be a dude? 
---
Implying spite isn't 90% of why 
---
Trinkets (and other items with on-use effects) should be fixed now and won't show up as 'Updated in patch 1.10' if it was just a cooldown category change.
---
Said a druid player who never cleared end game content
---
Food bring happiness and a good mood is said to help you heal faster.
---
imagine thinking attackhelicopter jokes are funny. cmon dude, its 2018
---
Or you can solo kite him on a warlock 
---
I still think it's an absolutely despicable thing to do. Sure, it's not against the TOS so there rightfully weren't any bans, but it's still despicable. 
---
Someone died in real life and it was the guild's way of dealing with the horrible, **real** loss of a friend. You don't shit like that on people trying to cope with their grief, even if it seems silly to you. The grief is real, the act of playing the game this way was actually a way of real-life grief handling. 
---
"PvP server rules" and "faction war" don't mean shit in this moment. To me it's part of basic human decency to let people grieve as they see fit as long as they don't harm anybody. 
---
I still have the feeling that many people don't get this was primarily a real life issue, not some game meme. 
---
It's hard to recall at this point, though I think we'll all get our fair share of reminding lol
---
Weird bois just need to accept that they’re weird bois and there’s nothing wrong with it.
---
Oh Look a cata Kid posting
---
I second this
---
As a healer main. Fuck y'all.
---
And also if you die I will res you, but if everyone dies and everyone but you runs back I ain't doing shit till you've ran or your gone.
---
If you're not American, keep in mind that everything is in ounces, cups and pounds. Really confusing but there are measuring cutlery that shows both systems. 
---
You wont be in a semi-hc guild that is required to clear AQ/Naxx doing subpar dps.
---
You can call that whatever you want, but thats just the way it is. 
---
FLAME! DEATH! DESTRUCTION! 
---
It’s the best game in existence
---
He made a ton but not all of them are good. I love Hard like Heroic and Assassinate.. and Ni Hao. Ah shit he was pretty good wasn't he? 
---
I agree that when everybody zergs the endboss that it takes some of the fun out of AV. Premade groups are not going to change this, though - you are just as likely to encounter a group of randoms who are there to farm honor with a quick game.
---
Personally, I say just wait for release. It's a little while away but it's worth it.
---
I've seen undead going straight to Mulgore to quest on launch day due to zones being overwhelmed. Exploring experience on the way is also handy.
---
Patch Adams approves.
---
Hi, /u/Hetz_
---
Just take any 2D vector graphic you can find and convert it to the format the CNC software can read. That's about it. You can also convert pixelgraphics into vector files.
---
Did you try any of these things yet?
---
I mean... Only dps 1 is an "idiot". Dps 2 just politely declined.
---
the warlock bit was the best
---
I'm confused, what exactly made me come off as unstable? o.O
---
Well i heard some people not liking the look &amp; feel of the current launcher. Also i want to update the news articles in the launcher to reflect the latest news with regards to Classic. I also hope to recreate some of the nostalgia feeling for some of the people and last but not least, it's a nice learning experience for me. Which for me is the biggest thing i get from this. I never built a 'native' app (except internally used ones) before so this is a good learning experience. I recreate lost of WoW related software just a learning experience (e.g. Thotbott clone, vanilla server, vanilla wow forums, stuff like that). I understand that people see this as a waste of time, but for me it isn't :)
---
It’s a fantasy game. Why would I be what I am when I can experience something new?
---
Yea.. shame Blizz has just let every possible name be swallowed up on all the servers and don't do anything about it. Makes the world less engaging when there are so many "Peniiswallows" and shit running around..
---
imagine thinking at all. cmon dude its not even 2020
---
Right click reporting/autobanning will ruin classic.
---
You can’t make up days lost on the scepter bearer/PvP rank grind.
---
Actually.. they do.
---
Seriously, think about it. What class in retail can't self heal? Every single one of them can.
---
Can’t jump while levitating. Would be minor annoyance to all night elves, and bug rogues trying to stealth since it made them easier to see
---
May I see a video of that? Genuinely curious as I've never heard about that. 
---
A few PvP related questions :
---
I know that hunters are on top of the food chain when it comes to PvP during leveling,but what are they like at max level ? Specifically,1v1 wPvP / duels in a perfect scenario . I keep getting "contradictory" information on this one.
---
How well do they scale with AQ/Naxx gear compared to other classes in PvP ?
---
Any classes/specs to avoid at all costs ?  Or everything is beatable with enough effort ( read,engineering and consumables ) .
---
Weirdboi detected
---
Same with right click report that will silence some spammers. It can be abused but the advantages are there. 
---
Ye my bad. So lifetime of Scourge invasion back then was only few weeks? Thats bummer to hear, so really nice levelling items
---
Lmao omg.  I forgot that we couldn't see opponent's buffs in vanilla.  Man, the game changed so much.
---
Sure, if everyone is a piece of shit like you that is a super tryhard about a 14 year old game, it will cause problems. But if that is the case, the community will be so fucking toxic that the game will suck regardless of loot trading. 
---
Yeah it was a prelude to Naxxramas raid basically.
---
Good post. Exactly my feelings.
---
More fun than someone who plays wow obsessively, provably. 
---
Thanks for your honesty
---
Yeah, because you're a medieval magic-wielding man living in a world with demons, zombies, dragons, elementals and rock monsters anyway.
---
No one looks at the Witcher series and goes "Oh, wow. Look. They're humans like us too. That's a really boring setting".
---
 The reason why medieval human themes are so popular is because you're able to put yourself in the shoes of the characters and enjoy the experience far more.
---
Maybe the ONLY similarity between humans in wow and present humans IRL are the fact that they have the same anatomy.
---
I challenge you to find someone with forearms that large.
---
&gt; What now?
---
You make it sound like I claimed NO ONE use dkp when in reality I wrote "no one"... 
---
You found one! Impressive. Can you find one more?
---
My claim is still that "no one" is using dkp in vanilla.
---
That's up to your guild to decide. If they are pulling that shit then they probably have a history of other toxicity and you can probably justify removing them. If it happens in a pug, sucks to suck, ML should be more careful and you should really get with a guild.
---
Oh wow, image macros memes aged like milk.
---
The pet requires 1/4 of XP required for a character to level up.
---
That's wrong though ;o

Antivaxxers are heavily biased and refuse to vaccinate their kids because they have heard anecdotes from other people about anaphylactic shocks and are trusting in pseudo science. Pro-loottraders are heavily biased because they can only see the positive of loot trading, which is avoiding accidentally misplaced and subsequently wasted gear.  
---
They're completely ignoring the fact that actual science has weighed the two against eachother based on actual data, instead of some anecdote from a friend of a friend, and found one option to be the lesser of two evils.
---
My brother reminded me of Nyhm in a party chat the other day and I was instantly flung back to a better time. It was beautiful, every one on the Zeppelin applauded.
---
They can do it diablo style were only new dropped items get the new stats
---
Some people simply like the look of the female models more, be they the animations or just the general looks. 
---
It doesn't have to be an identity thing, most people don't even think about that sort of thing when they make a character, they just pick what looks good and roll with it. 
---
Got the cookbook as a christmas gift and everything I have tried is pretty good.
---
Maybe biased but their mixed drinks are all great so far. 
---
They should still be near the top of the food chain in wPvP because hunters don't really have a caught-with-their-pants-down moment like other classes do. I know that PvE dps does drop for hunters with end game gear compared to other classes, but in PvP they should still be pretty good because they still have their full kit, skills and abilities that make them such a menace. Of course hunters do have a dead-zone so if the opponent is skilled they can cause you a lot of grief, but in my experience at max lvl pvping in Burning Crusade (didn't get there in vanilla T\_T) hunters are still a bugger and can burst very nicely, plus they have great kiting ability. Definitely beatable though, if you practice enough against a hunter with your class you can get a good feel for how to win. I was a mage and had a hunter mate, we sparred all the time, and often in wPvP if I came across a hunter and I had my cooldowns I could win, just keep nice and close in the dead-zone. 
---
X
---
I think mage would have a slight advantage over spriest in the sense that if you aren't dying, then you have less downtime overall and can last on the longer fights with bosses that require some kiting. You might be right though that spriest will do more burst with a lock friend. 
---
The most advantage from the mage comes from the polymorphs and freezes. Me and my hunter friend only were able to do Inner Maraudon because we had pets to help tank and in some cases individually deal with up to 6 or so enemies at once. We had freeze traps on 2, pets on 2, us on 2 or 3. It was awesome lol.
---
If you went spriest/lock, you have fear and possibly a charm if the mob is humanoid. But fearing mobs can get dicey quick lol. So you'd be relying more on pure dps and luck than consistently being able to control the loose mobs. Maybe I'm wrong though and there's a way I'm not thinking about :P I still think its doable, but will be challenging in some areas.
---
And yeah I said we were level 40's ish...I just remember my hunter *was* a level 39 twink so I had pretty much BiS gear at the time. I decided I wanted to level him finally and couldn't have been higher than 42 or so I'm thinking... I remember princess at the end was still higher level than I was. My friend might have been the same level or close too :P
---
End game: there is always a minimum of two hunters in every raid due to enrage/tranq shot mechanics. In early MC Hunters are king of the dps charts. A fresh 60 hunter will out dps every other fresh 60 class. As you progress in raiding you will fall further down the dps chart because Hunters dont scale as well as other classes with gear. However there are always slots available. In 60 dungeons you offer fairly good cc in the form of frost trap (resistable, but no trash npc type is immune) and if you are BM hunter your pet can off tank which is a form of CC. Non BM hunter pets tend to die quickly when trying to off tank dungeons. Some specific dungeon groups may request other range dps because of better cc, but hunters can fill the dps/cc roll in all dungeons
---
For gold farming Hunters are great, go BM and you can kill pretty much anything that isnt a world boss and can solo some dungeons.
---
Oh hohoho not a chance, when I heal I completely abuse my omnipotence, if you live it’s because I healed you and if you die it’s because I deemed you not worthy of life, maybe you should play better, unless you’re the tank then it was lag. 
---
I prefer vanilla too. Raids aren't the only content in game. I like how different classes act differently on a bigger scale than just a simple bossfight.
---
Unless a mutual understanding is in place, deliberately (or inattentively) standing in fire lands a person on the low priority list too. My mana and time spent casting is too valuable to waste on someone refusing to move out of the bad stuff,so I move on to other, higher priority targets (not necessarily the tank) if they come up ;o  
---
So like a combination of a ton of things I guess :o
---
Druids are great, levelling is a blast once you get cat form and you have a multitude of abilities for any situation. 
---
However once you cap you'll run into some issues, for one most raid teams only bring 2 Druids, 3 at most so you'll have issues finding a reliable spot. Then there is the issue of respeccing to farm when you're not raiding as 90% of your talent points will be spent in the resto tree you'll be very weak in combat. 
---
A common strategy is to either farm herbs and sell them or make potions with them to make your money, or acquire a decent melee dps set and simply don't respec, it's not as good obviously but it gets the job done and it saves you a ton of gold.
---
If you're primary objective is to PvP then you will have an easy time finding a premade group as you are the best WSG flag runner since you have both cat and travel form, that as well as goblin rocket boots from engineering. When you're not running flags you'll be healing. You can theoretically spec Balance or Feral for some variety but they aren't that great until you have some really good gear.
---
Overall the Druid is a solid class if you're comfortable with the idea that you'll be mostly healing at end game. 
---
Hi brother! Could you please pick the class/race for me as well? I love this!
---
I wrote "no one". I used the irony quotation marks to point out that someone is indeed using dkp, but "no one" is using it. As in, irony, "", its called irony quotation. The meaning is, hardly any guild is using this old outdated inefficent loot system, "no one"...
---
Mining eng, then herb alch. I mean assum ijng I have the time to. I want to make so much arcanite!
---
For 4, if the server pops are at only like 5k or less it won't even be an issue: I'll just skip a quest or three and tag mobs for xp in the starting zone then carry on as per normal.
---
If you aren't basically the guild leader or otherwise the top and most consistent player in your guild then don't bother imo.
---
Things might change later on if naxx goes on farm, but until then it's just too insane.
---
2019 addons are _weaker_ than 2005 addons. 2005 addons would literally play the game for you. Decursive has been gimped and isn't at all as good anymore with the 2019 API.

That's literally what they did.

Thanks for the disappointment :D

You'll gain some from travel tho
---
No subtitles tho
---
&gt; What did I say that was elitist? It's true.  
---
It may be true, but most players don't give a damn. You would be kind to keep that for you.
---
Considering OP stole someone else's post, I don't think they can give you an answer. 
---
You're the kind of hero we need but don't deserve, kind sir or madam!
---
Your skill in Cooking has increased to 2.
---
It was my pleasure.
---
I don't really understand most of those arguments. Oneshots are just part of life, had counters are fixed by a friend that hard counters them and profession dependence is a known mechanic.
---
If you want to PvP, you have engineering. Just one of the hard choices that make choices meaningful.
---
I even agreed that feral can pull good numbers, I just said they require so much effort, which is not elitist at all? I'm honestly confused as to why that's seen as elitist to say? It would be elitist if i said "omegalul feral is trash just play fury".

Banana bread tastes a whole lot better when the bananas were hard fought for in Stranglethorn

You don´t log in a videogame to mourn if you are serious about it. Like you said it is real, and so should you meet in real life too. Otherwise don´t complain when others still play the game like it is supposed to. 
---
Begin my rein over Un'Goro Crater.
---
Obviously there will be limits, otherwise everyone would just play on shard 1 and we will get to where we started. And if there are limits, some people will be left behind. With sharding you're not getting transcended into another dimension, you're actually playing on your own shard for a long time, until you decide to join someone from another shard or travel into another zone. And without LFR it won't happen often.
---
Well I never plan to raid so jokes on them but I do wish there was more visual progression for druids like dire cat form with more pristling hair and scars.
---
same here as rogue. but i will start engi + mining and then maybe change mining for something else (maybe enchanting or bs)
---
It comes out WITH Naxx. 
---
Yeah... I'm sticking to dungeons and I personally categorize consumables like potions, elixirs, and flasks different than soul shards and ammo. 
---
You don't get to decide what kind of mourning other people do is serious. Who do you think you are telling other people how to grieve? 
---
You don't even know the circumstances, maybe they could not afford the travel? Anyway, it doesn't even matter. Why they chose to mourn this way is none of your business. They had their reasons and if you're a decent human being you respect how people mourn even if you'd do it differently. 
---
What everyone fails to think of is that the starting area for Mulgore is quite a bit bigger and the quests tend to be pretty spread out in Mulgore.  Durotar and Tirisfal both have much better XP/travel time ratios.
---
What you are describing is H1Z1 with a WoW skin/map. This kind of mashup would no longer resemble WoW, except maybe the stuff on the surface.
---
Its not just that some classes are forced into certain roles, its that even those roles are half baked. Resto Druids do not play like people think they play, they do not run around and throw HOTs, instead they spam Healing Touch, as its the most efficient heal they have. Basically they are Paladins with green spells instead of yellow.
---
So even if you manage to convert the countless Ferals and Balance Druids into healing, they have a high chance of getting bored and just rolling a Rogue (Feral) or Mage (Balance)
---
Classic will suffer the same issues as Vanilla did back then: Lack of tanks and healers. This impacts everyone, and without a LFG tool (which we are strongly against), it means you will be hanging around town waiting for a group to form, sometimes for hours.
---
Some of you may think that your experiences on a private server are some sort of indication that the problem wont be that bad. But i disagree, private servers tend to have very hardcore players who are very comfortable playing all sorts of specs. When you get a huge influx of less hardcore players, you are going to see a ocean of Mages, Rogues, DPS Warriors and Hunters.
---
The problem with half baked specs, is that even if you avoid them and roll a Rogue or Mage or Warrior, you are still going to suffer the consequences. In raids you will be competing with 8 other Mages for the same loot, in dungeons you will be waiting hours for a group to form. "Just make friends" is somewhat true, but there are simply limited amount of tanks and healers per sheer vast number of DPSers. Even if you do make friends with some and have a consistent group, it does not mean the problem is not there, its just that you avoided it.
---
Further compounding the problem is that dedicated tanks and healers simply gear up faster, due to less competition for loot and far easier times getting into raids and groups. While you wait for your group to form, they have done 2 dungeons already. Eventually those players no longer desire to do LBRS or whatever, as they have all the gear they want. Meaning a small pool of tanks and healers are already smaller, and you may have to take in players who are significantly under geared or inexperienced as you have no other choice
---
I Just said above? long-cd abilities, consumables and other shit.
---
Can't forget the healer screaming at the Warlock to please god just stop Life Tapping for 10 seconds.
---
I've been looking at numbers and it really seems that dungeon tanking is so close! If 'Anticipation' or 'Toughness' had slightly better percentage increases it might be doable without changing anything else about the game.
---
Yeah that's just straight up laziness though. If they put in the extra effort I'm pretty sure most druids could do it. 
---
Nothing at all. I think the point of the OP is there is also nothing wrong with playing a different gender in a video game.
---
That's the most 2004 username I've ever seen haha.
---
Well, that was OP as fuck. No wonder it got nerfed.
---
I’m going Holy Priest so I’m taking enchanting. I found playing on private server I was selling a lot of greens that could’ve been leveling up my enchanting. For leveling - skinning. At 60 - tailoring. I might stick with that or take herbalism.
---
Tell the rogue to start fucking stunning targets so I don't have to heal so much, and tell the fucking hunter to turn pet taunt off.
---
My druid back in vanilla, and my shaman a year ago in private servers... You'd think after like 12 years people would stop being stupid idiots but no. 
---
WHY ARE YOU TAKING DAMAGE AS A MAGE?!?! And no, I'm not going to heal the lock that is at 1% life spamming life tap. I need my mana to keep our idiot tank alive who refuses to CC. I'm not trading my mana to a warlock so he can pull aggro and have to panic fear.
---
I can't wait to go back in.
---
I'm on board with this. I personally wouldn't crash the funeral, but the people who did were within their rights to do so.
---
I don't plan on raiding :)
---
Yes
---
I love priest, didnt live Pally. My brother has played pally for years though and always enjoyed it. I think the race choice is important since you'll be seeing your character everytime you play. So if you want human then do that, but dwarfs are pretty cool.
---
Professions really depend on you class. If you go priest, I'd say herb/alch or tailoring. Not really sure for pally.
---
self inserting in a video game  
---
yikes my dude  
---
Just start your own group. Easy when you're the tank.
---
That's how paladins get gear for raids.
---
Vanilla's definition of class balance was filling a single role in PvE and offering a few leveling/PvP focused talents. It irks people who enjoy the underdeveloped specs. It doesn't help that so many players obsess over raiding, so you have people saying not to worry cause you can still contribute and the raids aren't hard, but still get the stigma of playing an underpowered raid spec from the vanilla neckbeards
---
Burning Crusade had "better" class design because it made most specs raid viable, and in a way that kept or strengthened their identity. BC has its own issues but it's the best of both worlds for a lot of players
---
Thank you for sharing ❤
---
You mean autobanning is bad. A easier way to report retards has nothing to do with ruining the game.
---
Even if you put it behind 200 menus, they can still do it. 
---
A good rogue tank that pulls won't get hit, he'll pop evasion, a short'd kidney shot, or kits with crippling poison in circles forward the tank.
---
A bad rogue will die like the fucking stupid idiot he is.
---
Well I mean, theres people turning other people into sheep, so fast healing bread isnt the weirdest thing
---
My mage with atiesh. I don't care about anything else. And I don't care what happens haha.
---
&gt;BC has its own issues 
---
Could you please briefly describe what you think BC's main issues are?
---
It'll be fun until everyone starts getting Tier 2 and you get 2-3 shot by everyone because you refuse to heal in a guild. 
---
The reason he would start in the tauren area is most likely to gain as much reputation as possible when doing the 1-10 quests which put comfortably into honored. With phasing in place for the first week, changing the leveling area wouldnt be much of a bonus if you can do the quests in your home area just fine. 
---
So reputation loss due to this chain needs to be considered if you are on your merry way to the kodo mount.
---
They would never be close to hunter damage. Hunter is Tier 1 damage in MC/BWL/Early AQ and Tier 1 again in late Naxx. Stop talking shit about hunters when you have no clue like the rest of this sub. 
---
Druids do needle dick damage, stop comparing them to hunters. 
---
I like how you're questioning WoW food logic when this is the game where the world's top adventurers' collective solution to eating and drinking at the same time is to dump their food in the mug.
---
&gt; the data collected since its inception proves that ninjalooting and other malicious kinds of loot trading will be much more commonplace than it otherwise would have been
---
I'd like to see that proof, please. 
---
*shrug* Personally I just try to be a gracious healer.  I do my best to keep everyone alive, even when they do stupid and reckless things.  If a DPS pulls the next pack, I have a better chance of staying alive if all 4 other members of my party are alive, and if I pull threat on all the loose ones with my first heal, then, well, I hope I'm a good enough player and can pull a rabbit out of a hat.  Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.
---
I'll tell you one thing though.  I don't remember pulls where everything went right, but I do remember the ones where I can't *believe* we managed to not die.  
---
Tbh, in vanilla blizzard had very little experience in balancing such game. It had PVP and PVE sides, you had multiple classes, stats, buffs/debuffs and gear. They didnt understand how you could create a "perfect storm" and it would be totally OP. 
---
Additionally the talents didnt really work with gearing on so called hybrid classes, making most of them one trick ponys. Pally tank tree and they dont have a taunt. Or how other specs required a itemization that there really wasnt available or had horrible mana problems.
---
So they took those and somewhat fixed it. But they forgot to stop in future expansions. Adding every ability to every class.
---
It's a land crafted and sundered entirely by magic. Maybe food summons restorative magic from the Emerald Dream. Who knows?
---
Actually I prefer raptor mount heh. Just love question in mulgore is all
---
Aren't the blimps available? They were always there as far as I knew... But I joined about 1 year before BC.
---
This right here is the difference between a good rogue and a shite one. Rogues that try to maximize their dps are generally the worst because they don't stun or kick anything.
---
I’m referring to the outcome obviously. If they replaced the current system with an alternative that produces the same result then I would still draw issue with it.
---
So when I think about raid loot in MC, I remember every druid getting geared out in just a few runs. Feel like druid loot dropped eeeevery boss, and we usually only had 2 or 3 druids max. 
---
See: Warriors/Mages/Rogues loot issues
---
Raids are different than 5man-10man pugs. There is a chance that people will abuse this in pugs.
---
It's listed there. https://itemization.github.io/all/armor/held-in-off-hand/spirit-of-aquementas-11904.html
---
Ohh I thought only the numbers which I ve aswell but how do you press modifier and 9. Are you taking the hand away from WASD?
---
Flying mounts
---
Resilience meaning you spend 2x as long getting gear
---
Outlands having fucking horrid zones.
---
But maybe they are 10 feet tall cows? Who knows?
---
Like the old saying goes: "on the internet, nobody knows that you are a dog"
---
Yes, from the masterlooter but I mean in dungeons you can roll need, greed or disenchant. I remember you could not roll need on others if its not your main equip but it may have beennin tbc or wotlk.
---
As I said, I dont really use the 7-9 bindings because they are simply too far away to be reachable. I have them bound but I click them.
---
I forgot about this video... its good
---
Sweet, looks delicious! Love that book. I made Savory Deviate Delight a couple weeks ago, was so good I flipped out
---
Needing proof (in 2019) that humans are awful when they can stay anonymous. Really?  
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally?
---
Yeah jeez who hasn’t seen Gladiator
---
So no proof despite you explicitly claimed there's proof? 
---
This is a great point.  I've done it both ways, I've played a male human warlock that looked as close to me as I could make it.  I also leveled a female night elf priest simply because the design of the character was better.
---
I'll be playing a female night elf priest this go around, not the best racials, not a min/max character.  But I'll enjoy the game more and I'll have more fun, and at the end of the day that's the point of this game, isn't it?
---
Did it turn you into a pirate or a ninja?
---
Hey bud, do you mind sharing some of your planned 25-30 grinding spots? If you don't want to then I understand, Classic is going to be competitive on mob tagging. 
---
Huh, nevermind then :D Just really looked that way. 
---
By the ancestors!
---
I recently leveled a sham on a pserver up to 35 before I decided to save the rest of the game for classic and I successfully tanked WC, SFK, RFK And Gnomer. 
---
Frankly shaman can hold aggro on 1-2 mobs even better than a warrior in the low levels. However having a mage is pretty necessary because both you and the healer will have to drink kind of a lot and the sheeps are huge.
---
Focus on stacking agility and take the defensive talents and your golden. I think I was up to about 24% dodge and 12% block already by 32
---
Sure like the facebook kids who change their profile picture to a french flag after terrorism. It is the internet that created that non commital, low effort stuff. If you asked them to meet up they would all flake like "nah on second thought I´m not that hurt about it." This is what pisses me of about our time and age. 
---
To be fair you're kind of missing the ball by putting an "intended purpose" on each spec in the first place. Like for mages, the only real constant is that deep arcane is never used for levelling, and deep fire is never used for PvP (deep as in 31+ points). Aside from that...
---
* For levelling: deep frost or even pure frost. Fire is a popular alternatively for people that dislike Frost levelling
---
* 31/0/20 for PvE up to AQ
---
* 20/0/31 or 21/0/30 for PvE up to AQ (one-off Winter's Chill bitch)
---
* 17/31/3 for PvP from AQ onward
---
* 17/0/34 is the standard go-to for PvP
---
* 0/24/27 and 31/20/0 are popular choices for PvP too
---
* 21/0/30 is less commonly seen but powerful and strong in PvP too
---
* 21/30/0 (take points from fire for Elemental Precision as needed) is a rare choice for PvP, but it is used
---
So really unless you're just trying to boil it down to the most commonly used spec for levelling/PvE/PvP respectively, the overview is pretty useless because just about everything exists and is used. The list would be more manageable by stating what you shouldn't do if anything.
---
While patrolling definitely helps the situation. I feel like if you just cross paths again it’s not camping. Fair game. 
---
Mages don’t, that’s the one i can think of off the top of my head. 
---
Mages. Non-Affliction Warlocks. 
---
To this day, at least once a week, something in my life occurs that leads me to think “how fortuitous... usually I must leave my lair to feed.”
---
What a bad ass thing to say when 40 assholes who can barely dress themselves show up to try to kill you
---
This is the content I come to this sub for.
---
See that’s what I’m saying
---
- searches through his bags for food...nope, not the mount, nope not the entire dps equip...ah yes the never spoiling bread.
---
- sits down to eat while his weapon is magnetically - but hovering at some distance - stuck to his back
---
- continues to kill van cleef with his group. EVERYBODY loots a head.
---
- wonders about the healing probabilities of food
---
&gt; Sure like the facebook kids who change their profile picture to a french flag after terrorism.
---
Yeah, that's totally comparable to losing a friend you personally knew, most likely have known for quite a while and at least chatted with, more likely also talked with frequently. 
---
You've proven you don't understand the situation at all. 
---
and what a friend that was, worth logging in a videogame and not setting a foot outside. You don´t understand a thing. 
---
P.S. peep ya boi Sokaero (me) in the raid groups, and also, take a moment to appreciate all the great names that people used to give their characters.
---
P.P.S. Notice "Insanejoker" in the Rogues. His original name was Insanetoker, but he was reported and a GM made him change it, so he changed it to Insanesmoker. A few months later he was again forced by GMs to change it, so he took Insanejoker. He was haunted by that name choice for the rest of the time that I knew him, as people would *constantly* ask him to tell a funny joke. He couldn't go into a 5-man without being asked, and if he didn't stay stealthed in Orgrimmar, he'd get hit up for jokes, especially if he was in populated areas like the bank/mailbox/AH trifecta.
---
Hunters aren't Tier 1 damage in any raids; they are pretty good in MC/BWL though before they completely drop off.
---
&gt; Magmadar
---
I joined a guild that worked its way up from ZG to MC and we were stuck on Magmadar for a few weeks before finally downing him. I still remember the day we finally did, we were so excited and relieved at the same time and didn't get stuck on another boss until Rag, I left before they ever down him. 
---
Mag was really the only boss that really stood out to me as far as "intimidation factor" goes because my guild was stuck on him for so long, and the next guild I joined was an AQ guild, who got stuck on Princess H, but by the time I joined raiding for them was starting to wind down because TBC was coming out. 
---
you bring a bunch of warriors, rogues, and mages to a raid.
---
you take about 2-3 hunters.  
---
Why the f would u want to do quests in Mulgore. It HAS to have the furthest running distance out of all starter areas. 
---
Yeah, this sub is seriously deluded if that post has upvotes and I've been downvoted.
---
Do they not remember?
---
for a fresh server the starting zone would be the best spot for it.
---
when the server matures and you want to grief lowbies then you can camp red ridge/tarren mill
---
&gt;As someone who normally leads DPS
---
Means absolutely nothing, you could be top dps in one guild and then be the worst dps in a better guild. 
---
&gt;The only people who should even have it installed
---
The more people that have it installed the more accurate of a read you can get.
---
&gt; Not to admonish people but to identify
---
No one said anything about using them to rag on people. Using dps meters and being an asshole are two entirely different things.
---
&gt;People that talk about meters or gear score openly
---
Can't compute, gear score isn't a thing in vanilla please go back to retail. 
---
Until the introduction of the Blood Elf.. 
---
dungeon tanking is no problem for shamans. everything until ubrs is np at all. my buddy sometimes even tanks dmt runs in ele spec.
---
I don't plan on raiding.
---
I saw someone say this about Human players..
---
Real human V's Real Orc... no challenge.
---
Get out of my head.
---
mages also want their oh available. There are a few good oh for mages that allow them to break cc and what not.
---
They used to have heal on evocation at one point though
---
I completed every raid in retail as a hunter. This is me doing 4h and getting top 5. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HUzWiQF1fMg
---
A well played hunter stacked with gear is tier 1 in most raid bosses, and tier 2 in late aq/early naxx. It was easy to get top 5 in mc/bwl. 
---
Don’t use private server bullshit, everything is broken allowing some classes to do 2-3x dmg than in retail.

It doesn't take a fucking genius to know this by heart at this point in time, and I'm pretty sure you're just being pedantic to troll for a reaction, humans are trash when they think their actions have no consequences.
---
I've seen videos of Shaman tanks at 60 but it's rare and I don't (currently) have friends planning on playing classic so convincing a healer to group might be tough.
---
right, I forgot about skull or the fubolg healing offhand ,etc. 
---
Yup. That is what my summer will look like. Completely logical.
---
You will have fun until people start stacking tier 2 then you will hate the game. When I hit tier 3 in retail I was able to 2-3 shot druids in blues.
---
HEY! I KNOW U
---
For your class you got the Otter card in reverse. This is indicating that you need to remove fear from your life, which makes me think you are meant to play a healer that can remove fear from you, like a shaman with tremor totem. Either that or play a Warrior that can stance dance out of fear.
---
For your race card you got Bat in reverse, which talks about rebirth in a cave. This makes me think of the orc and troll starting area in Durotar where there is that cave. Rebirth also reconfirm shaman for me, so I think you are meant to play either a troll or an orc shaman.
---
Is it possible to get a list of his gear and talents?
---
I'm always surprised that once a healer dies, suddenly everyone seems very capable of surviving trough everything.
---
you are correct about farming alts but i would have to disagree with there being a lack of raiding hunters.
---
It was over a decade ago, so the videos probably remember better than I do! The altar doesn't do that much damage from what I recall and shadow ward helps.
---
If you read the WoW Diary, you’ll understand that a lot of the talent trees each class has, were designed *very* late in the dev cycle.
---
The hunter skill tree, for example, wasn’t even in the Beta. It was completed in the last build before release. 
---
So, TLDR, blizz didnt carefully plan out classes, or the true balance between their abilities at different gear and character levels. Any balance that exists is essentially a holdover from the “pre-talent” class design work, that somehow magicallly held up despite the inclusion of talent and talent trees. 
---
In addition, it seems like their early design was based around classes gaining standard stats (e.g. int, spirit, strength, etc) and not “green stats” like spell damage, crit, etc. So a lot of weird balance issues come up with the existence of that gear. Since no one really designed around those stats eventually exisiting. 
---
So, from the standpoint of someone that’s studied Classic dev for quite some time, that statement is accurate as it is factually sound. Blizz folks themselves all generally agree that Classic was under developed when it came to class balance.
---
As a tank main myself I don't understand why tanks and healers constantly have to act like they are the dogs bollocks. Every role and class in WoW is piss easy to play.
---
Some tanks suck, some DPS suck and some healers suck. From my experience the three roles have the same portion of idiots. It's just that you need more DPS players so their total number is higher, but you can at least carry a shit DPS. If the tank or healer is clueless then it's hopeless.
---
Death knight spree is my fav. I have all his good ones on a playlist for my classic marathon
---
BRING BACK SWIRLY BALL!!
---
scnr - kinda fitted the theme you started.
---
Thanks for the reply! No i haven’t tried any of that yet, but I will do😊
---
Fanboys with pink glasses.
---
If you wanna succeed as a druid you better have a tons of friends or a guild master/officer buddy who will give you raid spot.
---
I love playing a Shaman, but if you're just looking for negative things, here are some of my opinions:  
---
\-Shamans are expected to heal in PvE, it will be difficult to find a raid spot as Ele/Enh.  
---
\-There are a lot of totems to manage, most of which are situational and it can be overwhelming to some people.
---
\-Enhancement Shamans are basically just hoping for the Windfury proc to deal burst damage. It's not very steady, but it's awesome when it happens.
---
\-No cc ability (like Poly, Fear, or Sap), but can have mediocre kiting ability with Frost Shock and Earthbind.
---
There are lots of pros to playing a Shaman, and still one of my favorite classes in vanilla.
---
It's a game though, so theres always fun ways to break the rule. Say a ?? is trying to guard and escort random low levels, you could try to get kills off behind their back. You may be ruining one persons day, but you're giving that ?? purpose in being a defender of the weak.
---
Ok listen, if you find it fine, then don't say anything then. Arguing that's x is harder, y is sub100% efficient won't help to convince people they actually can play whatever they want. In the end your kind of comment is just another contribution to more and more people playing warrior/rogue/mage, and, even if you are not one yourself, is also another contribution to bringing asshole behavior into the game. Don't take it bad, just be conscious that what you say may have not desirable consequences, and therefore don't feel necessary to say it.
---
ok?
---
By your logic I’d love WoD since Grom is in it and I’d love TBC because Illidan, Vasj, Kael.
---
Compared to every other villain till legion, Arthas was the best. 
---
Vanilla: A bunch of nobodies that become well known thanks to vanilla. 
---
TBC: over arching plot that butchered Illidan, Vasj, and Kael to ham fist them to villain status.
---
Wrath: Over arching plot where the villains presence is seen and felt constantly. One of the best villains in WoW. Also I disagree that him showing up reduced how much of a threat he is. Previously none of the bosses felt like threats because it felt like generic DnD dungeon crawl for the most part. Quick little things involving the bosses then raid them. Meanwhile Arthas shows up in leveling non stop and we see him with op powers where we have to escape him in a dungeon. 
---
Cata: does anyone give a shit about the blandness known as Deathwing? Fucking Cthun is more interesting.
---
MoP: Garrosh was fun to fight but he was built up as an asshole, not a villain till SoO. Hell they fucked up by making all horde major characters jump ship or try assassination or mokgara immediately instead of helping him then letting him make his choices still.
---
WoD:
---
WE WILL NEVER BE SLAVES, BUT WE WILL BE CONQUERORS! -Grom
---
DRAENOR IS FREE! -Grom
---
Legion: Fucking finnaly we deal with the legion. And the invasions were a perfect way to build up their threat. A more constant version of the wrath infection. Getting to Argus and fighting World Souls older and stronger than Azeroth was awesome. Dealing with spy’s and the broken shore failure that cost us major characters lives, was perfect for legion.
---
BFA: 
---
Still salty the only fucking character that’s interesting and had a character arc and personality gets killed off after we finally meet him and resurrect him after an assassination attempt. 
---
Are you supafly the warlock in IE?
---
These guilds are all running at near peak performance though, if you buff the bosses anymore I just don't know how the non hardcore guilds will ever have a chance of getting through. 
---
"Where the fuck are you even?" should definitely be much larger based on recent experiences &gt;.&gt;
---
Dungeons and Dragons have led me to the line of thinking that hit points aren't the number of times you can be hit, but a combination of stamina, luck, and skill that help you avoid being hit by a potentially deadly attack. The first half of your hit points are completely avoiding the attack, but doing so in a way that is draining. Your footwork is off, you roll with the blow, or the opponent simply falters with their strike and it doesn't land.
---
From there, you're bloodied. You aren't moving so fast, you're being worn out, you're getting tired, your opponent is getting better at reading you. Blows you were shrugging off and rolling with are getting more serious, you're starting to bruise, and your opponent is drawing blood.
---
Your last few hit points are your life. You take a potentially mortal wound and drop.
---
Why does good fix this? Because sitting down and eating calms you down. Your nerves are settled and the adrenaline fades. You take a moment to catch your breath and relax. This is why stuffing food in your mouth doesn't heal you when you go down, it's not fixing anything, it's just you catching your second wind before getting up and going at it again.
---
As you level up, you gain more and more hit points because you are getting better at fighting. You're more likely to parry or dodge, you're better at rolling through the punches, your confidence and stance is more offputting, making your opponent more warry of you and fight more defensively.
---
That in particular is a battle where all your warriors are tanking - indeed the only such battle.  
---
Look, we are operating on data from private servers because that's the only thing we have other than "I used to be top 5".  
---
I also played hunter, and remember doing fairly well, but I acknowledge that we pulled at least 15 dead bodies through our raids.    
---
According to LegacyPlayers, the top cat druid is around 540 dps over the last few raids, the top hunter is 560 and the top warrior 1058.  
---
A lot of the gearing for warriors wasn't well known until later. Our dps warriors never used +hit leather at the time.
---
mate have another look at the screenshots.  We wiped IE at Kazakk and it is TR in the Lucifron kill not IE.
---
Wrath, D I E and Serenity Now were all KoS.
---
I'm playing ud mage. Been playing the same class since launch.
---
If there is no sharding and/or dynamic respawn i'll just wait it out, take what i can, group up for kill quests for higher chance of tagging. Nothing else to do if you want to play, right? I'm not going to wait a month or two - don't think I can :)
---
Oh you misunderstand if you thought that I was calling yourself an elitist. I said that this "elitist mindset" (what you referred to as "impeding player stigma") is what's not required. Therefore essentially I'm agreeing with your statement just iterating on it ;)
---
&gt; worth logging in a videogame and not setting a foot outside.
---
You don't even know that. You know NOTHING of what went down.
---
Now you're slandering the grieving players by accusing them of not caring for their friend who died (despite the fact you don't know anything of course).
---
Not knowing shit yet keeping a big mouth.... great showing here, dude. 
---
I was hoping for pirate.. but got ninja. My expectations were nun-chucked right out the window. It was AAAARRRRgravating! 
---
With the knowledge we have today, no content in classic requires a "semi-hc" guild. All you need is 40 people with decent gear. The elemental-bosses surely require DEDICATION (read: farming) but that's all it takes.
---
I've played retail vanilla. I've seen ALL the content. I KNOW how hard it was. Nowadays with the details we know things are simply not as difficult anymore. Private Service progress shows this VERY CLEARLY.
---
My first comment is literally a joke because he said he was worried about not seeing his gear. I think you're taking this a little too serious man lmao chillax it's not a big deal.
---
Ah my mistake then, yeah it's unfortunate that people have this mindset but I understand.
---
Garbage tier humans.
---
t2 and other ele mail stuff, malistars and hand of edward
---
Blink?
---
Only "bads" used no addons back in the day... most of us used things like titan panel, CT_addon, etc. 
---
I'm rolling a druid so they won't even get a ress!
---
Wrong. The mug is dumped in the food.
---
Enchanting. Idk my 2nd profession for my pala yet.
---
A decent healer will just pop a hot on. A decent Warlock won't wait until oom then tap until they are on 5% health! 
---
How about binding frostbolt to left mouse click? :D
---
Mana inefficiencies and squishesness
---
Everyone in Vanilla is squishy, bar well geared tanks and Holy Paladins. So its somewhat a moot point to say Shamans are squishy, but even as Resto, you have limited means to protect yourself. You need a coordinated group to keep you safe, similar to Priests and Druids. If you solo queue as a Resto Shaman in BGs, you are probably going to get very frustrated as your teammates are in the corners of the map looking for kills.
---
You dont have Illumination like Paladins, meaning you do not practically have unlimited mana like they do.
---
Resto Shamans however do have a more interesting array of spells to use than Holy Paladins, and you are guaranteed a spot in a raid as every group needs 1 Shaman. Totems require spacial awarness and are far more interesting to use than just Blessings, and Chain Heal will always be more fun to use than Flash Heal.
---
&gt; 2019 addons are *weaker* than 2005 addons 
---
Really? Classic will have:
---
* Perfectly Accurate Threat Meters
---
* Heal prediction
---
* Accurate Enemy Castbars
---
* Debuff timers / Crowd Control timers
---
* Accurate boss timers
---
Plus a metric shitload of other crutches for people who like to convince themselves that they're playing vanilla, when they're actually playing Cata+.
---
Modern addons on the Legion client is absolutely not representative of vanilla gameplay. The only people who think it is are private server players who base all their knowledge on Mangos and don't have a clue what it was like to play at release when addons flatout didn't exist in any real fashion.
---
I find it hilarious how mad people like you get at the very idea that their precious addons not exist to carry them through every aspect of the game.
---
You can play as just another nightelf or you can play as THE dwarf.
---
Cool name tho 
---
Absolutely agree with you. Thanks bunches for the contribution!
---
You forgot druid. Hots up, root, bearform, gg. 
---
I love how he flooded his toolbar!
---
I just ask Alexa
---
1.12 still doesn't have DR on roots, does it?
---
So many spells that aren't frost shock. 
---
I meant BC has its own problems with class balance, like every raid bringing 5 shaman for totems/bloodlust and shadow priests giving their party ridiculous mana regen while mages (especially arcane), balance druids and elemental shaman are relatively weak. Arenas at a high level can arguably be pretty stale since druids, warriors and rogues are so dominant there. BC still has more overall balanced specs but it has problems just like vanilla
---
Warriors are skewed because patchwerk which is designed for maximum melle dps. Every fight with movement which is 95% of raid bosses, hunters excel. 
---
Whatever Blizzard wants to tell you loot trading and right click report are not for the players.  They are to minimize staff on a self running money generator.  It could be proven that both systems are more harmful than good to the players.  That will only matter to Blizzard if it can be proven that X amount of dollars will be lost vs Y amount of dollars lost by hiring a larger Classic GM staff.  
---
Classic is a money scheme plain and simple.  All remasters/remakes/reimaginings are a money scheme with zero risk.
---
Tanks have to be the alpha, tbh. You have to take control and keep it. Nobody else pulls unless the tank is OK with it/asks.
---
Who gives a shit what other people enjoy playing as? Everyone has their own reasons for preferring to play specific genders, races, etc. 
---
My biggest problem with playing a shaman was keybinding all the spells/totems. I've played warrior/rogue/druid/hunter all at level 60 and never had an issue with this but with shamans I swear you don't even have enough space on all 4 action bars for every shock/heal/spell and different ranks of heals.
---
They are also the least mana efficient healer so they burn through more consumes than say a paladin healer would. 
---
Having to drop new set of totems every time you move more than 20 yards.
---
Oh and also elemental doesn't suck it absolutely melts faces in pvp if you have the right gear. It's enhancement that sucks, doesn't matter if you have hand of rag you will get kited to hell and blown up like the piece of paper that you are. 
---
It is possible, yet also pointless. Since vanilla includes some grind, you can't be sure whether one grinding is a player or a bot, so you'd have to ask for reply or decide based on time. If you got a bot running, it's extremely easy to make it react to whispers.
---
There is about a 99% chance there will be goldsellers, AI or not.
---
Botting, however, can be prevented by detecting said software on client's computer which is definitely more reliable than checking patterns for every player online and approximating their movement - it would put extra strain on the servers.
---
Ah, you're Hawthorne.  I didn't get involved into forum drama until after you had your run but I was an original on the server.
---
I was in Awesome Possum then P4L when they were mass recruiting, then created my own guild which merged with Spite.  Then got picked up be IE.
---
I had a few good drama moments.  There was some Christian guild with "crusade" in their name and I was enemy #1.  They'd harass me and send e-mails to all the officers in IE about me fisting them.  I had a "come to Jesus" moment and joined their guild for a few weeks.  Got promoted to officer and kicked a whole bunch of people before they were able to remove me.
---
I also took off my gear to duel people in IF and used cheesy strategies to win.
---
As I type this, I do remember one interaction I had with you.  I was level 50ish and had no gear but spam pinged you for a duel.  You eventually took it and I won since I was frost.  You rage quit and another mage in your guild messaged me about the meltdown you had.  The name began with a D and I think he was an officer.  Deadly?  Destrukto?  
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Well, you can pretty much just solo the instance, if that can be called "tanking".
---
Yeah, things like that.  I don't think pranks were high on their "to fix" list, but things like this were.
---
Especially because PvP kills don't do durability damage, but if they let the mobs kill you, you take the damage.
---
I love shamans, the only "problem" I can think of besides the obvious lack of good PvE dps trees, is seeing pally heal gear drop and not be able to use it. Pallys get to use shammy gear 😔 
---
I'm a simple dwarf I like stones and I like guns.
---
I didn't know that. Sounds like a good book!
---
And when you're power shifting as a feral, you'll see your gear as well for fractions of seconds during fights :)
---
Back in vanilla wow going to do the alterac valley quests was easily a free level, the quests you got from the Alterac Mountain tunnel. It's still worth doing.
---
For warrior, I'd go Arms 31/20/0 for leveling, dungeon tanking and early raiding. Maybe 2h Fury since DW fury doesn't work until you get adequate +hit (10-15%). But there is 0 reason to go prot for tanking/leveling unless you're a main tank for a raiding guild and are frequently grouping with others since your dps output solo will be abysmal. 
---
The fuck are you talking about druids only spam healing touch? 
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx
---
No, I'm not Hawthorne
---
Wow! Thank for writing this :) beautiful
---
You have Hurricane lol :)
---
I'm a dude and play female characters in RPGs at least half of the time. They're more uncommon, are designed better (sans tauren/dwarves */shudder*) and that just makes them more interesting as a toon i invest time in. 
---
Never understood why people feel they have to play what they are in life. That being said, I'll be maining a human in Classic, 'cuz fuck dwarves.
---
The zeppelins only connect Org to Undercity and Org/UC to Stranglethorn. There is no zeppelin to Thunderbluff in Vanilla. 
---
My biggest... I’m out of mana because this tank is squishier than me, he might as well be fighting naked. No way am I gonna to devote my precious mana resource to healing you dps. Learn 2 play. 
---
A note to the Moderators: the sidebar link "Classy Friday (Class Discussions)" is broken and leads to "LFG Monday" instead
---
Not even what I asked for lol. 
---
I asked for proof for this claim:
---
That's a very specific claim and I see nothing of loot trading or ninja looting in any of your links. 
---
You're drawing bold conclusions from only slightly related stuff, yet prove nothing regarding ninja looting. 
---
Slowly, by gearing up by killing the previous bosses in the raid and getting a few hc players in. But yeah, it can be an issue as well.
---
But I also doubt those guilds were really at peak performance. I'm sure the players played a lot but doubt all 40 man in a raid were pros.
---
Shamans are more of a jack-of-all-trades than the "top" anything, even healing. You have to be okay with being a utility/support class for the most part. And your utility can be situational, not like polymorph or bubble or defensive dispel or other universally powerful abilties. 
---
For PvP they can be good in 1v1s against some classes, and can have some amazing burst when the stars align, but they really struggle when focused, regardless of spec. 
---
This is the video that made me buy the game.
---
-Enhancement requires WotLK to be good in PvP
---
-Elemental is a great PvP spec but requires good gear from raiding, most of those you won’t get for your offspec until your guild has the instance on farm
---
-If you want to PvP or farm you have to respec as the default 0/5/46 Resto spec is abysmal for both and respec costs add up quickly. Your best bet is either learning to play the AH, farming for a week or two to get yourself covered for a long time or roll an alt for farming
---
-Loads of keybinds.
---
-Pretty bad leveling. Enhancement is very random and may require two gear sets if you also want to do dungeons as a healer, Ele is more stable but you have to drink a lot between pulls
---
-See all those awesome looking tier sets? You won’t be wearing most of them for raids/dungeons so better get used to pretty teal/pink dresses. 
---
And ends with..?
---
1. At max level they're great, depending on the current raid tier. When it's just molten core, hunters are still pretty much on top. As each successive raid is released, other classes obtain powerful gear that makes them scale better than hunters do. They still remain powerful, but they're no longer "top of the food chain" as you put it.  
---
2. As I said in my previous answer, they don't scale nearly as well as other classes do in AQ/Naxx gear. They'll still be strong, of course, but warriors, rogues &amp; paladins will see more scaling from their raid-tier weapons than you will from your raid-tier ranged weapons. The stamina gains from higher-end gear also contributes to your burst feeling less... bursty, as does the insane bonus healing that opposing healers will have to counter your burst.  
---
3. Technically anyTHING is beatable. But not anyONE. That means, with enough skill, certain classes are just going to shut you down. A well played shaman will just dance around in your deadzone with frost shock until you die, healing themselves through your pet damage quite easily. The same applies to mages with cone of cold, fire blast and frost nova, if they get close enough. Rogues, when properly played, can kill you in a stun-lock so don't expect that to change with gear. Warriors can be countered a bit better by engineering and consumables in a 1v1. Keep in mind, almost every serious PvP player will likely have the same engineering devices and consumables that you do.
---
Yep...tried that for my alt in late Vanilla, had to give up and go arms. Fury was incredibly painful to play pre-60.
---
Rather want a playable game than "preserve it for history" bullcrap.
---
ty for the blog  
---
Mass Dispel :)
---
I'm about 51% confident this will happen. It'll be old god madness themed, to give a lore explanation for the free-for-all and an encroaching storm. Possibly set on an island. If done right it would suit the current events of the game pretty well actually. 
---
Oh sure as shit. And, now that you mention it, the mini quest log under the minimap wasn't even in vanilla was it?
---
You almost inevitably end up there either way at some point for a few different quests. That said along the way you can grab Ratchet, Crossroads and several other flightpaths and you'll hit level 2 from the exploration exp. The time you spend running there is saved in not having to grab these flightpaths later and questing in Mulgore 1-10 is quite a bit better than Durotar.
---
Right because preserving the original game in all its glory makes it suddenly unplayable even though Vanilla private servers have been going strong for a decade now. 
---
Great logic.
---
Everything nyhm did are classics. Such great stuff he made.
---
Look up the original official wow strategy guide for the recommended times. I’m a casual and play about 3 hours at a time also, and that is plenty of time to complete dungeons with a well balanced and experienced group. 
---
On a congested launch day Mulgore is objectively the most efficient leveling zone based on pretty much every past vanilla release we've seen.
---
That actually sounds awesome only of its vanilla cuz retail has no mana mechanics and mana health would be super important 
---
...a whimper.
---
Good post. I want post naxx content personally but I am not very excited for classic. They will fuck up anyway. I literally can hear Ian shittalk about accessibility and stability (sharding) already. Will give it a month, but I am pretty sure I will appear on my old vanilla server again soon. 
---
Armor and weapons that have stats which "give" you hp could be along the same lines.  A weapon is lighter, easier to handle, better balanced and less cumbersome.  Armor is lighter and more flexible, yet maintains it's toughness and protection.  Both allow you to move easier and, due to lighter weight, last longer.  
---
Jewelry could give you confidence in your actions, or cause your opponent to be either distracted or lose theirs.  "Holy shit, this guy must be tough!  Look at the jewelry he's able to afford from his adventures!  I might be screwed here..."
---
It's an easier run in Vanilla than it is since the cataclysm messed up the barrens and walled off Mulgore. 
---
I can't play it on alliance, where my guild is intent on playing.
---
Enhancement - it's not serious, it's not reliable. It has it's big moments time to time, but mainly it is not reliable and completely redundant in raids (even go away with your Nightfall).
---
Elemental - gets good with AQ raiding set before that it is not that super fun, it's actually fun till you have better or equal gear with other people :) The BEST thing of elemental is chain lightning, it's visually satisfying to use it, and use it in right places (like downing the last 3 mobs, and all of them die in the same time) and it's fun to shoot it at players, and see it do a huge crit or crit multiple people.
---
Resto - Super reliable... this is why it is the favorite build for shaman players. It's a good strong talent tree.
---
Personally I am a fan of elemental, wish it was more mana efficient for raiding. Also my favorite flask is Distilled Wisdom (+2000 mana) on ele/resto, and not the spelldmg flask.
---
Good post. I want post naxx content personally but I am not very excited for classic. They will fuck up anyway. I literally can hear Ian shittalk about accessibility (ez mode) and stability (sharding) already.

If you like Owl City, you should check out what he entirely ripped off of, [the Postal Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_Up), that album is really really great.
---
**Give Up**
---
Give Up is the only studio album by American indie band The Postal Service, released on February 19, 2003 through Sub Pop Records.
---
The band began as a side project between electronic music artist Jimmy Tamborello and Death Cab for Cutie's vocalist Ben Gibbard. The two had previously worked together for a track on Dntel's album Life Is Full of Possibilities.
---
The Postal Service's sole full-length release, Give Up was the second Sub Pop Records release to receive platinum certification, their best-selling album since Nirvana's Bleach.

BOOM FROST SHOOOOOOCK!
---
Personally, I play male characters because it helps me identify more with my character. I have no problem with people playing the opposite gender tho.
---
Classic players: we want everything the same as in Vanilla.
---
Also Classic players: *install a dozen mods that alter the UI and even gameplay*.
---
Honestly, I really-really dislike that people jumped on a train of lowering graphics to give back "the feel".  
---
My first thought when they presented classicwow was "Oh fuck, why did you decide to go back to previous models and textures?" If you liked classic cause of graphics you don't even know what entertains you. I personally would prefer total overhaul of the graphics, but I don't give a shit either way cause honestly, graphics don't entertain me. I know what did in vanilla and tbc and I'm going back to that.  
---
The content release timeline should be raised from 4 to around 8 stages with longer time frames at each stage.  
---
On side note, Id like spreading content release too.  
---
I say this to my roommate whenever our Grubhub food arrives
---
Will we be able to kite any world bosses to capital cities in the launching version of vanilla?
---
And instead of the mowhawk bomb, he has a classic bomb. He throws in on retail WoW and suddenly players start returning to the game again.
---
BRD would like a word.
---
I usually play male characters in all kinds of RPGs.
---
Except for Orcs and Trolls in WoW, I don't like their hunch. Their females have straight backs. 
---
&gt; \-See all those awesome looking tier sets? You won’t be wearing most of them for raids/dungeons so better get used to pretty teal/pink dresses. 
---
Why is that? Bad stats? Tier set bonuses?
---
Literally none of what you mention were intentional design choices. 
---
They’re all the result of people working on systems or classes, in a vacuum. 
---
Engineering was not designed intentionally to be the best PvP spec. They just designed a bunch of cool stuff for it, and a lot of that stuff turned out to be crazy good in PvP. 
---
I’d agree if it was all intentional, that it would be genius. But a quick read of The WoW Diary and the accompanying AMAs will quickly dispel any notion that the imbalances between classes and professions were intentional, or intentionally designed as “hard choices.”
---
See, the generalization that playing a female character is because you think the character is hot, is what makes this Asmongold take less woke than it seems to be. Not looking at the full picture
---
Some of us like to play wrinkled up Grandma orc warriors named Matilda with grey hair and fucked up faces. I sure as shit don't think that's hot, I just think it's hilarious
---
I think gnomeregan is also 3h+
---
Zug Zug
---
Not everyone does that though. The point is it is up to the individual what QoL improvements they get and not forced on them.
---
Worst part is you get downvoted if you try to explain how it actually works in live, people WANT to think it'll kill the game
---
Have u played during late wotlk and cata? It was shit
---
We already have that and it's called BFA.
---
Some of the bigger ones might be pushing it, but are doable with a good group. BRD, gnomergan, and maraudon come to mind. 
---
It would help to play a class that can fill an in demand role like tank or healer, which will cut down enormously on how long it takes to find a group. 
---
except there are addons that give flat out gameplay advantage  
---
that is not a simple "QoL"  
---
For example, addons that calculate health, spell durations, castbar etc.  
---
self  
---
Where's OOM?
---
Yup. Quit shortly before Cata. 
---
Never experienced loot trading being abused. 
---
Some people just like the animations females have better. I’m on a bc server and I’m a female belf rogue solely because of how female belfs stand in stealth. It’s awesome. Like they are ninjas. I wish more races had that.
---
&gt; Slowly, by gearing up by killing the previous bosses in the raid and getting a few hc players in. But yeah, it can be an issue as well.
---
That's such a marginal increase that it is impossible to make it the difference between downing a boss and not downing a boss. And is this on top of using full consumes? Because a flask will give mages/locks 150 spell dmg, which is a higher dps increase than if they had all the available upgrades up to cthune. And I can guarantee you almost all the mages/locks in the guilds who cleared 9/9 first week were using that flask full time. 
---
&gt; I'm sure the players played a lot but doubt all 40 man in a raid were pros.
---
You shouldn't need to be professional video gamers to clear the 3rd raid installment in the game out of 4 total. The whole "10-20 guilds did it first week!" thing is deceiving because any one of those guilds on a retail server would likely be the most hardcore guild on their server. There is just an abnormally high amount of dedicated players on private servers because that is all that is left to do in a 15 year old game to optimize to have raids cleared first week. 
---
These guilds didn't just roll out of bed a week ago and decide they were going to do this. People have been prepping this since launch. And it's not even the end goal, the whole point of clearing AQ40 first week of launch is to get as many clears as possible in so you can gear up your raid in preparation for full clearing naxx when it's released. 
---
Paladin?
---
We prefer to think of it as $15 for Classic, and modern is included free :)
---
* In Vanilla, pets were the same level they were tamed as.  In TBC or Wrath I think it changed to be 5 levels below you.  In Cata or Mists, it was changed that they don't even level and just stay caught up with you.
---
* In Vanilla, the NPC had to give you XP, and it would give your pet XP based on your pets level.  So you couldn't kill gray mobs and get XP, and when your pet was really low level the XP penalty really hit.  So you need to farm level 51-52 mobs and grind it out. 
---
* For the above reason, while it might be easier to level with a leveling pet (i.e. a boar or a bird), it might be more pragmatic to level with a raiding pet or PvP pet (i.e. a wolf, a wind serpent, or a fast-hitting cat).
---
There will also be no limit to the amount of amazing players willing to teach you the game. If you’re NA east coast RPPvP, I’ll be happy to help.
---
PvP-wise, dueling is a great way to learn how your class fights other classes. People love dueling, too :)
---
Okay, you've convinced me.
---
I like your style. 
---
I plan on mostly leveling characters in Classic.  My first is going to be a hunter, not because "hurr durr easy level" but because of how much you have to do to maximize the use of your pets at 60, and how starting off with the hunter will give me more time to do that.
---
great video!
---
that is some truly horrific misspelling of Troll.
---
My man Popeye
---
Vanilla doesn't have all specs balanced for raiding by a long shot, which is why people harp on that. However, for everything else the overall balance is actually pretty good. Leveling - most classes have multiple options. 5-mans - everything works. PvP - almost every spec has a role, and the only major balance issues are geared Warriors, and Naxx gear in general.
---
KT, CThun, and four horsemen are my top 3
---
Vanilla's class design is only an issue if you make it one. People nowadays are obsessed with marking the modern class designs in which every spec needs to be "equal, fair and balanced" as "good". I don't think a game needs any of those qualities in order to be fun. Inequalities are fun too, just in a different way.
---
Missing:
---
* I only heal people **after** they move out of the fire
---
* Not my problem you got globalled
---
* You need to learn to let the tank pull
---
* *(To warrior or rogue)* I know you don't have mana, and when you pulled, I didn't either
---
* I would have gotten the cast off if I didn't have 3 mobs smacking me and pushing the heal back
---
Pretty sure it was. I remember having to right-click quests to make them appear/disappear on the mini-log. I have no idea when it was added though.
---
Well OP, you're gonna be disappointed
---
What is everyone's opinion on best race gender combo for shooting and melee animations? 
---
Pick Up 3 friends as Warlock, Go Go Gurubashi Arena. Invite Random People. (In TBC invite bloodelves) . Wait till they Accept invite, Summon they, If they accept the Summon kick hin Out of group and kill him.
---
LMFAO @ 1:20
---
ah, I get it, you're looking at their bodies! looking at the muscles moving under the skin, smooth yet rocklike... imagining all the sweat they must have worked up going around, gathering badger assholes... how it's glistening on their back, their arms, their manly mustaches...
---
well, each to his own, I guess. I personally like looking at pretty things, so I'll be playing a troll.
---
 I personally always liked trolls bow shooting and 2 handed animations. I like how silly they look; their limbs stick out like they're monkeys.
---
Yes to all. I’ll be slow anyways because I’ll be a rogue. I love night elves and I usually am one but I think I’m gonna go human for the real thing.
---
vodka world first GANG
---
420 Blazing fo lyfe 
---
Female dwarf rogues were usually either god tier players or just really abysmally clueless IME, and I think that's cool. 
---
As a follow-up question:  which dungeons are there that can be broken up into smaller pieces, vs. dungeons that pretty much require a full clear?
---
I know at one end of the spectrum you have Scarlet Monastery which is already pre-broken.  You also have Mara which can be done Purple, then Orange, then Princess.  Or it can be full cleared.
---
But then you have dungeons like Wailing Caverns, Gnomer, and Zul'Farrak, which can technically be done compartmentalized (and often require multiple trips to get everything), but which are generally done in one trip.
---
Then there's even more linear ones like Deadmines, RFC, and SFK that you pretty much do straight through every time.
---
OP, I think the word you're looking for is "dungeon".
---
sadly, the closest thing they have to a rotor is a specific male undead haircut, and you're gonna have to provide the noises yourself.
---
(also, that username is fucking awesome.)
---
&gt;mwf I've seen late vanilla 29 Tauren Feral Twinks with more HP than fresh 60 mages.
---
I can't wait for how the general Classsic population who has never played vanilla before. I feel like the sheer volume of new players will wash out the percetage of seasoned players from OG vanilla or private -- and make it really as if it was fresh 2004/5
---
Yeah that guild is annoying. Its a goes straight on my ignore list kind of way.
---
People who roll female characters in WoW because "*I'd rather look at girl butt all day*" are the same mogs who haven't discovered pornhub yet.
---
Get laid or show some self respect.
---
of course you can...I always run my undead to Orc start, then over the mountain and all the way to TB then hearth back to Razorhill and do Orc start quests.  Usually at level 2 or 3 by the time I get back to Orc starting area just from discovering all the stuff along the way...plus have all FP by then, Org, Ratchet, XR, Camp T, TB
---
Or any human populus where 99% of the women are ALL fit, thin large bust, etc.
---
Fem Tauren is goat what you talking bout
---
* 4 bag slots are "wasted" on totems.  Not a huge deal, and a better deal than hunters and warlocks get (maybe better than rogues, too), but still a cost to play the class.
---
* Players want Windfury, even if it makes the pull aggro and die.  You can't give them Totem of Less Threat (blanking on the name) because it is the same totem class as Windfury and they don't want to lose WF.
---
* Totem management can be a pain.  You can't pull totems like in later expansions, so you have to plan ahead where your totems are going to go.  It also takes 6 seconds worth of GCDs for you to be "combat ready" by dropping all of your totems down, and you have to keep track of them.
---
* Action bar space used for totems (less of an issue with a totem bar addon).
---
* The fact that for PvE, there's only one race worth picking (Troll) and that race in general has among the weakest racials of the faction.
---
I had a Mage friend who was the main disenchanter for the guild, and everytime he had to shard an item he could use with defense on it, he used to keep it and just give the guild a Nexus shard instead. He had quite a high defense rating in the end and could take a lot more of a beating than he was meant to. I mean, he couldn't main tank a raid, but I saw him accidentally end up off tanking some serious hits while the off tank regained aggro. 
---
Admittedly, the only game I play a female character is in KF2, and only because I like Rae's Aussie accent over the other character's voice lines.
---
But even then, I'm picking from a roster of characters, not creating my own virtual pixel waifu.
---
There were a couple types of cloth that were needed in excess and usually required farming, I think it was Wool and Mageweave maybe? Definitely required grinding, but felt rewarding. I plan to main a lock once again, and I'll tailor but I think I'm going Herbalism switching into Alchemy later. 
---
Addons was a core feature in vanilla dude.
---
Those are all why vanilla is good wtf. Engineering added so much depth and hard counters are still winnable. 1 shoting req a lot of set up. Trash comment. 
---
Wool was always a pain, farming Stockades for it was pretty decent for gold early on. Coincidentally where most of my mount money will be going lol.
---
If I see alliance Female Nelf or Female Human character in Armor Kini's, I automatically assume they are some neckbeard who deserves the gank and camp they're about to receive. 
---
To be fair, I also go out of my way to kill gnomes.  I can't imagine playing the game without having to drop everything and attack any number of gnomes in the area (even if I need to die trying).
---
Don't waste your time arguing with people who have anti-social personality disorders.
---
Anyone who doesn't understand why this was a shitty thing to do isn't capable of basic decency.
---
never tried bana bred might give it a try :)
---
every raids gotta have a mascot
---
It's great! I've made quite a few of the recipes in there. My favorite so far is the Beer Basted Boar Ribs. Last Thanksgiving I made the Slow Roasted Turkey and stuffing with the Mulgore Spiced Bread. The "Autumnal Herbs" seasoning recipe in there is really good. What's fun is they have an "IRL Cooking Skill Leveling Tree." I almost have 225 Cooking but the recipes are all pretty easy to follow even for a someone with Apprentice Baking skill ;).
---
&gt; The old spell batching system has to be preserved in Classic's PvP. IE,  how 2 mages were able to sheep each other at the same time. 
---
I played from US release. I cannot remember a single time this ever happened. Maybe it did and I just don't remember, but if it did, it was so rare as to be completely missing from my memory.
---
The people arguing for Spell-batching are the private server crowd, not vanilla vets.
---
Cons- when Shaman and Paladin became shared classes, dwarves did not have access to them until the game was beyond repair (Cataclysm). That's a crime in itself.
---
night elf male... perfect
---
I agree that it is not the healers job to police dungeons like this.  It is every single group member's job to police dungeons like this, IF they think it is appropriate.  Healer just has a very effective enforcement mechanism.
---
You do not think that is appropriate, which is great.  Totally fine opinion, not making a judgement either way.  
---
might be my favorite vanilla video
---
Private servers are fuck all like real vanilla.
---
Did you actually play vanilla, or are you basing all your knowledge of Mangos and amateur guesswork?
---
lol who is the butthurt Female Nelf Hunter neckbeard downvoting you all?
---
Its not even proper use.
---
I know you said let the tank get hit once or twice, but I thought you didn't stun hardly AT ALL on dungeon mobs so the tank can keep their rage up.  I guess it depends on the tank's preference, gear level and overall ability.
---
Heal prediction, enemy castbars, cc timers, etc, etc, etc.
---
Addons are a massive crutch, but all the so-called #Nochanges advocates don't understand that shit isn't vanilla, because none of them ever actually PLAYED vanilla WoW.
---
I'd love to have a chat with you 6 months from now, you're in for a treat. 
---
I, and many other players, are idiots. That being said I think the only significant changes due to theorycrafting over the past 15 years will be within the top 5% of players. Its still gonna be a shit show for the majority of people. 
---
Which combo (faction) is better for PVP?
---
If I go alliance (dwarf), I can counter devouring plague and blind + poisons, so mostly dwarf is a counter to rogues, hunters, a little to undead SP.
---
If I go horde (orc), I have huge 25% stun resist and all classes have some sort of a stun and resisting it can be top tier racial. But if I'm playing horde as a hunter I will see paladins everywhere with blessing of freedom in my face.
---
What should happen is the tank will range pull so by default all mobs go to him (never put a shield on the tank or hots, both are bad for different reasons).
---
Mage or hunter or whomever will CC (trap, poly etc.) reducing the pack size.  After the tank gets hits once or twice by the initial target to help build up rage, the primary kill should get slapped with a cheap shot while the second kill continues to hit the tank for more rage.  The rogue should then kidney shot to keep that target stunned. The primary kill target should die within that 8-10 second window while the tank builds up more rage for the second kill.
---
In this manner, even a 4 pack pull in a normal 5 man, the tank is only ever really receiving damage from 1 source at a time, and the healer will rightfully get bored by not having to dump mana keeping people alive.
---
Man I remember everybody be it in trade, general or raid instance chat was blowing up on my server and I have to imagine most others. Fucken everyone was watching this one and it was great
---
There is one way to make it work, as per kargoz (did some good guides o' YouTube). If you are with a warlock you go balance, moon fire insect swar and then melee for clearcasting procs to heal. Heard its fun. 
---
\&gt;5 mans

---
The druid version of Atiesh gives an 11 mp5 aura, not the 2% crit chance.
---
As a long time warlock I am very cognizant of when I have a HoT and when I don't.  If you HoT me I will effectively use that HoT as much as I can to get mana back and remain high health.  You don't have to tell me it is coming, I got it.
---
I can't stand warlocks that life tap until they are 100% full of mana.  I'll be honest it kind of triggers me a little bit.  Why lifetap to 30% health and 100% mana? It is stupid.  Warlocks should take advantage of their health AND mana regeneration.  You should never be 100% full health or 100% full mana unless you are both.  Try to aim for relatively equal health and mana at all times, although don't let your health drop so low that you worry about dying.
---
Ok, saved your comment. I will make threads here with my hunter dps to show all the private server kids what hunters can do in retail.
---
r/breddit do not understand the gravitas of this post... welcome home op 🤗
---
like kissing a booboo
---
druids have 0 issues tanking dungeons fite me
---
Saved as well. Worst case scenario, it will mean hunters are actually good at something in pve instead of just being a tranq shot bot. You should know though, they just don't scale. They're best range in MC but already behind warriors and rogues, and then they get progressively worse with each tier. 
---
The grenade wasn't in vanilla... 
---
Sick of these kind of posts on this sub tbh
---
modding can still exist lmao 😄
---
Warlocks, shadow priests, and frost mages are your biggest problems 1v1. I had less issues with shadow priests as a dwarf (stoneform for devouring plague, no dwarves so I could viper sting). Engineering definitely helps, though. I always had a shadow reflector on with a frost in my bag, because those were my hardest matchups.
---
Overall I found alliance hunter life better than horde. So many dwarves to stoneform viper sting, then you have pallies which are the biggest anti hunter in group pvp. 
---
What is true and what the culture of the time accepted are different things.
---
Wailing Caverns in a nutshell horde side when the tank insists he can at level 18.
---
Dude is wearing white leather and cloth, without even kresh's shield...
---
...For this reason WC I absolutely rather have a bear tank for sleep and the fact half decent leather gear means he's tanking better and doing more damage.
---
 True story: those had better picture quality than most displays, even to today. 
---
disagree, gouging a blink was a real thing in vanilla and was a big deal in rogue vs mage matchups
---
Took me 1 bwl with world buffs to get to top11 of all the rogues on a server in BWL average dps - On a half-green, half-blue geared feral.
---
Green Jesus fucking christ. You ramble about preserving Vanilla and you want people to experience a close replication of how the game was actually played during classic and then you act like private servers achieved that feat. 
---
You either didn't play classic back in the day or you are straight up stupid.
---
I dont think you know what balance means, no offense.
---
&gt; Did you actually play vanilla
---
He clearly didn't
---
Sick of comments saying theyre sick of these posts tbh.
---
We've been seeing meme posts for quite some time now. 
---
Release is soon. Posts like this should be going stronger than ever, especially with the lack of news. Sorry that I'm very passionate about this game and want it to succeed.
---
I would guess one of the biggest differences is how much quicker people level and reach 60. So many people have done the quests before so they know exactly where to go, which ones are worth it etc. 
---
Y’all wiping too much sometimes ya gotta take a poo! Lol
---
late vanilla I think... 
---
&gt; For those asking for post-Naxxramas content, you need to keep in mind this isn't OG Blizzard who created WC3 + Vanilla &amp; TBC. They're BOUND to water the game down somehow if you open that can of worms.
---
Sorry dude. Character transfers will allow future content without removing existing content. I really hope they go this route. 
---
I doubt they'll change any of the story, but I'm hoping they not only fix their feature-related mistakes in TBC &amp; Wrath, but fix any anecdotal story mistakes as well. 
---
&gt; it was fun to imagine what would come next. 
---
disappointment. 
---
 Warlock pairs nicely with a healer. He can go druid and put HOTs on you and you'll have infinite mana with life tap. Kitten DPS + infinite mana warlock = non stop murdering. 
---
 For me, Shadowpriest / Warlock is the dream duo.
---
 I wouldn't worry about starting zones. You can meet up easily enough. 
---
I bet it was their myspace name too
---
Yeah, I don't understand that. But that's just me. Atlas Loot &amp; DPS Meter at most for me.
---
Why don't you like Balldestroyer420 in warcraft??
---
as far as I know, only alliance can stay competitive with feral, without blessing of wis and might you will be oom quickly and might helps more since you don't benefit from WF
---
What a weak flawed argument. 
---
Rogues could blind each other at the same time if they both casted it off at the same time. Rogues could also vanish a death coil. Double sheep did happen.
---
It's either you didn't PvP or you're a "I played Vanilla" troll spewing nonsense, and I'm thinking it's more of the latter.
---
Whats a Plagu bear
---
Its not like only certain people have access to the better gear, its a level playing field. 
---
I feel like its just PvE hero's that want their game temporarily harder want progressive itemization. And lets be honest, without that extra Spell Power on gear, Attack based classes absolutely dominate PvP because cloth just can't output enough damage to compete with even hunter pets or warrior/rogues smashing them in the face.
---
MC will be trivialized because of sheer player knowledge and such. Itemization is a minor factor -- but since DM is available out of the gates, its moot imo. The BiS lists that have DM gear listed are going to be there one way or another.  If Fury Warrior and Rogues do 10% more damage due to better itemization, its really not going to change anything in PvE. MC will be run over, and BWL is going to test people on how much of a shitter they are or not. Its not the gear for the most part. A good player will perform well in PvE regardless if they have the extra stats provided by late game itemization.
---
Your loaf's got no nuts, and that's a major fail.
---
Most retail kiddies would ragequit after level 40 in vanilla. 
---
ga on reaching level -31
---
What about those meme posts? 
---
Soon yeah. Could be June, July or if we are unlucky even August.
---
Why should these post be going stronger than ever?
---
Yeah you are passionate about the game and you want it to succeed like literally every single other person on this sub mate. Get a hold of yourself and don't act like you and your passion are special.
---
For grinding my last few levels, I just fought blizz devs until I had enough xp to ding. 
---
I'll take my years of vanilla experience vs your 0 minutes of experience.
---
Show me a single video recorded in actual vanilla that shows two people simultaneously CCing each other. 
---
I'll wait.
---
I think some specs can, and they all have some kind of absorb. Plus pvp talents used to have some healing options but i'm not positive anymore as I've been unsubbed for a bit.
---
I'll be done with Blizzard if they can't do this right. They may as well move their headquarters to China
---
2-3 will come back but I think I have 2-3 new players and it'll be great to play with them.
---
Nelf have shadowmeld, and you can get through an entire aimed shot cast while stealthed. Stealth only breaks when the shot is actually fired. 
---
I don't know if that's enough to beat stoneform and gun  bonus. At least, you'll get more cred playing dwarf than legolas clones.  
---
As hunter you have one of the best tools for beating paladins in viper sting. Trolls are also pretty good for PVE with bow bonus and berserking, though with the exception of rhok'delar bows are pretty bad. 
---
Yo fellow classic community friends
---
I always mained mage because of its insane potential to do extreme solo runs and achievements
---
My question is - are hunters good content soloers? I mainly love to solo grind some rare dungeon or raid trash loot
---
Toshiba master race lmao
---
Typical uninformed troll post. Go push sand.
---
1 prayer = 1 BFA dev gets fired
---
I was in a guild that completed all content, I know how hunters do in raids. Hunters raid dps is amazing in mc/bwl and drops down a bit in aq due to bwl melle upgrades. But by mid/late naxx I was doing great damage again in non-aoe fights. 
---
I was also fairly noob at the game back then and didn’t understand min maxing as much as now.  Damage meters back then also did not add pet damage to hunter but as a separate player, if that is fixed for classic I feel confident I can get crazy numbers.
---
Thanks, I was also thinking warlock druid would be a good team, I'd even run to the Tauren starting area if I had to
---
Ol' Bobby over there
---
The average idiot will still be as such.
---
For people who know what they are doing, they will have planned routes, make money faster and item progress faster.  That's about it.  In general PvE Hero's who only care about doing raid content will push through content very *very* quickly compared to vanilla.  But the average player will still just do whatever.
---
I tanked 5 man's pretty handily, but I was expected to heal in raids 
---
"Pound sand"
---
I'll address your post from the position of TBC and Live.  I'll start with live.
---
**Live Design vs. Vanilla**
---
Class balance, starting in WotLK but definitely evident by Cata and Mists, has moved from the game being an RPG to the game being an Action Game/eSport.  You see this in both PvE and PvP.
---
* In PvE, it's important for raids to be designed around everyone competing on some sort of meter, whether it's damage or healing.  Your effectiveness is not in how well you support the group, but in how much damage or healing you do (while also not screwing up).  The big push for enrage timers to matter, as well as for there to be a more-and-more comprehensive checklist for what each role needs has pushed this homogenization.
---
* In PvP, arena balance (and later RBG balance) have pushed the e-sports goals.  This has also been attributed to homogenization.
---
Where in Vanilla, each class had its own unique identity and role in a group or guild, in live your role is more important (ranged, melee, tank, healer).  If I were to compare it to an FPS game, Vanilla was a game like Doom or Half-Life, where each weapon (or class) was completely unique.  Modern WoW is like Counter-strike, where you have the shotguns (tanks), the sub-machine guns (melee), the rifles (ranged), and the pistols (healers).  While there's a difference between the MP7 and the P90, it's really not that much.
---
**TBC vs. Vanilla**
---
TBC did change a lot about the game, in my opinion for the better.  Some people say it was worse.  I say that the things which eventually became worse, weren't too far done in TBC.  (For example, flying didn't become an issue until Cataclysm, in my opinion).
---
However, specifically looking at class changes, my opinion is that TBC is like the final version of the Vanilla class design.  Almost as if Vanilla classes were a beta for the TBC classes.  However, this is the only expansion in which the class design still felt like Vanilla, where each class and spec has its own unique playstyle and feel, with both pros and cons to the class.
---
You still had class quests, still had spell ranks, still had specs which were only good for one thing...but overall the balance was better.  I'd argue that they actually made some of the classes stand out better in TBC than in Vanilla, for example making Resto Druids really fill the niche of the HoT-based healer, or allowing all 3 tank classes to come into their own.
---
So what did TBC largely do?
---
* Give hybrids mana in their DPS specs.  Elemental Shamans and Balance Druids got MP/5 based on Intellect.  Ret Paladins got mana back on Judgement, or when taking heals (Seal of Blood OP).  Protection Paladins got mana back when healed so they could sustain through a fight.  Enhancement shamans got the Shamanistic Rage cooldown.  Hunters got Aspect of the Viper.  And finally, shadow priests got Vampiric Embrace (or Touch, I can never remember which is healing and which is mana).  All of these led to the problem of classes going OOM too quick to not being an issue.
---
* Scaling was much improved.  Lots of classes got talents like "your X spell gets Y% more damage from your spell power."  Hunter pets scaled with their stats.  This fixed several other issues.
---
* Tank and healer balance.  Instead of druids (only for leveling) and warriors, you now had 3 classes each with niches and specialties.  Druids were the best off-tanks.  Warriors were the best main tanks.  Paladins the best trash tanks.  With few exceptions, any of them could fill any role, just the others did it better.  Where in Vanilla design you might only want warriors for your raid team, in TBC our preferred tank duo for Zul'Aman was Druid + Paladin.  Healers, same thing - healers now had niches to fill, and it made them stand out.
---
* Hunters got a lot of benefit in making traps available in combat.  (I believe a lot of Rogue stealth abilities were improved as well).

* Introduction of the combat rating system and jewelcrafting.  This may not seem like as big a deal for class balance, but it did affect gear balance.  In Vanilla, you've probably noticed that when you get hit, crit, or another secondary stat, it comes in a static value (for example, 1% crit).  This leads to some pieces of gear being insanely good for their level, because that 1% crit has more value at level 60 than at level 20 (when you can first equip those gloves).  Jewelcrafting gives a lot more flexibility to make a piece of gear fit your spec, which does help balance.
---
* You don't need to raid to get good PvP gear.  You don't need to PvP to get good raid gear.  But maybe doing a little bit of both will help you out.  (I also like how honor worked for low-level players in TBC a LOT better than Vanilla).
---
* Some minor QOL changes, such as Hunter Tracking being able to differentiate between friend and foe, rearrangement of low-level talents to make the builds make a little more sense, removal of the need to get tomes to learn the highest rank of your ability, 
---
Overall, TBC seemed to look at classes and specs and find huge holes in their gameplay that needed to be filled, and plugged in abilities to fill those holes.  Future expansions tried to do this as well, with diminishing returns on success, since the low-hanging fruit was ironed out in TBC. 
---
The two best changes that came out after TBC for class balance were:
---
* Giving druids a real resurrection spell
---
* Removing "can only be used outdoors" from a lot of other spells
---
However, WotLK started the trend of making everyone viable at a role.  Frost should do similar damage to fire, even if Frost is way better at kiting and taking hits, because that can't mess up PvP, right?  All tanks should be easily able to AoE tank everything, and all DPS should have AoE DPS abilities, because that can't make trash pulls trivial, right?  Everyone needs humanoid CC because that can't make PvP boring, right?  Removing reagent costs means less chores, but at some cost to the RP of the game.
---
**Anyway...**
---
I hope this helps answer your question.
---
&gt;In Vanilla, the NPC had to give you XP, and it would give your pet XP based on your pets level. So you couldn't kill gray mobs and get XP, and when your pet was really low level the XP penalty really hit. So you need to farm level 51-52 mobs and grind it out.
---
you can grind low level mobs to level your pet. It just has to not be grey for your pets level. I remember lvling Lupos in stonetalon mountains for example
---
The Three best class "duos" that stand out are 
---
Shaman/Paladin + Warrior (offense v defense)
---
Shadow Preist + Warlock
---
Druid + rogue stealth team
---
pick your poison. My group will be using a lot of Shamans + Warrior combos.
---
I don't even really know the exact number because everyone is pulling someone else that I'm not fully acquinted with in as well. I know at least 5 but I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being like 15 in the end.
---
&gt; Trash comment.
---
He's just answering the dude's question, not advocating for anything. Calm down.
---
&gt; So, TLDR, outside of the initial design period, blizz didnt carefully plan out classes, or the true balance between their abilities at different gear and character levels. Any balance that exists is essentially a holdover from the “pre-talent” class design work, that somehow magicallly held up despite the inclusion of talents and talent trees. 
---
Really just shows how immensely talented the initial devs were.  And proves how we'll never get a game nearly as balanced from Blizz. 
---
Why do you think female tauren and dwarves are designed worse? I think they look great.
---
In 2005 I played a holy priest and got exalted in all 3 battlegrounds. People back then weren’t used to that and I survived pretty easily.
---
Today I’m a level 44 holy priest on a private server and haven’t stepped into a BG cause I’m pretty sure I would get my ass handed to me 
---
right off the get go.  Those were fun times for sure!
---
Probably none tbh😞.  Feels bad man. 
---
SM breaking on firing was fixed somewhere around 1.6 patch, so on classic SM should be breaking on starting aimed cast.
---
Well, draining mana with viper is one things, trying to run from a warrior/rogue with BoF is another one :) I know theory, but would like to hear from someone experienced with hunter PVP.
---
Archaedas
---
In Live or Private Server?
---
In the Private Server I'm on, my pet gets XP for gray mobs, but I don't remember that being the case in Live.
---
What a load of shit. Fuck off
---
You really think that the #nochanges folks aren't mostly former vanilla wow players?  I assumed they mostly were.
---
Well, I am probably in the #nochanges camp although I will still play with minor changes and I DID play Vanilla WoW.
---
Thank you for your reply!  How do you win vs locks ( god forbid SL spec) ? I'm assuming there's more to it than just reflect coil and keep viper up...actually,how much of an impact does viper sting have vs locks ? I know it's devastating for shadow priests as they do pretty much go OOM super quick.
---
Will certainly be going Alliance,that's for sure :D
---
Just me. One passed away last year, the other doesn't play games anymore. They were my best high school buds and we used to lan every weekend at each other's houses and play cs and wow. 
---
I do have some other gaming buddies that will play though. It will be a new vanilla experience, but I'll always remember the times me and my best friends had lanning wow in high school. Great times indeed.
---
RIP Brizors
---
Theorycrafting will have a massive impact on every single player who is willing and able to search for guides (Class, Boss, PvP, everything)
---
Back in the day people were absolutely clueless. Just think about how many upset NE and Human priests there must have been when they realized how broken the dwarf racial alone was?
---
Be it MMOs, MOBAs, Shooters or whatever. Nowadays we have guides for literally every single aspect of a game, pretty much from day one since those guides get written in beta. Now this game will be almost 15 years old. The knowledge available today compared to back then is incredible.
---
Humans surely?
---
You continue to imply that Vanilla and Classic are radically different.  I agree it is only an approximation, but I don't know why you are so confident that they are radically different.  I played both Vanilla and several Private Servers and I can tell you they got it mostly right. 
---
Did you play Vanilla and Private Servers?  Where are you basing your claim that they are WAY different?
---
&gt;A well played shaman will just dance around in your deadzone with frost shock until you die, healing themselves through your pet damage quite easily. 
---
You have so many ways to get out of deadzone, a hunter definitely should win 1v1 vs a shammy as long as it's world PvP where there's some open space. You outrange all his spells and can scatter/trap him if he gets too close. If its a duel situation it's tougher because of less kiting range, but still winnable. 
---
&gt;Rogues, when properly played, can kill you in a stun-lock so don't expect that to change with gear. 
---
roll dwarf or orc and use pvp trinket and it's unlikely to happen, and unless the rogue is really tryhard with consumes/engi/hemo prep specced, he won't stand a chance. 
---
&gt;Warriors can be countered a bit better by engineering and consumables in a 1v1. 
---
You should not lose an 1v1 against a warrior as a hunter, ever. Unless he hella outgears you and has engi/consumes while you have nothing, (and even then you should win if its open world pvp) they are the easiest class to beat. 
---
I'll agree with mage though, they can actually abuze the deadzone, but even that matchup is pretty balanced if the hunter is good and uses his pvp trinket/other cds right. Again the hunter has a better chance in world pvp where he has room to kite than in a duel situation where space is limited. 
---
The only class you get complete hardcountered by as a hunter is warlock, in particular SL warlock 
---
Expect to see more people actually finishing MC/Ony/BWL. Also expect far more fury warriors and rogues around the place.
---
Ni Hao was frequently sang amongst my friends at LAN parties.  Really fun times.  :)
---
And don’t forget people will shy away from ret and moonkin. 
---
Female orcs &gt; male orcs due to animations and proportions
---
It's a rare thing these days.
---
"My opinion is more important and correct than your opinion."
---
No it hasn't been posted in nearly 3 days so I almost completely forgot. 
---
Thank you for taking the time to reply to all of the questions ! It seems like it's gonna be one hell of a struggle after Molten Core if I don't get the jump on someone,huh ?   Guess I'll just have to suck it up and deal with the scaling  / dead zone issues if I 100 % settle on hunter - your replies really,really put things into perspective for me :D
---
the problem with vanilla was the class descriptions, the led many of us to have very unreal expectations of what we would be doing endgame. I spent months leveling a druid with the expectation I would at LEAST be able to dps and occasionally OT in raids, but instead you had to spec into innervate (back when innervate was a talent) or you absolutely weren't getting into a reputable raiding guild. 
---
If the class description said oh by the way all your going do in raids is shitty heals and innervate priests I wouldn't have wasted 6 months of my life leveling a druid.
---
My favorite spell is also a whole spec.  Perfect balance
---
I mean like running distance while doing quests. Sorry, I didn’t clarify that. Quests are spread out. It is the plains after all, I guess. 
---
I'll believe it when I see it, until then I'm sure you'll understand why I doubt you.
---
Hunters can still drink infight with Feign Death.
---
Thank you for the reply ! Pretty damn good insight. So there's no way in hell to deal with locks at all as a hunter?
---
With those arguments, engineering was a necessity in classic as well.
---
There already is a fight to the death arena thing with a bunch of players
---
We can only hope XD that was one of my favorite things of classic haha .
---
&gt;  I played both Vanilla and several Private Servers and I can tell you they got it mostly right.
---
&gt; Did you play Vanilla and Private Servers? Where are you basing your claim that they are WAY different?
---
Is this an attempt at trolling? I honestly don't even know if I should invest the time to answer, but whatever
---
If you actually played Vanilla back in the day you would know how drastically different it was, because of patches...
---
Quests. The most simple thing. A shitton of quest got added during Vanilla. While on private servers they exist from day 1. There simply were far from enough quests in Vanilla from day 1. XP and rep rewards on private servers are also completely wrong.
---
Class changes? Balancing changes? Item changes? 
---
Yeah yeah, that's why I said "likely" and "to me." :P  I know how stupid it is to speculate endlessly, but I just felt like supporting this guy that threw in a random date and because I happened to agree.
---
Going by 'the' pserver, people will absolutely not shy away from ret for some reason. Moonkin definitely though.
---
Less rogues then before, More fury warriors, Mages and Warlocks.
---
You can just admit you dont like a balanced game. Its ok dude, no need to rage.
---
Mages have whatever that fire spell is that resets them to half hp when they nearly die. They also have THREE different shields, each of which count as healing.
---
&gt;  Four times on rfc? Feels bad man       
---
It is a long assed walk back too :).   I really wanted to get those five quest turn- ins, so I hung in till the end.      
---
BiS for shaman is most often cloth and leather unfortunately. You can always just wear what you want though.
---
Lady Vashj for sure
---
Hunter, warrior, priest seems like an idea trio as it's strong for pvp and you can easily make dungeon groups.
---
We can't be sure the Wolfshead Helm and Manual Crowd Pummeler will be viable options in Classic.  Take away one of those two items and the feral druid dps drops even further.
---
I thought Viper Sting was added in BC?
---
in very favourable terrain, you can technically kite him at 41 yards (his spells have 36 yard range) while viper stinging him, and very slowly taking him down that way. In reality it almost never works out because of small terrain/micro lag allowing him to catch up those 5 yards for just a few seconds so he can full dot you /deathcoil you, etc. If the warlock is SM/ruin you can hope to get some lucky crits and burst him down. Especially early on when people aren't that geared, you can be lucky and burst him down unless he is SL specced. Also carrying a shadow reflector can potentially turn the tides if you get a clutch use of it, like reflecting a fear or deathcoil. But as the warlock keeps getting more gear, more stamina and damage, and especially if he's pvp specced, it's been damn near impossible to win in my experience (2 years retail vanilla hunter, about 2 years private server hunter). 
---
The biggest problem with Druid/Warlock is movespeed. For about 20 levels the druid character will constantly be waiting up for the warlock or staying busy chasing nodes. Druid Shaman is pretty flavorful and at 20 you both get some movespeed increase. Also each have pretty annoyingly long quest chains, so you'll never feel too behind from another on those.
---
A lot of specs that used to be laughing stocks will prove actually useful now that people know how to use them. I'm expecting feral druid performance and demand to be the biggest shift, pun intended.
---
Hunters are one of the best content soloers. A hunter can distract trash mobs with his pet while he runs by quickly with aspect of cheetah and then feign death in a safe spot. Then he can do it again and often doesn't even need to ressurect pet since by targeting a distant enemy he can have it run far enough away that it despawns and can be instantly called back to his side.
---
Hunters are also usually the ideal class for killing a boss solo, combining high solo DPS with the tankiness of a pet and the healing of mend pet. Alternatively kiting can be used to kill a boss that can't be tanked outright.
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxNJZZENk7k) is a great demonstration of how powerful a hunter's toolkit is for bypassing trash and killing bosses. Also check out solo mara and DM tribute farming runs.
---
I thought ferals were still a joke but I haven’t really played private servers. What happened?
---
My all time favorite is probably Jamaz - Conviction but looking at it these days isn’t as impressive as it was back then so to speak :D
---
Also lots of good music in there imo
---
Aspect of the Viper was added in BC.  Viper Sting was in Vanilla.
---
Yeah. I can't stand a lot of the names people use on pservers. I'm actually looking forward to some oversight on player names, automated or otherwise. When Classic comes I ain't raiding with "Pussyqueef," "Fartsinurmouth," "Cvnt," or "Boogerfeast." I ain't listening to people say those names on Discord.
---
I outdpsed half the server aa lvl 55 boomking in aq40 in vanilla. I was just onlyone to figure it out. Sorry i have no screens, u just gotta believe me!
---
I've run smooth endgame dungeons with shaman tanks. Granted they were geared to the teeth and we all knew how to watch a threat meter.
---
I agree with that about TBC in its relation to Classic.  I'm convinced that much of Classic class design was only broken because they simply ran out of time and had to release *something* and hope it worked.  I figure they always planned to fix the classes as the game went on but then never had the resources to truly do so because they realized they had to keep creating new stuff for people to keep playing because they had made the decision to make max-level stuff the thing to do and not levelling the thing like most every MMORPG before them had done.
---
It wasn't until TBC that they finally had the time and resources, somehow, to fix most every class (meaning spec), and I think that's why TBC was supposedly the "best" expansion: It fixed the most because no era of WoW was as broken as Classic, in my opinion.
---
And also play the game in a drastically different way with the knowledge they have now i.e. speedrunning etc. Theyre already intentionally changing their experience but wanna get defensive about good change.
---
Ugh please god no
---
Run as many lowbies through dungeons for a week then start a WPvP guild where we terrorize the Alliance in their leveling process with the advantage of better gear from all the dungeons we leveled through. 
---
There are no feral druids in private server guilds that currently farm naxx.
---
Except the healer only has so many resources.  Countless times there have been wipes because threat was spread over multiple players and the healer need to waste mana doing inefficient, reactive heals, rather than staying on top of the tank's health in a predictable manner.   Every healer wants to see the groups stay up through a bad pull, but sometimes you need to triage.       
---
       
---
Good healers know when to let bad DPS die.  Good groups kick those DPS. 
---
Yeah, I spent $60 to upgrade my 1 year old laptop, best $60 I have spent. Makes a huge difference. 
---
Mediocre aoe with a 1 minute cooldown and half the time the mobs will get pulled out of it as soon as you start
---
Wait why does it not say Cool Cats? Sure do not remember losing to you plebs ever. What I do remember is Overen being a legit psycho and trying to sue Bixxby over the internet Lolololl
---
Arcane tho
---
Thanks. Had two 60s in vanilla. Full spelling of grats only took time away from people who were slower. 
---
I like how one guy is wearing wildheart shoulders haha.
---
Some of the videos from Derrida being wasted were great
---
Gotcha. I was still leveling my hunter when BC came out. I remember drain teams being powerful arena.
---
Thanks man, gotta check the video!
---
It was very relatable 
---
Your UI evolved so much between this and dinging 60. Truly beautiful. 
---
- all healing spells are direct cast heals. no hots, shields or anything. your only instant reaction heal is NS. so its kinda annoying. more healing spells would be nice. looking at priest healing toolkit in comparison.
---
and yeah in general a lack of healing spells, you got: 1. healing wave 2. lesser healing wave 3. chain heal. 
---
thats it, only 3 healing spells as a healer.
---
(ok and a healing totem. which is trash and barely ever used.) obviously you got different ranks, and its a saving grace, but still it all just a direct cast heals.
---
- you need to always worry about totems, and so they would be inrange of a melee. and they always charge forward and rush. and you sometimes need to drink or regen mana, or drag behind. and you need to spend gcd and mana on totems, which no other healer does, which decreases your potential hps in comparison to other healers. constantly reseting totems and managing drinking with it and everything. is annoying.
---
and make sure if you delay even for couple of seconds, or mess it up you get instantly get angry  whispers from melees demanding their totem to be up 100% of the time and in their eyes it should be the main priority. ofc it is the case for them, cos all they see is a dps meter and it messes up their dps numbers. So they always be annyoey with you if you delay totems even abit and even if the reason for that is completely reasonable.
---
cos sometimes you got other priorities a a healer. So be ready to be frustrated and find a lack of understanding from melees. which consider you a totem bot FOR THEM TO SHINE and their dps in comaprison to others, and healing or regening mana or drinking or any other concerns doesnt bother them at all.
---
- dps role isnt viable in raids.
---
to put it into some perspective: 
---
Say you're fighting a well geared SL warlock. 5000 hp unbuffed. With a voidwalker out. He will have 2x sacrifice shields from voidwalkers with his fel domination/master summoner talents. With imp voidwalker talent (which he will have as SL) each of these shields last 30 seconds and absorb 2400 damage, so 4800 extra "HP" to the warlock through these shields. Then he has his healthstone, which will restore 1440 HP. That's 11200 effective hp to burn through right there (vanilla average is like 3.5k), all the while the warlock is taking 40% reduced damage from you. (30% from soul link, and 10% from voidwalker master demonologist aura). To top it off, if you do manage to somehow kill him, he will soulstone and revive with 70% of his HP back. And literally one round of his corruption/curse of agony dots will almost kill you in 15 seconds if he gets in range to cast it on you. 
---
[This should suffice](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Texas-Instruments-TI-84-Plus-Programmable-Graphing-Calculator-10-Digit-LCD/3136045?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=6280&amp;adid=22222222228001131978&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=m&amp;wl3=40946858792&amp;wl4=pla-78888351272&amp;wl5=9057286&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=114496950&amp;wl11=online&amp;wl12=3136045&amp;wl13=&amp;veh=sem&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgoaphtms4AIVkYqzCh0HKgR3EAQYASABEgKrV_D_BwE)

What the fuck it's supposed to be scatman playing when they start fighting. This is an abomination
---
Wearing cloth until you have raid gear. It just feels so stupid.
---
It's french and I think references a server message from the Nostalrius team (some of which were french) in like 2016 that got massively memed for months after.
---
Me and my bro are doing the same thing. We are also not planning on being sweet beast raiders. We mainly quest, dungeon, and world pvp. We are playing warrior/priest. In fact we are doing that now on pserver and it’s awesome. We get groups so easily. Shaman/Druid will possibly compete with same armor drops in dungeons and stuff right?
---
the best form of crowd control is death
---
Long ago lost track of most, one might be back but too early to tell.  Have met new friends that want to play, so I'm hoping that will be just as fun!
---
No problem. Glad you enjoyed it.
---
World #1 Nyhm fanboy reporting in
---
Lost contact with all of them years ago, always wondered how life went for them, got some newer gaming friends so it'll be a new experience.
---
A good shaman and warrior can easily do the whole run in under 12 minutes. It was more common to do 3 man runs in my experience though.
---
The alter boss is done by kicking the sacrifice and positioning so the healer can los the damage while still healing the warrior.
---
Jewelry could also just be magically enhancing your stamina. You're able to fight on for longer, because the enchantment makes you feel lighter on your feet. Your ring makes your weapon feel lighter. Your necklace makes you more flexible.
---
Yep! I like the aesthetic of dwarves, joking aside, but If im playing one for 1000s of hours of game-time, Id rather it be a human.
---
[Healer] + [Mage/Lock] + [Warrior/Hunter]
---
Any of this type of combo works pretty well with the healer being a Priest/Pally/Shaman or a possibly Druid
---
Kargoz has a good video on duo leveling. I would watch that. https://youtu.be/8YCBd1VZVb4
---
I think this is why they get upset a lot. They don't have as much control over when things go to shit. And this is just a generalization from my experiences, and a large amount of it has been on retail. When I played classic last I was tanking while leveling, and a tank has *way* more authority in classic in dungeons, so they went very smooth and the healers were chill. But if you are ever leveling a character through retail (I wouldn't recommend it, its a *terrible* experience), particularly through dungeon finder, you find healers insulting others and bailing groups rapidly, as they can find another group so fast anyway the punishment is zero for them.
---
None, I don't think the majority of people who quit will. Mainly because MMO's attract all kinds of different people, many of whom don't fit the title of gamer and those who've quit most likely didn't play anything other than WoW so it was forgotten about and they moved onto other things. People who do fit the bill gamer tend to become attached to games since for us it's not just a hobby or a pastime, but we have a passion for games and obviously are more likely to keep tabs on games we've come to love even after quitting because we want a reason to come back. Sadly with WoW we've all probably had a reason only to be disappointed over and over and a lot of people playing today can't get out of that loop.
---
Fantastic reply . Yikes,yikes and yikes. I can see why that'd be a nightmare to deal with for any class,let alone a lategame hunter. Thanks a bunch for the replies,gonna have to choose my battles carefully !
---
Kick rocks is my personal favorite.  That’s a close second though lol
---
Well for one, ferals were *actually* garbage at classic's launch.
---
Patch 1.2 took Dire Bear from 125% to 360% armor increase - nearly tripling the additional mitigation the form provides. Before that, druids were genuinely terrible tanks, and a lot of people's memories of bear tanks from classic are colored by the pre-1.2 days.
---
Cats also found a few tricks over the years that allow them to be top DPS contenders (even against warriors and rogues). Using a Wolfshead Helm and the Furor talent, along with timing shifts before an energy tick, allows you to shift out and back into cat to go from 0 to 80 energy in a single tick. This level ~40ish blue helm is BIS for cat druids.
---
Another example of an unorthodox BIS item is the Manual Crowd Pummeler, a level 29 2H mace out of Gnomeregan. The stats are mediocre compared to an endgame weapon, but it has 3 charges of "Use: Increase your attack speed by 50% for 30 sec." Pserver ferals farm this weapon religiously, and will burn through multiple Pummelers in a single fight. The uptime on the buff is outrageous, either for cat dps or bear threat.
---
/sit to get crit isn't a abut
---
I don't have opinions or experience. I compiled this from opinions of different people from all over the internet the best I could.
---
People realized that if you farm 50 manual crowd pummelers every week you can keep the 50% speed buff up and do some crazy good dps, but you need to be good.
---
using a level 40 helm and (50) level 28 maces breaks the game.
---
At least 2.  Looking closer to 5-10 now though.  We will see.  Idk how long I’ll even keep up with it.  We all want t3 characters but forget the time investment needed for that xD
---
Even early raiding you go fury, your dps is never worth using a debuff slot on  mortal strike
---
Oh man as soon as the music started I knew which video this was.
---
The 10s you use to train enchanting could simply a lesser magic wand off the AH and level something else in the meantime.
---
Started working on some traditional-style mood paintings on Tirisfal Glades (and other areas), I'll be posting them here if ppl like this kind of stuff :)
---
I mean sometimes you are leveling and that’s just the best gear you can find.... 
---
I think the counter to the blacklisting point is that, what if it happens to the extent, where it happens so often that the blacklist gets saturated? There will be certain guilds or people that have their own bad credibility and reputation, but if it happens even remotely often, it's not hard to see that it could possibly be overlooked.
---
I could even see alot of people crying out against system-abusers, and a counter-backlash growing. "omg, stfu dude, stop complaining about your deadmines loot you lost"
---
I couldn't disagree more.
---
&gt;  wipes because threat was spread over multiple players and the healer need to waste mana doing inefficient, reactive heals, rather than staying on top of the tank's health in a predictable manner. 
---
Sorry, but that sounds to me like, "I can only heal when everything goes right."
---
An average healer is someone who is competent when the fight goes well.  When everyone does their job, when the damage comes at predictable times, the average healer responds accordingly and doesn't let people die.
---
Average healers are horrible at PvP.
---
A good healer will be able to react quickly to unexpected events and mitigate mistakes made by other players.
---
A great healer sees a mistake a player is about to make before he even makes it.  Great healers have total situational awareness and aren't just staring at the grid bars the entire time.
---
And bad healers?  They sit on their high horse and punish others for making mistakes by choosing not to heal.  Bad healers aren't good enough to keep the tank alive and respond to an emergency at the same time.  Bad healers blame the DPS and then kick him from the group.  Bad healers believe they're more valuable and harder to replace than that rogue who keeps attacking the wrong target.
---
Players who believe kicking people for making mistakes are... well, impatient and immature.  There's no other way to put it.  If a player is making mistakes, *teach* him.  Lift him up.  Don't beat him down, kick him out, and exclude him.
---
I see alot of constructive feedback and discussion on the subject. Theres ragers in every subject, but alot of people care about the game, to the extent that they will construct solid arguments and reasons why they are against the feature.
---
It looks like the guy in the video is using dismiss pet as an instant cast. How is he doing that? 
---
Shamans dont have a stun except for the tauren 2 sec stun but everyone knows orc is master race lol. All 3 specs are good for pvp but enhancement requires knowing when to drop the right totems and to be blessed by the four elements for the ultimate RNG...... stack crit. Elemental got dat BURST with natures swiftness and death ray you become a god and Resto makes for excellent BG healing if your team groups up together. best in AV and AB premades. Some of the worst things to shaman is no stuns and totems make shamans have the most keybinds for any class then throw engi on top it can get complicated sometimes simplicity is best.
---
How is Feral for PvP? I love Druid and mained one in BC when Feral was actually great for tanking and DPS. Debating rolling one for Classic but I really don't want to heal.
---
I played vanilla. I’ll post on the classic forums to prove it. All you have to do is check my achievements. Addons were in vanilla. I refused to use any of the ones that did my job for me. No changes means no changes that affect every player no matter what. If a player wants to get addons thats on them. 
---
A lot of healers are fucking garbage, because they like to giggle chat eFlirt, but ALL DPS have dog shit positioning and I give a fuck if they die.
---
Same. It’s the people who never played that want changes. 
---
I think a lot of Classic's "brokeness" is what made it so good.  It wasn't the sterile environment we have today.
---
I think TBC fixed the biggest holes and made it more playable without taking away too much from that vibe.
---
Yeah this is my take as well. The idea of "balance" just whooshing right over this guys head.
---
Druids got Abolish Poison and Remove Curse.
---
[Tanking class] + [healer class] + warlock makes for fast dungeons.  
---
I'm basing my duo on what my buddy picks.  
---
Shaman if horde warrior.  
---
Priest if he goes any Alli class, possibly druid + druid for damage return combo
---
He isn't. He directs his pet to run the opposite direction he is by targeting an enemy in that direction because when it gets far enough away it will automatically despawn. This prevents it from dying which would waste time. You can see him casting dismiss pet  with its usual long cast time throughout the video when he wants to just run by and feign without any pet distraction.
---
Thank you for explaining this.  I was irrationally mad that someone could have thought it should be written "an 10" - now knowing that it was just a typo has soothed me.
---
Thats a good question. For one the whole progression - leveling, gearing, pvp ranks and raiding wise - will be a lot faster. We will also see more unorthodox / underdog classes/specs being played such as ferals both as tank and dps, ret (and maybe prot) pally, shadow priests too maybe... lastly, the last biggest change will be how livestreaming will affect the game. In modern wow, everything you do is instanced, so the crowd of people following you around doesn't affect you, but in Classic its a whole different world. There are a lot of things I expect to change, but I'm on phone so no 100 pages of response. Sorey :p
---
I swear the "this sub is trash" comments are just as unhelpful. 
---
To the point though, I'd argue they have a point. Classic is about community, and if ninja-looting is done in an obvious, apparent manner, the blacklist is kept small, they will be on it, and there are consequences.
---
With loot trading, that same ninja can just trade a poor lowbie in their grp 3g to need on it for them, and while it isnt a 100% foolproof way to get your item, it's an abuse of the system that *works* and has *no consequence*.  
---
Anyone who plays/has played Classic knows there are douches in the game. Getting camped by a 60 is easy enough proof. But why would we introduce a system that is *very susceptible* to abuse? 
---
World or BGs?
---
Either way, you're not gonna be killing much but nobody is tankier or slippier. You're designated carrier in WSG.
---
Death Knight Spree was a classic! 
---
He was the whole reason I rolled a Blood Elf Warlock for a while haha
---
LOL
---
The 2 big things that will be different IMO are knowing the best ways to farm like you said, and people having a different approach to professions.
---
In vanilla only a handful of guilds on each server cared about things like flasks. Now more people are going to want to bring their A game and prep more for raids, so potions and herbs are going to be worth more. People will have less production professions like LW and BS so leather and ore will be worth a little less. People will want engineering more though so stone is going to me more valuable.
---
Thats just a bit that I can think of right now.
---
I want a commercial with Terry Crews playing a gnome!
---
Damn right they are. No clue what this guy is on about. 
---
Well, as I said, for warlocks everything works for everything. Seems like most people use a hybrid with varying depths of both. I will add that clarification, than you.
---
Great job! I've been working on something similar with some of the LH devs, but the data isn't in "human readable" format and I haven't had time to finish manually going through everything and this is much more nicely presented than how I could put it together. Thank you!
---
People are taking issue with your 2nd con. I get it, it's on you to not be a dick and help the asshole. But even if you don't give in to the extortion, it's obnoxious, makes me want to leave the grp and find another, which isn't always easy. If it happens often enough, and it may, cause loot is highly desirable, then I'll be pushed towards leaving 1 of every 2/3/4/5 groups i'm in. Still a problem.
---
Firemane leggins, BoE's with tons of better or free equivalencies still being worn at level 60 with a matching armor kini chest. C'mon...
---
Skinning/lw. I can make my own devilsaur set and potentially get a jump on the market.
---
Yes the fact that so many classes have 1 remotely viable spec is so amazing! 
---
“...HOW COME NONE OF THESE ZEBRAS HAVE HOOVES?!”
---
The average player willl wash out the concentration of good players or seasoned veterans from vanilla.  
---
The economy for the first couple months will be a buyer's market just because everyone will be trying to dump excess items with most players scrapping by each gold coin they can get for mounts and skills.
---
After a few months when a much larger % of players hti 60, then it becomes a seller market. But in the prior period veterans how know how to manipulate prices or what to stockpile will become very rich very quickly by playing World of Economics instead -- taking advantage of the fact the future classic wow player will just not be as well versed with item values.
---
Best way to make money early on will be aoe farming (non-AH sellables), pick pocketing, boss runs, and NPC vendorable items.
---
As more money pumps into the economy, then revenue sources via the AH will be the best source of income, as players will actually be buying more consumables/mats and prices will start to rise due to demand.
---
Great point. Gear is definitely a bear market.
---
Classic. The dueling moonfire spams when he starts fighting another druid is the best part.
---
Warlock/Druid has good synergy
---
All I know is that my tanks book cost 700 gold and I got o sell my eels for 1.5 on average, no one liked fishing in vanilla, I did 😃
---
 &gt; Players who believe kicking people for making mistakes are... well, impatient and immature. There's no other way to put it. If a player is making mistakes, teach him. Lift him up. Don't beat him down, kick him out, and exclude him.      
---
I always communicate before booting, but If your ears don't work, find a new group imho.  Your theoretical "Jesus Healer" that never runs out of mana and never misses topping up the tank, regardless of how much crap gets pulled doesn't exist.   Situational awareness means shit when your oom and your pot is on CD.  Stupid groups will put you in this situation repeatedly if you allow it. 
---
Regardless of your boundless compassion, stupid will win in the end.  If you really are a healer, you can't tell me you haven't run a pug where the tank chain-pulled four groups *after* you called oom, or a group where RDPS kept running ahead to "help the tank" by pulling groups..   You tell these guys to quit and much of the time, they "YOLO" and keep going, or tell you "I have looms" or "fuck off".   These are the same groups where they pull too many mobs and somehow lose aggro to the healer, but don't peel.  These are the guys that will, invariably blame you for failing to keep them up.    
---
        
---
You play how you like, I'll play how I like.  Maybe both of us will enjoy the game :)  
---
Nice work
---
M.A.G.E
---
Mining/engineering then switch to mining/herbalism at 60 I think.
---
But what about the giant shoulder pads you are missing out on?
---
One thing to keep in mind is classes like Hunter/Shaman/Druid have faster travel speed before level 40 so they are logical choices to quest together, for the simple reason that they will both get from point A to point B at about the same time (what level does Hunter get Aspect of the Pack?)
---
Yeah but you’ll find yourself missing Magic dispels big time. Sheep, Fear, and all caster roots/snares will give you difficulties
---
lol - I don't know where any of those people are - a couple might still be playing WoW, but we have all moved on from whatever guild we were in at the time. Great memories of that era...the best of times in WoW for me.
---
Warrior+Mage+pally/shaman depending on faction has really good synergy and returns.   You can swap in any healer, but I'm partial to the pally/warrior and sham/warrior synergy.  Literally everything 5man you do you can just fill with *any* two other players and go.
---
For a duo, drop the mage.
---
Mage/priest or warlock/priest has good returns also at least up to the 20s (as far as I've tested said duos), esp if one is a tailor.  Can plop just about any other class in as a third for a trio.
---
Any duo/trio combination of druids and rogues works well.
---
I meant how a warlock does the altar boss. Its done by enslaving a demon, having him tank for the most part and then DoTing up and kiting. 
---
Man idk, I remember how much I loved the 2+ hour AVs with zerging, turning in scraps and trying to spawn the boss etc.. I know it might be selfish but I really hope to fully experience Classic as I enjoyed it when I was a kid, even though it is very unlikely.
---
I suppose the entire economy will be very different from Vanilla for all of the reasons on your list here (except I don't think the repair bill effect will be more than negligible).  A big impact will be made by players who start off from level 1 with the objective to make money with their professions instead of gearing themselves out.  When vanilla launched, nobody knew how to make money, and what would end up selling.  As we leveled and geared up, we kind of figured out what there was a good demand for (usually crafting/gathering materials).  
---
I haven't played any private servers and I don't plan to, but I'm going to level alchemy and herbalism for the sole purpose of money making.  I paid for my first epic mount that way (it was my first epic item).  I sold swiftness potions, black lotus, arcanite bars, fadeleaf, goldthorn....actually most of the level 20+ herbs sold very well.  If these items don't sell again in classic, I'll just sell raw herbs, or level mining on my alt and sell ore.
---
I've actually watched this is was pretty helpful, narrowed down our options a bit
---
No the druid is planning on healing but also wouldn't mind off tanking (I believe). It's less about needing a healer and more about me play testing a priest on a private server and loving it so much.
---
I am curious - are feral tanks a bit better for dungeons while leveling since they tend to be spec'd for it?
---
Girl = Guy In Real Life
---
I'm just not a massive fan of warrior to be honest, I did consider priest though, and yeah Shaman/Druid use similar gear but at 40 Shaman uses mail and I imagine I'll use weapons as a Shaman that a druid can't use, I've also heard that Druids are quite gear independant based on their forms... And my bro wants to be able to play lots of roles (tank or dps or healer)
---
Generally raids have one enchancement shaman as pet/melee buffer.  This shaman will frequently take the \[Enhancing Totems\] talent as well as possibly the \[Improved Weapon Totems\] talent (either 1 or 2 points into the latter as filler).  
---
Yeah I remembered that. Do you have the link to the original?
---
I really like it. 
---
Tirisfal is, to me, the best starting zone blizzard ever made. The first time i saw some corpses hanging from a tree, it added so much to the eerie atmosphere.
---
Dude I got a belf lock to 22 like 7-8 times lol! 
---
Why wouldn't they just roll again?
---
40, I think.  Don't quote me on that.
---
If you have 5 warriors in your raid and you're not a hardcore guild, at least one will be Specced MS and that one debuff will be shared by all warriors. It's better to not have them Specced with deep wounds than MS.
---
Fury doesn't pull even until BWL gear and doesn't truly outshine until AQ40.
---
They still dont. Oily blackmouths are worth a ton on my private server.
---
&gt;4 bag slots are "wasted" on totems.  Not a huge deal, and a better deal than hunters and warlocks get (maybe better than rogues, too), but still a cost to play the class.
---
True.  
---
&gt;Players want Windfury, even if it makes the pull aggro and die.  You can't give them Totem of Less Threat (blanking on the name) because it is the same totem class as Windfury and they don't want to lose WF.
---
Totem of Tranquil Air.  And it's useless.  If  you're in a 5 man dungeon and you drop it, its essentially wasting mana because you're reducing EVERYONE's threat, including the tanks...so it's only good for specific raid groups.  The plus side is, it's an excellent totem to use for a dedicated Warlock group in raids.  They often have trouble as they gear up (they scale REALLY well with gear) managing threat, and they don't get blessing of salvation like their Alliance counterparts.  And since the de-facto air totem (Grace of Air) is wasted on them anyways, it's the best totem to put in caster groups (could work for a mage group as well).
---
&gt;Totem management can be a pain.  You can't pull totems like in later expansions, so you have to plan ahead where your totems are going to go.  It also takes 6 seconds worth of GCDs for you to be "combat ready" by dropping all of your totems down, and you have to keep track of them.  
---
&gt;Action bar space used for totems (less of an issue with a totem bar addon).  
---
&gt;The fact that for PvE, there's only one race worth picking (Troll) and that race in general has among the weakest racials of the faction.
---
The racials for PvE are so non-existant horde side they are practically in space.  The only racial ever worth mentioning is WOTF for undead.  Everything else is just useless grinding/leveling/solo crap or is only useful in PvP.
---
Shamans can't dispel magic either.  They have purge, but they can't get rid of sheep, fear, or roots.
---
Thank you so much. This is scarily close to my irl situation (not the cave troll part!).
---
I appreciate it a lot. If you mind me asking, could you do it again? To see if there’s a big difference, or not at all?
---
I truly believe you don't understand how much more we know about the game. But even that aside, there is an enormous difference with original vanilla, it's the 1.12 talents. Warriors were shit dps early on in vanilla, in classic they will be monsters from the get go. 
---
Man, I'ma be rollin in it then,. hopefully enough to fund all my basic tank needs
---
Tremor totem removes fear and grounding Totem gives you am on-demand way to prevent a lot of those spells. Shamans kinda trade defensive dispels for pressure tools, they’re very offensive for a support/hybrid class
---
&gt;Mages have whatever that fire spell is that resets them to half hp when they nearly die. 
---
That's not a heal in the traditional definition of the word. That's like saying Purgatory is a heal.
---
&gt;They also have THREE different shields, each of which count as healing.
---
They've had three different shields since the game came out, no one has **ever** called that healing.
---
&gt; EDIT: AND they can spell steal heals over time.
---
My dude come on, now you are just grasping for fucking straws here.
---
Yeh, I made mistakes in vanilla, like not knowing rank 11 gloves were bis. Also I am going alliance this time for pally buffs.
---
A quick Google search [delivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ) 
---
Deep wounds is lower priority than MS, and if your spec'd into MS you sure as shit have deep wounds as well. Not taking impale would be ridiculous
---
Here's a top tip- use overripe bananas. Not like mouldy or anything, but you ever forgotten about some bananas and they get black spots on the peel? Well you want 'em like that, just let those bad boys blacken up well past the point where they're too soft to eat. The blacker the better really. [Here's a good article detailing why,](https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2018/09/03/the-best-bananas-for-banana-bread/) plus a recipe link at the bottom. I haven't personally tried their recipe but that site is generally excellent so I'm sure it's delicious!
---
Also, it's fun to experiment with various additions &amp; tweaks. I'm a fan of adding sultanas to the mix just before baking. A splash of spiced rum or Cointreau is nice too, but it can take a few goes to get the balance right.
---
But did you know that banana plants grow up to 25 feet high, and their leaves can grow to be 9 feet long and 2 feet wide? Their roots can be hundreds of years old. 
---

With a trio mage would be handy for faster group travelling.
---
I think people overanalyze this kind of stuff. If you guys want to shaman and Druid just go for it. I’ve played several classes in vanilla. Only two to 60 and I realize that at the end of it, it doesn’t matter what class you play. The experience is what makes the game worthwhile.  Unless you play hunter. Complete meme class.
---
&gt; You couldn't steal a piece of gear and get away without members of your party/raid at least knowing about that.
---
&gt; With loot trading you can.
---
Is this because your a dipshit whom can’t tell when someone actually needs an item or simply pinched it because it was shiny? 
---
If this so I’m so sorry that you are so retarded because I have fucking eyes and a memory so I can tell what classes can and can’t use, I can look out for visual signs, inspect players, use the forums, write in guild a trade chat and be an all round vigilant player for people being an asshole. You what loot trading does? It allows people to resolve situations to a satisfactory conclusion when people are actually being idiots or simply dipshits. 
---
So the huntard needed the tank’s shield, well now we can explain to the huntard that hunters can’t use shields and the huntard having been convinced can then give it back to the tank. 
---
Perhaps I’m misjudging you and what you really mean to say, is that this system will encourage people to be dickheads just in case they can get away with it. And this is true but despite being a life long pessimist, I’m more willing to believe idiocy is to blame than see conspiracy. 
---
I was with you until Boogerfeast. That man needs a raid leader position.
---
3 Pals. Prot/Ret/Holy.
---
Wasn't that a wrath thing?
---
Do you think there will be a lot of shaman warrior combos? Compared to people picking priest?
---
Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ) with Scatman that I think many will remember. Was reuploaded because a Beatles song needed to be replaced.
---
Just nickname them - PQ, Mouthy, CV and Boogey sounds like cool guys.
---
Alright, let me share what I know.
---
Druid leveling as boomkin is kind of slow, you are constantly hungering for mana. This including that the levling resto seems a bit overkill as dmg&gt;heal is more worth aslong as you can kill the mob before it does too much dmg on you, meaning if you are 5 people you dont need to spec resto to pick up the majority of healing. The same thing applies to instances, you can heal fine enough with a feral, enhancement spec if you make sure to have a int gear. Since a boomkin will still be gathering int gear it kind of makes sense to me that he would be in charge of a majority of healing.
---
Feral druids might take about the same dmg as a fury tank,  in instances it will most likely be worth it but if you have a fury tank in world questing with 4 people behind him I have a hard time seeing why a feral druid tank would do much better.
---
But in a dungeon where the warrior will have tanking gear with a shield and specced fury a feral druid will most likely outperform him in everything but defensive stats, they should be taking about the same amount of dmg but ferals having much easier to maintain aggro.
---
Having a mage will also bring you water, most of you have chosen a mana hungry class
---
I don't think they understand us like they used to. 
---
Either would be a useless process that would take time. =)
---
If I would die in RL, my inner gamer would TOTALY LOVE such an epic pvp brawl in my honor. GG!
---
For (again, really abusing this term) PvE heros, due to the nature of Shaman's totems, you ideally want 7-8 shamans in a raid.
---
Most Private servers and class pick %s point to Shamans/Paladins being around 6-12%.  That doesn't go into account that many of these shamans will also want to be Enhance which are basically useless in raids, too.
---
Priest on horde side is always in demand, too.  Troll and Undead priest racials for shadow are op as fuck compared to their alliance counterparts.  So PvE priests will also be in high demand.
---
But with people knowing what they know now, as alliance be aware that you'll see a LOT more Shaman + Warrior WF purge wombo combos running around on PvP servers.
---
That's my $0.02 anyway.
---
Untrue. "Dedicated Ferals" on private servers destroy hunter dps.
---
The only question is if Feral performs the same in Classic. I won't be convinced of any private server to Classic conversion until the math is proven.
---
Going into enemy WSG flag room and MCing people off the roof into falling dmg+your murderball below.
---
Ok, thanks, priest at heart but was looking at that warrior WF combo. We'll see what plays out.   
---
Another question: would you say priest is more in demand on horde or alliance?
---
What? As far as pure healing sets go.  Full Earthfury was the tits.  If your guild was progressing well enough the recommended build was 5 Earthfury/3 Ten Storms to maximize the heal synergy between the two sets, though arguably the Ten Storms set was one of the better looking classic sets in the game.
---
The ZG set was suited to elemental/resto hybrids and was pretty good in PvP since it increased the duration of frost shock AND improved the range of lightning bolt by yards, letting you shine in mexican showdown situations like AV bottlenecks.
---
AQ20 set is a top tier set for elemental shaman since it improves the Chain Lightning multiplier by 5% per jump. And was well suited to hybridize with the ZG set since they could both be worn with no overlaps in set pieces.  Back in vanilla retail once I finished my ZG set, my guild let me drop from healing and go elemental and it was a blast to play as at that point it was actually somewhat viable to go elemental (Elemental scales way better with the right gear IMO)
---
The only set that seemed out of place was the AQ40 set since it had both elemental and resto set bonuses that were at odds with one another and seemed rather lackluster...
---
:O I did not! Thank you, /u/BananaFactBot! 
---
It would be beyond pathetic if people approach Classic as just another private server. I intentionally stayed away from raiding and ranking on private because it was a watered-down experience. I also never cared about enjoying the leveling experience as the only thing that mattered to me was spending as little time as possible doing poorly scripted/tuned content while leveling so I would just rush to 60 using whatever nonblizzlike methods were available. 
---
In Classic I intend to enjoy the game, something I never could on private. The truth behind the success of servers like Nostalrius is that quantity of players &gt; quality of server - put enough players on a server and people will look past all its flaws. Sadly people think that you need 10K+ players in Classic just because private servers had to rely on mega pops to be enjoyable. 
---
r/therealjoke 
---
Tons of alliance players are far more PvE oriented, and love to roll holy dwarf priest, or roll as a female nelf for... *reasons*...
---
For PvE, there is definitely far more demand for demand horde side, since many horde players are more PvP oriented and the racials for shadow priests on horde are pretty stronk/10.
---
You'll be in high demand on alliance if you roll as a dwarf, or as non-shadow on horde. I'd say more in demand on horde.
---
Had a rogue in TBC called Ballss. Got the salty title, made a guild &lt;in your mouth&gt; and was promptly reported
---
[https://www.hate-guild.eu/media/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/media/) here is Quatro, our old friend and officer in Hate doing some pvp as rank 14 mage + bwl and aq40 gear (2nd and 3d vid). Server was Boulderfist-EU, 2006.
---
Haha this made me laugh, when we played vanilla my bro played hunter so neither of us will be playing hunter this time around
---
&gt; you can get through an entire aimed shot cast while stealthed.
---
That was fixed during Vanilla, shouldn't be in Classic.
---
&gt; As hunter you have one of the best tools for beating paladins in viper sting
---
Not really. Unless the paladin is braindead, they'll spam dispel it and you'll be oom before them. Forcing a ret pally oom while kiting him takes forever and you straight up can't oom holy pallies. It's really strong against priests though.
---
&gt; Trolls are also pretty good for PVE with bow bonus and berserking
---
Trolls are only slightly better. Berserking adds up to only a handful of autoshots per boss fight while the bow racial is pretty useless since you already get so much hit from items and only need 9%.
---
My bro and friend are coming back for sure, forming a devastating melee squad of shaman, warrior and rogue. We dem ORC BOIS
---
if that's any consolation, resto druids had it much worse... between dispels, fears and silence, a good shadow priest could basically shut them down completely, for a long, long time.
---
This is the mind of a dimwitted, low 80s IQ, blow all CDs, dumbass Rogue who stands out side of SW and thinks he knows the game on any level.
---
You hated TBC, because you couldnt pull that shit off, as people would out play you and hand your sorry low rent ass back to you.
---
Players like you hung around 1400 rating in 2's and you were easy identify. You looked for partners in general and trade chat, who you blamed for your inability to play.
---
bad meme....
---
This is my favorite comment of the week.
---
“POWERRRRRR!” *Gnomish deathray intensifies*
---
It was, but it was wonderful.
---
Other than there generally being less people who don't know how to play?  Nothing much, there wasn't really much left to theory craft in vanilla.
---
So pedantic troll it is.  
---
[Here](https://books.google.dk/books?id=BPwKMtLMM0EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) it is then. 
---
They're the best. The only niche they aren't the best at is aoe groups where mages are better and fights where kiting isn't possible as locks can just fearspam+outlast mobs.
---
You can solo most dungeons but it's so tedious you should do it for the challenge more than for the gear. Raid trash can't be soloed outside of ZG trash by mages and 1-2 packs in Naxx by 2-3man groups.
---
Check out the [Hunter vs World](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaWLJ5UhLSSLv-Z7pK7XO8QbZ6L6sLdnk) series from back in the day. It showcases how well hunters can do in dungeons by themselves.
---
When people hear "Balance" (especially live Wow players) they ONLY talk about Raiding.
---
Classic class balance is the best balance of any version of wow (one must ignore gear in this statement because the scaling and balance issue comes more from raid and late pvp rewards more than class mechanics) when considering the TYPE of game it was INTENDED to be.
---
Wow was designed as an open world adventure game. Raiding was a late addition and consideration as an end game. The class design was intended NOT to be 1v1 but as a small group dynamic. This falls apart in a more 1 dimensional strategy game like raiding. 
---
Wow fell into the same trap as most massive mmorpgs. The game is too large to continue to develop in the same way as the core game was during it's initial development phase prior to launch. Raiding came about for one reason: to maximize player participation within minimum content development. It's about money.
---
This is why end game in mmorpgs often have nothing to do with the core game you leveled in. Classic class design wasn't created for raiding. This balance change started in TBC because they used to expansion to make the change toward the minimized content for maximum players concept which means raiding and arena. This was the start of the shocking change in direction for class balance. 
---
Classic had the lowest overall raid participation through all tiers as later expansions (at least past TBC). The majority of the player base never even entered Naxx. BGs are still dynamic enough to not worry about 1v1 balance. Raids are still easy enough in early tiers to not worry about balance between each and every spec.
---
Classic was not designed for raiding. That is why it plays so completely different than later Wow versions. It's what needs to be preserved.
---
Let me take a crack at this...
---
- Enhance Shamans are the most common and by far useless shamans (They are the ret of horde, except for the occasional lucky WF proc)
---
- Very Prone to running out of mana, either healing or spamming lightning at people's faces.
---
- No natural mana regen/recovery while casting talents, unlike mages, priests, druids, and warlocks.  Only source is the green dragon armor which then has no +healing.  Still half decent tho. Mana spring totem benefits the person who doesn't cast it the most.
---
- Enhance Shamans are one of the most squishy targets in the game. No real defensive tools, or escape ability.  Ele and resto have at least shields for high armor and mana for healing/NS.
---
- Totem management is a sharp learning curve. Almost all totems will need to be actively binded at all times in both PvE and PvP. Almost every GCD cycle will be dedicated to casting spells or dropping totems.
---
- No ranged auto attack like other casters.  Cloth classes have wands to fall back on for decent sustainable free dps. Shamans must rely on weapon auto attacking at melee range with weapon enhancements -- which leaves them in melee range and prone to high miss % with white damage.
---
- Leveling with ele can be fast, under the assumption you have water to chug.  So fast, or expensive. Unless you know a Mage to hook you up.
---
Kick rocks

The deadliest all around duo in my experience was back in original Wow release when I was playing my Warlock with my friend's Shadow Priest.
---
We 2 manned the entire WSG enemy team at times (when they weren't pre-made). It's an ungodly combo in pvp if you have even semi-decent gear.

---
Who was playing MMOs when you got called a Mangina for playing a female character?
---
Uncommon but it was very real. Warlocks getting fear off as rogue vanish etc.
---
Some people might say we don't need it anymore with good latency and higher bandwidth etc but there's no real harm having spell batching included.
---
You'd always want Salv, Might/Wisdom and Kings though, and preferably Sanc aswell. If you're not running 3-5 holy paladins, a ret will do more than another warrior.
---
Go sand rocks.
---
Seems impossible to find a real vanilla video clip, maybe digging through WCM archives would help (who has the time?).
---
Spell batching did exist, and the best example is Rogue Gouge &gt; Mage blink. Mage would blink ahead as normal, but be gouged at the same time at the destination.
---
Or you did and weren’t aware. It was quite rampantly abused on people’s alts after it was implemented. 
---
Get a majority guild group of alts run the ICC 5 mans roll on each other’s loot and give it to each other. Fuck the pug from the other server. That’s how you gear an alt to ICC raid ready in no time.
---
See you are talking about changes over time.  Things added, fixed, broken at specific points as the game evolved.  IMO you are being unreasonable expecting private servers to replicate the changes over time.  All your examples are changes.
---
Private servers picked a specific point in the server's history and used that information.  Based on that point in Vanilla WoWs progression, Private servers have replicated the gameplay and experience quite well.  
---
I still remember my first time leaving this area on my second character, I had just re-rolled from a lock (didn't like the game play) to a rogue and saw a monster with a gray dragon around the portrait. I had no idea what that meant at the time, but I knew I hadn't seen it before, and knew it had to die. 
---
My low level ass couldn't take it down though, died like 10 times before giving up. In hindsight I should've grouped with someone to fight it with me but I was so new to the game I didn't know how to do that and, at the time, I was much more introverted than I am now and had trouble making that first step to connect with people, oddly enough, WoW was one of the first steps in "curing" that about me, since it forced you to interact with people to get some stuff done. 
---
Can't wait for this summer. Great work on the painting, btw! 
---
Probably 25% of them that I still talk to at least, which is 7 friends (5 of them are long time IRL friends). 
---
I'm still hopeful that a few old online friends will message me over BattleNet when classic WoW releases though. As of now all of them have been offline for years, so.. one can only hope.
---
Warlock + Shadow Priest as a core duo is sick for most situations. Their weakness can easily be made up with a 3rd member. I'd imagine nearly anything would work but the extremes of either a hunter or a warrior would go really well depending on strategy.
---
A friend I made in early Vanilla and I have been talking about this forever, we were both so happy when Classic was announced. Since then we have each talked a few of our old guildies into coming back. Not enough to get the band back together, but it will be good to play with them again.
---
Absolutely - I know I recorded a few of drunken ventrillo chats. If they still exist, they would be on an old hard drive in a box in storage.
---
Of the options given i would say druid/warlock since you said you want a quality 1-60 experience over anything. Druid being able to tank for easy groups is just too good to pass up imo. Shamans and druids do not synergize at all together, and you share gear til 40 which sucks.
---
If there's no phasing between zones then there's no reason it wouldn't be possible.
---
Note: Transcended's success only occured because we had Mallius's blessing going into Naxx.
---
I certainly wouldnt say TBC "just made thigs better." While different specs became more viable, the true sense of being a hybrid class disappeared. While gear and spec made you more proficient at DPS or healing in vanilla, gear and spec were end all, be all in terms of what you were capable of doing.
---
If you werent heal specd, you would heal to little and not have enough mana even in good healing gear. Likewise, farming was god awful in heal spec, much worse than vanilla. Even if you were dps spec, in dps gear in vanilla, you can transition to healing midfight and still be useful, not at all the case in TBC
---
&gt;Does anyone else still keep in touch with some friends from vanilla/BC? 
---
1, the person who helped me get my epic mount. She got me 500g and I never had to pay it back. We got really close back then and still talk to each other once in a great while, I'm probably going to ping her when there's a release date and ask if she's down to play. 
---
Unfortunately I lost contact with all my old guild mates after Myspace bit the dust as a social media platform, then they deleted my account for inactivity (which sucks because I had a few messages from now dead friends saved on there that I would read from time to time). 
---
I think that when I renew my sub for Blizz I'm going to make a post on the official forums (or lurk and see if someone else does) and try to reconnect with some of my old guild mates and people I used to play with, and maybe jump on retail and message some of the ones that still play. 
---
Some people might die less, but the people who have not played vanilla before will realise, that even couple of mobs can get you killed, not to mention about elites. People will get caught off guard by aggro radius and simply by the fact, that mobs are much more deadly.
---
"Ability damage". You know it still has its damaged reduced by armor right? It's not spell damage. It just doesn't scale with weapon damage im vanilla.
---
Every game I've had the choice and chosen to play a female hero over a male hero there would be points where something just felt off 
---
 playing as a female and I regretted the decision I made.
---
&gt;  IMO you are being unreasonable expecting private servers to replicate the changes over time. 
---
Fucking nowhere am I expecting private servers to replicate these changes though... 
---
Of course private servers had to pick one point in time, 1.12, and replicate this patch. Those servers started raid progression starting with MC on patch 1.12. This is no problem for me and I wouldn't expect or demand anything else. No idea where you got that from...
---
But the point is that this is nothing like the original Vanilla experience. Starting on patch 1.12 with raid progression is nothing like Vanilla. Not even close. Again, nothing wrong with that, it's just what it is. 
---
OP is talking about **preserving Vanilla and replicating an extremely close version of Vanilla.** and then acts like private servers did that, which they didn't though.
---
Blizzard won't offer an extremely close replication of the original game either and that's fine. I don't care which version they release. I ll enjoy it regardless of that. OP is simply full of shit and has no idea what he is talking about.
---
Lol I did too. I mean I was 13 and wanted to be Legolas...I cringe thinking about playing hunter and how fking bad I probably was.
---
Can you give examples of  world PvP/organized PvP distinctions? I assume elemental shamans are better for world PvP while elementals are better at battlegrounds. More generally, melee classes are better at world PvP as far as I heard. But other than that I don't know much.
---
Warlock: if you're talking about the blood pact, here's what the wiki says: "However, lack of Blood Pact is not a big problem for warlock himself, because stamina gained from 5-point Demonic Embrace talent usually exceeds the benefit of Blood Pact. It should be noted that Demonic Embrace also increases stamina from buffs such as Power Word: Fortitude or Blood Pact." I don't claim to be an expert though, all I heard is that people do use it. The wiki has a comprehensive review of all advantages and disadvantages of all the common builds.
---
Priest: regarding leveling and farming in disc, one person on WoW forums said that PI is helpful for mages. Another one said "you could heal dungeons and you could still kill things solo and in pvp".
---
Hunter: "requires gear" is only in regards to PvP. For PvE I heard that only marksmanship is viable, but I might be wrong.
---
Will correct disc regarding PvE and feral druid thanks.
---
It's not vanilla. To me classic is vanilla and the first two expansions.
---
Show me the last time it was posted here.  
---
Haven't seen any tbh. Some real life buddies are coming back but thats it.
---
I always wondered why people crafted the headband instead of the tunics since they both have a static 60s craft time so your gold/hour is determined by whatever has the highest profit:
---
1g 30s/stack of leather = 6.5s/leather
---
Silken Thread - 5s
---
Cast time of craft = 60s
---
Tunic = 7 leather 2 silken thread = 55.5s
---
Vendor Price: 59.71
---
Profit: 4.21s Profit/Hour: 2g 53s
---
Headband = 5 leather 2 silken thread = 42.5s
---
Vendor Price 44.95
---
Profit: 2.45s Profit/Hour: 1g 47s
---
Unless I'm missing something. 
---
I did the Dirge's Kickin' Chimaerok Chops for 8 people and 100$ of lamb later, I was in eternal spicy bliss. I did feel my stamina go up.
---
That book is great, you can literally feed yourself nostalgia.
---
Saying you have to play the same gender in game as you are in real life is like saying only fat men living in their parents basement play wow. 
---
Get outdoors and show some self respect. If you can get off that chair anymore anyways.
---
| I know this will be downvoted, because most horde players do exactly this.
---
This is the only correct answer
---
Seriously such a good episode. 
---
“What do we do now?”  
---
“What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.”
---
WoW Classic is the name blizzard came up with and it means the remake of vanilla, it has nothing to do with TBC tho
---
I dislike this because adding a RNG element to DKP negates the whole point of DKP - fair distribution based on effort by each player.
---
Counter-example:
---
Person|DKP
---
:--|:--
---
Hunter|0
---
Warrior|0
---
Rogue|150
---
Item = Sword
---
Person|Roll
---
Hunter|43
---
Warrior|100
---
Rogue|14
---
The rogue "buys" additional rolls:
---
56
---
99
---
A proper DKP system would likely have ended up giving the sword to the rogue. In this situation it does not *because anyone for whom it's an upgrade can roll*.
---
Bad meme.
---
Why add so much complexity? It doesn't make more loot drop. And it doesn't really help anyone get the loot they earned easier. 
---
You sound like Alexensual
---
Sharding/lfg and other modern things. 
---
However I also believe moving the community away from the game (discord etc..) will already majorly change the experience and might even ”ruin” the experience :/
---
I’d like to know what UI raidframes these are and those buff times, anyone know?
---
A lot of things was in the demo... thats why its a "demo"
---
Yessss! This needs to happen.
---
I kinda doubt that. Rogue are great DPS, a blast to play, and great in PvP (especially world PvP).
---
People are way overblowing the min/max nature of classic WoW. I'd wager most people don't go about it that way.
---
Additionally, if we're directly comparing what it'll be with original classic back in the day, the value of most world drop BoE epics will be far less. 
---
Less than half of players raided back then and epic gear was less accessible. That, combined with less knowledge of optimal itemization, inflated the perceived value and the price of BoE epics on the AH.
---
Most of them will not be bought at high prices.
---
Blackrock.
---
Nothing beats an Argent Dawn server raid. 
---
You mean every class doesn’t have a sprint, aoe stun, and bubble? Clearly bad design as I want to be a Rogue-paladin-DH-priest 
---
I think the number one thing we're gonna see come classic launch is a bunch of people absolutely floored that some of their private server strats don't work.
---
Private servers didn't have the actual data that Blizzard has from the original game. They did the best they could to try and replicate the numbers but it's gonna be imperfect. I can't wait for private server players to cry foul when numbers differ from their private servers and claim blizzard "changed things".
---
No podcast option :( 
---
It always made me laugh that the cultists in Blackfathom Deeps are carrying around moist cornbread in their pockets.
---
Leveling in WoW isnt exactly rocket science, its cruise control :D 
---
Why is that so high in gold value? Aren't the oily blackmouth mats just used for free action potions?
---
I'm a p server premade veteran
---
There's been no great advancement in trading. Auctioneer was around in vanilla, people played the AH like they play it today.
---
Nah u dont
---
RIP u/vernetroyer I loved his commercial too
---
Mines a fact backed by experience some ppls opinion are better than others deal with it I played p server premades for years
---
I mean technically you are correct, without the code no one can replicate it exactly.  I assumed it was strongly implied (since we all know there is no code) that they do the best possible job with the information they have.  Private servers did that based on Youtube videos.  Blizzard will do that with whatever code they have left over.  Blizzard's version will probably be better since they have more information, but I bet the private server folks put more blood, sweat and tears into their work.
---
DIdnt you answer that question your self?   
---
" It would simply be a waste of time to spend 3-4 months leveling a toon that you know you will abandon. "  
---
dafuq? :D 
---
I think in the economy of classic is where you'll see this huge chasm between what private server players know about the game and people who've either never played ever or since retail classic. 
---
Oh idk what any of it was used for haha, I was an enchanter skinner in vanilla and my alt had herbalism to send shit to the gm. Then I was given pots and flasks at raid time. I never cared back then!
---
LOOL mad retail kid? I'll 1v1 u any class any spec on a vanilla ptr. 
---
Or just higher level hostile mob radius size. Even in like Wrath or Cata, they got reduced dramatically. 
---
I think the more important question is when will we get beta, that might come way earlier
---
DUDE i still have nightmares of these 3 mages goonsquading around Cenarion Hold
---
Hey mommy blizzard me wanna play my special snowflake spec and me dont take no for answer! Lmao ur the typical retail cuck who gonna destroy classic with ur whining.
---
WC average donjuan time prob like 7hrs 45 min
---
During TBC, I rerolled to a priest because I thought prayer of mending was such a cool ability: ping ping ping. I absolutely loved playing it through TBC &amp; WoTLK. So many utilities to fix other peoples shit, that was so much fun back then. Thoroughly enjoyed keeping stupids alive, made me feel like a god. Because of that, I always befriended the tanks, which was a nice added bonus.
---
If could help it, I would never let dumbasses die, it would mean more downtime for the entire group.
---
Mana management was also such a fun factor, especially if you have a good tank that's chainpulling. You have a split second to press your water keybind, before entering combat again. Gave me such a thrill, to be never at full mana throughout a whole dungeon. Constantly having everything on cooldown.
---
When the morons started shit talking, I just posted detailed info on damage taken in the group chat. That made them shut their mouth, most of the time. Which was good enough for me. In any case the tank always had my back, even if they were friends with the brainlet dps. Glorious times, honestly probably the best years of gaming for me.
---
I'm not sure how much I'll enjoy playing priest in Classic though, so I decided to just make it an alt. Played mage in Vanilla &amp; on Nost, so I'll stick with that as main in Classic.
---
Yes that's what I said.... 
---
Because many talent trees were purposely left unfinished because the class design team started work on TBC. Two prime examples are [Protection Paladins:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd-Zt8bueFk)
---
&gt; “It’s one of those things where we didn’t have the idea worked out yet and we didn’t want to just band-aid it by giving him a taunt, because once you give him a taunt you can’t take it away, right? Like anything less than that or even different than that and people are going to be like, why? why would you do this to us, just give us the thing back. It’s very difficult to take mechanics away. **We didn’t have the total specific idea worked out on how he was actually going to taunt** so we were still experimenting and learning as we went.”
---
... and [non-Resto shamans:](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-shaman/668634.htm)
---
&gt; “Right now the class team is heavily focused on the expansion. We will be announcing details of what's in store for each class in the weeks to come. There are a number of improvements we're considering for Shamans in expansion, such as improved totem UI and functionality. I've also been studying the development of new talents and abilities for each class, and so far I'm fairly excited at what I've seen for the Shaman. Despite the belief that no one reads the Shaman boards (ironically, our loudest forum), we're fully aware of the feedback that's been expressed here, and will do what we can to address it. **Much of the improvement players are demanding will have to wait until the Burning Crusade launches, which isn't too far off.**”
---
Problem is, the demo wasnt tempting at all, im extremly excited for classic, wanted vanilla back since TBC already, and yet i didnt buy the demo, why? How short the period is, its only 1 zone and the limited playtime. So even if the beta was to see the intrest, i dont the numbers are close to accurate. No1 i know who is extremly excited about classic played the demo.
---
Lol what's with all the retail kids who wanna "balance" vanilla lmfao? This sub has gone to shit. RIP.
---
Quite possibly, but the conversation I usually have with people from old vanilla guilds goes something like this.
---
Me - Oh you were in Guild Y, cool I was in guild X
---
them - Oh cool do you know player1 player2 player3 that were in guild y and transferred to guild x
---
Me - Yes, I played with those 3 players, small world friend.
---
Maybe they were just all lucky guesses? 
---
I'd say not having separate UI for totems, maybe.
---
But also, and I know this isn't a huge deal because there are lots of garbo specs, but elemental shaman is truly awful in PvE. The max rank lightning bolt does a whole 150-200 damage less than max rank Frostbolt or Shadowbolt. And then those latter two spells gets upgraded with the AQ tomes I believe. 
---
&gt; It would be beyond pathetic if people approach Classic as just another private server.
---
You're gonna be in for a bad time then... RIP. Private servers are the test-bed for how modern (and returning) players are going to interact with WoW—because the population is made up of modern (and returning) players.
---
I love Shaman but they have such a better niche in BC. Elemental is actually viable there.
---
That's too specific for this generalized list, but I'll add a note on priest leveling versatility, thank you.
---
3. did you play vanilla? You not gonna be switching specs on the fly lol, that 50 or 60 gold is a crazy ammount of money.  
---
There is a ton of information out there about changes to quests, classes and items over time. Blizzard co obviously isn't going to change stuff so they can change it again a few months later. They made those balance changes for a reason after all.
---
Point is, privat servers are nothing like the original vanilla experience. Period.
---
&gt;I bet the private server folks put more blood, sweat and tears into their work.
---
Maybe, I don't know and it is irrelevant here.
---
Which is an extremely important potion for both pvp and pve
---
I understand this, and my example covers this drawback (including the fact that people tend to not like RNG), but consider this - how many times do you see someone roll 100?
---
With that said, I completely understand, that is why I am asking for input - this may very well be a shit system. 
---
From what I have heard, the fault of DKP was that it made people hold off on "buying" good upgrades because they were saving up for the BEST upgrade, resulting in good gear being disenchanted because no one wants to spend DKP on it, and resulting in an inflation of DKP and the person with most DKP being GUARANTEED the item despite the fact that the person with the second highest DKP also put in a LOT of effort but did not have a chance against the MOST hardcore player. This system also kind of solves the problem of inflation because DKP is more likely to be spent because you are buying chances, not guarantees - if an item drops in a regular DKP system, one person spends all his points, buys it, the other members keep holding on to theirs. In my system, you could have ALL people spend X amount of DKP, rather than just the one who will win the loot.
---
Alternatively, what do you think about a regular DKP system where if no one wants to spend DKP on an item despite it being an upgrade, the people who could use it roll on it, thus not wasting the upgrade on a disenchant?
---
Viper Sting!
---
I was hoping you'd be logically consistent, instead you say:
---
&gt; Itemization has to be considered when going through the content timeline stages. This would provide incentive for players to go back and rerun dungeons to get items in future "patch" stages.
---
That's the biggest hypocrisy. If you were *really* all about historical accuracy you'd want 1.12 as 1.12 really was. A patch that only existed for three months before TBC. There was no progressive itemization over those three months of 1.12.
---
So much for what could have been a consistent opinion.
---
I mean, I kind of mentioned my reasons for such a system, though I admit it seems unnecessarily complex.
---
One big problem I have for ele is that max rank lightning bolt is wayyyy weaker than the max rank nukes for mages and warlocks. Not only that, but the Elemental Shaman would benefit so much from a *Mage* talent called Master of the Elements. Ele has so much natural crit built into it through talents that getting mana back on each crit would be great. 
---
I think ele has a great niche and is a good spec in BC but is kinda garbo in vanilla. 
---
Progressive servers or seasons / ladders get boring really quick.  
---
I personally wish they add new content to vanilla, fill up all the zones that were inaccessible, take the best parts of future expansion and leave the bad parts. 
---
I agree, TBC alone had a lot of bad decissions already.
---
Typically, Shaman tier sets are a lot weaker than off-set generic healing gear. Earthfury set in MC is good, but you'll soon be able to start replacing parts of it with ZG/BWL gear. 
---
all i know is botting is just that, botting, and they arn't using sophisticated hardware, an AI can easily differentiate between a bot and a real person whether you are using it to detect something at a super low cost
---
Right? I'd actually play alliance on a BC private server if there were dwarf shamans. I just can't play draenei shamans. 
---
He literally said he doesnt want to go in TBC, his post is 2 lines, people have the smallest attention span nowdays lol.
---
Is there anything else worth fishing for?
---
Alchemy is a great way to make money. Unlike the armor/weapon-crafting jobs, the alchemy products are consumable, so people need to keep buying more throughout the lifetime of the game. This keeps the price steady relative to inflation, so you won't fall behind the rest of the market.
---
I have actually found that herbalism is not necessary. For me, it is more time-money efficient to simply purchase herbs from the auction house and then immediately resell the potions. Also, you never have to leave the city, which saves time. Any time spent traveling or gathering herbs could have been spent crafting and selling potions instead. Of course, this only makes sense after you're level 60.
---
If you enjoy farming in the world rather than just sitting on the auction house, it's much more efficient to take two gathering professions such as herbalism and mining. Time spent farming will yield roughly double the production. Depending on your class, you can also solo-farm ZG, DM or other instances that have both kinds of nodes.
---
This is actually important because due to inflation, you will be "competing" against people who are farming with both professions. If some other guy is making 100g per day farming herbs and mining at the same time, and you're only making 50g because you only have herbalism, inflation could make it hard for you to purchase everything you need.
---
The notion of having herbalism and alchemy is fun, but it's not necessarily the best idea. Once you account for the cost of goods used to craft the potions and the opportunity cost of not selling the herbs you craft with, there's little reason to gather and craft with the same herbs. You can just buy herbs if crafting potions is profitable. The auction house fees actually pale in comparison to the return-on-investment for most potions, which is 50%-100% on current p. servers.
---
Its very difficult to have to many shamans
---
I hope all of you are ready for the amount of hunters that going to be raping your asses while leveling . Probably 80% of the population that has expirience in classis is going to be leveling one to farm gold
---
Yeah, between finding a group and everyone getting to the entrance and then fighting your way through the pre-dungeon trash, it usually takes around 2+ hours for most dungeons. 
---
The harsh reality is: Expect to have to leave before the dungeon is over most of the time if you really can only play in three hours chunks.
---
You dont seem that bright your self
---
Kind of what I was figuring. Possible to have up to 8 shamans in raid. I also love healing and would def be resto. Could only assume guilds and pugs would love to have you
---
nothing you get on horde will compete with having paladins in your faction
---
Define "deep elemental". 30 sounds pretty deep to me :)
---
I dont think its worth it, its a soulless experience, either you have to level up from 85, wich is not worth it, or use the free character level up thingie but thats as soulless as it gets.
---
&gt;how many times do you see someone roll 100?
---
1 time out of every hundred rolls...?
---
&gt;the fault of DKP was that it made people hold off on "buying" good upgrades because they were saving up for the BEST upgrade, resulting in good gear being disenchanted because no one wants to spend DKP on it
---
solved by:
---
&gt;Alternatively, what do you think about a regular DKP system where if no one wants to spend DKP on an item despite it being an upgrade, the people who could use it roll on it, thus not wasting the upgrade on a disenchant?
---
I think that's fine. If nobody wants to spend DKP, everyone should be able to greed roll for it. Spend your DKP or have a 1/40 chance at the loot - seems more fair.
---
just youtube Serenity Now, you'll get it
---
If I am going to be staring at an ass every time I play it’s going to be a female’s ass, not a dude’s. Thank you. 
---
they need Danny DeVito to do a commercial, playing a dwarf.
---
Ah that makes sense. Thank you!
---
50g is a very very very small amount for people that know how to get stacked up on gold &amp; mats early on .
---
I can sustain myself respecing daily .Not saying that its the best place to spend your gold tho , especially for newcomers or returning veterans that will have it hard when it comes to resource managment
---
You can tell it’s legit because of the almost even class comp lol
---
People still talk like this even when classic wow is comming in the next 6 months. 
---
I always found it mildly disappointing that the Execution is a tiny 'pew pew fire blip' rather than that BIG A\*\* hammer coming down on Executus.
---
You fuck off retail boy. You apes couldn't stop the vanilla train now you infiltrate the vanilla community and try to change it from within. I see ur plan retailboi.
---
Youre such a special snowflake asking for everyone to cater to your dumbass.
---
I also decided on a mage. I was going to go Enchant/Tailor but decided to swap to Tailor/skinner. Skinner will help with the early gold needed for level 40 mount. It I can be dropped at a later time for something else. 
---
Sounds like you are a retail casual who is used to getting insane gear though luck and now you fear eating dirt and getting left behind by the players that actually put the effort in.
---
Honestly can't think of any other reasoning for why someone would want to introduce so much RNG into a supposedly fair loot distribution system.
---
And FYI you won't find a single hardcore or somewhat competitive raid that is fine with this system to help casuals.
---
Was expecting 170 ''GZ'' comments
---
Lol just because you're an idiot doesn't mean anyone here plays retail lmfao?
---
Lmao Im not even playing on retail you fucking spoon and Im not advocating for any changes 
---
Please show me those results because I'd love to see some feral druids kick face!
---
the low naxx participation had alot to do with tbc coming shortly after and the knowledge that your gear was getting replaced with greens, my guild didn't even bother, everybody began stockpiling gold for mounts and enchants for the expac
---
I'll preface this by saying I've only stopped healing a player twice in dungeons. Both instances were the last fight of a dungeon and completed a run without a wipe.
---
Both situations followed the same pattern:
---
*Tank was a bit undergeared, but functionally fine and viable to complete the dungeon.
---
*Rogue was totally unable to avoid taking a lot of damage on boss fights.
---
*Rogue wasn't outputting much damage.
---
*Fight was obviously going to take longer that my mana would last if I continued to heal the rogue.
---
If both situations I had to perform triage and cut bait on the rogue, otherwise I would have run oom with the boss at 20% health and everyone would have died. It's not a technique I eagerly sought out to employ, or something I did out of spite, but it is something I am prepared to do in order to increase the chances of the group succeeding as a whole.
---
pick your poison. 
---
You already laid out the pros and cons by yourself, hard to make that decision for you.
---
And - as we all know- the true master profession is engineering anyway! #LilSmokeyIsNotARapper
---
Winter squid in the winter, firefin after aq releases, nightfin, stonescale eels, and probably a few others I'm forgetting
---
In the time it takes to level a farm character you could have dungeon farmed and have epic mount and max professions
---
Yep this is the best way to do it. Also reveals just how low the profit really is. IMO it's not even worth doing at a price of 1.2g per stack considering the time it takes to buy out the leather, get it out of mail, run over to a vendor that sells thread, etc. And that's if the person is willing/able to stay at computer to keep their character from logging out for so little gold per hour.
---
Oh, I missed the context. Yeah I can't see that being to efficient 
---
&gt;&gt;“I like to look at a virtual chicks ass, not a virtual male ass!”  
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Well to me that is just a bad joke. If people honestly think like that, or make decisions based on that, then it sound rather primitive lol. There's 1000 things to be aware of in game, and what you apparently can't stop staring at is the arse of your virtual character? I have a difficult time believing that, whence it is just a bad joke.  
---
You've obviously never played vanilla then. 
---
You spend hours just running around with nothing to do but stare at your characters arse. 
---
&gt;people hold off on "buying" good upgrades because they were saving up for the BEST upgrade, ...  and resulting in an inflation of DKP and the person with most DKP being GUARANTEED the item despite the fact that the person with the second highest DKP also put in a LOT of effort but did not have a chance against the MOST hardcore player. 
---
And what exactly is the fault here? If you have the most DKP you are guaranteed the item you want sounds only fair. Just like when people safe up for a new car. Sure they have enough money to buy a cheap car, but what'S stopping them from saving more money to buy their dream car?
---
&gt;resulting in good gear being disenchanted
---
This basically never happens. If you are progressing then someone will end up taking it. There is no way a great item gets disenchatend during progress raiding and if the boss is on farm status some alt gets it or people roll greed.
---
Loot council with transparency &gt; all.
---
I distinctly remember being in AB when this episode was on, guarding the lumber mill and when Cartman crapped all over his mom I hit a lag spike and my FPS dropped to like, .5, and when my computer finally caught up my every.single.one of the chat channels I was in was filled with "lol," "rolf/rolfcopter" or some variation of those. 
---
Your system sets up scenarios in which players who did not win the item have still lost something. It's not even zero-sum. It's negative sum. 
---
DKP works because it's an auction. The player with the most to spend and the highest willingness to spend their earned DKP wins the item. Anyone who bids and loses retains their bid DKP. Did they lose the item? Yes, but on the flip side they've just moved up the DKP list. It's cold cruel economics, but it has a certain sense of fairness in that you work to earn DKP and you decide what to spend and when to spend it. 
---
I’ve never raided with DKP before so I don’t have much say in the matter and this is just my subjective opinion, but I agree with u/HendersonStonewall and think that adding the RNG element would take away the need for DKP, or it will at least make it a broken system.
---
My reasoning is that imagine one of the hardcore raiders has saved up the most DKP in the raid group and an item drops that he/she’s been waiting on for long a while, then the hardcore raider spends most of his/her DKP on extra rolls. There’s still a chance that a casual raider could roll a 100 on a single roll and the hardcore raider could still roll less than 100 on all of his purchased rolls. Then all that DKP is wasted and and he’s now in the same boat as the casual raiders with barely any DKP or item to show for it. That wouldn’t be fair in my opinion. 
---
Also regarding “how many times do you see someone roll 100?” - I think it happens quite a lot, that’s the beauty of RNG. It’s happened to me many times where I’ve rolled a 99 thinking I can’t possibly be beaten and then someone else rolls a 100.
---
I don’t think it’s a bad system but I wouldn’t want to be a part of it because of my reasoning above, that being said nothing is stopping you from making your own guild and using your system! I’m sure you’ll find like-minded people that would love a system like this and then you can raid together.
---
Yeah right now i'm resto, but occasionally i'll offtank BWL. It's not really a problem with good healers. Bears generate more threat than warriors, also have more health and armor. BWL is more about mechanics anyway, and having the Onyxia Scale Cloak and Free Action Potions ready.
---
None that I know of but I do have a guild full of people I played with from Wrath through WoD (when I quit) and used to be super close with. Need to see if they are playing Classic.
---
No argument there, some people around here just get very touchy about ANYTHING from wrath coming anywhere near vanilla.
---
But I think the culture of WoW has changed so much since those days that that other 95% of players will mostly end up looking up guides or using the Classic Wowhead database.
---
See the winter squid is an interesting case here. How many people know it's tied to a certain time period? Do they just hoard it and then slowly release the stock into the market over the summer? 
---
I think PvP knowledge and knowledge about the economy and farming what's valuable will be the most glaring differences.
---
Concentration of "goblins" would be a factor to consider though
---
Man ironbark is such a sweet staff from AB. High armor priest here we go!
---
&gt;  disagree, gouging a blink was a real thing in vanilla and was a big deal in rogue vs mage matchups
---
Yea this is how I would always beat mages, frost ones in particular. 
---
I remember specifically a time right after I got a casting bar mod (that showed the cast time of enemy players, but it also included things like, cool down count down and when a temp buff, like Ice Block, was going to expire) I was fighting a frost mage at the Farms in AB, I got the jump on him and after a short scuffle he ice blocked, I just stood in front of him and as soon as the casting bar depleted I hit my gouge hot key and he blinked, sure enough, he was standing there gouged a few yards away, so I just walked up to him and Kidney shotted when the gouge was up, back stabbed, dead. 
---
Vanilla PvP is very different though. This goes for /u/skribsbb as well. Mana drains are pretty situational, especially for Warlock. You're undoubtedly going to be pissing a lot of people off by going the drain route, and at least for a sadistic person like me that has plus value, but often times the easier and safer route is to just go straight for the kill. After all, you need to actually survive until the enemy is drained, and that's a lot harder in vanilla than it was in TBC. I'd even argue that it's less useful in team fights than 1v1.
---
Mind you, they're still very strong spells. They play a key role in many of the 1v1 Hunter/Disc Priest matchups, and in team fights where both teams are equally matched and backed by healers they can easily decide the fight. But if the fight isn't an exact XvX where both teams have a healer... they're just not ideal. If you're in a 3v2 you can just kill people instead. If you're in a 3v4 you need to quickly kill someone to equalise the match up. World PvP/BG's just aren't comparable to arena conditions.
---
No you said it was a must in TBC. 
---
Mom! Toilet! “Proceeds to poop on mom” “That’s a good boy” 🤮
---
A loot council is more utilitarian than DKP and is built on a sense of fairness with a communal bend. Who deserves the gear? How will it benefit the player? How will it benefit the core raid team? These are some of the questions that a (good) council will consider. 
---
I'd say it's superior in a structured guild with good leadership and a mature team. 
---
yep that last bit is what always made me mad as shaman. sure when you get a wf crit off it feels great, but most of the time you are not touching anyone squishy. And salt to the wound, you even have your ghost wolf (with cast time btw), but then you look at the instant shapeshifting druids that also removes snares... Fuck i was so pissed because of druids when i played shaman...
---
That’s fair, there’s no single right answer. Engineering is a blast although I view it as mainly a luxury for pvp. Definitely making an alt with engineering!
---
From my research you can use as little as a dozen a week and even less when something is on farm. 12 only takes an hour of farm. You also can be versatile as a standby tank/OT
---
Who sounds like they were even born when vanilla was out.
---
For the love of god, punctuation.
---
Some do. The best time is right before a raid releases in the summer 
---
&gt;This basically never happens. If you are progressing then someone will end up taking it. There is no way a great item gets disenchatend during progress raiding and if the boss is on farm status some alt gets it or people roll greed.
---
Thank you - I am not well versed in vanilla raiding and did not know that was not the case
---
Assuming a raider,
---
You will have a guild alchemist or two. Unless you want to have that position, there is no point in you taking alchemy. The guild alchemist(s) will get funneled all the good recipes and you may not have them. They will make your potions for you from mats for free, or if your guild is really serious they will just give you potions because you're a reliable raider.
---
The exact same argument applies for Enchanting. The only good your enchanting will do you is let you DE gear from levelcap dungeons for mats. Not worth.
---
Herbalism is a great moneymaker. 
---
Tailoring is an okay choice for a mage because of Bloodvine, Gloves of Spellpower, Dreamweave Circlet etc... which are all useful at various points.
---
If you're quite serious about raiding then you will want engineering for AQ if not before. Ideally you have it even for MC.
---
I suggest Herb/Tailor until you have made enough money to last you through AQ consumables, then Engineering/Tailor.
---
Alexensual approves.
---
Ghost wolf not being instant cast.  
---
The sheer amount of keybinds.  
---
Recasting weapon buffs and lightning shield. 
---
   
---
That's about it for me, maybe I should stick to good old priest
---
I have another less complex, easier to maintain and maybe even more fair idea: 
---
People have to install https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/project-2717/files Texas holdem poker addon, then the ones who are interested in certain item would bet DKP and play. The one who wins gets the item. EZ. 
---
I wonder if people would be opposed to "pally plate" not showing up in horde loot table. I can only imagine the frustration of getting it every week
---
No I said the opposite lol learn to read
---
cater to my ass? I am saying everyone needs to cater to VANILLA itself idiot, you must be room temperature IQ. 
---
i played vanilla idiot c ya
---
sure u aren't i bet u dont want spell batching and u want loot trade 
---
You're right - I didn't consider the fact that someone could save up a LOT of DKP, spend it all on one item, lose, and in the end have no item AND no DKP - and this is HIGHLY likely to happen if one person has 1200 DKP and another has 1100 DKP. Even if one of them wins, the other one just lost 1,000+ DKP and nothing to show for it. I think this alone makes it a bad system.
---
I suppose DKP works - I just always felt that a drop should give everyone a chance to get it, no matter how small a chance and how casual a player.
---
Don't forget you can't track herbs and ore at the same time in vanilla, so unless you run addons that track node spawns (or you know a good route for both) it's harder for the average player to farm both.
---
I want you to fuck off
---
Removed. Please post these in our lfg thread appearing on Mondays. 
---
I personally didn’t like this idea 10+ years ago, but I love the idea of a big orc rogue now.
---
Yes - I agree, this completely kills the system, I didn't consider that - 2 people with lots of DKP may well end up with one of them winning the item, but one of them will STILL lose all their DKP and have nothing. 
---
Sounds like you are just a riot to hang out with
---
I saw a great return on it when I was grinding 40-50 in Feralas (Horde) since almost everything in that zone is skinnable and drops Thick (and later some Rugged). Set hearth to to Mojache and everything is right there including the recipe!
---
Outside of that I couldn't imagine buying the leather to do it. 
---
All thats nice. That being said, I have always been of the opinion my allies not being sheep. Is the biggest damage boost of all. lol Pally&gt;Priest&gt;Shammy&gt;Druid. Dispelling CC is just too strong. Especially when you consider that crap lasts 45 seconds and diminishing returns haven't been ramped up like in BC.
---
Best raid holdup I can remember - waiting to go into Ony and someone started fapping with a hot mic on Vent
---
We all tabbed out to see who I was but they had stopped transmitting. 
---
The fantom fapper held up an Ony raid. 
---
Absolutely
---
Enchant/tailor is more satisfying to level up as im leveling to me. I like getting new gear, enchants, and recipes to look forward to even if they arent gonna be used for long. Then there ate the benefits of the 300 skill items. However, it is more expensive and it will be harder yo level first aid along with it.
---
Herb/alch will be more useful, more profitable, and easier to level in the long run, but a bit less fun IMO. Potions are lackluster until you get pretty far in alchemy, and arent as satisfying to craft and use.
---
Unfortunately it sounds like he's waiting for full T2 to give himself a sense of importance and meaning he's unable to achieve outside Azeroth... 
---
I think we should just let trannies be trannies. 
---
Point taken XD
---
And you showed your 60 ding the other day too :)
---
I'd say 1-5% of private server players played Vanilla and perhaps 10-20% played Vanilla, BC or WotLK
---
I get it man, you want your safe space in the WoW of your childhood.
---
The Salty title didn't exist in BC
---
In general, most hybrid DPS just need Mana Regen. I do not see how that could break BGs much since people break combat and drink or just die. Make stormstrike a buff and enh would be fine. Ele just needs one Mana talent above ele mastery and good.
---
Druid and Shadow Priest.
---
Disgusting synergy.
---
Going to delete the character and start fresh, there is no fun in that
---
There's like 3 pieces total of plate healing gear that can even drop for horde, so not really a huge issue
---
Yeah but you didn't say level 60 till now lol... 
---
Yeah, I think most people would agree that Priest is the best/most versatile overall healer in PvP and Paladins are OP when put in a purely defensive role.
---
Shamans are built for aggressive play and they have to be really good at reading situations and managing their globals if they want to be effective.
---
U sound like a bot jesus
---
&gt; If you're quite serious about raiding then you will want engineering for AQ if not before. Ideally you have it even for MC.
---
Being an engineer and being serious about raiding aren't in any way related. You're not serious about raiding simply because you care about stuff that isn't necessary for progression. 
---
I miss everything about vanilla :( 
---
This is a terrible idea. The whole point of DKP is to award participation and take out RNG of rolls.  You can basically spend all of your DKP on one item buying rolls and still lose the item. 
---
IIRC the person who died was a major PvPer, so they would have probably liked the fact that their funeral became the most infamous funeral in all of online gaming.
---
lol, well I do want vanilla to be as close as possible to the real thing... however, I think you would have to have a screw loose to get mad over a commercial... especially one that was so awesome. I do like the persons suggestion of having Terry Crews do one.
---
Shamans are amazing. Way more fun then pally. Even if not quite as good. Who cares spend the next five minutes sheeping the pally as punishment lol. Thats the best part about classic. Everything is so OP no matter what you play as long as you get the gear. You can rain hell on people.
---
im the one with a safespace? LOL? You guys are wanting changes to suit ur own safe spaces I'm the one saying I want it as it fucking is nice and raw. 
---
ooo im so scared le ledditor is telling me bad word fuck off! omg! hahahaha why do u even comment retailboi go back to jacking off to ur belf transmog
---
There aren't any good ones. Sorry.
---
It works great with a good, cohesive guild. I want "badass mace" and it'll improve my healing by 10%. Dave is expected to keep showing up, and it'll give him a 20% boost. Dave get it. I'm happy for Dave cause that means, due to his better performance, we'll beat that next boss that drops the trinket that gives me a boost.
---
Does require a mature, more altruistic "the greater good" members, tho.
---
Not me. Us.
---
of course you are active in /r/braincels...
---
Rest assured I am a real person who just enjoys cooking and is not at all affiliated with that Chinese company that gave reddit a bunch of money. 
---
*(Two WoW Tokens have been deposited onto your account)*
---
I've been saying this for a while. Even on my vanilla pserver I joined a guild where the GM had never played wow before. She was playing vanilla for the first time. A lot of people in the guild had no idea what to do in raids. I took a lot of the rogues under my wing to try and help them out. I watched a hunter break his devilsaur set with a random blue that dropped in a dungeon. He then said those lists may not be accurate anyways so what he got must be better. You will know who the min/maxers are for sure. It will be a new experience for the majority I think.
---
Woah! I don't think I'd ever even thought about priest/lock combo. Especially once you get shadow weaving (as you said) that will be super nice. Plus healing void walker in a serious pinch - you basically have your own questing tank that doesn't steal exp. Ooh that's just a cool combo 👌 now I wanna roll priest and convince one of my friends to go warlock 😂
---
I hope your friends play! But either way playing with you wife will be super fun especially since she'll be experiencing it for the first time!
---
Way more fury warriors. Nobody knew how good fury PVE dps was until later in classic. We were all noobs and had 6 arms warriors in our raids.  Fury itemization was also very poor until late BWL and the release of craftable items like Lionheart and Titanic. 
---
Pretty sure 3 dagger rogues would just be unstoppable. 3 ambush and backstabs would kill anybody, then vanish and do it again on the second person. Then it's three on one.
---
&gt; 12 only takes an hour of farm
---
It has like a 40% drop rate and 5 lockouts per hour, so likely 30 runs for 12 drops, or 6 hours.
---
I did have one ret paladin in my guild on a pserver. He had a tank set so he could help offtank for certain bosses. His DPS wasn't anywhere near the top but I guess he earned his spot by helping out where it was needed which is important. 
---
I wonder what strats those are. The ones we used in my pserver were just like the ones we used in vanilla. I figure there must be some crazy strats but I never had an opportunity to use them. So its a legit question and not talking down to you, to be clear.
---
Best day of my life right here
---
Shaman: you mean to say that deep resto with elemental is not viable for PvE, or something else? My impression was that PvE is always deep resto, but secondary specs can be either or both.
---
Discipline/holy was kind of already implied, but now rephrased more explicitly.
---
I put deep balance to leveling because unless you're insanely skilled, it can't be put anywhere else, can it? Note that I said "ok", not "good".
---
I avoid too many specifics in hybrid builds, the intended purpose is a generalized overview of separate specs.
---
Ok man maybe its time to call off your social justice campaign to preserve your safety blanket and grow up.
---
Probably none of my friends are coming  back unfortunately. One was a naxx raider back in the day so he has the mindset of "been there done that." My cousin feels like he's just too lazy nowadays for the vanilla grind. I'm super hyped though 
---
No, it's documented at 60% via classicdb and by Shedo a popular feral druid who is helping show how the spec can work. 15 min for 5 runs, 3 pummelers on average. Log onto alt for the other 45min or do chores. You do not have to do more than 12-16 pummelers, you can also roll over on whatever you don't use. Not trying to argue just what I have researched.   
---
https://youtu.be/qWQ6ucy-QEk
---
There are strats for leaving starting zones and farming mobs to level up to avoid the rush of players in starting zones. I wonder how that will work. I do think a lot of pserver players will have a leg up on leveling though. The quests are the same even if the xp numbers are off. We will know where to go next without having to look it up or ask. We know where the hubs/FPs are. We already know where to get all the dungeon quests and what chains need to be done. I figure the pserver crowd will get a jump on most of the other new players (read haven't played vanilla or haven't since vanilla). 
---
I hope so. I'll be a rogue so the fewer rogues the better.
---
ooo le ledditor looks at my post history oooo lmao thats how i know i got u
---
I miss carrying the flag in WSG. So much fun. 
---
+To tank dungeons
---
Check!
---
+To melee DPS but want some ranged abilities
---
+To have one spec (no respeccing)
---
+To travel fast prior to lvl 40
---
+Savor my bag space
---
yeah... no. 
---
This is very true... Exp-wise 45 would make sense to be the halfway point? I think my friend playing warrior would cry if he didn't have one of us to supply him free food everytime he logged in. Especially if you're not tipping the mage (because we are all irl friends and don't need to tip each other for stuff) I bet the amount 5 people save on food/water through leveling is pretty substantial.
---
Oh shoot you're right, it is 40 for portals. I was thinking 30 but I was mixing up the 2nd tier teleport spells (TB for Horde, Darnassus for Alliance). Meh it will just make them appreciate the portals that much more at 40, right? 😅
---
Even though I played TBC when there were no QoL portals in major cities (still only from mages and also Shattrath) I feel like the beauty of mage portals is muddled by recent (brief) experience in Retail.
---
Maaan now you're convincing me to roll mage, again.
---
Esfand hosts ClassiCast, so his channel has that and other content. TipsOut has a variety of Classic series. Frostadamus is great for professions and goldmaking, as well as other guides. Defcamp &amp; Melderon have a wide variety of content from noob guides to talkshows. Raserisk and Docken have raid guides and streams/stream highlights. Docken streams pretty regularly with different raids and whatnot. Kargoz has a lot of speed leveling content, as well as, more recently, PvP workshops with top PvPers. SoupaSoka has a variety, as well. PhilpseyForce has some pretty thorough dungeon guides. Icosiol and Alkemical have several different guides, as well. And if you're looking for lore, he's not specific to Classic but Nobbel87 is your guy. Also not specific to Classic, but MadSeasonShow has several ongoing Classic-related series. I'm sure I forgot some good ones, and I apologize.
---
Implying powershifting wasn't done in retail Vanilla and BC LULW
---
Could you elaborate a little bit on that? I don’t think you know what you’re talking about. Engineering gives you a noticeable boost in both PvP and PvE. 
---
That's pretty much precisely what I described (except I skipped over deep frost for PvP, as I heard that many people don't like this playstyle, now fixed). I intentionally avoided too many details and more uncommon builds. The exact point-to-poin builds is not what I wanted to list here.
---
\&gt; Quests. The most simple thing. A shitton of quest got added during Vanilla. While on private servers they exist from day 1. There simply were far from enough quests in Vanilla from day 1. XP and rep rewards on private servers are also completely wrong.   
---
No. They get added as they were added in Vanilla, at least on the private server I am on. Silithus was dead for the first few patches of the server, with no quests available. XP and rep rewards are kind of a really minor thing tbh.  
---
The only thing they didn't really roll out "a la vanilla" is the class talent and balance changes. Meh. I don't think having broken classes get fixed half way through Classic is necessary to make an authentic experience.
---
I never played end-game in vanilla but I was a lvl 57 Druid as of the 1.12 patch, had average gear and dominated in PvP easily winning 1v1 against lvl 59’s that also had average gear. Frequently topped the charts but that was mostly due to bleed DoT ticks. I think if you learn the class well you’ll put up a good fight for any class, priests are pretty tough though. I don’t think being a WSG flag carrier is necessarily a bad thing, the more you do it better you’ll work yourself out of tight situations which will also apply in other PvP situations (being super slippery like the above poster mentioned). Also it’s super satisfying defending the flag in bear form and still having a good chance of winning - don’t underestimate bear form and incorporate it into your PvP rotation for maximal damage output!
---
That being said I don’t know what the PvP was like at 60 but do remember seeing a few highly ranked feral Druids on my server. 
---
Keep in mind there is no Mangle spell in vanilla, so you will be frequently moving behind your target to Shred. I found that aspect fun and challenging though which is why I’m going to play a Druid again for classic!
---
Frostadamus has the best in my opinion.
---
Tipsout makes some good ones too.
---
&gt;You're not serious about raiding simply because you care about stuff that isn't necessary for progression.
---
I already answered your fucking question
---
its always u drones who steal words and use the opposite meaning for them
---
I've never understood why people care about "identifying" with their character. 
---
I just pick whatever looks cool, I actually did a race/sex change when I used to play wow just for different animations.
---
I sure as hell don't "identify" as an orc female though. Im a 32 year old dude lol 
---
I can agree with that. I played vanilla and was among the players on my server who did. You could tell who knew what they were doing and who didn't. I had to take a break for work and when I came by my guild was gone. I joined a random guild that happened to raid on my days off. The GM had never played WoW much less Vanilla before that pserver. I think her husband had played wow but not vanilla. A lot of people in the guild had said they started after vanilla. There were like 3 of us who had played back then. I had been on server first kills with my previous guild so I outgeared them massively. They were just starting MC when Naxx was about a month out. I watched a hunter break his devilsaur set over a blue leggings piece he thought was better. He said that those lists might not be right and we have no way of knowing if they really were or not. Other guild mates agreed with him. Not wanting to ruin their experience I kept quiet. To be fair, I am always willing to help those who ask. They seemed to want to figure it out on their own so I let them. I talked to the GM and her Raid lead husband about raid strats and whatnot and we agreed that we would run the raids and if we were having trouble I would give them some advice... I liked this because I didn't want to wipe over and over because they didn't know what to do.   
---
I firmly believe pserver players will be in the minority. It will be obvious who knows what they are doing and who doesn't. People can look up guides and all that or ask experienced players. People act like it will be impossible but as that guild I was in on a pserver shows... if they have their own guilds classic will be an enitrely new experience for some people. They even went out of their way to get the D0 set in some cases. I know none of D0 is pre bis for rogues. I'm pretty sure its the same for several other classes.
---
&gt;For those asking for post-Naxxramas content, you need to keep in mind this isn't OG Blizzard who created WC3 + Vanilla &amp; TBC.
---
Don't lump BC with WC3 or Vanilla.. BC improved on very little and introduced a lot of awful systems.
---
That assumes we all play on pvp servers.
---
&gt;A person who has never played Vanilla should get an extremely close replication of how the game was when playing Classic.
---
&gt;The content release timeline should be raised from 4 to around 8 stages with longer time frames at each stage.
---
Why make an entire post essentially saying "1.1 - 1.12" without actually saying 1.1 - 1.12? 
---
Now you just have to hunt down the  banana bread recipe from the Arcanum manual.
---
It doesn't matter how often you tell them this unfortunately... 
---
Definitely not. I remember literally being the only person in my guild who cared about rotations and optimal play for DPS during Vanilla. Now you can’t join a pug without every DPS being obsessed with his or her parse.
---
The expectations of the player-base is going to change across the board.
---
What a boss for having a full separate DPS gear set at level 20
---
In my guild in Vanilla there was a guy who was a warrior who had the skullflame shield. He loved that shield. He was a great player and always helped everyone out. One day he logs in but it wasn't him. It turned out he had some sort of issue like the kid in this article. He couldn't walk irl and so he played WoW where he could walk and run and do everything just like everyone else. It was his mom telling us he had passed away.  I believe a wreath was sent from the guild to the funeral. We had an in game funeral for him at the Cathedral in SW. The vanilla community was very close due to server sizes. When someone died sometimes it meant alot for both factions. Obviously we all know about the serenity now video. Vanilla brought us together. My guild even bought a skullflame shield to put on our main tank during the funeral as a tribute to him. I miss the good old days. 
---
To be fair, this isn't *my* toon, but an old guildie's from back in the day.
---
Assuming they base it on the 1.12 patch, It wont actually be possible (if you consider the boss chaining they introduced later into vanilla to be a bug fix or not)
---
Amazing.
---
Yea well written. It feels like each piece of gear is additive to the mission vs. people fighting over loot
---
But it's literally supply and demand 101.
---
Yes, people knows A TON more now than they did before. We know exactly what to farm for the best gold/h, but at the same time there will be more people doing the late-game content for every patch because people are not as limited anymore.. all the way from a majority now having stable internet connections and good enough computers to people being able to easily learn a raid through guides and aswell as addons to help warn about stuff, DBM as an example.
---
There were not many people that actually raided actively in vanilla WoW throughout its period, but that will be completely different in classic WoW which will increase the demand for pots and what not. So the increase in supply will equalize with the demand as it always does. There's no point in worrying about that if you ask me.
---
But on the topic of AQ and knowing stuff beforehand which leads to people stacking up on items that is needed when the patch hits, yes that will be huge and can't be avoided. The good news is that a majority are still too lazy(or simply doesn't care) to actually farm for stuff if it can't provide instant profits though, but the ones that do will earn a lot.
---
Im using them how u use them. Sorry your cognitive dissonance is bothering you.
---
I have played mage for the since beta, many many mages, I have had engineering ONCE and realized it was a huge gold sink for next to no benefit unless you are interested in ranking in PVP.  If you are a PVE mage, even on a pvp server, would take enchanting or herbalism over engi.
---
I like it. Hope you will continue posting your other works ! :) What other zones do you have in mind ?
---
Yes it did. It included fishing in pools south of Shat for the Magical Crawdad.
---
Yeah I think Shaman is a bit more nuanced and harder to play well in PvP than Paladin. Not shitting on Pally players, it’s just a pretty straightforward playstyle.
---
Yeah I hit max level with 2 troll characters over the last year on a private server and sorta fine tuned my route. Tried playing alliance with a dwarf priest and got it to 50 but just didnt enjoy the alliance side of things. Went back and played another troll to the mid 30s to make sure I have a good route planned. If I'm taking my time I can hit 60 w/a lvl 40 mount and maxed cooking, fishing, first aid, skinning &amp; herbalism in about 8ish days /played. That's if I do dungeon quests etc. I plan to lvl a troll priest shadow/disc and only dungeon run when I absolutely need gear, or when I think it would be good for networking purposes. 
---
I like madseasonshow, he makes varied videos that are very relaxing as he talks in a monotone voice. I'm not so much for the hyper clickbait videos so his are pretty perfect for me
---
&gt; No. They get added as they were added in Vanilla, at least on the private server I am on. Silithus was dead for the first few patches of the server, with no quests available.
---
No Blizzard certainly won't do that and whatever your private server does is irrelevant.
---
&gt; XP and rep rewards are kind of a really minor thing tbh.
---
They aren't minor at all. You can reach exalted by another faction at level 40. That was not possible during Vanilla.
---
&gt;The only thing they didn't really roll out "a la vanilla" is the class talent and balance changes.
---
And item changes.
---
&gt;Meh. I don't think having broken classes get fixed half way through Classic is necessary to make an authentic experience.
---
Item changes aswell and it is necessary when talking about a REPLICATION of classic.
---
&gt; 1 shoting req a lot of set up
---
Hmmmmmm
---
Ok, makes sense. Did you bind shift-G for example or you other letters?
---
They easier reachable.
---
It was added in WotLK. Move on.
---
My personal experience if tailor enchanter is great if you plan to run lots of instances/raids.  You can make a steady income off enchants and mana/wizard oils. If you are a guild designated enchanter you can make serious coin, BUT you will be that guy spending an hour after every raid enchanting all the new drops.
---
Herbalism paired with tailoring is also excellent for money.  As well as dire maul farming you can also solo/duo farm ZG for herbs/coins/bijous and most importantly BLOODVINE.  Even if the instance is clear herbs will still respawn, meaning should someone want to come farm some trash at a non raid time you can go farm for hours.  A frost mage and ANY other player can kill about 65% of the mobs in there, and drop rates mean you will fill your bags with coins and bijous before you have to wait for the herbs and trash to respawn ;)
---
&gt; never tried bana bred 
---
Lucky. I wish I could go back to my first time. Remember to use cold butter. 
---
With that logic, how about we have all raids available at launch too? Thinking is hard.
---
Ha! I'm not worried, man. I just wanted to hear people's thoughts. Your point on tech and creativity is something I hadn't thought of before. 
---
As for raiding, yea you're right. I'd imagine that the "leveling" sector will be much smaller while raid consumables will be a vibrant and competitive market. 
---
Very nice!
---
Apparently it is hard. 
---
Let me help: You literally sell this post as the “ultimate say” in perserving gaming *history* like a timecapsule of unprecedented accuracy. 
---
And then you start to beg for changes. 
---
What a sham. 
---
This ain’t no time capsule. It’s your personal masturbation fantasy. 
---
1.12 had all raids available at launch. If you were really all about #nochanges preservation then that’s what you’d have the integrity to promote. 
---
The only friend I still have I met in BC. She started in vanilla but didn't hit max till BC. I was 60 and raided in Vanilla. I had a ton of friends I still remember today on the Scarlet Crusade server. I hope they play again with the same names they had back then. This is all assuming they give us the old server names again.
---
Private servers have the convenience of the AH being instant. We will probably be waiting an hour on purchase/sales. Which will slow down market manipulation significantly.
---
There is no vanilla ptr...
---
Do you even know what a ptr is? Are you busting stringing random words you've seen on here together?
---
By serious raider, I mean someone who goes beyond what is merely necessary for progression and into things that help progression occur more quickly. The best mage trash pack rotation includes sappers, and arcanite dragonlings are very nice for increasing fire mage DPS on AQ bosses because of the debuff they apply. You can progress without that level of commitment, but if you want to be the kind of raider who seeks every advantage then you will get engineering.
---
What I loved about Vanilla was, that if you were good at any role, you'd _recognise other people that were good at their role_.
---
That's how you made friends, groups, and later guilds. With the people that knew what they were doing. And we'd bond over comments like "ey man, u healed effen great there. much appreciated. ignore those idiots and stay awesome my bro ♥".
---
Shit that's just the loveliest thing to give or receive in any game, isn't it.
---
Oh are you pretending to be an idiot? Very cool!
---
This isn't intentional, we'll get that fixed. 
---
CaffeineInjected has been leveling as a Prot Paladin for the past month. He regularly uploads his sessions at least once a day, and they’re hours long. 
---
It’s been great to throw on in the background. 
---
Reaching exalted with another race is minor lmao. It lets you get a different mount , who cares? At least getting exalted with Darn pre 40 was 100% possible in Vanilla. Do you have any proof at all that this was impossible in Vanilla?
---
what about the actual feral dps weapons that came later, such as the one from green dragons? Are they useful at all?
---
I loved kiting Omen to Orgrimmar.
---
Og_Haptix makes some top notch PvP videos. Not a ton of content but the content he makes is fucking fantastic. He will also stream on Twitch.tv at Classic Launch. Best mage in North America
---
OG_Haptix AKA “Ohhgee” 
---
Writer of “Its All About the Journey”
---
Well I heard it was patch by the time of the release patch we are starting from...
---
Not intentional, we'll get that fixed. 
---
TipsOut makes some good videos but it’s mostly opinion BS to get content out. Also TipsOut doesn’t know a ton about vanilla, he was just a content creator who hopped on the hype train early and got an audience. He would get his shit rocked by any top-notch Vanilla PvPer. 
---
Yes but the detection range is pretty large, so you can toggle between them without missing much if any.
---
Kargoz if you want well explained in-depth guides. Madseasonshow if you want good guides AND nostalgia stories/tales from a guy who really raises in vanilla, and other summary videos like rare weapons and armor sets.
---
But they put in a zeppelin that travels between Org/TB after Vanilla, so the barrier in Cat doesn't affect low lvl characters. 
---
I'm talking about actually retail vanilla back when it actually came out not a private server in the last couple of years.
---
Not videos, but I really recommend [Countdown to Classic's podcast.](www.countdowntoclassic.com)
---
No you edited it after people pointed out that you said the wrong thing. 
---
Engineering is the only profession with items that require the profession, with a few exceptions in other profs, there really isn't any question about this one prof
---
I didn't even realize the auction house might not be instant. Last time I did a lot of alchemy on blizzard's server was Wrath, and I believe it was instant. Also, I'm not necessarily referring to market manipulation such as buying out and relisting the same items - just buying ingredients, making potions, and listing them.
---
Ah nice!
---
you've never had soft banana bread have you
---
I finally got on the Countdown to Classic bandwagon and it's amazing. I've gone through the first 13 episodes in the span of a few days.
---
It was simply the first head quest that came to my mind...
---
Besides, no mentioning of the mount? I must say, I am a bit dissapointed, as it would definitly a the bigger achievement for a level 20 char.   /s     ;-)
---
You are forgetting the part where they need to book air time on TV channels which can cost millions.  
---
Definitely not worth the investment as everyone know about WoW by now.  
---
You make a pretty good case against Alchemy and Enchanting. Leaning towards herb/tailoring now because it’s profitable and I can still craft and fully utilize bloodvine. Thanks for the input!
---
3 vs. 1 means the 1 is f'd doesn't matter.
---
2 vs. 1 means you're prolly gonna win unless you're fighting a rogue or a resto druid.
---
Big difference between having 1 drain and 3.  3 drains means a healer is really quickly incapacitated.
---
There are less flight paths and quest hubs, and you'll be surprised how many people finish their quests and aren't the level they expect to be and then wander around looking for more quests.
---
I'm ready for the blame.  
---
Just kidding I'm rolling warlock.
---
after I'm 'done' with Tirisfal, WPL is next! :)
---
You'll see a lot of the more "hard core" guilds requiring engineering for min maxing after aq comes out, even for mages. Especially if they compete for world bosses. Doesn't mean you're not serious about progression, but it does matter if you're serious about min max and speedruns. 
---
Madseasonshow legitimately is my favorite ASMR. I’m serious lol
---
No early +hit? No thank you. 
---
Tips out might not be the Vanilla Lexikon but he knows how to put our all nostalgia and the feel of the game and it’s Details into words. 
---
It's a great movie too
---
&gt; I still have the feeling that many people don't get this was primarily a real life issue, not some game meme. 
---
I think a lot of people understand the situation, they just don't side with people choosing to hold a funeral in a contested area, on a PvP server. You can be of the opinion the PvPers are scumbags, but honestly, who's the biggest idiot here; The people not wanting PvP, choosing a PvP server, in a PvP area, or the people actually PvP'ing in a PvP area? 
---
It's like showing up to a nut-kicking festival and complain about getting kicked in the nuts or crying about getting your car stereo stolen, because you didn't lock the doors. The people are fucking idiots, but when you invite them to do it, you can't act surprised or be unhappy about the situation. You knew exactly what you signed up for and I don't think a lot of people have a lot of sentiments for people being this stupid.
---
Alexensual -  bad person, good videos tho
---
Nice vid! Nice easy build for leveling and end game. I would personally make a few changes on the order some talents are picked but to each their own. I like improved searing pain for those two remaining points before ruin and I agree with ignoring amplified curse for leveling.
---
the fact the names annoy you means they are working as intended
---
imagine getting upset at words on a screen lmao
---
being "serious about raiding" also sometimes reffered to as "tryhards" or "min-maxer" choose engineering, because it gives ***a*** dmg boost.  
---
Of course engi is not necessary for progression, but no profession is. So that makes for a really crappy measuring bar, dont you think? So when /u/galivet mentioned it, he was most likely talking about people that want to squeeze every  last dps out of their char - and for **that** purpose engineering **is** necessary.
---
So when /u/xmarkish asked you to elaborate, you should have done so to clarify things instead of giving a snarly response. Now you look even more ike a person that does not seem to know his stuff.
---
I always wondered how important that is for casters (I’ve only leveled melee + priest). 
---
Does the value of this depend on how you’re leveling, or is it necessary for casters across the board? (For example, the +3% Hit for Paladins in the Protection tree is really good, but ultimately not worth getting if you’re only doing a Ret/Holy build.)
---
I feel like they used to be pretty good and to the point.  
---
These days it's more along the lines of "blizzardman bad"
---
But 6 months from now will be August, possibly no Classic by then.
---
&gt; Sorry, but that sounds to me like, "I can only heal when everything goes right."
---
There are mathematical limits, you know? We have a finite mana pool, and if the party takes too much damage that pool runs out. We have finite means to mitigate threat and if we heal too much the mobs will focus fire us. We have finite CC and kiting ability and enough aggro will kill us.
---
If the tank is ahead on AoE threat and I have mana for days and a rogue takes some damage peeling a stray mob off me, of course the rogue gets a heal.
---
If the tank has just started one of those Ulda eight-pulls and the ADHD rogue pulls aggro by DPSing without waiting for five goddamn seconds like we explicitly told them to, they can bandage for all I care.
---
As far as I am concerned a great healer knows when to let a DPS die.
---
&gt; Players who believe kicking people for making mistakes are... well, impatient and immature. There's no other way to put it. If a player is making mistakes, teach him. Lift him up. Don't beat him down, kick him out, and exclude him.
---
If you are willing to learn, I'll teach you all day.
---
If you're an ADHD kiddie who refuses to learn or cooperate and thinks they are entitled to heals, then you're getting kicked out and excluded until you learn to play with others.
---
Yo bro you hella salty. Workout this anger dude it’s not good for you.
---
...no.
---
An announcement of a release date? Sure!
---
The release of the game with no prior notification? No.
---
Tipsout. His videos are well made and I love his enthusiasm for classic.
---
Look up the content release schedule before classic drops. Farm reagents or mats that will be needed when patch hits. Farm a fuckton of them. Watch the price of said mats skyrocket when demand outstrips supply. Unload mats and make a KILLING. Not many people know about this besides private server players. 
---
A lot of people on this sub shit talk private servers constantly but can't give any examples to back it up.
---
That and fadeleaf were my bread and butter in the early days. Chuck a few stacks of each on the AH most nights before logging off and wake up to a few hundred gold (which was a significant amount back then).
---
&gt; Of course engi is not necessary for progression, but no profession is. So that makes for a really crappy measuring bar, dont you think?
---
??? Whoever said otherwise
---
Here's the clip for anyone looking:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1vF3-BsoxE
---
Perfect Stealth
---
Literally came across him today and binge-watched all his videos, super chill guy with lots of insight.
---
Honestly I like to play the female characters more cause I think it's hilarious when a female dwarve ruins your day or a female tauren.
---
Obscure race/class combos always
---
You know, I am actually excited for cooking recipes that require multiple ingredients! I am sure most folks saw the spices and milk and stuff as an unnecessary pain in the ass, but I thought it added verisimilitude.
---
He is misinformed and absolutely horrible at the game. Are you high?
---
Toughness is the armor boost talent?  That used to be 5 points of defence at launch.  I remember when shamans could reach defence cap, they just didn't have the armor that Druid, Paladin or Warrior could reach.  
---
With Stoneclaw totem, Rockbiter (with a fast weapon) and Earth Shock they had better options than a Paladin for threat/taunt.   You had to replace stoneskin with stoneclaw for your "Oh shit" taunt but once it was done you dropped stoneskin again for the damage reduction.   Mana conservation was a huge issue but that's why you had a passive threat generator (rockbiter) with a fast speed weapon.
---
No. I don't understand the beef people have with him. I've only watched his YouTube videos, what's he misinformed on?
---
Druid/shaman would be very smooth leveling. Easy to find groups at max level too.
---
Best to play a class you are interested in playing at 60 though.
---
The way better players use professions has changed a bit. You aren't sitting on 2 static professions all game. If you've got 2 in mind, might want to consider what you can flex to until later patches. 
---
ie. I'll go skinning for easy money to 60, Tailoring (caster)/Engi (must have) at 60. Drop Tailoring once I have everything from it (Robe of the Void/Archmage items) until ZG and re-level it. Maybe herb 'til then. 
---
Also disenchanting
---
Stay away from da voodoo, mon
---
I'm ganna start calling alliance players who role female that now.
---
&gt;open raid tab
---
&gt;20 warriors, 8 priests, 4 rogues, 4 mages, 1 druid, 1 hunter, 1 paladin/shaman, 1 warlock
---
this is the pinnacle of class design
---
Yeah I think after much consideration druid/Shaman is a good combo, will probably play a warlock as my alt as I think leveling will be easier as a solo warlock anyway
---
he's never played vanilla, never played a private server beyond lvl30. Started his youtube channel after classic announcement in the most  click whory way with the most shitty consensual content and attitude with the only purpose of generating money.
---
One thing to perhaps consider is respec costs. Assuming the average player in Classic is higher skilled and more interested in optimization than the average vanilla player, you could see a lot more people routinely respeccing two or three times a week for raiding, PvP, and farming. That's a big gold sink that could at least partially counteract the inflation described in the OP.
---
Gender seems to be a harder “barrier” for a lot of people, myself included.  I don’t care if other people choose whatever for whatever reason.  If you wanna stare at a virtual butt, go for it.  If you like the female animations better, go for it.
---
For me, I am a male and will play a character that represents me in the game in that same gender.  No I’m not an orc in real life, no I’m not a warlock in real life, but I am a dude and my character is analogous to me in my mind’s eye.
---
If I were to play a female character, I would feel like I was playing as someone else entirely.  Someone who is not representative of me.  There’s a real disconnect and I would have a hard time getting over it.  The immersion factor is pretty important for me even though I don’t RP.
---
There’s my 2 cents on it and I am glad people are hyped to be planning stuff out like this in advance!
---
Everything points to July 16th, but it might be later. We'll have to wait a bit anyways for it to matter. 
---
I think the vast majority of people coming back to this game have not played on private servers extensively. 75% will be people with no real idea what is min/max etc.
---
But with all the information available today anyone that wants to get to the next level so to say can do so very easily.
---
That’s just a numerical issue though, not “class design.” Warriors aren’t raiding Gods until good gear releases. 
---
If you're fighting anything your level or above then you'll see a noticable difference from the talents.  Maybe someone who maths can quantify it.
---
Depends on the boss. In WotLK I kites Anachranos to Org many times. 
---
Esports and, Streamers two things classic needs. Like it needs a gunshot to the head.
---
Agreed!  I love hearing people’s kind and interesting explanations on their perspective.
---
I hate it when it becomes a matter of getting overly defensive about your decision.
---
You do you, man/woman.
---
It is defined by how quickly your server kills the invasions. The exact number was never found.
---
Private servers do not roll out all changes like they happened on live servers. Back in the day they didn't just add endgame quests. They implemented simple quests to make leveling smoother since there weren't enough quests.
---
This is about Blizzard recreating classic and they won'tdo it either. OP is talking about a replication of the original experience and this won't happen with wow classic.
---
Free action potions are amazingly useful and valuable, so yes....*just* used for free action potions :)
---
Yup, who’s got their pvp trinkets equipped? Lol
---
So, play what you want and run to the other’s leveling zone.  Day 1 is going to be so congested that it’s more enjoyable to just do that.
---
This is, of course, my opinion because I may be doing this very thing on launch day.  That’s why it doesn’t matter what my SO and I pick since one of us (likely me) can just go to the other one during peak start time)
---
Point 1: I'm not stupid, you're stupid!
---
Point 2: Memes exist.
---
Point 3: Sorry not sorry.  
---
Are you actually surprised that no one takes you seriously?
---
I don't disagree with you.  On the other hand, though, how many people would've remembered the memorial if it had gone off as planned?  Friends and family, sure, but nobody else.  As it were, though, there are _still_ a bunch of random people talking about the person/the memorial/the battle, a decade and a half later.  People who likely never knew this person, or the people in this video.  Whether they intended it or not, the gankers kind of immortalized the deceased _and_ their memorial in gaming history.
---
To be a bit blunt, it went from being something forgettable to something legendary (for better or worse) in the WoW community.
---
