The irrelevance of your point keeps amping up. But I'll be sure to talk to that SM64 speed runner about their world first.
---
---
---
You can play when your room is clean and you've done your homework.
---
Work work!
---
Well shit my queue was 10047 but 297 minutes...
---
Is one of the things I think is better for the game. For the people who want keep on same server Ande for the people who want move on.
---
That seems like a strong reaction to someone not liking a genre of music, but to each his own.
---
It’s day 6.  Just play the fucking game and stop worrying about tryhards and streamers.
---
No, they were not ambiguous. Method was racing and Tips is just straight up lying.
---
\&gt; 2019
---

---
\&gt; still not realizing Asmonshit is a disgusting piece of shit.
---
I'm almost conditioned to avoid groups on live cause of all the assholes, while questing on classic me and my friend reluctantly grouped with two others for a quest and they turned out to be absolutely fantastic people and have played together since.
---
It's been such an integral part of the magic which made classic wow such a blast back in the day, that I'm amazed they've been so seemingly adamant to kill it off with most of the expansions and 'features'
---
Just use demo roar. Both this and shout are generating insane threat on classic.
---
&gt; you're handed gear at every opportunity
---
Didn't they even go as far as to make virtually every quest have a quest reward for every class? Or even at one point you didn't get to choose a quest reward the game gave you one matched to your class and spec? And was about to say that made things hard work to collect off specs but then didn't they also make it so gear changed stats e.g. dps to healer gear. God they really took out all the RPG from the RPG it's just an on rails questing game i guess.
---
Wow, I am honestly speechless. Fucking hilarious.
---
Just got 99% through and the healer leaves. Anyone want to run all the way to the end and complete none of your quests????
---
That dude is a sweetpie. He deserves everything.
---
It would be savage af. Just like the good ol times in blizz on 2005
---
Welp looked him and up and will check out some of his stuff, seemed to have a ton of recommendations. Cheers
---
Could never watch Asmongold. He is absolute garbage
---
Yes, Make Azeroth Great Again is a MAGA hat. The day you leave will be a good day.
---
Did I really click bait this or do you think I just didn't realize people knew about this and I just figured it out. Regardless take your misdirected anger and shove it dude.
---
"Rock things" LOL
---
even 10slot bags are only 30s now on my server. I don't know the price it takes to make them, but I don't think that's the goldmine it used to be.
---
I paid 1g for my 4 bags (4g in total) on Wednesday I think, lowered significantly
---
Shift clicking items searches them in the AH.
---
There's a pretty big overlap in the Venn diagram of "classic WoW players" and people who are deliberately obtuse.
---
The post says the private server guilds have to prove themselves in classic. Nobody has said shit about mythic raiding or whatever it is. Nobody cares. What it's about is people somehow believing that guilds like Method, who are all great players, would stand a chance clearing old raids vs guilds who have been speed running them for years. And they won't stand a chance clearing BWL, AQ or Naxx. That's what this entire topic is about, not mythic, not bfa and not who's the better players.
---
Nice.
---
Not really you can do all these in one giant sweep. Handing them in halfway through would be more of an annoyance than anything.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;It was clear the WoW devs had a completely different design philosophy starting with the later patches in WotLK. 
---
You mean right along the timeline with the Blizzard Activision merger and a lot of the old blood got canned?
---
Yep
---
#Alexwasright
---
I mean there are plenty of free private servers with a couple thousand players and it’s pretty sustainable.
---
Well I personally rolled druid in classic like I did in vanilla for the reasons that they are much more flexible, generally have better sustain at the lack of burst damage, and much more mobile and resistant to some CC. At lower levels they generate rage faster than warriors, and hold agro slightly better as well.
---
Warriors may be viable as tanks and dps, but not both at the flip of a switch. A feral druid in an instant can become your off tank, or throw a few heals if necessary and then go back to dps like nothing happened.
---
The 15 year old argument of why pick a druid when X does it better isnt an argument at all unless you narrow your focus to only the parts of the game that they dont excel in.
---
I think it’s Sticky Targeting in the combat settings in the interface options
---
For level 18?! No way my fury warrior would kill for that weapon.
---
Yeah that's what I did! Gonna log out a little later and start right up again
---
A lot can just be common sense or personal choice aswell, i'm not training new ranks of Fireball personally, when I run into frost-immune things I just make a new friend by tossing someone food and water and have them help me while I wand
---
[removed]
---
Thank you, gonna try this out tonight
---
I can respect that.  Just know it will be harder finding people wanting to install another app when they already have discord.  You could also use in game voice instead then.  You already agree to wow tos shouldn't be an issue then.
---
Triggered? Go back to T_D loser.
---
Hard to see but the mouse is just on the right in the Pic
---
Druid giving gifts of MotW
---
it's free publicity and helps the game even if it does turn others away who think they're too far behind. those people more than likely weren't sticking around for the long haul anyway though.
---
Something feels really off even in the lower level dungeons. We been doing some of them with 4 men.
---
This is what most people don't realize. They think they are going to Joanna/Madcow a the way to 60 as a priest or warrior, then get geared instantly. 
---
Without a solid guild, you can't play Vanilla as more than a cheap RPG. That's why things changed
---
I didn't realize that. It's been so long I forgot it was added in the ZG patch
---
Westfall took me three times longer than it would have if there was no one else around. I tried to get Old Murk-Eye eight times before I succeeded in tagging him first
---
So the best reasoning I can see is that players with the worse leveling classes, (warrior, rogue) aren't able to go to these groups. Meaning that warrior and rogue players feel EVEN worse than mage at leveling. As well doing this encourages people to boost levels harder. Having certain classes gain more exp and exclude classes. Another thing will be if people want to boost alts to do another mc run or something its better to have the entirety of this nerfed to its intended state.  
---
I personally dislike seeing so many raid farm groups cause that isn't in the spirit of how dungeons are supposed to be completed. Hence the addition of 5 zone ins per hour etc, they aren't meant to be hard grinds. But players will always find a bug to exploit, so the problem would still be there...
---
Im personally tired of all the posts suggesting retail babies which i suppose by definition i would be considered as trash people who would ruin the classic game.   
---
This discussion was showing that someone who enjoys retail is loving classic, and how i believe these two games can coexist and be enjoyed.
---
depends. If you try entering strat with everyone at lvl 21-22, you're definitely gonna need to cc on a few pulls and will need to spread out and so on.
---
If you do the dungeons at the level were every mob is yellow, yeah, probably won't need any real tactics.
---
Well folks this is exactly why a large number of people wanted to avoid the streamer server. Their celebrity causes people to give them significant advantage, even if it's not asked for.
---
As noted here there are plenty of good streamers out there, Defcamp, Melderon, madseason, kargoz, punkrat, towliee, etc.
---
A lot of steamers and content creators have good portions of their streams or videos. There are very few I have a large problem with, but Asmongold just has the most annoying persona on camera. It doesn't surprise me that he's stopped to this level.....again.
---
I’ll still me ruin it. As it’s a right for me to do. I’ll still report it as that’s also within my right. Weather the mods remove it or not is up to them.
---
I started playing wow after watching azmon, I agree, he is a big hypocrite XD
---
Haha I was just quoting the OPs exact whine in defense of beta males sarcastically. I wouldn’t waste the time defending beta males. Or whining about people not liking a version of a game I prefer.
---
***of Warcraft***
---
This was my thought too. I wonder if blizzard will introduce new classic like osrs did.
---
Each
---
Stalagg. Same for any original server though that guilds committed to.
---
Did this guy just...click??
---
Look up 2 min mage (requires a lot of gear to pull off though )
---
They will lose a ton of viewers who WANT to see them get wrecked. :/
---
I wonder if blizzard had that on their wall this whole time.
---
Asmongold literally has his own army. He has 4 guilds with over 1k people. Im sure they wouldnt mind being his bodyguards while he quests.
---
You should avoid tanking dungeons until you're well within the median range for it. You should aim to match or outgear your group always, or you're going to have a terrible time.
---
If you want to do the dungeon earlier, just join as DPS.
---
There are some threat meter addons out there
---
Staysafe is on the same PVP server and doesnt take gold donation. 
---
Not because of moral stances or anything, but because it takes away  the fun of the game for him. Also he leveled 95% in the open world duo leveling on quests.
---
I think its easy to see who is actually looking for vanilla GAMEPLAY experience. 
---
I don't think asmon really likes classic as a game, or looking forward for such things. Otherwise he would think and do the same. for him he doesnt look forward for such things, like enjoying getting through struggles and obstacles and getting things done by yourself.
---
As a mage? Very early. You're probably very close to that already. The orcs in Wetlands are a good spot (Angerfang Encampment)
---
Explain like I’m old as fuck: yeet
---
You're fucking garbage. Eat it.
---
the other day he's in a group doing quests and they come upon a chest. 4 roll and madseason wins, the 5th says pass. opens chest, 2 10 slot bags. wow! he INSISTS the 5th person rolls, and they win. he congratulates them and carries on. insta subbed!
---
I mean i can understand soda, he didnt want to stream classic at all and just wanted to play the game without streamsniping. He usualy just does his thing, doesnt beg for loot and doesnt make those big eventa where he ask people to come and help him.
---
Asmongold on the other had asked for it, he talks way to much shit, his presence distrupts the game and overall tickles some people in the wrong way. He got big criticising retail and praising vanilla and now wants to play vanilla like retail, and even for someone like me who never really waited for classic (im having fun lvling and engaging with community but its still not really my kind of game) he is simply obnoxious.
---
Is this a first in gaming? They are literally offering an entire expansion pack for free just for playing another version of the game.
---
Do dungeons underleveled with friends and you will maintain this experience.
---
What’s so bad about 25 man raids?
---
Shaman tanks work great at lower levels. They have solid threat generation early on.
---
Yeah I completely forgot about the whole layer part. Yeah the high pop servers will probably get queues.
---
Yes, it sucks if there's anyone else in the area. You can start around lvl 22-24 but really it only gets super good at 40 with barrier and mount. I think minimum is more like 5-6 mobs. 7-9 mob pulls are good, 10-12 mobs is when you're in turbo mode (there's really only a handful of places where you can do that though). Unless you're level 40 by now or are on a very quiet server I wouldn't go full aoe spec now. You can still pick up imp blizzard and do it every now and again, but you can't 100% level with it.
---
Ugh. This is sad. 
---
Just go fucking camping and play wow when you get back.
---
Yes it would. Back then they weren't shy about handing out bans. It being a mistake in their code doesnt matter. You know raiding isn't meant to be a viable form of grinding experience, and it should certainly not be offering as much xp as regular groups. 
---
Intentional misuse of bugs of broken mechanics should at the very least get everyone rolled back that used them.
---
That would be phasing, which retail has. It could be implemented in classic but #nochanged crew.
---
You can be a pom pyro fire mage and instant delete anyone pretty much every 3 min.  Still good between that cd also.
---
Yes, it's really killing BFA by funneling more subscription money into it
---
I didn't think of him highly what so ever but yes all streamers failed classic wow.
---
Class abilities may be lesser... lol
---
I didnt play BFA cause it stopped at Legion but tge abilitues were already toned down a lot.
---
Mixed with arcane you can one shot people.
---
Overall I'd say play what you like, especially while levelling. You can always switch back to frost if you don't like what fire offers you or when you want to raid. (molten core mobs have fire resist)
---
It's min/maxing for the low experience crowd. 
---
But also, these people ran dungeons to level and likely passed the best gear to the tanks and healers right away, because they were working as a unit. 
---
You don't need BiS as DPS until you get to DPS check fights like Rag - and even then you only need a few people who have it
---
We talked about retail WoW today in the guild I'm in on Classic, and only 2 people of the circa 25 talking about the subject played BFA. The others (including myself) quit somewhere along the way, or only play the first few weeks of a new expansion.

---
Yeah each QoL thing seemed great in isolation. But then several years later you look back and realise what made the game the game has been completely gutted.
---
For someone who watches his stream a lot, you may have forgotten: He said that he is probably going to make another character on another realm and play it off stream to regain that element of it. 
---
He also stated that because of the fact that he is a streamer, he has to play in a completely different dynamic. To avoid getting camped all stream, he has to be ahead of the curve. It’s not good content to keep getting farmed. He just wants to provide an entertaining experience for the majority. 
---
Yes, he will upset some people who want to play slow and savor the mystery of the game. But as popular as he is, he has to take the game as he is doing it. 
---
Sorry if this has been said before in the comments, i just didn’t feel like scrolling down to see if it has been. &lt;3
---
Or just don’t watch streamers and play the game yourself — the way you want it to be played.
---
If you can't see the relationship I don't know what to tell you. It's super obvious. Perhaps you could try rereading my messages. Maybe I should use fewer words?
---
Yeah I was really disappointed when someone recommended me it as a replacement when I was looking for MMOs. I don’t wanna sound like *that guy* but destiny PvE felt so... empty. PvP was nice though other than the obscene amount of pulse rifle only shit.
---
Its kind of nuts how many elements of games like The Witcher and Dark Souls I’m picking up on in this game now. If you play a warrior and engage with the gathering and crafting systems, there’s a very similar feeling to it.
---
Low, medium and high are relative to the other servers. It doesn't really tell you much about the actual population.
---
Who the fuck are these people who actually watch streamers.
---
Oh shut up......5 hour queues are not acceptable at all. They should be fixing this problem NOW. They should be implementing free transfers off high pop realms NOW. It's a DATA transfer. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.
---
Creating characters on a FULL realm that you do not already have a character on SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PERMITTED. This falls 100% on Blizzard for not figuring something out besides a FORUM POST 90% OF THE POP DOES NOT FUCKING READ.
---
Why should we care about how someone else play the game ?
---
Played for an hour or two in between activities. Calm your tits
---
I'm an experienced MMORPGs player and I never thought of this... Every other MMO I've played mana between fights isn't an issue so I've never thought of a way to deal with this. First time playing wow.
---
I've been asking tank to stop, but I guess unless they need me for dps race or utility I can just sit and drink in combat.
---
Do people run any graphics mods on Vanilla?  Is that a thing?
---
I was also killed by that one lol.  Saw it aggro and tried to sprint but he got a hit in and dazed me.
---
I ressed and watched him down some poor priest.  That guy is brutal.  I'm glad they kept him there though.  I remember getting killed by him in vanilla too
---
You will never find a guide suggesting mob grinding for leveling in classic. It is so much slower than questing its not even funny.
---
I think TBC Classic is being worked on, but they're not going to announce the plan until they have a better idea of how players are interacting with Classic. If Classic has really good staying power as vanilla, Blizzard will probably not want to mess with it.
---
TBC daily’s weren’t even bad, they were just rep grinds for mounts and gold makers. Nothing major.
---
Flying was only allowed in Outland, the world was still huge and Azeroth was still traversed on land mounts. People still hung out in IF or SW because of the auction house.
---
The old raids were still ran for fun, even in groups. And there weren’t expansions on expansions of old content that they got forgotten for others. And leveling was the same pace(maybe a bit sped up.)
---
And classes were more polished.
---
The hallway dungeons and the 25man raids I’ll give you though.
---
I tend to steer away from pet classes.
---
Nerds
---
I'm pretty sure soda stopped streaming because his leveling group didn't want him to stream. It's not like streamsniping was affecting him much inside dungeons.
---
TBC is very likely at this point imo. I wouldn't be surprised if it's announced at Blizzcon even.
---
Did you ever happen to find the addon?
---
What type of black magic are you using, assuming you're not bullshitting?
---
Who cares about streamers. Get this shit off the front page
---
The real irony is that the subscription is the same and that it will look by the numbers that both are doing well from a monetary stand point.  I wonder how many players are now re-subbing for the first time in years, I know I am.  It’s been a decade
---
It's the fastest way to cheese the classic experience..
---
Do I need to follow the beginning quest line or can I just kill sht
---
Okay so in 8 years Baine is gonna come warn you that Garrosh is gonna attack Theramore. You're gonna think about telling Varian and having the full force of the Alliance defend your city. Don't, just evacuate and ask the Kirin Tor to provide enough arcane projections/mirror images to make the Horde think the city is populated. Garrosh will drop a Mana Bomb, decimating the city, but you and your people will be safe.
---
Boom, Jaina doesn't go crazy, her apprentice and friends get to live, Archmage Rhonin will live to continue ruling Dalaran which means the Massacre of Dalaran won't happen, general of Stormwind will live, and now the blue dragonflight would know where the Focusing Iris is meaning Garrosh wouldn't have a second chance.
---
Boo this man!
---
Gahaha yes there’s a powerful story npc there and an alliance inn. I believe he’s a lv60 elite
---
I got the joke it was just bad and somewhat inaccurate. In the movie they knew it wasnt a parody but did it that way anyway.
---
I was able to put Battlenet and WoW classic with addons on a 16gb thumb drive and I move it between my pc and laptop it's amazing
---
No, they really don’t. Not only did many of these people create ways to efficiently do all of this to ease the process from private servers, but the information to do all of this is already available since, you know, Classic already happened. If we want to resort to ad hominem instead of discussion though, your post is like people who just blindly follow someone they assume is superior than them.
---
PS Stranglethorn Vale is a shitshow 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
...lol
---
Look at metatables, they are the sickest thing I've ever seen. Imagine a hash map that has built in event handlers. It's absurd.
---
Well if he's top of charts he's doing his job? Unless he was pulling aggro more than every now and then it was you guys that let him down?
---
What does "+ healing spells" do? I got a Magical Staff of healing or something along those lines and I can't find anything on Google about that enchantment.
---
Do every quest except think about the ones that make you go really far (across continents or into other zones)
---
1. We get it, Blizzard was wrong about something.
---
2. Constantly teasing them for it is stupid and unproductive.
---
3. You should be glad that they reversed their stance, not that they made it in the first place.
---
Companies make mistakes, Blizzard owned up to theirs and they did this right. Being an asshole doesn't exactly encourage people to continue to grow and reverse bad decisions.
---

Do you know what methods shroud and asmond and such used? Just questing?
---
I'm not a huge fan of the Disney like look they are going for with the newer art design. It works for Overwatch because it is an original IP without decades of art direction behind it. It feels less like the art team made their passion project and more like marketing breathing down their necks telling them to make it pop.
---
Mists of Pandaria was a goddamn masterpiece in art design though so there is that.
---
Who the hell cares if your first? First game in awhile that forces you to make alliances (not to pick a faction lol) in each server you play in. It’s amazing how much people are willing to group and quest in classic. Brings me back years! If everyone has the same attitude as Vanilla. Then this games gunna be relevant for a long time and not just another blizzard expansion fad.
---
except literally the only reason to bring a druid is to bring a boomkin for the 3% crit buff. other than that, druids are literally useless. Warrior tanks are the only viable raid tank. Tank and Ret palidins are borderline useless. Shamans are just as bad.
---
Its not a matter of x class being better than y class. i totally understand that will always be a thing that one class will always be lagging behind. The problem in Vanilla is that some classes/specs are literally not viable at all. Its not like retail where you can play the worst class and if your proficient at it, still be competitive in a raiding enviroment. In Vanilla you can be the best feral druid in the entire game but you still wont come close to being able to pull your own weight dps wise compared to the top classes.
---
I’m on Rattlegore and honestly there’s nothing short of alliance players wherever you go. Don’t think his statement is true
---
While I agree that paid transfers could solve this problem, If Blizzard is really going to introduce this as a solution to the problem they have caused themselves, then the last game time I bought is the last thing they ever get from me. They need to offer free transfers from full realms to low pop realms or they will see large drop in numbers.
---
It makes choosing a faction an important decision and creates server and player identity.
---
I didn't know who he was before this week, but he keeps popping up acting like an absolute dick all week long.
---
It's a branding thing. Method wants to be associated with the term, "World First Race." They had a falling out Red Bull as a sponsor because Red Bull basically wanted to take over the world first event (Method's statement, not mine). The race in Classic was just another opportunity to solidify Method's claim to the "World First Race." The event didn't need to be a success. They just need to keep using the name.
---
Madseason, Punkrat and WillE are amazing decent people for wow classic content, Asmongold is just a lowest common denominator ADHD fest.... can't stand watching him for 5 mins
---
very compelling argument
---
I think this is mainly down to just the level of optimization we take the game to now.  We've taken spreadsheet simulator so much further than back in the day.
---
Why care? Why does how someone else plays a game even matter to you? Just play the game yourself and have fun. Nothing else matters.
---
Hes a pampered trump supporting manchild, fuck you expect
---
No but that yankees jank shit is. (Disclaimer i dont like baseball in general and find it boring)
---
Because he is a streamer. They even get priority queue. 
---
Young people adore them. But as you get older you realise they're just people with issues who have been given a false sense of importance which highlights their immaturity at the expense of players and fans alike.

Lower is faster.  The speed is seconds between firing
---
Time to start a Lua vs [Squirrel](http://www.squirrel-lang.org/) war? (FWIW, Lua is so popular because it's easy to integrate into C or C++ code, and doesn't need many resources to run - great for games.)
---
Dunno about that, I think his stream was criticizing him because he already played off stream. Anyway, it seems stupid to setup a whole LAN room with extra cameras and shit if you're not gonna stream it all.
---
A weapon speed of 1.50 means that the weapon will attack once every 1.5 seconds. Higher attack speed numbers means slower weapons.
---
Long enough for my legs to fall asleep. When I went to stand up I fell over straight onto my face.
---
This post is not bashing Blizzard my friend
---
im looking for an addon that does the quest for me, is there something like this?
---
It’s not about who is first. It’s about the environment being created.
---
rockbiter is better, but if you're in a dungeon you'll want to windfury cause of threat    
---
You can launch another WoW client and log in, it should log you out of the previous client without kicking you out of the game.
---
Pulling, summoning, healthstone and soulstone mainly, and of course extra aoe dps.
---
I guess I’m just afraid to edit the wtf file haha I’ve never done that
---
Literally every server is plagued with people spamming SM to level. Streamers set the “meta” for the way people play the game
---
Unless wands are different, weapon speed simply means the time between attacks. So 3.6 speed means 3.6 seconds between swings. A higher number is a slower speed.
---
It's such a train wreck you can't look away, I got stuck watching an awful show with my housemate about pregnant rich trophy wifes, it was just so interesting figuring out how awful these people are. A good bonding experience was had by all.
---
Well, they do every two years, so, yeah. It’s time.
---
I thought this was a giant penis at first
---
You will eventually get killed by higher lvl players but it’s party of the process/game. Nothing that will make it impossible.
---
Speedrunning. Very Similar. Practically the same thing. Semantics of "World First" aren't relevent. You brought it up anyway.
---
Did that help? I can scale down the vocab, but I'll probably have to use more words again. Anxiously awaiting your feedback.
---
You can enable raid style party frames and set them to show HP.
---
Lol!
---
&gt;We thought more highly of you. 
---
Think that was your own fault there, bud.
---
Private server elite mobs hit much, much harder.  The SM mobs hit for 2.5 times harder on nostalrius than in classic for instance.
---
This forces players to converse with each other to utilize CC and obscure mechanics to proceed.
---
Oh this is a succulent template.
---
Eurothemist is failing classic wow.
---
You don’t understand how seriously these Dwarf roleplayers take their stuff. They go hard. And if they catch you mining tin in their territory without paying them money? You’ll be shamed out of existence.
---
It's only about 4.
---
Warlock as a whole is a very strong leveling class so it doesnt matter much what build you go for you will be fine. 
---
Affliction is a strong dps in dungeons but in raids you will not be able to put dots on bosses since there is a limit of 16 debuffs in classic so warlock raiding is mostly shadowbolt spamming and putting curse of shadows on things (and grinding soul shards before raid so you can give people healthstones)
---
Sometimes I can't tell if he's genuinely clueless or just playing it up. Certainly seems to work when he's reacting to the Jaina Warbringer clip on stream, going "Oh that's Thrall" whenever an orc appears, and then lapping up a torrent of "LUL THRALL 4HEAD LUL THATS GROM/REXXAR/DYLAN IDIOT"
---
Unlikely.
---
That's what I thought too
---
The AoE Definitive Editions are being rolled out as well!
---
If you think things are long and your only 16 lolm..........
---
Nah, it was finding people who knew how to raid. Barely anyone had raid experience in Vanilla WoW, you have to remember that. MC was tough.
---
Depending on the spell it will increase it’s healing by an amount. Usually the slower cast gain more from +healing but it’s pretty complex. Check out the relevant class discord and you’ll find some genius who figured the math out. Otherwise just think of it as a bonus to your heals!
---
&gt; maybe not the 10-man raid part(though I'm sure some people did)
---
It's currently a bug in classic, so no, people did not do this in vanilla. They are gaining an absurd amount of experience compared to what they should be getting in a raid group.
---
What's disappointing is that there are people like you who need to try and police how others play.
---
Asmon has specifically said he really enjoys grinding dungeons like this, and only wants to quest to try and change things up for his audience. 
---
Who are you to judge how others spend their time? He enjoys it, if you don't, then don't want. Stop being little bitches, my lord...
---
interesting, thanks!
---
not every class needs to do the same dmg. it would be nice however if every class was viable in some form. Druids for example outside boomkins, are terrible. Boomkins are even terrible as well. The only reason you will see one in a raid group is for their 3% crit buff to the raid team. Ret palidins are just as terrible. dps is awful. Tank palidins are too mana reliant and make awful tanks. Not all classes have to be equal but it would be great if they were all at least viable
---
Was this an official reply?
---
The sub with a hate boner for streamers allowing a post like this stay up? Color me surprised. 
---
I mean how does one person fail classic wow. There’s MILLIONS of people playing it. It’s been number one on twitch for a WEEK. There’s 100k people constantly fighting queues and classic is done because of Asmongold? 
---
Like avoiding going into intelligence because I fear the poster wouldn’t understand, this is a fuckin stretch. 
---
Who cares what a player does on his stream. Why bring it here. Why have a hate boner on streamers when they’re all on one server and affect NO ONE HERE. 
---
If we wanna upvote this shit than play by the rules. Stay true to vanilla. Put em on the ignore list and move on. These anti streamer posts that get dick rode to the top is what will do more harm than a sperg with 100k viewers grinding scarlet monastery and getting gold from his sperg viewers. This game is 15 years old. If you’re all gonna act like you started in 2004-06. Than what point is this bitter  streamer drama gonna do for this sub? You’re all in your 25-30s. Grow the fuck up already.
---
Honestly he’s a piece of hot garbage and it saddens me people support him at all. Loads of good streamers out there that aren’t cry baby jerks. Many of which people have mentioned before me here.
---
Very chill, very nice person
---
I cant say Ive watched him playing as my spare time has been playing as much as possible before I get busier again Tuesday but you sound spot on. There are a lot of things people value about vanilla and the world aspect of it feels like an important part. Him not exploring the world seems wrong to me. This as I am currently running to Hillsbrad for my Call of Water quest. Its fun feeling like you have to earn stuff. Seems he missed that boat too.
---
I didn't think we were talking about endgame DPS, just for a leveling Shaman. Using Rockbiter would likely outperform Windfury, however most are going to go WF just for that insta-gibb potential.
---
ALT F4 or Task Manager Close. It will count as a disconnect and you can log back in within 10 min.
---
Is there a time limit to this? Hopefully not since I'm really busy right now and the queues are really long, would definitely be down to play the game in a month or two.
---
We are queued for Herod.
---
You can do whatever. There is no main quest line. Nothing that you can’t just pick up later. Plenty of people just grind to 60, you do you.
---
Did you have a stroke? Also what is more sad than being an unpaid internet janitor? Being a wannabe volunteer internet janitor.

On launch there were plenty of servers, should’ve waited till launch
---
Asmon is just another loser who hasn't earned anything he has. He's another shit stain that lives his life by being a parasite to legions of brainless, drooling troglodytes who need a bigger loser to give meaning to their empty existences. 
---
The guy's life is the definition of parasitism. I honestly do not understand how someone can live a life where everything they have they have not worked for or earned it. He's just lucky that the majority of people on this planet are idiots who are soon parted from their money.
---
No, Vanilla fans are just comparing WoW to retail WoW, which is a handhold.
---
^^^ this
---
Yes do not use it or sell it for months. It'll be worth it. Maybe even hold on until after the first battlegrounds are out when more people will care about their twinks.
---
Wait what, flameshock is such a critical spell for me to use. Earthshock cost more mana and only does slightly more burst damage, way better using flameshock.
---
The mods of this subreddit are a ridiclous joke
---
but what he thinks doesn't matter, the truth is that anyone with a brain takes him for a clown. He can have as much money he wants good for him.
---
Yeah I’ve been playing Hunter since BC and I can definitely tell I don’t have to dismiss my pets before making tiny jumps over ledges or down holes like I used to have to back in the day. Pet pathing is definitely inline with modern pathing.
---
I dunno why people make it sound like this game is going anywhere anytime soon lol. Like just hop on get a level hop off or he’ll get half a level. Just enjoy the ride like you said you have been and chip away little at a time.
---
World first means nothing and it never has
---
I had a top level lmao when I saw dm 20+. You sad sad noobs there's no point even doing it at 20, other normal quests literally give better xp rewards.  the said part is they think they're the top level minds.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
I've been enjoying classic so far but damn this subreddit is a massive circlejerk
---
Why does this drama exist, can we just play the game instead of getting on with this fan boy shit?
---
the raid thing is messed up but the party thing is correct, this will never change now. The party thing is basically as good.
---
If they credit your battle.net account with a BFA license, you could just create a second WoW account, add BFA to it, and you would be able to apply the 110 boost to your main account instead.
---
That would be happening with or without streamers. It's just how the metagame works. A critical mass agree that X is the best way to do things, and that becomes flavour of the month.
---
You can usually make a ticket for a GM to give you one day of game time to collect gold from the mailbox. Done it a few times in the past
---
I think he's a great WoW personality, but I dont give him too much stock outside of his areas on expertise. WoW and Twitch meta are the two things he's good at, and he has genuinely good insight on.
---
So I just taught my wife from scratch (she never played WoW or even pc gamed ever) on classic release and she is now same lvl as me - 30 and killing people in PvP, so it can be done. It is daunting but rewarding.

First you need to understand basic MMO concepts and terminology. Start there.

'learn mechanics'
---
The mechanics in Classic content are laughably trivial compared to everything that has developed in WoW since 2006. 
---
Most MC bosses are tank swap + 1 other mechanic.
---
Grobbulus, it was the original one.
---
As a rogue say i have a sword with 2 second weapon speed. If i auto attack and after 1.8 seconds use sinister strike do i have to wait 2 seconds be it will auto attack again or will it auto after .2 seconds?
---
The point in fixing it is to
---
- Prevent further damage going forward (this isn't retail WoW where only level cap matters. Just because nolifers are hitting 60 next week doesn't mean leveling no longer matters to the game)
---
- Keep to the goal of "WoW as it was" (Differences/ are fine when they keep the spirit and philosophies of the original design. This does not reflect the original spirit or the philosophies responsible for it)
---
I don't think so. I think they know that the turnover is low for new players for retail and they see Classic as a better entry point, because leveling is so enjoyable.
---
Are they legitimate role players?  If not, why chose RPPVP?  Just curious.
---
Yeah madseason is awesome
---
the only rollback that would happen is rolling back everyone, not everyone who is doing it understands there should be a raid xp penalty, and rolling back everyone would just do more harm than good.
---
To hell with that. Back then the devs loved what they were doing and tried their best to deliver the best content. If they listened to every back seat driver giving directions we would end up with BFA again.
---
Didn't they make a habit out of buying out any MMO with the slightest of promise, and then cut all development after they acquired the games?
---
Just get int gear as you level talents are going to make massive difference for healing dungeons while you level so feel free to go down cereal for that extra speed in catform. Or the entangling balance talent for survival.

Nah I've been there. I'm a die hard scifi fan. Anarchy Online was my first MMO and remains my one true love. I've often wished to see a scifi-ier WoW.
---
  
---
Ironically, one of the things that hurt people's enjoyment of AO was an expansion that was very not scifi.
---
I'm a lvl 6 mage with Herbalism and Skinning. Should I drop skinning for tailoring or am I good to go ?  I don't know what professions to get .
---
Is this because they never played classic and don't know what to do?
---
AND WATCH THE FUCKING TAIL
---
I'm guilty of this sometimes. In my defense, I'm either multitasking or just not paying attention.
---
Sorry for failing you!
---
I cant see my herbs in all that grass !
---
Im ok with using frostbolt instead of fireball and that seems fun too!
---
QQ about it OP, it's just one person who can play how they want, piss off.
---
No. 
---
You get the item when you accept the quest. If you drop it and cancel it then you'll have to get it back by accepting the quest again. 
---
If you want to leave a reminder for yourself I'd recommend a notebook or post it notes.
---
Why? Why do you have to exclude people who want to play solo entirely? What do you GAIN from that? It doesn't make your group content any more fulfilling to intentionally make solo content a bad experience.
---
Players who don't want to group up shouldn't be clearing top tier raids, or dungeons - fine. But forcing players to socialize isn't a good way to build a multiplayer game. You can create opportunities for this without forcing it on players at every turn.
---
Your playing the AH at level 30 on a fresh server?
---
That's your problem right there. Level 30 warlock with 79g and all I've done is skin everything and vendor things I get.
---
Yeah most private server mobs/bosses had stats that scaled a little harder due to people generally being better at the game than they were in 2004. I’ve put a decent amount of time into private servers in the last 3 years and this is definitely easier.
---
Who is one shotting it?
---
If the top1% of guilds is able to one shot naxx, that doesn’t affect me at all. I’ll still be level 53 throwing baubles on my fishing rod
---
Asmongold is a piece of shit, I can't stand his chin-less banter. I made a mistake once to click on one of his videos and my whole youtube got infected with his face.
---
That looks insane dude... Straight out a cartoon!
---
or maybe we'd get burning crusade or wraith again
---
!RemindMe 15 hours
---
I get what you mean by 'catering to casuals' but I don't think the term is a good one. Casual players are fine with some difficulty and having to work for loot.
---
It's the bunch who want everything for nothing, no challenge, no social aspect. As Asmongold called them, "whiny babies". Those are the ones the devs catered to and that's what wrecked it.
---
Saying 'casuals' ruined the game makes people believe you have to be a basement dwelling non-life to get any enjoyment out of classic, and I believe that's totally false. Classic is the ultimate casual game.
---
It's just not a game for people who want handouts, instant satisfaction and no challenge.
---
Well I wasn't. I haven't really been looking at forums/reddit/playing retail at all for the past year. Is it just gonna remain absurdly easy forever or do you think they might change it once people notice and start complaining?
---
Windfury is specifically better if you have a better 1hander and shield to use than your 2hander with rockbiter.
---
10 man SM till 42 then one ulda then ZF till 53
---
so long gay bowser
---
Plus normal mobs spawn super fast because of dynamic respawning
---
Classic is definitely more casual friendly. Just the experience of leveling and adventuring through the zones is most of the content. 
---
In retail, leveling is just a means to get to the actual content which is end game dungeons, raids, and getting better gear for said content. Not to say that low and mid level stuff isn’t fun for some people, it’s just that Blizzard’s focus is on max level content. 
---
The free starter edition is retail only, so take that into consideration.
---
Wish they'd started with an earlier patch. People forget how much more powerful classes are later in vanilla. Unbelievable that this can be done with sub-60s and no fire resist.
---
What anyone thinks including you and I means nothing. Your opinion holds as much value as anyone.
---
The difference is he gets to make money from it.
---
Did you notice if he is doing shadow damage?
---
They look like they grind WoW themselves
---
You are talking about a group of private server players who have been doing this for 15 years and the game dying when exactly?.....
---
OHHHH MY GODDDDD 
---
Thanks for the reminder, what a blast from the past.  I played so much Peggle back in the ICC progression days.
---
Nothing inherently, except that they're not 40. 
---
I greatly enjoy the 20 man raids in vanilla. I also like the dynamics of 10 and 25 man raids in TBC. 
---
They are both inferior to 40 man. 
---
This is why Classic+ is the gold standard for post Naxx Classic content. They only started to scratch the surface with what could be done in 40 man raids, then they reduced it to 25 man to cater to the casuals. 
---
Go back to 40 man and see what you can come up with.
---
That's the spirit 🙋
---
Yes he is, and I found by way of Madseason's recommendation.
---
Couldn't have you RP's as an elf that was adopted by dwarfs and grew in ironforge?
---
AOE grinding on a mage is actually faster than questing, it's just super boring.
---
As far as I was concerned, when expansions came into WoW, it died.
---
I played the expansions, but I was always chasing what classic had as a standard. No expansion since recreated those moments for me.
---
The difference with watching a sport or esport is that you are watching people who are actually good at something. You are watching people do things you cannot physically do and you might even learn some new tricks when you watch them. Watching twitch streams is much more like watching reality TV.
---
Where does it say that? Every single time I have seen BfA promoted, it always mentions the boost that comes with it leaving me to believe this just people without BfA getting BfA and the level boost they love to mention all the time.
---
Okay thanks that’s good to know!
---
Did anyone actually say classic raiding was harder than retail unironically?   
---
I thought it was a wellknown fact that all raids in classic (yes even naxx) are a complete joke compared to the difficulty of todays mythic raids
---
As a rogue playing with my mates I seem to pull fuckloads of threat just by building up my combo points with sinister strike.
---
Was there anything said about moving into the expansions? Would love to play Wrath of the Lich King with my friends again. 
---
Thanks for any info.

There are some quests where I'm not given any item, but have to kills mobs for quest drops and even attempting to drop those prompts that it'll cancel the quest.
---
Instant cast abilities like SS don't interrupt your swing timer, so it will auto again after .2
---
who fucking cares
---
I love how the devs STILL keep talking about the 'nostalgia' as if the only thing keeping playing classic is reliving the glory days, instead of it just being a flat out better game.
---
Sounds like Joe.
---
For mages it'l be different. Stam is good for warlocks because they can convert HP into Mana and can use pet to tank.
---
I'm 100% new to wow and looking up guides, classes and stuff I've been put off from hunter because a lot of people said its bad for raids and dungeons (which is what im looking forward to the most). Is there any way I can make it work without being in a huge disadvantage?

Rock Paper Scissors Fear
---
Every single big streamer or youtuber that pushed classic failed it... Look at Sodapoppin not even a month ago he said he was not gonna stream classic so he can get the full experience. Fast forward to today and he has spent 99% of his time spamming dungeons.
---
Its crazy how people look at 2005 and compare it to 2019. But people arnt that bright anymore.
---
People have had 15 years to figure this game out. And for some reason people are shocked its easier after 15 years of getting good at games. Jeeze
---
Just hope it's a good MMO and they learned from their mistakes. Not holding my breath. Only one I'm even remotely looking forward to is pantheon and who knows if that will ever release. The MMO genre is so sad right now.
---
No kidding, the shapeshifting forms could be elementals of sorts!
---
Haven’t seen any of this activity on Skeram - Horde if anyone wants to avoid the retail gang.
---
To be fair, not all of us knew this was exploration.   
---
My guild of old guard players was incredibly surprised to find out that 10 man leveling was fast. Our new players that have never seen vanilla just assumed this was the way the game was, but even us older players that remembered playing vanilla back when it was current originally had assumed that we were remembering the game wrong.
---
There is like one rp pvp server right?  What are you deciding on?  Or did they add another?
---
Did you ever consider the possibility that it could be both?
---
When you were a kid, you probably skipped rocks on the lake. Today kids yeet them
---
I belive they recently changed it to be relative to server cap, so if it says "Full" there is a queue
---
&gt;Before 20 it's our only active attack ability
---
You get flame shock at level 10 and rank 2 of it at level 18. Which yes, does less damage, but it's an active attack ability ;)
---
That's what I said. Growing WoW horizontally. That's what that means.
---
Im also on noggenfogger! Whats your guilds name? Would be fun to see you around
---
OHH
---
DPS warriors are second class citizen. They're the classic equivalent of complaining about other people while living on welfare
---
People like it for the novelty.  But it’s not really that great of an item.
---
Ok
---
This is the authentic classic experience.
---
Ok I made a toon on a medium full server this morning and then now to try and log in it’s full and the wait time is 200 minutes ......stop giving them excuses they need to fix this shit.
---
The only reason I'd do that is for PvP tbh, its the most fun era of pvp for me in WoW by faar. The time to kill might legitimately be 30 times quicker than retail is now
---
I'll leave my downvote and continue on
---
Or if you just like to level and quest and don’t care about authenticity you can use the “azeroth autopilot” addon. It’s super nice for not feeling like being lost.
---
You do know that he‘s genuinely bad at the game right? He‘s horrible in both pve and pvp.
---
Type leveling guide in the search bar.
---
If you're more included toward old school RPG d&amp;d elements,  absolutely
---
The forsaken have always been evil. It made a lot more sense in classic when they were inherently less trusted than the rest of the horde and seen as a military requirement to function on the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Unless you're a druid and a max rank Healing Touch is 100% of the tank's health bar at lower levels. Then downrank.
---
I used to dream of reaching those spots as a kid every time I flew past. Grats
---
Correct.  People like to do this and think the tank is poor at tanking.  In reality DPS don't know when or what ability to use.  This first week has been good in learning who to ignore come 60 dungeons.
---
Then doesn't that mean they should go back to whatever formula wrath was if wrath had the most subs because with that logic wrath is better then vanilla
---
Hmmm that's pretty slick. Tempting to do this now even at lower levels.
---
For the Horde!
---
They tried to pretend she wasn't for a little while.
---
Just have trade chat on a different tab or just leave it all together. It’s mostly garbage.
---
You might have to abandon the quest and try to do it again. It'll be annoying, but should hopefully get it done
---
They wouldn't play it if they got nothing out of it dumb dumb
---
So I wish there was a clear cut answer that I could give and tell you. I personally told her we would be playing PVP as that was non negotiable for me lol. It's my favorite part of the game and the most rewarding but that is entirely subjective.
---
If you like the idea of while you are out in the open world questing or just killing mobs, that someone can come along and kill you or be killed PVP realms are for you.
---
If you like just being peaceful and doing your thing and later at the end of the game (lvl 60) you can do organized PVP then PVE realms are for you.
---
Your character is held on one single realm. If you go to a different realm, you will need to create a new character. No hopping in this game.
---
Roots &gt; cheetah &gt; gtfo. Good luck friend

You might have the friendly minions/pets nameplate tick under friendly nameplate.

Honestly; I like what he is. It's great that there is a streamer and "figure head" that has stuck with wow through everything and has such a following. HOWEVER, I really hate him man. He just pisses me off.
---
&gt;I really think the haters are just looking for excuses to hate him.
---
They don't seem to be looking that hard. I don't watch his streams but if he was talking some big talk then just sat around in an instanced raidfarm for most of the leveling experience he's basically experiencing a pvp server in name only.
---
Yes, but you have to shake it just so to get desired results
---
If you know what you're doing you picked the god class
---
So they don't ban for this right? Back in the day the rumor was always that it wasn't allowed.
---
What does it do?
---
Most servers are medium in the morning. They get full by noon. You should have made a toon on a low server to avoid queues.
---
Quivers are for arrows
---
Just stay away from streamers and their beta followers. After all their opinion isn't worth to be heard let alone to be taking into consideration. These people are only doing this for their own gain if you didn't know it yet.
---
People have been min/maxing since literally the game released, get over it.
---
Perfectly stated.
---
I missed using Maul on next swing and spamming Swipe. It's nice being perpetually immune* to crits though.
---
True, but a ridiculous part of today's culture.
---
We’ve done it multiple times this week lol
---
The original game still has more active players tho....I don't understand the infatuation with this. Classic fanboys are literally half brained. You all seriously take the cake when it comes to fanboys cringe.
---
Can’t fix it now that would be super unbalanced. You give those who are using it a severe advantage over those who didn’t take a week off to get into ZF already
---
Please explain how exactly what you just said is even remotely true?
---
If I get T3 and I wear it, you know I got T3.
---
If I get T3 but because it’s not BIS or something and I transmog it over a BIS piece, *i still got the T3 pieces*.
---
But maybe I got T3 and I’d rather look like Tirion Fordring a’la EPL Classic.  Why shouldn’t I be able to?
---
I honestly don't care - you are irrelevant. I'm enjoying classic. try not being toxic?
---
Wow has always be seen as casual since its 2005 days (it was already mocked by senior mmo players from other titles)
---
There is a fair amount of toxicity that I notice in chats while playing classic with people apparently more concerned about hating retails and showing that they are the good guys than people just enjoying a old version of the game a lot of us enjoyed years ago ...
---
They already do this by living in instances though.
---
You make an excellent point, sir!

Way better.

because influence? ive played on  private servers including nostalrius pretty consistently over the last like 7 years and i have NEVER seen a 10 man raid farming scarlet monastery to power level. but now all of a sudden im seeing the trade chat spam LFM for SM farming raid. i guess it ultimately doesn't affect me personally but i absolutely feel bad for these people who are being influenced and will miss out on what classic is really about
---
bro....
---
oh you got me lol
---
They are not even close to being able to clear MC right now though? It will take them at least a few more days to have enough people at 55+ to be able to clear it.
---
Lol. Im currently sitting in queue with reddit and switch.
---
Seriously. Good post, but I dont watch streamers. Who has time for that? I'm playing games myself.

You can make a macro to start wanding when you cast a certain spell.

The faster these types hit max level and run out of content, the better.

Brilliant. This is why WoW will always hold a special place in my heart.

I'm getting married in two weeks and a mate I've played with for years is spending 1.5k to fly to the wedding. I've attended music festivals with mates from classic and tbc who live in another country.

It's an amazing thing.
---
Why is nobody talking about Moo\_uk? Monkeynews FTW!
---
Why would you even bother reposting this to the same subreddit it came from..
---
Correct, but they are still categorized as raids.
---
Really? There’s been no noticeable drop. Classic won’t last long.
---
Yeah, you need all that spare time to stay in queue so you don't lose your spot.

The amount of people who think Classic should be played a certain way is disturbing.
---
Well nothing is going to change, so...
---
Luckily there are still a good amount of people who know what they’re doing. I’d imagine you’ve just had the misfortune of running with some of the worst. It’ll all level out eventually.

Just wanted to encourage the use of macros. I played UD rogue back in the day and macros made PvP much much easier

---
Yeah warlocks are king of 1v1 in classic... And tbc... And always
---
Yeah just flat out ignore. Trust me I wouldn't be so mad and complain this much if I didn't go out of my way to try everything possible. I load in spam LFG in LFG chat, post it in world chat, ask in general chat, anyone who runs me gets an invite and immediately declines it. The people who do accept might stick around until the quest is done but will usually leave once they are personally finished. I've tried just searching in /who for anyone my level in the zone and just send invites to everyone on the list. I managed to get one person to accept and I said oh let me come help you with relics, and as soon as I get there they leave group. I've met like two people who actually wanted to play for a bit, but they've already moved on to other characters and aren't interested in grouping anymore. I've joined the classic wow guilds discord and eventually got accepted to a guild called NaCl, and while playing I kept asking hey anyone want to level with me? But no level 7 is too low and nobody is going to make a new character to play or come join with their current character because then they wouldn't get xp and it'd be a waste.

Try lowering your polling rate. I had the same problem and this fixed it. If you have mouse software like raxer synapse, just go into mouse setting and change your polling to like 125. I used to get the same problem but changing this fixed it for me.
---
its asmon what did you expect ? guy literaly need the biggest lift from half the server to be decent at the game, and act like's a god.   
---
I'm still amaze he blew up on twitch. I don't understand what people find appealing in his stream.
---
Probably cause I'm EU and don't really get the Us mentality maybe...
---
i feel like your melee macros could be better. I had all my melee abilities on one macro and it would use the attack macros unless wing clip was applied to the enemy.
---
Skinning
---
Druid is a hit and run class. If you like quick fights, druid isn't a good idea. Cat Form, bear Form, root, heal, nuke, bear Form, etc. It's all about out lasting the enemy.
---
I seriously don't get the appeal. I understand if they're insanely good at the game, or are speedrunning/doing challenges, or it's a pro match, or they're playing something you don't have access to and you want to see gameplay. 
---
But streamers like Asmon are none of those things. The only argument you can make for why they're worth watching is personality, but to watch what is basically an unprepared stream of conscious for 8hrs and still be entertained means you need a personality that's basically a show just by itself. I'm talking a personality like Bill Burr, and even then I don't know if unprepared he'd be entertaining for more than 30 minutes. 
---
I feel like the only reason these streamers are important and popular, is because people just randomly decided they are. I appreciate people like DrDisrespect for trying to put on an actual show, but for the most part Twitch is just full of boring man-children playing video games and half-interacting with chat. They bait you into thinking you're friends with them because they say your name when you give them money, but you gotta be hella lonely if you think that's any sort of meaningful interaction. And the social aspect of chat doesn't exist either because it moves so fast it's just frantic shitposting.
---
I legit don't understand why anyone would watch a stream over the millions of other free online entertainment options you have. Listen to a podcast, watch a YouTube channel, hell even a generic vlogger talking about their day is usually better content than a stream. Streamers do not matter and why anyone gives a single fuck about them is beyond me.
---
Has always been this way tho bro. Why do you think the stigma of bear tank bad still is around. Even though classic is a 1.3 build and bear tanks post 1.2 are awesome and have the largest armor pool with dire bear 340% armor buff. Also the highest threat generation. Wow elitests are the same be it retail or classic. Solid quest grinding is not much slower and way more enjoyable anyway.
---
Mobile games!!!!
---
If anyone takes his personality seriously and doesn’t like him because of it, you’re an idiot.
---
Peoples pointless opinions are what destroys games and need to be shut down.
---
The reason Hunter is a disadvantage in raids and dungeons is that it's very easy for hunters to screw over the entire group which makes noobs (i.e., "huntards") radioactively undesirable. Aspect of the Pack, pet growl left on by unskilled operators, rolling on caster gear, running out of ammo, etc. You can excel but it will take a lot of preparation, micromanagement, and extra effort to stand out from the pack. Leveling BM can be pretty mindless solo, but when targeting priorities enter the picture the field really opens up with what hunters are capable of. Feign death + jumper cables are a unique utility. There's plenty of space to do well as a hunter but you have to be a little extra.
---
They are but I can understand his sentiment. The only thing really similar between classic and retail raids is that we refer to them both as raids.
---
Having a smoke and a sandwich doesnt take an hour so why would you need macros. I sense bullshit. Also if you still have major queues you clearly picked a high pop server so you knew this was coming.
---
The QoL stuff is part of what makes retail trash. 
---
Flying mounts, LFG and all that make the world not matter.
---
I would like you to know, that Guild names are exempt from the RP naming policy so long as they are not offensive ect. You are encouraging people to report guild names as well.
---
I hape unless the 110 Boost is for everyone, not just for who havent got BfA
---
It's an addon, it's been mentioned multiple times in this thread hours before you commented...
---
Pick a realm with lower pop. I've literally never seen a queue on my server.
---
Hi, /u/LimitsMet

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cyi28x/are_there_any_breakdowns_of_factionraceclass_for/). 
---
you're welcome
---
I for one welcome this change. Not that I am butt hurt people do it, but because they are fixing stuff that isnt intended.
---
Gamers rise up! 
---
Op is so melodramatic.
---
They guy doesn't know more about the game or how to play it than anyone else. The difference between him and us is that we're not popular streamers.
---
Press N or click the Talent page on the bottom of the screen. 
---
There are primary and secondary professions. You can get every secondary but only 2 primary. The secondary ones are first aid, fishing and cooking. Yes you have to find a trainer to begin. 
---
For making money taking two gathering professions is a good choice, like skinning and herbalism. But for a warrior mining and smithing are good because you can often make yourself decent weapons and armour.
---
Probably a supremely unpopular opinion here, but... Classic has been live for less than a week. We're likely going to see a massive dropoff in players after the first month or two as the nostalgia wears off and people either go back to retail or just stop playing WoW altogether.
---
Once again, just like how every MMO to be released since WoW became popular was touted as a "WoW killer" but wasn't, Classic is being touted as a "retail killer" and absolutely will not be.
---
(And on a personal note, I get that people are disappointed with BfA and the direction retail WoW is going, but I'm a bit tired of the toxic circlejerk about how it's all garbage and Classic is "real" WoW. Just play what you enjoy without rubbing it in everyone else's face...)
---
Does plate armor make that noise when you walk? I don’t remember that
---
There are forum posts using VC dates before Dire was released.
---
hey, i am on grob as well. i am not super into RP but i wish we could be friends. except i am an undead warlock. i will keep an eye out for you ;)
---
My memory of that place is 1000x more amazing than it really was.  This was by far the best looking zone.
---
Well there's likely to be some differences in mob behavior on classic vs. a private server. Also I think the race to 60 is probably the bigger hurdle than actually clearing the raids. I definitely think it's up in the air for ZG/BWL
---
He has a point. Classic advocates sprays talked about loving hard dungeons that required cc and the aoe spam introduced in wotlk is so so so evil.
---
Now people are spamming the hell out of dungeons with no concern for a challenge or cc.
---
But people will always be turds.
---
And the ride now ends. Back to questing.
---
Well, dwarves aren't the sharpest tools in the shed. That's why they use pellets still. smh
---
Probably good in the long run but see the words " XP awarded should be significantly lower" is soul crushing for someone grinding.
---
Ok dire maul

This has been asked and answered in this thread multiple times hours before you commented...

i'm the opposite. i've been on 10-12 hours every day since Tuesday and i can't get enough lol.

I'm new sorry. I've picked up skinning, but am failing to see how I can make lots of coin from it. How is it so profitable?
---
You can make green quality robes with tailoring from linen cloth disenchant those and then use mats to do bracer enchants, this works up till about 75 then you need to move on to wool items and higher level enchants
---
LMAO
---
So... rollbacks? Or are all those who abused it gonna get away with it?
---
Watching a stream is like watching a fat guy kick a soccer ball at a wall for 8 hours.
---
Nobody watches mediocre non-professionals play sports poorly aside from parents watching their children.
---
Not a valid comparison.
---
It makes me speechless that the two biggest WoW Classic Streamers are the biggest buffoons.
---
They opened it on the night of launch, around 10pm EST.
---
They want to be able to do it to the other faction while not have it done to them
---
was more of a joke because wall hopping was removed
---
I couldn't wall hop, but I wish it was allowed still, people getting ontop of crazy stuff was vanilla

Go to the zackrawrr channel and watch some of the videos behind the camera he seems like a really nice guy

Yes but as others have stated what we all did 15 years ago is pretty bad to judge us for.
---
12-13 year olds don't have the best judgement.
---
Hell I took advantage of one of my guilds back then.  But I'm a really good guildie since then, fair officer, and unselfish now.
---
one syllable words only please
---
Jesus fucking Christ you are dumb
---
Don't get caught up in what's most optimal. A lot of the class/race combination meta only will only be apparent at a higher level of play anyway. Since you're new, you should just be playing the class you think will be the most fun first and foremost, then whatever race you think will look the coolest, since you'll be staring at their ass for dozens if not hundreds of hours. The last thing you want is to play something you don't like for a marginal increase in power for specific situations.
---
It’s the opposite of “Kobe”
---
Rude
---
Not everybody has to queue up all the time you know
---
I'm guessing a lot of Classic players have never played Legion, I thought it was incredible. I'm certain a lot of players here would have approved of the Order halls, class/spec specific artifact weapon quest lines. Hell, world quests brought back world content which at that point was dead, and while people don't like them much today, they were really popular when they first came out.
---
There was controversy over legendaries being completely random and some people didn't like grinding AP, but the first Raid tier of legion was so fantastic.
---
Nah man I like the idea of spending 18 hours farming up 130k gold to the tune of 14.99USD. 
---
I love working for $0.83 an hour.
---
Meme aside.
---
We've had 15 years of retrospect on class roles in classic. There is no excuse to be salty in Classic now. This is why as an ex-feral druid I'll be making a rogue.
---
27 and no kids. Bless up.
---
That's really weird
---
When you DC, you have a grace period of a few minutes. Perhaps people are DCing, your queue number drops then they get back in via the grace period (thus, rising your number)? 
---
Admittedly, that would only be a few here or there; not continuously rising
---
This thread is so fucking stupid lmao. why do you give a fuck about how he plays the game and how are you in any way surprised hes playing the same exact way he always has.
---
watch his stream, he keeps reading this thread lmao
---
Him being ridiculous is not an opinion. It's not debatable.
---
Yeah. Classic has bugs just like any other game. Good on them to care and fix it quickly to preserve game health.
---
He never said he was good. Just that he had a good heart and general knowledge of the game.
---
Come join me on Netherwind in a bit. Horde
---
I never said he was good at the game. Quite frankly, he doesnt have to be. He knows enough about it the game and thats all I’m looking for in a content creator. I couldnt care less if he is top pvp or world first level 60, I just care that watching his videos/streams are a genuinely enjoyable experience.
---
Yeah well it would be like totally unrealistic for the top 1% of a society to work against the best interests of the rest of the population for personal gain, right?
---
And then SKIPPED everything he preached about. Rofl. Twitch chat lfg system. Free gold. Literally carried through the game while making money. I'm pretty jelly but then again I have irl friends.
---
Throws the skull to the ground.
---
Ill check it out, thanks.
---
You are an idiot. Asmongold didn't fail classic wow, he saved it. By rolling on the same shithole that every other streamer was rolling on, he kept 99% of the player base intact on their servers. He is creating his content on his own little server with the rest of them and leaving you alone. You are the one seeking out what he is doing. If you don't like the game, don't play it. But he's not the one failing classic wow right now, you are. "play it the way i want you to play it." is the shittiest attitude I've seen around the classic wow community.
---
Well this is my view on the matter... I played a *lot* of vanilla, some TBC, a bunch of WoTLK and then fell off somewhat after that (cata just wasn't interesting to me).
---
But in vanilla, the grind is there and very very long... but it doesn't move. Wanna get that rep to exalted? You can play an hour a day for months or 18 hours a day for weeks. You play at *your pace* and the world just waits for you.
---
Retail? Nope. You want to progress you need to log in every single day for extended periods. Do your dailies every day. Do your instances every day. Do you grinds every day. You miss out on a few weeks and they are *gone*, that's progress you can't get back.
---
I don't like that, even if it works out easier or whatever else.. it's just not an appealing model to me.
---
**LIVE TO WIN**
---
Some quivers have buffs like bonus attack speed, pretty sure that's what OP was referring to
---
You're wrong. I've never thought highly of him.
---
Huh, my version must be corrupted or something. I'll try again, thanks.
---
tirisfal glades is not going to be happy about this
---
I watch twitch all day long, but every time i checked in on one of these guys, it was scarlet monastery.  for 5 days straight.  some of them are still doing it.  least compelling streams I've ever seen.  Instead, I'm watching a subnautica stream
---
That's what I thought. I haven't yet made a character yet on the server I just joined for my friends. I'm wondering if I'm a low priority person in line since I don't have a character yet, is that something Blizzard might have done?
---
You’re telling me that my question was just answered?
---
Yet another thread proving the majority of reddit users are a bunch of boring, spiteful and envious cunts.
---
&gt; You sad sad noobs there's no point even doing it at 20, other normal quests literally give better xp rewards.
---
Fun + good drops.
---
Why do you even care ? And he’s playing the game how he wants. Go play yours.... I don’t get posts like this. Just hate for the sake of drama. Get out of here with that.
---
Yep! There are 4 strips, each about 12 inches long. The connection between strips 2 and 3 is right at the break between the monitors so I can move them without having to pull the strips off.
---
I figured. But I think they only work for crossbows and bows
---
I would love a WoD take two. So many good ideas/stories wasted on that expansion.
---
such a bot lmao.. so who u gunna sell this account to?
---
Well I used to raid vanilla and BC on 300 ping, there were no Australian servers back then.  But we got by with the quartz add on and stopcast macros :D
---
That's some quest log porn.
---
Just gotta watch those grey mobs resist your spells. 
---
Young Wolf I thought we moved passed this? I just want your meat to level my cooking. No need to try hard here, I'm 20 levels over you.
---
Ctrl v does both too.
---
Oh fuck off, leveling in classic is nowhere near the mind numbing easy mode in retail, you can't even fucking die if you pull multiple mobs and your mana doesn't matter.
---
Good
---
Yep, I have a cheap desktop with no graphics card and it runs fine
---
You are way overvaluing escape artist, yes it's helpful but an entire faction of rogues does just fine in PvP without it.  Its a perk, and shouldn't be a crutch. 
---
If he likes his NE rogue it's 100% better to enjoy playing your character.  If he has no real preference, then sure, reroll.
---
Haven’t waited in a queue once since launch. Pick a lower pop server and you’ll be fine, you can sub now if you want.
---
People care about gown men playing a child's game..so is it really any different?
---
I just realized ...

Ned Stark

Tony Stark

I was so confused for a second

No one knew it was a bug why they should be punished lol
---
I'm a shadow priest in that duo. I need to be in a duo. I'd probably just reroll paladin if I didn't have a personal tank.

The word "queue" is just the letter q followed by four silent letters.

Maths and reasoning: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cyb1d3/missing_raid_xp_penalty_bug_needs_to_be_fixed/
---
I don't watch streamers but I always got the impression that they were all just funded by their viewers in terms of gold/runs.
---
Wow character versions of rich kids.
---
Asmongold is a character, much like some "shock jocks", they're playing their part and they're playing it for the $$$. Posts like this are exactly what they want, because they want notoriety. Asmongold knows he'll never be known as the best wow player, so he's going for most notorious. He wants you watching his stream, just waiting for these gotchya moments you're bringing up here, and then posting about it. Then his chat goes wild, he has something to talk about and make content about...and the cycle continues.
---
Asmongold appeals to a certain segment, it's not me, but that's not to disrespect to his fans, it's just not something I enjoy. But his viewers don't want to see him play "pure", they're watching because they know he won't and the want to "catch him". It's a game, they know, he knows it, you really should know it too.
---
Honestly if this was the worst bug effecting week 1 they've done incredibly well. It was a minor boost to levelling at best, probably only 10-20% faster than 5 man levelling. The biggest thing was just that it was boring and easy so it's a nice thing to fix before it's meta and everyone's doing it.
---
Who cares how he plays he game. It’s not ruining it for other people. SM grinding mages only is a problem but nothing to do with any streamer. Asmon probably will have an alt he plays off camera like most streamers will. And if he doesn’t who cares. Classic is here classic is fun. I did SM twice and went back to questing even though it’s slower.
---
Classic highlights what a bad place retail has ended up in. Retail is like being on trolley tracks and cookie cutter builds with no choice. Classic has a real community RPG feel to it, with variations on builds and choices.
---

yall a bunch of losers honestly. wtf is this? a thread on a name that should make people mad - that actually made people mad?

---
The primary ones are skinning, herbalism, mining, tailoring, smithing, leatherwork, alchemy, enchanting and engineering. 
---
The difference between primary and secondary is that you can only pick 2 primary ones, everyone gets to have all the secondary ones.
---
Wowhead has some stuff to look this up but generally speaking SM has quite a bit for casters and warriors my hat carry for a while. It will mostly be dungeon and some class quests.
---
Most detrimental drugs to the US, heroin, meth, crack, pharmaceutical pills. And now... the return of WowCrack
---
The Scarlet Crusade would beg to differ.
---
yeah that's the same ^^^^/s  
---
sorry you have to play the game now lmao
---
Nah dude going hardcore is for casuals
---
My kids have been in school for a month now... what's this labor day back to school crap?
---
You do realize he said he's going to level a secret alt to actually play the game? Even yesterday he said you cant play wow while streaming. And yea, it's impossible. 
---
Constant 40 man raid groups ready to stream snipe you in particular was nowhere in classic.
---
play what u think looks coolest
---
It’s how they were in classic.
---
Maybe I'm missing something, but to me a streamer is just some person who decided to turn their webcam on.  I don't understand how they are held to such high regards and expectations.
---
The one in stormwind doesn’t train 2 hand mace. Is there one that does?
---
I really really hope later down the line they release burning crusade. That’s when this game was at its peak. Also I really want to make a blood elve pally :)
---
I mean.. he has said it several times during classic and during retail. He is NOT going to go out of his way to farm items when it’s a 100% fact that his followers will send him what ever he needs the moment he even mentions anything to do with needing it. He has stated that he knows this, so he just plays the game how ever he wants, the way he wants, in the time frame he wants, and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop him because it all comes back to his followers literally giving him anything and everything. If it takes him 6 mo this to clear BWL, then it takes 6 mo this to clear BWL. If his followers carry him through BWL day one, then his followers carry him through BWL day one..    
---
    
---
Seriously though.. try playing an MMO with a fucking army following you around and tell me you would deny every single bit of loot they give you for as long as you play the game. When dozens of people are spamming in your face to take the free stuff.. eventually you will just start to take the free stuff and learn to adapt your play style around it.     
---
That’s what Asmongold has done. He adapted his play style. Sure sometime he can be a bit rude with his “OOO I WANT THAT” attitude, but it’s his followers that pretty much made him that way. The mentality of getting things handed to you isn’t just in game. I’m sure some of you know a few people in your life that way, all because of how they were raised.   
---
It translates to the same thing in a gaming world. Like Method during the last RWF clear.. they cleared several servers worth of materials.. and people were happy to help.      
---
      
---
Let the dude do his thing. If he gets Thunderfury because his followers helped farm it and give it to him.. what’s it to you? It’s a game. Go get some fresh air if it’s such a big deal to you on how SOMEONE ELSE plays a video game.      
---
     
---
Asmongold is not obligated to do what you want him to do just because you subscribed to him. You subscribed to him because you like what he was doing to begin with.
---
So just because it wasn't apart of the meta, we can't do it? There's thousands of things that are done in vanilla today that weren't apart of the meta back then. Times change, get over it.
---
Yeah, the Plebs.
---
About time
---
I mean, servers are losing pop, but that's completely normal for any online game. Personally, I think the lack of depth in combat and the reality that many players have done all this before will hurt the games population, but it's far to early to get any meaningful info about that.
---
**HEY THE RELOSER**
---
Why did it take me so long to realize it said "HEY THERE LOSER"
---
Standard world pvp doesn't include having people follow your ghost on stream during corpse runs. That's what people were doing to Soda. Literally walking next to his ghost as he was walking to his corpse after they'd already killed him, waiting to do it again. Pretending getting streamsniped is just normal world pvp is disingenuous. Obviously it's a problem streamers opt into, but acting like it's nothing worth worrying about isn't really fair.
---
You should prolly realize that he is a [character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5G6bWFzCtE) and that this falls right into his character flaws of being a terrible person.
---
This seems more like advertising.
---
You'll need an add on
---
shame it took them so long to react, its a needed nerf but the damage is done
---
I do think it's bullshit how much farther alliance warriors have to travel to do the berserker stance quest.
---
You are in the starter zone it is intentionally easier. A lot of your complaints go away right when you leave.
---
Retail has less abilities but it has more defined/'smooth'/complex rotations. Compare a BfA/Legion frost spec rotation to classic, where you literally spam frostbolt. Worlds apart. Lots more active procs and tbh more involved rotations. 
---
What's impressive is despite that, Classic feels better.
---
how you are meant to play the game is arbitrary.
---
/r/misleadingthumbnails
---
No changes as in no changes to things that weren't in Vanilla. The way it worked was a bug in Classic.
---
How does it run classic ?
---
Yea, I agree. Personally I'm hoping for either classic raiding becoming more like retail, or retail everything else becoming more like classic. I'd play either game, but as they are right now it's tough to decide.
---
Link your armory and say retail is too easy. Bet you never did anything notable in retail regarding heroic or mythic raiding.
---
What time are you logging on? I haven't seen a queue since a couple days after launch on blaumeux.
---
You’re fine. There is a wand at 30, but you can ignore them. I’m in the 40’s and haven’t done one yet.
---
This post is actually pathetic
---
That I'd a normal way of playing.  Scarlet is a great series of dungeons in that level range.
---
But that isnt what anyone is talking about.
---
They could just release multiple time lines and let the player choose when they want to play.
---
to be fair he is on a pvp server and will get stream sniped alot so he cannot level like normal people hence dungeon grinding. I dont know why you are mad.
---
If it's a bug fix it, no reason to argue about it. Just a shame it came this late.
---
He did it for the last 15 years
---
not buying gold in Classic, i'm using Retail to buy the WoW Token so I can use the subscription to keep playing Classic.
---
Yep, I honestly don't understand the approach from a lot of people. A decade of talk about the "spirit of Vanilla" only to AoE grind dungeons as if it was BFA anyway, disgraceful.
---
replaces the quest givers/gossip/talk interface with a dialog/talking head style UI, similar to some retail high end quests, like when you talk with Khadgar or someone like that. Splits the text in pieces and makes a dialog out of it. Pretty much forces you to read as well and looks really good, Blizzard style (it copies it anyway) Here's a video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwe0yZ4xdGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwe0yZ4xdGM)  
---
I recommend turning off the auto scroll, turn on hiding other UI and turn on "Immersive" mode for mouse
---
I really can't see the issue with people wanting to level up fast AND whatever method they chose to use. Please do enlighten me on how MY classic experience gets worse / affected by people rushing to lvl 60 and accepting donations from their viewers. (Accepting donations is kinda a streamers job, no matter where the income come from, even if it's a virtual donation.)
---
good lmao
---
ppl rolling on pvp servers and holing up in instanced dungeons
---
Warrior is definitely never referred to as hybrid and they tank and dps.
---
This is just wrong.
---
Um... retail is awful
---
For most guilds that are world first material, after progression stops they can resume their life's and just join for guild events which become rare as time goes by... 
---
I also value more the speed runs than the world firsts.
---
Are you 5 years old?
---
So how does quest progression work i  this game pve. Like i am a level 11 tauren warrior, do i play specific quests for my race, can i play the quests i am doing now with any race, is there a main quest line? Basically is there a reason to play another race after awhile or can every quest be done with one race.
---
Lf 8 mAgEs sM ArMoRy SpAm
---
Which would actually be amazing content for viewers and participants, except that isn't playing out because Asmon lives in dungeons to avoid this. 
---
The idea that your faction essentially has a "VIP" to protect while the other faction ruthlessly tries to ruin their gameplay experience is super neat.
---
I don't think so. The closest thing you can come to is Atlas Loot.
---
Peace, friend.
---
Punkrat? Is that you?
---
Good, now roll back the people who abused it, clearly it was exploiting that now has given people a bigger advantage than before it got nerfed.
---
&gt; it certainly is peculiar to see all those people who declared their love for the heart and soul of vanilla now AoE-grinding Scarlet Monastery in 10-man raids for days on end
---
Thing is, there were people who did things like that.  It *is* the "true spirit of vanilla."  There wasn't just one specific way to play.  If there was, it wouldn't have been as amusing.  Grinding mobs for XP has always been a way some people leveled.  Some people like that more than questing.  Heck, questing was such an afterthought to WoW that it's not really finished in vanilla, and you can see how rough it is Horde-side where they rushed it.  I personally prefer questing, even when it can get a bit rough with repetitive nonsense sending me back to the same place repeatedly or has poor drop rates or whatever.  But other people don't.  And there are options for them, just as there always were.
---
I was bound to Whitemane due to friends playing there and not being able to coordinate the move. Thankfully I work nights and am usually playing before the queues fire up. Today, the inevitable happened and I was disconnected and had to queue back up... 7500+ queue. Feels bad.
---
I think I'd take a server transfer if they offered it at this point.
---
Honestly, I’d rather pay $15 and not work for game time
---
hype does stupid things to people, and you can't blame streamers for being stuck up their own butts when they already have 30k 14-year-olds up there.
---
Link?
---
It's the retail way of thinking. Rush to max level cause endgame is supposedly the only thing that matters.
---
Think it's ctrl+1 been a while though lol
---
Who cares Jesus fuck
---
So you last played something like 6 or 7 years ago and even though Blizzard said explicitly that there are no changes you're insisting they've changed things.
---
Hmm.
---
Yeah I have an engineer in Retail so he's making the mounts when he gets enough of the parts.
---
LFG/LFR is objectively the WORST feature in retail, and has all bull killed player interaction. 
---
Why would you miss this?
---
This is good, this meta is so boring. Now idc what people do to level but I don't understand why you'd want to do that in classic, in classic leveling feels like a part of the game. I'm doing professions, worrying about gold and gear and I'm not even 60. Dungeon grinding for endless hours is such a retail mentality and i can see those people getting burned out super quick. Also to note I'm not a big leveling fan. I doubt I'll do it again until TBC is announced and I play for the endgame but in classic it feels worth it
---
Literally who the fuck cares?
---
Click the other option he has when you talk to him and it should tell you, but I believe you need to go to Ironforge for Mace training?
---
I cant believe people get this riled up over a fucking entertainment streamer... Unless you play on his server (which is your fault, you have no reason to be on it) nothing he does effects you.
---
It's the solution. Merges are going to take care of future problems.
---
I'm pretty sure that's how it worked back then. I remember seeing the server list with the number of characters i had on them. 
---
Not sure if there is any way to change it though
---
Yes, you'll get everything in WoW retail if you own BFA.
---
Yea, let's talk more about classic and less about retail then....
---
I had that keyboard and mouse.
---
I replaced the mouse but used the keyboard extensively until I lost the wireless USB adapter. It’s also the fastest keyboard I’ve ever used.
---
They just hotfixed it
---
If a weapon trainer doesn’t train the well you need, you can ask them what the other trainers will train you and go from there
---
I would like you to know, that there is not a single part of anything I posted about guild names. You are upset about your guild name, I get that. Stop blaming people who had nothing to do with it. So once again, try again, because so far it simply seems like you are the one with the problem. I will not alter anything on my post because there is nothing wrong with it.
---
I think it’s iron forge
---
mines going down perfectly normal for grob right now.
---
Who fucking cares? Play the game yourself rather than watching some social reject streamer play lmao
---
ROLL THEM BACK
---
&gt; You failed classic, you failed your fans, but most of all, You failed yourself.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; We thought more highly of you.
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; You're disappointing.
---
I hope you are just naive and young because this comes off as borderline obsessive otherwise.
---
BlIzZaRd KnOWs WhAt TheY ArE DoIng
---
gg gz to all the 60's who abused this.
---
I dont know, im still in queue.
---
How is grouping up not optional in classic? Just dont do the dungeons and you will get to 60 so no probs
---
There is none you goober.
---
maybe people will actually play the game instead of just looking at their XP bar now
---
Every single player that has come up to me while I’m fishing has accused me of being a bot and they jump around on my lures for a couple minutes then leave. I find it hilarious! Like yeah dude.. there’s some people that actually want to fish while listening to music and shooting the shit in discord for an hour or two...
---
Don't have the budget to spend an extra 15 a month when I can just easily craft stuff like the mounts in Retail to do the job for me.
---
Gnome mage is really good. Just keep leveling and pwn noobs.
---
Nah it's like Dark Souls
---
There isn’t one, and won’t be one later. Part of classic.
---
This is a fantastic fix, the cleave raid teams made it hard to find a legit 5man dungeon group, especially for ZF.
---
/u/Jetah 
---
Why aren't you on here flexing your rulebook?
---
A lot of people never played in vanilla and had no idea it was a bug. Nobody is getting rolled back lol
---
Hey, is everything alright dude?
---
The service works, this isnt new. There were ques for the big servers in vanilla. Reroll or deal with the wait, it really is that simple. No one gives a shit about your time and who pays for your account. You sound like an entitled jerk saying that. Reroll or wait, up to you.
---
You know... I've been watching video after video about classics skill trees. And guess what. The debate about "The Best" builds is still on even after all these years.
---
There is a lot of people that think that x is the proper way to do something. No, it is that person's opinion. 
---
I remember making silly warlock specs and pwning people in duels because I wasn't playing as expected.
---
Why is it a question of "should be able to handle it"? There's an option to avoid it so why wouldn't you take it? I'm sure if you were getting corpse camped you'd have a cry yourself. You'll claim you wouldn't but anyone would, especially if it was personal.
---
There is a difference between forcing players to do an activity and allowing them to. Players CAN group up on retail as much as they want. In classic, they don't really have much choice. The fact that players choose not to group up in retail shows how many players simply don't want to.
---
I really can't see the issue with people wanting to level up fast AND whatever method they chose to use. Please do enlighten me on how MY classic experience gets worse / affected by people rushing to LVL 60 and accepting donations from their viewers. (Accepting donations is kinda a streamers job, no matter where the income is from, even if it's a virtual donation.)
---
Someone would def pay a pretty penny for that. Not sure how much, but probably a lot
---
Are you in Oklahoma? I am!
---
What no. Most of apes are old people with jobs and families. They said the average age of the world first raid was 31. They just booked vacation time off of work.
---
He can do it now because he's ahead of most people. If he'd quested from the beginning he would be camped the second he set foot in STV.
---
Hey I understood that reference!
---
Yeah and that's a completely reasonable counter tbh. he legit can't just solo run around and do stuff and stream it, that's fair.  
---
But regular normal 5 mans are a reasonable counter to that.
---
The extreme no lifers are a super tiny percentage of the total players
---
You can still dungeon spam as 5 man groups like APES did.
---
This guy was actually running 10 accounts, I saw him "cleaving" through wc later on today.
---
Good luck with that.
---
What about people who really like PvP, but realize that Phase 1 has nothing PvP-related so it's best to just rush to 60?
---
Back in vanilla I spent like 80% of my time doing battlegrounds and 20% hating myself with leveling. Took me something like 20 days /played to hit 60.
---
Wow lol
---
Nah, it's not.
---
Well his job is streaming...
---
You clearly don't know wtf is going on, and haven't played on a to rp-pvp server. He isn't witch hunting, he's making sure RPers have their own space, so they aren't harassed by dipshits.
---
lol
---
based
---
Yet he is making more than you ever will just by playing video games. His entire gimmick is that he's a no life neckbeard that does nothing but play WoW all day, and tries to fit all the elitist WoW stereotypes. If I could make as much money as he does just by living in a mess I'd do it in a heartbeat.
---
It absolutely does not "work out". an extra 2 agility does not in any way, shape, or form make up for losing escape artist in PvP.
---
If only more people in Azeroth would stop using plastic straws!!!!
---
Many people wanted the best of both worlds. Rush to 60 on your first character through these exploits, then enjoy the leveling process on your 2nd. You get a high level alt that can farm gold for you, get the stuff you need, and kill your enemies with no-skill level/gear advantage in case you every get in trouble.
---
If you have healing spells then you can heal.
---
Have some spirit and healing gear in the bank for when you join a group or dungeon.
---
Me earlier today. I hate when you're in a group and two people leave because they are done
---
Nah my man, you're just full of shit. No one in their right mind would claim that classic leveling and retail leveling are even remotely the same experience. Dunno what drives you to claim this shit.
---
Lol riparonnies
---
I prefer when asked just saying "Yeah I'm done, I'll stick until you're finished"
---
40 minutes of grinding deviant hides for my unlucky random group member later I was still happy with that choice.
---
Much slower though.
---
So then we can stop holding everything Garithos did against the alliance right?
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
Schools near me (NJ) always start after labor day but they get out middle of June.
---
haha no :D
---
Get fucked.
---
I say it’s worth your time. I had a played time of 30 days before I hit 60 when I first played vanilla but I also was 12 years old
---
All the dps I've played with don't seem to understand threat. Which is fair enough this early but god its frustrating when you wipe.
---
Druids are significantly underpowered in PvP in general for classic. But the one saving grace for them in world PvP is that they are one of the few classes that can basically choose when they want to engage in world PvP or not. Between roots, cheetah, stealth, and HoT / swiftmend a Druid does not have to engage in combat if they don’t want to or feel as if they are at a disadvantage. 
---
You can even be ganked by like 3-4 vs 1 situation and you more then likely can simply just leave by creating space, dropping combat, and then stealthing. A Druid would vastly have to be vastly out leveled by someone for them to get outright killed. Otherwise you can pick and choose your fights and only engage in winnable outcomes.
---
Same here, Whitemane to Blaumeux. Never once looked back! Although I would have liked to try an RPPvP server but I like Blaumeux.
---
This is the exact reason I never got wow until now
---
You're living in a dream if you dont think FFXIV is the top dog MMO currently. The initial launch failed on its own but with it's new director relaunching it. It's currently number 1
---
Beer form tank or bust
---
Making everything else in the game easier.  A major appeal to classic is the sense of accomplishment, because things are challenging.
---
I love how retro this feels

The cycle of life can be cruel.

That's ok I like his reaction vids on YouTube.

Streamers didn't make classic happen. PServers did.

He can play how he wants that is the beauty of Classic.

I don't think his words were disingenuous. You just have to adapt.

[Interview with Hazzikostas about this very thing. Stop complaining and roll on healthy servers.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/08/26/warcraft-classic-layering-and-realm-queues-ion-hazzikostas-explains-why-youre-waiting-to-log-in/#24cc11a57e45)
---
Yeah, but at the same time, there are some other form of achievements in Classic. Getting the full tier 0.5 set is pretty much like an achievement. For me, it would be just another reason to explore zones I would otherwise skip (looking at you, Feralas and Felwood)
---
&gt; He's not playing how I want him to play! wahhhhhhhhhhhh!
---
You are a gatekeeping jackass.
---
Like butter
---
As an average Joe getting camped by another average Joe, yeah itll kinda suck. A streamer being camped by an average Joe? They can practically summon an army on demand I would imagine
---
Is that really being a dick? Its part of the game.

Who in their right mind thought highly of him?

Yeah I honestly thought he’d stick to his guns on that if not just for the pride factor. But no he just shamelessly started accepting shit and just said fuck it
---
That PS really makes the letter.  Wholesome and awesome with that little kick of great humor and truth at the end.  Lol love it.
---
It is also nice to see this because this is what WoW has been missing since cross realm came in.  Thankful to see this kind of thing back in action.
---
thanks! yes it was ironforge
---
Ladder reset just like Diablo 2.
---
I just use the twitch app. 
---
Go to Mods, and get addons there. Use that as an addon manager.
---
To me it comes off as an excuse for not being first. "We weren't even trying kids." excuse.
---
exploit early exploit often
---
I gave in and modded my wow classic and questie and immersion were essentials. May e I'd use storytime as it fits the aesthetic of classic better, but immersion is more useful and impressive.
---
I'm not saying they're the same.  I'm saying that they're both monotonous, but one requires focus because of its speed and the other requires patience because of its tedium.
---
There will be legions of priests in BRM ready to mind control him into the lava.
---
33 year old father of 2.
---
Streamer celebs are like the Kardashians of the gaming community.
---
Things usually start being "challenging" as of lvl 10+ content. That said, a proper group will trivialize most of that challenge unless you do some very dumb things.
---
The game is hardest for leveling when you're picking your quests badly, you're a melee class that's under geared, and you're solo.
---
i dont even have retail installed
---
Great, I somehow always miss out on crap like this.
---
It’s only for raids, run a 5 man and you’re fine.
---
This is an incredibly halarious post simply due to the fact that how he plays the game affects you in no way. Who cares what he does and how he does it on classic, if you're this invested in what a streamer does then unironically you need to go outside and get some perspective.
---
because succubus isnt very good while leveling tbh. on my lock back in vanilla i used voidwalker almost exclusively and got succubus later on for dungeons. people who are trying to level fast would rather spend an hour or 2 questing and get the succubus later on because they wouldnt use it.
---
I'm more than sure server transfers will be a thing in the future
---
Agreed to all suggestions! Also id hope Blizzard wants to convert all retail questing to this format sometime.
---
Madseason is an actual fan of the game
---
Why? Ive found it rather enjoyable.  Maybe its a reppetition thing, I know I can not stand leveling in path of exile, I loath it to the point that I cant even play new leagues and I just stopped playing all together
---
I resubbed 2 weeks early to grab my names on Herod.
---
For literally no reason.
---
I agree, but I think it's folly to think retail can't get back on its feet after BfA, which many people seem to think.
---
I just popped in to see what kind of posts this sub has, and the first one I see is a post shitting on retail and man, that's disheartening.
---
Go to the weapons trainer :)
---
I mean sure  
---
but if you do this you're still a turd lmao
---
cries in stallag
---
I mean, I wasn't arguing against that?
---
Yeah this is hella fucked up now
---
Getting attuned for BWL is the easy part. The hard part is that it's the first raid where you need your whole raid to coordinate with each other, and one weak link can lead to a wipe. That's obviously not going to be a problem for world first guilds, as they are highly coordinated. When the average and below average raid guilds see the bump up in difficulty from MC/Ony to BWL, it's going to be a wake up call for them. MC is a joke in terms of difficulty, and Ony is very straightforward and is usually only difficult when you get bad RNG with the deep breaths.
---
Found myself doing exactly that to Esfand on the beta, and when I realized it I immediately fucked off to somewhere else entirely and felt bad about myself for a while.  The temptation to stream snipe when you see that you're close to them already is super real, and I don't think they're ever going to escape that.  Why they all rolled on a PVP server is just completely beyond me.
---
I dont have a problem with retail players in general, i might even check out the next expansion if it looks sufficiently good enough, but i *do* have a problen with a certain tyoe of retail player. The kind that wants classic to fail, and if they do play classic they play it with a strictly retail mentality. Not making retail mistakes mind you (lord knows ive done those. Pro tip to any future rogues out there, sap breaks stealth. I learned the hard way) but coming at classic with the same mentality they have for retail and then not changing it when it clearly doesnt work.
---
The toxic retail mentality is slowly seeping into classic.
---
“the aspect of someone's character that is presented to or perceived by others.” It’s his persona.
---
I don't know what you expected from that manchild, but he complains endlessly about retail and tries to play other games and ends up fucking it up because of having zero attention span and not wanting to put any effort in. He wants to have his cake and eat it too
---
It's impossible to level cooking without it, and food buffs are serious business.  And yes you can find items/potions by fishing in junk pools.
---
Those will be worth some money eventually. I snagged a sentry cloak from ah the other day for 1g. The guy selling probably had no idea.
---
"A dipshit move". You take it too seriously man, it's a video game.
---
Go PvE and a lot of fun events are taken off the cards when you get to 60. The leveling experience is a very small part of Classic for a lot of these people, so to wreck their experience for the next couple of years because a couple of angry people on Reddit might not approve of something is stupid.
---
It's not about being "scared", it's about not even being able to level. I've played on private servers with big populations where certain areas are impossible to quest in because of the ganking. If people were actually out to gank me on a personal level it would just make that 10x worse.
---
There's too many idiots who have this idea of the "classic experience" like they're some higher power who dictate what that is. This is an MMO, there is no "right" way to play it.
---
They wont. But I agree.
---
Currently I have tailoring and herbalism. I'm happy to keep tailoring but I may switch herb to engi or enchanting. Is enchanting any good in classic? Will it be useful for my friends?
---
He has 100k+ viewers a day. The things he does literally set the tone for the game. He's the reason everyone was doing ten man SM.
---
I'm sorry, but I disagree. I dislike this whole idea that people should "experience how classic is meant to be played". I don't support group finder, but this game is going to be played differently by a lot of people than how it was played back in the day. People can and should play the game the way they want to. If people want to farm 10 man, let them do it. If they want to quest their way to 60, let them do it. A streamer's "influence" doesn't affect the vast majority of a server's population, aside from their fanbases being annoying.
---
I agree some sort of action needs to be taken , you get banned on retail for something a lot less than this
---
I did a few.  You don't really tank.  You pull and group without dying and everything gets cleaved/aoed, preferably while massively slowed by a frost mage. 
---
It was boring, so I did 5 mans instead... which were far better experience anyway.  People 10 manning this were doing it wrong to begin with.
---
BFA was really fun for its first week I think. When all the progression was fresh, but after I hit max level it started becoming a chore.
---
Classic appeals to me because that feeling of progression I got within the first week of BFA is continued through the entire leveling process.
---
You cleaned your room...it took a video game to maintain somewhat of cleanliness and hygiene? What a sad world life you are living lmao.
---
Like you said it's just getting more attention this time because of social media type outlets or streams.  People didn't have the connections to prepare to level 40 people minimum as fast as possible and also all the quest information wasn't known so of course it would be lightning fast this time.  It's a little offputting but still expected.
---
that is not account sharing
---
Hey, xp is xp!
---
except for everything they already touched?
---
Ok. So me and my gf went through this last night. We found that she had started to download the game but hit play before it finished. It kept her at the back of the queue. We closed the game out and let the download finish. Then she had no problems progressing in queue.
---
Don't be a troll if they were that optimal they would do the research themselves, stop assuming I don't know what it talking about. Plenty of videos out there I myself have enjoyed lock since 2004 all the way up to retail
---
First if you haven't decided what to play by now chances are the person won't even stick with the character
---
Reroll syndrome. I did answer the question
---
LFG is an official channel isn't it? And by world I thought he meant general chat. Sorry!
---
it does bc they're the ones that influence the culture of the game, whether u like it or not  
---
Hundreds of thousands of people watch them and will copy what they do
---
People like to heap shit onto Retail, and much of it is deserved, but it remains one of the best MMOs, even at its lowest point. And I think it's silly that people think WoW can't bounce back.
---
To many, Legion was one such bounce. It's not a unanimously loved expansion, but it had its audience, and it wasn't small.
---
I'm glad we have Classic now, and I'm curious to see what Blizzard's plans are for what comes after. Will they follow the expansions? Unlikely. Will they release new content? To me, that seems equally unlikely, because they won't want to leave out the Retail crowd.
---
Maybe they'll leave it in Vanilla forever, but I doubt that's the case too. In any case, I am excited to see what's in the future for both versions of WoW.
---
&gt;Streamers influence the behavior of tons of other people and it has huge ramifications across the game
---
Okay, Im waiting in stormwind by the bank mailbox. Anyone who want to trade me gold, feel free. Also accepting in mail. Need that epic mount.
---
There nothing better than a dwarf. I will concede undead is pretty sweet.
---
Did I miss something? What happened?
---
I love Ashenvale’s aesthetic, but on my server it’s got so many Horde gankers that the lower levels are a nightmare there
---
But we moved to the newest realm the time the realms opened in us east, which was incedius. There wasn’t a newer one for hours, but we were all logged in at that point. We didn’t realize it there was many hour queues until the following day when 6+ servers had been opened.
---
What's harder is getting all those people together.
---
Im confused by your comment.  You say you spent most of your time doing BGs, yet they aren't even coming till Phase 3.  So what's the rush?  You get to 60, gear up a bit, then come back on this sub and complain that Classic doesn't have enough to do?
---
.!. never
---
Idk I’m around 170 fishing no issues. Cooking over 200.
---
I got lost in Ashenvale for a good 16 minutes...damn music! ;)
---
I ended up in a server that has my local time too so... I never see daylight hardly in game :( and when I do it’s the sunrise and I’m like oh shit I need to go to bed lmao
---
Have you found his channel where he just talks i dont think you did. He's a normal guy man. This post is crazy how some streamer some people enjoy playing a game some way effects some people
---
&gt; You are in the starter zone it is intentionally easier. 
---
It wasn't.
---
Will be expensive and someone will always have enchants. Best to have an alt to disenchant stuff unless you go all in and plan to farm rare enchants to make money. 
---
Otherwise it’s useful to de drops in instances no one needs and roll for the result. That’s the only benefit.
---
What? You think it’s indicative that players from the most successful raiding guild in WoW history tried really hard in the wow classic race because they.... played hard...
---
I doubt they even know how to play the game casually. And the date matters because people are saying, “claiming after the fact is sad” when it’s not “after” the fact.
---
you know what asmongold fans and haters have in common? they both watch the stream.
---
OK dude, relax there lmfao. No one should be banned for this "abuse". It didn't even give that much exp. I did like, 3 runs total of it and it didn't feel worth doing at all.
---
"Vanilla wow was about the journey, not the destination" That line that's constantly brought up whenever someone talked about how shitty endgame vanilla was.
---
So we back in the mine
---
The early bird gets the worm.
---
Good thing it's fixed since that's not how it worked originally, but people will just move to 5 man groups and live in dungeons. It's faster than questing by a large margin.
---
TLDR:
---
Pre Naxx: Mage
---
Naxx: Lock
---
Reason Mages do more damage early is because Locks have to pull their DPS because of threat issues in early raids, and the fact that Locks have insane scaling and with gear get to be the best single target DPS in the game, but their base damage without gear is kinda meh
---
In Naxx when threat is less of an issue and they get to go all out, their damage is higher than mages. The only mage it won't top is the mage with the rolling ignite, but that's just 1 mage in the raid
---
Conclusion:
---
Other than the ignite buff that only one mage can get, the average Naxx lock will do more damage than your avg Naxx mage
---
Prior to Naxx, the average mage will do more damage than your average lock
---
Then you become the microtransaction
---
The exp bug wasn’t in original. It’s a new bug.
---
Flametongue does identical damage and magic ignores armor. Plus you have two different attacks each with a chance to crit
---
This sub has some of the most miserable, spiteful people on the internet in it.
---
I don't even know how i reach level 30 with my mage leveling super slow and helping other people.
---
No problem at all. I hope you two have a lot of fun playing the best game in the world. Many laughs and happy adventures ahead of you guys.
---
Nice! I'm only level 14... 😔 ill blame it on life stuffs and being a paladin.😉
---
It's an MMO lite. Even Bungie refer to it as such now, though they didn't when they were still under Activision, for some reason. Perhaps they weren't allowed to market it as such.
---
But you can't find a true MMO experience in it, no.
---
No it isn't. The people who watch him steamroll SM aren't on Faerlina, they're on every server. They see it, see how easy it is, then try to go do it on their own server   
---
Source: theres a fuckload of these things on skeram every day 
---
or there was
---
Play what you want ... people will come and go.
---
Sure maybe if you're alone, but it *is* hard when you already have friends/guildmates playing on the server.
---
Hold onto it until BGs come out
---
The principle that he hates them?
---
You will need a modifier for each form or a separate macro for each
---
Terrible for pulling; by the time your tank is actually tanking a 5 man they will have a ranged weapon...
---
If Blizzard did not give any warning to not use it then I don't think people should be punished for something left in the game.
---
Docken, Skarm, even Monkeynews.
---
For?
---
30 day ban is a little much. Maybe just a roll back
---
I switched to warlock because of this
---
&gt; Why should I continue the grind to 60 if there's no challenge?
---
Are you actually seeing this as a simple grind? No enjoyment besides that? All you're looking to get out of this is PvE challenge? There's honestly no reason to keep playing. That's not what vanilla is. What they did here is impressive, but it's impressive because of the dedication and speed they did it with. Mechanically, all of this is incredibly simplistic. 
---
If you're not (which by the sound of it you're not) part of the small percentages of speedrunners out there, Vanilla is all about the journey. Enjoy the world, make friends while questing etc. Do you have fun doing that? Great, you'll love it. Do you find that all meaningless fluff on the way to 60 where supposedly challenge and endgame awaits? Probably not the right mentality for this game. 
---
PvP is a little bit of a different story, obviously there's a lot more mechanical complexity based on how skilled your opponents are but that kind of premade experience won't happen until phase 3.
---
Money Management simply doesn't work as a streamer. 
---
Do you think streamers posting their Greens on the AH that are instantly bought up by viewers is cheating? That's one of the most important ways of making money while leveling and they simply don't have options like this.
---
i can smell the teenage angst off this post
---
The irony is that u thought he wouldn't.
---
U are a fool!
---
I'd ppl give u stuff for free u will take it dont tell me otherwise.
---
I love watching him abuse his followers. It is fun and entertaining.
---
Long live the King!!
---
I know I would! Would camp his ass
---
Ye wait on it a while and make bank when the AH doesn’t have any
---
Others may have downvoted because it was a shit joke, I'll admit far from my best

But you didn't realize it was a joke at all. You know it, I know it, and we're the only two people who are ever going to look at this comment chain.

Have a nice labor day

Druid can be tank or healer depending on how you spec it should be fine. Beside lvl 15 is like 3-5 hours worth of play depending on class. Just get them to level up whatever you want to play
---
The people that got the xp from 10 man grinding probably didn’t know it was a bug, and they would be justifiably upset if blizzard reset their progress.
---
Just make a misfit group with a druid tank, shaman healer and "offbeat" dps
---
Yall just mad you dont have slaves
---
You don't have to know anything. People in 2004 knew nothing and it became the most popular MMO of all time. 
---
Pick a race and class that you want. 
---
The playerbase is split between two factions. Horde and alliance are enemies. You can't speak to each other, help each other or anything. If you're flagged for PvP or on a PvP server then you can attack each other.
---
&gt; ...Only to do the same exact things and behave the same way you do on retail 
---
Wait why is he popular then? I really dont watch Asmongold that often and I see his videos on youtube. But if he begs like that in retail why is he popular? Also if he like that in retail were you really all that surprised?
---

Was thinking a (possibly regional) W.I.P./polling interest.

Yep, I'm using them both as we speak!
---
This whole event made METHOD and this event  look like a big bag of failure. 
---
They got dunked by EU APES.
---
Yea fuck Method for trying to get world first right? I dont get this kind of thinking. Why are people so upset that Method was trying? Other guilds were also trying.
---
And here I am killing dwarves in hillsbrad and wasting time.
---
is it a global random from fishing?
---
then don't roll on faerlina? wtf?
---
Source? Unoptimised 5 man dungeons in beta were doing 50-60xp/hr grinding SM. Have you got any twitch vids or screenies of anyone doing 150,000 xp/hour at level 40?
---
Thanks, I must have downloaded a dud as mine aren’t working.

Honestly fuck this guy he is a literally goblin leech idiot

A while back I was playing FF14 daily. Even got myself a house on a busy server (was about ready to quit life during that process). The netcode is by far the biggest turn-off of that game.
---
I love it to bits, but it has many problems, and the netcode almost completely turned me away a few times.
---
It really ain't that deep
---
I have yet to hit a queue idk what the deal is for other people
---
Based on the local chat, tanks are in dire need. If I were to re roll that's what I'd do.... if that helps at all.
---
save  👏 for 👏 your 👏 mount
---
Yea most the powerlevelers did groups of 5 or 6 with warrior/priest/mage/warlock/pally
---
How'd this go for you?
---
Man I'm just trying to have a good time on Reddit. ( I dont know how I hope to get that ) But I come on here and all I see is this post about Asmongold " failed " classic. I didnt like Asmongold originally, I kinda thought he was annoying but I was only in the stream for maybe 10-15 mins so I said " I'm going to give this guy some more time so I can actually see what he's all about " and sure enough he is one of my favorite ( if not the best ) streamer I've ever watched. But all you people on the /r/classicwow do is complain, and you guys also said " This wont be retail anymore " fuck this is what you guys do on the /r/wow subreddit too. I don't personally see what makes you people this angry about someone on the internet, but honestly you need to like settle down and drink some water. Cool yourself down a bit before you type your comments like " Oh my god fuck that guy hahaha " its genuinely childish.
---
Hunter will have the easiest time after 10. Just do all the quests you see it should mostly guide you where to go. If you don’t know where to go next google “leveling guide” and go where it says to
---
Feral Tank that carries an up-to-date Resto set just in case. I need all the water I can get if I gotta start healing.
---
It just makes it easier to get done if you have 4-5 aoe classes. It‘s not more XP per hour. Many times a 5 man and a 10 man both can spell cleave dungeons on cooldown. The 10 man just gets less XP per dungeon than the 5 man.
---
Haha, thanks man - figure of speech, but I was pretty tilted the other day when I ressed and got killed before I could spawn my pet! It's all a part of the experience though, right? :D
---
I heard there was a bug that showed the total number in queue rather than your position
---
Yea. I had this happen in tbc.
---
Whatever makes you feel better about yourself dude. Cheers from across the pond.
---
Doesn't look like you have nameplates enabled on Elv
---
Assuming they go the route of classic TBC/WotLK, we are likely years off from the first step. I’d assume they want us to enjoy classic first. 
---
There’s also talk of Classic+ which would be expanding on Classic instead of moving to a classic TBC.
---
I fucking love Dan.
---
You can macro all of the spells and they’ll always the use highest rank. 
---
    /cast [spell]
---
To be fair, they did exactly this with the XP potion. If I recall, Asmongold actually lost his invite to the influencer conference over exactly that.
---
yeah im almost sure its tracking inputs now. if you havent hit more than the same button in so long you get kicked. i tried an autoclicker twice to run in place, and always came back to the log in screen.
---
Are you mentally challenged? You should easily be able to keep track of using shift and ctrl modifiers.

we're in the same guild :D

Thanks, I enjoyed my twink 19 Warrior back then and totally plan on bringing him back.
---
I've never seen this infomercial, does someone want to tell me what happens?
---
People griding to end game are ruining the game for themselves. 2 raids aint worth 6 months of boredom woth no content once they're completed
---
&gt; Imagine waiting 12 years for classic wow only to spend it inside a dungeon for over half the levelling experience.
---
Streamers: Classic WoW is massively superior to BfA because the world feels huge and immersive, and you actually have to travel places!
---
Also streamers: *farming Scarlet Monastery all day*
---
I don’t get why people watch asmongold, he’s a narcissistic ass hole who thinks everyone but him is a dumbass and doesn’t know shit, he’s Gods gift to humanity and anyone who doesn’t worship his word as gospel is living in a fantasy land. Do yourself a favor and never turn his shit on again.
---
I really hope Retail is taking notes. Many things Classic does can not ever work again in Retail, but there are still things they can learn from Classic to make sure Retail never drops this low again.
---
Go to dark shore friend, the journey is a quest on it's own.   I went from Westfall to dark shore today but kept my hearthstone on stormwind, just in case.
---
yeah hes shit
---
So like...just playing the game normally? Good for them
---
Thanks for your input. Those binding seem very practical, will give them a shot.
---
some did stream leveling, but MN said that "people didnt know how to level properly so we went off stream to help them before MC", which is why not everyone was 60 and the MC raid was full of mid 50s.
---
Almost any online game you play if you use and abuse an exploit your getting punished what can you not understand about that ? If someone used an exploit to get 1000g but only got epic mount with it and then Defended themselves saying “I only got a mount it doesn’t effect you” should he not be punished ?
---
Aw did I hurt your feelings buddy, I’m so sorry. It must be rough not understanding the basic usage of the English language.
---
He lost all honor and is as dead...
---
It's not a change. It was a bug.
---
I just grind mobs for some levels instead of trying to complete every quest in the game lol that shit is too tricky for me
---
So it doesn’t effect you right now!!?
---
Nothing. Don’t worry about it. It doesn’t matter at all. People just thrive on drama.
---
I was 28 when I started playing in 2004.  The comments here make me proud of the youth.
---
Good reminder, I'd forgotten that as well, but that doesn't help with using inventory items.
---
In terms of actual combat you are not using 20+ different abilities in any regular fashion. Some consistently use just one for entire boss pulls. I dont' think it's arguable at all that Retail has more dynamic combat across the board, especially if you're a Frost Mage, Ret Paladin, or Enh Shaman. 
---
What Classic has is more flavor abilities, things that give a class identity, which round out a class and give options. Which is what I prefer personally, and gives a better overall experience. What they have even more of is class-wide abilities -- abilities from other specs but you still get. In some cases it doesn't matter (mage), in some it makes the class more dynamic (warrior stance dancing, weapon swapping for defensive stance mid-combat). But it's not universally better, by a longshot.
---
I’m shocked how good the game looks at ultra.
---
I HIGHLY recommend you get a mod called immersion. It makes reading the quests much better.
---
Fuck who cares. Just play the game.
---
That makes sense and if everyone's ignoring the bears there will be a ton and no boars
---
Now kith
---
Oh shit hahaha. Yep I remember this now.
---
There's a yeti cave in Arathi that's good to aoe farm, level 30-31ish. Shimmering Flats in 10K Needles is good for grinding.
---
Just try to imagine, that people, even a big amount of people can just be wrong.   
---
I know its hard but, maybe... just maybe... try it. :)
---
People who talked about dungeons being in hard in vanilla have been wrong the entire time. They weren't hard, we were bad and didn't have the level of knowledge we have now.
---
Does quest experience degrade at higher levels the same way mob experience does? Cause if not, this is probably the most efficient way of doing things. Not to mention the most... satisfying... hnnng...
---
Oh god I just made my gamer room look like fucking winterspring
---
My wife is doing something similar. She just found her uncle isn't doing well and has been using classic as a distraction.
---
\&gt; Allowing other people to level a little faster does not prevent you from experiencing WoW as it was. 
---
Yes, it does, classic players are also against being able to buy level boosts, the point of going back to classic was to go back to classic. It is a bug, that isn't supposed to be there and has an impact on the game.
---
Layering. Its how blizzard dealt with the huge influx of new players in the starting zones. Its basically many different servers on one server and when your friend invites you to party you join their server and leave the one you were on allowing people to farm faster .
---
Rollbacks imo. Unfair advantage due to abused game mechanics.
---
This is what I ended up using, works great:
---
\#showtooltip Polymorph
---
/script SetRaidTarget ("mouseover",5)
---
/cast Polymorph
---
You don't know for sure it will be the only populated rpvp server.
---
&gt; when running away from mobs mobs they start to daze you
---
That's why you strafe-run... AKA run and strafe at the same time. That makes it harder for mobs to get a hit on you from the back and daze you.
---
Layers
---
yes they did? they even said they realized how OP it was fairly late but still did it from like 45 to 60. all last night they were powerleveling people in BRS 10 man.
---
&gt;I bought you dinner why won't you have sex with me?
---
\-OP
---
This is not the greatest game in the world no,
---
This is just WoW Classic!
---
Couldn’t redownload the greatest game in the world no, no.
---
This is WoW Classic!
---
A lot of Gorillaz songs go really well with leveling.
---
Alright, but let's face it: As long as he streams his experience he is never going to have a classic experience. There are simply too many people who follow him around. If he ever wants to "go back", he will have to do so off stream, on a new account, with a name no one will realize. He has to dungeon-spam SM because if he's level normally, there would be spergs following him around, tagging mobs, there would be horde ganking him non-stop and doing all of this while talking to the stream is extremely difficult. 
---
Saying that Asmongold failed classic WoW is not only rude but it's false. He moved tens if not hundreds of thousands of players through Twitch and YouTube to understand what classic is all about. He is a large part of why it happened in the first place. The real disgrace here is you, trying to tell him how to play his game. Even more so, you trying to tell him to play the game in a way that he knows won't work.
---
Many people just like to worry about how other people like to play the game instead of thinking about themselves. An example is the streamer thread on the front page. Doesn’t affect the people complaining at all, but they have to say something since that’s not how the way they think someone should enjoy the game. It’s just humans being humans.
---
That 250k viewer twitch money will do that to a person
---
Downvoted by people who don't understand the joke.  But l8 m8 but I r8 8/8.
---
I guess so, but Blizzard won't want to fragment the playerbase too much. If they add TBC/progression servers on top of the Classic servers, the Classic servers will start shrinking again.
---
So I'm still curious, because there are upsides and downsides to every option.
---
**TIL YOU DIE**
---
Don’t tell them our secret.
---
Yaaay
---
Just got my aspect. This is exactly how I’m running around
---
respect the content lol, sounds like ffxiv to me
---
I hope they ban all those who abused it. the same way they banned people in bfa
---
'Twas a joke (I think)
---
It's actually the logical way to play because it's more profitable to be higher level.  Mobs drop more silver, better items, and you can gather better stuff.
---
This reminds me of the heaven n hell representatives scene from preacher.... alliance being Hitler of course
---
Absolutely do not "spam" flash heal if you're good on mana. That's how you very quickly become NOT good on mana. Use renew to top people up, use Heal as your standard healing spell (you can even downrank it to be more efficient), and use flash heal only when shit is starting to hit the fan.
---
This is fake. Was probably a mistake. 
---
 They deleted this Facebook post.
---
Also no posts from Blizzard NA. Since when companies make major announcements such this one on a Sunday evening.
---
So basically all the steamers got to benefit from the "bug" and now everyone else will have to level the hard way? Sweet, it's not like streamers didn't already get to play the game on easy mode....
---
If there's really an emergency when somebody's hp bar is at the bottom, maybe you should shield him up first, then a flash heal following a renew or greater heal.
---
Wow was the mmorpg king for long time because the lore and world building is so amazing. Slowly tho the forgot this and completely focused on mechanics and quality of life aspects to the detriment of the core wow rpg
---
Another good tactic, if it's a large pull and tank is struggling to get everything on him and threat built up...before you drop the heals on him...PW:S yourself, as you are likely to pull aggro on something he didn't have tagged yet.  This will help keep you alive and uninterupted as you keep him alive.
---
FF14 players are less stuck up than the majority of this sub, cuz at least they admit the original version of their game had problems and need improvements.
---
I was fine with dailies as they were mostly optional and always out of the way in their own little part of the map. Every now and then you got a BiS piece locked behind an exalted rep grind but for the most part it was just stuff like awesome mounts (MoP's cloud serpents and water striders spring to mind), fun little toys or profession recipes. You never felt like you were punished for missing a day, you just didn't get rewarded. It wasn't expected for you to max out every faction every day but you could if you had the time. 
---
But then Legion added world quests and holy shit do I hate those things. The emissary chests mean it's practically mandatory to log in day or two if you don't want to lose out on a legendary item or mount roll. They're all over your map but hey, at least you can hide them and ignore them, right? Not really because they're automatically accepted and you get a voice line as soon as you accidentally wander into range of it. It's such an "in your face" feature and all it really is is a reskinned daily quest system with a bunch of hooks and a lot less choice. I definitely agree with Classic feeling more "honest".
---
The dude is a complete asshole and one of the most toxic people I've ever seen. I avoid that douche bag at all costs.
---
What zone are ya In NA there is grobbulus and deviate delight for rppvp
---
Who’s Asswantsgold?
---
lol, I was there when we made the decision to allow SOME gnlmes. I was also there when we decided no knife ears ever loool.
---
I didn’t read past clean my room so I don’t know much of the context. Pointless post that isn’t labeled humor so yeah.
---
Except it's not because that's not what they want to be able to do. It's what a bunch of 5heads on the WoW subreddit who have a massive hate boner for streamers think they think.
---
Casual is about the content you enjoy, not the time you have to play.
---
Is that a cross
---
Also, heal enjoys 100% benefit from +heal bonus from your gears, whereas flash heal only enjoys half due to shorter casting time.
---
Well I'm probably gonna use this on a Zandalari Paladin (whenever I take the time to unlock them) just so I don't have to go from 20-110. Won't make me want to play it much but hey, free level 110 I'll take it.
---
Kinda - it's a little hard to say for gear that isn't far and away the best you can get. It's hard to determine because something that takes you 2 levels to farm in scarlet monastery might not have been as good as just getting a more gradual upgrade 2 levels ago, right? 
---
Best thing to do is pull up a list of the instances, check out the drops relevant to your character, and try and get them at or before the required level. If you get them later, cool, but don't get bogged down hunting a 19 blue when a 22 green will do.
---
I would say frost for aoe if you can handle it. If you like single target pulls fire is the way to go. Also respec is 1g for first 5 for second and goes up after that, no penalty tho
---
I haven’t been to the Jaguars yet, but I did notice that greys don’t seem to drop as often as on private servers so far.
---
You lot are acting like this is some advanced technique that doubles questing XP per hour, it's the same XP per hour as 5 manning it just without the need for everyone to know what they're doing.
---
If you really want to dungeon level just find a group of 5 that will learn the pulls, the lure spots, etc and it's still 50k an hour.
---
God damn this is a gut rip.
---
Can't wait for him to read it on stream and pretend to not care.
---
*Mrrglrlrlrmgrrr!*
---
Who should be rolled back though? Everyone? People like me who only did 3 runs? People who hit 60 off of it?
---
Found this on Yojamba. Just get an invite from someone on another layer. Fixes it for me.
---
Apparently there was a bug in xp calculations in groups of 6 or more. The groups where getting more xp then intended for a group of that size. There was a hotfix just a bit ago to bring it back down.
---
The cleave leveling groups speeding to 60 where using this method, including the guild Method, the guild that just got the Rag and Onxy kill, and most streamers.
---
There was no abuse.  Nobody even knew this was a bug.  Blizzard should not ban anyone.  It’s blizzard’s fuck up anyway, no reason to punish paying customers.
---
Perks for being an intellectual
---
If you’re in a pvp world and you want to go after em, go for it. If not, just run by lol
---
&gt;have them rezed after
---
Or if they pissed the healer off bad enough, make them run back :p
---
Those loading screens really make other MMO worlds feel small.
---
What chat mod?
---
WoW feels smoother when you have a good connection but worse when you have an unstable one imo.
---
Some folks also use it as an affirmative now. replacing "yeah" or "yes"
---
&gt; Anyone doing this should have known it was bugged if they played in Vanilla. Nobody did dungeon raids because it gave 0 XP.
---
How many people even did dungeon raids in vanilla? I don't think I ever did, ubrs doesn't count
---
When I hit 40 I will be able to get an rare mount mainly cause I am good at money management and am selling stuff on the AH at a reasonable rate that I shouldn't have a problem.  But I can't bring myself to ask for hand outs in a game where this is a journey that we make for ourselves; if we ask for hand outs what sort of shitty journey is that going to be?
---
everything is free game... except druid vs druid, just /spit and turn around.
---
Humans made the game so #humanmasterrace
---
Oh an asmongold hate thread? I thought this was the WoW forums for a minute.
---
I’m not sure why this kind of post is allowed about any player or streamer, nothing good will ever come from it.
---
Nvm I found out. ChatlinkIcons for anybody whose wondering.
---
The raids and dungeons are less mechanically complex in classic, but everything else is undeniably harder. Raiding wasn't the focus back then like it is now. It was just a side thing you did with your guild so you could get epics to stomp kids in WSG.
---
Do as you please. Right now everyone is leveling so the rush to 60 has folks ignoring PvP a lot at the moment.
---
You fuckin baby.
---
play what you feel like, dont let other players population sizes dictate to you what you find fun.
---
I've missed my target a few times, too many people even at 45+.
---
Shout-out to all you pirate farming lads who aren't abusing bugs.
---
The honor system isn't in place yet. 
---
There's no reward for killing the enemy faction. You will eventually get honor for killing enemies around your level.
---
It's not, he's always been toxic in his own ways, before streaming and before youtube
---
Ya my Shaman only got better at like 35.
---
This is spot on. Flying and dailies.
---
Guessing the same guys who want to make a big debate of the world first level 60. May as well take advantage of game mechanic
---
It's not bad etiquette, it's a pvp server, that's the point of them. I personally don't mess with anyone but if I see some dude attacking my faction then I'm gonna join in. 
---
Basically, if you wanna fuck everyone up, you do you.
---
I personally believe that Asmongold is someone who 90% of the time speaks out of his ass and his twitch chat is literally people just spamming shit in caps all the time, wich is either "TRUE", "NO", "YOU ARE STUPID" or Pepe emotes
---
I don't know how he got so popular tbh
---
Dude who the fuck cares, holy shit get a life
---
Here you go [classic alchemy](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Classic_alchemy_recipes)
---
They gave away level free 80 boosts either in or just before cata. I don't remember the reason we got them, I just know I had about 3 or 4 for some reason. I still have my boosted 80's mostly untouched all these years.
---
Blizzard gave us the sword of a thousand truths :)
---
Thanks brah!
---
I prefer the Warlock method where you are turning healer mana into your own mana.
---
Underrated area fo sho.
---
Yes.
---
By chance did you play Argent Dawn (RP) Vanilla? Interested in your name frand.
---
Working as intended
---
sigh now they fix this after the majority abuse this/layering to get level 60 and then proceed to full clear MC / Ony in less than a week.
---
you can do w/e you want but i dont attack people unless they attack me first, for now.
---
dying while questing sucks i'd feel like a dick about it
---
i got baited and bought this garbage on release and now they are giving it for free lmao nice even more wasted money now

If you play a undead rogue on a pvp server, yes.
---
Just downloaded it to see, and I can confirm it works for classic
---
I don’t miss those parties.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's clear he really is knowledgeable about lots of the game.  But at times I think he thinks he knows a bit more than he really does lol
---
I've been healing as enhancement. First thing I do is replace max rank es with rank 1, rebind Earth biter to flame tongue, and always pop down strength of the earth so the tank gets more threat. Super important in groups to help the tank out.
---
Why should anyone care though?
---
the wickerman
---
And the paper is a nice break from the amount of screen I've been looking at lately.
---
All info is from Petopia, hahah.
---
Red = dead
---
Too preachy, and thinks if something isnt viable at 60 pushing top content it's never viable.  So basically only play prot warrior main tank and druid off tank, because nothing matters but naxx.
---
Big surprise... But I enjoy myself so much its hard to give a duck...
---
yes
---
Dead set legend fuckers woulda ate him for sure they straight fucken savage that side of the river

What mod adds loot to the chat?
---
I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my 20 year-old brother in an accident as well, although it was a long time ago.  
---
It probably will take you a long time to move past this, but life goes on.   
---
I'm glad you have the WoW community here for you as you go through this.
---
Adventure time =p
---
&gt; I actually thought I would miss many of the "good features" - LFG, shared mob tagging, heirlooms, etc. But I've started to see how even these have helped destroy much of what makes wow fun.
---
Things like those (and flying, and every class being similarly good at a given role, etc) *sound* like they would make the game objectively better, but have unforeseen consequences.  I may be annoyed that I don't have any aoe heals on my holy paladin, but being bad at one thing (aoe heals) means your class can be the king of something else (single-target healing) without being too wildly imbalanced.
---
There is a practical application for this.  The time you spend running allows others time to do kill quests which relieve pressure on respawns (or lack there of)  Also sewhat making the world seem more alive by seeing people run to and fro.
---
That's because you never got to the hard part. It wasn't the leveling that was supposed to be hardcore, it was the end game content.
---
These people are by far in the minority. Also consider a lot of them could easily be groups doing a dungeon once or twice then leaving. That's what all groups have been doing in my experience.
---
Also not everyone is playing classic for the exact same reasons.
---
The real answer is he wanted easy karma, posting a hate thread/post about asmongold is literally easy attention be it here or forums 
---
OP can say it isn’t, but let’s be honest. This serves literally no actual purpose

warrior.
---
pallies and druids can tank early game content, but warriors are the only late game tank. you can offtank as a feral later on, but it requires some dedication.
---
Dont you mean LEGEND!
---
nice stalk, creep
---
I’ll give you stonecold stunner for it
---
This guy is a scumbag? Shocking news!
---
Who ?
---
It's not that they didn't keep a code repository.  They did.  They said as such.
---
The problem is that if you do a checkout of a code repository from over 15 years ago, you have several problems:
---
1. It's probably not going to build on your modern tools.  Your development tools are all *several* major revisions higher than they were back then.
---
2. It's probably not going to build with your modern libraries.  That old code was built against an old version of the DirectX SDK (and probably a *customized* version of it at that).  It was built against an old Windows SDK.  It was built against old versions of whatever sound and video libraries you used at the time.  Some of those might have modern versions which are passably backward-compatible, some might not.  Some might have their older versions still available online, some might not.
---
3. Your server infrastructure is 15 years older, and isn't the same as it was when the old code was written.  Blizzard moved from pretty static server infrastructure where each realm literally had *it's own* hardware; to their more modern server infrastructure where resources can be allocated around in a cloud-like manner.  They don't have servers that can run the old-style code anymore... and even if they did...
---
4. The code is missing 15 years of bug fixes, including security fixes.  No network operations team worth its salt would allow you to put 15-year-old code online otherwise untouched.
---
5. Oh, and your accounting and billing systems are all 15 years older too.  That old code only supported logging in with WoW accounts.  Nobody has a WoW account anymore; they're all battle.net accounts.  Product entitlements and subscriptions are all handled differently on the back end now.
---
The decision that was made -- to recreate the classic experience on top of their modern codebase using private in-house builds of the old code as a reference only -- was the right one.  Bringing the old code itself up to modern standards would have been an impossibly difficult task.
---
The mentality itself isn't the issue, it's when you change the game to suit it is when it becomes a problem.
---
It's literal evolutionary instinct to find the path of least resistance around an obstacle and to a reward.
---
But it's the slipperiest of slopes as it will never stop no matter how much easier/convenient/etc you make it.
---
But after a certain point, when you make it too easy or too convenient the reward stops being fulfilling or satisfying.
---
Vanilla WoW had a good balance where:
---
1. The baseline was sloggish enough to make the reward fulfilling
---
2. The rewards were good enough to be inherently desirable
---
3. The existing paths of least resistance were inherently fun
---
4. The existing paths of least resistance were not so trivial that it undermined eventual fulfillment.
---
The last 2 days have been nothing but people looking for SM 10 mans in world chat 
---
They're not banning all those players lmao
---
It's been on the decline forever, literally. And it never mattered, and it likely doesn't matter now. Legion brought people back, even BfA had a successful launch, though obviously the numbers are low now.
---
But there's absolutely no indication the next expansion can't raise the numbers again. Millions of paying players is still millions of paying players. They rise, and they fall, and so on.
---
I don't understand why anything lower than the peak concurrent subs is automatically bad.
---
Probably because that's how they enjoy playing the game? Why does it matter?
---
Even though there was eventually 3 PvP servers on launch day, they were added later in the day. Classic did not launch with more than one PvP server. How hard is that to understand?
---
Fine I exaggerated but my point is still valid
---
That's good thinking, thanks!
---
Diremaul pushed it out.
---
I can't believe Shroud is still pulling 25000 viewers as he spams ZF trash clears for XP.  It's fucking pathetic and completely opposite of why people asked for Classic.  If he wants to waste his time doing that, fine, but all these top their streamers are bitching about leveling, items, questing, etc. in Classic because it's tedious, so they want an easy out.
---
Screw all these guys.  I will never donate or subscribe to these sub tier players.
---
Who gives a shit what that guy is doing? It couldn’t matter less. My left nut itched for a second earlier today and that was way more significant of an occurrence than how a stranger chooses to play a video game.
---
Wait LBRS is 5 man. UBRS is 10 man. I thought it was 10/15 for some reason
---
Seen a lot of posts like this but haven't actually seen ingame on OCE servers.
---
wow this is weird. How can you watch the guy for so long and not realise he would do this ?
---
So far in Zandalari tribe EU every alliance assault against crossroads or Orgrimmar has ended in like 5 minutes cuz they are too svared when they see we outnumber them 5 to 1
---
They have also been made by streamers so I guess they expect easy wins or something just to show off
---
na
---
Do we know yet how long it's going to take Blizzard to release each phase?
---
It's vc, there's no debate about it.
---
What server you guys on?
---
lmao
---
&gt;I do want to be fair, most people using this method probably didn't know it was bugged.
---
Some sure, most? No way. You don't get up to a level where that's efficient and constantly being used without paying attention to what's going on.
---
To be fair, I'm not sure I care enough for the drama it would bring. Wow is very much about your journey more than theirs. I guess it might matter as more 60s ding and start ganking though.
---
Are mounts only available at level 40 right now?
---
Ooh I like this, saving this for sure!
---
I did pretty well today. Spammed as a healer/tank but everyone wanted tank.
---
Had 2 SFK, one went amazing one was ok.
---
Had 3 DM...one was a train wreck and two were good.
---
I just wanna heal one stinkin dungeon but there seems to be a lack of tanks. I might just have to change my spec to prot &gt;.&lt;
---
Looks like Prat. Try changing the font to DorisPp. That’s how I roll
---
Apes on Gehennas EU got rag and Onyxia world firsts over 24 hours ago
---
so first it was "it doesnt effect you" now you are backpeddling to "well its only a 7 day advantage"  Freaking ridicolous, just admit it, you are exploiting this and are now doing everything you can to try and fight public opinion that rollbacks should happen for this behavior.
---
fucking disgusting
---
at 22 you can get a sword better than cruel barb from a common quest in ashenvale lol.
---
Ok.  Have fun struggling to level out there for some reason. I dunno maybe read up on some stuff if you’re having trouble.
---
[This one?](https://youtu.be/wwKU26wKW7g?t=40)
---
I've been watching a lot of his streams but since classic been out I can't stand how he's lvling. It's hard to watch. I was getting kinda upset while playing that I wasn't lvling as fast as I wanted to and kinda hating on the game because of it. But I found a lot more enjoyment by slowing down and doing the quests and other stuff just for the fun of it. It's been so long since I played vanilla and I haven't played on private servers so I forgot the game wasn't only about endgame content like it is on retail. It's nice.
---
For context... APES is the name of a guild
---
REEEE NO CHANGES 
---
nah jokes, good change
---
[The Backwards Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtyxJSGM3x0)
---
This does not spark joy.
---
Fucking warlocks.
---
It isn't usually significant, but there's nothing wrong with wanding the tank's target while you're waiting to heal.
---
tl;dr Asmon has consistenly admitted he was a scammer and shitty player back in the early days. If you seriously were expecting an authentic wow experience you should tune into StaySafe or Esfand (who admittedly streamed with asmon at times).  
---
You're expecting better from a guy who has routinely openly bragged about scamming and yoinking rare loot drops back in the day, and had numerous blizz forum posts back in the day that he even went to to expose how shitty a person he was back then? 
---
You're expecting him to be a top caliber player, when he has repeatedly admitted he spent most of his time fucking around back then? 
---
No. By Asmon's own admission/claims of it, this is actually higher caliber play than he did back then. So many think Asmon didn't do the very shit he's consistently been admitting to when he began playing wow act surprised when he's not putting in the grind now?
---
Probably should put in OP to state your server as well
---
Considering someone max leveled in 3 days after launch and all raids have been cleared in within a week after launch
---
Imagine playing horde OMEGALUL
---
What next?
---
World first Texas rogue?
---
Holy shit, I might be world first in my town.
---
get a $25 ikea desk
---
I am literally a network engineer specializing in private cloud (the same solution blizzard uses btw) and SDN/NFV for the largest mobile provider in the United States. 
---
Networking has nothing to do with why these two games can’t be compared either.
---
A maximum efficiency 10 man group that i was in earlier today (6 min cath clear + 6 min arms clear, reset X 5) was 63k per hour, i've done plenty of ~45-50k per hour 5 man cath farms that were in no way maximum efficiency.
---
It was just a way of EZmoding 5 man dungeon cleaving, if you actually know how to do it properly and you're not playing with randoms that add downtime on resets, etc it'll be comparable to pugging 10 mans.
---
The downside is that now to do it we'll be running 3 mages, 1 WL, 1 priest or 4 warrior 1 priest so every other class is locked out unlike before where there were spots for randoms.
---
Boy? How old are you sport?
---
People was banned for 30 days for using an xp potion no one knew it was bugged but they still got banned and not sure if xp reverted
---
I mean you say that and at the same time a bunch of classes have pretty much 1-3 spells max that they just spam from 1-60
---
Then don't stream.  You can't have it both ways.  Tough tits.
---
Some pretty goofy (and unintentionally funny) stuff in the review, looking back, but man you can feel the love I had for the game at release:
---
*A review from a first time MMORPG player*
---
I casually stumbled upon the open beta while surfing the web at work one day. I signed up for an account and waited for the 2.7 gigabyte download to complete (yikes!). I had an expectation about MMORPGs that they were addictive (and thus "wrong"), but I wanted to try one anyway.
---
I customized the look of my character and decided to be a Tauren Hunter (as far as I could tell later on, all the races/classes are meticulously balanced, and ALL can solo!). I then entered the world. The first thing I noticed were little "!" icons on the bottom of my screen giving me help and telling me what to do. Later on they appear less and less and you can turn them off if you want. They (in conjunction with looking at the manual occasionally) were extremely helpful in getting me started. The user interface was very intuitive considering how much it was capable of.
---
My first few quests were easy, fun, and short. As I quested I noticed the game was absolutely beautiful. It had such atmosphere and detail. Blizzard has raised the bar for "big" games. I am used to "big" games meaning "vast tracts of empty land".
---
I leveled up very quickly. I was at level 10 in just a few hours! I noticed this game rewards beginners very well. You start to level slower as you get higher up, but this game continually rewards you. You can be a casual, 2 hours at a time gamer who likes to play by yourself and you will do *just fine* in this game. I never played for an hour stretch during which I did not gain or experience something cool. I introduced my wife to it (she being a very casual gamer) and she likes it so much we're getting a new computer just so we can duo together.
---
The world is very big but travel is rarely a problem. There are dragons and zepellins that are willing to fly you to major locations, as well as a "hearthstone" that transports you to the innkeeper you spoke with last. Later on in the game I hear you can get mounts of your own to ride.
---
The gameplay is very diverse. I never felt bored because there was always an opportunity to go do something I hadn't done before. There are many tradeskills and these tradeskills are also easy to level up. For instance, to max out the fishing tradeskill, it requires about 275 skill points. After 30 minutes of fishing, I had about 30-40 skill points, had caught a bunch of nice fish to eat, and a few nice items too! Perfect for the casual gamer who does not want to spend their whole life playing a single game to master it!
---
Death in this game is handled superbly. You are transported as a ghost to the *nearest* graveyard. In ghost form, everything has a white glow to it (check out the sky!), you can run very fast, and to resurrect all you have to do is find your corpse (helpfully marked on your map). If you died in an extremely bad area that you don't want to revive in, there is a "spirit healer" at the graveyard who can revive you for a slight experience penalty (you will not lose any levels) and 25% item durability penalty (a mere token of money to repair). Your corpse cannot be looted or exploited in any way. The game makes sure you don't actually want to die, because it can take 2-3 minutes to get to your corpse, but otherwise prevents you from being frustrated.
---
All enemies are helpfully marked with a name and the level they are next to them, so you don't accidently try and take on a level 21 Kodo Barrens Beast when you're only level 11. Also, if an enemy is enormously strong for its level, it will be marked as "elite", as in a "Level 21 Elite" Kodo Barrens Beast. Watch out for elites! :-)
---
The game is in "real-time" depending on your time zone so if you only play the game at night, it will always be night in the game. This can be good or bad. I personally loved it. I would get up early in the morning to play the game so I could watch the sunrise. And then in the evenings I might play to watch the sunset.
---
My system is an Athlon XP 2200+, 768 megs of ram, and an ATi Radeon 9200 videocard. The game ran very smooth at medium detail and only slightly stuttery on the highest detail settings. If you have an ATI 9000+ videocard (or 5200+, for those with nVidia Geforce cards), your main bottleneck will be your RAM. The official requirement is 256 megs. I played with this much before I bought a 512 stick. If you have 256 megs you have to turn down all your detail settings and avoid crowds of people because otherwise your computer will constantly be loading textures from the hard drive. With 768 megs of ram the game runs seamlessly and there is no great noticeable loading of anything anywhere! It's all one big world (except for major dungeons, which load separately).
---
The game mentioned it had "dynamic weather" but I did not notice any in the areas I played. I did not notice the absence until someone else mentioned it. Perhaps it was turned off for beta purposes. The game was sunny everywhere I went, although sometimes with fog or partial clouds.
---
Overall, one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. It looks like Blizzard has another game of the year on their hands. See you there!
---
Any good wow classic phone apps you reccommend?
---
I would read the quests if the font size wasn't like 3px
---
Leave it. That guy is just salty that he couldnt take advantage of it.
---
So cool.  Is there a particular guild that ran this event?
---
Who says there wouldn't be new content? Classic+ could easily go into an alternate timeline, or it could add a reimagined TBC/ WotLK/ Cata etc. Or it could just add TBC content with Classic+ gameplay.
---
Good reaction time Blizz. Puts a bit of an asterisk on the current world firsts.
---
I played way back when. I also played on private servers. I'm also pushing mid 30's right now. Classic/Vanilla punishes solo players heavily. Sure you can do whatever you want, but doing thing's solo takes an unnecessarily long time, and many classes are so bad at it they're basically forced to group up or farm weak content or make literally 1/3rd or less the progress of other players.
---
This conversation started because I said players shouldn't be forced to group up and everyone responded to me telling me why they SHOULD be forced to group up. There's no place here insisting that's not the case in Classic, that's a separate conversation.
---
Ya, this was already happening to the world record holder run. So many people were trying to streamsnipe.
---
sounds like he sucks but you also fucking suck for writing this lame ass rant to some streamer tf is wrong ith you just play the game
---
Because it's fun?
---
Go back to fortnite young one this one is for those with a developed pallet it's like a fine wine.
---
Too sensational. Needs more subtlety.
---
No.
---
I've been told that there's going to be inflation. I'm just going to wait to sell them anyway. Someone was pestering me the other day trying to offer 1g, I was insulted.
---
bUt AsMonGoLd Is A pVp GoD, hE'lL dO GrEaT oN a PvP ReAlM.
---
so people who took advantage of this get to keep the exp? more streamer favoritism i gues
---
 It's a dumb joke, and it's one that people constantly give as (mostly) serious advice. 
---
&gt;Once you get to a higher level dungeon, the danger of the healer going oom is greater. Particularly when things go pear shaped, which usually happens at some point.
---
I've tanked through Naxx in actual Vanilla and healed though BWL. I'm aware of the dungeons. 
---
And my point is the same, if I've got 3/4 mana, you should stop wasting time and hurry up and pull. 
---
You should be pulling by the time the current mob is at 20%, just leave it to the DPS to finish off and go get the next pull. 
---
If I need mana, I'll drink. 
---
You should only be stopping if healer mana gets critically low, or if it's a big/serious pull.
---
Disgusting
---
I was having this problem last night in SFK, I had those nameplates on and I couldn’t see shit in that instance with all the hallways, I was trying to turn them off or use ElvUI ones but I was having trouble doing that.
---
People disliking/hating you doesn't mean that they're persecuting you, though?
---
I never even implied that anyone was persecuting anyone else. Just that a lot of the people over at /r/wow seem to hate classic wow and classic wow players.
---
PvP mostly, from all facets of WoW the challenge in PvE has always been coordination. Whilst there's obviously individual execution, the defining factor in PvE is making sure your entire team executes the script
---
Well I mean, it saves a click every single engagement so. God vorbid people want to make something slightly more convenient on a thread about making things more convenient huh.
---
They'll clear all the endgame content within 2 weeks. PvP becomes the entire game at that point, so being able to world PvP while BGs aren't out yet is a big deal.
---
Yep. Super glad that my friends played in '04 and rolled tanks and healers for Classic.
---
There's 4 of us, so we do pretty much we do whatever we want and grab some rando for dungeons
---
Doesn't stop the reddit circlejerk from treating Apes as if they represent the majority of Classic players.
---
A giant lower case T for "Time to leave"
---
I meant that I have only 10-20 hours a week to play, so can I actually successfully open world PVP and get sick gear?
---
Yeah, but he's also a TD-type idiot so not worth the trouble
---
I think this is the approach I need to have. I was playing a warrior to tank for my buddies but its too painful. I rolled a warlock and Im having a blast playing what I want, how I want.
---
It's a videogame dude
---
Your review is a wall of text. Holy hell you could have been so much more concise.  Thanks for wasting my time with your shit post.
---
Shaman Tank exists as a niche for a reason
---
You guys have abilities that make you functionally capable of tanking, but not optimally capable
---
little too late
---
Mage is best burst damage in the game, lock does the most stable prolounged damage. If you want damage though fury warrior is king.
---
The whole reason people wanted classic??????
---
What is YOUR sack of shit comment?
---
You should find something positive in your life to obsess over. It's really just incredibly unhealthy to be so concerned with someone else. No one is making you watch him or consume his content. No one is making you play on his server. It's entirely possible to rule every mention of asmongold out of your wow playing experience, it's just up to you to make the decision.
---
I knew something was up. And the damage control from the streamers yelling "wE AlSo diD tHiS On vAniLLa" when I dont ever remember people going beyond 5 man groups for any dungeon except UBRS in your day to day dungeon LFG chat back in the day was telling something was wrong with that big of groups, even if streamers have an easier time finding party members for obvious reasons.
---
This is the reddit equivalent of walking into the wrong bar.
---
So now i will have even more people to compete with to finish quests. Its already hella crowded EVERYWHERE
---
There havent been once that i've had a quest objective for myself since getting lvl 30. I dont mind leveling but i do mind when 1-6 people try to compete for every single objective. It adds so many hours on an already tedious task.
---
Honestly I kinda wish this went on a little bit longer so it would be more well known that all 5 mans can be done 10 man.
---
I like the idea of cramming 10 people into a 5 man and I'll definitely be trying to form groups for that even after the nerf especially since most dungeons can be entered much earlier than you can realistically expect to clear them in 5 man.
---
Like, imagine doing WC with 10 people at level 13~14 and getting that sweet sweet Crescent Staff super early---I'll definitely be doing that on my Warrior.
---
yes they are a bunch of entitled manchildren whose fans are other manchildren and friendless teenagers that spend 12 hours a day watching someone else play video games. very nasty!
---
IE: punkrat is a fucking idiot.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. 
---
Fuck you Blizzard we do not want this shit.
---
my guild had 100k/h
---
Who has 100 gold?
---
That cave is hell lol
---
I’ve been holding my nukes for a cheeky spirit tap last hit, has been good for dungeons so far. 
---
We still go slow because in my party of 4 we’ve got 2 totally new players, but it’s still satisfying to see spirit tap proc while 4 other players are beating on the mob.
---
It's halfway xp wise but it might not be the halfway mark time wise. The absolute halfway would need to be mathed out. 
---
What's the theoretical fastest quest route. Average kills per quest drop, time to travel, etc etc.
---
Like how thin or thick you cut limes. I prefer thin, but savages prefer thick.
---
From someone who played Classic heavily and didn't "respect" the grind to 60 and found it a chore in 2005.
---
Is there an addon that shows what enemies are casting? I've seen some claim it, but do any reputable ones actually work?
---
He accepted gols for a mount?
---
Why does this matter so much to you? Literally meaningless outrage
---
Agreed, I was paying $15 a month for vanilla years ago, now it’s back to the game I want to play. As far as I’m concerned bfa isn’t even installed or on my battlenet account
---
I do. That's why I'm confused. They only look like this while in instances.
---
You can still flag yourself for PvP, it just rarely matters. Anybody flagged can be attacked in uncontested zones, so if you've been ganking alliance players in the barrens who are trying to do wailing caverns, you might find yourself getting clapped back. 
---
Normal treats all zones this way, whereas PvP does not when playing in contested zones (practically all of them)
---
I was one of the people to submit this as a bug, and promptly reported it when I learned of it. I absolutely believe that anyone that did this should have all experience gained in raids, rolled back to make it fair for everyone.
---
OCE had one pvp server before launch. What choice did we have? Now I’m a week in and level 45 with my mates. Punished for blizzards folly of thinking a whole region needed one server.
---
How is it unaffected when just converting to raid apply raid penalty for xp?
---
Link to anything specific? Only just started watching him that would be really lame =\
---
Hilarious how desperate they are for ya to play their shitty game. Blizzard Entertainment made an amazing game 15 years ago. Activision gave us this trash. I won’t touch it with a 10 foot pole.
---
Wrong.  Trade chat and groups only for spamming du geoms for XP.  People running around in large groups AOE farming mobs.
---
That's not how the game was intended.  So fuck off.
---
Lvl 20 dwarf priest here. Which wand should I be aiming for after the greater magic wand? 
---
Some say cookies, but the I've seen things that say arcane is bad due to resistances so something else would be better.
---
Yep, take the long road, I'm in no rush either, there's nothing to prove
---
Prat?  That’s what I use and it looks like that.
---
it's not just as fast, they just had significantly more /played than your regular player
---
"Green"
---
He's a mutant looking for the easy way.
---
Watch MadSeasonShow he's the real deal
---
Blizzard released their first version of Wow without expansions to their players and it has taken a large group of players from their current version of wow.
---
We should be able to choose like, one flying and one ground mount to take with us D:
---
Does everyone not know Blizz said a medium pop server is already several layers of max vanilla pop caps full?
---
A majority of the server will have to transfer unless they want 20k queues when layering ends.
---
Stop concerning yourselves with pops now -  the real issues, dead servers and queues come AFTER layering is removed.
---
On the opposite end, there's people who enjoy Classic and don't shit talk Retail beyond constructive criticism.
---
Those are the best people. Be like those people. Be like me, the best (and most humble) kind of person.
---
This seemed like more of a streamer tactic, they could get carried through while focusing on interacting with the stream
---
&gt;Who gives a shit what that guy is doing?
---
The 100k+ people watching him abd all his subs? Plus the noticable impact he has on the community with his swarms of autistic screech monkeys.
---
Only 5 people from their retail guild were even participating in this event. So how exactly were they even going to form a raid team to kill rag? A bunch of the people on the stream weren't playing the same faction or on the same server.
---
Elves literally existed for over 10,000 years at the start of vanilla (and at that point their civilization had already peaked and was in decline) 
---
How is it possible that they didn’t know about dwarves
---
Very few because it sucked ass
---
They pioneered the LBRS 10 man spam.
---
It's funny that even with all these hooks Retail still manages to feel empty while Classic is full of little adventures that has nothing to do with each other and of which the large majority  does not involve you saving the world.
---
Instead you wander from zone to zone like a budding adventurer.
---
Someone sounds a little bitter and jealous.
---
Soda is a skilled pvper.
---
He would fuck up most people in world pvp......
---
I did this with Phillips hues, but the colors change too dramatically when opening the map or even during a duel.
---
You can actually mountain climb your way up there, it's my dad's "spot" that he discovered how to get to ages ago. He was so pissed when they added the gnome npc in retail lol.
---
Level 10 you get a quest. You can get a cat then.
---
They were gonna full clear MC within a week anyway lmao
---
I will support mad till the day I die, I was excited for Classic and then watched all his videos and became HYPED
---
ayyy
---
I don’t have time to play as much as I want to. I’m almost level 20 and I haven’t been minmaxing my leveling. But these have been some of the best gaming experiences I’ve had in years. I’ve already joined a guild and made a bunch of new friends doing dungeons and questing. 
---
Every guild I’ve joined in retail or even a game like destiny has been dead fucking air. Nobody talks. It’s so frustrating. I’m so glad when I log in and say good morning in guild chat I get a bunch of responses. I love this game.
---
With a wand it gives you flexibility with Mana Regen.  3 frostbolts isn't a hard rule.  Just be aware of how mp/5 works and you can increase your uptime.
---
I mean, its atrocious by the standards I hold *myself* to.  I'm not knocking anyone else for being lower level, this week has been the most disgusting gaming grind I've put myself through in probably a decade.  I absolutely would *not* expect a normal person to have taken a week off work so they could play a video game 18 hours a day for the whole week.  Really, I'm looking forward to hitting 60 this coming week so I can chill the fuck out and just farm herbs and do some pre raid dungeon farming.
---
I just did the exact same thing the other day haha
---
But without a way to record my honorable kills why bother?!
---
/s
---
Honestly, dailies really made me start hating wow. It went from optimal to required. I also feel great about people freaking out over a blue. A...fucking...normal...blue.
---
Ahh so I guess it’s really gets outshined by dwarf &amp; gnome in pvp?
---
I’m 40 with the Zygor guide and have had less than 5 instances where it wanted to me to grind out the rest of the level.
---
I ran SMGY about 8 times today and each time with the same group of 3 mages, warrior and me being a priest, we were averaging about 27-30k exp/hr, not sure how you've only seen 20k, that's very very low.
---
Yep I'd see a few of his videos here and there but he was never someone I was actively aware of until so many people on this sub began having him living in their head, rent free. I don't particularly care for him but some people in this sub have made him to me like TO is for bill in this https://youtu.be/w8b81UM74Ow
---
Yeah I have to have a lamp on at all times otherwise I can't stand it.
---
sometimes grinding is necessary. try to kill stuff while moving from A to B.
---
No
---
Yeah I wanted to see some classic streams. Every stream I put on, people camping dungeons.
---
Maybe I'm too old. Maybe I'm so wrong. I don't give a fuck how any streamer plays. Classic predates streams. 
---
Ignore everything and just play the game. Streaming is part of the cancer everyone has been complaining about.
---
Ok will do!
---
I would drop anyone who is incapable of keeping their word. If they cant stick to what they said then what can they do?
---
Go to dark shore like a OG
---
Oh what's becoming of me
---
That made me laugh out loud. Cheers.
---
I watched him once. What is the appeal of watching the guy? Hes not very fun to watch gameplay wise. His commentary is SO ANNOYING. Like why is he #1?
---
That's taking it little too far.
---
in vanilla, you cant check anyone's spec, so as long as you dont shadowform...no one will think ur shadow
---
Zones and quests arent streamlined, you will have to get used to going to a zone for 1-2 levels and then leaving to another for a couple of levels and then return, etc.
---
Ooh forgot about dark shore..
---
Delusional... Most people will not hit 60. Full Stop.
---
Is it really a child game?
---
Hell I farmed the shit out of ZF until early 50s from memory, I enjoyed that dungeon though
---
Group up and it gets much better, esp with a wand.
---
Who cares how others play? What's it matter if they exploit to 60 or buy gold?
---
Nugrunning is another that tracks debuff timers in a nice customizable bar. Highly suggested.
---
Life pro tip: dont date someone who thinks their hobby is the only important thing in life.
---
One of the most pathetic posts I've read in a while. It's a fucking streamer. You wrote an essay about a fucking streamer.
---
This is Ashkhandi right?
---
At the end of the day he plays how he wants to play but I do agree he's lying to himself if he thinks this is the real WoW experience in any way shape or form.
---
Over the last 15 years, I've gotten 20 or so characters to 60. It gets old. The reason I kept playing vanilla is because I love the challenge of raiding and beating my head against content with a group of people. While the bosses may look the same on private servers, the tuning was always very different and the scripting varied from server to server.
---
Also, who do you work for mr engineer, please let me believe your reddit credentials.
---
any link for that?
---
I am one of the turtle levelers (at 24 currently) and I think I'm going to be dealing with this all the way to 60. I'm currently playing at 4am in the morning and it's a great work around the groups of players but it won't be when I return to work and can only play at peak times.
---
As a priest; that must have been an absolute bitch to heal considering locks love to tap their health for mana... I ran an rfk with an arms warrior tank, 2 locks and a rogue. I was level 26 and they were around 30. I've never been so oom for so long. Didn't help that they chain pulled
---
I honestly think you just misinterpreted it. It's very clear for me what they are doing and why and I really appreciate it. There's no "wrong signals" or negative feelings, props to Method for doing what they are doing.
---
In about 7 more days, would you say?
---
A bait
---
spamming bad nub no honor is one of my pasttimes.
---
Lmao it's really not as big as you think. It gives the same amount of xp as a 5man, except for 10 people. If anything it shaves maybe a few hours off of leveling in the long run. Get that stick out of your ass
---
LOL okay. If my friend says hes going to do 50 pushups when classic comes out, and doesn't do it, I guess I better fucking drop him as a friend because he cant keep his word. Good point dude LOLOL
---
Who the fuck cares about this guy, always staring like an idiot when he watches something not wow related. Can't ban him enough from my youtube feed
---
I'm leveling a Prot Warrior and I'll kind of defend that guy.  Tanking early is miserable.  You miss most of your attacks, and can only generate threat initially with Bloodrage.  The low level tanking toolkit is essentially spam Demo Shout and taunt individual targets on cooldown.  Your ability to generate rage is nonexistant, and people have completely forgotten how the threat mechanic even works.
---
You are saying its his job which is implying he is forced to do it.
---
He is not. He could absolutely turn off the stream and go level whatever way he wants.
---
Just ... okay I know that sounds totally crazy but... what if... Blizzard already back in Vanilla officially stated that Deadmines was always DM and people calling it VC are just flat out wrong, not that they didn't exist, but that they are just wrong.  
---
I know, people still trying to defend something that is totally illogical and indefensible because they really want it to be right.  
---
But sometimes, some things that are just wrong can be repeated so many times that it seems normal.  
---
No one argues that people on some servers actually wrongfully and proudly called it VC.  
---
But it's still wrong.  
---
The only thing you and the other people do is hold up a big sign that says "I am stupid and proud" every single time they try to defend the use of it.   
---
And still, I know that its hard to accept being wrong for so long, but we all have to wake up someday. :)
---
I found him first on youtube, saw a few videos and learned to hate the guy. He literally was the reason I found a way to have youtube stop recommending me videos from certain channels.
---
Are there any zones I must do because they’re really fun/iconic? 
---
I’m a wow noob and am finishing up the barrens but I was wondering what other zones I should do as a horde player. Is there a list anywhere of super iconic or super fun zones to do? Definitely want to try STV because I’ve heard it referred to as stranglethorn Vietnam.
---
Hmm, I’m in mid to high teens and it’s happening at least once every level, and also whipsawing me back and forth between Westfall and other areas. Maybe a Horde vs Alliance problem? Followed some friends to Alliance, kinda regretting. :)
---
Youre surprised by this?
---
Play on PVE server.
---
I would Keep it man! It’s super rare and not going to sell for a whole lot. Keep it as a nice momento
---
you idiot, layers are the "instances" you speak of. other then that. all the realms are merged and you can join any of them by simply inviting another player...  You keep being a blizzard sheep, thats the last they will ever get from me and many others. games a flop, give it up. servers still shit after a full week after launch.
---
I stopped watching Asmon a while back, he's just not good, and looking back I'm not sure he ever was. I found his bravado funny and entertaining back in his youtube days, but since beginning streaming it has shown what a lazy, unskilled, leech he is.
---
what dungeon is good enough to start farming dungeons for xp instead of questing?
---
Hey! Welcome to classic WoW!
---
Don't worry about doing anything special as such, you're better off learning your character itself and how dungeons work rather than worrying about gear at this stage. The early dungeons are more of a check of level, and group work than anything in particular about your character.
---
It's more important to get a high enough level so you aren't weak in the dungeon, and to get the right skills.
---
Once you hit level 20, you should know that most people will expect you to summon other group members to the instance with Ritual of summoning. It's kind of the expected part of being a warlock, as unfair as it is.
---
Look up a few guides on how threat works classic WoW, and how dungeons are done in parties. That's the key to doing well in dungeons at early levels, not so much gear and talent points.
---
Two special notes even though you didn't really ask - once you're in the dungeon, make sure you switch your voidwalker to passive, and/or turn taunt off. You don't want it taking aggro from mobs away from your tank.
---
You should be focusing on putting damage on the target your tank is focusing, if you're not careful, you'll end up putting your DoTs on all the other mobs and then taking aggro from the tank. You don't want that unless he's handling it. You'll learn to do that effectively eventually but at first, just don't damage the mobs that the tank isn't hitting.
---
Literally who gives a shit. It’s a few people out of thousands, let them play lol
---
There is more to DPS than meets the eye. Even when you're just spamming shadow bolt (you are still watching your dots and maybe banishes or something too) you want to be able to maximize your sustained damage and your raid role which means switching to wand to get your mp5 going, or maybe lower ranks of SB, it isn't the hardest role in the group, but if you focus on being the top DPS, you will have plenty of crunchy choices to make so that you are on the top of your damage meters. But yes, just being an average DPS player doesn't take much more than five fingers and a pulse. 
---
Until raiding, you don't have to worry TOO much about totem swapping all the time during fights, as it gets to be a waste of mana to keep swapping to tremor totem after somebody gets feared, then back to strength of earth (as an example of an early swap you might be tempted to do), mostly, you put tremor down on fights that people can get sleeped or charmed or feared, otherwise just strength is fine. Anyway, I wouldn't consider shaman harder than warrior, personally, but I'm admittedly an awful tank.
---
This is fucking sad who the fuck cares. If you reply to this then you’re lost buddy. It’s a fucking video game
---
Yes please. Spam 10,000 more pointless memes!
---
Yeah idiot, people respected the grind so much that tons of people paid money for leveling guides, take your head out of ya ass.
---
A lot of times in the leveling process you’ll run into this scenario. There are other zones that you can run in sequence or concurrently to help you mitigate this issue.   
---
For example, after I did levels 10-12 in Loch Modan, I realized that all of the remaining quests I had were a few levels too high. But I played Vanilla and know that you can go to Westfall and do the quests there for a bit. And when the defias and the knolls started to mess me up a little bit too much, I returned to Farstrider Lodge in Loch Modan - at the perfect level to get me a new gun!  
---
This happens - if I recall - quite a few times during the leveling process. It’s most tedious now as, at lower levels, you don’t have a mount to ease that tiresome travel. Later on, going from zone to zone won’t be so bad. I know I’ll be in Wetlands and Duskwood on and off. Probably the same for Ferelas and Tanaris :)
---
Fuuuuuuuuuck I downloaded the game an hour ago and I can't decide who to play. I've played Druid before and I enjoyed it but I want to try something else. I've been reading so many threads and I can't make a decision. I just want to have fun. I want to do some open world PvP, I want to be good for dungeons, I JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN. WHAT IS THE MOST FUN TO PLAY?
---
What makes them the best dagger race though?
---
I’m guessing they mean the one from DM, but I could be wrong
---
Honestly, 45 minutes is _nothing_ to cry about. 
---
Jump in queue, eat dinner, go play. Done.
---
Asmon(((GOLD)))
---
Context is key mate. Or are you really saying that you consider asmon a personal friend?
---
I've started using the addon Questie which helps identify where the quests are. Some quests can be quite hidden or obscure so this helps make sure I dont miss anything. It does also have the ability to show where quest objectives are, but I've turned that off to keep closer to the original experience. Has been a lot of fun having to actually read the quests and work things out for myself instead of just mindlessly following arrows :)
---
the racial, makes you basicly have 1 more rank in stealth, or 3 more talents.
---
Thanks Captain Obvious
---
Horse shit, the average player would not do this and the try-hards would only do it since it's the meta. If you never fixed it the average people would get fucked even more over time.
---
Questing in classic is legit the worst thing I’ve ever done in any game, don’t get how people make it out to be some crazy grind yet most of the time is spent auto running between spaced out quests.
---
Hey I legit had 90g when I hit 40 on my warrior.... However I haven't trained since like level 24 so there's that.
---
A cone and a sammie?
---
If you say "I'm a rapist, I rape people", your friend says "yeah he's a rapist, he's raping somebody right now" and I go on and call you a rapist, but then your friends get angry and I go on to say "well supposedly they were just joking", what are you mad about?
---
Truuuuueeee
---
Also you are talking about hardware utilization and how  Wow uses more then POE , server based, OMEGAKEK
---
The raiding in Classic is trivial though. It's just about having enough max level characters to down the boss. There are no mechanics to these fights, they didn't even farm consumables.
---
Niiiiiiiice
---
Good.
---
Now ban or rollback everyone who is known to have exploited it.
---
The shadow wand from bfd quest is dope. Cant remember the name. It is super good for a while and you dont have to roll on it.
---
I hope they can somehow pull our character more into the center of the story during the next expansion. In my opinion it's too late to try to go back to us being unimportant or even slightly important mooks.
---
After the artifacts, we should have statues built in our honor. Right now we wear the future of Azeroth around our neck and no one acknowledges it really.
---
I enjoy being just a guy in Classic. I want to be *the* guy in Retail. Can't make the baddies bigger and badder but make the NPCs the ones the story revolves around. That's not fair to the player.
---
In fact, Classic has made me draw parallels to D&amp;D, where you start out struggling against common enemies, but you make your way up the chain and you make a name for yourself until your character is a force to be reckoned with. A real presence in the world. Classic obviously doesn't go that way, but Retail, imo, should have. And they kinda tried, but not really. We got as far as being a commander and an ambassador. Nice titles, but we don't feel involved.
---
Lmao ok then.
---
Would you mind explaining how ? 
---
Or you can just stay salty 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
How long is the queue time?
---
guys, I think OP is clueless
---
I agree. Some changes in the game have moved the wrong way over the years and hopefully people’s response to what did or didn’t work for classic will help pull them towards more fulfilling systems.
---
People vary, but questie is quite popular. That doesn't put an arrow down, more that your mini-map and world map is populated with quest objectives.
---
Some use Azeroth auto-pilot, but it really kills the fun of levelling for me, it just tells you exactly what to do.
---
What the fuck? NOBODY i've met that started in MoP EVER acted like that. Absolutely pathetic on your wifes part and it has NOTHING to do with it being in that expansion...
---
your first mistake was to think he was worthy of your praise.
---
Can’t keybind to right or left click. Closest i could get is mouse button 1 (on the side)
---
I remember in classic people used to say  shit like "no ninja" in LFG spam, and I assumed it was Japanese people whose localized version of the game renamed rogues to ninjas as opposed to asking for people who dont roll need on loot they dont need
---
I miss the retarded version of me - those were the best WoW days.
---
You’re right, int is only mana and spell crit in classic. Intellect has always been relatively weak for warlock’s even with ruin.
---
Yeah it's one thing if he's doing his transmog contests on retail, where it doesn't matter if people know where he is and talking with chat actually counts. But if you're in actual world PvP, you're not gonna be reading chat unless you're dead.
---
yap.  im savoring every single moment of this.  i level when i level and i dont care about being max level or anything.  this is fantastic :)
---
You really think people that never played vanilla did this?
---
OP definetly has some odd obsession with asmon. It really is weird to make a long rant on a subreddit about this one guy that yiu don't like but then give tons of examples of things he has done because you have been watching eveything he does. It's some really weird obsession shit that you use to only hear happening to Hollywood celebrities and their obsessive fans sneaking into their houses and shit. Its not healthy at all.
---
And don't forget your WoW burnout also being one of the reasons why your experience of retail has gone to shit.
---
Taking responsibility for your fun experience doesn't have to be a scary thing.
---
It only ever gets worse from there. Your only hope is to burst them to death before they can get a handle on the situation. Except you're missing cone of cold at your level and likely just don't have enough damage to pull it off.
---
yeah, but they werent getting exp penalty for having a raid group...that's the point...
---
Some people dont want to be on display constantly.
---
Warlock sounds like a good fit. Though some say they become a bit boring in endgame due to endless soulshard farming and shadowbolt spam.
---
Yeah, but you'll be able to kite elites 15 levels above like a boss.
---
asmon is horrible for WoW and gaming as a whole. He is that stereotypical narcissistic asshole neckbeard.
---
Fontucky eh?
---
I rolled on an RP server and just stay quiet or say very little and am generally kind and it seems to be a thousand times better than otherwise
---
No way
---
"Name your child Romulus for "my" ingenuity"
---
"Hey lemme get a stack of water"
---
-sigh-
---
-sips water to conjure water-
---
That makes me feel a lot better thank you, I hope you get some more great adventures.
---
Shadowmeld doesn't work well with the rogue class because you have to be out of combat though? And you are still slightly visible?
---
TeamViewer on phone/desktop. About 1.5 hours before you wanna play. Use teamviewer to Remote Desktop and get in queue. If you get in earlier. Use teamviewer to maintain activity by moving every 30 mins.
---
Im playing Night Elf Druid but I want to avoid quests that'll take up a lot of time but I don't want to miss quests that may be 'main quests'. Are there such as 'main quests' in this game or can I basically just skip any quests that seems like it won't be worth it. If there are 'main quests' that I should absolutely do how do I identify those quests?
---
"Guys, we're gonna get to the guide, I'm super excited here, just want to thank the chat, all you guys watching on Twitch, we're about to get to it, a huge thank you to those watching on YouTube...."
---
My god... cringe
---
Just do 5 mages, why noy
---
this post felt like brainfreeze, can you even finish a sentence in your head?
---
I dunno. I played Demo Warlock. You put BfA Demo in Classic and then I might agree.
---
I fucking hate BfA but that was the one shining light on a mountain full of garbage and as much as I love warlocks regardless, I'm not looking to spamming one button, *maybe* 2 come endgame Classic.
---
&gt; Classes weren't fleshed out back then and rotations were basically non-existent for most of them.
---
You're aware that most of that is because of the debuff limit, right? Has nothing to do with the class design.
---
I played horde in vanilla and never touched an alliance character until now. I rolled alliance for classic just to see what it was like and I must say that I am enjoying the lore and quests on the alliance side much more than the horde.
---
Holy shit why are you so infatuated with him? Let him play it however he wants, its stupid, but at the end of the day it's his stream. 
---
What happened to wow classic can be played however you want? Does that ideology change once it annoys you?
---
Apes used it a lot at higher levels. They spamed LBRS 10 man to get a ton of XP.
---
thats exactly what i thought when i heard he got gold from viewers, even after he said he would not accept it, like i would like to get free gold too, but i would not lie before the fact
---
Yeah how about we not cater to the 2% if players who are 60 already
---
It adds up over time for reagent classes... but yea, it's not necessary.
---
Maybe because you don’t have professions as a gold sink, this has helped. I’m a blacksmith and I’ve spent a couple gold on ores, and probably 5 gold training skills between BS, first aid, fishing, cooking, mining. Only 26 with 3g though
---
And how many of his SM groups were 9 mages and a priest? How many times did he abuse THIS bug to break the record. You really don't see suspicion in the fact that in the week of classic release the record for 1-60 was broken, and by a day and a half at that? that shouldn't have been even in the ballpark the first week. For years 4 days was the record, literally years, and within a week of blizzard sticking their hands where they don't belong the record is broken. 
---
fuck that.
---
Hunter. Mage gets resisted against higher level stuff.
---
I wish I could upvote this a hundred times.
---
Ah I never noticed the last sentence. But in stats terms, what does that mean? It means you always have an extra rank even if you have max rank in stealth?
---
I didnt see anything in the OP about his personal gaming experience being changed at all. So maybe try reading before commenting bud.
---
I actually leveld a Gnome Rogue all the way to lvl 7 til I finally realized I hated the way he looked running around... So I sent all his items to my new Human Rogue whos already lvl 10 and I love her lol. Moral: do what makes you happy.
---
Southern barrens, stonetalon.
---
The 10 min walk of shame with res sickness
---
don't fight higher level stuff then just aoe farm 3 levels below you
---
Yes but replace 1 mage with warlock
---
I joined in BC. How do dungeons/raids work if there's no daily/weekly lock? I know about the 5 / hour lock.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Alt right say as Alt right do.
---
I mean we already shit on retail players for having fun in retail, so why not go one step further?
---
Whats an asmongold?
---
&gt;Asmongold literally has his own army. He has 4 guilds with over 1k people. Im sure they wouldnt mind being his bodyguards while he quests.
---
Man, I can relate to the 30 year old boomer meme more and more. I really don't get streamers and the hype around them.
---
I sorta get watching Starcraft streamers or speedrunners, at least they're doing something I can't do, but WoW?
---
join a better bigger guild. I haven't done pugs since Hogger. My guild does everything together and our experience has been amazing.
---
Tellmewhen
---
Why tho
---
Why not just play the game and enjoy not trying to min/max. Rag and ony have already been killed.
---
Can you buy wow tokens with gold in classic like you can in retail?
---
I don’t think gold farmers have had a chance to amass their empire yet.
---
That's fine, but Hunter is the true ez mode.
---
ya this is a weird comment even after your edit. Druids are really, really fucking good until raiding at 60, and at that point, everyone kind of just becomes a body to support the eight mages and one warrior who matters.
---
There's all the reddit wannabe elitists talking shit about DPS pulling aggro in level 20 dungeons and healers "letting them die". Meanwhile you do this because tanks at level 20 take the same amount of damage as everyone else does.
---
What a shame.
---
Where do you get him?
---
Agree, it's not Mythic Raid hard but it's still hard.  Pugs and small/medium guilds will struggle.  People are taking APES accomplishment and oversimplifying it.
---
thanks
---
What server are you on man?
---
oh how the turn tables.
---
Well, when I played there weren't absurd respawns because 20 other players were doing the same quest as me and when I do get a tag 3 kobolds spawn next to the one I'm fighting and no one gives a shit about helping anyone else. It's not exactly the environment I first experienced.
---
Join a lower pop server=no queue
---
I dont get it, why did you just take a screenshot of org and post it here?
---
The fact that an undead skele boi resisted my smite as a priest determined your statement to be a lie.
---
man we had a fucking 30 minute letterkenny quote conversation in the barrens yesterday and it was magnificent
---
I got 20 and jumped into the DM the other day, and I got the priest and other mage whispering for the higher rank of water.
---
"Just two stacks will be fine."
---
There's no overarching storyline quests. There are large quest chains (up to 10 quests? I've seen 8 for sure) but none of them are mandatory.
---
You will have class quests to get certain abilities. Google around for it. Those are the only quests you need until endgame.
---
I guess it just depends on the player. I find managing your pets to be incredibly tedious and ammo is also crazy boring. Mages just make all the resources they ever need and shouldnt ever really die to anything
---
yes exactly. Daggers are fun and good, you can play combat dagger or seal fate. And still compete on damage vs sword rogues + you get geared on weapons faster.
---
People actually say yeet yeah yes and ye. Ohh and ya.
---
Liking the appearance of our char is far more important that we think isn't it. There is more to playing something than numbers I spose.
---
Looking for "Titan" on Thunderfury! 
---
Discord: Titan#4671
---
I'll admit I was tapping a lot, but our priest seemed to have a blast. He was almost never oom and did pretty well.
---
We wiped twice with those enemies that almost perma silence you but other than that it was pretty nice.
---
I thought the area you were gonna find yourself in was going to be the queue screen
---
I completed my Gamon Pilgrimage while on my way to do Call of Water on my tauren shaman. It was very satisfying.
---
Nah, I mean the QoL stuff that I have addons for in Classic. Just like updated inventory, minimap showing quest objectives, showing value of an item on hover, etc. Other than that I think the classic grind experience is great. :)
---
What’s there to fix? The realm is full, pick another one or enjoy the queue.
---
Actually true
---
I have already swapped servers to what was the lowest at the time. Sadly most people must have had the same idea at the same time.
---
I think someone tried to unlock it already and rolled a natural 1 Haha
---
History proves that when someone says X game will kill Y what actually happens is X dies because it's full of toxic assholes constantly reminding you that Y sucks.
---
Virtually every MMO in the last two decades has had this problem, and most of them have failed. They all play host to a bunch of disenfranchised World of Warcraft players who spend half their time bitching about WoW in another games local chat instead of playing the fucking game and driving out people like me who see that and decide fuck that, I don't wanna play something full of a bunch of bitter assholes.
---
This is what happened to Lord of the Rings Online. Warhammer Online. RIFT. Even Star Wars: The Old Republic, which is now mostly alive because the story is good while the endgame is meh (I mean it's basically a Star Wars themed WoW clone so I never saw the point anyway).
---
I'd hazard a guess that BFA has already almost doubled gross profits over the initial release of WoW. BFA's microtransactions are insidious and VERY thoroughly engrained in the community as something acceptable, even when the ENTIRE GAME has changed in ways that makes them totally pointless.
---
To each its own man...I can agree with them not holding up to their word, and I also think speeding up the adventure is a waste. But think about it, unlike the crap that BFA is this affects us in no way, Classic is what Classic is, not what those streamers and their weird-ass aspirations are. I'm level 26 and farming for the Brutal Armor warrior quest and I'm enjoying EVERY SECOND OF IT and they can't take that away from me because they all clogged themselves in their own weird-ass streamers server. 
---
I'm a streamer myself but I don't want to stream speedruns of nothing I want to stream my awesome experience savoring every quest, every zone, every little detail the game has to offer and I will...so join us on that awesome feeling and let them do their weird shit :)
---
I just got 20 on my hunter, plus a polearm from DM (1g training for that), so I went from 3g to 30s :(
---
I have no idea what I want to do yet really, just questing with my brother and I hope to do a bit of random PVP and maybe sneak into places I shouldn't be.
---
Why does it give you the server list on every login though? Shouldn't it put you on the server you were on last? I always wonder why it's different for classic
---
That is a good approach to picking a race, thank you.
---
There's nothing to fix, the servers have maximum limits.
---
If you don't like being on a high pop server there are many with little to no queue
---
The problem here is that retail makes the daily grind you and not very rewarding. As well as make it seem that its purpose is to gate players. Not necessarily give you more things to do.
---
Care to share the link? Peggle and Bejeweled in WoW were the best thing.
---
Yea going into peoples logs just to shit on them (or just point it out) on them is pretty shitty. I equate to talking to a stranger and having the option to look at literally everything they’ve ever said
---
You have clearly mistaking me for a elvui expert. Which puzzles me, as I came here asking for help. Thus indicating I am no expert. But in my limited use font size does nothing for things like the quest window.
---
Proven time and time again.

I've never had it happen, but this bit from the Q&amp;A stood out to me:
---
&gt;Q: What was the hardest thing to recreate? Where there any things (drop rates, life points of bosses, certain mechanics) which you had to make new/had no old data about? 
---
&gt;A: Hunters. They were one of the most complicated classes in vanilla and we had to do a huge amount of work in restoring them.
---
It's possible some new bugs crept in during the "rebuild" process.
---
Does he happen to make happy, little clouds?
---
Here is the thing though, we haven’t actually given them up. They are put away in our toy chests, ready to come back out and play when we feel like it. We haven’t given them away, they aren’t gone.
---
Ok, i just unlocked Heal, should i use Lesser heal instead?
---
Is there less chance to take aggro if I use a weaker heal rapidly, than if I take a stronger heal less frequently?
---
Because 60s control the market. If someone exploits their way to 60 sooner than should be possible there is a massive influx of gold and items into the economy, stuff starts to become more expensive and our of reach for the people who are playing normally. It has a direct effect on the rest of the server community.
---
Counterspell is a 10 second lock in classic. Catching a fear with that is huge, especially once you have 5 points in shatter. (Blink in to nova the lock and pet)
---
this whole post reads like a copypasta.
---
Unless you recently joined a group you wont switch layers. 
---
These are on a timer after they die, with some wiggle room I believe. I've killed one at a time in groups like that and they dont all respawning at once, some mage probably pulled all 4 like 3 minutes ago.
---
Log in to the queue before you get everyone in the house in bed, problem solved!
---
On a PS my pet bear served as an off tank when a paladin wanted to tank
---
I have moved servers already to avoid this. At the  time, the server chosen was in low. at the moment, there is only one "low" server. Sadly, I don't have the time to log in (remote or in person) in advance. I'm sorry that expecting a game that has been running for 15 years to perform better than it should. I am not personally comfortable with spending my money ( I have already cancelled live and now cancelled WoW all together) for a game I don't get to play in my limited play time. People that say "It's WoW, deal with it" (and I was one of these people for too long) is a problem. Think of every subscriber who has given the amount of time on subscription they have given to Blizzard, just to log in. The amount of free money given to Blizzard by every player that had to sit to wait to play the game is what upsets me.
---
It works perfectly, but I wish they'd do Bejeweled as well.
---
Other way around lmao. A really good 5 man doubles the 50-60k/hour garbage that these 10 man groups are bragging about.
---
That sounds strange tbh. Whats the link to the server (lock myself) and I'll see if it it happens to me?
---
But they pay more than venders.... like literally every time. Iv sold everything for more than vendors will. I can count on one hand how many things iv bought off the AH.
---
Nothing really. The subscription allows you to play both(although you would need to buy the latest expansion if you wanted to play all of retail). They are wildly different games in terms of mechanics, progression, and execution. Retail looks nicer, is more polished, has many QoL features, and has more content. Classic is fun but it lacks the 15 years of development that retail has had.
---
The reason why so many of us are enjoying classic is because we don't actually like all of those changes, or those changes lead to what we believe is an inferior gaming experience.
---
Or I'll be going horde for sure that's an easy one
---
I suggest they will be worth more when the economy picks up, and people start leveling alts.
---
Legit heard the dwarfs voice when reading that 😂
---
so you're okay with 10+ man raid groups getting 5 man exp faster than a regular 5 man group, and okay with layering making the game easier, and speeding up rep grinds by over half the time? 
---
Okay, I gotcha. My Condolences.
---
Go to a different server dude. Damn. Can you really blame blizzard when you are intentionally trying to play on a full server?
---
Loves lildik, oh boy, say goodbye to your inbox
---
Shit two hours is more than most. You're fine. 
---
If you don't feel that your playing enough for it to be worth it then you can stop.
---
less than 1k?
---
not bad, not bad at all
---
I don't think we should rush to release new content for the small minority of people playing through stuff very quickly.
---
However, it would be neat to know how a timeline. I'm curious if we'll eventually be getting expansions. I'd love for it to be something like 18months of classic followed by 18 months of burning crusade and so on...
---
I'm asking the game to play itself by wanting it to cast one "spell"? I can't even respond to that in a way that isn't insulting so just good luck with life buddy.
---
No, fuck YOU random internet guy. So fucking over seeing these posts.
---
From what level?
---
That's why you disregard the elitists and find like minded people to play with that don't criticize every little detail.  When a wipe happens, do people laugh and shrug it off or get hostile?  I prefer the former.
---
Hey what kind of addon is that? Sry if it has Been asked before
---
That's why he's 10 man spamming SM?
---
&gt; Then don't complain.
---
I'm not? I'm defending their right to play the game how they want. It's you who is complaining. How do you not see that?
---
Exactly why Lirik doesn't play on faerlina, and actively does not sell to stream people. He wants the genuine experience that the rest of us get to enjoy
---
Pvp server, looking to level a paladin
---
My friend playing warrior has just been going to areas he is higher level for he is 29 and just started duskwood now as alliance that's usually started at like 24ish he is leveling fast af
---
APES used this in LBRS to get from 54-60 after they finished ZF.
---
Asmongolds content has been garbage ever since he started streaming. It's the death of YT channels... The twitch chat is dominated by children and idiots who behave like children. 
---
So they cater to their audience because Twitch makes them a lot more money than YT, devolving their content that made them popular and well liked in the first place, in favor of a gaggle of children using their Moms money to donate. 
---
He's basically a glorified reaction channel for nerds now.
---
It seems like whenever any content creator blows up, they turn into basic bitches that just value numbers. 
---
I am very grateful to him for being the voice for Classic and #nochanges for such a long time, but nowadays I cringe every time I see his face on thumbnails. 
---
Preach has been the only one I watched who maintained (increased even) integrity and quality of his content back from Cata days, to today. Probably largely due to a Patreon based model.
---
Finally a true post
---
ugh this again.
---
Less overall decisions but the outcomes are more impactful. In Vanilla you get longer to think about your next play but you are punished much harsher for picking the wrong one.
---
It's like saying Chess is less complex than Monopoly because Chess only has 6 moves you need to remember.
---
I was in a dwarf and gnome only guild back in the day, wasn't even an RP server, ahaha
---
Has to give you a down vote for this sad thread. Seriously dude who gives a fuck?  Why the hell do you are about one person and what they are doing in a video game.  Asmondgold is entertaining to watch and that is why he is popular on twitch. He is also a big troll and it's obvious.  But to make a thread about him is very sad. 
---
How about you care about yourself and stop talking shit about people you don't even know behind their back.  You know what asmondgold would do if he saw this thread? He would laugh and that's it. 
---
You are sad.
---
How is this any different than watching your favourite player in sports be ahypocrite or do things you don't believe they should?
---
Jeez lookit Mr moneybags over here with his nearly half a whole gold.
---
Interesting.. I'll have to keep that in mind!
---
Definitely missed the point.
---
Yeah long travel times is my hypothesis for chat activity as well.

I loved every single bit of the shaman experience in my vanilla wow days. So much so that I’m trying to cut that class out and play something new and nothing hits those same sweet notes of “this is a class made to have fun” notes that shaman had.
---
Twitch kids are a bunch of god damn retards.
---
Dont be so worked up about it. It's like he said it himself he "cheats himsself from the classic experience"
---
I love whacky builds that succeed because a group was coordinated and creative.

how does he know he was world first ?  i didnt see something in chat window a msg on servers ?   How do we know some guy who wasnt seeking attention didnt hit 60 first ?   Seriously how does anyone know ?

Who twinks at all? People play the way they want. Go look it up if you don't know.

---
The big thing you're going to miss out on is World PvP, but World PvP is wildly different from battlegrounds where it will be fixed team sizes, relatively equal playing fields, and level brackets. You will get plenty of PvP action on a PvE server, but it won't be as spontaneous as on a PvP server.
---
I may try that later on, it's really odd. Thanks s for the reply
---
See you on the battlefield then :)
---
It's only 3k maybe 2 hours
---
Nobody said the devs should be watching streams and fixing shit in real tim. This would be like exactly what a community manager should be keeping an eye on, and passing it up to be fixed asap.
---
The people that watch/support streamers are really to blame.
---
play the game and make your choice.
---
Really good comment, I agree
---
This fucking thread lol
---
Let people play how they want or gtfo
---
Can't wait to be able to use this in classic! I gave it a try but I wasn't getting anywhere. I think it was because it was built for the old version of the game :)
---
Ally always skipped ww axe for bonebiter
---
Asmongold is the Jason Genova of wow...
---
Thanks dude. My life in Classic WoW was never so well defined. EVER. &lt;3
---
Why would you watch someone grind in an MMO anyways?
---
I cant think of many worse ways to spend time
---
Fucking pathetic
---
Wouldn't he barely be getting any XP?
---
That's partly why I refuse to watch streamers. Fans give them a fantasy life and financially support their antics 
---
Go get a real job imo.
---
Spend around 1.5 hour and made 14g from fish and vendor. lvl 34 UD priest.
---
I didnt use any potions or speed buffs.
---
1 or 2 gold 🤷‍♂️
---
It is pretty darn close.  Joana's /played time was almost exactly half at 44.  It seems to be approximately reflected in leveling times by others in classic as well.
---
Rushing content isn't going to help the game and it won't help the majority of the community
---
I’m not saying it’s ok, it’s obviously scummy and clearly should be patched but the method is much slower than what the APES type groups did and there’s a history of streamers getting corpse camped.
---
Both factions have shitters who grief low level players. The best thing to do is after you realize you are being camped just hearth out and go to another zone for a bit. Do a dungeon or something. Remember their names and fuck them over any chance you get.
---
During the name reservation phase people had to decide where they'd bring their huge guilds too. A lot of the realms are filled with known and huge guilds, a bunch of streamers decided on a server too so all of them and their followers are there. 
---
You can't bring character to different realms so you want to make sure your on the realm with everyone you know and want to play with.
---
I'm not past 45, so I am just a guy. If we get more recognition past 45, then the D&amp;D comparison fits even better, except we don't become demigods like in D&amp;D.
---
But a weakened Ragnaros, or *just* a black dragon, those are far cries from the LK, Archimonde, Kil'jaeden and even a Titan. Or even Ragnaros at full strength.
---
Essentially, nothing changes about my comment. The enemies got bigger and badder, but we didn't. Not really.
---
Heroes of our stature would be granted a keep with land. Where is our player housing?
---
Really showing your smarts there buddy.
---
is just good entertainment dawg
---
I hear what you are saying but this post is on vain. Everyone knows horde players can't read
---
Ravager most likely
---
AHHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Holy shit talk about over dramatic 
---
This reads like you just found out your favorite idol/celebrity was a rapist or abuser. What is this sub? it seems like all it is "lol retail sux" and "streamers bad!" oh and the latest "Method lul". 
---
Here's the truth, NO ONE CARES so why do you? He's on his own server where everyone knew exactly what was going to happen. They even made sure to warn ahead of time because people here complained they wanted to ensure they get a "true" experience which is understandable. 
---
At the end of the day he and most of the streamers were never going to get the same experience as the rest of us. It just was never going to happen, no matter what. But guess what it has 0 and I mean ZERO effect on you unless you're on that server too. There's nothing sad about this, it's just... different and that's ok. 
---
Enjoy the game how you do, ignore streamers and keep on playing it's not hard.
---
We don't know
---
Funny how this guy is catching shit from you guys... Who bitched so hard about LFG that blizz modified the API.
---
&gt;  It has a direct effect on the rest of the server community.
---
If only there were like 20 other servers with no streamers on them...
---
Touché, my alliance counterpart, Touché.
---
I hated him the moment he considered needing the defias leather chest piece in DM. What the fuck mate.
---
I totally agree, and I was really surprised when I found out how many of my gamer friends watch streams. I just don't get the appeal. But I talked to a lot of people about it, I think there are three things.
---
 Slice of life, vlog style. Improv comedy/entertainment. Watching a good player for tips and tricks.
---
I also learned that I watch way more youtube than my friends, so maybe it evens up.
---
After reading this post, I realized I did the exact same thing on my warrior. Thanks for posting, I feel like an idiot but I have so many more abilities now!
---
Literally like 5 or 6 actual Method members participated. Who were they gonna kill Rag with, a 5 man?
---
Is it too late to start playing classic? I've been busy all week so I'm just starting but I'm afraid I won't get groups because everyones in 40s by now
---
yeah that was super painful
---
Really we just need to look at vanilla private servers to see that people are still interested after years. I'm not too worried about the game dying off.
---
There are a ton of people still under level 20. I started a human warrior and it was a fight to tag a mob.
---
INB4 this is tagged as low effort meme. I swear everything is getting locked.
---
he's got issues so none of this surprises me
---
Good meme. Keep it up.
---
then before 12 hours had passed there were 2 more PVP server on launch day.
---
How do you do this?
---
Not at all, there are plenty of people playing at different levels of commitment. Even if there's a large amount of people pushing higher levels the starting zones are still plenty full. Now is a perfect time to start.
---
Had a nice chuckle.  Upvoted.
---
It's no different.  If someone put strange expectations on their favorite athlete and consider that person a moral authority, I would find that likewise naive or obsessive. . . unless that someone was a young kid.  Then I'd understand.
---
Usually I charge in rend, mocking blow, then switch to defensive stance and do basic sunder armor, etc.
---
&gt; I've never been into social media as it's stupid to me but I lose time into Reddit hah..
---
Same here.
---
I think it's because reddit is subject oriented where-as other social media is people oriented
---
I'm not a people person but I can yammer for days about something I like
---
idk what the method apes did, but either way its bad.
---
and yeah thats a part of the streamer life...deal with it everyone gets corpse camped sometime or another lol...
---
Just because someone already killed Rag/Ony doesn't mean now the game is dead and done lmao
---
Yeah I'l switch servers and play the game with none of my friends from irl because that's a good idea. I live in PDX all my friends are in minnesota i just had to join the server they chose if i wanted to play with them. So that's my excuse, what's blizzards?
---
I dont kill lowbies because I'm not a alliance scumbag! Haha
---
I only started on Friday and have three lvl 8-11 characters now in different starting areas. There are still plenty of people just starting off. You‘ll be fine, enjoy!
---
Lmao shut the fuck up dude you act like he's single handedly the only person who's experience matters. Just play the fucking game who cares what he does
---
Can you have multiple level 110 boosts stored on your account? Because I've been sitting on the free one I got for buying BfA.
---
No and no and no
---
Hell yeah him too
---
Classic is a complex, integrated, nuanced, gargantuan world, crafted by people who obviously cared about building a game that was intrinsically fun. 
---
BfA is a heavily commercialized, steaming pile of dog shit that relies very, very heavily on randomized reward system -&gt; dopamine -&gt; keep putting money in that slot
---
Ok thanks! Is there a way or an addon to see the threat in numbers or something? So I can be sure if its safe to heal?
---
in Ashenvale, along the west coast, is a small horde town with a handful of low 20 quests.
---
STM, and and TM are also good choices.
---
And I'm sure most people who picked the streamer server understand that. That doesn't affect anyone that's complaining about streamers.
---
I guess, but you're talking to a guy who genuinely enjoys ret paladin in its current state. And not only that, I enjoyed it during Legion, when literally all that class was, was activate Crusade and use their other 3 abilities as soon as they came up. A boring class by all accounts, yet I had fun.
---
But I do not have fun playing warrior in Classic. You're right about the talents, though. None of them feel impactful for me, at least so far. And it's made worse by the fact that I have 1 in prot because my friend wanted me to tank, a few in arms because I thought arms would be dual-wield, and then even more in fury because I read that fury is the PvE spec. And obviously I don't want to waste gold so early to respec.
---
Even if I did, I still wouldn't know what to go for because I really didn't want to two hand a weapon, and supposedly arms is better until level 40 for PvE and better after for PvP.
---
A case can be made that complexity is not always fun.
---
Play on a non full realm my dude. I'm on Kurinnaxx and I havn't queued since Tuesday. Still High pop.
---
Damn I forgot that removes drops RIP
---
Yeah man, go for it! If the tank needs you at full mana he will wait for you. Typically before difficult bosses. Mind, tanks pay attention to lots of things, including everyone's mana bars and their currect targets (so I can anticipate aggro loss + callout the shit not going for the skull target). Seriously just take your time man. We don't mind. It's actually hyper stressful if mages start casting before we even applied a sunder. It's not uncommon that our first few attacks don't even connect. I'm way happier with players that can wait a few seconds until at least one sunder is on the target. 
---
Also keep in mind dungeons are not DPS contests. If anything it's about clear speed, which can and does suffer from over ambitious DDs that end up screwing with a tanks natural rhythm. Unless something spectacular is going on, tank and healer can just sit there and tank for minutes in an orderly pull. Don't stress yourself ;) your dps will matter, mostly on bosses and in raids. But if you end up hurting the run just to top the meter, there's really no point. You'll be number 1 dps and be a liability at the same time.
---
Seriously I doubt anyone would even consider calling you out for drinking after a pull. That's just wrong on so many levels. If a tank called you out for that, he's basically calling out himself for being an impatient little shit that didn't wait long  enough in a situation where your readiness mattered. 
---
Long story short, drink up. Don't be that mage who starts casting with 20% mana before I hit a mob, pulls aggro, then flails around with his wand the rest of combat ;)
---
And please spread the message. It makes runs so much better. Many retail players in particular need to unlearn many bad habits to be at their best in classic.
---
they have made no plans beyond the last phase so im not sure what you are trying to say
---
Vanilla content does not invalidate itself every teir, so you are safe starting at any point actually. There will always be someone running the earlier raids to gear up for later ones
---
&gt; When the game first became playable (I.E released) there was only Arugal.
---
and by the end of launch day there were 2 more, it launched with 3 pvp servers.
---
Melderon is one of my faves. Every word he speaks bleeds pure passion.
---
Dwarf 😎
---
Who the fuck cares about streamers?
---
Christ. Y'all make me feel old as fuck and I'm not even that old. Quit watching these useless fucks and play the game you like.
---
What's it matter what people do? They are the same type of behaviour. 
---
I am saying that if it doesn't matter if they exploit to get XP then it shouldn't matter if they buy gold.
---
Like I said, "who cares how others play" was the statement I am saying is absurd.
---
That’s the problem. 
---
Video games, while fun, are a hobby for the lazy (like myself). How lazy do you have to be to watch someone else be lazy?
---
If you have a second screen, put on anything else. Netflix, Hulu, etc.
---
Nah I think anyone who regularly 5 manned dungeons skipped that pos quest
---
Mc is far easier with 16 debuff slots and the knowledge we know now. AQ and Nax might take longer.
---
I feel like #nochanges should have allowed this kinda addon to work, but maybe no one complained that the new API doesn't allow it?
---
It's kinda strange, because I only get that error when an added target is up, it doesn't ever come up aside from that... only issue is I don't know what target is up because it doesn't tell me and just errors out.
---
Anyways, I wouldn't expect you to port other people's addons, was just wondering if you would be fixing this one of yours... don't take this as any pressure or anything.
---
Thanks
---
welcome to pvp
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
Oh, do you mean that guy with shitty clickbait videos on youtube? Of course he failed, the "popular" streamers are never the best players.
---
Who thought highly of this man child? The way he and many other streamers throw tantrums is a cringey sight to see.
---
I'm thankful he helped in some way in getting people hype for classic, but he's not man of integrity.
---
That's an awful comparison as barring the first few turns in Chess you've tens if not hundreds of moves and in Monopoly you literally can only roll the dice and see what happens.
---
And I'm trying to understand why the "punishment" is different(from a dps perspective). In both cases you lose DPS.
---
Asmongold always seemed arrogant to me.
---
It was a simple question. Looks like people cant ask simple questions nowadays.
---
My buddy and I that are duo leveling ran into him in duskwood on faerlina the other day. He was getting attacked on the road outside town by a horde and my buddy kept him alive and I threw a SS on him. He actually responded to us talking to him and was really nice which surprised me being that he’s quite well known. Also surprised me he didn’t have a flock around him and he was by himself. When I ran into asmongold in legion in one of the world pvp areas I was killing him as my mage until his entourage of D riders came and blew my shit up to save him and he danced on my body. so madseason was a much more down to earth seeming person and that was refreshing as shit.
---
Cross-faction mounts is a great reason to run quests at level-appropriate so you get full reputation rewards.  Meeting and grouping with other random people, seeing those same guys in other zones and grabbing them for dungeons to build up a rapport.
---
Some of these streamers just want the loot drops from what I hear, which is dumb since you can solo MC and AQ40 with a 120 char in retail.
---
Oh god its so true. That is the curse of that video. Every class sounds incredible. I had a seriously difficult time picking too.

Because it took 10 years to get this after years of them denying the very idea people wanted it. 
---
This stubborness and the idea that they know what the players want is pervasive throughout their games now and wow specifically. So many people want titanforging gone and the treadmill loot system vanished but they won't budge.
---
Remember Master Loot fuck your ability to choose we know better you will take personal loot only.
---
Subjectively I think that classic works best this way. And on a weekend or day where you have an extra hour or two for some reason you can nerd out and do a couple of dungeons
---
&gt; Except for when they bitch about getting corpse camped or whatever snipers are doing to them.
---
You're literally creating a strawman for the sake of arguing. No one is doing this. The whole discussion is about how streamers are sticking to dungeons instead of questing for leveling to avoid the camping. The only people complaining are the neckbeards that worry way too much about what streamers are doing.
---
Leather gear? This guy has to be doing this on purpose
---
This
---
People used them to down brutallus easier 
---
Blizz then made them only work on mobs under a certain level
---
But yeah pretty sure in vanilla if you have a raid of 40 people farm them then they can make a lot of bosses easier 
---
They also used to be tradeable so you could farm the quest on alts and give 'em to your mains
---
Clearly I underestimated the abilities of dozens of Europeans on welfare that have been preparing for this for a full year.
---
He only did the layering for the last 2 hours when he was so far ahead he had it in the bag already he just wanted to save himself 2 hours of time and go to bed probably after grinding for 18 hours that day.
---
Fuck streamers. I will never understand why people want to watch other people play a game.
---
We have a statue in our garrison we never visit....
---
Horde here. We will meet on Warsong Gulch then!
---
Yeah it's unreal, especially because the game likes to just randomly drop you out of the queue as well. Have had 3 days so far where I just couldn't play because after 4h queue and still 8000+ spots to go I dare to go do groceries or something else for 30 min only to find myself back on the login screen and back in the end of the line.
---
Yes, but he's complaining WHILE doing it because he wants to get to "endgame" because that's always been what he likes about classic, not the "leveling experience."
---
Delete layering it ruined the game and people cheated with it to rush 60 faster
---
They did LBRS spam for the key to UBRS
---
Sure I would, because if I was some huge streamer, I'd roll on a PvE server to avoid that very obvious problem.
---
Prepare for the Quadlaser!
---
No. I believe it's called To *Sham* Beaux.
---
Good to know thank you
---
Like others have said, you can't just go to 1 zone and expect to level like that.
---
My advice would be to find a webpage or print it out with all the alliance zones and their appropriate level and then plan on visiting a couple of zones from each bracket. 
---
I'm currently lvl 15, I went to Westfall at 10, came to Loch Modan at 13 and I will either go back to Westfall at 16 or I might try and grind to 18 and then go Duskwood.
---
Exactly.

ok fair enough, also in my last dungeon a guy got upset that I "needed" a green drop, is there some unwritten rule about 'needing' 'greeding' drops in dungeons?

Well, those people are going to get rewarded now by being higher level by everyone else through this method and camping lower level players.

Not at all. I just rerolled last night and there are still tons of people sub 10.

I didn't know you could do that, that is handy.
---
And it can be a decent money maker, not to mention the food supply you have. Oh, and it makes leveling cooking a breeze (as long as you purchase the right recipes).
---
to be frank, he said a few days back while playing that being a streamer WONT give you the Classic WoW experience, apparently contradicting everything he’s been saying.
---
Easiest place to get mods is from the Twitch app. 
---
Speaking of which an add-on called immersion greatly improves the quest text experience and makes it more immersive
---
Actually, I have way less of a problem dying in classic than I do in retail. I have no idea why. I understand nostalgia goggles are a thing. But I just find it so charming to have to put in an 1/8th of a fuck of effort into what i'm doing. I'm not immediately showered with epics when I hit max, or gently carried to my next quest spot by my level 1 mount. Classic is hard, it's ugly, it's frustratingly unbalanced sometimes. But these are by no means detractors. Oh no, they are what gives the game life! It's flaws give classic wow it's beauty and charm. Also, a kick ass community is just the fucking cherry on top. 
---
Classic is here again, and damn is it good.
---
That's why you use your strongest fortify on the tank(s) and use a lower ranked ones on everyone else.
---
Why the heal if the mobs don't land any attacks?
---
&gt;WoW retail is literally a mobile game for the computer tailored towards people with gambling and addiction problems. 
---
What's weird is that it is and it isn't. What I think really happened was that they removed what conditioned people to insert themselves into communities and thus the people who raid with guilds became a niche among many. Raiding right now is really difficult for pugs that aren't stupidly overgeared for the content. The only way you're completing content appropriate for your ilvl is if you're guild raiding. This is the part that I still play, because it's the only part of the game that's genuinely satisfying. You spends weeks or months building up to that full clear and it's just a fantastic experience once you get it.
---
The rest of the game, however, is basically how you describe it. There's a large portion that literally just does world quests, random dungeon, and LFR which is the most mind-numbing content imaginable.
---
I think the main issue is that since they removed the conditioning that got people to be social, which changed the community makeup of the game. Those people who don't play with anyone are so numerous that the content that is sort of "on display" by Blizzard tends to be that matchmade, anti-social, white noise, bullshit like LFR. Your average player does not know that the good game hidden within retail WoW even exists, because Blizzard pretends it doesn't. I think people basically think of guild raiding as Hall of Fame and nothing else.
---
I also don't think they would have to do much to bring it back to a community oriented experience. I don't think the non-community people are inherently against playing the game how it was intended, I just think they've never been exposed to it, which is all on Blizzard.
---
Honestly I think gatekeeping classic is pretty silly. We all play games in different ways and find different things fun.
---
Games are meant to be fun, as long as you are having fun you are doing it right. Just because someone doesn't like what you like, or do what you would do doesnt meant they "failed".
---
While I get the sentiment, I feel gatekeeping is pretty toxic attitude that is entirely antithetical to the idea of classic community. Let just people enjoy the game in their own way.
---
Man Barrens general chat had me in tears last night, I was probably just chatting and joking around for about an hour before I realized I hadn't done anything and it was now 2am. And Dopehaus if you're on here sorry if you needed to pay for a therapist after last night.
---
It is also weird for me.
---
Dude, I own up to season 6 on DVD and have worn those discs the F out!
---
These are just what I've experienced. Aside from buffing everyone with arcane int, I've saved people from death then traded them conjured food/water, as well as defence/health/strength pots completely free (always have plenty while lvling alch). And help kill low hp mobs with fire blast as I run by. Gotta put out that love.
---
Yall should be banned cx
---
And if they roll on a pvp server for lvl 60 events they can do with massive numbers from their communities thslen the logical thing to do would be to level in dungeons so to not get ganked.
---
Same here. I have zero understanding of the appeal of Asmon. How did he get popular exactly?
---
uh from what I saw he'd been abusing layering from the get go, maybe not as hard at he did 58-60, but he def used it a lot more.
---
I really wish Blizzard provided a better explanation, but apparently this was a bug that did not exist in vanilla.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cyb1d3/missing_raid_xp_penalty_bug_needs_to_be_fixed/
---
Transfers will probably be added, but I'd expect them to be restricted as they were in Vanilla. That means no PvE to PvP transfers; if you want to have a level 60 on a PvP server, you have to get there the hard way.
---
Asmogay is awful
---
But who is going to be spamming LFG for Dire Maul in Westfall?
---
I understand your point.  However the streamers will push the behavior to be the expected norm for leveling due to first their fans expecting leveling this way, then that expectation gets carried to regular joes.      A streamer is in a rather unique situation and unfortunately their behaviors will influence hundreds thousands or even tens of thousands of other players.   Is it fair?   nah not at all but when you choose to make your money in the spotlight people are going to look towards you as an example of how to play, talk, and emulate overall to different degrees.    This very well of could of gone in vanilla but we really didnt have the streamer thing going on back then so word traveled much more slowly and often times in niche groups of people.
---
they don't support paypal, thats bad
---
It’s too soon to say whether the population will die down, as it hasn’t even been a week, my guess is if it remains like this they will open more realms and start thinking about free transfers off high pop realms. 
---
I hate to be that guy, but I’ve had no issues with queues at all, I had one 30 minute wait on day two and that’s it. I switched to one of the realms that opened 5 hours to release and it’s been great, but I’m on US and I hear it’s the EU that’s getting the worst of it.
---
not just retail the entire mmorpg genre. Ffxiv , teso and gw2 are fucking click one button to kill a mob. Igaf how good the story is I'll be bored af when there's no engagement in the world/leveling areas
---
im warrior sooo
---
That is because asmongold is a fucking mongoloid
---
thought this was a circlejerk post at first lol. who cares though, this effects none of us and its his choice how he plays the game and if those people wanna hand him items then let em lol. just play the game and enjoy it for yourself
---
Apparently APES didn't know about the bug, ran groups of 5 and assumed bigger groups were less efficient
---
You know that chest is extremely good for a Warrior, right?
---
You know that you can wear cloth armor as a warrior if it gives the correct stats, right?...
---
One thing I can tell you is that if they want to maintain the vanilla experience they will not let you transfer from PVE to PVP.
---
And then just casually cast a moonfire and everyone is like "wtf, who did that??!"
---
Yes. That was me, taking credit for some one elses idea. Congrats on your literacy.
---
He has so many fans tho that they would help him pvp
---
Also playing in Noggenfogger. Alliance beat the horde in the pvp event because we outnumbered them. After the event me and my buddies stayed behind and proceeded to corpse camp people when they were questing. An eye for an eye I guess.
---
Who cares? Asmon is a heap of shit. Never worked a hard day in his entitled life.
---
“We thought more highly of you”
---
Did we lol
---
lol 30.
---
That’s because you’re horde.
---
Don't worry, I'll have my mount at 40. Calm your tits.
---
I highly doubt that...they are what a pserver guild of 5 years ? I think they're just trying to justify themselves or something.
---
What are the bursty classes in PVP, and what is their burst ability/combo? I like blowing people up like killer queen
---
Yes you’ll make a lot of money especially with gathering profs. You don’t have to spend money on mounts and you can farm quite easily at higher levels. They’re also fast and fun to level.
---
Nah it's a pve realm ashkandi unles there's more than one dwarves only guild which is likely
---
They added servers and then boosted how many people could be on a server not really they fault. I haven't had a problem logging in since launch you probably on a streamers server and in that case that's your fault lol
---
I agree, it makes it really hard to form teams if you don’t know the quest. Just a relic of older game design.
---
Better buy that 3rd tier founder pack to get that extra inventory space!
---
This thread is full of jealous bois who wish they had their mounts.
---
This game is meant to be played however you want to play it, fuck right off back to retail or Fortnite if you’re upset someone isn’t playing the exact same way you are
---
Nope
---
We're not individually famous heroes though. Everyone works together as a big team to take down the big bad guys.
---
In Legion we were leaders/commanders of our whole class, especially because of wearing a legendary artifact.
---
I mean, I get why some people would miss it. It is convenient to just jump in a group and be about your way. In a world where everything is portals and queues, LFG is the most convenient way to play. 
---
However, that's why I hate retail wow. It's all about queuing up for your content. Waiting in line for your turn to play with total strangers who you will never speak to again. LFG took the soul of the community away from WoW. The moment it was introduced, WoW lost a huge chunk of what made it special.
---
Even mythic raiding is a mobile game. You have to pay to transfer servers to get into the guild that recruited you (because at this point there are literally 10x more realms than the community can support and there is like, TWO raiding guilds per realm). You have to pay for race changes. If you, you know, have a job, you have to buy gold to pay for raid consumables.
---
I was a top 200 world rogue in Legion through all of EN and the first five weeks or so of Nighthold. I know what it is the hardcore raiding offers.. but honestly it is exactly the same shit as playing it like a casual. You MUST log in x number of days to check y number of boxes, no matter how you play or why, or else you don't "feel good". And that is the single metric atvi cares about: how much can we get this jackass to log in,and what can we do to make him think he'll be logging in for six more months whenwe have literally no content planned so he can ride this stupid fucking flying pirate ship around?
---
I remember tanking in MC on Domo as a lvl 59 Druid back when it was current content. People have been short manning since forever. It's all about getting the attunement done.
---
Lol man I have no idea what happened in wow after TBC. 
---
Apparently this dude dies
---
i do have fury. rn it just feels like everyone else out dps's me and takes threat big.
---
Na one of my favorite times it's happened was when I (a warrior) was clearing furbolgs in ashenvale while waiting for this shaman i invited to come so we could do the King of the Foulweald quest. I had cleared them all out by the time he got there and was still waiting. He finally did get there so we're both on the hill about to drop the flag and every single one of them respawned at the exact same time (which there's about 6 or 8 mobs around the hill iirc). It was kind of hilarious and we did manage to survive but we were both confused that they would have all respawned like that. I'm inclined to think there's *something* buggy, and admittedly layering is my first suspect.
---
Auction house
---
That's so passive aggressive, I love it!
---
Asmongold has always been a neckbeard troll.
---
They can play whatever way they want. I'm just saying its funny to hear them complain about retail just being lfg dungeon grind to level then do it in classic
---
jokes aside always hated people not even reading their abilities for the first time . or the level 21 warrior wanting to TANK WC asking when he gets his taunt ....
---
Been playing on Thunderfury since it launched and haven't had Q yet with around 40 hours played and at least a dozen disconnects (own crappy internets fault).
---
Some class quests are indeed important. Woe to the Hunter who doesn't learn how to own a pet, the Paladin that doesn't learn how to resurrect, and the Druid who doesn't learn Cat Form.
---
But at the same time, I'm not gonna bash anyone who waits a few levels for the really obtuse/difficult/lengthy ones. If you're enough of a madman to try for Druid aquatic form, Shaman water totems, and Warrior Whirlwind Axe the moment you can, then all the more power to you...
---
I still don’t get why people watch streamers play video games lmao....like I’d rather play myself.....idk that’s just me. Anyways....let the guy play how he wants....y’all funny.
---
Ballenced
---
Southern barrons, tarren mill, early stonetalon
---
Who TF thought highly of him? 
---
He may have played this game back in its Glory days the hard way but we're all different people now. He's a twitch streamer and he has to keep the cash flow rolling in.
---
People sell out their own standards for money.
---
His own chat calls him out and at the end of the day he's going to just ignore it all and sit on the lambo and all the people looking for internet points and recognition will just keep holding him up till they get sick of it too.
---
As a viewer its tough to watch but it's still our own journey that we can live up to our own standards.
---
The new people he's hoping to bring in with his streams will expect it to be as easy, probably fail and either learn or leave the game.
---
No use getting being upset.
---
It's our responsibility to maintain the community in a healthy way. 
---
Unsub/stop watching and keep on going.
---
&gt;it takes time
---
Lore wise I'm pretty sure weakend rag is much stronger than Arthas. The scourge as a whole sure isn't, but Arthas himself is just a really strong death knight.
---
Feral is great because some fights need many tanks, and others need only a few. You can tank when needed, and just pop into cat form when not needed. You're not gonna be topping the meters, but you will be a valuable asset to your guild.
---
bro, just play the game how you want to play it and enjoy it. It's a game, he's going to play it how he wants, and you're going to play it how you want.  I personally find him really funny and cool. It might but unpopular but he's not ruining or failing anything. He's enjoying himself and the success of his stream has grown since classic launch. I watch him semi-regularly whenever he's streaming and i'm enjoying playing classic how I want to.  Just play the fucking game, don't watch him and switch servers if you're on Farelina even if it bothers you that fucking much. Good god.
---
Hol up
---
I agree there shouldn't be punishment but there were people who knew it was an exploit.
---
Worth every penny
---
Not sure what anyone expected, i think its been quiet entertaining to watch asmon level in wow... He went about it a way better way then lets say esfand who is hiding out in scarlet for the past 5 days of streaming, absolute garbage content. 
---
Asmon puts on a show here and there, there's a riot in his 4th guild and stuff like this is very entertaining to watch.
---
I can't really blame the guy for taking free shit, i mean you're never going to truly experience wow classic again when you have 100k people watching your every move.
---
All in all i think his streams have been entertaining and isn't that all that matters in the long run?
---
Relax man, the graveyard is right next to the instance
---
Shouldve used Curse of Recklessness
---
well lbrs i believe was tuned for 10 man so thats okay, but I have a hard time believing that apes didnt use the 10man raid group exp bug thing...lol
---
&gt;as a person who has watched him for a long time and has **even give him my twitch prime** 
---
Woah now!
---
Add Soupasoka to that list.
---
NOPE!! HE'S DEAD AGAIN. (side note - this poor tauren might be the most killed thing ever)
---
Classic has more abilities than retail. Every class in retail is a builder spender with uninpactful spells.
---
The boosts usually boost you to the start of the expansion, which is the substantial leveling for that part of the game. You learn the new zone, characters, etc.
---
Apes just did quests and stuff normally but with exact paths and locations for specific drops.
---
The mod Atlasloot is a very good one to have for dungeons and item sets
---
Like 10 minutes after I posted this, I left to make a drink, and when I came back I had AI on me. Some mage ran by and buffed me and I wasn't there to return the favor =(
---
What a moron OP get a life
---
Sorry about your friends. Sounds like they're not as invested in playing with you as you are them. On the bright side if you reroll and a new server, I don't think you will find worse friends!
---
Yeah its actually funny, like when I die 3 times in a row and have to run so god damn far cause I keep getting ganked, as pissed as I get, it's just more fun and interesting than face rolling and everything-scaled-to-you world.
---
NO CHANGES
---
&gt; &gt;That's an awful comparison as barring the first few turns in Chess you've tens if not hundreds of moves
---
That's literally the point of the comparison. The complexity doesn't come from the number of moves available but rather the precise timing on when and how you should make them. In BfA you press the same sequence every encounter, in Vanilla you don't. I can level 1 -120 pressing only one ability in retail and it probably wouldn't even be a challenge, good luck trying to do that in Vanilla. It's the impact your choices make that people like about Vanilla.
---
Dude its all been a shtick this entire time. Hes just a negative personality using wow to get views and all you sheeple are just being milked.
---
Well, no. You wouldn't have a sub, just BFA.
---
Lol still won’t play itv
---
Warriors are one of the best DPS specs at 60. While leveling your just as gear dependent as a ret paladin.
---
Check out Soupasoka as well.
---
Lol they didnt gain anywhere near 1-3 days. There isnt even any proof they used 10 mans.
---
Or locks his subreddit
---
Which server are you on? I feel like i've seen Savant in STV
---
Yeah I love watching streams but I barely look at classic cause I think it takes the fun out of it
---
He's literally being racist.
---
I mean, why won't you though?
---
I'm quite happy this post is here, because it shows me that despite people talking about the age demographic of classic WoW being 30s+, this is evidence that there must be a bunch of kids playing this game still.
---
Or maybe just manchildren.
---
Honestly, this is like a parody post. Who the hell gives so much of a shit about this? Let him do his thing.  This reads like an accusation of domestic abuse, not a streamer doing streamer things.
---
Never liked the guy. I honestly don’t get what others see in him
---
You misspelled pretentious douche
---
Do you have a link of the 1 - 60 guide, not the addon. It's seems like it was removed from curse.
---
So this is a "I want to be on an overpopulated server and its blizzards fault I cant log into it right now" post.
---
Lol.
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/cat160.html
---
You thought highly of this asshat?  LULW
---
Blizz doesn't need one. They put up more servers. That's the contingency plan. It worked. 
---
They warned this would happen. It happened.
---
It is 100% your fault you are in a queue. It is you and your friend's choice to play on that server. Not blizz's choice.
---
With windfury, flameshock isnt worth it. Generally open with a LB&gt;ES then AA is all that is need for one mob. At least in my experience you never get the full duration of FS on target before it dies.
---
Im going mining and Engineering on my mage gnome, but I dont feel like i get anything from engineering, and I have heard of people going 2 hathering professions and just level engineering when they get high level. I’m fairly new to the game but I’m level 15 and almost 100 in engineering... should i swap it to skinning or is it too late?
---
This sense of community is what I've been missing.  Also, the sense of accomplishment and that the questing matters.  You hit the nail on the head though! Good luck to you guys.  My husband and I played vanilla together.... him at launch and me a few months later after he set me down in tauren mill with his 60 druid.  I was hooked! Something worked out as we are going on our 15th year together!
---
Good post and glad to hear folks are sharing the love AND game time!
---
Typical horde smh animal lol
---
But most classes only use a few in any given combat scenario. I have tons of abilities as a frost mage, but unless something goes wrong I rarely ever use anything other than frost-bolt and the occasional fire blast. Some classes like paladin just sit there and AA most of the time. They gave the classes really strong identity through utility, but the actual combat gameplay is much simpler.
---

&gt;I hate to be that guy, but I’ve had no issues with queues at all, I had one 30 minute wait on day two and that’s it. I switched to one of the realms that opened 5 hours to release and it’s been great, but I’m on US and I hear it’s the EU that’s getting the worst of it.
---
My friends and I all rolled on Herod day one, and since then if I log on any time after maybe 10-11am there is going to be close to 10,000 people ahead of me which in my experience is roughly a 4-5 hour rate. This is also after the server population increase, beforehand it was around twice that. I made an alt on a newly opened to realm to play with another friend on in the meantime, but these queues have honestly added a significant hurdle to my enjoyment of the game at times. Aside from the obvious issue of having to wait a very, very long time, it also makes it almost impossible to take a break without sacrificing your ability to play for the rest of the day or exploiting some sort of AFK workaround. Additionally, it's cut down on my ability to play socially as many of my friends are on different schedules and this has spread us out over several servers because no one wants to wait that long to have to play. 
---
Now, to be clear, I am 100% not mad at blizzard about this, so far they've done relatively well at trying to find a solution. But I do want to know what the future holds, because I don't think I could live with these queue times as a regular occurence, and what blizzard plans to do will directly effect my continued in investment in my current main.
---
So glad I accidentally picked the server that doesn't have all the streamers on it making it gimped lmao.
---
I've heard Soda and Asmon bitch about being sniped on steam, but yeah sure dude.
---
On a related note. Fuck elementals.
---
I don't have a dog in this fight or much knowledge about it, but I do have to wonder if what's being talked about is partly just psychological conditioning. I mean, the way I can think of to compare is looking back at vanilla SWG. When I first played it, I was easily entertained by stuff that would probably bore me now. And I don't think it's because I'm harder to entertain or something, it's because I've been conditioned to play games in a "go go go, faster faster faster" manner. 
---
I can tell that over the years, the way I play video games has starkly changed. I have a much harder time slowing down and taking things at an even pace. I'm much more likely to rush through content that might have taken me a long time to get through in the past. And again, I don't think it's "me." It's the way this stuff is designed and the way it changes your brain. 
---
I think in particular things like achievements, world firsts, etc., tend to change how people play a game in ways that are harmful to the overall experience.
---
Streamers like him aren’t why I am enjoying Classic.
---
The community is amazing and I think a lot of us that used to watch his channel have begun either streaming ourselves, or watching others.
---
I’ve had friends from long ago reconnect, I have two generations, me and my sons, playing in a guild and leveling and we love it.  Helping new players and answering questions about quests, specs, rotation, gear, etc. that seemed to get lost in retail.
---
I think we are past nostalgia and enjoy this game for what it is.
---
the difference is the player in sports is something to idolize.
---
I feel that classic is the better game to start with because it focuses almost entirely on the journey of levelling and gearing.
---
Retail has moved away from that steadily over the years, and is now very much a race to level cap followed by a literally endless treadmill of busywork and loot boxes.
---
Even if you like the sound of retail it's not really going to give you nearly as rich an introduction to the world or early content
---

If you are a warrior the WW axe is a significant upgrade to the Corpsemaker.
---
Inb4 front page
---
Well I certainly wouldn’t start thinking about what you’ll do if this stays as bad as it is, it will be resolved. I definitely agree that they severely underestimated the player base that would be present, even though they knew pretty well after doing the name reservation ploy. I believe also that even more people have joined after launch because everyone is telling everyone else how awesome it is, which I’m sure isn’t helping the issue. 
---
They were pretty clear that they didn’t want to spread the realms too far as to avoid having to start merging servers, which sucks, but yeah they definitely fell behind. I’m positive they are having meetings every day to figure out what to do next, and I’ll bet they’re still waiting to see exactly what happens to the player base after a few weeks.
---
What does 'roll' mean. I see people use the term but I've been too afraid to ask.
---
I'm level 5 so I guess I'm rerolling to a PvP server :)
---
Why and when the fuck were 10 people allowed in these dungeons?  What possible purpose did this serve when it was implemented?
---
Lmfao buying gold and an XP exploit are two TOTALLY different things.
---
If I had known about the exploit, I would have done it too. Does that mean I want to buy gold? No. Would I buy gold? No.
---
Its the least they can do for this warrior. Cause ima be dragging their ass through end game content at some point.
---
BOOMER!!!!
---
I have no idea what I’m doing &lt;confused_dog_meme.png&gt;
---
&gt;I could embarass you with the amount I know but i'll let you suffer in those queues, hey, good classic bro!, you get to play what, 2 hours a day ?
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Excepr not really. I haven't had any queue times.
---
&gt;or you have no life and play until 9am when normal people are going to work/gym etc
---
So either I have a queue time and that makes you somehow right (it doesn't), or I don't but I'm a no life loser?
---
You're such a pretentious asshole.
---
Kill them all. That's why I came back. True world pvp. Loved ganking in Ashenvale.
---
extremely false, he probably pulled in 25% of the entire classic playerbase
---
Let's be fair and give it a few months and see how it is.
---
As a warrior? Mind me asking why? Seems like the WW axe is a pretty significant upgrade.
---
Eh, it's just in good humor fella.
---
Yes because their influence is isolated to the server the streamer chose.
---
I am not on a streamer server and people were abusing this exploit too.
---
Thanks I’ll check it out
---
Fucking scumbag horde
---
I was in an awesome Druid only guild for a long time. Loved it, and we were the largest alliance guild on the mostly horse server for a while. Freaking amazing.
---
It's extremely bad. How do you not realize the scope of influence especially for PvP realms? And now, we have to consider whether World First Rag was even legitimate.
---
Thanks - is the UI for it a bit less complex than Elv? I haven’t got the inclination to read an entire manual and spend 4 hours fiddling with settings just to move my party frames!
---
Heh, that would’ve been smart of me if I would’ve remembered the feature existed
---
I use a Lenovo x1 yoga gen 2
---
The true classic experience. People not looting mobs because bag space is an issue and it's "a waste of time". Then complaining they can't afford mounts or flasks etc.  
---
I got 4 or 5 BoE epics in a couple of months, including a Glowing Brightwood Staff I used until I got Benediction, and stuff that paid for my swift mount and lots of raid mats.
---
Sure the chances are low, but when you never loot, it's zero.
---
There’s been a real attitude problem with people in general. I play a ret pally and I was told to “go back to retail, trash” because I had low DPS. mind you I was level 15 (so literally just auto attack and judgement) and we were doing deadmines.
---
Should I go PvP just for that World PvP? I'm really not playing for the story.
---
Welcome to era of streamers and the flavor of the month
---
I'm not asking for Classic to be different. I'm asking retail to be...
---
And you haven’t been back to your training in a few levels?
---
Yeah that was it, thanks.

Ran RFC earlier today with two Shammys, a priest, a Mage, and my VW tanking.

Honestly the most fun I've had in a dungeon in YEARS.
---
Wait... aren’t we supposed to be gather Azerite in BFA? Or did I just miss the joke?
---
Imagine not realizing that it's all in fun and he's not actually complaining, fucking wooosh
---
Goddamn you sound like a whiney baby.
---
I've been having success with 2H tanking. Charge then spam Demo shout and thunderclap. In groups I can hold the majority of threat with maybe one mob running off. With bosses and single targets it's a matter of if I can get a crit heroic strike or overpower off before the dps go nuts. For the most part I just concentrate on keeping the mobs off the healer and letting the healer decide who lives and who dies.
---
I ran my tauren to org at lvl 10 to learn 2 handed axes 🤷‍♀️ ull go there eventually, might as well get the fp also
---
Lmao, happened to me too in Lakeshire
---
At least you can save future players! :D
---
Enabling action bars in the options is an addon? News to me
---
He has spent less times in dungeons than any other streamer, his last 2 streams have been completely out in the world questing.
---
This issue is present on my non-streamer server too.
---
Staggered respawns may have been something that was fixed after Vanilla or in a later patch.
---
You can bet a lot of people have been suddenly killed because of this, I already have and I was in fucking Goldshire in one of the Kobold mines lol.
---
3 of them spawn right around me like I was being Nothing personnell kid'd
---
I'm not super familiar with vanilla priest spells, but typically you want to use smaller healing spells more frequently versus big spells. Think of it like the difference between passing notes in class, whispering in class, and shooting in class.
---
Bro he’s in Esfand’s guild and so am I! &lt;Crusade&gt; kicks ass!
---
I've been playing for 4 days. First off it's brand new, secondly they added new servers, third I've NEVER had a queue, if you don't want to change servers that's your problem. Something something you a bjtch hmmmm eat dick
---
I mean almost everyone in classic is over the age of 25+ (based on surveys) so I don’t think it has to do with age
---
What a load of bullshit. If you are getting less xp/hour in a 5 man dungeon spam than what youre getting from 10-man farming your comp and your skill sucks.
---
They ruined it for themselves. What are they gonna do at 60? Raid once a week? Most viewers won't even get to 60, let alone play much at max level. The big moment of classic happened in the past 6 days. They wasted it.
---
It made my day when a DM group I tanked for all thanked me for "great tank" after we dropped vc. Seeing how people actually bother being nice to each other is so heartwarming
---
I won't speculate on what knowledge someone was or is in posession of but it seems unfair to assume the worst about someone. I hope nobody who's under the scrutiny of thousands of viewers would deliberately and knowingly abuse a bug since it would easily jeapordize their accounts.
---
Yeah, now that they fixed it, they should do something to counteract the effect it has on the community. Tons of people are pissed about the streamers and insiders getting away with cheating.
---
I, too, play on PvP servers so I can ignore world PvP.
---
He means that the viewers like WPvP. Asmon has said he would much prefer to play on a PvE server. 
---
I don't really like the guy all that much but streamsniping is some low shit
---
That's up to you if it's something you think you'll enjoy.
---
Lenovo Yoga S1 over here. 12.5 inches. Works amazing at 50-60fps at 3/10
---
Add in to that Nixxiom, Bajheera, and BrutallStatic. They seem like pretty legit people to me.
---
Such a good time man, I do the same
---
I use pitbull not shadoweduf but there it is on by default and you can change anything you want to pretty much anything you want.  
---
Small disclaimer the options can be a bit daunting if you are not used to setting up things yourself.  
---
Also elv ui and tuk ui are both working if you like any of those lots of people do as it is a whole big setup for everything
---
MMO Streamers are terrible, everyone knows this.
---
dude thats fucking hilarious
---
True. But for me, and I should have said earlier, I am with a large group (15+ people) that wanted to play together like old times. Trying to change is not an easy task when everyone would need to reroll.
---
Imagine basing your entire gaming experience around a fucking streamer. Grow the fuck up i'm so sick of shit ass people like yourself. In fact better yet quit the game... quit gaming in general it would probably be better for your mental health.
---
To play Classic you really dont need much my dad plays it on a HP chromebook on classic settings. I dont know the reviews on the Stealth but I allways heard it was a good laptop
---
I had to block his account/channel so it stops appearing on my suggestions. The dude just makes content for idiots
---
So... because someone doesnt do/play like you want them to... its their fault your unhappy? 
---
Holy shit, i hope you never get a position of power. You'll literally ruin peoples lives over your narcissistic ways
---
Never cared for the guy to begin with. Bajheera deservesa better spotlight than some neck beard who does mount offs for a streaming event.
---
ohh I think you convinced me hahaha
---
I wonder if that's really true. He isn't just Arthas, he also is Ner'zhul, given power by Kil'jaeden, wielding Frostmourne.
---
It stacks up, and he did instawipe the entire group there. If Tirion (forever in my heart) wasn't there, that would have been the end for life on Azeroth.
---
The Lich King, to this day, had the best command of the power of unseat. Sylvanas is getting there, but the first Lich King was a force to be reckoned with. By comparison, Ragnaros feels like just an elemental lord.
---
But fair enough, I can see Ragnaros being stronger too.
---
hey man I've a bit of it and let me tell you that it works, but you've got to have a solid team. you can't tank as much damage so your dps can't be stupid/underleveled for the dungeon. Also I would highly recommend being the same level as the end boss, any lower and you risk wiping.
---
Keeping aggro is easy, just I would say that you'll want to use a dagger since you'll often only be able to use auto attacks to apply threat when you pull multiple mobs and your earth shock is on cd. 
---
Oh, and invest in mana potions :P  lots of 'em
---
I decided last night I’d sit on fenris isle and farm gnolls for wool cloth. I noticed so many people going there for the quest so I told the low level people I’d help them kill the gnolls if they let me keep the wool cloth.
---
actually turned out really good because I got more than enough 😊
---
Ohhhh thankyou
---
Yeah you're clearly just an upset anti-classic baby in disguise. How can the game be a flop if so many people want to play it that almost all of the servers are full?
---
Oh, but they clearly did. They knew about this bug since the Beta.
---
I duno why people like Asmon that much...
---
it's gonna take me soooo long to get succubus
---
Hi, /u/ChocolateMilkWarrior
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cyk8ok/is_there_a_current_working_version_of_power_aura/). 
---
It’s great to be back. I knew what I missed about earlier versions of WoW. All the RPG elements that are lost in retail. Class quests. Reagents. Bag space at a premium. Travel decisions. Exploration through dangerous zones to get that new FP. Non linear/hub based quests sending you all over and linking zones narratives together. Grouping in the world as a regular requirement. I’ve had tons of little groups so far, always a hi, maybe a conversation, an appreciative thanks at the end. Staying on a bit longer after you’re finished your quest to help with their last few drops.
---
The vibe out in the world is magnificent. I’m so happy to be back.
---
I would kill for a couple more charismatic PoE streamers :C
---
I doubt he's a millionaire, but he definitely makes good money from his stream
---
The law of conversation of energy: Am I a joke to you?
---
Since those are leather shoulders, odds are you're playing a rogue. Crippling poison is a great tool for stopping runners, since it buys you enough time to finish the mob off with another sinister strike or backstab. It can also be used in combination with ranged players to assist them in kiting mobs endlessly.
---
You're playing the wrong game.
---
He probably was the same on Classic.
---
I feel bad for not being able to buff back but i just give some stam buff food away every now and then instead
---
Paladins really aren't able to tank in vanilla. They have little to no way of keeping threat, few high threat abilities, no taunt, and bad base dps means there's next to no way youll get things to hit you. Paladins couldn't tank until BC. Sorry friend.
---
Have you learned all your spells?
---
I dont play lock but I would assume that the taunt can be upgraded at the demon trainer
---
As a shaman, I just told the warrior to 2h DPs and occasionally throw out taunts.
---
So far, IFA worked flawlessly throughout RFC, DM, WC, SFK, and now just RFK.
---
Shaman/warrior fighting for aggro and focusing down targets we've been steamrolling through instances.
---
This all seems like classic WoW play style.
---
Am I the only one who played classic and remember this being typical?
---
It's not a gnome.
---
Wait... OP what realm are you on, and is your orc a female shaman?
---
Sadly no, frostbolt is your only good source of damage. 
---
My rotation is usually max range frost bolt 3-4 times, as the enemy hits melee range I frost nova, then repeat. Usually finish them off with a frost bolt and fireball. 
---
Also make sure you did your talent points into lowering the cast time of frostbolt &amp; the effect of your slows!
---
Which is why I don't mythic raid. I stick with a less serious guild that just shoots for curve and a few mythic bosses. I can pull off just doing content I want to do(which is 99% just raiding most weeks) and playing a spec I like playing(the only sub rogue in existence) without taking shit for it. I generally say fuck the meta and fuck weekly requirements.
---
That's what's fucked. If you're too hardcore the game sucks, if you're not hardcore at all(afraid of guilds), the game sucks. And what's even worse is that the suck is something that was coded in intentionally and I feel like the enjoyable part is a fucking oversight.
---
It's a combo of Shadowed Unit frames, bartender4, titan panel, Prat, and I've added Bagnon recently.
---
The logic in this post is pretty low iq. So many actual idiots on this sub, ironic really since you all think asmond is a complete idiot.
---
Find something better to talk about you’re going to ruin your own classic experience
---
Not Elvui.
---
Yeah hold on lemme just get all my friends and guild that have already started playing to start over on a new server
---
This is the most mellow dramatic shitposting I've ever seen.
---
Selfishly the two modern QoL changes id love to have in classic are dual spec and aoe looting. People freak out about that shit though.
---
could somebody explain to me what I missed out on that got nerfed?  I don't watch streamers, I want to know what they were doing that was different from Vanilla WoW that just got nerfed away
---
It's Prat.
---
But what does it say for DM?
---
That was kinda obvious..
---
It is not Elvui.
---
Hi youtube
---
I'm fully erect.
---
Awesome macro did you have any other good warlock macros? Or Addons specially for warlocks.
---
I just like to think of it as a random boar rejecting God.
---
”We want that Classic experience” they say as everystreamer spends all day 10 man speed running dungeons like its BFA. Nice.
---
And let them win??
---
I thought that proc applied a debuff to the enemy
---
At 60 in raids you do.
---
They did know.
---
You almost certainly wont because nobody else is going to want a nerfed xp rate.
---
I'm playing Paladin. .  . The amount of people who go ham in the first 2 secs of a pull then scream for a taunt is baffling. Also had a warrior DPSing in my group today who literally spammed Hstrike and Sunder Armor. ..   like why the fuck are you not talking this if you want to spam all your threat generation.
---
&gt; Que - the short form of queue
---
No tho
---
As a Tauren Druid I find this to be the case.  Almost no one tries to kill me.  I did have a warrior and mage duo try to jump me 2v1, managed to kill them both, even though warrior already had WW axe (he was 31). 
---
Drood too strong to kill, had I lost the upper hand in the fight I would have just bounced anyways, and there isn't shit they could do about it.  
---
But as a result I always leave people alone as well, as long as they aren't killing an ally around me I will let them do their thing as long as they let me do mine.
---
Could have told you this without watching. All he's ever done is get others to do his work. He's a clown and purely there for a cheap laugh.
---
Get the questie add on from the twitch desktop app, it will tell you where to go, show all quests on the map so you can pick them all up before hand, show you on the map where the mob to kill / item you need is. 
---
I am new to wow and this helped me so much as I had no idea of where I should go or where things actually were that I had to kill. Saved me so much time googling everything.
---
Can take the retail out of some of these people. Have had a silly amount of chests and BOE blues ninja’d.
---
What are you talking about, he was litterally running around Tanaris dying to random red mobs just to explore shit
---
Had a dude freak out on me in whisper because I didn’t give him int after he drive by fort’d me. Not my fault I was oom from fighting two mobs and was panic bandaging as another one was sprinting at me and couldn’t be bothered with his buffs.
---
The way mobs run off and pull other mobs seems different than private servers: In classic it seems like you have to do something to them to generate threat, while in social threat range of other mobs, rather than the mob just automatically pulling when it has an ally in combat run past. 
---
which is nice
---
You can download the Twitch app or get them from Curse (I don't know the web address since I primarily use the Twitch app now).
---
If you tank sunder is how you are going to maintain Afro most of the time. If you are dps in a dungeon I wouldn’t use it. The tank will be furious and you will take Aggro. If you are solo your rage is better spent on damaging abilities.
---
Not to mention their community fuels this experience with their "generosity" with free gear and gold. I have no doubt streamers will be the first to get geared in their raid teams.
---
Sounds like a great way to get a mob on your ass pushing back your spells. 
---
I can easily keep a DPS alive through most stray mobs, and I'm not so bloated on my ego that I'd stop myself from doing so.
---
Why as adults is anyone giving these streamers money?
---
I’m all for esports and compotition but watching people play a game just to play? That sounds boring as fuck, especially when you could be playing it instead.
---
Are you all trying to reach your inner 13 year old?
---
Play the damn game.
---
Cuz we wake up early in the morning where there arent any queue times and play all day, theres a lot of neckbeards on golemagg
---
I don’t blame them but I think when they pretend for months they want “no changes” and they refuse to accept donations but then immediately take everything and do nothing but dungeon grind to rush to 60... that’s not classic wow that’s BFA in a classic wow disguise
---
It actually helps them level weapon skills faster. Or so I've been told. So, it does something :)
---
Browsing the popular feed right now and I must say I have no idea what the fuck is going on
---
Jagex really is powerless against Blizzard
---
And this is why I opted to skip the venture co area of northern barrens. Stupid mobs running to get health.
---
World first book
---
No, no it's not. Also, how can you honestly say this when the World First Ragnaros kill and WF60 ALL used this exploit?
---
i dont quite see how he failed classic wow from what you describe... seems he's a bit needy, but he's not alone in that, and it's also nothing out of the ordinary
---
You turn on your tv, it's there
---
you can watch it without "attempting" to watch it.
---
you gotta actively find the streamer and watch it. it's a difference
---
I'm level 31 and from my own independent testing, flametongue is better than both of them. Windfury is cool when it procs but when it doesn't it's lame. Rockbiter does the same damage as flametongue but with flametongue, you get two different attacks and each has a chance to crit.
---
SM and Zul Farak I distinctly remember grinding a lot of in vanilla on my priest levelling. Played the beta and started day one of retail so it definitely happened back then. I did nearly every dungeon at least once but those 2 I did a lot of. I think SM Graveyard only once but the other 3 SM instances like a dozen times.
---
I don’t think it’s about the streamers...
---
Most people are doing it so that they aren’t on a dead server when the game population inevitably drops (once the hype dies).
---
asmongold watcher, yikes
---
Now skin it!
---
You must have some sort of social deficiency and can’t see social cues. Maybe if he put on a wig and sun glasses with a red bullet proof vest then you guys on this sub reddit would finally say “Ohhhhhh it’s a character.....”. Yes Asmon uses a persona on stream of a  try hard sore loser neck beard. Anyone without autism can see the social cues. Maybe next time he does it look at the webcam instead of instantly tabbing over to this sub Reddit to post a clip and make a thread and you’ll see him glancing at chat out the corner of his eye smiling and then overreacting even more.
---
AQ was 1.9 &amp; Naxx was 1.11
---
thanks! level 6 so far. really enjoying it. do i spec shadow for questing and 5 mans even if i would want to heal in the 5 mans?
---
I feel like I've been doing so much better than in vanilla, way more efficient. Yet I'm still only lvl28. Yup. This is gonna take a while. Hope I get to 60 and attunements done within the next 3 weeks. I'd be proud if I managed all of that within a month!
---
I mean, it is what he does for a living. He plays this game to stream it for money full time.... Most people know a lot about what they do for a job.
---
Sure, maybe his job and knowledge seems a bit more 'trivial' than your average 9-5, but he should know a lot about the game. It's his profession.
---
So it is our fault that blizzard grossly underestimated the amount of people that would play? Everyone should have just payed for something they werent able to play yet. Okay mate
---
Lesser complex what?? Dude they literally removed 75% of all spells and shit in retail. There is nothing more retard friendly than current retail rotations.
---
Frankly I think people have become more shit in the past 15 years. No one plays for fun anymore, only to be hyper-flawless efficient. But.. for what? 
---
Saw this in OSRS too, no one plays castle wars anymore because it's a "waste of time" apparently.
---
You get different ranks of spells. You often will down rank but not every spell is going to be on your bars multiple times.
---
he never said he was okay with it, fuck off with your peanut boomer brain line of thinking
---
Classic Classic
---
What I find funny, while 10 player dungeons were possible in vanilla Ican't recall a single time someone formed a 10man group for it, I doubt you'll find a video from vanilla doing such a thing, now because of streamers you have chat littered with Aoe dungeons grind, it was already hard tanking due to no one letting you build up aggro or rage or just attacking a random target.
---
This has been made harder.
---
It can be at times for sure, there were times back in the day where I had to just walk away for a couple minutes and let them get bored of camping my dead body.
---
But those times were few and far between and the times you are on the other side of the stick balance it out. I feel like if nothing else it's a more immersive believable world that way
---
Oh, I'm talking about playing a feral druid, a tauren specifically
---
Even if i would be healing un the future?
---
That's nice and all but these people have watched the movie before and they did all of that already
---
I agree that the nice part was questing but it's fine that they don't want to do it. 
---
Plus i'm sure they're all racing to be geared for BGs as well idk
---
Why does my wand stop auto attacking?  I have it on my action bar and when I hit the key bind 9 times out of 10 my char will do the anination and maybe one shot before stopping.  I have to hit the keybind a 2nd time before my wand works perfectly.
---
Yeah, but they have always banned people for similar things even when those people didn't know it was an exploit. A temporary ban is fair and should be expected.
---
200k a month = roughly 2.4million year, before taxes. Which for the record is not enough money to ‘be set for life’
---
The swing timer.
---
How salty are these kids? It doesn't affect anyone
---
yea we all went on kirtonos
---
streamer bad
---
After seeing all of reddit talk about how layering was going to ruin classic it's pretty pathetic to see this be the meta.  At least in layering you would see some people in your layer.  With the SM raid meta, everyone was in SM.  STV pvp?  Nope, nobody there, everyone aoeing down SM.
---
Was apes the first guild to clear mc? Are they the lights hope apes?
---
Faced this decision myself. Personally I think the servers will die and unless they are planning on merging later then there's no point.
---
Then I was like I can just transfer to high pop server after I max in a low pop server. But back in classic it was only a one way street High Pop -&gt; Low Pop. Everyone is waiting in the queues since they are planning on playing more the a year+ so dealing with the queue now for a undead server only makes sense
---
We can't figure it out. It's stuck in there with glue or something I don't know
---
That is true, but ActivisionBlizzard said, "No changes."
---
Mine is also claiming to be updated (Twitch user as well) and yet seemingly does nothing.
---
Most popular streamer would just get corpse camped if he even attempted to level outside of an instanced dungeon. 
---
Donations have always been a thing, even in retail. 
---
I’m not sure what you were expecting to see really.
---
For that it’s because you were flagged for pvp. The Barrens is Horde territory. The only way an Alliance can attack you there is of you intentionally flag for pvp on your portrait, have attacked a member of the opposite faction (player or npc) in the past 5 mins, or just came from a contested zone and need to wait 5 mins.
---
Not a huge fan of the guy but wouldn’t you be addicted to the persona too if it made you 500k a year just to play your favorite video game?
---
Why should I be helpful to people are so rude to ask a question that as already been clearly answered multiple times? People who are too damn bone idle to even do a simple ctrl+f but instead want everything done for them.
---
Should have /danced for some silver.
---
you thought more highly of some dude who does  nothing but play wow, living at his parents house while he's what... 30 years old or something?
---
I mean, i dont care. i dont watch streamers. i think i've seen 1 video on youtube with asmongold. i dont understand why people would watch him play..
---
also, wow is a terrible game to watch, as a viewer. it's not super viewer friendly
---
It's not really any different than other things people watch other people do. It's entertaining for a lot of people, and they donate to show their support.
---
There's no such thing as a "fury warrior" at 18, he's just a warrior. 9 talent points aren't enough to make you a specialist at something. A "fury warrior" and a "protection warrior" at level 18 will function exactly the same.
---
Yes
---
Yes let's do down that slippery slope route what could go wrong.
---
Hard no and genuinely wtf, small minority my ass just stick with BFA why don't ya
---
Cool
---
If they kept the same quests out there, then its about finding the right quest chains in those regions. On something like my 8th character I stumbled upon a basically 4 level long quest chain in the Blasted Lands and it took me all over the world. It ended in a blue level 60 item after killing a silver epic on top of some pillar in the Blasted Lands. Was absolutely my favorite time questing in vanilla
---
Have you even seen the insane amount of rare items and blues people are selling atm? It isn't remotely normal.
---
As and Undead mage i dont make food. Just eat people.
---
Okay dude
---
You know, this way of thinking has been around since the beginning. Hilarious to try to blame it on retail lmao
---
your other option is to deal the queue, something that you knew would be a thing as Blizz told everyone that the Full servers would have long queue, Even Before playing.  
---
and hey maybe if you did all move over to a new sever with less pop you might get ganked less and have to deal will less people doing the same quests as you meaning you can level faster.  
---
But nah, it's better to wait in a queue that you knew was going to be a thing and whine about it instead.  
---
 
---
it's a damn shame there were 3 PVP server on launch.
---
people actually thought highly of him?
---
Druid should have a different feel once you hit 20 and get cat form I imagine. 
---
Shaman I was really tempted but part of what I really liked about them is the ability to summon the elementals that fight for you. Made it feel magical. 
---
How you got a warrior to 25 idk. Congrats man unless you had a pocket healer that must’ve been an adventure. 
---
What do you enjoy? Melee? Fast attacks? Mobility?
---
Wow classic is awesome
---
Bitcoin is great
---
Beyond Meat is great Stock jumped 20 %
---
Canopy Growth cannabis stock is great
---
is that an energy tick addon? whats it called?
---
Oh look, it’s this post for the 1000th time this week.
---
Talk to a guy in Silithus.
---
I am with this. I don't want to start screaming "lol bfa bad never gonna play" like some people surely will do. I am sure this has some business strategy involved but it's also great for WoW players. We have freedom to try out and play both versions. No one is forced but if player who quite in TBC wants to know what BfA is like they can now do it without extra charge. And also making Classic share sub with retail gives them possibility to try out Classic because maybe they started in Cata.
---
Start drinking when out of combat. FINISH drinking. Doesn't matter if tank pulled. You'll drops a few dps on a pointless meter, so what? Drink up and play.
---
Thank goodness. When I heard about it I wasn't looking forward to saying I wasn't going to do it.
---
They still have to actually interact with people to get a group going and the fact that you've been part of these group usually means you'll get invited to join another one. 
---
You absolutely missed the criticism retail gets, which is the fact that the community is gone, because of everything being automated. If I'm a dickhead in Vanilla, I most likely won't ever get picked again for a group with the same guys, while in retail, I'll sign up for a new one and meet somebody else which I'll see again when the dungeon is done. That's the criticism Dungeon/Raid finder gets.
---
Their strat had to do with the way they pulled. They would use a warlock eye with a priest bubble to basically pull the entire zone at once.
---
They have fewer unique abilities but a more well rounded toolkit.
---
Retail classes all have a CC, interrupt, movement boost, CC break, slow, etc... Class compositions for *the vast majority of content* is largely irrelevant.
---
Classic classes tend to be more niche with each on having a fairly unique identity. While no class is *required* to clear group content, there is a noticeable different. 
---
Having a lock join your group is genuinely exciting, even if it's just so you don't have to wait for someone to run from UC to WC. Mage food/water is much more valuable when health and mana are strictly limited resources, etc...
---
Jesus
---
What do you care how someone else is playing the game
---
It's not your business to care about
---
I do understand why ppl hate streamers but you are one of those pathetic ppl that are obsessed with them
---
Hunter bugs?
---
Hahahah, my favorite thing to do to beggars in trade is to whisper them, "Sure, I can give you some gold!  Join group!".  Invite them to group, meet up and say something like "Hey we just gotta make a quick pitstop in Darnassus, click the portal, we will be there quickly.". Summon a portal and watch them fade away, drop group and leave em en elf land.  It was one of my greatest joys.
---
Now I'm tempted to make a Mage again.
---
Priests can only be played on the horse side by troll or undead. 
---
At level 60 (I believe) trolls get 2 skills specifically for them (might be 3 I forget) One of them is a debuff and the other is a shield that has a chance to stun. 
---
For undead they get a massive damage shadow move (not sure what else) 
---
https://youtu.be/wnZQzO9h-ek
---
Same YouTube as they’re talking about above and he mentions it in this video I believe when he goes over what race he thinks is best for what class
---
What level should I do the rogue poison quest if I want to maximize my lockpicking skill?
---
&gt; A lot of the changes made to WoW were supported by a very large percentage of their paying customers.

That's why *good* game design teams don't let the popularity of ideas among their players drive their design.  Players will *always* ask for things to be faster and easier -- and they'll clamor for it with all the fervor they can whip up, even though it's ludologically unsound and ultimately strips the game of the challenges that make the game worth playing in the first place.
---
And the worst is that, as a designer, if you do the *right* thing and the game stays healthy as a result, you'll never hear the end of complaining from people who will continue to insist you did the wrong thing.  That you're insular and devoted to your vision.  That you don't listen to or care about the players.
---
Why don't they put a hard limit of 5 man party for all dungeons? If you're in a raid, you should be automatically prohibited to enter any dungeon. And if you're already in a dungeon, you shouldn't be able to join a raid in anyway.

Shrazzeah EU :)
---
Maybe. i find it fun. Lots of others find it fun. i don't know if you will. Try it and find out.
---
Its Samwise Didier, art director and vocalist in blizzard
---
Same thing is happening to me. Is the spawn bugged?
---
Elvui isn't really difficult. It pretty much sets itself up and then slowly you can play with the options. I've not tried it in classic, but in retail it was actually one of the easier ones to me to learn.
---
thank you so much. do you have any other tips for priest?
---
Weapon speed is normalized if that's what you're asking
---
God damn y'all are some cry baby bitches.
---
*60 levels
---
Bis twink 19 (Rogue). Wait for pvp and twink a rogue now for phase 2.
---
I'm leveling and neglecting cooking and fishing and I feel I shouldn't be
---
So basically the same
---
It's labor day weekend you should have known there was going to be a que.  You need to set it up before you are ready to play.  think of it like going to work when you know there is going to be traffic you leave early well in this case you know you want to play at a certain time so set it up early and hopefully when your ready it's at a decent amount of time left.
---
My group has run the dungeon 5 times. We got Black Malice, Gloomshroud Armor and Assassin's Blade twice. Anyone else experienced this kind of drop rate? Did we just get lucky or is it bugged?
---
4 strength 4 stam leather belt?!? Uhhhh. Ahhhg.
---
Watch out, everybody. We've got a badass over here!
---
We talking about politicians or streamers?
---
It wasn't, this was on Shazzrah EU. We rp'd anyways though.
---
We're not talking about people raiding dungeons, we're talking about them raiding it for the purpose of leveling quickly. That did not happen in vanilla.
---
Night elf ughh
---
  is there an equivalent or similar class in alliance to shaman? i really like the shaman play style with totems and both dps and heal, is there anything similar in alliance?
---
It's a marathon, not a Sprint.  At least they don't take away xp when you die like in EverQuest.  Classic doesn't have  single zone streamlined leveling, you gotta travel.
---
That shaman gathering. I personally don't have a lot of problems with buying skills.
---
That's couple hundred gold down the road if you wanna sell it.
---
Yeah streamers suck, not like they say anything mildly interesting other than ‘oh thanks xyz bro for the sub’ it’s not like any of the streamers are actually ‘good’ at wow classic in anyway that separates them from an average Player, and they likely are hooked up along the way by wannabees
---
Can 2nd is fun
---
Yeah, so many dude. I remember that being up around 100+ gold during BC, LVL 10 twinks rock it hard.
---
I'm loving Classic so far, but I'm not sure that I would feel it's worthwhile without playing on a PvP server. PvE servers are still pretty popular though, so, I guess a lot of people still enjoy it.
---
Against all elites that are going to die to physical damage, sunder armor is worth using, basically, and bosses doubly so, but you must apply it while they are at almost full health. 
---
Against normal mobs it starts to matter. 20 is a very bad level for sunder because it's 2 levels before you get a new rank. It's about as bad as sunder ever gets. 
---
As for 22, which is the more interesting question? Yes, it can be. [This sheet is well worth having a copy of.] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bwSy3x42Y6HwifkalxtyHS58SSmmHbqqmHpilnTVpsw/edit?usp=sharing). sorry I can't share the original with you, only my copy, but I didn't save a link to the original. Suffice to say it's not my work and full credit to sakujo and beanna of fight club discord. 
---
What you will notice is that against single targets (where cleave cannot be used), sunder armor is your second best dps ability, behind only rend.
---
And it's by a large margin. As long as you are applying sunder (At 22) while the mob is above half health, sunder is comfortably better than heroic strike. If you apply it at a mob with 85% health or more, its a LOT better. 
---
Further details should be investigated by modifying the spreadsheet linked, but yes. Sunder is very viable while leveling, even against normal mobs, and certainly against elites. It's almost impossible for 5 sunders to not be worth applying to a boss. Maybe if all of your dps are casters. But even then, you would need to stack sunders to hold threat.
---
Cat looks like he is there for consultations as needed.
---
What did you expect? You obviously watched his stream for more than 5 minutes but you somehow didn't realise what an idiot he is? This post says more about you than him
---
.....

I have 3 level 120's. Was bored within 1 month of release. Just going through the motions. Logging in to do chores each day. Then they gave us a classic release date. I was so excited. I couldn't contain myself. Logged in to try 8.2. Was bored in no time at all. Just the same chore but with new welfare gear. Logged off and didn't go back. Classic launches. I have 2 days played already in one week. Each day I can't wait to log in. It is a joy each day.

Checkout MMO-Champion or the wow forums to figure out what time zone they are before you choose one. Choose one in your timezone

You might find this hard to believe, but I was *having fun* 10-manning dungeons. Four-pulling graveyard actually is fun and engaging for many people. I was in a 10-man when the hotfix went live and the general attitude was "FUN DETECTED." We were disappointed, and not because we're rushing to 60 as fast as possible (not me, at least). You can't make people go back to being worse at the game to where they weren't capable of doing this on the fly, and you're *not the arbiter of the "true spirit of vanilla"*.
---
APEX is Gehennas EU I think
---
I’m only lvl 27 and I’m having a blast just doing quests and re-exploring everything and leveling professions.  I don’t understand the rush
---
You can grind SM for like 15 levels; go into graveyard in the high 20s, and finish in the cathedral in the low 40s.
---
It's not so much that they give more xp as it covers a huge level range because it's actually 4 dungeons. Also, SM starts being an option around the time quest xp starts really sucking.
---
Hard disagree. I give that shit away for free unsolicited all the time.
---
You were just lucky I believe.
---
Wonder why there's so much that can't be said. Like why even ask people their message and not just give them a list to choose from.
---
Alright alright alright alright alright.
---
People who kill you in PvP cannot loot items from you.
---
Dungeons at that low a level are piss easy. I have yet to run into one where threat actually matters. 
---
My buddy plays dps tank warrior and just spams taunt. Otherwise its just a free for all where most of us don't take much damage.
---
So do you go through the effort of installing wholib to get the levels or were you grouped with those people?
---
He looks like he's having fun to me. That's called winning.
---
Eh...  minmaxers were always gonna get there insanely fast and power through the raids no matter what. Layering and the dungeon farming only sped it up by a few days. For the majority of us normies we're still enjoying the game as intended, so it doesn't matter imo.
---
&gt; wasnt the entire reason for Classic the nostalgia?
---
That was never the point.
---
You have insane health regen at level 10. You also benefit from + stats at an insane rate. A LVL 10 rogue with agility enchants and gear will have 80%+ dodge &amp; crit. You can crush LVL 30s thanks to it.
---
It does but this sub is filled with WoW diehards who refuse to open their eyes to other games
---
My boy Cdew doing it right.  He’s entertaining as fuck.
---
Cocky, knowledgeable, and hated by minority big enough that they will watch his every stream because they hate him so much. I generally enjoy his personality on stream and how often people fall for his baits.
---
As a hunter I spent nearly 2 hours last night hunting for “the rake”. Felt soooooo good when I finally tamed it! That’s a true hunter milestone right there
---
dps don't pay attention to such trifles, their job is to be #1 on the damage meter.
---
Its Dire Maul, unless in Westfall general chat. That is all.
---
It is cool with a group though. Grouped up for that cave with the stupid gem with the low droprate. We murdered so many enemies. And these guys drop wool, so I could get my first aid skill up nicely as well.
---
Druids and pallies are hybrid classes that can fill dps, tank or heal roles, but I wouldn't really say they're similar to shamans.
---
Just play Horde =D
---
Most of frostmourne and the crowns powers have to do with creating and controlling undead. It can also steal souls too, and it cuts through flesh and armor really well, but other than that it's never been shown to do anything else that other cool magic swords do. Illidan is kind of in the same boat. Arthas does defeat Illidan post skull of Gul'dan but while both Illidan and Gul'Dan are incredibly powerful Demon Hunter/Warlock respectively, ultimately they're both lesser beings compared to Ragnaros. More interesting, sure, but not more powerful, or really even on the same scale.
---
With the help of the scourge there's no question that Arthas could defeat Ragnaros in his weakened state, and probably even if he was at the peak of his power, but alone I don't think he would do very well swinging Frostmourne at the base of a 60 foot tall vortex of flame.
---
this post was so cringe lmao, quit being so dramatic
---
Most rotations in classic are 1 button or auto attack and 1 button.
---
There’s something about doing a “world first” on a rerelease game that just rubs me the wrong way. Just enjoy the game and take it in slow
---
I didn't realize how bad it was until I ran some dungeons with guildmates tonight, wow what a difference it makes when you have time to get aggro!
---
Not sure to be honest. 
---
What if you run wow via the exe itself in the classic folder in your battle.net folder? Any difference?
---
And that's the issue, it doesn't auto track right away, hence the addon https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auto-track-quests
---
I’ll try that! Thanks
---
Your own independent testing eh?  Care to share?
---
It goes against known testing.
---
Oh my bad on that one
---
Skeram alliance?? 
---
You’re a brave soul
---
Locks come out ahead at the very highest raids after they are geared.  Personally I chose mage because of the food/water, portals, and I don't like pets or soul shard mechanic.  My friend would have to farm shards before raids so he had ample supply.
---
Lol that's literally how it is in classic
---
It only gets better my friend. Once you hit 40+ the world starts opening up and quests taking you across the world to do various things are common place.
---
You can enjoy someone's content dspite their political beliefs. I'm really left learning and it doesnt bother me.
---
i would play horde, but all 6 friends are on alliance :(
---
Thematically Druids are by far the closest
---
Paladin is closer utilitywise though, some would argue better depending on the situation
---
UBRS and LBRS are literally the same dungeon.
---
... this is sad...
---
Asmogold is making entertainment for money nowadays. His passion for wow  is long gone what is left are traces of it which he uses to maintain the facade otherwise the money will stop.
---
who said they did that in vanilla?  it wasnt even a planned thing
---
It really just means you could have done the dungeon without a tank at all haha. Not a bad thing really. I was running stocks with 3 rogues and a cat druid from 24-28. That wasn't the plan but we were clearing it so fast and getting so much xp we just kept going.
---
warrior, mage, mage, priest, priest with both priests spamming holy nova is also very good.
---
I super understand what you mean. It hurts even more when you're in discord with you're friends and you tell them not to attack anything because I need to get aggro and they just start attacking like 3 seconds after engaging. They obviously have never played a warrior
---
Yeah, 1440p 1ms 144hz.
---
Not after two years, maybe. After ten? it makes sense for people to want something else. Blizzard is notorious for having intense work hours, and some
---
of these developers are getting a bit older.
---
lol I got invited into a quest yesterday. I was hunting down some Defias members and the group was going after bandanas. I stuck around long after I got my kills because one of them needed and made sure the group who invited me got their bandanas. One of them stayed behind because someone new joined the group, but over all they were great.
---
And just tonight I was doing a quick quest and got invited to a group, I wasn't even doing the same quest as them but passed around Healthstones and helped them with one mob of NPCs before having to call it a night. People in Classic are just nicer and I really don't think I'm going back to retail.
---
Haha are we outnumbered? It feels like there is a lot of alliance
---
So this shouldn’t be happening to, because I don’t stream? 
---
None of these things were actively happening to these guys.  This shit only got said after they started exploiting the bug, to defend them exploiting the bug.  Basically, what you keep doing.
---
Maybe that's it. Started a new toon on Grobbulus and it seems much more social.
---
Gotten ninja looted twice today
---
I understand your point, but what reward does classic give other than killing harder mobs or letting your hand go and not shine objective items like it is a lamp. It feels more rewarding to beat a board for 1 minute just to kill it, not like in retail 2 punch, but other than that I don't see more reward.
---
You are spot on. Don’t question your stream of thought. They are trash, everyone knows it. No skill, and no intelligence because all they do is sit in twitch with a bunch of uneducated morons sucking their sack all day. What have they done that’s mildly interesting outside of gaming? Pass. Hard.
---
I honestly rather play a character to max level in classic than on retail. Just because the classic experience is so much more fun in leveling.
---
Anyone can see the difference between 1080p and 5K...
---
But the FPS meme has to stop, the human eye cannot see the difference between frame rates.
---
https://i.imgur.com/bUReAYR.jpg
---
Both have their positives and negatives, but I started with classic back in 2004 and seeing how casualized(not sure if that’s even a real word) retail wow has become over the past few xpacs, it’s a breath of fresh air to go back to a more hardcore version of wow. That’s just my opinion though, many prob feel the same, maybe prob think the complete opposite.
---
Also, only a 40+ min queue? That’s cute
---
Who?
---
That's not what this post is about
---
It's Molten Core.  It's literally the raiding tutorial.
---
Why are you reposting this
---
I actually have an addon that does this plus much more, it's called Necrosis and I very highly reccomend it.
---
Been playing for 14 years, played BfA until classic launched. The game has become nothing like it started out as. LFG completely destroyed realm community over the course of it's introduction. You either do endgame raids or hardcore PVP or you feel no sense of award. RNG is the most shittiest thing to put into a game as it gives people who do the raids no real end goal to works towards. The game is not what it once was and classic gives people an end goal to work towards, you feel more powerful as you level and gear up, theres no RNG, world pvp can be wild as shit when it happens, no flying, vanilla and TBC were my favorite times in the game, with WOTLK started the downfall even though I still play.
---
You're right. Raiding and PVP were the end game of Vanilla.
---
Cheaper? You can’t even buy off-race mounts if you aren’t exalted with that reputation. It’s a *lot* of grinding if you skip the leveling rep.
---
All pets have normalized dmg now so doesn't really matter but, broken tooth for pvp and then you might want a wolf with howl from lbrs. Third is whatever
---
From what you've said I think you should. I played vanilla on a PvE server and unless you go looking for it then there is no PvP.
---
I'm on a PvP server now. I've settled on 2 characters that are currently both at level 14. Just a heads up but if you're on a PvP server you have to choose a faction. You can't play both Horde and Alliance on PvP like you can on PvE.
---
Lupos was doing shadow dmg in earlier patches which made it good but not anymore
---
rekt
---
23/warlock/ 1 day 4 hours. Having a lot of fun but played way too much these past 3 days so now I think I need to take a day or two off so I don’t get burnt out
---
No, I’m pretty sure it’s Dan Mleef. The quest is all about killing Dan Mleef, and there’s really no other reason to do the dungeon.
---
I can’t tell if you’re joking, but there’s a difference between resistances and spells not hitting (which will still say resist)
---
I know.
---
Only if you compare the speedruns.
---
He said there would be a satisfying amount of PvP in the PvE servers so I shouldn't worry about it too much. I only game for 1-2 hours a day due to work/school so I think he was trying to spare me from the very committed PvP players or something
---
Thanks so much!
---
oh dude you'll be fine doing rfc at 15, don't worry.
---
WC is a terrible 2nd dungeon to try tanking because of all the nature resist. Don't do it until you're at least 21.
---
He did a prot paladin run of stratholme for certain, where he talked about its strength and weaknesses compared to warriors.
---
He is funny, has great viewer interaction, talks his mind. I love watching his streams, he has another flow compared to other streamers and can keep going with the same energy for hours.
---
Don't you own a desk?
---
Can we stop pretending like it's 2006? Things are very different today from how they were back then. I mean, the guy had more than 200k people watching him at launch, how do you expect him to play the game normally then?
---
Why can't you just let him enjoy the game the way he wants, and you play the game the way you want to play it?
---
Because you're not forced to do anything, if you want to dip back into retail you save money, if not then don't lol.
---
2 hours later it's at 7k, unbelievable. Asmongold will laugh at this all the way to the bank. Pathetic.
---
Reward:gold building towards that mount at lvl 40 EXP every lvl matters you feel your character get stronger every time you get a new talent point whenever you get a new piece of armor
---
Lol but dont paladins get it already for free
---
Who gives a fuck? Why is this sub so obsessed with how other people enjoy the game. Are you on his server? If you are, you should've known what you're signing up for. If you aren't, well, how he plays the game doesn't impact you at all. Enjoy the game how you want to, and stop caring what streamers are doing. For as much as this place hates streamers, you guys sure do love obsessing over them.
---
blizzard follow apple but people would ask why you announce subscription or device selling count when its all time high and not when all time low.
---
I remember a dwarf-only guild I was a part of on Light's Hope. May be the same dude, he's like 15 iirc and just really thinks dwarves are super cool. Not a particularly cool dude imho, but he isn't bad. Just an annoying 15yo lol
---
40min queue time is very short.
---
Got a different question - more where to play, than what to play.
---
So I wanted to play pvp realm, but my friends went to RP realm. It's gonna be tough to deal with no world pvp, but I not even sure how BG gonna be like. Do ppl play BGs on RP servers? Are there going to be cross-realm BGs?
---
If you don't enjoy PvP roll on a PvE server. Classic will be just as much fun for you and there is also going to be some world pvp happening at least during the first two phases. Later this will probably mostly be restricted to battlegrounds. The main difference between the server types is that you cannot kill or get killed by other players while questing. This adds an additional thrill, but mostly for players who actually like PvP, for others it might be only annoying.
---
Some people think of the famous open world battles in crossroads and tarren mill that happened at the beginning of Vanilla. They roll on pvp servers to experience this, but this actually happened and will happen on PvE servers as well. Release of battlegrounds will make this much more rare on both server types.
---
Almost as bad as the number 1 twitch streamer for classic right now
---
They could add expansions but scale it all to 60 so there's no more levels, just better gear.
---
It's racist but in a fun gamey way.
---
&gt;Feel like people didn't really want classic at all.
---
SuprisedPikachu.jpeg
---
I always pick the 'good' side so alliance all day for me
---
This is totally subjective, I put time and money into bfa and I dont regret it.
---
This hasn’t been my experience at all this far; I have almost only seen the best parts that made Vanilla great as far as the community goes.
---
For me the feeling of fresh air and old times feeling was missing when I started playing, so classic is just as new for me as retail.
---
Hmm, I suppose that could be it.  If i was hitting it on gcd, i wouldnt expect it to work at all though.
---
Come to blameaux, I've only been stuck in queue twice and it wasn't for long. Still a good sized population. Plus you get to call your server blammo to other people.
---
Rep farming in Vanilla was only for a few things, and it fuckin sucked.
---
Wait are there monks in retail?
---
I agree 100%, All this fix is doing now is hurting the ones that didn't partake. Now they're even further behind.
---
They're all great! Faerlina has a bunch of streamers (less great, unless you're into that sort of thing), Herod and Stalagg have big dedicated PvP populations, and the rest are steadily growing. If you are looking to *avoid* queues my recommendation would be to try out Bigglesworth.
---
Nah if you like grinding on the same quests every day only to get some box that will give you 5k of gold and some toy that you already got  then it’s fine
---
"none of my friends wanna swap servers!"
---
meanwhile one of these dudes is probably begging them to swap servers so they can actually play.
---
I want to run either hunter or druid and would like to know the best race/faction/spec etc. for solo play
---
Me three.
---
You are right. Punkrat has some good content, but he's not on the Classic WoW CC chill list.
---
I totally agree. Last night (I never watch his stream) I popped in to look how the big names are playing Classic. And I saw 10 people cleaving trough Zul Farrak.
---
Like, isn't that exactly what you do on retail?
---
How? They’re giving you free shit...
---
My initial level cap experience in early 2005 was people zerging the level cap dungeons with 10-20 people because players were so bad no one could clear them with 5. Everyone completed the quests by dropping group just before the boss died to get credit or dropping group to click a quest item. I had a set group of 5 that would do Strath live side to split Righteous Orbs and Large Brilliant Shards to sell, and it was a huge point of pride for us that we could efficiently 5 man a dungeon that most people on the server insisted on taking 10+ people to. It was the entire reason Blizzard implemented the dungeon caps to begin with: hardly anyone at max level was actually doing dungeons as intended, so no one was actually learning how to do then properly or getting better at the game.
---
I'll check this out a home, thanks
---
Been questing this whole time to level 36(except I did deadmines twice). Finally decided to join a dungeon for SM Armory. It was a shit show of low skilled players in a raid of 10 trying to AOE a 5th of the instance at a time. The tank didnt let the healers get mana, one the mages was spamming fire,frost,and arcane bolts. Also using Arcane Explosion on Herod, while being out of range for it to do any damage. It was just a shit show of twitch tv viewers who had little idea on how to properly run a dungeon. Watch out for these players when they get to other dungeons. They will not know how anything works.
---
It’s like they sense your presence and just go do stupid shit.
---
I’ve probably raised like 50 warriors from the dead now.
---
If it isn't mechanically hard, what is it then? Mentally hard because it's so boring and easy?
---
Besides, stop with your lies. Most hardcore guilds spent 2-3 weeks killing mythic azshara, am I to believe that some non-retail player casually strolled through her? Come on, at least be honest if you want to have an argument, or by the very least keep it realistic.
---
I all of the sudden care about Classic..
---
Get ready for him ti play the victim
---
Mark targets. If you have a mage mark an enemy to be sheeped, focus on skull mark.
---
Sorry new to wow. What does dm mean?
---
THE FUTURE!
---
Oh no.
---
I doubt they actually got banned? I've had names on retail like prostatepwnr, colonconqueror, uncleurethra, for years. The only thing that happens is when I pvp a bit too much, I'll get enough reports to have  my name changed.
---
At the moment I have prostateplow and "ErectileFarts of the four winds". With a title like that, you know they wanted names with "fart" in them.
---
Just look at Destiny like WoW with even more instancing and less stats. But yeah, like someone said, netcode is netcode. The "client is boss over its own movement" is very similar.
---
Sad, but I'm glad people like him are failing Classic because they were super elitist and thought they knew everything.
---
Thx
---
Thank you. I'm learning so much from this subreddit. I've spent more time reading than playing today haha
---
Haha APES did not abuse either of those things.
---
The burning crusade expac. Introduced Shaman class for Alliance, and Pallys for Horde.
---
The Bob Ross of WoW is what I call him.
---
Youtube has been trying to push this guy on me die a while, who is he.
---
and JESUS CHRIST WHERE THE HELL IS MANKRIK'S WIFE
---
Congratz! What level are you?
---
The longer you wait to join a pvp server the higher the chance will be for you to be ambushed.
---
If you like PVP go PVP
---
Level 17 Warlock, 17 hours and 13 minutes atm. Having a blast, a few quests have pissed me off but not enough to sour the entire experience. Probably could be higher level for my play time but my level path has been... sub optimal.
---
If you admit to being a scumbag then you shouldn't be shocked that people are going to see you as a scumbag
---
op was so cringe..
---
My impression of alot of complainers here are that they are just as obnoxious as Asmongold. Why whine about it here? Whats that going to accomplish?
---
Classic WoW has some of the worst gatekeepers on the internet. There is no correct experience. He can't have a regular person's experience because of who he is. Let him play the game as he sees fit to get to the content he wants to stream.
---
I feel awkward just shouting at them for a buff they cant have outside of party, but it's the thought that counts.
---
Seriously, right before old talent system was removed I didn't feel like that, but now, damn it is nice.
---
Agree with you 100% in classic people wave at each other and I teamed up numeros time with random people just to kill a few murlocs that was too strong for me alone.
---
Sounds like a retail baby
---
Looking for this as well!
---
While I do agree! I want to hit 69 to start working on my pre-raid BiS healer gear and I need loot from so many different dungeons with pretty low drop rates so the sooner I can work on that the better I say. But yes I'm loving the adventure. Lvl 30 currently in 1k needels and in loving it so much. Loved the unflodded zone so much
---
Epic meme
---
I know you're right but I'm so excited for STV that I'm going there immediately to take a gorilla
---
5 man is optimal speed with an ideal setup afaik. Even without you'll pull good or even fantastic numbers comparee to questing (unless you are maybe an insane solo leveler with lots of practice and class like hunter).
---
Lul someone is mad
---
this one
---
does he not get a hundred people to help him? 
---
That works both ways. Also if he picked a pvp server that issint even worth mentioning.
---
i dont get it
---
Wait a month and you'll get more.  People are still trying to use pally tanks.  They'll eventually figure out the warrior is far superior and that's when it'll be constant whispers to tank shit.
---
They already increased realm pops in oce because we fuck too hard down under. I would of thought they did the same in na and eu?
---
That’s how I remember it. Hell I remember every global chat in all versions of the game having daily political discussions.
---
Day9 seems like a good dude even if I only know him from the little bit he did with Dota
---
Cats have the highest attack speed and can learn Bite and Claw,
---
Wind Serpents can cast lightning from far and are safe,
---
Wolf's can buff melee's.
---
Why's that?
---
Yeah, I’m only level 20, but I follow the LFG channel, and as a tank seeing all the sp groups it was unsettling. Partly because I am too lazy to learn new strats, partly because I wanted to do dungeons in a slower pace, nostalgia style. I’m relieved I missed it.
---
Now if we could get the chat garbage out of the lfg channel
---
Damn..hold up am I the only one who generally don't watch streamers? I mean Ill watch lets plays but meh..
---
The judgement realm has lots of allies
---
It does, in a way. Chances to get in a scarlet group are way lower if you don't fit in the meta. Luckily they fixed raid xp for the dungeons.
---
I fished out a bunch of cloth from some floating ... debris? Turns out it was enough to immediately craft few woolen bags. Pretty cool!
---
Yeah they are packed because its only been 5 days, in month they will be dead.
---
Same thing though. r1 es on second bar, max rank on main bar. I use shift for bar 2, ctrl for bar 3, alt for bar 4, and all my buttons are /cast \[form:0\] healing touch;\[form:1\] growl etc etc. It'd be possible to run out of buttons this way on a warrior, but no chance on a druid.
---
Isn't that cooperation at least?
---
Disable it in BGs then.  
---
Leave it enabled in World PvP.  That'd be another layer of surprise.
---
Because convincing all your leveled friends to jump into a new server is impossible
---
You don't have to do them fully. I helped a pally friend get their fist. I'm a 22 lock he's a 24. We managed to take out a couple bosses, but no way could we do the full dungeons.
---
You all took the bait...
---
Nah, I wouldn't say so. The classic developers FILLED WoW with world building/background lore.
---

---
So I doubt they put this in the game for the sword of sargeras reason you mentioned below. But its still a cool place. We do go back to it in BFA.
---
Hit Escape button, click Macros, click New.
---
Thank you for the great feedback. I'll look into the druid :)!!
---
If this lines up with 9.0 and class redesigns(aka the great unpruning) I can see this actually being really cool.
---
Yup seen that a lot.
---
Remindme! 5 hours
---
I know people will probably mention it but I loved that ever time an MMO was announced specifically remembering rift/gw2/eso people said these would be wow killers and although I love gw2 I don't think it killed wow :)
---
Yeah, IMO the worst kind of people are the elitiests on the "casual" end of the spectrum.
---
They're the ones who act like people who're rushing to 60 are wrecking the game and the true players take their time and only play a few hours a week.
---
Let's face it, those people aren't even going to be playing in a few months time and will move onto the next fad, I wish people would just keep to discussing the game itself and not their opinion of how the game has to be played.
---
Ah come on, now you are looking for reasons.

My Wife plays balance and Im a bear. If you want to go the spellcasting route I would put your points in balance. Your healing will be fine and you will do more damage than having extra points in resto. You even get a mana discount on heals and damage in the same talent further down making the hybrid play better.
---
Big downside: Retail players will now play classic just to level up and then quit. I'd rather they just not play at all if they are only using classic as a stepping stone to advance their retail account.
---
If you are single target leveling, you don't need improved blizzard. The thing is, with the AOE build, you aren't really missing much besides Frostbite, you will still do perfectly fine single target
---
If you dont have a bunch of friends playing on one server i would go for a server without the Long que times!
---
Im currently playing on Firemaw EU. i think at one point atleast it was the highest populated server. And the que time is unbearable, people downloaded Teamviewer or other programs to not get DC or to que while at Work so it's ready when home.(which often wasnt so successfull as you would Hope) 
---
The reason why im on that server is because we are 10+ friends that are playing there. 
---
The other option is to wait for Blizzard to upgrade the servers, again. Or to wait for the hype to die down and then start playing when the queue isnt multiple hours. 
---
Good luck on picking a server, Hope this was to some help.
---
Do you have any proof that they're the same people???
---
Every level sure is an adventure, you have to walk and look around what new stuff can you do and go to trainers to get the new ability, unlike in retail.
---
Control your party.  Mark your targets.  Coordinate Cc.  Ask for single target dps on your target when possible. 
---
The first mob will be the hardest to hold, consecration is going to make it easier and easier to hold subsequent mobs.  
---
Judgement of the crusader -&gt; consecration -&gt;seal of righteousness -&gt; judgement of righteousness.   Repeat steps 2-4 until cleared.  It will get more complicated, but for now that’s a pretty solid rotation.
---
he is the walking taling retail wow player stereotype  
---
only times i see him is when he gets roasted in youtube highlights contradicting himself Hardcore **ALWAYS** with a smug look of his reading the REEE spam of 10s of thousands of teenagers
---
no it is not.
---
His army of fans also help him.  That works both ways.
---
In this thread: Retailers hating Classic players.   
---
Not in this thread: Classic players hating retailers.
---
What the hell are you two talking about? Weapon speed and damage was normalized expansions later than vanilla. What you see in a weapon's tooltip is what you get. If a weapon says it deals 10-20 damage and you use a 150% weapon damage attack, the yellow damage will be 15-30. If the weapon speed says 1.7, it's going to cause white damage every 1.7 seconds.
---
See the problem is, people only talk about raids. WoW is not just raids. WoW only became super raid focussed in WOTLK onwards. How many people have seen high tier raids in BC? like 0.5% of the playerbase. This means for 99% of the playerbase, there were a lot of things going for them that weren't raids.
---
This focus on raids is the core of what is wrong with retail WoW.
---
If it's a choice between letting a DPS die or letting a Tank die, the DPS dies. Sorry.
---
ikr, why give poison to kids asking for candy
---
I expected nothing less of him. Just wait for him to ninja all the loot in his MC run where everyone carriers him.
---
Who is this Asmongold and why do people watch him? He looks very creepy and mentally unstable to me.
---
Retail sucks its not a mmo rpg
---
[Atlas World Map Classic](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/atlas-world-map-classic/)

This should also show dungeon maps
---
I’d make your main mining instead with tailoring and then make your alt blacksmith and enchanting, that way you can farm all your mats for blacksmith on your main and send them to them plus any greens you make from tailoring. Then blacksmithing helps you with enchanting also with any extra greens you make. Lots of good pre raiding gear from blacksmithing plus you can enchant all your gear with tank stats as a bonus. It will take a lot of time and money but once you get them to 300 it will be worth it IMO.
---
You can't really destroy all of the content that was mixed recieved. We have an opportunity to do it better with what we know now. Make it a voting booth like osrs.
---
It's fine to say that you're not happy waiting but stating that its broken isnt right.
---
If a train isnt coming frequently enough for your personal preference, it isnt broken. Its a characteristic of that train's schedule. You work with it, or around it. The train might even be working as hard as it can, within the bounds of the infrastructure, other schedules, a budget, etc.
---
People are already complaining that there are too many layers/shards, which is a solution to get more people into a realm. Some people are even complaining that the new realms that have been created (due to insane queue times) will cause problems later on, when populations die out. Point is, it's conplicated. There is no "right" solution and its far from broken.
---
I highly recommend that you just pre-queue. Theres different ways to do this, but this could be as simple as teaching a family member to do it on your behalf.
---
Although I dont exactly want to encourage people logging in and afking (which contributes to longer queues), the game is pretty forgiving. It will let you idle for a while and even after being booted, rejoining within a few minutes bypasses the queue.
---
So yeah. Just prequeue for the next couple of weeks. The population will likely die down.
---
Last alternative, if you think theres a better solution (e.g. a premium pass to get high priority in the queue), then let Blizzard know.
---
I always said, I want TERA combat with WoW dungeons and story with BDO graphics and life skills, plus a big economy (thinking a Eve but that might be a little too crazy).
---
Meanwhile I enjoy playing the game for myself. Who puts this much of themselves into what some other person does while playing the game? Get a grip and enjoy it however you think you're "supposed" to enjoy it....
---
&gt; Never got the end game so, I don't know about the slot mashines and stuff.
---
bruh.mp4
---
Here's the deal. You don't know why retail sucks ass yet and you also don't know why classic is fantastic yet. You need to have played these games for a decent amount of time in order to know why things are good. They're not 10 hour games, they're thousand hour games. When I said I played BFA for 35 days, I meant I literally have 35 days of logged time on just my main.
---
The issues do not come down to just retail having more features, it's about the core design of classic being a community oriented experience and retail making that optional. It's about retail's world content having zero danger to the player. It's about giving people heroic raid gear for doing trivial content. It's about gear drops randomly procing to significantly more powerful versions.
---
That's why I loved WoW 15 years ago, that's why I fell in love with Soulsborne, that's why I lost interest in Assasin's Creed. Good games don't need to be easy, accessible to everyone or constantly entertaining. Good games need to be rewarding, mystical and most of all: engaging.
---
Dude he is a streamer, there is a huge difference between streamers and us. He's trying to make it look fun for the viewers and gain money on it, that's it. Turn off his stream and go play the game.
---
Let people fucking play the game how they want too, if you wanna level up killing boars, great! If you wanna farm SM, do it! You shouldn’t care if people are playing is differantly from you, get over yourself.
---
I am happy to see this person recommended.
---
Classic players can't be greedy? Wtf
---
Is Classic fun for casual players? I played a ton from vanilla to WotLK but I don't have the time to do that anymore, so are there any casual players out there who are having a genuinely good time? I like retail because I can make decent progress while relaxing and listening to podcasts while playing.
---
3 days and lvl 60 nice blizzard .
---
I have no idea, and that wasnt really my point.
---
It's definitely going to mess up the classic community if this is true. I'm very disappointed that Blizzard is doing this. They stated before that they wanted to keep modern and classic separate, and this is completely against that.
---
Holy crap I thought I was the only one that did this
---
How do you even know those people will be the ones complaining there's nothing to do? The ones who hit max or are nearing max already are the ones who played on vanilla private servers for years, they know what the content is
---
Kargoz is a content creator gem. His videos on YouTube are some of the most in depth and informative videos on classic. He single handedly got me hyped and prepared.
---
I played a Night Elf Rogue in classic 15 years ago. I had absolutely no problems topping damage meters in my guild and kicking ass. 
---
If you like PvP, Shadowmeld stacks with stealth and makes you that much harder to see. 
---
If you’re into bleeding edge min maxing then racials matter I suppose, but only a tiny base of the population would actually care for that:
---
I bet he is using Rockbiter too.
---
I was watching Taliesin yesterday and he is level 22 and chasing alliance scum around the world with a group of guildies. They did a dungeon too and then some quests. Awesome stream!
---
Looking up the Dunning-Kruger effect it seems to be hotly refuted and not regarded well as a theory. Was that what you were getting at?
---
I swear I could place traps while in combat way back when.  I feel like I never use my traps now.
---
Horizontal progression
---
96 hours in 1 week is pretty insane. I haven't had that kind of free time since I was in High School.
---
I heard they did increase the realm pops, but not nearly enough. Still seeing queues of 10-20k. I just got home around 10:30pm and the queue was at 8k.
---
Ive been wanting to play the game, but the server my friend is on is PVP with a high population with a long wait time (He said its usually around 3 hours). Has Blizzard mentioned any plans on how to fix or counter this issue of long queue times? Also if the world is a PVP world does that mean I can be attacked by other players wherever I am in the world? And if I die from other players what items will I lose?
---
Is guidelime auto? Does it check to see what quests you've done and Mark off progress?
---
Oh man as a warlock that's the only on the go buff i can give, too bad i wasn't there :(
---
Searching newegg and found a few and narrowed down to this refurb. Thoughts? Should be plenty to run on lower settings I think.

---
I knew these numbers weren't right as a hardcore vanilla player, but every time you point out something in classic isn't like vanilla people just scream that you are remembering it wrong and that vanilla was just super easy.  
---
These players of course usually haven't actually played vanilla.
---
Practice in Rage Fire Chasm first. You can get a hang of the mechanics there before a harder dungeon. Mostly you'll be just using Maul, as swipe burns through Rage way to fast early on. Just tab through targets and keep mauling. Learn to protect the healer first and foremost. If DPS dies they can be rezed. Guard the healer!
---
Yea I mean classic is beyond full right now so I’m sure they are flooded with tickets, sorry you had to deal with a scum person like that
---
I only ever watch twitch when doing something else—cooking, painting, playing in the other monitor, etc
---
because it probably reminds them of a time when life was better
---
We did Onyxia with a shadow priest tanking. Unironically better and easier than the paladin tank, bear tank, paladin DPS and druid DPS kills.
---
So true, whenever I'm doing a long run I smash Alt+z and play "World of Camera AngleCraft"
---
4 warriors and a shaman. Everyone gets loot and it's super quick.
---
I didn't get a letter, but the other day I spent a fair few hours with this mage I originally grouped up with to do the Hillsbrad peasants/Hillsbrad skulls quests with and we ended up going all the way to the Dun Garok elite quests and some other quests.  
---
He then had to HS to buy skills and went afk to help his dad or something. I stayed in the group for a while but then someone else was LFG for some other quest I was doing so I said bye and thanks in party chat and dropped the group. A little later he whispered me to tell how much he had had doing all the quests with me and I replied in kind.  
---
Then later the same day I was in Thousand Needles questing and saw his corpse in the Boiling Elemental pool and I felt genuinely sad (add "look how they massacred my boy" meme here). Then a few minutes later someone was LFG for the Test of whatever questline and I asked to join, got invited and was instantly greeted with a "(my char name) &lt;3&lt;3" by the very same mage. Spent another couple hours questing with him and some other randos and ended with adding him as a B.net friend.
---
This is the community I loved and missed.
---
Killing the sense of community so you can run your dungeons (not even raids) just  a bit faster.
---
I've thoroughly enjoyed watching Staysafe. He's been grinding away like a beast 2 manning everything, fighting sleep like a champ and entertaining all the way. Imo he has done it right. Azmongold is a fool and I've got no idea how her has so many viewers
---
they do it because its a click bate title to get more views
---
Asmongold has never been good at the game why did you expect anything else lmao. He's literally swifty 2.0 in a decade long game which is worse.
---
I remember him saying when he people traded gold in retail before classic "btw guys i wont take gold in classic untill i get lvl 60 mount on my own" now i read this and im like bruhh..
---
It's a really dumb take you think people giving him money are the same people ganking him.
---
Groups are full usually and there are multiple groups.
---
90-100 WOD leveling is the absolute worst stretch of it IMO.
---
Iirc pets were normalized during vanilla.
---
Thnx but no thnx! Missed too many expansions and stuff to even remotely fellow the storyline, new features and mapping. Time for Wow2!
---
Gnomes are best mages, I chose human.  No regrets.
---
Yeah I struggle to see how people rushing to 60 affects my enjoyment of the game at all. If anything they're drawing more subscribers, which will lead to more people playing long term (even if most quit after the first month or two).
---
I was doing the quest to kill the skeletal mages/raiders etc and I was level 31 at the time and I been able to fight 2-3 at a time and so I was half mana moon fired a raider and tabbed and moonfired Mor'ladim... Luckily a warrior who needed to kill him asked to party up so I was able to invite him to the party and we just kited him to death. He hamstringed him I moonfired when it was up we went around in a circle for half the graveyard until he died. It was fun
---
Muttanus the devourer in wc and the satyr in rfc is called bazzalan
---
3) You want something tough and tanky. My personal favorite is the boar. Charge is awesome for getting to the mob quickly and building threat fast. And boars are pretty tough.
---
Bears are also great tanks. 
---
Gorillas are great AOE tanks as they do a thunderclap like warriors.
---
Belt? Leather belt?
---
Yup, him and Stiches, forcing lowbies off the road since 2004.
---
I mean I also farmed Scarlet Monastery
---
as a Warrior tank
---
in a 5 man group
---
with different people after 2-3 runs
---
just to get Ravager after like 30 runs Armory
---
I didnt do it for the Exp only, I just really want the whole scarlet set (3/6 atm)
---
Na if you were to give an enchanted all crusader mats and he dipped there would deff be consequences, they would interfere if you tried to pull that stuff for sure.
---
do you think they should care if you relate to them? I can't relate to people who read quests but like, who cares what I can't relate to lol
---
Paladin are the alliance counterpart. They provide many buffs and strong single target healing.
---
Some people are experiencing it for the first time
---
&gt;I wouldn't say its shitty, it's just a older and differant design philosophy.
---
If the design philosophy is to have players give up on group play for normal quests then they certainly succeeded.
---
Nah, seriously, what were they thinking not having things like fucking hoves drop from every mob for everyone?
---
[I don't believe you at all? Never once looked at this tab?](https://i.imgur.com/KtA37Zd.png)
---
Yea when I realize how slow leveling is in classic 10 minute Rez sickness seems like nothing
---
You zoomers habe no selfcontainment.
---
I think you guys are being a bit too harsh. What I can agree on is when they go ”CAN I GET THAT?”or actually beg for stuff. Or abuses their streamer previleges. 
---
But, the classic experience you talk about is not possible for these streamers. The only way they can experience it is by playing off-stream. And they probably do this on some alternative character or even alternative account. They will always have these fanboys who does whatever in their power to give them money and items. Probably give them so much gold that they go poor, just for that 5 second fame.
---
Not sure about the timeframe, but happy cake day!
---
If you can find evidence to support these claims of him saying "I won't ask for money or items" then please provide
---
I'm just waiting. It's 5 gold to upgrade alch or herb to Artisan. Right now I'm saving up for my mount at level 40 so I don't want to spend the 10 gold just yet.
---
It's the bandwagon effect. "I'm playing classic wow. Which streamer has the most viewers? They must be good, I'll watch them"
---
I bought one on the ah for 5g. Gonna try and buy the only other one tomorrow and make a profit.
---
In addition Warrior stacking is insane now there were 15 warriors inAPES, 13 in Progression, and 15 in the Horde Guild that were 1, 2 and 3. Back in Vanilla Progression no one knew Warriors were good for anything except tanking.  Also when we did get to Rag we had to hurt our DPS by equipping FR gear while these Guilds discovered a way to get FR from a mind control buff+potion to mitigate most of the damage so they didn't lose damage on the Rag fight. APES literally had one submersion back in Vanilla prior to the nerfs in full BWL gear you'd still have a 2 submersion fight and the adds had far more health. Just some of the stuff we had looked at as early MC progression vs the 1.12 version in classic.
---
Thanks, it could have been alot worse though
---
I think majority of people playing classic didn't even play retail to begin with. When I tire of classic I'll be going back to other games.
---
Hopefully people still get to play the game they want. From my experience people that were hyped for game in my guild won't play for very long.
---
I played a bit in the stress test, getting to level 5 was a nice trip down nostalgia lane, but it's not the game I want to play these days. Still glad everyone has the chance to experience the game as it was.
---
Ah, my memory failed me.
---
You should google what scoliosis is if you think orcs has it.
---
100 times agreed.  Fuck watching, play the game. Live your own adventure.
---
If it still persists I would turn vsync on and see if that fixes it.
---
He is a huge Trump supporter, it should be no surprise he is a shitty human.
---
According to some people the only thing holding shamans back from tanking raids is actual gear itemized for them to do that
---
These 2 are going to lock you into a faction so you need to decide if you want to play horde or alliance. Once you know that the choice will be made for you.
---
Rumor has it that he played on Mannoroth and loved to troll Trade Chat, but ‘‘tis only a rumor.
---
BFA says it needs at least a GPU with 2gb vram, but I'm roking a 560GTX and it runs like butter still, just no HD textures.
---
Classic will run on a potato from the fridge, on full settings, without a heatsink
---
Can you get banned for facts?
---
Hello fellow adventurer:). Whats the server you r playing on?
---
Like for real, you can run this game on a pretty shitty laptop with a pretty shitty phone hotspot if you need to
---
What are your specs?
---
It’s not a taunt. It doesn’t guarantee you aggro when you use it.
---
I just Charge, Demo Shout/Battle Shout and swap to defensive stance, then start tab targeting and make sure to put a sunder and bleed on everything, taunt whatever goes running and use revenge on anything that hasn't been hit recently.  Try to keep enough rage to interrupt also.
---
 Not much else you can do at RFC levels.
---
Exactly, that's the beauty of it. The rest of us are having fun with the game, who cares what these people are doing? It doesn't really affect anyone else. Classic is a game you can enjoy at your own pace. Whether that pace is rushing to complete everything in a week or just casually playing with friends and not even hitting 60 until a year from now, it's still fun and your achievements still feel meaningful. Classic was always as much about the journey as the destination for a lot of people.
---
Maybe it's different on your server, but now and then in classic skull was always used as the "kill first" mark in raids. It was the same across several servers and regions I played on, the skull dies first. Maybe you're having trouble because you have a lot of people who have the same idea about the skull mark.
---
I've not levelled wrath, starfire etc n yeah. Level the resto and feral whilst caring for your own self
---
Damn didn't know it was that much lol.  Yea save for that mount :) I'm kind of on the fence for saving for mount.. mount is awesome! But I'm a shaman and have 40% 1sec cast ghost wolf... Mount would only make it 20% faster... Still faster though I guess :)
---
How is it not too far gone?
---
is that 110 boost also available to peeps who bought bfa?
---
cause I am still missing a max level shammy
---
My reaction too after I used it :(
---
humans lie to themselves all the time. 
---
gaming is ruined due to elitism and the strive for doing whats best instead of fun. whats easy to do for the reward given.
---
streamers in mmos are notorious for begging for gp/items. To me, it isn't surprising. They honestly expect free things due to the whole psychological scam that is "donations" on streams when they make plenty of money.
---
You are aware someone could easily level 3-4 characters to 110 in the time it takes to get to 60 in classic right?
---
Shadow meld can’t be used in combat.  Atleast not in this patch. It was like that in a private server I played though
---
Feel the Boomer-burn.  Ouch.
---
Lol I see the big brain calls
---
Get it and consider it as an extra mana potion. It WILL help you out in some scenarios: Extra mobs, getting ganked, ganking. 50s is a small price if it can save you a corpse run a couple times.
---
Cry about it.
---
To be fair, SM is a great dungeon.  I spent a lot of time there, even in vanilla.  Most of my time up to lvl 40 in fact, as soon as I could run lib (fuck GY).
---
if you don't like it. stop watching. its simple.
---
Cool.
---
That is literally what made me quit wow. In wotlk it changes to this weird gear score, optimal spec bullshit that killed the whole game for me. every time I checked after it just got worse
---
To be fair I’m horde on PVP and have had a lot of ?? Players just come up and kill me, so it kinda goes both ways..
---
why have people not just spam reported streamer then and got them kicked is my main question but it happened to me?
---
I've deliberately slowed my leveling to make sure my professions remain level appropriate.
---
Its super rewarding, Im wearing a full set of Silvered armour I made myself and Im already gathering mats for Green Iron
---
Yeah but I understand where OP is coming from in some ways.  Asmon did make a big deal that he wasn't going to accept charity in classic until he could afford his own mount and literally gave up after like a day and started accepting gold.
---
Everyone enjoys the game differently. For some, the joy of wow isn't levelling or questing, it's parsing in raids. I don't get it, myself, but I understand.
---
The problem, in my opinion, doesn't come from these people finding a way to enjoy the game. It comes from them whining to blizzard that the game isn't built around their vision, and then blizzard caving in. That's how we ended up in retail.
---
44 warlock,  4 days 6 hours played. Only reason i've played so much is because i love every minute :D
---
Watch me and my brothers 4 man dungeons instead. Way cooler.
---
Fair, but am I supposed to predict these queues when I am not home? Am I supposed to spend more time trying to guess my queues than doing my job? Everyone’s saying I need to remote in and be “ahead of the curve” but I disagree. A game I already pay for shouldn’t become a chore to play in the first place.
---
Attack speeds were normalized in TBC
---
Im on kromkrush and Im pretty sure Ive seen you around actually
---
Welcome to classic :) 
---
But yeah instead of going out with drinking and stuff I just drop the money on the subscription.
---
Pretty cheap for all the entertainment it offers me
---
I work 40 hours a week + 2 nightshifts at weekend and I have 4x sporttraingings a week and im still having a blast as a casual gnome in the world of warcraft! Im about to hit lvl 21
---
Any church ever
---
I have really only used freezing trap, always lay it down before I pull a mob because I always hecking pull something else. My pet tanks the mob I wanted and then I kite the secondary mob to my trap.
---
Immolation trap before I pull a big boi mob and let it run into it then have my pet taunt it, just a lil extra dmg.
---
Saved my ass plenty of times.
---
Wait why doesnt this explain what happend?
---
A few kills here, a few pieces of gold there. He's good.
---
It's neat until you realise the WoW servers would literally crash every single time Asmongold goes out to quest.
---
On Zandalar Tribe EU we managed to nearly crash the server twice now, just by holding pvp events. The first one had Nixxiom and only like 400 participants and the second one had??? Numbers but even without any streamer influence the servers kept freezing for 10 seconds at a time. And thats only for a few hundred people. 
---
No way the servers can handle anything close to Asmongolds 4000 guildies.
---
You can’t use it in combat
---
[Here's a guide on how to make macros :)](https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=128550)

No way anywhere near the majority was doing lvl 30+ SM runs.
---
Wish I would have thought of this
---
I looked it over.. my comment from earlier 
---
I shall be raiding and pillaging ashenvale soon
---
Nothing in RFC is going to one shot a DPS. You just do your best to hold aggro on one or two things and let the group sort out the rest.
---
Holding aggro is really hard before 25 or so, even 30, but the mobs are consequently a lot less dangerous.
---
This is the problem, the spawn rates don't make sense since the technology has moved on to allow so many people on a server. Its like this for both mobs (especially named ones for quests) and quest items you need to click too.
---
I wish they did take the massive difference in population into account when setting up spawn rates on things for classic.

Do you get them from curse forge?
---
You must be a mage. rofl
---
Can only tell my impression in my alliance rppvp server, and that is: lfg chat is 50% someone looking for a tank and 30% for healer. 
---
Just walking near deadmines was asked if wanted to do the dungeon and heal, so yeah...
---
Dude, are you even playing Classic? This game is fun as hell.
---
I've started to play as Orc Warrior to level with my friend, but she can't play as much as I and my other friends so I was thinking - what are the other tank options we have for Horde so I can solo lvl and play with other friends?
---
Personally I think tibia is the greatest mmo of all time.
---
But what wow offers is a game where you can truly experience cooperative content, and it takes away the substantial stress that tibia brings with it. Unless unlike tibia you can still be hardcore in wow and be a functional person (you can still play 20 to 40 hours a week, but unlike tibia it doesn't have to consume your world)
---
What did he do again?
---
Dude calm your tits, it's a fucking game.
---
Also don't shit talk some guys entire person over one thing. That's a slippery slope.
---
The big one here is that Blizzard from 15 years ago is shadowing the Blizzard of today, fuck those guys imho
---
A lot of them are guys that got big creating WoW guides and videos, some before twitch was even a thing. I think that part of the problem is that in the past, they played WoW and managed to turn it into a business. Now they're playing WoW for their business. They can't take the time to do it at their own pace because they have to keep viewers interested. They can't turn down these giant parties because those are their top contributors. They're at the mercy of their customers, and I don't think Vanilla is very conducive to that.
---
2min walk north of zoramgar strand in ashenvale. You'll have to jump down and swim right past the meeting stone. Wowhead has a detailed guide for every dungeon, including how to find the entrance.
---
What a hot take.
---
Tank was and is harder to find than healer. Healer is better than dps, but 90% of groups are just stuck LF Tanks.
---
broken tooth. A rare spawn cat in the badlands(i always get location screwed up) There are a bunch of others with 1.2. See: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php for more info. Reason people go for BT even when ZG is out is that cats do more damage then bats. 1.0 attack speed is more of a PvP thing though as a pets dps is the same regardless of attack speed. A slower attack speed cat will just hit harder per hit. But the higher attack speed makes casters have major pushback on spells and more hits means more chances to crit, but also more chances to miss. Its a tradeoff.
---
Sounds like special treatment, hmmm
---
Defias boys some real killers
---
Asmon is a full blown entertainer. he doesn't wanna be the truest WoW-Player, he cares about his stream to make money from it, it's his damn job, and he's damn good at it!
---
There's other dudes you can watch that won't ruin your classic experience. Just watch MadSeasonShow - don't be hatin'
---
Mana hobo! Is that a real term, it's perfect
---
I think it's really just a virtual circle of friends kind of thing. Most of the people who follow streamers around for hours probably aren't too sociable in real life, so they resort to online communities.
---
Not everything is about efficiency.
---
But how do I convince him that our opinion is better than his?
---
Dude most of the streamers were doing this. Blozz just nerfed it anyways.
---
I doubt it, you would not be able to succeed in high school. My point is adults connects with vanilla more than with retail. 15 years ago skins, instant leveling, pandas and loot boxes did not exist. You could not pay to have an advantage in a game. It's not just about nostalgia, we would like expansions and new games that reward skills and time rather than instant gratification and homogenization.
---
\&gt; We can see by ur post history u never thought this game would fail.  
---
If you look back further in his posting history, he was critical of the state of the game during the beta phase and said the problems wouldn't get fixed, ever.
---
You would spend less time leveling if you just played less and built up rested XP.
---
No, I have not :(
---
Yep, I started playing a rogue, but I kinda want to level a hunter because of the mobility and ease of leveling in general.  Plus mage seems fun because of the aoe farming capabilities, and I played a warrior in vanilla, so I kinda want to roll one.  Oh, and I think warlocks are really cool, and...I think I need help.
---
Lol I mean more like nothing he says is interesting and he’s not good at the game from a technical perspective
---
This is my first time playing WoW at all and I went and made a rogue. I’ve played a lot of MMO’s but this is the hardest one so far. I spend most of my time dead because I can’t seem to outlevel the quests. I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong. 
---
Loving WoW so far. I just didn’t expect this difficulty at low levels
---
You guys have been picking the wrong servers lol, i have yet to have a single queue.. Eu PVE
---
Actively doing something while stating you are against it is being a hypocrite, example: saying you care about the environment while you constantly litter.
---
If you think everyone who changes their mind or does something different from what they originally said is a hypocrite then I'm sure you don't understand the definition of the word.
---
Same with elemental shaman as DPS. Not well enough itemized gear.
---
nobody has 15g to spend on  a blue
---
I'm pretty surey 98% of shit that gets posted on that cesspit is straight up satire, I'm certain BFA is the result of advanced trolling.
---
M-mcconnell??
---
I love Asmongold, God bless him and his friends
---
It’s a skill called beast training. Looks like a slingshot.
---
One of your party members doesn't have maraudon quest - orgasm ruined
---
Where is this wiki? I’m on mobile.
---
It's not the same speed. Theres definitely a penalty for EACH member above 5. It just wasn't enough penalty, apparently.
---
Plus the 10mans were running into the lockout timer. 5mans not, obviously.
---
TL;DR. 10mans were getting *slightly* more than a good 5man.
---
Hey Yinzer. 
---
I'm playing a Horde mage on Benediction currently level 21.  If you are still looking for a buddy anyway, send me a message!  I think we would get along. If you care to know a bit more about me just ask. 
---
Either way,
---
Best of luck!
---
I could see them letting it run for a day. That'd be interesting. Give the CDC more data lol.
---
Pick a lower pop server?
---
How long does it take to hit 60?
---
I don’t disagree. Ideally I’d like them to increase server size and kill layering asap. 
---
All I’m saying is worst case if they don’t increase server cap, just let it breathe for a bit, it will for sure get better. I know it’s frustrating though
---
It does?  I never noticed that setting, which one is it?
---
Me too so I'm having a hard time finding it right now sorry
---
Some dungeons are considered mini-raids (like UBRS) and can be played with more players.
---
It makes a lot of sense to go in a dungeon a bit overleveled. If you go in when stuff is higher level than you it will take forever to kill stuff. You go in when enemies are lower level and you destroy those elites so fast that the exp/hour you get out of it is pretty good.
---
first I was gonna write a heartfull sobbing story about how I am a warrior at 39 with 20 gold and still trying to reach the magical amount, and the struggles I face everytime I go out into the world
---
then I saw and I said "nice"
---
You ARE hot shit my dude, these guys are like speedrunners, they've done this a million times on private realms.
---
You have to be joking right? i was a bit harsh but obviously you didn't tried playing on a 144hz monitor with contant 140 fps, the smoothness is definitely visible
---
Unlike you, metnavman; a true intellectual, who spends his time caring only about worthwhile things like, for example, spamming a thread with replies calling people who enjoy a streamer stupid.
---
hey, what energy addon is that?
---
Most people don't care about having more than one mount.
---
How do I get this?
---
Same with IF in OCE, people were trying to get out of the glitched layer and then other people were giving them shit for it.
---
You are right in warriors being way better tanks, also druids are great at dungeons (not talking about raids here)
---
But tanking with a paladin is way more interesting, for me. Im stacking up on items like https://classicdb.ch/?item=7344 while levelling to have fun at later levels. Ofc Im going to mainly heal but will also tank since I have a group of friends who can be trusted to run with me.
---
The thing about warriors is that they make people be too used to tank being able to hold threat so they dont get used to playing around a slow tps tank.
---
If Cox n' Crendor do a classic series I'll be hooked
---
To be fair to him as well he did complain that this SM farm would be boring but hes basically trying to keep up with the other streamers so he can produce content for his stream at level 60 with them. If he was still level 35 and they were 60 not as many people would be interested.
---
Thanks for digging that up!
---
Yes you are correct too low for STV.
---
I always enjoyed fishing, but I kinda feel like I'm wasting my time doing it. I could do quests, level up and unlock new dungeons, instead I'm sitting on my ass, waiting to click on the bobber like every 20 seconds.
---
That's racist!
---
2 geathering proffesions is lame since you can only track one at the time (unless its skinning +) 
---
in your case i would go alchemy and enchanting on alt. but then again im not vanilla veteran.
---
Couldn’t have said it better myself.
---
I generally loathe Twitch as a platform. Most of the streamers who made a name for themselves simply aren’t entertaining even at the best of times, they lack personality and can’t keep their momentum going throughout a several hour broadcast. Even many of the platform’s biggest names like Ninja are boring to watch a vast majority of the time.
---
The only time I saw a streamer remotely try to keep momentum going throughout a broadcast was a SC2 streamer called Sheezle, who did cheese builds every game, and did a somewhat pre-scripted comedic skit between every match he played. Even then, I don’t think he ever peaked at more than maybe a few thousand viewers at his prime because StarCraft II is a dead game that nobody wants to watch. He also quickly ran out of material after about a week.
---
And don’t get me started on the camgirls who invaded the platform. If you think the way streamers like Asmongold and DrDisrespect ‘bait’ viewers into thinking they’re friends with a subscriber or donor is bad; what if I told you that boobie streamers often play this up to downright exploitative levels? And these are the kind of people who are big on selling their bodies via Patreon with $30 per month private Snapchats.
---
Twitch is meant to be a gaming livestream platform and isn’t a porn site; yet given how the site has policed titty streamers slutting it up on camera in direct violation of the ToS, it may as well be,
---
I just want an easy way to like 25. I hate the lowest levels. So boring.
---
Hiho this website is still offline  [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/)  ? Any news ?
---
greetings Flück
---
Zandalar went from 5k or more to a few hundred to 1.5k. Much more tolerable.
---
You use it in dungeons when you are tanking to generate threat.
---
More like fixed, it was a bug.
---
I feel this pretty strongly, been on and off Tibia for 15 years and am currently playing it. On the fence about getting into classic. OP should let his friend decide on his own.
---
There's no reason to, this game isn't meant to be the hardest thing in the world and if you aren't clearing those raids with your guild yourself then just leave and let live.
---
2019, technology has opened up so many doors for this type of thing
---
now duel her until she has 1% health left
---
I never thought anything about him, because I don't give a crap about streamers.
---
you dont get banned for character names though you just get a forced name change, not to mention you're unable to use 'dick' in your name..?
---
Jesus Christ. Why do you guys care so much what he does? It’s just pathetic how much you guys obsess over him and put everything he does under a microscope.
---
It maybe got no-lifers to 60 1 day earlier than if they had just 5 man dungeoned.
---
Its not a massive advantage.
---
They should release new harder 20 man raids
---
Yeah already have first aid, was just neglecting cooking and fishing. Think I might tonight
---
That's not what he said. 
---
You're wrong and you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Always mark a priority target - and more impartant - tell the DDs about it. People are just used to the idea that a tank automatically holds aggro of _everything_, but telling them it is different is generally accepted. Some people just have to be reminded.
---
That's a valid reason actually. Just seems the one they gave was pretty bad
---
And back when that merger happened people called me paranoid when I said WoW was gonna fucking die.  Less than 2 years later, RIP peak subscriber base.
---
People *still* say I'm nuts when I tell them WoW is dead.  Imagine being that delusional about ActiBlizz in 2019.
---
#nochanges
---
What people who already have content on farm can do is not a measure of the general population.
---
If you are rolling a mage on alliance, then you probably want to be a gnome.
---
Their passive is similar to undeads.
---
-cheers
---
Looks like some gnomes are raiding it
---
Group up and you won't have as much downtime
---
Send him to the top boys.
---
DM is Dire Maul. VC is deadmines. Dire Maul is an instance people will repeatedly farm in endgame, so it gets priority.
---
Thanks ! 
---
what is ZG ?
---
Good pasta.
---
I've been sitting on a shitty dining room chair for a year. No problems so far. Actually I would say it's improved my sitting posture a lot haha.
---
Nope, blizzard very clearly states that players are bound to the agreements they make in the game.
---
As long as you used ingame chat to agree on the trade, you have to abide the trade. Else blizzard will take the stuff away and ban you for a short period of time.
---
Metzen's head continued to grow and I thought he was what was going wrong. Then he stepped down and we see I was at least partially wrong.
---
still havent been able to find a working energywatch addon :/
---
Lol
---
Gave silver for godly referece at the end there. This post could do without the rest but that last paragraph makes me so happy
---
I mean also leveling in POE takes what like 8 hours once you know what you're doing?
---
Inb4 a commentary video where he will try to justify and fail and say OP is stupid for whatever reasons.
---
🍿
---
Fun!
---
Warriors are the best tanks but otherwise you can go Tauren Druid, just not as good tanking in raids but still really good for tanking while leveling and 5 mans at max level
---
Just FYI it was giving about 2x more exp than normal.
---
Mobs would give about 120 exp each (90 base plus 30 group bonus) when it should have been 60 exp (90 base minus 30 raid penalty)
---
So literally twice as much exp, kinda a big deal
---
I love my home.
---
Has WoW's class design gotten way better since I last played in WoD? People keep saying this, but classes are just don't feel great in retail. A lot of them seem like they lost identity and roles just kinda meld together, where one melee DPS feels just like playing another and etc.
---
Maybe it's because i come from playing classic RPGs like EQ and BG, but I just don't feel that having simple rotations and not constantly clicking buttons is a huge detriment.
---
Actually you don't even have to look at older games. Look at a game like dota. Four spells is plenty, and every hero feels different.
---
Classic isn't perfect, particularly with balance since there's certain specs that just aren't viable.
---
But you know ,even playing those shitty specs is worth it since they're fun and have a unique feel.
---
I think most of these people want to start raiding right away while saying that they will level alts normally. The best of both worlds.
---
Its subjective, if you can afford to sink 8 hours into something you *want* to then why not? 
---
Many people work for 8-12 hours a day, you could argue that they are over doing it... However they may be doing it to afford rent or an upcoming holiday, is that still overdoing it?
---
It's not for you to decide how the "Vanilla experience" should be like, he is after all an entertainer above all.

Hey guys, so I rolled a mage and am currently level 18. They are pretty dope and I hear they are really good at pvp
---
The thing is I used to have a really well geared lvl 70 rogue and Druid that I did a lot of pvp on. Stealth is amazing and I’m afraid that I am really going to miss it lol
---
Is mage pvp fun?
---
Fixed...
---
I'm so sorry for your loss. I played all week long with my little brother and I cant even imagine how you must feel. Remembers me to cherish each moment with him, in and out of game, even more.
---
Yet.
---
You could have just left it at that.
---
I was being facetious but this is actually an interesting point. Thanks!
---
I dont really foresee them adding new content.  Would diverge from TBC too much.  Would be much easier and cheaper for them to port TBC with probable higher returns than a classic content patch.
---
I'd venture to guess they will add TBC as a copy character option when it launches in addition to keeping regular servers.
---
There will definitely be a classic crowd that will want to stay classic when TBC launches.
---
Is he being a good boy?
---
End thread.
---
I farmed these for weeks in Vanilla. Made some nice gold with these little guys.
---
I'll take your child
---
Ignore the streamers, they're probably aoe grinding/layer grinding mobs. There's lots of fun to be had in PVE, read the quest and enjoy the ride.
---
Interesting. I can definitely see that being a problem. It takes a different skillset to do twitch. And twitch streaming an MMO sounds super hard to keep interesting
---
Well, I'm not that beginner because I've played a lot in future expansions (TBC/WOTLK/CATA), I'm interested in being effective tank for dungeons and raids.
---
As far as I've heard in vanilla oy warriors can tank effectively so I'm a bit curious about other classes downsides
---
Praying for a speedy recovery
---
#feelbetter
---
Ah shit. That sucks, but thanks for the forewarning. If anyone has experience with account sharing I'd love to hear. She doesn't make much, but she loved WoW as a kid. I make enough to get a subscription, but not two...
---
Seriously, it's disgusting, and there are tons of cheaters trying to downplay how OP it was.
---
Personally for me it feels like story of retail is just meant to be single player experience. You are the one only hero in those quest chains. It really doesn't feel good. I think it is much better design in MMO that you are just one of many.
---
Playing a warlock?
---
Upon thousands and thousands of people playing and enjoying Classic. This is what you focus on?
---
WHY?
---
Why does it matter what Asmongold does? This circlejerk is insane..
---
&gt; Is it viable? Sure. Is it optimal? No. If you're in a guild and they're familiar with you and your play style, it won't be an issue. But it's still suboptimal. Which means that warriors tanking will always be the optimal route, but it's certainly possible and viable to have a bear tank.
---
I'd argue it's higher than viable and bridging on optimal during progression. Afterwards, it gets very blurry and they are competing with each other.
---
I'm playing on Skullflame [EU] and never experienced full server or queues. It's high population from noon to late night, but never full. And looking at realm list only first two servers have problems with big amount of players for most of the time.
---
What a god
---
Every time i run WoW classic, i have to pick a server and my characters are sorted by the time i created it, i remember that it wasn't like this. You automatically login to the last server you were playing and character were sorted by recent use (or level) don't remember clearly. Am i wrong or something isn't working correctly?
---
I paid but still can't play. When I get off work there's queues. I rerolled to a server blizzard suggested to avoid queues, it still 2-3 hours every day.
---
I've played a bit on a newer server, thats actually not full on EU, and the amount of pure noobs I've seen is insane.
---
The likes who will run after me and kill the same mobs as me after I tag them, meaning that they get no xp, but then also just ignore the group invite. A lvl 15 warrior farming boars outside of OG with a white 1h axe and no shield, a priest who did not have a wand at lvl 25, the list goes on and on.
---
Its quite charming, I have to say I did not really expect the pure noobs to play and enjoy classic none the less.
---
Please do, I almost asked him to start with me this past week. Now I won’t ever get that chance, make your time count because nothing past the present is a guarantee.
---
Did you even try to spend your time more productive then complain about someone's way to play video game?🤣 And also Asmon doesn't represent all WOW community
---
Good riddance.

---
I leveled an orc through Durotar, and after that played with a friend in Durotar. He has questie installed and showed me 3 or 4 quests I just forgot about, but instantly remembered when he told me.
---
I really don't want to use questie, because I don't want it to tell me where to go and what to do for a quest (the questlog tells me almost everything I need to know), but missing quests kinda sucks.
---
I'm with you. Being a shadowy fucking ninja is the best way to play rogue, and I don't even care if it's sub-optimal.
---
Damn, my bad. I guess I put too much effort into the editing. Should’ve just left it as is.
---
This is satire and everyone in the comments just got trolled.
---
video is sped up to start with.
---
and they get &lt;20k XP over that video.
---
so I don't know where you pulled 100k from
---
There are tons of videos on YouTube about this kind of stuff.
---
If you go warrior or rogue. The weapon is the most important item. You want something that has a high top end and bottom end, these are slower weapons. Then your instant attack’s do more damage. If your a warrior you stick to 2h weapons.  Get sharpening stones and keep healing potions and food that gets you well fed. Also minor strength pots are very cheap. Ask for buffs, mark of the wild from druids is the best imo.
---
Depends on the server, Northdale allowed it
---
I am enjoying Rogue so far (level 12) but the only thing I am worried about is the whole crafting poisons and having to use some reagents for abilities. Is this tedious? I don't wanna constantly be worrying about it, so I've been looking into other classes.
---
Updated main post with solution.
---
I'm level 14 currently and looking forward to do the quest.
---
Were you able to solo it? Haven't played any PServer stuff so only can recall from memory but the waves were so difficult and the NPC that you had to protect always ran into mobs.
---
I'm currently specced for aoe mage leveling. I'm finding some of the aoe grinding spots to be busy, should I just respec to the single target spec? I'm level 24 and already have filled out the talents for permafrost and improved blizzard. Also think I will have more fun just questing with the single target build
---
Ive done this but I still get the out of range spam :/
---
Mage and priest were always great partners in vanilla.
---
Deviate Delight. It’s an RPPVP server, but there hasn’t been ONE queue time to log in, and there’s already been plenty of world pvp by people leveling.
---
That quote is actually a tip that the WoW devs coded into retail during loading screens.
---
The only thing I’d like to say is that a bunch of the Classic WoW addons that people use are things that Blizzard incorporated into retail as standard features AFTER people had already been using them in vanilla.
---
I don’t agree with people using Questie though.  I have been having a blast figuring out where stuff is.
---
If this is true I have a reason to play classic, otherwise I'm going back to retail.
---
I got to 20 in classic and due to the high pop, high queue, general hustle and bustle in the most normally deserted quest zones I will probably go back to retail.
---
I'm British and I should love queues but frankly I do not.
---
The game has been ruined in a week's time because some people that are extremely knowledgeable on it have already hit max level? How did that affect anyone?

Private server. The people that practiced this shit for years.
---
I straight up didn't train anything for the last 15 levels ahaha
---
The cursor makes it obvious and not even a slow drag?
---
Like i said, its a left over from when questing wasnt how you got to cap, grinding mobs were. So most quests in classic are just thinly veiled grinding that gives you rewards. Yeah, it sucks not getting the drop, but you're getting exp, money and possible drops while doing it. Bascially,  the idea was that the quests were just an extra bonus while killing mobs you'd be killing to level anyway. 
---
Yeah, being in a group and doing collect quests suck, but you kill them faster so there's more chances to loot. I did redridge goulash with my wife for like an hour, and we had to go to bed. The next to i tried to finish it alone and it took damn near 3 hours to do it solo. Anyways, i wont say that BC and WotLK quest style doesn't feel better, because it definitely does. However, classic style wasnt a bad design choice, it was just an extension of leveling in mmos of that era, and was significantly better at that. Knowing that doesn't help when you've killed 50 kobolds for their ears when you only need 12, but it does help to keep in mind that you're still advancing as a character while you do it.
---
Classic is 40
---
Why does it matter? The way i see it is they all want to be world first to do so and so.. besides they will most likely go back and level another character the normal way for the experience. I highly doubt all streamers only play 1 character
---
they would be the first anyways
---
Eh, some used it sure but they mostly used 5 mans. I personally think dungeon exp is like 25% better than it should be.
---
I don't know how old you are, but I'm in my mid thirties and I watch streamers.
---
Not wow though, fuck that.
---
19 minute video on mage races. What. The. Fuck.
---
Chu mean? The guy that got the biggest clip of world first rag classic streamed the whole leveling. he 5 manned sm from like 30 to 43 then did zf from like 43 to 53. they had a more then 5 at some point in there though (excluding the char they use to reset instance and get teleported to entrance)

" I love watching people beg, it's entertaining. "  
---
"My job is begging and appealing to the lowest common demoninator."
---
But did they hunter/lockpull for a key... im more interested if thats possible in classic
---
I disagree.
---
In Retail you have to trailblaze so you can join a group each new "Tier".
---
For example, if you raided Uldir at heroic, your equipment will be completely obsolete with Battle for Dazararlor. As such you have to farm once again and you will have a hard time with getting into mythic +.
---
On the other hand, in classic, you have your molten core equipment, you can go into zul'gurub and black wing lair, no differences because of difficulty setting and items are viable for a long time. Many molten core items will be used until Naxxramas.
---
As such, you have to farm much less in molten core and you got much less randomness. You can easier catch up and items are viable for a longer time.
---
As such, more casual friendly because "catching up" is much easier.
---
One time i wanted to ban a kid, who was superduper annoying, instead i got banned, so.. Yeah, you can :D
---
That’s his form of humor. Maybe the issue is that you can’t tell when he isn’t being serious.
---
I share a similar form of humor. You say stupid obviously contentious or absurd things in deadpan or with a seriousness that makes the who statement humorously bizarre. Its called absurdist comedy. The fact people get baited is what makes it even more hilarious.
---
I’ve watched him for a while now, and he’s only serious like 10% of the time. It’s actually concerning just how many people who hate him take him so seriously.
---
Yes. I honestly only put a sunder or two on every mob cause they die too fast to get five on. Bosses are the only thing I sunder five times.
---
Congrats man! Well done

Even if people didn’t watch streamers, Silk market would be like that since people are leveling and its not like silk is an extremely rare material. This happens all the time when a large amount of people are leveling. They want the mats out of their inventory and will auction them. When people start leaving the level bracket where silk drops a lot, the market will stabilize. 
---
Of course if a large group of people do something, others will gradually follow. It’s a thing that happens commonly in real life. The guys who do it find it fun for themselves to do so. Sure it’s not a single player game, but it’s a GAME. You want to enjoy it while it lasts. It’s not like the guys instance leveling are coming and ruining your fun in the game. If anything, it’s keeping them away from you so you can farm and quest the way you want in the open world if you like doing that stuff.
---
What even is this layer thing? I see people asking for layer changes but why?
---
monkeynews streamed everything
---
I mean I’m glad I can use DM like I wanted to now, but it was pretty much exclusively called VC (at least on my server) back in 2005.
---
They did that in TBC.
---
Because it's a race and it's not just any race. It's the kind of race where no trying is allowed. Also no grinding of any kind is allowed to race fair you need to do quests and you have to enjoy the game, but while you enjoy the game you need to adhere to the unwritten rules of fairness.
---
I like Asmongold, I tune into his streams daily and enjoy them. But you'd be fooling yourself if you think his stream being entertaining is less important than anything else. He even said it himself the other day. All he cares about is putting on a good show and retaining his viewers. That's his *job*, his way of sustaining himself and his family.
---
He may love WoW and WoW classic in general, but that's not as important as the streaming itself. No one wanted to see him do boring shit and level super slow the normal way, especially for a warrior. Also he could afford anything in-game since 100k+ people are willing to give gold to him. Big whoop.
---
N o s t a l g I a
---
It's not my idea of fun but for some people it's always about speed and levelling as efficiently as possible.
---
If it can make you feel better I reached 60 two hours ago and it didn't prevent me from getting stuck in the tunnel from Felwood to Winterspring.
---
Of course, people were doing dungeon farming with 5 people before the meta changed to 6+. It's just a bit slower/less efficient.
---
Oh, cool. I'll look at YouTube then. I'm thinking of doing a dwarf paladin myself but this is good advice for a future troll warrior :)
---
As a healer I got two shamans on speed dial that I'll whisper every time I'm lacking a tank. Both of them have tanked multiple dungeons for me with great success. Rockbiter and Earthshock and they aren't losing threat to anyone.
---
He puts his viewcount over his own classic-experience, how can this be surprising to you ?
---
Look, there are a shitton of people around the classic-streamer/youtuber community that don't have a fucking clue what classic is about but swim with the stream for gains and profits.
---
I'm by no means a fan of Asmon or his sidekick and they're realitystrweam show, but i know they're a show and as a show they have to entertain. 
---
How the fuqq haven't you realized that 90% of his actions and reactions on stream are for entertainment purposes only, he's an act like the Kardashians, anything for controversy and viewcount cause that's how you "make it" in this trumptarded world.
---
Fake or real,  the Pleb doesn't give a fuck as long as they get a laugh out of it.....
---
If you went into Classic expecting entertainers like Asmon would play the game on Your terms, the only person you should be disappointed of is yourself.
---
You're the disappointment.
---
Imagine being so invested in a streamer. Jesus Christ.
---
During one of the Blizzard interviews, I can't remember who, they said once they started classic, there was no going back. Classic will be supported and running for as long as retail. One won't go down without the other. It makes it easier for Blizzard to support both since it's all one sub.
---
They want Classic, but they also wanna be #1.
---
It's just a persona bro
---
So will the other 'serious' raid guilds.
---
Why would you advise this? Don't be an asshole and intentionally try to get people to quit.
---
I think like a frost mage soooo frost nova, turn, distance, blizzard.
---
The majority of people Iv played with on classic so far quit after cata
---
The damage is done.  Now, if you aren't a mage/warlock or a warrior you are trash. 
---
I mean it was always sort of true, but a lot more people know it this time lmao.
---
Smart, very much so.
---
How you gonna have every addon except onebag lol
---
I hated dailies even in BC.  Same repetitive content every day...  Zzz
---
Idk who you're talking about but he seems to be on a very low level, socially mentally and spiritually.
---
+1 for Clique. I just use the default raid frames with left click being my main heal, right click being my HoT, ctrl modifier for buffs etc. Works really well.
---
NO NO NO NO FUCK OFF RETAIL PLAYERS FUCK OFFFF
---
lmao you upset or something autismo ? its exactly the way he put it that made it sound like he was okay with it. fuck off with your white knight shit he can defend himself son
---
Farmed it for like an hour on retail like a year ago on a dead server and only got like 3. That shit is dummy rare
---
I dunno why people even watch this guy, He's so fucking annoying.
---
start with curse of agony and corruption, dont hit it with immolation and shadowbolt right away, let WV get aggro
---
How has this post gotten so many awards?
---
It's a twink weapon. For level 19 twinks. Not level 60 players.
---
What are that numbers near nameplate?
---
But people don't usually run 10 man LBRS.
---
I feel like I’m playing quite a lot considering my availability (20h a week at least), and I’m still only level 18. This is gonna take a while and I’m glad to not be in a rush. Also playing without addons so I actually am reading the quest descriptions for once.
---
That’s so good
---
just curious, can't purge remove priest shield?
---
Speaking as a programmer, they were able to update this without restarting the servers? Nice!
---
Is this loremaster?

---
could someone explain what phase 2 entails properly please?
---
I've been reading about Clique on this sub. Does it basically just replace the need for using a macro? Same end result?
---
That is absolutely why I'm here. Classes mattered, choices mattered, nothing felt like it was handed to you, and the world felt bigger.
---
I used to leave the curse client running and it would happily update things by itself. The twitch app still has that check for updates timer setting, but it doesn't work. On top of that, it's slow and choppy, taking almost an entire minute to update add-ons.
---
more like 20k
---
i was about to post this video, the best u can have on classes
---
I never said he was being serious, genius. Insinuate I'm stupid more, please.
---
I said he is purposely baiting attention. Which he does, like every streamer. Because it's in his best interest to. I'm not saying anything controversial there
---
Not sure how you'd hit a level 30, wouldn't the miss rate be huge?
---
The highest xp/hr i've seen was Tribe from APES who had close to 100k in ZF. I have never seen anyone with 150k.
---
I surprised that battlenet doesn't verify that and allow to launch a game with swapped game content.
---
I finally reached Ashenvale yesterday and typed in the chat that it was my favorite location in wow. Immediately was accused of shit taste. What would that guy say to this, huh?
---
This is like the promo skin from hots for overwatch, the hearthsteed, and the primal flamesaber.
---
Really smart and also cool for people that like everything like me
---
You can 10 man any dungeon except a select few high level dungeons like brd, strat, and scholo. The reason is that originally everything allowed 10 players, but when blizzard added the tier .5 quest line which involved high level dungeons they chose to restrict the involved dungeons to 5 players.
---
yikes
---
Yeah it’s really a shame. You only get one chance to relive the experience and he’s doing it all wrong. Classic is about watching your character grow every step of the way. Free gold and power level runs is such a shitty way to show case the game. Such a disappointment not even madz
---
What's your /played?
---
Mythic Dungeons are the best thing they’ve added to the game since Arena imo. I stopped playing shortly into mists and tried the game again with a few months left in legion. A lot of the systems I didn’t like, but Mythic+ really forces the group to use their classes to the full extent and feels a lot tighter since it’s far less people than raiding. Definitely check it out if you check out retail
---
The true classic experience is the non existence of streamers.
---
That's easily 1000g-2000g each in phase 2.
---
I second this question
---
"/who 25-50" showed 2 players all evening
---
This is no changes, they fixed a bug...
---
who said it bothered me? My claim is simple: streamers who claim they'll later do something off stream and under a unverifiable name are simply liars making excuses to overcome their obvious hypocrisy.
---
no idea :)) a lot, 3+ days
---
No, what they were doing was essentially an exploit. They just nerfed it. Stick to questing.
---
StReaMerS BaD :pepega:
---
Pretty much. It lets you configure what actions to take when clicking default frames, like raid frames, party frames, regular target frame. It’s pretty customizable. And super lightweight
---
Oh hey, this is one of the servers I was considering.  Any comments on alliance vs horde population?
---
Uhm if I remember correctly, it's called "Chatter"
---
You should download CensusPlusClassic to see the numbers.
---
I use Luna Unit Frames, the reason for me was that I am new to the Healer Business (was Main Tank for decades). Luna Unit Frames visualize how much heal the target receive with this it’s easier for me to handle my new role.
---
And my axe
---
Nah, I use an addon to autotag fascists. I don't look through the post history myself.
---
Also please don't misunderstand me on purpose. Your reason for ganking lowbies is to make other people miserable, not just to have fun yourself. I gank people to have fun, if they get angry or sad it's really not my intention to do so. Your intention to do the same thing that I do (except I don't gank lowbies but whatever) is extremely different than my intention. Your is malicious, mine is to have fun.
---
English does, gotta call a spade a spade
---
Also looked super boring!

Nerzhul didn't challenge Sargeras. Nerzhul betrayed Sargeras, then got caught after his plan failed and got torn to pieces and made into the Lich King. He wasn't even first in line for warchief only inheriting it AFTER backhand AND Doomhammer were both defeated. Nerzhul does not magically make Arthas a god teir combatant (btw cannon lore is Nerzhul ceased to exist when Arthas put on the crown). 
---
Arthas is a great warrior and has the power to control a seemingly unlimited army of the damned. But he's never shown in the lore to be capable of defeating massive creatures in single combat with Frostmourne. He's killed tons of dragons and such, but he always has his undead army with him. He's a cool, badass villain but he's not on the same tier as old gods, elemental lords, or dragon aspects.
---
I was trying to keep up with professions but it radically slowed my leveling. Aside from the distraction, I had permanently full bags.  
---
The only thing I am keeping up with now is first aid because that actually speeds up leveling. Everything else can wait until i have bigger bags and a mount.

I may take a look thanks very much
---
You actually do have everything except the latest expansion. How WoW works these days is that a sub gives you access to anything in the game until the latest expansion. You don’t have to buy WoW anymore. You just make an account and sub and have everything until level 110 unlocked
---
I guess the difference there being our usage habits then. I open it on occasion when I want an addon or to update the ones I have. It works perfectly fine for that, and I've never experienced it taking any longer than about 10 seconds
---
It's not a change, it's a bug fix..
---
Lol. They had more than 5 in ZF and LBRS they turned off streams so nobody learnt anything.
---
I have my own route developed as a result of my experiences. Not following any route at all, I just have level ranges where I go to a zone or do dungeon.
---
I made 20g selling mats I farmed over 1 level.  Skinning mining is profitable yo.
---
The elitist mentality is in full force.
---
I did RFC at lvl 19 with two irls (All three of us were lvl 19, we just want to clear all dungeons for the heck of it) and also tagged a lvl 13 friend a long. The tank we invited, lvl 17 warrior left after he got invited cause he "did not want to boost a lvl 13".
---
RFC is very hard after all. /s
---
Sorry, didn't see this until now. But I actually do not know.
---
For those who are a little lost: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident
---
It’s amazing what happens when you’re forced to slow down. I think my ideal WoW would still have some other QOL enhancements, but I’d take this over retail any day.
---
Or maybe they don't want the second character to be known because it'll ruin their questing experience. And so what if they lie about making a second character, how does that even affect you in the slightest?
---
Tanking is tough at low levels - when you don't have your full tool kit.  And RFC at level 13 or so is an extreme example of this!
---
The flip side is that RFC is easy! Just take it easy - ranged pull mobs one at a time where possible - and you should be okay.
---
The bit I struggle with (as a feral tank) is not having a ranged taunt.  If you lose aggro on something, you have to chase it down.
---
Maybe I should level fishing just so I have a way to relax.

He stuck with wow for years when the popular streamers had quit. If I remember correctly he was a bit of a nerd and a loser even by wow standards, but he was able to amass a following simply by staying dedicated to the game and just not quitting. I could be wrong though.

Agreed. 1.5 sec speed, with tons of dmg.

Aim for Dead Mines probably. Lots of good rogue gear.
---
Id like pet battles, transmog and new graphics, I'd be super content with that.
---
How long would you say the poisons last? Sorry to ask specifics.
---
Wait what. I’m completely new to wow. I thought fishing, cooking and first aid were professions, can I level those alongside my skinning and leatherworking?
---
That's probably splitting the community too much, I would actually be all for content at the end of current classics life, if they do something like OSRS has been doing.
---
Why. Rattlegore is such a good server. High pop during peek with no queue
---
I prefer on land swimming, I learned from chuck norris.
---
Are you using distract?
---
Don't play Wow but op seems like a disappointed fan boy. Cringy
---
For real, who thought, or thinks highly of asmongold?
---
Not really, they were 10 man at launch.
---
Works fine, have fun.
---
Playing rogue too and it's hard lol, so jealous of the mages and warlocks I see that are just dunking everything
---
I will never understand why people follow streamers honestly. Play the game yourself and enjoy it...stop wasting time watching others play unless it's to learn strategies or something.
---
Because its literally psychology. The satisfaction of working towards something and accomplishing that is considered hard amongst your fellow peers and hobbyist.
---
You get the exact same feeling out of anything that is consider hard or time consuming,  college education,  a TV, or a new car. People who dont share that passion dont give a shit but those who do get it.
---
Humans are wired for this rush of dopamine that we receive when we accomplish something, so making something artificially hard in a game keeps people working on it an trying otherwise there is Zero incentive to complete the task.
---
dude he's just a streamer. move on and attach yourself to something else.
---
On a different server but hit 17 and go to Dead Mines in westfall for your first dungeon
---
I know that he did Hakkar on his Pally, but i don't know about other bosses
---
Levelling 30-40 in SM is pretty much the Classic experience. The quest zone options aren't particularly riveting unless you like grinding centaur in Desolace or getting ganked in STV.
---
fucking cringe as hell
---
Remember the DKP video?   Remember when he says "Ok, you're going to dps slowly"?  That's why.
---
I tried a couple classes and couldn't settle on what I liked. Found that video myself randomly and decided to play warlock. Haven't looked back. Also his fishing stream earlier today was just soo relaxing.
---
I have to take the good with the bad, sadly. Almost a necessary evil to keep playing classic for free.
---
Yup exactly this. Asmon is actually so chill, but people take him waaay to serious
---
DM was one of the first dungeons, and no other dungeon is referred to by a boss name. DM is deadmines whether you accept it or not. Dire maul is referred to by wing and has been for a long time
---
I thought this was satire at first lol
---
 Thanks for taking the time to type this out.
---
Oh, just shut the fuck up! If you don't like him, don't watch his stream... AgendaAndy
---
Who cares how someone plays a game? If fanboys want to give him money then let them.. that doesn't affect you. You aren't the one giving your money away.
---
I get what you are trying to say.. but.. you do you man.. who cares what influencers/streamers do.
---
Be careful backtracking so much that you don't trip.
---
An item like Shadoweave Robe says it " Increases damage done by Shadow spells and effects by up to 21. "  What does that mean?  Is the bonus damage random between 0-21?  
---
Compare to an item that just says "+21 Shadow spell damage".
---
They're wrong. The only thing that changed was that you could do dungeons with 6+ people, Blizzard nerfed this but you're still perfectly able to cleave down dungeons in a 5 man group.
---
[Here's the official plan](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346).
---
The first dungeon I ran in Classic was WC and I was a bit concerned because we had someone slightly underleveled tanking but as long as you control your pulls and play togethor then they're not actually that big a problem (this warrior tank even used a 2h).
---
Haha, I'm doing the same thing! I didn't really focus too much on professions in Vanilla. I had herb and alch to 300 but didn't have any special recipes. I didn't have cooking or fishing at all. Pretty sure I had first aid but didn't really use it much since I was a shaman healer.
---
This time around I'm level 25 and have 225 cooking and fishing, I've been using bandages like crazy even though I'm a druid and could just heal instead. They are so handy. I pop a rejuv and a bandage and my health shoots up super fast with hardly any mana spent.
---
I'm especially proud of my fishing cause man it took a long time to hit 225 and it'll take even longer to hit 300 lol. I had no idea how easy it was to level cooking though when you're doing fishing with it.
---
I picked up skinning and leatherworking to try them out and try to level it with my character. it's something I've always wanted to do. I am honestly kind of disappointed with it though. I'll likely change it to herb/alch at some point.
---
Well, APES has been practicing for a few years so they get a little break when it comes to group comp, gear, and apparently level. We'll see how the first untrained group does, lol.
---
Woof woof hoe
---
The thing is he always has fans and enemies hanging around him. So him getting ganked by 5 people is on average offset by him having 5 extra followers. So in truth, his experience is not that much different from a normal persons in terms of frequency of world pvp.
---
Cringeworthy, but the man speaks the truth. I seriously was let down when he broke that promise and just reverted to the same neckbeard status that he calls out from retail. I was super excited to watch him play and make it through the trials that a PvP server brings, but nope. He took the easy way just so he couldnt show weakness and push through to victory. Sad times indeed.
---
That’s how FF14 does it. The game starts out with you as an adventurer, then you figure out that you are more than that and after beating multiple bosses that lore-wise only you can fight, you are now seen as a hero by your folks and in the newest expansion you are now in a new place where nobody knows you and you want to stay low profile for reasons but the whole story is about YOU doing shit and saving the world.
---
Or uh, for testing rotations for mana efficiency and damage differences. E.g. frostbolt, fireball, arcane missiles - dots, cast times, mana costs.
---
Why do you think so many people were running 10 man sm runs. Streamers are influencers. The people influenced play wow.
---
Not if you’re struggling lo literally find quests you can doo without dying over and over again
---
Seriously, why do people even watch this clown?
---
Before they were boomkin, they were oomkin
---
I heard it's decent money as well. Nothing major but still some decent pocket change.
---
my breakdown is the server cap is probably around 12-15k and thats how many will be able to be logged in at once without layers.
---
This is why mage ignite is not allowed, takes a spot.
---
nice try McConnell
---
I gotchu, I gotchu
---
Even though it's a bug and I'm OK with it being nerfed, last Saturday I had A BLAST with my new guild with 10 horde trying to get to deadmines doing pvp and suffering to do the instance and slowly becoming more aware of how I could heal them and so. It felt like a mini-raid and I get ot know them better.
---
And by skill you mean gear ^_^
---
wonderful map.  thank you
---
I don't get what's wrong by spamming SM runs?
---
Basically what is was, when being in a group of 6 or more people you're supposed to receive a XP nerf but in classic they were recieving 14% more XP than playing solo which made AOE farming with a lot of people really quick leveling. 
---
They fixed it today to reduce the XP when in a raid group like it should be, but you can still do 5 man aoe parties.
---
Someone send this man some bags
---
I'm horde anyway, if the ally on your server wants to name it DM be my guest. It's just not the name people used to use and there isn't a good reason to change it.
---
I've played every free minute I've had since it came out and I'm level 15 lol. The demographic for WoW Classic is for sure going to take a while to hit max level.
---
What does the /cleartarget [dead][help] do?
---
Or even going to the class trainer. One might think it's tedious but to me this makes it feel like an RPG. I get more experience and more levels and need to visit a trainer to train better skills. I thought this part is something I actually never wanted back, but now that it's in classic I notice how much I've been missing it. The whole sense of progression by leveling up feels so much more rewarding.
---
Are you NA or EU?
---
As for EU:
---
Shazzrah is mainly spanish/scandinavia, AFAIK
---
Mograine, although full, is more ENG
---
Not sure about mograine, think it was the same as shazzrah
---
I can see that, haven't tried selling anything just been stockpiling it Haha
---
Welcome! Fishing, cooking and first aid are all secondary professions. You can level all 3 alongside your choice of 2 primary professions.
---
I do that very often.
---
I think I’d increase walking speed and give out some better gear would be it for me. Everything would have to scale up to adjust and keep the difficulty the same, though. I don’t want the game to be easier or anything, just want to some cool stuff to loot from quests and stuff around the map.
---
The tank has plenty of other groups to join, the thing happened back in the old days.

---
If it works, people are going to do it. you can't put 15 years of cultural MMO experience back into pandora's box and expect people to be fresh-faced, naive, and full of wonder anymore when it comes to stuff like grinding.
---
The game came out less than a week ago, I think we can cut them some slack on their timeliness here.
---
Blizz won't ban him. This is why server wide shitlists are a thing.
---
i did sartharion 3d before ulduar came out, and got starcaller before the stupid jousting tournament came out. and every piece of agility leather had some combination of agility, stamina, hit, crit and attack power. got to the point you didn't care anymore, you just equip the highest iLvL piece because your gearscore is what gets you into groups.
---
Unless they've moved to another layer for some reason, I think they should. They did state in the AMA that you will be in thr same layer as your guild iirc.
---
If you honestly think levelling in classic to 60 is quicker than levelling 2+ chars in bfa to 110 I doubt you’ve been playing a lot of either game
---
I get that but my points still stand because who can pay that at the moment
---
You got shoulder  as well.. NICE!! those things are hard to come by, even as white item!
---
The grundy design of classic is not about the friends along the way it's about how long blizzard could keep you subscribed for. HTH.
---
Started at 9000, but the estimate is always way off at any queue position
---
I’ve macroed Hunters mark and pet attack together:
---
/use Hunters Mark
---
/petattack
---
Stop trying to control people dude. he has never taken an oath to be the "representative for classic" 
---
he just does what he wants, and you yourself choose to watch him. its like going swimming then be mad because you got wet.
---
Yeah but these were designed for exploration before the time of YouTube and guides.  Getting lost was part of the fun.
---
The mystery of wow can only be explored once reexploring the past would only bring up modern day exploitation.
---
Absolutely love it!
---
I mean, my actual vanilla experience also involved looking up leveling guides, finding out what the best items available to me while questing were, guides to powerlevel professions, guides to farming gold for my mount, etc. 
---
The game has always been like this, and there will always be tons of players looking to min/max everything.
---
I'm sorry for your loss. Videogames and their community can be a great escape, but please make sure to spend a lot of time with your family too.
---
Yeah but if they dont bring people with them, then they're getting corpse camped by 40 streamsnipers

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cylogw/to_all_druids_restrain_from_using_your/). 
---
&gt;There literally statistically is. 
---
  Well that's your problem right there. You want to analyze flip charts and crunch numbers and you have fun doing that, go right ahead. I'm going to enjoy the game my way.
---
&gt;Please try to argue that a group with 3 rogues will be, on average, as fast as a group with 3 mages.
---
  I'm not going to because that argument is unrealistic and doesn't approach what I'm talking about.
---
 I'm talking about people who ONLY want priest heals, ONLY want a prot warrior tank or an extremely specific builds and class combinations that will at best shave single minutes off a run.  That shit can stay in retail. It has no place here.
---
  It's like being served a nice meal at a restaurant and inhaling it in 5 min without even taking the time to enjoy it.  Like why bother?   You should have just heated up some hot pockets if all you wanted to do was fill your belly.
---
People complaining about streamers instead of playing themselves are even bigger losers, sry op
---
Nice thanks for the info

---
The thing is in vanilla, you're part of an army that downed these bosses. In retail it's like you did it solo.
---
It wasn't because the old macro system was broken. They just removed some functionality.
---
What people who watch him and then hear him off stream in another persons discord can see is that (as many others) he is putting on an on-stream character, which I assume brings him a really nice income.
---
What was clear from the beginning is that this character is not going to fly with all that is nice about classic and vanilla and I assumed he would tone it down for classic, because he seemed to be looking forward to it. He didnt and I guess that is fine, if he doesnt look back and regret this whole week.
---
I was surprised about many of the die hard classic "voices" ending up "selling" their launch experience to the Method event, which again is probably nice income, but did not seem in any way fitting to how they came across with looking forward to this. Most do seem annoyed and bored with 24/7 dungeon spamming and I hope everyone who chose that road will still have some time to enjoy it after the launch hype is done with.
---
On my mage, I throw an intellect out as well as food for warriors. I tend to give water and food out regardless but I go out of my way to give warriors a 20-stack of conjured food. Anything that helps them save money.
---
Don't know who this guy is but they sound like trash.
---
The Rake got nerfed tho didn't he? I mean in the classic we play he is already nerfed right?
---
You just called him the same name he called you.
---
Huh - i remember those dungeons on My server back in the days, was only done as 10mans? Didnt know they limited it to 5..
---
Don't look now

It took that long for the Robes of Arugal to drop for me, xD.   
---
I don't mind them patching this exploit, never abused. Don't know the kind of people who would. I would like it if the abusers got a temporary ban (like 2\~4 days). Just for us to catch up a bit. They shouldn't get to enjoy the benefits of being high leveled first (farming, professions, building guild prestige, etc), if they skipped the actual leveling process. It starts the game off on a bad foot and gives cheaters a massive advantage. Strange that this went unnoticed. I do remember streamers talking about this before actual launch. At least it was caught quickly.
---
And a reminder for Shamans: Rockbiter Weapon generates extra threat, so don't use that in instances.
---
&gt; You only get one chance to relive the experience and he’s doing it all wrong.
---
So how does that affect you ? You're free to relive the experience however you want.
---
I don't even watch asmond, hate his stream actually he talks way to much.
---
On retail I use an addon called Gnome Sequencer. It lets you bind abilities on GCD together and iterates over them. I'm playing a 1 button hunter for my regular rotation that way.
---
How very astute of you... 🙄
---
I think the difference is in the cinema you have a very large screen and your field of vision is 90% of this screen. When it comes to PC monitor it is not even close to that unless you use TV as your monitor. Also, you sit father away in the cinema so all this light loses some portion of its power and is less straining for your eyes overall. 
---
Also, the longest movies are 3 hours long, dont tell me you play wow for less than that. 
---
It also might be because the movie in the cinema is projected and not emitted.
---
BINGO! 
---
I'm watching Madseasonshow fishing up his 300. 
---
He's just fishing, but he's talking to the chat, and it's fantastic. 
---
:D
---
Fun fact at low levels you can demolish mobs with a fishing pole because it goes off of your Fishing Skill rather than your weapon skill
---
As a lock player, I generally don’t expect heals unless I am being attacked. A lock should not be aggressively life tapping like that in a dungeon unless they’re able to do it without being a burden on the healer.
---
Why would anyone care what the hell is wrong with people. Holy fucking shit. 99,9% of people here would accept my trade if I tried to give you 500 gold.
---
The fact this winds you up is well just pathetic really. Let him do him and you do you. Raids are getting cleared and classic will be dead soon. All you classic elitists will be back on retail. As some one who played towards the end of vanilla, I'd love to know how many of these die hard classic fans were actually there then and not jumping on the bandwagon now. It's a game ffs
---
yea, i'm sure those 75k concurrent on average would agree with you.
---
It's a very long winded wannabe intelligent rant that concludes in this sub's main agenda of streamer man bad
---
Which option is it even?
---
Saving for later
---
Look at his Profile. It's the sad story of Mr. Important Opinion not getting the attention he wants :(
---
Oh and he.is a toxic assfuck
---
Mad about people not playing the game you want to play the game. You are uber lame bro. Gonna give hate to bald mage cus he aoegrinded for lvls instead of rping in goldshire? This a classic gay reddit post.
---
Did people not beg for mount, gear, or just gold back in classic? They sure did. 95% of people on this subreddit is gay boyz who hate that everyone isnt rping and reading every quest they do because thats apparently the only way to experience classic
---
bro 😎💪
---
hi baldy
---
I joined Flame Skull never had a que and it's always on high for players, honestly it's the perfect balance as far as I am concerned.
---
I have a girlfriend now and an apartment. Wish I had more time to play :P
---
Only ever watched two asmongold videos, simply out of curiosity... I can tell you he is absolutely not the kind of person we want in the classic community.
---
No, because the streamers hang out with their same gang all the time.
---
Let’s talk in 2 months when guilds are breaking up left and right because MC is proven to be “easy mode” but people can’t cut it. The average player isn’t cut out to raid, at all, and it is going to show when they step out from LFR into something where some level of competence is required from a decent portion of the bodies. Anyone that said guilds that have been practicing MC for years would still need a long time to prep is very misguided, but the general population is a different beast.
---
I maintain that while the good players will be a lot better in classic than they were in vanilla, the median will be pretty close to the same as it was. Top guilds will clear everything that can be cleared in the first week unless there is a hard gear check (and I’m no expert on where/if that will exist) and in a year’s time the average Joe will be lucky to be thinking about BWL
---
You can PM me for help. We’re an active expat group with a wechat group and guild on Arugal.
---
You had me until the second paragraph.
---
I have not once experienced a group where this didn’t happen. Everyone is so cool with sticking around. We even reset stockades so that a couple of us could get their bandanas. 
---
I can’t believe my friend list has grown in one week than in one year or BfA.
---
Imagine thinking somebody like me plays a shit title like that. 
---

---
Im thinking what i will roll as 2nd class and with hunter i tought. " i have trobles with bag space now, and hunter have -1 bag coz of arrows/ammo. "
---
Every hunter is different.
---
For me my milestone was finding the pet that I knew was "the one."
---
I levelled up bouncing around between pets, never found one I really liked. Ran with a crocolisk for awhile because they were cool.
---
Then ran Razerfen and found it. The battle boar.
---
Not only did it eat everything, which was great for middle school me who didn't plan ahead. Not only did it have charge so it worked for my awful survival hunter melee build (which actually worked well in BG. Apparently when you do no damage and can't stop flag carriers people don't focus on killing you so you seem hard to kill.)
---
But the fucker has ARMORED PLATING. Only cool people get to have armor, so a pet with armor? That's like triple cool.
---
This time around I'll have to pick an actually good pet, but my milestone will be grabbing another battle boar to keep in my stable.
---
If you "pretend to be a douchebag" and do douchebag things, you *are* still a douchebag.
---
Well my story looks exactly the same and I got much fun in Classic after 30 levels
---
And please stop running in front of me and pulling mobs, you're not helping and making the dung way more stressful than it needs to be.
---
Elune be with you
---
Many of them are though. Most of these let's play/streamer types main demographic is the 13-18 age segment, at least based on a lot of the YT data I have seen. I imagine it's not much different for Twitch
---
I currently have a wild boar lvl 10, thinking he might do the job as a pet tank. Is growl self learned? Haven't seen anything like that in my spell book.
---
He's funny and not afraid to speak his mind, which is why I like watching him. But people have different tastes.
---
3-4 Warrs + R Sham is still among the fastest ways to level in the 30s.
---
3-4 Casters + Heal (+Tank maybe) will be almost as fast.
---
So, yes.
---
Level 23 Just moved to ashenvale, game super fun lieveling taking a while but I love it rushing is boring
---
Almost 39. Had last week off, and me and 2 other friends spent 7 days in a LAN.
---
Welcome in 2019, Its not BFA mentality, its "Show time" i mean, people who reach 60 will have more to show and make, and also more to be proud of, so they race, but just be patient, people who play like you may having just not play as much as you
---
hope you feel fun again as most as possible ( Because you play horde, pleas Alliance stay quiet and die alone )
---
Well the gear upgrades in classic are definitely a huge deal and will stay with you for a long time if that helps! 
---
The overall pace is much slower than retail but the leveling is so much more fun (imo) that the extra time spent is enjoyable.
---
Never played end game vanilla so I can't speak to that.
---
They are still funny and chill people?? What is this comment even supposed to mean?
---
He has literally been like this for a decade
---
What did you think would happen
---
Picked RP-PvE partly to avoid all the streamers.
---
I'm rolling Alliance for the first time EVER.  
---
It's like playing a whole new game.  
---
Quests I've never done in a whole new zone.  
---
I'm playing a Paladin as well, which is weak AF (currently level 18) but I don't even care.  
---
I'm leveling my fishing and professions.
---
I have been grinding mobs.
---
Partying up with randoms to get quest groups done.
---
Running past random people who are struggling to kill a mob and heal them up and buff them with my 5 minute spells.
---
Everyone is so nice and lovely and helpful.  
---
There's banter in each zone I've been in so far.  
---
It's actually better this time around because I'm not 15 years old playing on my Friends PC.  
---
I'm a Partnered Twitch streamer as well, but don't even want to make content off it.  
---
Just want to hang out in a new world at my own pace learning stuff at my own speed and soaking in the Glorious Nostalgia that is World of Warcraft.  
---
The end!
---
Druid cleanse.
---
&gt; What the fuck is your problem always trying to make this about the other person. Why does what i care about matter to you? Does what you care about matter to anyone else? Are we going to sit here and circlejerk over how much we love hating others for the things they care about? Do the cares of anyone on the subreddit matter to any other person on this subreddit?
---
Do you know how a circlejerk works? Usually it has to do with people agreeing with eachother without any challenge to any claim or point, so I fail to see how that's even remotely true here.
---
&gt; Streamers like asmon literally don't have enough off-stream time in their life to do 'secret' projects such as a entirely "properly" leveled to 60 character. They are lying. 
---
How do you know this? This is just a wild speculation on your part.
---
I mean not really? There aren't a lot of situations you could use it in. If you're out of Mana ig.
---
Wow, thank you!
---
DM = Deadmines.
---
DM:N/W/E = Dire Maul.
---
There is no more to it.
---
“Majority”, you mean just world first people and streamers right? Probs 98% of people are playing the game normally.
---
2019 People against 2004 Farm mechanics, who found themselvs a shortcut.
---
We are an active expat group majority based in Beijing playing on OCE servers. PM me if you’re interested! Have a wechat group and guild.
---
Yeah, I didn’t mind the dailies in BC. Optional goodies for the hardcore,  but I didn’t lose sleep missing them.
---
I play GW 2 so i know what you mean but i dont want level scaling for WoW as once i grind that 60 i want people to see what i achieved not be scaled to 10 in Elwyn Forest.  
---
Thats what i want to split, if you get to raids in BC thats great you have done it. But if you go back to Vanilla content you will not have your BC raid gear, you will have your old equipment from Vanilla content. So this means that for each expansion you will have splitted progression. And  you can switch between expansions to continue your old, new progress.
---
That is ok, level up your pet and learning special talents (or spell-book to warlock) to increase his agro gained. Sorry for my english :)
---
&gt;"rush in alliance wins"
---
Ftfy
---
Sure, make sure your pet had growl, learned or from the start. Make sure its active so its used often, learn new ranks of growl from the pet trainer. Turn it off in dungeons. 
---
Lastly and I noticed this as well. Don't mana burn.   If you find yourself being out of mana it means you are using too many abilities, thus putting more damage but also getting too much aggro. For me its atm (23) hunters mark, pet attack, serpent sting and one arcane shot. Let autoshot do the rest.
---
Use your professions. See what you can make that sells for the most, see what mats you can farm that sell for the most or can be put towards making something worth more.
---
Damn son, I don't even play WoW and I feel disappointed in the guy just by reading this.
---
It hurts, but it’s the truth
---
Baby-boomer, By definition babies born mid 1960s. Basically cringy kids these days use it without knowing the real meaning, think of it as the new 'normie'.

i dont know how this comment is supposed to help me?

It's about the friends we made along the way
---
I never played fortnite but i imagine itd a lot better than retail wow
---
Caliente
---
What was that about?
---
Is there any addon that gives me some kind of note when there is some minerals to pick up. I keep missing so much on mining because i dont look at minimap all the time
---
If you think $15/month is greedy in 2019 then I don't think you use money.
---
Amen to that, finally settled on rogue tho
---
Just remember this simple acronym: [TYNAMAYNT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-iukseKI0Q)
---
If it was around in beta and not fixed then they left it. Most like to promote and allow people to play with 5 friends to level but it was simply abused. Anyway it’s not like it matters that much.
---
I know what I’m doing tonight. Cheers!
---
And that's why you think that he used layering, when he absolutely didn't. Only on the last couple levels did he use it just to speed it up because he already had it in the bag.
---
I am so sorry that you and your family are having to deal with such a loss. I worry every night my sister rides her bike home about the same thing happening (she gets home just a bit before midnight from work). I wish you and your family the best wishes I can give.
---
I bet you have thrown equal tantrums, but no one sees it obviously and no one cares, which is a huge difference between you and streamers... being hypocritical is the most ridiculous thing. You judge a human for being human....
---
He also passed on most items that dropped but I'm sure you don't care about that
---
This. People are putting these streamers on a pedestal. They want them to hit Max level and be the best. That takes a lot of time and effort if you were to do it the regular way. Dudes got 60-70k people a day to entertain.
---
I don't like how much more of an asshole he's been lately though. Like yesterday morning with the Punkrat nonsense
---
You wait 15 years for classic wow and Blizzard totally fuck up the launch by shipping with a bug that radically changes the game play experience.
---
Heads should roll at Blizzard for this
---
Hello yeah bro!
---
I have my pink plainstrider and the rake and I’m v happy! Rake is just op in pvp because of interupts:)
---
A level squish would entail more than just changing the number 120 to 60.
---
I think after completing the level 10 quest to learn Tame Beast you get another quest that teaches the teaching spell.
---
It's a slingshot icon in the General tab of your spellbook
---
Protip: With 9 hours work and 5 hours sleep you can still do 8 hour sessions!
---
Dwarfs are dumb your name elfish name
---
You forgout about doing BGs. PreCata BGs (WSG, AB, AV) were awesome to do at max level. Classic PvP is sooooo much more fun than Retail :)
---
I have been taking like 2 hours each level. Searching for quest items, struggling to kill the mobs, dying way to often. But am really enjoying this. It's such a weird feeling if you compare it to retail. There you'll level as quick as possible, don't care about anything else other than endgame.
---
This just reminded me of a Horde player in the original game that I randomly ran into/killed in the world and in Battlegrounds so many times that we became friends.  He was a Warlock wearing a Dreadmist set and I was an Alliance Warrior.  I collected a Dreadmist set while running friends through UBRS and stuff, literally just to throw it on to surprise him whenever I saw him next, so we'd match.  Carried it around with me all the time until I finally found him. He got such a kick out of it he made a whole new account just to come talk to me after and we became friends.  Completely forgot about that and don't know what happened to him but I miss that guy.
---
If you like PvE in retail or in other MMOs, you'll probably like it in Classic. I've never played anything but PvE in WoW and always had fun that way. For me Classic has been great. Some people just really like PvP, but I'm not one of those and from the sound of it neither are you. Its well worth playing for the PvE alone, give it a try!
---
Or they can do instanced content to level 60 on stream, and enjoy the outside world (ingame) when they're not streaming which is what a lot of them are doing. They do play the game other times than when they are streaming if you didnt know that
---
That’s what I tried saying but I got flamed to hell in world chat lol
---
The only way to tweak raid difficulty is to make things into hard gearchecks. Any less than that and the same folks are going to clear it first reset no matter what since the mechanics themselves are dead simple. I don't think Blizz would ever balance the base raid around the top 1% of players after what happened with Naxx. Not that I'm fundamentally opposed to some kind of Classic+ server that has increased difficulty, but if they ever deviate from \#nochanges, a separate server with an 'Experienced players only' warning is the way to go.
---
Very generous blizzard, but I think I'll pass. Find a way to make BFA more like classic without alienating any of the current BFA player base and maybe I'll think about it.  
---
Completely agree with OP
---
Classic as a whole has failed
---
I chose early on to be a warrior and go tank endgame, have to say up until lastnight when I hit SFK I doubted my choice but after am awesome SFK run and then helping some friends in WC I'm glad I stuck it out and am looking forward to 60 as a tank and then levelling my mage as a grinding machine
---
Haris Pilton was selling stuff in Shattrath during BC
---
Happens in all MMOs unfortunately, the first peeps get a big advantage. At least it’s not item duplication, although I suppose you could call layering that.
---
Isn't it funny how classic wow is like that? In bfa you could beat them probably (haven't actually played bfa) but in clasic it's like "SHIT! FUCK! RUN!"
---
What else does it do
---
Also movies are usually a projector throwing light at a screen and you are seeing the reflection of it. It’s not a light source directly blasting your eyes.
---
23.
---
sure, it's only 15% but overtime it does accumulate. What server are you on?
---
I love madseasonshow most chill voice lol
---
Silk is decent at AH. At least on our server
---
Smart move. Would keep micro-transactions and stupid shit like paid mounts and tokens away from classic - keeping it in retail where it belongs.
---
Good loot, good xp and one of the best dungeon layouts in Vanilla.
---
I actually haven't had an issue with it, but I'm playing super casually and just doing quests as I get them
---
To be honest though, judging on what he previously said, it did seem like he really wanted to play Classic *differently.* Based on all his previous criticisms of modern WoW and BfA. At the minimum, I was expecting him to do it all himself, solo, no help, grind every item, level and gold out, and show his "skill," in a sense. It's a shame, really.
---
&gt; in the end of the day your opinion meant nothing before classic came out and it still means nothing now.
---
Your opinion doesn't mean anything either in a cosmic context. So just go play and stop bothering about other people.
---
Pissed for him, he's truly missing out!
---
I am currently on my 4th character. The reason for this is because after a few hours of playing a lock and hitting level 12, my other half wanted to join in. We loaded her up an account and both made fresh paladins, I could've made anything else but it's easier to help them if I have their class right infront of me. She is picking it up surprisingly quickly and she even spent the day grinding ahead when I was stuck at work!
---
Shortly after, my friend wanted to join in. He wanted a druid. So off we go to make a new character and start the levelling process. For the life of me I can NOT remember the night elf leveling zones...
---
After another spree of teaching someone new, my sister has decided she wants in on the action. We both made night elf hunters... back to the night elf zone! 
---
I now have a 4th person playing the game and they all enjoy playing with others so I'm trying to catch them all up to speed with each other so they can all enjoy this new experience together. 
---
I could very easily show them the first 5 levels and let them figure it out, a friend of mine also wanted me to bring everyone to his Full PvP realm but no. These are people I want to join my experience in the world of Azeroth, the last thing I will do is tell them to "wait in a queue for 11 hours" and to "google" any queries they have.
---
I'm also glad that I dont have a "main" with ridiculous amounts of weath to feed them an easy experience or make them feel like they're too far behind. We're all on the same step.
---
He means content phasing. Now we are in phase 1. He wants all content to be unlocked at the same Time
---
Oh he's for sure above average, but I wouldn't ever want him on a raid team of any kind.
---
Hello. I have to seperate locations I play from.   
---
If I play at location A until 17:30, and log at Location B at 17:34, Will I need to que or is my spot saved in the realm for a certain amount of minutes?  
---
Ty
---
I have always been really nervous that blizzard will listen to people like asmongold and the other streamers for wich way to turn the game.. The truth is these guys dont Know much about the game except what you can read online and what they Remember from 2004. Blizzard Should look to real players and real guilds like APES, GRIZZLY, Progress etc for advice on how to develop the game. Even though those guilds represent the small top, they have played multiple private servers wich all are a litte different so they have seen Vanilla in so Many forms. Asmongold haven't seen a goddamn thing.
---
Yes.  There are food buffs, so if you plan on raiding, or even PvPing with your bros, or casually running 5-mans, the stat bonuses can help.
---
Mountain out of a molehill??
---
He was one of his fans though.
---
Theyre not really creating anything new. Theyre just cashing in Nostalgia from on the same old game
---
Me after grinding in barrens for 3 hrs :)
---
That's pretty much spot on. Viewers gravitate to what they are.
---
I’m doing the same thing and i think is pretty okay, not good as skinning / mining, but there’s not a big difference, i’m maxing skinning and  LW, i’ll create BiS equip from that one, then i’ll switch enginering for PvP; yes it will be a bit waste of golds to increase the level, but it’s more fun the the first option in my opinion ^^
---
You are having fun in WoW while I'm at work and
---
I'm sitting here alone in darkness waiting to be free...

You would know if you had the poison it impacts stealth and your agi goes down a lot. If you abandoned the quest before talking to the guy in TM I would try to go back to Orgrimmar in the cleft of shadows . If you did go to TM I would suggest looking for that NPC in the house. There’s a second one i never even saw because it’s directly in the corner of the house
---
I hope it is. McConnell calling him out would be great.
---
Yep so u gotta be ready to run to the tank or behind line of sight if the mob is ranged
---
Anyway this is why rogue CC sux in dungeons
---
Nice try
---
damn millennials are ruining the rare industry
---
Holy shit this guy still doesn’t understand what he’s actually saying. Read the comment you replied again and then read yours.
---
A little late
---
I honestly can't tell whether this was sarcasm or not xD
---
You describe Classic WoW and simultaneously pretend the things you said weren't true back in the day. It just reeks of jealousy.
---

The purpose of phasing is to help have that pure vanilla experience. BWL, AQ40, naxx all that were added slowly. Bgs wasn't added until later on. The idea is to release little content at a time so people can enjoy the story then add another story. It just brings excitement for each launch. Also people would get bored an quit vinalla after 2 months. Phasing will help people stay a little longer and will help casual players experience more things while the hype is still going.
---
and the down vote brigade commences, reddit is a strange place.
---
Doesn’t help when there’s a whole pile of enemies inside the building waiting for ambush lol
---
It's not about the amount of people, but the XP past 5.
---
People on this subreddit are ridiculous. They need something to complain about constantly. First it was layers, but since blizzard has largely fixed the problems from the stress test they have been looking for things to whine about.
---
It's not surprising they jumped on this.
---
Guys Asmon is a colorful stream...its Howard Stern not The BBC.  
---
If you don't like that, tune into something more safe space like Madseason show
---
I'm actually okay with his reasoning also, something along the lines of: "What we did was something new and if everyone has access to it out would break the experience for everyone else. What we wanted to do isn't for everyone - enjoy the grind, it's Classic not Vanilla."
---
This is sadly true.... damn  asmon
---
Mob is in Shimmering Flats.
---
But drops turtle meat. Hmm.
---
Why? The dungeon is the first one many people will ever enter. The dungeon came before Dire Maul was ever a thing. The dungeon needed a short name before you ever entered it, thus no newbie would know what the fuck a VC is, since they wouldn't know that Van Cleef is the final boss.
---
And lastly, because Dire Maul is easily shortened to Dire + the direction to indicate the wing name.
---
Hotfixes are usually changes to game data that is read on demand, like tooltips, names, monetary or xp values, boss or npc scripts, etc. They've almost always been able to "hotfix" things like this without restarting realms. 
---
But like another commenter said, since Legion they've also had the possibility of loading actual updates to compiled files without rebooting the server. Probably some kind of redundancy in their actual server machines. Still, I don't know if they can just load any update on the fly now.
---
It used to be that maintenance day was for updates, but now they do it much less - so probably not for any game-related updates any more. More like OS and hardware or network maintenance.
---
When someone is in such a rush to be a know it all. r/woosh
---
I hate Dailies. DESPISE THEM. My friends would always tell me "Haven't you done your dailies? I gotta do my dailies. Make sure you do your dailies!"
---
I don't want to do that. I don't want to feel pressured to do that. Sometimes I want to level an alt, or go do some RP, or just run rando dungeons with rando people for the fun of it.
---
It also always used to confuse my guildies that I'd volunteer to do arenas with them despite already doing my "Weekly". Or even start *asking* if anyone wants to do arenas. Sure, I was carrying so hard I still have back trouble, but *I just loved PvP so much*.
---
Roughly how big are the phase gaps?
---
Tbf abusing an exploit and not reporting it used to be a punishable offense
---
Do you think they would publicize that they massively messed up on their game's highest streamed days in years?
---
Auto hitting mobs doesn’t feel very hard to me but it might be the low level. I definitely don’t define hard as time consuming and imo it’s harder to pull a group of mobs in retail then killing one mob in classic. Yea you die when pulling too much in classic but that doesn’t make it more difficult, you simply pull less..
---
No because that would ruin their CLASSIC EXPERIENCE where they GRIND for HOURS to get 5gold and WILL NOT TAKE your DIRTY GOLD. You're ruining MY game REEEEEEE
---
Unless method starts grinding out bwl clears on test realms or private servers literally right now they have no chance of beating private server guilds. People were clearing bwl and Mc in like 20 minutes, making use of consumeables, mind control, soothe, combining packs. Bwl speedrunning is so punishing to fuck up and you get exponentially slower if small mistakes are made. Things like suppression room, trash skips, boss timings and positioning are run-ending, and there is a literal 0% chance apes will fuck up their bwl run. So if method prepares, and does it perfectly, they might tie. Except I would be shocked if apes isn’t literally doing bwl on a test realm in September finding another trick.
---
sweet, thank you. I was thinking about this, I have 20gb on my phone, but was thinking it'd be too slow. Might just try this 1st before buying a dongle. 
---
Thank you.
---
Baby zoomer must have died too many times =^)
---
Fairly sure paladins generally have boring dps rotations, thats only from what i've heard so you don't have to trust me haha
---
I have a level 20, 13, 7 and 5. It's gonna take a while..
---
It shows that everything is easy and there is no reward for being good.
---
You may have missed it as crazy as it sounds. I went back to the npc in the barrens, Org and then went back to TM after and hour and he was there. Can always log out to character screen and then log back in.
---
Oh gotta go find and kill him. Already ganked Nixxiom xD
---
With perhaps the exception of druid, Classic classes are all viable and are all extremely well balanced.  Its a big part of the reason the game took off.
---
I played with Defcamp a bit last year on Northdale. Definitely a chill guy and I'm glad I accidentally wound up on the same server with him.
---
ok this is great to know. I'll only get an hour or so at a time while I'm away, so that sounds good.
---
Saw a level 34 rogue yesterday with Feet of the Lynx equipped. I was like "you have no idea how much future gold you have cost yourself with that decision...."
---
Fixed*
---
Thats gatekeeping. You can play wow however you like. I think it is pathetic to beg for money and items. But it also doesn't affect my enjoyment of wow at all and i am having a blast. 
---
Can't even understand how someone cares so much about how someone else plays the game to write this rant.
---
That is also my plan and right now I'm really enjoying leveling up. Maybe don't go for warrior since they are really though the level compared to other classes like hunter or druids. 
---
I grinded for BfA flying, leveled up the new races for their heritage armor, etc too - But never really enjoyed the way to the unlocks and as soon as I got the goal I lost interest in doing anything further.
---
I also love the people rushing to 60. There's MC and Ony for next next couple of months. No BG's. No Honor. No BWL/Naxx/ZG. Have fun doing nothing i guess. I mean they managed to skip every single zone and quest of the game, just so they could kill Ragnaros a few days earlier. Good job guys.
---
Sounds more like you have a different kind of issue :)
---
Look, i'm enjoying classic. I've done DM twice and BFD once.
---
People are laughing at Blizzard because they told us we didn't want classic. BUT LOOK AT US WE DO.
---
Well it was obvious from the start, we actually don't.
---
The reason Classic is crazy populair right now is just hype, its a wave thats going to die down really fast.
---
Phase 2 will see no layering, and that a good thing, by then most servers are going to be low again.
---
Classic is old and clunky. It's fun, but its nostalgia, its 80% nostalgia.
---
I just hope blizzard sees the good points. Merge retail servers and do away with cross server tools.
---
The thing i truly love these days, seeing people are around lvl 10, noticing their names and seeing them around lvl 30 again. Doing a dungeon with 3 new people and guess what, 2 hours after the dungeon you see that mage again. But the combat? The gameplay? Thats very obviously 15years old.
---
At least, the queue times would go down.
---
Sorry but I can’t tab out until I hit 60.
---
If your talking about MOO at the time he got everyone to turn of their streams before LBRS because &lt;Progress&gt; didn't know about the tactic.
---
Calm down Steven you haven't punched anything since middle school.
---
Seems like someone didn't get invited to grind XP.
---
Everyone was told last week to change realms. 
---
People afraid to log out makes the issue worse. 
---
You chose to not change realms and you chose to be a part of the problem.
---
Youtube algorithm recommended me a few of Asmongold videos, I didnt like one of them... I dont like this dude
---
Boy are you going to be dissapointed.
---
ok ill head back to TM now and look in that house
---
Like the OP and it's discussion?
---
Any recommended raid frames for classic? Using healbot and so far it's usable but I'm sure having different ranked spells might need a different add on.
---
Yup, many of my friends who have never played before or have tried retail are loving Classic
---
And in the next quest the gnome says that he's waiting for the next dark portal to open
---
To quote you:
---
&gt; behind the camera he seems like a really nice guy.
---
How is that supposed to be taken other than to imply he's actually a better person than his persona? 
---
I dont necessarily want to start a fight with you here; I'm just pointing out that when one *plays*  a douche persona they are responsible for the climate they create, even when behind the scenes they dont indulge in that behaviour.
---
And what do you mean he seems genuine in his irl videos? Genuine about only playing a douche? Sure, but uploading two conflicting images for yourself and making money off the worse one is in of itself not genuine behaviour. He's not playing a villain in a fictional work, he's going out there acting toxic in games people play all day.
---
Greetings Traveler!
---
Wtf who cares
---
It is true.
---
I've been playing a night elf since vanilla and I've never heard of your outline being visible unless you mean when someone gets close to you and they can see you just like anyone else's stealth abilities
---
I was already feeling a little apathetic about it all, mostly because I have already leveled to 60 a year ago so I get the sense of it being the same old shit... but once I saw my friend and all yhe streamers and guildies shut themselves away in SM/dungeons to level, it hit me how much the times have changed. I can't blame them - efficiency is efficiency - but I can't help feeling like they are skipping the game.
---
Abandon quest and wait for him to respawn by the rock. It worked for me at least :-)
---
Ok level 40 is clearly a lot of spend time to start over again. Give the game a few weeks before first people will drop off, I guess the queues will be much lower soon.
---
Have always played on a dongle or hot spotted off  my phone. Vanilla through  to current content and now back to vanilla. All depends on location but wow is very forgiving
---
Nice try Bobby. Now, f**** off with your Big Freaking Abomination(of a game)!
---
And why did they not give bans or rollbacks for exploiters like they did for exp pots in retail. This can actully be damaging the ecnomoy since the early birds who expolited can make alot more money and manipulate market..
---
No reason to do them, then. They were only for vanity (Skyguard and Netherwing) or gold/pre-raid epic grind (whatever the factions on Quel'Danar was... Sunreavers?)
---
&gt;I am not sure why there are so few posts about this 
---
There are plenty of them but they never survive the /new gauntlet because they are mostly whining and venting and besides there really isn't anything to discuss.
---
They can go taller (pop caps).  They can go wider (more servers).  They've done both.  
---
"Yeah well they could provide transfers"
---
Yes, they could.
---
Ok.  What else is left to discuss?
---
What does that have **anything** to do with a rag week one kill?
---
Nobbel87 is my favorite YouTuber when it comes to Warcraft lore. If you type "x lore warcraft" in YouTube, chances are you're going to stumble upon one of his videos.
---
I find it funny how all these people claim they dont care about Asmon, but then write up posts like these.
---
Nah as long as you're having fun then keep doing you!
---
How does any of this affect your gameplay?
---
An mmo isnt about the solo content but the community which is why wow thrives, join a guild, party up and explore
---
You are slow compared to people who actively optimize their levelling to hit 60 the fastest. You are not slow compared to the fact that Classic is not a race, and that doing a lot of quests and content isn't "optimal".
---
imagine subscribing to autismgold's twitch channel and then taking the time to write a post like this
---
I actually enjoy the game though for the gameplay =\
---
Why would pre-BiS be pointless? People still won’t take you into raids if you aren’t geared.
---
There are a lot of rules in international waters lol, it just gets way more complicated when deciding who prosecutes you if you do something illegal
---
Why do so many of you care so much about these streamers? Let them play their game. They aren't hurting you, they complied with your complaints and are on their own separate server, and they are playing the game how they want to. Maybe their playstyle seems to go against what they originally said before the game came out but why does it matter to you?
---
Who cares.. it looked boring af! I'm in the meantime having a blast doing all kind of stuff and still lvl 27
---
Now we have mc and ony. Phases contain BGs and Honor system/Dire maul/BWL/AQ/Naxx
---
More importantly how did it take 16 hrs?
---
Thaanks
---
I mean even if it's not bannable there ain't no fucking way someone's gonna buy 10gold for almost 10 dollars, are you fucking serious, mate xD
---
Had a quest where i had to run to thunderbluff, and as i now need wool to make bags and level tailoring i had no use of linen i had . Rad a charity at bloodhoof village and gave away around 12 linen bags for free. People were happy, im happy , and even better my older brother is going to play wow classic too altough he wont have that much time
---
My mate (New to WoW) Started attacking a Night elf outside Ratched 5 levels above him. She knelt in front of him while he hacked away at her. He belongs.

What the FUCK is wrong with this subreddit?
---
Nice
---
I’ve said this before: 
---
People enjoy him much like people enjoy Stephen A Smith and Skip Bayless. It might be entertaining but it’s 100% bullshit and pretty close to braindead. The stuff sells though, so he figured it out. 
---
However, I don’t believe it’s possible to put on an act for 8+hours a day ~6 days a week for years on end and not become that act to a large extent. You’re free to disagree but unless you show me scientific studies proving the opposite, my mind will not be changed.
---
Just wait till she realises most female characters are actually male
---
Why the fuck would they ban people for not knowing something even Blizzard didn't know? Most people never played vanilla and would have no idea it wasn't working as intended.
---
thanks man, you were right. got it.
---
cool, a free 110 i won't play :)
---
Feels like your making shit up so you have something to qq about.
---
I remember doing that back in the day
---
Do you really want a high attack speed anyways? We don't have the original beast master tree with the good spirit bond
---
Ban incoming.
---
Dude get off your high horse. Let him play however the fuck he wants to.
---
The guy is cringe / weird, and i'm in no way defending Asmon, but classic / vanilla / private server elitist / purists are so intolerable.
---
Lol classic experience but with 2019 complaints.

Please for the love Sargeras, please stack your arrows!

There's an add-on called MoveAnything, I haven't tried it myself but it looks like it may be what you're looking for.

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/move-anything
---
I genuinely feel bad for you that you can't enjoy grinding or just levelling like that. A lot of us love that stuff. I love just sitting listening to music or a podcast, or chatting my my friends just killing boars.
---
Play the game how you want to play it, i just think it's sad that like 90% of the zones and quests you view as a chore you have to get through it seems like.
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/mrhamdota](https://www.twitch.tv/mrhamdota)
---
Perfect! Glad I can help. That has been a real pain in the ass for me
---
Outside of speedrunners classic is not a race, take it and your own pace and do what you enjoy
---
I agree with the streamer thing, but not with the hardcore part.  Those Ape guys are the extreme of the extreme. I don't think it's healthy for your game to base development on that play style.
---
i don't think this is necessarily the difference in people, but instead its the difference in the game. People have a general understanding of the difficulty in questing in vanilla. There is less of a reason to stay and help someone who does not need it in live. In classic, people need the help finishing their quests and I think that is why you see this much more often than retail.
---
a little context i played wow in vanilla and burning crusade and a little bit of wrath i didnt play much after that  
---
i miss the old days where it was about friends and having fun not rushing through the game  
---
should i come back just to help others enjoy the vanilla experience or should i just stay away still?
---
Hey it's worse if you factor in the % upvoted, over 15k people upvoted this.
---
Yeah, I don't disagree but still embarrassed!
---
I think most people pretend it doesn't exist, because what you described seems much cooler, but it's explained in the Arthas novel that came out with WotlK that he just kinda dies.
---
2019 tings
---
Im on felstriker and I prefer it, the unofficial server for people with jobs and kids hahaha
---
Potions are one of the commodities guaranteed to never go out of style, though. When raiding becomes less niche, potion prices will skyrocket.
---
because it has no real world effects in the game... there is no significant impact to the game, this isn't an economy glitch...
---
Sure, the Kaldoreï were hiding in another continent but they're a brother race from the other elves, "Quel'Dorei" or High Born / High Elves. They still have the knowledge that their ancestors posessed and dwarf are a f-ing old race too. I'm sure they knew they existed
---
Pre bis isn't worthless, APES did it with a practiced group, when you do MC you'll be probably pugging and you can bet your ass there will be wipes
---
Also, not everyone gets raid gear, it'll take you months to get the right epics so having crafted gear in the meanwhile is really worth it
---
But that’s all relative to each person. I myself give very little to no value to sports and believe scientists and engineers should be idolized. Don’t get me wrong, I know there are athletes with plenty of skill and can do some great feats relative to what they do. However, in the grander scheme of things I think their is too much fanaticism about sports than what really should be warranted.
---
What I mean is that everyone values things differently. People are fine in what they like but everyone should be able to show some empathy to how someone could find enjoyment in their own interests.
---
You get seals and judgements at some point. So you cast a buff on yourself, and then use a spell to either make that a debuff on the enemy or do damage. And then your reapply the buff in yourself and wait for the cd to do it again. Stays pretty boring.
---
But Paladins are great healers, so if you like that, just level in dungeons
---
Hasn't the community been preaching "Play the game how you want to play it"...
---
If we doesn't want to do a quest, or beg for gold, or ninja items, isn't that his choice *(and those who chose to give him gold)?*
---
Frostadamus’ videos have this effect too!
---
I used to think giving money to strippers for attention was lonely and sad, but giving money to streamers for attention is just an entirely different level of lonely
---
&gt; It's never been VC
---
Except for all of Vanilla when everyone called it VC.
---
I'm currently using ElvUi which I'm really liking for the customisability.
---
DM is Dire Maul. VC is deadmines.
---
In vanilla, they had no plans for making Pandaria a whole addon, or even plans for making it at all, so there was no pandarian design in the game, either.
---
The _only_ hint about pandaren is the chen stormstout quest in barrens.
---
Awesome man, thanks. What adds the elite portrait?
---
I think it is 2 addons. 
---
One of them 'move anything' and the other one i forgot: it displays the class symbol instead of the Portrait
---
They did promise its removal by phase 2, for now it was a necessary evil
---
Already have other names there I am fine with
---
I just love how low poly the original prairie dog is lol
---
Sounds more like whack-a-mole than “depth”
---
Oh no, those are big boy words.
---
OMG, are you for real? So you cant FD+trap if your pet is active? 
---
Do Blizz plan to fix/change that? Cos that sucks big time
---
They’re not your friend though
---
I haven't tried it in classic but back in the day it tracked essentially everything. Its pretty cool.
---
ikr. You give me 500 and id accept it in a heart beat. What about those people handing out bags to low levels? God forbid you taking handouts i need to craft those myself
---
They give you cool little costumes. People like that.
---
But this is a change? 
---
This is starting to no longer look like classic. This isn't what I signed up for.
---
This is good, if true. But i would drop the lvl 110 boost and wait for 8.2.5 release
---
I had completely forgotten what a pain that was! I have got used to it now though. Also, feeding your pet, means stocking up my valuable bag space with food!
---
Yep. Noped the fuck out of that situation lol
---
*yawn*
---
I actually enjoyed spamming SM dungeons as a Mage. I enjoy AoE grinding, but can't obviously do it atm because there aren't any spots available, so doing the 6+ man dungeons was the next bext thing to being able to AoE spam.
---
Let them leave. People that truly love classic will stay.
---
to be honest i don't see why people watch him, i watched a few videos of him and he's extreeeemly unlikable
---
It was a log session, I had just finished 225 mining/Eng beforehand. 
---
We were getting 40ish
---
Depends on cast time. A spell with a long cast time gets +21, a faster spell or an instant cast gets a bit of it. Don't remember the exact numbers, though
---
75 char minimum is fucking dumb by the way
---
There's a version of MSBT for classic
---
Elitr Player Frame :)
---
https://de.classic.wowhead.com/guides/hunter-dps-stat-priority-classic-wow

This should answer your questions :)

How does what work?

The maps are empty until you explore areas of note.

The only WoW streamer worth watching is Dan Gaming UwU.

Im not home right now but from memory maybe 
---
/w %t “you have been soulstonned”
---
wew just leveled a rogue to 51 on lights hope, you probably know better about itemization.
---
i sell nearly all leather and hides to vendors. I don't even have to kill stuff by myself, just runnig around barrens skinning every corpse i find.
---
savory deviate supreme transforms you into a pirate or a ninja for one hour. it's just cosmetic, but people like it a lot.
---
the recipe is a random drop in thr barrens, but can be found in the AH. but it's expensive, cheapest on my server was 1g 60s. when you have the recipe (needs cooking 85), you have to get the fishes. you can find them in the oases in thr barrens.
---
this will always make you money. people will always buy that.
---
not sure if this is smart or really sad
---
There's people buying video game spaceships for $1k dollars. Of course there are suckers.
---
Did you play in private Servers? If so: for how long?
---
Same. Doing LW and herb on the way to 60 but I know I’ll reach a point at 60 where I’ll be like, “hey, I think I’ll go fish.”
---
And now they're even more sure that you're all tricky fuckers not to be trusted, good job
---
My boy madseasonshow is the cure!
---
Only dipshits care about any of this.
---
I stream and have been doing classic the OG way, if anyone gets bored pop in I’ll even level in areas you wanna see @friskywhiteboy on twitch
---
&gt; Seems like someone didn't get to abuse a major experience bug in time.
---
There you go.
---
I can taste the mana!
---
You read the quest and go where you need to. Nothing is marked on the big map you see a small yellow dot on the minimap for turn in. That's it.
---
Can’t blame the players for playing the game.
---
Blizzard beta test should have got it
---
I remember the battlechests. Only way to go.
---
I'm hesitant to go fury yet. Since Dual wield needs good hitchance. Do you think it is still worth it?
---
World first happened over a decade ago. They been playing on private servers for years. It would of been sad if they werent one of the first since they knew all the ins and outs of everything.
---
I feel like I've entered an alternate reality. Maybe it was a server specific thing, but it was always referred to as VC where/when I played.
---
There was no confusion in the original wow beta when we called it VC.  It was never DM on Shadowmoon.
---
My server has a 51 Hunter on it.  That's the highest level lol
---
After quick research I will try UnitFramesPlus. Looks like original Blizzard UI with more informations. 
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/unitframesplus
---
Yep, also these guys powerleveled through dungeons so its even easier to get the gear if you have the correct classes for the dungeons.
---
Havent had it happen to me so far, only once have I even noticed layering otherwise ive always been around the same people I saw since level one
---
Imagine being in a layer with only a fraction of your server's actual population for the leveling experience.
---
Classic comes out Phase 2.
---
War is hell
---
https://youtu.be/Mbm_GslfAB4
---
This video from Bellular Gaming should have you covered.
---
yeah fire blast is absolutly used. Also there is an element spec which uses the shatter combo and fire spells
---
Just reroll opposite faction and destroy them in pvp.
---
I want that now :3
---
They get recognized elsewhere too. Especially the bigger ones
---
Doing a few dungeons (WC, SFK, BFD) allowed me to mostly skip Stonetalon Mountains and Hillsbrad and I'm already at 30, so I don't think it's that big of an issue.
---
If you DC during queue there is a 6minute grace period where you will go back to your original position.
---
Preach it man.
---
I'm super envious, I wish I could have experienced video games with my parents
---
The commenter above me was talking about him being a troll. You are right the op never mentioned trolls but you probably have difficulty with reading comprehension
---
Hey, I guess thousands of people just made it up.
---
If some Russian randoms can run private servers with thousands of players for ten years then blizzard can absolutely do it.
---
 [https://classicwow.live/leveling](https://classicwow.live/leveling)   
---
I used that guide for everything. Has been a very smooth time! lvl 39 and running!
---
I have no idea why you're being downvoted here(other than the bootlicker comment, that's a bit much). They absolutely botched it. Everyone knew they were being way too conservative with the initial number of servers. Everyone knew people who hadn't played in 10+ years were trying to make detailed plans with their old friends and guilds and create consensus with large groups of people on where to play, while having a very limited amount of options. A lot of these groups changed servers 2, 3, 4+ times. Now everyone's getting split up left and right. And they're still being told "It's their fault, gosh. Should've rerolled 60+ people a FIFTH time".

This is a nitpick and I can learn to live with it, but if you want to get specific Blizz really didn't deliver Classic exactly as we wanted it either(unfucked with). Spawnrates for mobs are totally out whack, making some quests extremely difficult to do because mobs spawn so fast it's almost impossible to kill them fast enough to get to whatever quest objective you need. Increased rates make sense in a lot of places but the one-size fits all approach to an entire world at once is not ideal.
---
Hey what’s the name of that addon that changes the quest log like that? I knew I had an addon missing but couldn’t tell which one lol.
---
Good luck :)
---
Literally how I feel about all those streamers who levelled in wow. And that guy who got world first lvl 60.
---
Like, honestly, do you honestly expect me to believe you got level 60 without begging for gold or items? without being given a free ride while the rest of us struggled?
---
Like, grats lvl 60. But damnit. u didnt struggle.
---
49 Human Warlock, clocking in at 4d4h played. Back to work now tough :(
---
The amount of "oh shit!" abilities you can pull out of your bag is amazing. I'm leveling with a friend and we were in a cave, pull 2 and get 6.. then 8. I pulled out all my totems, used other spells for damage while running out of mana. My friend did whatever a warrior can do, and we came out of the fight alive, though fairly low health. We were around level 20 at the time.
---
No worries best of luck
---
Not going to lie. I really needed this, made me chuckle and smile a bit. Thanks!
---
Engineer? Nice my 16 rogue got the second set of goggles and I now have so much more hp than everyone my level. Makes questing easier as someone who can't heal
---
Good, now I don't feel like I made a mistake with my choice of class.
---
He does not, that was changed in 1.9
---
Apes bout to move to retail just to destroy method again.
---
May I ask which server? Yesterday I was leveling at Desolace and saw a lock like you
---
More abilities in retail? lol, ask a warlock
---
Yup, and casting a Renov, a Rejuv, Thorns before speeding off in Cat Form!
---
To each their own, but to be honest, some iconic PVP zones/experiences are as much a part of the vanilla experience as raiding MC. Tarren's Mill is one that comes to mind. Stranglethorn. 
---
Nowadays we appreciate being able to turn Warmode off, but we didn't want to miss out on that aspect of classic WoW. We're still not too keen on being ganked while leveling.
---
It's not a race man, I wasnt a huge fan of retail so the thrill of actually leveling, questing and struggle to stay alive as a solo rogue is bringing me the nostalgia I was hoping for. I'm currently level 22, unsure on hours but most is spent afk, dying or working on professions.
---
This night, someone got laid
---
Calling it now: Asmongold is going to read this while live tomorrow and laugh at that part.
---
Thats exactly my point dude.
---
Major experience bug? That's overexaggerating by a mile. You realize people can still farm these dungeons in 5-man groups, and the XP/HR has only slightly diminished.
---
Amazing that people think the way you end the N the word is remotely relevant
---
There's some static data on the client that they can't update live, like tooltips, but a lot of things happening on the server like damage calculations were fair game.
---
Hah! Just did that quest yesterday - must have killed at least 50 of those shield dudes before i got the shield.
---
Because you can see their health bar growing and you feel like you're actually helping?
---
Getting metroid prime vibes
---
This is WoW at its best for sure
---
&gt; But its so bizarrely inconsistent.
---
Welcome to MMORPGs in the early 2000s, where not even the devs had a clue of how to make them.
---
The whole game is _one_ big inconsitency, but that is, on the other hand, what makes it intriguing to explore. 
---
There are zones which are objectively bad designed, and nobody ever quests in them, because they are _literally_ unfinished (Dustwallow as alliance for example, or the more or less empty Azshara). 
---
But why do I like that? Because it lacks any form of streamlining content. The _do whatever you want how you want_ aspect of the game is very strong. While there is always a best way, there are so many ways to be good. It's not like retails "do a 10+ key a week, a few world quests a day, 4 islands a week, and you are done" - checklist style gameplay, where the devs set what you have to do to not fall behind. No, in classic, I don't care if I fall behind, because it doesn't matter.
---
layering tho
---
&gt;We thought more highly of you
---
I used to watch him as background noise. But I never thought very highly of him as far as his principles go. It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that this manchild, who has had gold and items and raid loot just thrown at him, would beg and plead for all these things on Classic, too. Classic has only outlined how absurd his personality and streamer benefits are on a game where this kind of behavior (to the level of streaming and having a huge fanbase) didn't really exist back then. He's completely gone against the spirit of the game and he is 100% a retail baby. I have much more respect for players like Esfand and Sodapoppin than that ghoul.
---
WotLK had  important enchants tied to the rep. And high level of rep. It was already a problem there.
---
its nice, cause its a gift. I say Thank you blizz, i will make a nice alt out of this.
---
He was never good, he was always this.
---
Don’t forget that Warcraft II had sea turtle units...
---
You say that like there's something wrong with people who like to level fast.
---
Saw this while I was sat on  the bus, laughed so hard people started to stare.
---
Thanks for that.
---
No, you'd just compare him to Ragnaros in an environment without his elemental servants and slaves. If you're taking away fire from Rag then the proper equivalent would be to take Frostmourne, the Crown, and probably all that plate armor away from Arthas as well. His skin too while we're at it.
---
&gt; it should be a pretty disappointing experience if they think that's what the actual game is like.
---
it is like that if that's how they want to play.  
---
That's the magic, you have choices in how to play.  
---
Just because someone plays differently that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the way you want to play, especially since it has absolutely 0 direct impact to you.  
---
Gatekeeping has always been an absurd, egomaniac and shallow way of thinking.
---
Amazing.
---
They were not participating in world first, but their stream clearly captured their players by vast margain the most. In addition, they advertised their streams with thumbnails and descriptions of going for world first.  
---
I don't get this drama, if you are going to advertise yourself going for world first while not going to, just for marketing, then yea, I would say people are free to assume you are participating and trash you a bit when you don't succeed
---
take my upvote.
---
Or those mechanical watcher things in Westfall that are immune to agro and fear spells #warlock
---
Imagine watching twitch streamers. Why people like watching twitch streamer play games rather than playing the game?
---
Nice, I'll take a look
---
It's part of the game, get over it or cry more whatever.
---
Sure. I guess thousands of players all made it up at the same time.
---
Great business plan - "there are suckers" xD
---
Classic is a major grind-game, the difference is that you decide the pace no matter what. You're not missing that Siberian Titan Valerian Steel upgrade by not committing to dailies, you just sack a biiit more behind the pros, which is fine cos the majority is casual players with a life. 
---
Speed levelers took time off and nolifing for a couple of days to get worlds first. If an average player tries to mitigate that kind of pace, he/she will soon find out that it is not going to happen with a normal life. 
---
It kinda reminds me of the standards influencers/models etc. sets for the youth - that you have to look like this and that, and can do it by buying this and doing that. Any person with a sence of logic thinking will soon abandon the urge to look like those models, and keep life going as usual, maybe even better because of some self-realization or whatever. Classic players will also keep the pace on their own i believe.
---
Fuck this village. Only yesterday I died 3 times in a row trying to do the rogue quest, which I don't even know where to find it lol. This place is packed...

---
As an OG Vanilla player, this is weird.
---
The streaming community seems to have a host of bullshit and drama, and this is wholly new to the environment in terms of similarities with the OG release.
---
The streaming community has created massive queue times and has active plans to screw the economy on more than one server.  It's a whole new dynamic that I really don't love, tbh.
---
I was 24 when WoW came out, and I have to wonder why people get involved in any of this or give a fuck at all what some streamer does, or thinks. 
---
This whole layer of drama and garbage isn't a great addition to gaming.
---
BBRROOO yes thanks! Totally forgot about this.
---
Asmongold always talks like he’s the voice of the players but he looks for shortcuts like everyone else. He’s always just been ok in my book cause he always acts like he has a better idea of the game but then acts like he’s worshipped and that if he doesn’t like it his fan base will back him up.
---
I set an alarm to go off every three hours, despite having to go to school, so I would wake up and check the spawn in the cave in ungoro for the albino gorilla. I used him for years. The thunder clap was just too good.
---
I have my Philips Hue bulbs in my office. They're connected with the Hue Sync app when I play wow. It's so good that it even flashes my room red whenever my Fire Nova Totem explodes.
---
Same reason people watch sports instead of playing it.
---
less abilities? in vanilla? you kidding right? tons of base abilities and then bunch more when downranking...  
---
retail is pruned more and more with every expansion.
---
Plz delete your Tauren and make an alliance. :)

Be careful in your solo ventures. While it’s certainly possible to have plenty of fun dual wielding, it will make fighting mobs slightly higher than you slightly more annoying. The hit rating needed for dual wielding is a cruel mistress, I would suggest having a 2 handed backup weapon in case you find yourself missing a bunch of attacks on an orange level mob.
---
However, this isn’t fool proof either, just theoretically better. So just do whatever makes you have the most fun.
---
I'm aware, but this house looks nothing like Elven architecture. The windows are round, the roof is red. Nothing Elven in WoW has a red roof, not even 15 years later in BFA. The house is strapped to a giant turtle. We know Samwise already created Chen during that time, he could have added this for fun.

Go back to retail.

I never thought highly of that douche nozzle ever lol... He is a virus.

You're correct. Everyone else is a pleb class compared to this comp.
---
Yes absolutely use your whole arsenal. Fire blast is always good since its instant cast. as nyy said its also good if you know you are about to get interrupted, then they interrupt the wrong school. better than duking by a long shot.
---
Though still doesn't stop frost bolt being best sustained
---
The few times I've dabled in retail, when Blizz has given me free time. 
---
All I usually ended up doing was taking my Character to solo stuff like UBRS/LBRS, Strat, Strath, and old content. I don't think I'll be needing to do that any longer.
---
i dont know about fireball specifically but most of my spells are like double the damage of the previous rank for less than double of the mana and casting time is increased by like .5 seconds. So seems like higher dps and more mana efficiency to just cast the higher rank even if it takes a bit longer to cast.
---
Bear in mind that with the extremely high population number on PvP servers, questing will be a pain in the butt especially in those exact levels (STVietnam). Grinding dungeons is a way to avoid being ganked to hell and back.
---
I think the reason we're on classic is because we don't like retail already.
---
Ironic
---
Imagine thinking others need to care as little as you do about shit that doesn't matter. Let OP exist in his little bubble, and you in yours.
---
People speedrun the shit out of wow and then complain about 'lack of content' lmao
---
I'm new too, and I very much enjoy it
---
different strokes for different folks I'd say
---
PSA you dont have to put it on FFA loot to share quest items after some of your party members have completed a quest. Those who have completed the quest are simply unable to see (or loot) the quest items, and once a corpse has been looted by its designated group loot character, any remaining loot becomes FFA, including the quest drops.

How much weapon dps on a non axe-weapon do I need to get to make it worth dropping my WW-axe as a warrior?

Dropping axe will drop me 5% crit due to axe spec. So basically how much weapon dps is 5% crit worth? (ponderings of a lvl 39 warrior)

Same bro! Filthy casuals ftw

No-one (except Bajheera's viewers) is watching wow streamers work out. They're watching them play the game, like you watch lebron play the game.

I've been saying that classic really proves that there is more money and fandom to be made from a WoW2 rather than another expansion

Why didnt you kill him?
---
Hell yea, green iron brother! I am at 19 now, fishing,/cooking at 120, FA on 95, BS on 98, looking forward for getting there!
---
So have i though. Have levelled to 60 more times than i cant count on many private servers. Raided Ony and MC. I'm still having fun doing this.
---
I don't get why they want to rush to MC and Ony if they've already clreared it a thousand times though.
---
The thing is that this is better than any private server levelling because of all the people and the community right now. The raids are at least the exact same. They can suit themselves i guess.
---
 Right? This right here is why I rolled PVE. "Ain't got time for this."
---
I'm just waiting to break away from the big group of levelers. I hit 20 on Mankrik but my buddy wanted me to play on Atiesh, so I swapped and am about 19.5. I've 100% cleared Elwynn, Westfall, and Loch Modan according to questie. I'm going to clear Darkshore for the shits n gigs then hit up ashenvale. Will probably have to rotate Ashenvale and Red Ridge a bit.

Oh wait Asmon has double standards!? color me surprised...
---
Please don’t post this crap here.
---
You either need better friends or youre skewing this as a one sided story. Just reroll on another server or faction?
---
One of my favourite things while leveling is that you need to travel a LOT.  You do a bunch of quests in 1 zone then need to move on... You do some more across the world and then maybe you go somewhere else for a dungeon.  Then you go to a third zone, get some levels - then you head back to the first place to take on higher level stuff you couldn't do before
---
My statement is not irrelevant. Why do 80k people watch someone? You REALLY need an answer?? 
---
The fact that so many people watch him shows all the reasons why (hint: it’s not because they think he’s boring). His question was disingenuous cause the answer is obvious even to him.
---
Are you able to use string functions in macros? If you are, it seems to me, that you could replace GetIemInfo(y) == "Minor Healthstone" with string.find(GetItemInfo(y),"Healthstone") ~=nil, letting the macro find any healthstone, and not just Minor. It should still be within the 255 character limit.

Tell me your story
---
That's not the point though.
---
The point OP is making is that people like these openly advocated for the values of vanilla as stated in my quote from his post, and then proceeded to do exactly the opposite. It says something about people who act that way.
---
If anyone had stated they wanted to enter classic in order to speedrun to 60 while using the most efficient routing, grinding, use of specific mechanics, etc. there would be no problem with it. Take for example that one guy who was world first 60 on his mage. He said he would do it, he practised for it and he achieved it. More power to him.
---
yeah but ppl are saying that they hadnt streamed anything. who cares about 54-60, the rest was way longer period
---
Herb is off normal trainer :-) Cooking you have to buy a book, for horde it's in desolace. Guessing the same for alliance.
---
I think most folks will horde boe’s for awhile, let gold inflation happen
---
No i mean it sure as hell is no where near as complex as it is nowadays both in retail and pretty much any other game you play.

It's honestly way better today than it has ever been. I think people are no longer anti-afking as much now that the release week hype has slowed down.
---
he is top streamer? that tells a lot about the community. i couldnt watch him for more than 5 mins

Sorry to bother you with what is possibly a stupid question, but I’ve hit honoured with my own faction, and did it quite quickly. This is all you need for the discount, yes..?

What was the best way for you to level each skill? Did you have a herb path to loot them and or did you buy the herbs from AH?
---
I fully agree with you. The amount of toxic people I’ve met this week is unimaginable. I love the game, just the wow community has gone to shit.
---
I absolutely love this and wish at was in all expansions, but I also understand that it would feel weird to some people that after defeating Deathwing, Archimonde, Kil’Jaeden and everything else the NPCs that you travel with don’t even recognize you. It is a problem with an ever expanding world like WoW.
---
Sometimes a bug fix can take days to find, determine a fix, test said fix and then deploy.
---
It's not so simple my friend.
---
Not sure who told you leveling is fun, its the community who makes this game great.. And its this community aspect blizzard killed with crossrealm/lfg/lfr/throwing legendarys arround.. Thats why its better for newer player.. Community is less toxic and u have a ton of opportunities to make friends.. If u want to log in and get all your epics/legendarys within 30min after, i guess retail is great for u. If u want a game u play with others and have fun with them go for classic..

---
I don’t need to rehash everything. I just want to play a game that I like. Asmongold is a toolbag. He constantly changes his stance mid-sentence and argues nonsense in a full circle. Expecting him to treat classic appropriately was a huge mistake.

Downranking useally only makes sense if you have a lot of spell power or don't have enough mana to cast max rank by the end of a fight. I useally calculate myself what is the most mana efficient heal or dmg at a given lvl. Simply divide average damage with mana cost to get a dmg pr mana spent. It's feels really good to do your own 'research' and deciding between conflicting opinions of others can feel fustrating.
---
How would you make this possible? Blizzard employees watching endless video of streamers?

Check the sub. It’s been asked a few times.

Skinning and leatherworking go best together. Down the line of leatherworking you can make blues. So it’s super helpful if anyone of your guild members happens to get medium leather etc
---
You should just start fresh on a new server. Begin a new chapter and enjoy the game. I know it will be hard to get past this whole incident, but you shouldn't let those people take away something you've been looking forward to for so long.
---
**NO !**  
---
You have to play the game how **I want** otherwise you are RUINING **MY** GAME.  
---
HOW DARE YOU NOT RELVIVE THE ***CLASSIC EXPERIENCE***
---
The answer is both yes and no. Since there are some people 50+ it's a fool's errand asking such things.
---
Of course it is, that's the point. Vanilla is for people who want a harsher experience compared to pretty much MMO out there. Hell, you want a "really bad" experience? Try playing Kronos like I am that's as dead as a doorknob where there's currently eight goddamn people in Durotar. I had to solo raid that damn Familiar cave (To the point where it's pretty much a stealth game of trying not to aggro more than one enemy at once and then having to fight your way back out because by then the enemies have respawned, dear god) and I have no clue how I'm going to get past that one boss scorp I can't remember the name of without grinding out quests for several levels above that thing and then just coming back and curbstomping. Again, go back to retail. That was obviously meant for you.

Just roll into a clever rogue and outwit your opponents or bore them to death with facts.
---
Thanks for the input (to everyone answering)! 
---
Next time I encounter a similar scenario I'll talk it out, instead of coming to reddit to rant about it lol
---
As someone else said, if they're trying out classic coming from retail, the games look similar but are very different, so it's understandable they try and play them the same way.
---
Putting aside that we've now gone from "they should have known" to "this is a conspiracy between blizzard and APES (not method for some reason) to make sure the first rag and onxiya down were within a week" (which is fucking stupid). It doesn't change what I said. 
---
The exploit wasn't on display in onixya or rag. Anyone watching it would have had to go back through the literal 100s of hours of (often overnight) streaming for a game these people already are likely crunching 80 hours a week to tweak to identify a bug that didn't actually lower the world first run beyond the possible. no reported the bug (again it only took a few hours after the report for blizzard to fix it). How is it reasonable to demand that blizzard be watching all the thousands of streams, just on the off chance someone uses an unreported bug, when the bug those people were using is easily reportable via multiple different official channels and apparently observed by more than a million people? Why did it take so long for anyone to report it?
---
The fact of the matter is that as soon as it was actually reported to blizzard it was fixed. Maybe if you were so concerned about it you should have reached out to blizzard. Rather than waiting til they fixed it and then complained at they're not watching twitch 24/7 like you. Why didn't any of the literal *million* people watching come here or the official forums go report it if it was apparently so blindly obvious?
---
It was definitely this for me. Fussing with the anti aliasing was like a person wearing the wrong glasses putting on another pair of glasses in attempt to fix the problem.
---
But once I changed the resolution, everything looked as it should.
---
I assume you have to be in the same zone, just like sharding.
---
Probably because we have had a year of him saying what he will do every day. And then from Day 1 he went back on everything.

Most amazing effect Classic has had on me is the will to perhaps roll a lvl1 retail again. That never even entered my mind running around nonstop trying to catch up with crap on my 120s, and still feel like nothing is ever good enough and the frustration of getting declined on all groups because I'm trying to get something, but I'm declined since I don't already have it... wtf design.
---
There was some horde at the west fall shore yesterday, I did the sensible thing. /sniff /stink /split then let everyone know in /1 there was some horde to gank. Good times.
---
How can you sit there and judge the way someone plays a fucking game? I wish i could see life through your eyes so i can see how you ended up with such a fucking retarded opinion
---
Tho, D2 gave you multiple choices on how to play a character, even multiple choices in certain specs.
---
Classic doesn't do that. It is usually obvious what is good and what is pointless. It is just the illusion of choice. Plus, many classes have "dead" talent trees.
---
Does anyone know a good frost mage leveling spec? Trying to find venruki's but I can't find it. Non blizzard version would b best.
---
As long as Person 2 is looting everything.
---
Everyone with any sense expected the raids to get cleared very quickly. Maybe not 5 days quickly, but within two weeks. Doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things whether it was 5 or 12 days. Anyone who's surprised and discouraged by this is, quite frankly, probably someone who hasn't followed the vanilla scene at all and is less likely to have stuck around regardless.
---
Definitely man, this shit has been some of the most fun I’ve ever had, all over again.
---
Ran both comps, warrior comp is more consistent/safe and less intensive to grind without much exp loss. Main scenario is where stray mobs escape the group the tank herds them back.

I'm Zandalar too. First time playing an RP server it's a lot more relaxed and way more fun imo
---
I am 41 and I only did a few dungeon runs. It's been near impossible to get into an SM group though as a Paladin. I ask to heal or DPS, no one wants to invite me. I understand that I play a lot, so I am ahead of the curve on leveling, but still, its disheartening.
---
Amazing thanks.
---
Hey, thanks amigo. I'll check that out :)
---
Aye, there should be a section for run aimlessly around the starter areas for herbs or waiting for rare to spawn, spent hours at that.
---
can some one explain like I'm 5 this??
---
At least on Mograine EU chat is absolutely filled to the brim with Speedlevelers looking for groups. Feels like half the server at least. Seems like a race to me, but then again this is the server of the world first 60 char, so that might have an effect.
---
Are you on Herod?
---
There is no official word on when character realm transfers will be available.

Here is a post on wowhead from 2008 where they discuss deadmines being called VC https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=31459 It was DEFINITELY a thing in a classic. Yes, I know that 2008 is after classic, but this is not some new thing from private servers or peope misremembering. Many servers (at least on US) called deadmines VC. It's fine if that changes and the community decides to call it DM now, but to downvote and try and claim that everyone here has had some false experience is ridiculous.
---
no longer possible sadly, I plan on getting similar functionality with tellmewhen (can use weak auras too).
---
Then it gets hacked every weekend and it's a PR nightmare.
---
I mean they obviously figured it out, but the point OP made holds true
---
I am tempted to award you gold for such a comment but I cannot continue to live my life knowing I would have aided alliance scum
---
I'd have kicked them out of my guild in a second
---
I thought that Dire Maul hadn't released yet?
---
If you rely on other people to make such trivial decisions then I don't know what to tell you...
---
Looks like someone is trying to hack my steam account again
---
This is kinda true for most of the internet, Reddit itself is a pretty good example. 99% trash content and memes, 1% actual discussion and quality content.
---
Easiest way /fastest way to get exhaulted with IF (im a human and want ram mount). Thx!
---
LBRS is meant to be 10 manned i don't see how you are using that as an argument for the 10 man AOE farming which was done in things like SM,ZF which people  are saying they did.
---
.oN
---
That‘s kinda dumb
---
Yes, its not viable at least as a warlock
---
I really love that @cursor macros work in classic. Thanks for sharing OP!
---
Pre-Hot yourself for extra threat.
---
Stay hydrated and stretch.  Dont forget to empty your pee bottles daily or they begin to smell.
---
What I like a lot that I forgot (I started on 2005) is that sometimes I just kill mobs to level before going to the next quest chain because I will be better 1 level higher.
---
In retail you don't care about it.
---
&gt; *There are* ***69*** *replies with an estimated read time of* ***6 minutes****.* 
---
**Nice.**
---
Everyone I know who watches lower leagues that are not directly linked to their town are betting addicts.
---
You will have to coordinate with them
---
Cooking is meh but you can reliably fish out good health/mana potions and leather from wreckage.
---
Uhm shouldnt you guys be questing or spamming 5 spellcleave/meleecleave?
---
I agree war comp is better but swinging in to say most exp farm runs skip boss. Also many bosses can be zerged anyways.
---
I totally agree. All the world pvp right now is fun, but it’s missing that direct reward...
---
maybe you should be more than 12 years old?
---
Amen brother! 🤣
---
I’ve done this every time I’ve grouped with someone, and visa versa. It’s so refreshing to have people who are patient and helpful in an MMO.
---
Paladins and warlocks
---
Since this hit the front page can someone explain what this is about?
---
Everyone had access to all the same tools.
---
Im sure theres plenty of people browsing here that would love to play along with the hype but aren’t able to, hopefully it goes to someone that really wants it!
---
Pinning for myself to check out later lol
---
Wow, this really makes me wish I rolled on an RP server. Lol
---
The opposite of a casual isn't a neck beard.
---
I liked leveling from 1 to 120. :(
---
I’m at 15 and I am surprised I made it to 15 in a week.
---
Couldn't agree anymore.
---
Buicha more like Butcha
---
&gt; This isn't how it worked in vanilla. 
---
If you actually read what they said, then you will know you are wrong.
---
I just ignore everything related to twitch, it's pure cancer.
---
While the dungeon XP was important to fix, abusing layers for farming rep/crafting materials which is currently on-going will be pretty detrimental to players and economy.
---
Best option would be to remove the 40% exp bonus that they got. Wouldn't be a punishment but just a fix to the amount they should have gotten in the first place.
---
However I don't think that they can track raid groups and the exp they've got so easily.
---
Poor guy has been leveling to level 8 with no abilities.
---
How sad must someone be to actually give a shit about this? Go outside and go for a walk or something
---
It was always a walk in the park... we were just shit at the game back then :)
---
The game doesn't change... 
---
It just means the raids will be on farm a lot quicker than expected.
---
I'm only a couple of paragraphs in and all I can think is that you have the wrong gaming friends. New server, new friends
---
Thorns is the best buff I've ever gotten as a warrior. It is mad damage.
---
Date of birth? Skoogles
---
Right now you don't need to farm pre raid blues or fire resist gear. That is taking a lot of content/activity away from casuals.
---
Yes! Or when your party or raid wipes and you survive (hello rogues, I see you hiding out there).
---
Falling off gryphons? 
---
You're experiencing the true vanilla experience
---
&gt; Just cause you can only kill one or two mobs at the time doesn’t make auto hitting harder
---
Might have found the source for your lack of enjoyment here. I'm definitely not only able to kill 1-2 mobs at a time. 
---
&gt; and piss easy boring
---
If Classic is "piss easy boring", what's retail then?
---
\+1 for not coming back
---
1. You dont need any expansionpacks, just the suscription afaik
---
2. Not really, its now in the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) client, where u select 'Classic wow' under the 'WoW' section to download the game once ur sub is active.
---
3. Game runs really well on older computers/laptops
---
4. Not sure, dont think so
---
We just ran a RFC with as a group of friends. Shenanigans ensued and half the time we were saved only by the fact that we had a druid tank, warr off/DPS, two shamans and a priest to get through it. In any normal composition we would die on second pull. Waiting for the tank to actually do his job is core dungeoneering knowledge in Vanilla.
---
So you tanked MC with a fishing pole...in your bags?
---
I actually know someone this might work on. He lost his old account, came back for classic. And if he really wants to move forward, he could this way
---
That sorta thing happens all the time in retail. Especially populated areas.
---
Playing hunter in NE area lvl7-10 before getting pet was the most frustrating thing in my entire wow life.
---
Bigtits4lyfe
---
Hahaha
---
patch .10 added a pentalty for raid exp, not sure what you're talking about. It's working as intended now
---
Druid and shaman get the most out of it, but all that stam makes it good for anyone who can wear it.
---
Wait do people actually refer to Deadmines as VC?
---
Do people refer to Deadmines as anything other than DM?
---
I agree
---
Haha , I might follow you after someone claimed I’m salty and dying. Weird ppl man
---
I definitely think 2 more points in wand spec but idk it seems pretty good otherwise
---
Thanks. I'm looking for a steamer that actually plays the game. I was getting real bored of people in dungeons.
---
Also fuck asmogold or whatever. I don't get his type of "personality" or how they become so famous.
---
I am continually amazed that people do not understand Asmongold and the gimmick of his character.
---
Streamers are characters. At least the most popular ones are. 
---
I guess being a fan of pro wrestling allows me to see a gimmick when one is presented.
---
  I would miss many of the "good features" - LFG, shared mob tagging, heirlooms  GOOD FEATURES \`? LOL
---
Kubernetes is way too overpowered for our own good.
---
Retail is garbage. Nothing feels satisfying in the game anymore.
---
Yea this isn’t even realclassic for me. 
---
I played beta. I played OG classic. I played when you could 45 second polymorph the random horde just to piss him off.
---
I never saw people aoe grind. I was in one of the top 10 or so raid guilds in my server. People didn’t get their epic mounts for months or years.    I saw a few people have gotten theirs.
---
I am sorta enjoying classic. But this is nothing like how it really was. This is “fake” classic.
---
People are comparing end game raid "rotations". In vanilla this usually means just spamming the highest damage/most efficient ability to the exclusion of everything else.
---
Of course it's a poor comparison, not only because there are debuff limits to consider, but also because the combat is not really designed around just doing target dummy dps. The depth in vanilla wow combat comes from having a massive toolkit and using it effectively under a variety of circumstances. So to compare only a single one of those circumstances (and not even the best one), is a bit flawed. 
---
In other words, retail classes only have a hammer, which they use for all situations. The retail hammer is incredibly polished and undeniably better than the vanilla hammer. However, the vanilla player also has a wrench, pliers, a hacksaw, 4 different types of screwdrivers, an awl for that one time they encounter a rogue, and even a tape measure that isn't really useful in combat but nevertheless improves class flavor.
---
A better comparison might be PvP, where classes *do* use a great portion of their toolkit. In classic, you may be expected to utilize well over 30 keybindings depending on your class and whether you're an engineer.
---
Discount: 15% revered, 20% exalted.
---
Also exalted with other factions lets you get their mounts.
---
I don't think it remotely affects anyone's experience but their own. I'm still gonna be grinding to 60 wth my guild and running those raids when we're ready. Hopefully before phase two, definitely before I stop playing the game. 
---
Folk were always gonna smash the content super fast. The bug just shaved off a couple of days. It's not something you should worry about
---
It might impact you once you try to group up. If a rush/race playstyle permeates the community then it WILL impact your playstyle.
---
I think it's you.
---
Lol. I always wondered why rogues (played hunter mainly) get a bad rep then during a dungeon my team wiped with just the mage left. Because of aoe she had aggro of all the rest. She blinked miles away. I'd been attacking the boss and got crippling poison on him. Trying to chase down the mage to take a little aggro to see if we could salvage, the boss was lagging behind. So I thought. Perfect time to finish him. Mage died, all other enemies came at me.... Vanished and waiting for them to return. Can understand slightly now
---
Who actually cares? The way asmongold plays the game doesn’t change how you or anyone else plays it. He hasn’t ruined the game for anyone with what he’s doing. I’m not even a fan and I don’t see what’s wrong with it.
---
Long-dong Johnson
---
Did u humble brag????
---
Yeah, dungeons outside sm exist. Watch asmon, esfand or w/e and then multiply their efficiency 5 times.
---
 ❤️
---
The... ISIS... guild?
---
What about that fat guy? Tipsy or something what happened to him?
---
Engineering is a fun one, and even compliments some of the weak points of the paladin. Grenades as an example are excellent for ranged pulls, which the paladin lack, or stunning a mage or hunter kiting you. As you are not in a rush, make sure to run along mountains and rocky areas when you traverse the zones to maximize mining gains.
---
How would they know it's a bug?
---
Prairie Dog Boyz!!

R/FuckImOldApparently

Is it enjoyable to those who can spare few hrs per day to place classic wow ? Again i’m talking about new players like myself. Imagine I have to play 4 hrs or so to kill mobs cause i need to level up to progress so I can do quests, while doing that you need to catch up with ppl to either kill mobs or do a quest but those are playing more and they need to keep progressing. Got my point ? In retail yes I’m 68 but I enjoyed leveling and doing quest and I think it’s more viable for new wow players to experience that and enjoy the game concept instead getting frustrated sometimes to even find a group to do one quest. Cheers
---
I'm glad I watch these streams for them and not the game. Soda has been on that grind but I just watch him.
---
Ah, finally something to do while I wait for a mate who confirmed we meet at 5 p. m. just for him beeing half an hour late followed by him having to prepare stuff for another 30 minutes.
---
But that‘s not really sad is it? This way you are not forced to pick those go to pets because otherwise you‘d be at a disadvantage.
---
&gt; Might have found the source for your lack of enjoyment here. I'm definitely not only able to kill 1-2 mobs at a time.
---
how many do you kill then? you able to kill groups of 3? Unfortunately not possible as solo shaman
---
&gt; If Classic is "piss easy boring", what's retail then? Most newer games these days are much easier than Classic ever was and will be.
---
I would call Queen Azshara in the Eternal Palace raid difficult, especially since not many have killed her yet even on normal. The leveling definitely isnt difficult in retail either.
---
We (lvl 20 troll rogue, lvl 17 undead priest) were already in SW! And died many times. :D
---
I don’t understand why a person like him is a thing. When a majority of players would agree that the toxic elitist assholes like him are what make the game unbearable. He does nothing but talks down to people in his stream chat and in game. He is just all around a toxic person. So to be one of the most popular “wow people” is beyond me. 
---
Hes an average player. Not really better than anyone other player. And the whole “you made a mistake, you’re an idiot” but then he makes a mistake and it’s a “game flaw” or “oh that wasn’t my fault” is just fucking laughable. 
---
In general, he’s a toxic player that does nothing but ruins the experience for anyone who has to do anything with him.
---
&gt;What a load of bullshit. If you are getting less xp/hour in a 5 man dungeon spam than what youre getting from 10-man farming your comp and your skill sucks. There is a reason why the top guilds are all running 5-man groups and not 10.
---
That is exactly what he said.
---
IF you get LESS EXP in a 5 MAN than a 10 MAN - YOUR COMP AND SKILL SUCKS
---
It is right there.
---
Why elementals?
---
Just make them [Wildhammery](https://fineartamerica.com/featured/form-of-the-bear-ryan-barger.html) and based on [animals you find in Dun Morogh.](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c70cf73a1e14ba081befeea0ee32726/tumblr_p51ukgNugT1trhin5o1_1280.jpg)
---
It's worth doing as it's an easy way to level cooking if you buy recipes from vendors. It can also make a good amount of money if you put in the effort. It's a great way to balance out a profession like engineering which can be a money drain.
---
Mostly I use it to stock up for food to keep my warrior out in the field longer.
---
So is he the designer who put the Alliance Warlock Succubus quest on Barrens?
---
After what happened yesterday, I have some things to discuss with him...
---
He skips quests too, I was actually far more disappointed in him than Asmon(who explained his position literally several times every day)
---
I'm pretty sure this was the case before Dire Maul was released too, but I do remember this argument coming up in general chat all the time with that being the popular reason given.
---
Some people are acting like this is a desperate attempt to get people to play retail. I think it's just a clever way to keep people subscribed between Classic content updates. Got level 60 and you've done the content you're interested in? Stay subscribed and come play retail and experience some stuff until the game you like has more stuff to play.
---
Can't really fault the plan, it's a good way to keep subs going for those that aren't super into disliking retail.
---
So what are they gonna do to everyone who trained their skills or did quests in higher level zones after leveling in SM? Or equipped gear that they needed those levels to wear? Are they going to take away the mounts of players who are brought from 40 back to 38? Roll back their quest progress? Unequip their gear? Derank their professions that required them to be a certain level?
---
Even if you can justify the "fairness" of trying to rollback these characters, the implications of such changes are enough to never even be considered as a realistic option. You're free to share your feedback on the subject, but I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
Why are you doing this to me?
---
"And not hurt the classic experience"
---
&gt;wouldn't mind Goblin/Worgen playable races either.
---
🙄
---
Poor quality bait bro. Trying too hard.
---
oh nice, also OP, what UI you got?
---
Just install the app and it tells me what to do?
---
You’ve no idea how good it feels to see so many comments like yours as someone who’s been complaining about WoW direction for over a decade. 
---
I mean people are free to like whatever they want and I respect people who like Retail but it feels so nice to see that many other people feel the same about Classic :)
---
1% as in several small incremental changes to a character over time as opposed to only a few large chunks of development that happen rarely.
---
You'd think context would make that apparent, but then again this is Reddit.
---
!remind me 6 hours
---
I think guild banks probably wouldn't really hurt much.
---
And it will save you a ton of money, or humiliation of begging mages for food, when paired with cooking whilst leveling up
---
I sell to vendors as AH prices on my server are in the gutter.
---
I think i'll level up before fishing, because i don't want to aggro every single area when doing it. Leveling the rest properly though.
---
The point of classic isnt to level up fast and reach the level cap, it's the journey you take to reach it. It's now how many levels you do per play session, but the achievements.
---
"Today I did three quests/reached a new Zone/am able to craft a new piece."
---
You have the modern MMO mindset still on you, which is this crappy rush-to-max games have nowadays. Enjoy the ride!
---
It's funny how quick people are to reveal their true selves the second they get the chance. You arr, in the long run, better off without these people, but it still sucks to lose friends, be betrayed, and have them turn it around on you.
---
Our guild had something of that sort go on, not to that extent, but someone was kicked for a consistent run of shitty chat and behaviour. People who chuff at rules to not be toxic/racist/shitty always reveal themselves at the slightest pushback, as if being told to not say slurs was a personal offense to them. 
---
People like that can't handle acknowledging they're just kind of shitty people. They'll say it's just a joke, or turn it around on you with really twisted malicious logic. 
---
All I can tell you is that there are good people and guilds. Good people don't out up with slurs and racism in 2019, if that offends people, fuck them to hell, they are trash people whose thoughts, opinions, and perspectives do not matter.
---
it's not challenging dropping quests in X zone to pick up quests in Y zone only to go back to X when quests in Y zone are done, but I understand you. My frustration is getting all these bs quests that say go here, go there. I have 4 breadcrumb quests telling me to go to STV, and 3 breadcrumb quests telling me to go to desolace, it's just necessary and if we are going to throw you that many breadcrumbs why do I have a 20 cap quest log. This is just my opinion and I can promise you a ton of people feel like I do. They may not vocalize it on reddit but I can assure you they exist. What difference does it make if I can hold 30 quests instead of 20? none.
---
They can't wear leather though ;)
---
They could lay you off for no reason. But if you get fired then you have a legal recourse to sue your employer if they terminate your employment without cause. Most people simply don’t know this, and employers claim to retain the right to fire anyone at any time - even making people sign a paper as a condition of employment. Fact is, it won’t hold up in court. They HAVE to have a reason, and if the court determines they don’t, you may be entitled to compensation and unemployment benefits paid for by your former employer. The problem is finding a good lawyer willing to take on a business with its own legal representation without costing a small fortune.
---
hahaha what a stupid thread. can't believe so many upvotes.
---
It’s leather
---
Imaging waiting 15 years for vanilla WoW then ruining it for yourself by power leveling to 60 with bugged dungeon grinding instead of enjoying the journey &amp; adventures in the open world
---
That’s a good vendor price
---
no wonder you cannot connect, you have no ethernet plugged in.
---
&gt;There is but one task left for you to complete. Edwin VanCleef must be assassinated. While it saddens me to condemn any man to a death sentence, it is for the greater good of the people of Westfall that VanCleef is laid to rest once and for all. Bring me the villain's head once the deed is done.

I think he's a nice enough guy, but I don't like the way he plays Classic. Whatever? He can do what he likes.

They look so happy. This is awesome

Literally knew nothing about who these people are before I clicked this (didn’t know about the bug either, which is why I clicked) and honestly couldn’t care less about the “race” to “world first”.  Ragnaros has been dead for 15 years. I’m just happy to be immersed in a world I love once again.

people tried to level as fast as possible in vanilla tho

An seeing hp of mobs

It doesn't harm me directly. It ruins the twitch streaming culture and its reputation. It's supposed to be a game sreaming service, yet it rewards people who basically are sex workers more than actual streamers who are there to be good at games.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't mind sex workers. But I don't think twitch is the place for them. Or they can make something like "[twitch.xxx](https://twitch.xxx)" specifically for this purpose (meaning there's less gaming and more boobs) while actual twitch keeps it renomé.

He was grinding zf as 5 man with 2 healers, wlock and mage, so no exp bug in zf.

They shouldn't take people away from the mainland, imo. BC's problem is it empties out Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Did someone say \[**Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker**\] ?
---
Sorry I’m out of touch, can someone explain this meme :c
---
You're on crack dude
---
Dire maul isn't even in the game yet. Get yer VC out of here.
---
I have a degree of empathy for both sides of the coin.
---
I have no desire to play BFA, so many really silly design choices.
---
On the otherhand, Classic is at heart a very very simple game. TBC really added a lot of stuff to the game - turned traditionally bad or simple classes into fully fledged playstyles (I mean Ret pally for example went from auto attack zombie to having an actual spell rotation).
---
I guess basically there is a reason WOTLK and TBC were the peak for player retention in WOW. I think many players sit somewhere between Classic and the end of WOTLK. For these players, Classic is good, but it is a bit like WOTLK/TBC lite.
---
Did somebody say ...
---
Hey wow it's the same as retail!
---
The difference comes in with PvP and Raiding. PvP is much more complex, and raiding is generally a 1 button rotation for damage classes.
---
The best thing I could do this time. Seriously, I'm 25 and sitting at 10g, with all skills learned and a new weapon I buy every 5-7lvl from the AH.

---
His current job is Online Engineer, it's possible he filled a similar role at Blizzard and his son is now filling the same role (since he mentioned they're using the same tools and systems). Online Engineers would be needed plenty in order to get a Classic server up and running.
---
Sigh...
---
I actually do think streamers influenced it.  Classic WoW pulled huge numbers on twitch, and for most of last week, virtually EVERY classic streamer above a 2k audience is spamming dungeons.  Whether you click on Asmon, Soda, Esfand, or even the Method stream, almost every streamer you see is chain-running dungeons.  Obviously they're not specifically to blame for the strat's proliferation, but there have been a LOT of eyeballs on those neverending SM runs, so I think it's safe to say that streamers played a part in the spread of this behavior.
---
And I can't believe I'm saying this, but Mcconnell is kind of carrying the torch for actually providing a good experience/stream, even if it's absolutely wacky and, at times, infantile.
---
Oh they definitely have a very good chance still. Classic raids were never difficult mechanically, it was more of a management nightmare, and they seem to know their way around it while Method &amp; co have to shift their mindset a little.
---
Plus they know all the gimmicks that allow them to do content substantially undergeared, but I suppose every serious guild can figure it out eventually.
---
Phase 4

Most people simply don’t know this, and employers claim to retain the right to fire anyone at any time - even making people sign a paper as a condition of employment.

---
I'm really curious how your UI is set up.
---
You have a dedicated window for loot/trade, the buttons are on the right, the window is quite tall and it seems to be below the action bars. There's also something I don't recognize in the bottom left. It seems very strange, I can't picture how the rest of this would work.
---
Whoops, fair point
---
&gt;People do full runs of DM too
---
Negatory. It's hell on earth to clear the entire thing; it's like twice the size of BRD. You'll be there all day.
---
Same here champ! Wont happen again, no no no no.
---
How about you let people decide for themselves if classic wow is worth their time.
---
I actually feel bad for APES. They played vanilla for years and wasted their classic relaunch experience by rushing it and bashing sand box instances.
---
Everyone can enjoy the game the way it pleases them. But in my eyes classic is all about the journey, the world and interaction with players.
---
I'm a new player and I had a guy angrily complain when I completed a quest and left, I had no idea it was common courtesy to help others finish up, all he had to do was ask nicely or tell me it was common courtesy. I only realised when another guy spent 15 minutes helping me get centaur braces after he got his, only then did it click why the other guy was angry.
---
&gt; a majority of players would agree that the toxic elitist assholes like him are what make the game unbearable

A majority of players in your bubble.

&gt;And the whole “you made a mistake, you’re an idiot” but then he makes a mistake and it’s a “game flaw” or “oh that wasn’t my fault” is just fucking laughable.  
---
And if you honestly can't tell obvious sarcasm, hyperboles and jokes from serious talk, you really should try socializing more. Picking up on social cues is something that will help you with more than watching streams later in life.
---
Does anyone know what time faerlina gets full usually in the morning? Gonna take a little nap and back at it
---
We did DM with 7 people as the whole frieds Group was online and didnt want to leave anyone behind. We had a blast, but i was wondering why we did get so much XP but i didnt know about this topic at all.
---
Yes, please roll me up to 28 :P
---
That's when you publicly shame them and add them to your Blacklist
---
Idk he started saying. there was a guild, as in past tense hence the question
---
&gt;Not worth it
---
Yes it's not worth it for the majority of people. 
---
You can do 4 ravager library and get over 50k xp/hr. 
---
You need a really well coordinated group of 10 nerds to do this. Granted you get more xp, but I did some pug 10 mans and they were hot garbage. 
---
10 mans had a lower xp floor and higher ceiling.
---
enchanting level by himself when you progress in the game, since after a certain level, you'll nearly always have green/blue items as quest rewards or dungeon
---
Travel between loch modan and westfall, you should be able to reach 17 and move to redridge to do some quests.
---
There was this awesome analogy that I heard some time ago.
---
Vanilla was like an open safari. You arrive and a guy tells you that game is that way. The you go and make your own adventure.
---
Retail is a like a Disney theme park. It's flashy and colourful, but everything is railroaded and when taking a ride you have to keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times.
---
&gt;Unoptimised 5 man dungeons in beta were doing 50-60xp/hr grinding SM.
---
&gt;&gt;my guild had 100k/h
---
You literally replied to a comment about SM. ZF and LBRS are irrelevant.
---
What about farming SM is bad? It's good exp and grouping with players is fun
---
Yep, you are correct :D went from 4g to 2g on my druid at 20.
---
The Orc racial isn't 5% crit, mate, it's 5 weapon skill.
---
Weapon skill is basically related to hitting enemies, not really how hard you hit them. When leveling it's not very significant.
---
I see. well, true I guess.
---
No, power warf shield can’t be cast on anyone but you and the members of your party.
---
Damaging your reputation for a few Woolen Bags. Yikes.
---
Kurinnaxx squad! There's a gnome only one going around too.
---
Classic is the grind, embrace it. "But other people are stronger than me" QQ that's life!
---
The absolute best beneficial thing about specifically late night fishing has one word: nightfin soup. That shit is everything your casters ever wanted, especially healers.
---
So many neckbeard weirdos in this post holy shit lmao.
---
due to lack of ranged weapon (wand) and them running out of mana you only really had one moonkin in a raid and he was just there for the crit buff he provides and to act as a mana tank (innervate) for the healers
---
This is probably as good as it gets:
---
/castsequence Frost Armor, Arcane Intellect
---
And you have to press the key twice
---
Just bought 1 month game time. İ am creating character right now :) İ hope i wont regret it. Thanks.
---
yes it is. I have the same playtime than you and it's enough to gain at least one level here and there. I think playing vanilla as a casual is much better and fun than powerleveling it with super long sessions
---
My friends and I have been doing it right. Screw those big streamers that have lost touch, vanilla wow was a time before streamers and that's how I'd like to relive it haha
---
Welcome to twitch culture, where you spend your day not playing the game you like but obsess over a random person on the internet streaming their lives. Side effect of the internet I guess.
---
Well imagine you need 12 and he needs 12 lets suppose it's a 100% drop.
---
So two people should be killing 2 mobs faster then 1 person killing 1 mob.
---
What i mean you 2 should be able to kill 24 mobs faster, then alone 12.  
---
Also you get more then 50% mob xp so thats also a nice bonus.
---
He's actually a PhD in bags
---
That's the reason I've not watched any streamers levelling in dungeons. When Asmon finally did some quests and eventually got ganked it was far more entertaining than AoE grinding in ZF.
---
My biggest problem was that I couldn't do enough solo as a miner. Sitting in 0.0 in an Itty with a single mining laser sucking on Veldspar. Doing trade runs was also tedious.
---
And the fact maintenance always fell on my lunch break.
---
We had this drop in one of our runs, our rogue was allowed to need and use it.
---
I’d also add punkrat to this list, although he’s very different
---
I've talked with a GM who told me this is to emulate how Vanilla was back then.
---
You can thank the \#nochanges!1!1 community for this and other things that make the game old and barely playable (e.g. No dual spec). Cannot lol enough seeing these trihards got beaten at their own game by a guild named APES.
---
so should i start using shields at 40?
---
Not even that - you’re given extra xp.
---
So what you're saying is everything should be given to you or boohoo it's too hard. This attitude where "difficult = not fun"
---
is what destroyed wow. Though I doubt someone like you would know anything about it and that's fine, blizzard needs suckers to pay for their mistakes.
---
Only by abusing layering, and having practiced it on pservers who knows how many times. 
---
It comes down to game design, and how back in 2004 the leveling experience was part of the game. In BfA, it's just a means to getting to the actual game. Not that it's a bad thing, you have to accelerate the leveling speed when you have a Max level that high, otherwise it'd take.literal years to reach it.
---
I'm not sure what you mean? Are you implying they never mentioned anyone else? They talked about Apes, Joker, Journey and several other participants in the race plenty of times.
---
Yeah only a few of my recipes are selling for anything near decent.  Still like 1/10 of what they should be.  Alas.  It’s an investment.
---
The people you liked are dickheads and that's just how life is sometimes.
---
Jump on your server discord and find some new people, all of my friends can't play the game and don't have time due to other commitments and yet I've found a bunch of really cool people to play with. 
---
So, as it seems a sense of community is what you require most from this game go and find it, I guarantee you it's out there.
---
Theres also way more that needs to be said. And that's why the hell this story is so 1 sided
---
Idk why this gives you a reason to play classic. It will take you longer to level from 20 to 60 in classic than it would te level the character you want from 1-110 in retail
---
There's also the factor of cast time. Most of the lower ranks have a shorter casting time (looking at you, Healing Touch...)
---
First i did not ,call anyone a scum :) 2nd F u
---
You will need 3 others people, the only way to beat dungeons as a team of two is being overleveled with a extremely good gear and very very very good players
---
Brilliant. If everyone could do it they would so no guilt. As long as you try and evasion tank no one can hold it against you. 
---
And to be fair, vanish didn't work correctly for so many patches, I think we're still being paid back for that....
---
Ah, 4 warriors one shaman served us well in library
---
If it wasn't for being ganked, I wouldn't pick pvp. I like to live dangerously.
---
Because ots not a nerf , they are foxing a bug/exploit
---
Just fishing 5 points every level is enough to keep you current. Just stop whenever you see a school of fish or something. :)
---
Probably a good chance later on before phase 2 if Classic keeps being popular.
---
It was called vc on some north American servers. This never caught on in the eu or rest of the world.
---
You need to grind between quests anyways unleas you change to similar zones frequently a boat ride away.
---
So it doesn't really matter that you duo and you kill twice as quick.
---
Is there a way to make Battle.net work like Steam when opening games from a desktop shortcut?
---
* **Default:** Double Click on WoW shortcut &gt; Battle.net opens (auto-login) &gt; Click PLAY button &gt; Game launches
---
* **What I want:** Double Click on WoW shortcut &gt; Battle.net opens (auto-login) &gt; Game launches
---
I told my friends who were really excited for this release "it's going to suck. It's just strictly a nostalgia fest. People will very quickly realize it sucks and it'll die". I was very wrong and am now addicted and hoping everyone else stays addicted for as long as i do
---
That's so nice. I'm trying to level all my professions too as I level. What level are you at?
---
As a lv30 Warlock drain tank, which pet should I use?
---
I used a succubus until now
---
Are the paladin/warlock mount quests in phase one?
---
Meanwhile I had like 50 awesome PvP fights with same level hordes, their loss.
---
Yall are on the first stage of the Asmongold syndrome
---
It's recommended to spec prot to tank between 40 and 50. Nearly required 50 to 60. You'll need a shield.
---
OK, let's say a level 40,or 50 or hell 60, who now currently have nothing to do but to kill other players, such as the low level scrubs on a PvP realm and they happen to find you, Would killing you, not affect your experience?
---
Leveling and gearing is an arms race on PvP, highest and most gears wins, with 10 players running a dungeon designed for 5 players, would it get done faster and therefore allowing more dungeon runs? Therefore more gear?
---
Wait, better and more easy question, kill 20 boars you alone and two other players who are grouped, who is going to kill all 20 boars the fastest?
---
r u a wizard?
---
Uh oh but I thought muh classic community doesn't have raider.io, logs and only meta picks for groups!!
---
I'm just chuckling at remembering people on this sub saying that streamers getting into beta ahead of others was good because they'd report bugs and bring them to the devs attention.
---
Turns out they're just like the rest of the scabs who'll unapologetically abuse any bug they can until Blizzard fix it.
---
Classic is capped at 60. Only possible solution would be for retail characters.
---
Rant start:
---
Honestly i don't watch streamers an i was suprised that there was many people that already reached 60. I don't actually care about that they made a raid and farmed xp throught that seems legit to me. I just hate those hardcore classic people that want to tell you how to level how to behave and so on. 
---
Yesterday i had a group to go dungeon after that i thanked them and left. One wispered me if i wasn't gonna stay in group or if I have no intrest in adding them to friends. I was really polite in my answere but in my head i was like wtf dude i don't add every person that does a dungeon with me to my friendslist that is for friends. For someone that gone through shit with me not for a person i just meet because i want the loot of a dungeon.
---
Also that asmond... streamer man i have no words for that person and his personality...
---
Rent end.
---
Blizzard is responsible for every mechanic in the game if there is such a mechanic like raiding for exp then thats not the fault of the player.
---
Is that the equivalent of Kardashian dudes for Azeroth?
---
You are 100 % right.
---
That being said, caring this much about some losers streamers is pathetic. Get a life
---
Axe talents in arms tree 5% crit
---
Ill explain one time. I asked what is supposed to mean and the guy ansering said its that he is just a troll and doest take anything serious. That was his argument for the "Anyone that thought highly of Asmon is delusional". I just dont see how being a troll is relevant to this, and why that upsets people. So no, i didnt argue againts points he never made...
---
That was a lie on their part.
---
I don’t think ~~Blizzard~~ the WoW Classic dev team deserve this much vitriol after all they have done to get this game going.
---
Lmao as an outsider looking in this is sad as fuck, you guys realise this is just a game right?
---
Same on US-Proudmoore
---
Why in the world do people keep taking pictures of their screens with their phones? You can just press one key, open the browser and post it.
---
You must be really stupid then because leveling to 60 in classic takes a lot longer than to 110 in retail. If you dont care about classic i dont know why this would make you care.
---
Obviously fake lol.
---
you will be bored to death. Doing quick sessions of fishings (like fishing 10/15 time) between quests or waiting for a repop/heartstone/etc is the best way to improve fishing
---
Be the group you'd want to see in the World (of Warcraft)
---
We’ve got one on Deviate Delight to. Also rppvp
---
Because of queues
---
I tried to do this yesterday and it was not possible, i still was in combat. And in another instance, when i FD-ed gorilla continued to attack me /shrug
---
&gt; They are the number one guild on retail with 100+ world first. Doesn't make sense to not participate in this world first.
---
Well they knew they are not going to win it. They are good at finding strategies for new raids that come out but they might not be good enough to clear instance faster than teams who have done it several years in private servers.
---
also Vol'jin
---
And also with only 1 person you need to eat sometimes to recover hp, while with 2 persons you kill mobs faster so less recover time
---
This offer is for people like me. Who played through Classic and TBC and got lost within one of the further addons. I haven’t touched WoW since trying it a month at Cataclysm, and It just couldn‘t catch up to everything befor. 
---
Now after years I am
---
Back playing classic and I am back in love. 
---
Would I try BFA if I got it for free? sure! Would It make me maybe buy further expensions? Actually maybe it does. 
---
I would not touch WoW again if there wasn‘t classic, therefor this offers them a rar opportunity to promote the game again to a special audience.
---
Not sure what you use - I have a Mac and I’m able to launch Wow directly from the finder bar, without battlenet even launching.
---
Why do people give streamers free shit? Really, why? It's really culty and weird to me.
---
This is my experience so far on a pvp realm. Ive always played pve since launch in 2004 and frankly it get irritating. Hell same faction people just run away, the fuck is that!
---
I guess its the hype train, i hope it get better in a few weeks.
---
and we know nagas like to steal stuff from other races
---
Exactly. I find it ironic that people complain how others play the game a certain way while arguing that the game should be played in **their** certain way.
---
If anything, I find this to be perfectly in line with the vanilla experience, big guilds are doing big guild stuff, meanwhile I'm worrying over how I'm gonna be able to afford my mount by level 40.
---
Fishing is a huge waste of time, but cooking takes almost zero time, you will find most ingredients you need to level up organically in all the zones, and it gives you free health and hp/mana reg buffs while you're leveling.
---
I don't get why people bitch about how other people play the game. Be a better player yourself then, be the change you want to see and don't spread this senseless hate.
---
I'm not a fan of Asmon but who am I to judge how other people play the game we all love to play.
---
Nothin humiliating about asking for help lol. But yeah, it's not coincidential that cooking, fishing and first aid are secondary profs, everyone should have those
---
What are some pre-60 Hunter gear sets? For example: Scarlet set that is mail is typically for Warriors/Paladins.
---
Try with the horde felhunter quest...
---
Undercity, rathed (barrens), undercity, thousand needles, hillsbrad, undercity, desolace, undercity... Like wtf
---
During original classic trump wasn't the president and there was no Brexit, blizzard really fucked up with that and didn't provide the original classic experience
---
Well done OP I am jelous.
---
Okey, so what it boils down to is that people should adjust their playstyle to the way you prefer them to play. And streamers should do what you prefer them to do?
---
Paladins could make good use of that as well.
---
Cooking is driving me crazy right now, I'm at like 30 and haven't found any good recipes to get me over the hump.
---
I remember back in the day I completely ignored fishing all the way to 70, then I wanted to be able to fish up the boss in SSC and cook the best food so I could be useful and grinding from 1 to 500 or whatever was so mind numbing.
---
Half the raid would be playing that shit while the leader goes over the fight for the nubs.
---
#whocares
---
I can't speak for streamers but you're doing the same mindless grind for a dozen levels instead of experiencing the game the way it was meant to be played - quests, different zones, interacting with the other faction. Of course there are people that have already done it all or have other priorities in mind, and more power to them, but for most players going that route would be cheating yourself out of the fun.
---
It doesn't bother them that's the answer you're looking for that you choose not to accept.
---
I like to do this with my owl and eyes of the beast, the wings flapping makes it pretty much impossible for my buddies to click on it
---
Do you want me to send you my feces per mail? Completely free? I even pay for shipping myself? Not everything that is free is automatically good
---
The server checks if you stopped moving every 0.5 seconds, that means that if you stopped moving rightafter the server checked, you will need to wait 0.5 seconds before starting the swing animation.
---
How is time relevant?  He's not a thot showing off cleavage.
---
Howdy guys. I'm on Ashkandi Horde and I'm an altoholic. I can do any role and just want some cool people to play with

---
https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/
---
You will be surprised. This survey with 18000 particpants shows the biggest age group to be 25-35, followed by 18-24 and only 1,7% are under 18. This is not the demographic you would be expecting in a game like Fortnite or social media like TikTok. 
---
WoW is just another demographic.
---
Did you try the guides on icy-veins?
---
I realised there was more to you question and edited my original response. I hope that fully answers your questions
---
If you’re starting fresh leveling cooking and fishing alongside each other. Make sure you buy the recipes for brilliant small fish, longjaw mud snapper, and bristlewhisker catfish. These 3 recipes will carry your cooking past 100 with only things you’ve caught.
---
I thought the ilevel increased all stats on the item, inclusive of the proc, so a 445 mythic and an LFR titanforged to 445 would look identical?
---
Oh so for a certain time people could boost super fast through sm?
---
You are assuming he doesn't blow it.
---
Oh shit you made me realize I'm a 10 year vet
---
Is there a difference in a community though? Or it doesn't matter and I'm gonna have the same experience no matter the server?
---
The 5 hour queue is 100% on you. I understand that your friends want to stay and thats fine, but their refusal to move is not a reflection of the game. It sounds like the majority of your issue comes from needing fast and satisfying gameplay to make up for the wait time, right? Switch servers man. The sooner the better. I’m currently on “second choice” Sulfuras. Longest queue I’ve seen during high time was 30min. All other times are instant log ins.
---
I have no idea who the vast majority of streamers are. I go through great lengths to make sure of that. This person is no exception. I'm going to assume it's safe to say that this person doesn't say or do anything particularly interesting. I think you're lending him far too much acknowledgement with a post like this. With that being said, they're not the first person to rush to endgame. They're not the first person to succeed off the backs of other players. It wasn't reasonable to expect that not a single person going into Classic without a "tryhard" mindset. There were people who played vanilla with the sole intention of rushing to level 60 and becoming the first people to beat the raids. That's just how it is.
---
Who the fuck levels a shadow priest without mindflay? O.o
---
Skinning is good for levelling as it provides quick easy cash. Engineering is pretty great for pvp and pve so if you want a more useful profession I’d go with that. It can be expensive to level though
---
If you aggro a mob, run to the tank, not away from the tank.
---
As a DPS with some lockdown, keep an eye on the healer, and be ready to CC should he pull aggro.
---
Healers need to respect tanks getting initial aggro too (vs multiple mobs in particular), thus has to be mindful about pre-hots and when to start healing. 
---
In a similar fashion, the tank makes his own job easier by healing up before pulling, not after.
---
What UI are you using that changes the font like that?
---
They were downed by people playing since years if not decades on private servers and who used a bug to level up faster. They have nothing in common with the average player.
---
Thank god for this nerf though. Not the classic experience I wanted tbh
---
Plus Quel'danas was the closest thing to old school Southshore/Tarren Mill or BRD world pvp.
---
I wasn't ever much of a fan of the quests but man I loved hanging out on that island
---
Question: What is the purpose of all the Shots macros? (Arcane Shot, Multi shot, stings, ...)  
---
Genuinely curious
---
How dare you being reasonable?
---
Yes, you have to run from there. Theres a few flight paths you can grab along the way. Look for a flight path picture on google before you set off.
---
So you did not enjoy what ? That u have more life responsibilities now ?
---
Haha! That is the best... When you click a talent upgrade and you still have one left!? Uhhwee
---
Literally couldn't give less of a shit
---
I don't care? It would be down by now anyways.
---
Same.
---
I thought about it once because I couldn't find a friend in game. Then I realized I'm retarded and I was just looking in the wrong spot.
---
Yah, it is...  You could very easily live off the interest of that.
---
&gt; Almost as if Vanilla WoW actually had a terrible leveling experience
---
In your opinion. Many of us love it.
---
Judging by the way you formulated the post and your comments ø- stay away.
---
Zug Zug is the only way.
---
Oopsie
---
Oh fuck off, you sound like a soccer mom who thinks video games are bad and make kids violent.  People are responsible for their own behavior and actions.
---
This guy has a couple deep dives for warrs and a priest deep dive with shitloads of details;

https://youtu.be/faV-uY7ZYrE
---
Also second icy veins.
---
And now you're 15
---
Uh, you do realize that with the amount of viewers Asmon has he wouldn't just be a little outnumbered, he'd be crushed by a literal army at every chance. There's no skill in the world that can help him in that situation.
---
So why is this so expensive? Beginner here
---
To be honest this is quite cool. Thanks Blizz
---
In vanilla, it took me about 2 RL weeks to hit 60, with something like 9 days played time (more than twice of what it takes now). Then I spent another 200 days /played time *at* level 60. Say what you want about leveling too fast or whatever, but for some people it's about the level 60 stuff, not the 1-59 stuff.
---
I do this. Especially to warriors that aggro lots of mobs.  
---
so hilarious to watch them die.
---
I am currently levelling my hunter and trying to plan ahead. What should I be doing for the next 30 levels to try and make enough gold to be able to get a mount at 40?
---
They pretend that if that happened in vanila - no one would go to sm10 to get xp and gear
---
Haha, you're welcome 😂
---
The mount is 40g right?
---
INB4: "Dinners ready" / "I need you to go to the store, asap" / "You promised to..."
---
Trololol
---
I do. What does it do my wand doesnt?
---
The reason you have to press it twice is because each spell invokes the global cooldown (GCD) and you can’t cast another spell until that’s finished.
---
The /castsequence command will cast the next spell in the sequence each time you press your button.
---
Spells marked “instant” do not invoke the GCD and can be cast at the same time with other spells in a macro like this:
---
/cast Presence of Mind
---
/cast Pyroblast
---
While I get this is only one side of the story, it is a very convincing side that unfortunately your friends are horrific inderviduals.
---
I am sorry you went through that. Just remember it is Day 7, people will not remember these smears very sion, and you can rebuild.
---
Good luck.
---
There really aren't any pre 60. The scarlet set is just a think. Focus on using what you can but focus on the following stats in this order agi, stam, int.
---
HA, thats what I love, I'm no longer an avatar of azeroth that can chew through demons like no tomorrow. I'm just some tauren that has trouble trying to kill a few gnolls.
---
" most booring games i've yet to play " so not even played it and your bagging on it
---
Good on them for upholding the spirit and integrity of the game
---
yeah but then you arent doing your faction proud
---
I'd say if they start bothering you, report away.
---
I've hade someone called "superturbofister" or something? Rolling need on EVERYTHING in the dungeon. Only to go "oops sorry didn't notice" when being called for it. He then just didn't roll for 2 drops, and then started rolling need again.
---
I reported him for not having an appropriate RP name.
---
Well. If Blizzard would care then we’d see some bans for at least layer hopping. How it’s not counted as an exploit even?
---
Lets pull your head out of your streamer-hating ass for 5 seconds shall we.
---
'.. Only to beg for gold and items from other players after saying they strictly wouldn't.'
---
People did this in vanilla actually. Especially in main towns.
---
'...Only to spam Scarlet Monastery to level.'
---
People also did this because SM is really fucking good exp, and has some of the strongest drops for people for a long while.
---
'...Only to beg for gold for your first mount when you said you wouldn't'
---
People did this all of the time too. A lot of people got their first mount from asking friends and such for help and paying them back later.
---
'...Only to say " CAN I GET THAT? " whenever an item drops.'
---
Asking if you can need on an item is again, a very core concept in vanilla, it's upto the others on whether they decide to pass or roll. 
---
'...Only to say " I don't want to do that quest it doesn't give good enough loot "'
---
People would skip quests all the time if they weren't worthwhile, there's no reason not to. Even then, why does someone skipping some quests affect you in any way, shape or form?
---
'...Only to do the same exact things and behave the same way you do on retail'
---
Go figure that WoW isn't as different as you think it was back then, just that you were younger, and focused more on just playing the game with friends rather than spending time getting angry over dumb shit. 
---
The only people failing classic are the people getting so worked up on what other people do rather than focusing on their own experience. Do I dislike how people who religiously follow streamers act? God yes. But the people so religiously against it are just about, if not more so, obnoxious.
---
Did you google before posting here? A ton of guides are out there, obviously.
---
Tailor + Ench is very straight forward. Just use all the cloth you get to make items that you can DE and level up your enchanting. While leveling I am able to keep both professions "maxed" out to my level just by looting cloth.
---
I haven't watched his stream. Everything I've seen has been text.
---
i had a lot more on my mind.
---
It wouldn't be classic without ranting about exploiters. XD.
---
They thought they wont, but they did.
---
There’s also a “Tauren only” guild on DD, though I’ve seen plenty of non-Tauren in it
---
Thanks a lot.
---
Are you on ashbringer EU by any chance? I think I recognize the guild name!
---
He also did that to a twitch subscriber.
---
Was around 7 dollars and he proper bitched about it.
---
What level are you now?
---
heads up, people have been getting banned for this.
---
Someone in this sub said that if you increase your fishing skill by 6 every lvl after 10 then you will have 300 skill when you reach lvl 60. Great way to spread it out so it doesn't feel like it takes to much of your time
---
As much as I share the sentiment -- the change to let 10 people enter instance was added after the beta oficially closed. 
---
Beta instances were limited to usual group of 5.
---
Same. I never waited a minute. And there is more than enough players on the server.
---
If you use it with a orbWeaver you won't have to touch your keyboard again
---
My alt will be on an RP server. Is there pvp enabled on those, though?

&gt; Frankly all I saw ppl gathering around to kill a monster then say thanks and leaves.  
---
You need to find the good peoples. I had a lot of fun meeting players, questing together, then trading some goods/items, and keeping contact time to time
---
???????? you loser lmao go play the game tf you crying about
---
Yeah I leveled up and forgot to spend the point
---
Sorry, I meant southshore.
---
Yes you basically run all the way from wetlands if I remember correctly. Be careful in arathi tho
---
40 - 30 = 10
---
&gt; the simplification of the talent trees at MoP (as well as just less time to play post college).
---
meh. AT MAX LEVEL, the talent trees are functionally no different. You pick a few talents that matter and a bunch of filler. The fact that you have to click some talents 5 times, and that you have to click some talents before other talents doesn't make them more complex. in both cases your choices are cookie cutter--all talent trees will always be, forever. 
---
WHILE LEVELING, the old talent system is better because it feeds into the gradual sense of evolving your character in a far more satisfying way than the new one.
---
Level 10 just now, currently using skinning and leather working.
---
I play on pve ru realm. No queues since day 2, when I rolled there.
---
One guild has cleared MC. Is one guild the majority of Classic's player base?
---
Come to my server. We'll be friends.  PM if you're interested.
---
I played Vanilla and loved it, but part of that experience was seeing SW for the first time, running DM for this first time, etc.  Doing that again in Classic won’t be the same for people who played Vanilla, as such I won’t be investing huge amounts of time into Classic.

Yeah, Wrath was when it started getting worse. Specifically with the Crusade and their stupid jousting dailies
---
Hells yeah he is. I watched him for hours yesterday just chillin' and fishin'. And then there was this:  [https://www.twitch.tv/madseasonshow/clip/ExpensiveLovelyHorseradishRitzMitz](https://www.twitch.tv/madseasonshow/clip/ExpensiveLovelyHorseradishRitzMitz)

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cymwl4/my_new_weapon_makes_enemies_quiver_in_fear/). 
---
I cant remember but you can just turn pet skills off so dont worry about it
---
hmm thats weird, but thanks
---
Wetlands or duskwood would be the main choices
---
Of course I did. I am considering to sell everything, not leveling Enchanting
---
Haven't seen so much nonsense in one text.
---
I mean that you would move the character from classic to retail in that case.
---
Maybe it was for the best. Causing yourself misery Is not worth it just for playing a video game. It was shit what happened but people are shitty and stupid nothing will change that. Except how you deal with it.
---
Most likely addon issue ..
---
You are seeing this issue because you know the map and the zone levels.  The breadcrumbs are designed to lead you to new areas to explore as you outlevel your zone.  If you don't need them, don't pick them up.  But new players- and we were all new when this was designed NEED these to help guide them to the right zones.  remember it's classic and was designed for a diff player base than today's wow
---
&gt;I always enjoyed fishing, 
---
How?  It's fucking horrible in this game...
---
Often it bites us in the ass when people keep running and you're stuck there tanking 2 mobs. Doesn't matter, it's our duty
---
Where do I get first aid past 150?
---
What is does the guy say at the end to make them cheer?
---
I would suggest choosing one of the servers that came out a bit later so the server is not full with tryhards.
---
You did, I'm sure my equivalent is orgrimar. 
---
This game is dope
---
I must be weird, but I don't really care how Asmongold plays WoW Classic.
---
Good to know that thanks
---
I might bring WoW to work on a flash drive tomorrow..
---
Well if you are pulling aggro from threat then you need to do something to reduce your threat output. I'm no master of classic, but I suppose it makes sense theoretically. However you're maybe thinking of a few other things.
---
For example rogues will likely only use instant poison (not wound or deadly) and will not use bleeds in raids because enemies can only have a limited number of debuffs (16 I think). So deadly poison may increase dps, but not if it replaces the armor reduction debuff, losing the entire raid damage.
---
Also for horde I think windfury totem takes up the same "enchant slot" as poison. So they don't use a poison on main hand if they have a shaman using WF totem in their party. Daggers rogues might since they hit faster and weaker, but not sure.
---
*streamer privilege*
---
Every time you enter a dungeon/raid, an instance is created. I would be very surprised if they didn't keep some logs of this. If they have done their job right (which very likely they did, it is the modern engine after all), it should be fairly trivial to find all players who have been in a raid group inside a 5 man dungeon at least 10 times.
---
They are gathering these kinds of statistics all the time for balance, tracking and anti-cheat purposes. How many people are doing dungeons? How far do groups get on average? How does that correlate with the classes in groups? which bosses kill more or less players than expected? etc etc. Pretty much everything you do is logged and processed at least to some degree, and certainly aggregated into bigger statistical analyses.
---
So yeah, they can easily take action and roll back. Maybe not even roll back, but lock those people out for a week. That'll negate their advantage without too many side effects. It's not like those big guilds/streamers won't just play on another account for that time.
---
He is the reflection of the community. Not less not more.
---
You can learn it with leatherworking, if you get stuff like that drop later I'd recommend putting it on the AH. At this point I'd probably vendor it is as most people have no currency for things like that
---
As someone who hasn't played retail since TBC, what did they change? I cannot see WoW without its talent trees, so I'm curious as to how it works now.
---
I've tried selling some leather on the AH but it is spammed with people throwing in single leather pieces and it makes it impossible to sell bundles even if they're priced the same.
---
So yeah, I just vendor it.  It's easy money considering the amount of beasts you kill for quests.
---
Imma check this out
---
now THAT's a cool world first, not MC and Oni
---
When I fish I keep the ones that can lvl the cooking and either feed the rest to the pet or dump it if I lack space
---
What you experienced then, teens and young adults will experience now. Life changes, 15 years is a long time. You're a vet, experience it in your own time, family is more important :).
---
&gt;Probably some kind of redundancy in their actual server machines. Still, I don't know if they can just load any update on the fly now.
---
Most likely the server software dynamically loads the server logic during runtime. If they want to update it on the fly they issue a command to load the new logic, replace the old one with the new, unload the old. They probably have all the key elements separated into nice packages to make it quicker by replacing only a small amount. All the other subsystems keep running while doing it so you wouldn't notice it.
---
I'm also supposed to eat healthy and exercise, I don't do those either. :p
---
lv18 rogue 23h
---
but I also did up my gathering proffs cooking FA and fishing to 100+
---
What other add-ons are you using?
---
The only way I see more people getting it is Blizzard changes the mats so people cant hoard them in advance. This may give people extra lockouts needsd...
---
TLDR you are a few degrees of separation from a lot of toxic fucks... Not my problem as I dont associate with such people or anyone near them. You are probably better off now
---
Not sure about that. It looks to me that retail is killing classic for good
---
... It's called thousand needles because of the rocks coming out of the ground... I'm an idiot
---
Ah no astral power in classic yea? Might of been a wrath or cata thing though I didn't start playing druid till WoD
---
No flying!
---
Was gonna write up the whole way to do this and get more xp pr hour than solo, but such a hassle. Tldr: just kill stuff twice as fast as solo.
---
&gt; you
---
yeagh and i even had dagger, what a troll
---
Thanks very much! Maybe soon I can head over to Westfall and visit the humans there. :)
---
Someone was aoe farming.
---
One of the perks of being Forsaken, I can snack on my friend before I ress him. Saves so much on food.
---
what exactly it will need, myself will not open dungeon maps module no matter what
---
Stitches!
---
This gonna be a hard no from me. People doing selfish shit like this is one of the reasons the queues are so long.
---
Me too, and it is not so bad I find for solo plsy. I can handle two mobs just fine. I also find people are happy to group up for kill quests when they know that I will tank the mobs.
---
I feel like this should be a DramaTime submission.

---
#####Newly formed guild recruiting players of all skill levels interested in a casual raiding experience and having friendly people to play Classic with.
---
***
---
&amp;nbsp;    
---
**&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** is a North American based Alliance casual raiding guild occupying the Pagle (PvE) server. As a guild, we look to maintain a focus on understanding and supporting your guild mates as we all traverse Classic raiding together.&amp;nbsp;    
---
Some of us are experiencing vanilla World of Warcraft for the first time and want to see what the raiding scene was like back in 2004, without [Dives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvIYRrgZ04) hounding us for moar dots. We're not looking to be server first, but we are here to make progress (and gaming buddies!).&amp;nbsp;    
---
If this type of raiding experience sounds like something you might be interested in, we have some more information below, as well as a link to our [application](https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnDRnPgowE?i=R405lvVd). Thanks!&amp;nbsp;    
---
#☄️ What we look for in members ☄️
---
* Mature individuals who are willing to be kind and understanding of each other in order to create a comfortable guild environment.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Players who are looking to clear raid content, but don't want to push themselves for server first.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Social members who are ready to hang out and run some dungeons or chill out on the Minecraft server. We want Classic to be what we all have in common, but make friends for other games here too!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Members that will be proud to be a part of **&lt;The Winged Expanse&gt;** and care about the reputation of the guild they belong to.
---
#📜 Requirements and Rules 📜
---
* You are required to listen in on Discord during raid time. We also ask that you have a functioning microphone and that you either use a well configured noise gate or use Push-to-Talk instead.&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Show up to raid with a good attitude. This includes patience for newer vanilla players and a strong willingness to learn!&amp;nbsp;    
---
* Be kind to those around you, both in and out of the guild. We care about our reputation as a guild, and we expect you to as well!
---
#📅 Guild Events 📅
---
**Post Launch:** At the current moment, we're all just trying to have fun and hit level 60 together. The plans for raiding are laid out down below. More specific information will be available closer to our first raid night.
---
#⚔️ [Raiding](https://www.guilded.gg/The-Winged-Expanse/games/WowClassic/docs/1569043501) ⚔️
---
**Raid nights are every Tuesday and Thursday, 9:00pm - 12:00am Eastern Standard Time (EST).**&amp;nbsp;    
---
Raiding begins November 12th (we will re-evalute as necessary). Members are expected to have reached level 60, acquired adequate raiding gear, completed the required attunement, and be versed in raid mechanics by this time. This should give members enough time to enjoy the content before you have to be raid ready.&amp;nbsp;    
---
We don't expect everyone to have perfect attendance; Life comes first. That being said, we really appreciate a heads up when possible, and we do expect you to be present more often than not both physically and mentally.&amp;nbsp;    
---
**We're looking for people to play roles, not classes! Play whatever class you believe you will have the most fun playing! Roles are first come, first serve as we establish the guild. We are currently recruiting all positions and classes __besides tanking__.**&amp;nbsp;    
---
For raid composition, we're aiming for a Main Tank, an Offensive Tank, 2 Alternate Tanks, 8 Healers, 14 Melee Damage, and 14 Ranged Damage. Roles will be assigned as you join the guild so that we know what we are looking for as we continue to recruit.&amp;nbsp;    
---
The loot system is a rotating loot council comprised of the Guild Master, a selection of two random officers, and two random guild members. The piece will be awarded to the guild member who the council believes will make the biggest impact on our progression. Be ready to put the guild before your ego! You will get pieces, I promise.
---
That about sums it up! Below is a link to our application, again. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this post, message me, or find me on Discord at **Marotheit#7401**. We hope to see you soon!&amp;nbsp;    
---
**Our Application:** https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnDRnPgowE?i=R405lvVd
---
To each his own.
---
If you are DPS: try to stay within line of sight to your healer. The healer will prioritize the tank first and foremost, and will probably not chase you around too much to keep you alive.
---
I'm a paladin, so have limited options of spells when healing. "Group healing" is me throwing flash of light around - don't make it too hard for me as I really need to position myself to make sure the tank can always be healed.
---
Not the guy you asked but I believe it depends on the context of the word. If used to insult then it shouldn't be allowed, however if for example it's casually or jokingly said then I don't really have a problem with it - Is Dave Chapelle racist for using it in his latest comedy special?
---
HOWEVER as OP was the GM then they his rules, though I think a warning not to use that word would've sufficed and if they kept saying it a kick would be warranted.
---
Can't argue with the kodo logic
---
Or its because it was :checks notes: a fad.
---
I know there won’t be much option at my current level, but just wanting to know how best to use my next 30 levels
---
Ah yeah I see. I fly around a lot now in BFA, really makes it fun for me. But I understand liking to see everyone around in one area doing stuff. I’m still “up in the air” on whether or not to play classic. I’m new to WoW and still enjoying everything about the endgame! And because I never had a “classic” experience 15 yrs ago, everything about the retail WoW is classic to me at the moment.
---
and a dwarf smelling the air
---
If they werent that expensive and if trump wouldnt get all the money from the sale, I'd also want one just to annoy people. 
---
Not saying he isnt an actually supporter, but some people just love to troll  and piss people off
---
I never cared for "experiencing 1-60", not in 2005, not in 2019.  
---
Doing things like this is my "classic experience".
---
I've always got my rod on me so if I'm waiting for someone to travel to me or for my hearth cool down for example, I can fish
---
I think that’s just an inevitable reality that comes from experience and has nothing to do with streamers. Humans are just naturally prone to optimization and efficiency. Regardless of the circumstances people will try to find the best way to do things.
---
Hell by the time BC was ending that was the norm as well. It was a very similar game at that point, and yet people had long lists of requirements to join their groups and AoEing your way through dungeons was normal. Hell private servers have been this way for years since they first started popping up. 
---
I don’t think what you were expecting was ever going to be the reality of a classic remake. Regardless of streamers existing or not.
---
Healing output over target head, is that possible without an addon? And if not, what addon could do this?
---
yeah you couldnt hit a 30, dont think they have ever played before...
---
A few people will downvote him for not liking "classic experience". Not liking it is normal, MMORPGs changed a lot since(but i'm not sure if it's right to call them MMO instead of semi-session or something).
---
But mixing together technical issues(queues) and gameplay is the reason he's downvoted.
---
No server lag issues i was playing at 5am, and I'm on a server with very little or no queue times, everything happens quickly.  I did disable addons and it still occurs.
---
Yeah no, i would have also instantly gkicked such people, the mistake he made was playing with his IRL friends who associate with such trash. It's a lot easier to kick dickheads when you have no prior relation
---
Oh damn... And with mounts having a 5sec cast(?) Could be wrong. Starting to seem not worth... For now of course I'll always get my mount because why not :)
---
Personally for Me, when I do put stuff on for cheaper than vendor price, there's a) a buyout that's above vendor price, b) a chance bidding will drive it beyond vendo price, and c) it's nice to know even if you don't sell it at vendor price there's a good chance a player is putting it to good use rather than it disappearing into the void
---
Imagine thinking you need a sword and shield to tank in classic.
---
He mentioned it during the stream after the Rag/Not kill, so after the race was won.
---
THANK YOU
---
Asmongold is an ass wipe, I watched him yesterday and gagged at how dependent he is on other players to get anywhere
---
You're moving the goal post
---
"the average person is retarded" is a given, it has nothing to do with the actual difficulty of the fights, of course a mouthbreathing LFR player will struggle in anything remotely hard, but if you put them in MC or anything that's not Naxx or possibly AQ40, they'll do better than they would in a NORMAL Palace run
---
Vanilla raiding is a complete joke, even ignoring the obvious bait that is "MC died in a day" (seriously, of course it did, they've been doing the same shit for 5+ years on Private servers), no one is playing Classic for raiding, or at least I sure as fuck hope not,  LFR only hurt the low to mid-core guilds that needed the fresh blood to teach and help, the average playerbase is significantly better than they were in Vanilla, even if they still are braindead most of the time
---
I doubt the people that regularly partake of LFR will even attempt to do MC so this is a moot argument, the problem with a lot of people in raiding is the commitment, anyone that has cleared a normal raid in the last few tiers could easily breeze through anything Classic has to offer
---
I'm 19 level with like 32 hours played but I'm pretty shit so.
---
I did disable them and it still happens, I thought it was my mouse but same issue with a different one.
---
Always found him utterly annoying before this anyway, but you are right.
---
How much heal gear do I need to heal leveling dungeons as a Ret spec paladin?
---
What kind of gear do I even want? Spirit?
---
Looks like he is in Duskwood
---
Good to know. Thanks a bunch
---
Clear example of someone who's come from retail and underestimated the challenge that was vanilla wow. Best bit is this is the most op patch. It was waaay harder before 1.12 buddy.
---
When RP goes to far
---
I'd rather they gave me a free month of game time lol.  You know, something actually useful to me.
---
Every steamer I've tried to watch (not just the huge ones) has either been farming dungeons or has the same 4 people following them round killing quest monsters for them and feeding them gold and items
---
Can't you get the same model later on (level 56 or something)?
---
I currently have the ghostsaber but I was thinking of maybe switching to this one because it look quite cool and it's cool to know that you stole it from the horde 😅 but then again if you can get it at like 56 it makes it a lot less cool.
---
helping, buffing, chilling and heal other out of pure fun. i had such a great weekend \^\^

 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Shazzrah Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
I get 60fps, my download speed is 87mbps and upload is 26mbps and a latency of 9ms if thats helpful too.
---
The guy is frustrated, heartbroken and just wanted to vent. And you just shit on him because of some B grade psychoanalysis. I can tell by what you wrote that you're a trash fuck
---
Thats nice. Then i can lvl it and have 15 lvl 120s
---
Question on Skinning Profession..So I just learned skinning as level 13 (Orc, hunter if that matters). I am now in barrens and can't skin anything since they all require a higher skinning level than I am.
---
Do I have to go back to the starting zone and kill boars and skin there or is there another way to level up skinning after missing out in the beginning?
---
Where to go after finishing loch modan as dwarf lvl 17?
---
Kirtonos is busy but no queue. I went there when Herod was unplayable. Home sweet home now :)
---
Don't know of any addons that do this - Healbot does do that kind of - as it will display in a gui how much your heal will heal them for but only if you're casting it (doesn't show instant casts).
---
All good points. One more thing regarding point 6: plan your death and die in the right place! Sucks to ress with SS within aggro range of mobs.
---
(That goes for everyone in the party, really. Die in places where a resser can reach you without accidentally pulling mobs)
---
It’s a forced decision. Doesn’t really give him s casual experience if he can’t play with his friends does it?
---
&gt; Also, potion sell like trash on the auction.
---
Shame we're not on the same server, I got through potions like there's no tomorrow on my warlock. Hopefully you'll see an increase in revenue when P2 onwards hits.
---
Grats :)
---
I used to play on Khadgar!
---
How do you get health bars over mobs' heads? I was sure I remembered this, but I don't have it and it's making life really hard!
---
Yeah.
---
No different than any other "bugged pirate server" as the retail fanboys constantly love to trot out. Blizzard quality is trash tbh lmao
---
First an most importantly, only train the abilities you need to.
---
Skinning is a great one because you can vendor the leather as you go.
---
Heavy leather might sell OK because it's a mat for Silk Bags (10 slot).
---
I've found herbalism and mining to be a waste of time because the market is absolutely flooded and no one has extracted enough currency from the game itself yet. So the majority of your gold is going to come from the game. If you do decide to mine and herb, I would mail the mats to an alt and wait 30 days for them to come back.
---
Vendor everything you can and make sure you're picking up all greys/greens and selling them. Even making gear with leatherworking just to vendor it is a good way to make a few gold. This is pretty much what I did, and I had enough gold to buy my mount at lvl 42.
---
look at this guy flexing cuz he have a hat, fak you! (level 34, no hat still) 
---
:(
---
your laying it pretty thick mate. I just like his spotify playlist, Im sure I or anyone who really wanted to could get it, but its not that big of a deal
---
There was no dungeon queve when lich king started ... this was added later in that expansion
---
I remember that there was people who was inviting dungeon groups daily/ofen and I remembered names which was bad or those who have good groups and as priest they remebered me too so I was invited easily that was my queve :-) Good thing on this is that when u got some players together u will try harder with bad ones because It take time to find more ..
---
Make a post if you do.
---
Would consider making an alt and joining. Don't have much time to be serious about it but the revenge PvP guild backstory gives me a chub
---
X-perl unit frames.
---
Don't know if it's available for classic though.
---
New to the entire WoW experience. Orc Hunter.
---
I want a Cat as my pet. My first tame was a Savannah Prowler I have grown to level 18 with and absolutely loved. I just swapped to the grey/white lion "Echeyakee" from a quest because I really liked the skin of him.
---
With that said, he feels like he hits *slightly* harder, but with a much slower attack speed than my Savannah Prowler did. I have read conflicting reports that other cats have an attack speed of 1.2 - 1.6 and he is a cat with an attack speed of 2.0. I have also read reports that pets have been equalized to 2.0 across the board.
---
My questions, what are the attack speeds for the average cat? What is the attack speed of my Savannah Prowler vs my Echeyakee? Does my pet need to land a hit **before** they will use Growl? Finally, if I need my pet to draw aggro (which I do... a LOT), I seem to have some issues having my Echeyakee draw aggro as consistently as my Savannah Prowler did, so would one be better than the other for drawing aggro due to attack speed?  
---
Thank you for any help, I am learning WoW from the ground up.
---
Not worth the talent imo. Most people open with shield -&gt; holyfire/mindblast -&gt; pain -&gt; wand
---
Where's a good place to learn classic lore?
---
Can you tame him? If so I think I will just stick with my ghost saber.
---
i found lvling cooking without fishing is a nightmare early on, once you get to 200 for spiders it becomes easier
---
They used the prisons of the old gods. wait about 15 years and they will unlock it for you with AP.
---
I think there’s a bigger rivalry between horde and alliance on a pvp for example if you see an opposite faction player dying to mobs on a normal realm you would normally help the player, in a pvp realm you would help the mob haha
---
I laughed so much from this drama. One word and everything failing apart. Take it as lesson and set boundaries as the very first thing. That is what you can use to enfirce your views in community. Something that is not ok for you maybe ok for others, when it is not said loud and clear - people wouldn't know it.
---
I’m right there with you- feels good for this old man to shed some learning on new players and actually getting a genuine thank you out of it.
---
Congratz! Keep up the good work :)!
---
&gt; You just play when and how much you want.
---
As someone who currently plays both retail since vanilla and classic (120 of each class + four allied race alts being level 50-80, and currently two level 25 toons) I think that statement is completely ridiculous and is a great example of how people really either; 
---
a) want to embellish the state of retail due to their own nostalgia generated bias 
---
OR 
---
b) doesn't play retail for their own enjoyment (or just doesn't play retail)
---
I'm not trying to hate on you but since classic I've jumped on retail to check my missions (periodically, sometimes via the app), level alts in dungeons (takes from 20mins to an hour depending on the dungeon), complete a mythic 10+ (up to an hour) and also pugged a few Heroic EP bosses (cherry picking for specific loot).
---
I can avoid PvP as I know the conquest system will allow me to sit down and smash out a few days worth of arenas when I get time with my mates who're also on classic.
---
I've included the times because to me they can be usually completed within those time slots. I can jump on and off when I want. People have been doing this for well before classic existed, it's called time management. You can sit there and pretend you can't jump onto retail and level an alt via quests at a steady pace without looms too but you can still quest at your own pace in retail. But that goes for both games and all activities. You can pick and choose and work at what you want.
---
e.g. waiting until darkmoon fair is up and choosing a daily hub/reputation (fishing friends) from a previous expansion that you hadn't done before to min-max rep. 
---
You say there are "hooks" but when you put aside your own personal need to be at the top and pretend it's a race, neither version of the game is going to be fun. Both will seem like a job when you're playing it that way eventually. 
---
I'm not sure if clout chasing, compensating or e-peen come into what you "can and can't do" but I'd advise that you play what you want, when you want and forget about what other people are doing unless you're playing with them.
---
You can do whatever you want in retail, as you can in classic. To say you can't in both is absurd.
---
How about DeadlyBossMods?
---
Conversely I’m a rogue with engineering and I love helping people out while I’m questing solo. For instance I saw a guy die to Kodos on the side of the road - pulled out the jumper cables, rezzed him, and was on my way. Another job well done
---
Because there's a lot of content that's designed to be experienced as you level up and it's fun to do. Have you never played an RPG before?
---
This cat is from a horde only summon quest. I waited for it.
---
This honestly ruined the launch. I hope blizzard announces new fresh truly classic servers in for November.  
---
Truly an astonunding failure, I don't understand what the point of beta was except to figure this kind of thing out. I've abandoned my 33 and moved to Anathema (or netherwind), the only decent server untouched by exploits.  
---
You should all be ashamed if you did this.
---
That helps too!
---
Ok, im gonna say this again. Those who cleared the raids are much MUCH better than you. You wont be able to do it as easy as them, not even close. So for 95% of the playerbase that will clear them it means absolutely nothing. And for the remaining 5% it just means they lost the race.
---
Then do your research before you say anything.
---
Why y’all so mad? Upset you didn’t think of it first?
---
Any gear can, and this has been confirmed by blizz, titanforge as much as any other gear.
---
It is just very rare. As it has to proc the forging for every five item levels.
---
So, no its not inaccurate, not sure what you wanted to answer either, but your post had nothing to do with lfr being able to Titan forge to mythic quality...
---
Oh no you killed Stitches..
---
"Can I add you incase I have questions later?" 
---
Big grin. Love it.
---
&gt;That's still illegal you know.
---
Private copy is not illegal.
---
If this was a private server everyone would have said "undertuned easy bugged pirate server lul" but ohhh how the tables have turned.
---
Not to mention the ridiculous raid XP which anyone who played vanilla could have told you was bugged. And LAYERING LOL. If a private server released in this state in 2019 they would be absolutely crucified by the community. But You're gonna give blizzard a pass?
---
The post SCREAMS with melodramatic tendencies. I don't know how long you have been on the internet, however I have been on here long enough to detect sociopaths trends and this post has all the checkmarks.

&lt;Ethos&gt; NA-PVP | Alliance | **[Kirtonos]** Semi-hardcore PVE / (Tues/Thurs 7:30-10:30pm CST)
---
**About us:** A fabled few came together with similar interests, level of play and determination to form the guild known as ‘Ethos’. A group of close players that have been raiding with each other over the years but now are turning their focus towards Classic. A fresh start and ultimately a perfect point in time to expand the roster. 
---
**Leadership:** Understanding of group make ups, debuffs, buffs and preparedness is vital to progress effectively in Classic. We are confident to build a strong foundation of players to strive with one another and learn along the way. Classic is about the social aspect and we intend to take that seriously. 
---
**Schedule:** We are currently looking at Tues /Thurs - for our main raid nights with the chance of a off night forming for 20mans. 7:30-10:30pm CST. 
---
**Loot:** (SK) We understand the importance of each individual in regards to how loot is handled and the way it is distributed. Considering a few factors; position in raid (ie. MT), and a specific item list, we have decided to use the Suicide King system. As a guild we will try our hardest to maintain and equally distribute the desired loot under the above circumstances. This system will be discussed in further detail during guild meetings.
---
**Goals / Expectations:** Knowing how / where the guild will progress over the next few months is key for a new member to take into consideration when picking a home. At Ethos we are committed to providing a reasonable set of requirements and goals a semi hardcore raider would come to expect. (Attendance, consumables, class knowledge, positivity!)
---
**Positions:** We are currently recruiting DPS (Locks / Mages) and 1 Prot Warrior. Apply and you will most likely find a raid spot! Of course over the leveling process, positions will fill up and a permanent roster will begin to form. 
---
**To Apply:** Straight forward application process - DM me for application form. 
---
**Discord:** Saw#8386
---
**Reddit:** Sawsy587
---
I imagine this being written in so much enthusiasm that he just forgot about them. He has a point tho, I've experienced the exact same feelings. But yeah, paragraphs would make it easier to read :)
---
They will. 
---
If you get lucky and get an item from lfr that titanforge to 445, it will be the same as the mythic version, except for any cosmetic differences.
---
Its been recorded yesterday, what nerf do you speak of ?
---
I've never been an asmongold fan, his online persona didn't really sit well with me, very aggressive, over the top and a bit of an a**hole. But, seeing some of his non wow videos, seeing him open up on camera, softened me a bit. I still did t really watch his streams but my husband who went to  classic (I don't have the patience or the drive for it anymore) has been listening to his streams daily and he's actually the reason I'm considering going back, seeing the big open world PvP he did, the guild revolting over tabards and even just farming zul farrack peaked my interest and looked really fun, I'm honestly enjoying his streams now and seeing him having fun having a laugh and playing it his way, doesn't sit with everyone of course but I'm liking his classic stuff atm.
---
I made a google spreadsheet with all the pre raid bis items i need and where they drop with links to everything you could ever need. Its gonna be handy when i ding.
---
Well I am not calling for punishing some random jello dude but there definitely is a good chunk of people who instigated the whole thing that were very well aware of what it was.
---
If you regularly play with other players, it is useful to pick professions together and without overlap. If you don't have a regular group, I would probably choose based on my favorite roleplaying choice. I have picked engineering on my orc warrior, but not to min-max or pvp, but because I have never leveled that profession and love the goggles and the general idea of it.
---
However, engineering is a bit modern for high fantasy, going more into a steampunk direction, and I get that some people don't like it. As a paladin, blacksmithing + mining make a lot of sense, even for a high fantasy setting. Alchemy + herbalism are also possible, more in line with the healer / holy paladin idea (doesn't mean you have to play holy, there is no extra benefit here). 
---
I wouldn't pick Leatherworking or Tailoring because you can't use the results yourself. On the other hand, gathering materials only to sell them seems a little wasteful as well. It can be very satisfying to gather your own materials and craft something with them.
---
Enchanting is possible, but it works best when you can craft your own items to disenchant. And for this, Tailoring is best, because it requires no gathering profession. 
---
However, for me, classic is about consciously making suboptimal choices and enjoying the way to 60 more than the endgame (for now). So I think choices like Enchanting plus some gathering profession, or picking skinning + leatherworking even if you can't use the result, would be options I might consider. 
---
If this is your first playthrough, I would probably pick Engineering if you like Steampunk, Blacksmithing if you want to be as badass as possible, and Alchemy if you picked Paladin because he is a mage as well as a warrior. If none of these are to your liking, or you really enjoy the idea of enchanting your armor, maybe pick Enchanting + Skinning.
---
Why do you care? It doesn’t affect you either way
---
Doubtful, plenty of games survive on 2k to 3k population.  Classic and tbc can coexist and thrive.  Population of classic will drop but Condense servers to one or two if that's even needed?  Classic private servers have been thriving for years theres a desire for it.  At the end of naxx people are going to want more content.  Working in new classic content is great to think about but is not going to happen.
---
I'm not seeing servers go from straight classic to tbc expansion too many people want straight classic.  Hell, I'd even enjoy logging back on my 60 in classic and doing shit here and there.
---
ban all 60s kek
---
Don't care either way
---
You seriously mentioned druid?
---
Ok, here is the COMPLETE balance druid dps rotation:
---
Starfire.
---
Offhealing? For what? You barely can die anyways in group content. Let the healer do their job and offer them innervate now and then. And compared to retail, you barely use your toolkit. In retail you always have to use your cc and healing and have to switch forms to megrate damage.
---
I finally got several friends to group on one server. We ended up on Sulfurus as Horde. Medium population on off hours and high to full during peak times. Queue isn't too bad. We're enjoying it.
---
Swords if you can get two. If you can only get one, a dagger in your offhand is good for poison procs with the sword still in your main hand.
---
That's not true at all. There are 6 phases, not 4.

Here's [a more detailed schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bawsup/the_complete_classic_plan_pve_pvp_phases/).

He brings dishonor to his faction.

It has changed, for the worse. 15 years ago it was chuck norris, anal thunderfury and your mom jokes. Now its all a bunch of MAGA hat wearing retards trying to own the libs. Personally I prefer the old version.
---
If you are less than 13 years old you have serious problems to address in your life
---
As a warlock I sometimes chase people who've buffed me so I can ram a healthstone into their inventory.
---
However now I have water breathing so I'm going to cast that on everyone!
---
No thanks, I have no interest in that content.
---
So I wanted to play pvp realm, but my friends went to RP realm. It's gonna be rough for me to deal with no world pvp, but I am not even sure how BG gonna be like on such realm. Do ppl play BGs on RP servers? Are there going to be cross-realm BGs?
---
Why say BZ and MD instead of RFC and WC...? Never seen that before
---
Gotta love people ignoring the "humor" tag on the post and actually getting their jimmies rustled.
---
Can also confirm he is a horrible and unreliable guildie. Ditched my guild two hours before our first of two days of Naxx that week, said he was quitting Lightbringer for good. Then ended up coming back two months later. Not the first time he's ditched like this unknowingly either.
---
Mind sharing the link? :)
---
Looks a lot like ElvUI to me, could be wrong though.
---
It's great isn't it. Every green feels like an actual *upgrade* and damn, blues feel fantastic.
---
I don't even mind that it's taking me so long to level. Straying off the path to pick flowers and explore new places is part of the charm.
---
It's too early to say whether I'll go back to retail, but I haven't even thought about it in weeks.
---
And this is one of the biggest "dangit muscle memory" things I keep running into. I've accidentally watched a mage and two hunters die because my finger-to-brain reaction went "low on health, about to take immediate damage, optimal solution: shield".
---
And then lost a warrior because in the two seconds it took me to remember "can't shield it doesn't work" and actually apply what I'd learned, the best my slightly-panicking brain came up with was "renew is insta-cast, use that!". Which is a very nice spell but didn't solve the "about to take immediate damage" part of the problem.
---
(yes, I ressed them all, my res button has been in the exact same location since 2005 and worked identically all that time)
---
Source? Because that sounds like a huge lie tbh.
---
A good measure of your profession skill relative to your present level is to divide your skill by 5. For example at level 13 a skinning skill of 65 should be suitable :)
---
Not playin' retail even if they paid me too.
---
That's only for EU.
---
Deadmines dungeon can either be (DM or VC) DM for deadmines but the is the problem that DM is also Diremaul, so some people say that deadmines is VC for Van Clief

Check out Ebbnflow on YouTube. He has the best tips, tricks, and guides on everything Druid. He doesn't just say what to do, he explains the why, as well. He goes over strategies against the other classes. Druid PvP is a lot of kiting, which, is a lot of fun, IMO.
---
You can set that up in unit frames. I'm using the raid (not raid40) for the unit frames and use the buff tab to show the buffs you apply.
---
Clique makes the macros for you. You open your spell book. Go to the clique tab then just hover over the spell you want to bind and press the key you want to bind.
---
It's just easier than making 14 macros by hand
---
Typical Alliance mains.
---
Which is why I said they shouldn't do TBC+
---
Haha casual racism is fun!
---
Well it would do better in the hands of a caster. It’s like rolling on the 6 int 2 agi ring in deadmines as a rogue for the agi.
---
Thanks, this is now my wallpaper :) Love Ashenvale too
---
&gt;Speaking of taking you out of combat. That doesn't actually work, because your pet doesn't get dropped from combat. 
---
I'm pretty sure that's how it always worked back in the days. I remember sending my pet away before feigning death in raids/dungeons when it was a wipe. But I haven't played hunter in vanilla and I'm not sure if they went back and forth with how it worked or if there are differences at boss fights versus other fights.
---
Probably the safest and most efficient class for leveling.
---
They use every single stat, every new item can be useful.
---
The pet mechanic is good. You can tame different pets with unique abilities, you have to feed them, train them... also keeping your ammunitions loaded ! it's lot of obligation, but it give a unique flair to the class, same thing for tracking opponents on the minimap.
---
Also, hunter backs then isn't just about shooting the opponent to death, they have quite a surprising number of melee attacks and skills. A survival-oriented hunter is a hybrid between melee and ranged that can be very annoying to face in Pvp and will literally never die in open world.
---
It does less dps than sand, smite, holy fire, mind blast. Flay only gets good once you have talents further down the shadow tree. I’m leveling as a holy shadow hybrid. I have high dps but low pvp ability and survival but I can heal dungeons better. There is no optimal build
---
Who's gonna pay your sub then :(
---
Yep, that's exactly it.
---
Don't get me wrong, I loved WQ's in legion, but that was because I loved the expansion so much and they were fresh and so good in comparison to dailies. So doing all of them every day didn't feel like a chore. But I didn't much like the idea of bfa from the get go and doing WQ' s there is really feeling like a chore.
---
Hi, /u/RuRu92

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cyn5wo/what_has_been_your_most_wholesome_experience_in/). 
---
No.It is up to Blizzard to check these things before launch. There had been ALOT of talk about dungeon grinding on Beta.... Maybe they should have invested some hours looking into this BEFORE launch?
---
Like you guessed, go back to starter area's and skin low level beasts!
---
It's why I play a druid tank. I set the pace of the dungeon. If they don't like it, they can leave. I've had a blast with dungeons so far though, no drama or anything. :)
---
Playing 5-6 hours a day is not casual AF my dude
---
That is retail only.
---
Free server xfers off exploited realms for &lt;30s imo or something like that. These dickheads ruined entire servers and communities.. way to really fuck launch up blizz.
---
Only retail
---
Blizzard wont because they just dont care probably.
---
I see you're a warlock? If this if your main, Tailoring &amp; Engineer is perfect combo for PvE&amp;PvP.
---
They're mad because servers wouldn't have queues 90% of the day if people stopped doing this shit to avoid the 10% that does.
---
The f2p is only retail for Classic you need a sub but only a sub.
---
I managed to do it in 5 hours as a druid. But I was no where near optimal and this is my first experience of classic. So I'd assume faster than that xD
---
No lags here, never
---
Way more than Asmon to be real.
---
That's for them all to decide, if they decide to not swap realm then he has to suffer the consequence s of the queue times. If he blames anyone it's his friends
---
Who's recruiting for DM East jump runs in Westfall anyway?
---
Even if I did I doubt he’d stick to it haha
---
Still sounds boring as fuck after an hour or two. I'll stick to the world leveling and questing, thanks.
---
ARR felt very much like a grind, especially the storyline.  However the dungeons do get a bit more variable after that.
---
Also the Heavens ward expansion was amazing. The storyline is one of my favourites ever.
---
That said, I hate how progression is gated behind main storyline.
---
ARR storyline dragged on far too long, so much so I was nearly level 58 before I got to the Heavens ward expansion.
---
As much as I love FFXIV, it does feel like at times like a single player RPG with multilayer elements than a MMO.
---
But he did.
---
BZ &lt;3
---
About that ;)
---
dm guild?
---
Im horde, and the allies can just write on this post when they are gonna show up and il be ready in the dark with a dagger.
---
What's the name of those nameplates?
---
This happened to me last night. Me and this guy killed those werewolf glutton / darksouls for 45 minutes to get the quest items, he finished and I still needed one more but I said I didn't mind if he left and he stayed until I got the drop
---
Is engineering profitable or completely over saturated because of pvp advantage
---
You're looking for the HotW build  0/30/21 :)
---
My guild mates are currently doing that but in vanilla. They are always brain afk playing vanilla while focussing on other stuff. They are mas that you cant play retail when you open vanilla because they could afk-level in classic while doing stuff in retail lile flying from point a to b, waiting for a rare simming or scanning the AH
---
7.5k queue will probably be 3-4 hours from my experience this week
---
Yeah 2 hr to start. Might be safer to go 2,5 hr.
---
Dunno if they changed it in BFA, but when I last played, instead of having a "tree" we had talent "tiers". Every 20 or so level youwould unlock one talent tier and get to chose between three options that would either give you a completely new skill or augument a existing skill in a major way.
---
Yeah when we started to plan for classic a friend of mine said we should totally make our own guild. No way.
---
I have been playing this game for 15 years. Guild leaders get sucked dry by it. Good officers are very rare and many want to do it as a power thing and not really do any work.
---
Beside you have to organize a homepage, a voice chat, etc.
---
I'll happily lead a raid or organize a few events but organizing 60+ people as a whole? No fucking way.
---
Ah yeah someone outleveling you by being efficient is "trash", maybe you should look in the mirror m8
---
On my realm 7.5k usually means 3-4h que.
---
&gt; We thought more highly of you. 
---
I did not.
---
Asmongold is one of the streamers I really have a hard time to watch/listen.
---
! Ragnaros downed with a group with half not lvl 69 and in greens
---
! Moonkins suck
---
I still feel like Gnome and Goblin druids could be a thing in retail.  Instead of turning into animals, they would instead operate mechanized versions of them.
---
Everyone has something. My favorite is the drive-by cheap shot from rogues
---
You have been able to update databases in production since forever.
---
They didnt exploit a bug, it's just undersight.
---
wait i have an led lamp you gave me a sick ass idea
---
I had to close lfg chat because all I see is INV LAYER CHANGE PLZ every second
---
This is the message Blizz is sending to all in case they don't ban.
---
They wont do other xpacs. And WOTLK was worst expansion. Soz
---
True :)
---
A recent survey on this sub said that most people are looking forward to raids in classic. What else is there to do?
---
And he needed in items that were an upgrade? What a pos
---
VC on sargeras
---
if it makes you feel better im a level 43 warrior with 65G
---
I recently moved from Golemagg EU to Mograine, best choice i've made so far, just wish i made it sooner.
---
Yeah because we will be 60 lol and the xasuals will still be 40 and will be left to level in peace.
---
...jk we are going to gank the shit out of you :)
---
Says he works at Arkane studios, Santa people who made dishonored. Does he do both? Or did he move from Blizzard to arkane
---
You cannot tame him.
---
I believe the "/cast !Auto Shot" allows you to spam your shots keys without interrupting the auto-shot cycle

Life before death 
---
Strength before weakness.

Journey before destination.

C L A S S I C E X P I E R E N C E
---
Rightclick it in your petbar or pet spell book.
---
Fire Ward requires level 20 to learn, making it rather difficult to cast at level 16
---
This seems to be a 5 man group and thus not affected by the nerf
---
It's probably an API.
---
Come to incendius! Full pop, but was released at launch instead of earlier, will probably plateau at a perfect level
---
Clearly it isn't for you. Move along. It's nice you felt the need to tell us how garbage this game is though. Please go back to Retail and never come back.
---
Why bother it's earsier and faster to lv 1-120 than 1-60 and you'd earn a fuck tone of gold.
---
Continue with your warlock, Hunter maintenance is so bad. I prefer having to farm some soulshards than having to buy ammo, and food for my pet. Hahaha. Warlocks are awesome too, that class fantasy is amazing!!
---
Because nobody can enjoy something you don't and obviously they hate themselves now.
---
Blizzard alone is not helping as it not has a slow built in. At lv22/23 you can skill the slow into the spell, making it a powerful solo-aoe-level ability.
---
i got both /shrug
---
Legion was... forgettable
---
Nothing!
---
Can't buff as a hunter, but I'll throw an arcane shot after your mob if it looks like you're in trouble :D
---
So you have just one ability and that feels more impactful than having a hart hitter within your rotation thaz you build up?
---
Leveling to 110 isn't what's keeping a lot of us from playing retail...
---
Fishing in Wailing Caverns while waiting for your group to arrive and/or wipes is great, get some Deviate Fish to sell on AH or use!
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6657/savory-deviate-delight
---
People are very divided on wotlk it seems. Story wise and what not it was fantastic and it had really cool and fun raids. However, it also introduced LFG and some other things that were not as welcoming.
---
I was just running with a gnome that told me about this. How does it work exactly?
---
This looks so fucking cozy
---
Meet [Broken Tooth](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=2850/broken-tooth#comments), one of the most sought-after pets for pvp in Vanilla.
---
One of the comments there says that he has a 1.00 attack speed, while Echeyakee has a 2.00 attack speed, and they both do the same dps, so yeah, Echeyakee's attacks would do double the damage on average.
---
Always void m8, mostly, but go on mob by mob basis if you know what you're doing
---
Is this a real thing? I just had a fight over Snarlsnout in the barrens because 18+ people camping him
---
Good to hear
---
You’re so stupid. 🤢🤢
---
Its because when vanilla launched. It was the first dungeon and no one really knew about it. After you completed the quest chain, you got to the quest to kill Van Cleef. People started grouping up looking for members to kill Van Cleef (like Hogger) and it became VC on OG servers like Magtheridon.
---
Astral power was a WoD design because Starsurge in times like MoP would prog to uSe because of a crit and wasn’t a resource spender. In Classic oomkins not only have to spam Starfire but it costs a TON of mana and by not having any passive mana generation during combat or some sort of clear casting prof they rely heavily on mana pots and Demonic Runes. But those are also used quickly into a fight so they go oom extremely fast. So they cast slow, doesn’t hit very hard compared to other casters, and has no way to get mana back during a fight outside of consumes (if you actually Innervate yourself to keep DPSing rethink your life).
---
Tl;dr the class is designed horribly and just does everything terribly
---
I don't really agree. I didn't even know it was an exploit until the bluepost came out (Only Blizzard knows how things work on the reference client). Are you gonna ban people for doing something they thought was Vanilla? Slippery Slope there.
---
It sucks, but nothing can be done now other than just move on. Rag would have been dead 10-20 hours later anyways without the bug so I can't care much about it.
---
Just yesterday i used my hearth to darkshire and guess who was already waiting there inside the tavern?
---
Our friend Stitches...
---
When people talk about it being a bad person they are referring to him in the context of wow, not rl. It's like when people talk about American policies being shit, they are not talking about the people living in the us (largely) but more regarding the government.
---
It’s not just the nostalgia, it’s the engaging gameplay, community and the challenge. Playing classic has shown me why the retail game is so boring now. Little things like mob tagging encourage people to group and work together, it makes the experience. Tons of the people playing probably never saw classic. Lots of the QoL elements in the game now make for a far less engaging experience.
---
He's mocking the people that say VC for Deadmines. Because it's fucking dumb to refer to a dungeon by the final boss. Or if you do, you should do the same for all of them.
---
PT for Maraudon. BR for Dead Strat. DMG for Scholo, etc.
---
Shaman's ghost wolf is +40% speed.
---
I've heard normal mounts are +60% and epic mounts are +100%. Is that correct? If so I suppose its not so vital to get mount on lvl 40 as I can have 1 sec cast wolf form...?
---
Press "V" (default keybind).
---
NP bro, i just feel a bit weird because the stam buff only is useful is someone survives something with &lt;100 left. 
---
Its amazing for druids though. Here a buff, now hand over the thorns and mark.
---
Type LFG *your class spec and level* into the general chat (/1) people will whisper you :) I f you are DPS you will need to whisper people probably as there are plenty out there
---
They were getting much more xp than intended though. That's what was bugged. They get less. They dont get as little as intended though.
---
Woosh
---
It's a joke because some people say VC (VanCleef) instead of DM (Dead Mines)
---
All instances are called by their name not by their bosses.
---
Sounds like you need a better guild, thats the real problem why would you come cry on reddit about it?
---
Lvl19 rogue here. Where do I get sword training?
---
I was aimlessly running around alot. I didn't get Questie till level 9 so that severely hampered me. The good news is it only gets quicker now you have bear form :D
---
You may find that the lower level stuff is now going up in price as people are more commonly using higher level stuff to gain levels. On my server, swiftness potions are profitable
---
I'm getting the error No player named '%t' is currently playing
---
In the beginning of launch, it's almost better to sell everything to vendors. The prices are low, and the gain isn't so worth it compared to the time spent going to an actual AH.
---
Why do you read them all?
---
Because you are a rogue. Try one of the gimp classes and come back.
---
Lol!  I have been playing more than usual this week and I am level 12.  30 isn't hardcore, but it isn't casual either.

For PvP realms: If you are in one of your factions zones with your PvP flag turned off (such as a starting area) then the opposite faction can’t attack you unless you attack them or turn on your pvp flag. If you’re in a contested zone then your pvp flag is automatically turned on and anyone can attack you. If you hover over the zone name on your minimap it will tell you the zone type. If you have your factions icon on your character portrait that means your PvP flag is turned on. 
---
After a certain point you have to go to contested zones for leveling and sometimes pass through the opposite factions territory which is why you see alliance players in your zone.
---
I play on a queueless server (Transcendence-EU) and I still have to pick it manually every time.
---
guess it's true what they say
---
haters gonna hate
---
Wait let me also add:
---
!players totally sucked back in the day and didnt know how to play.
---
In all seriousness im only lv 34 on a rogue but dungeons and grp content are a lot easier than people make it out to be. Id imagine druids arent bad at all and considering raids are easier than people remember there are plenty of slots in a 40 raid that can fit these weird niche specs. Theres no need for a meta as it seems right now.
---
I should have ran to Darkshire, but instead I flashed back to 12-year-old me and nearly shat my pants as I ran into some other mobs and died a horrible death at the hands of Stitches, among others.
---
On my warrior i hand smoked sagfish out to the casters for dungeons. Every little bit helps.
---
Hi, /u/Catttalyst

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cyna6b/discord_servers_for_mograine_eu/). 
---
Because it's not like you're not going to be able to do the content if you have a ret in a raid or a druid tank in SM. What is the point of doing the content if you're just going to rush through it as quickly as possible?
---
FIXED not nerfed
---
You're wasting your breath, this sub has gone 150% full retard mode since launch
---
With his cars wifi
---
roll at about 19h, it will have the best presentation of queue times
---
This is me right now. What did you start at? My herbalism is only like 12 but these red plants are upsetting me.
---
Warlock requires DM W so no, although maybe the initial quests are available (doubtful). 
---
Unsure about Paladins.
---
Thank you!! I'd actually heard of Broken Tooth before as a pet, but by and large the reason I took Echeyakee was for the unique skin. Does Broken Tooth have any visual differences over a standard Prowler?
---
I planned to go for him around level 37 when I could get the higher leveled version of him, as I plan to PvE until about level 40. Do you think I should sack Echeyakee for Broken Tooth at this early stage in the game for the attack speed increase? I've adjusted my playstyle to let Echeyakee attack before I launch my Concussive Shot to allow better aggro pull, but would the attack speed offer a better aggro pull than Echeyakee's?
---
Most of this is coming for a PvE perspective for the "flash" of a neat pet at the moment. I'd like to keep Echeyakee for the looks, but if Broken Tooth would offer a substantial jump in abilities, I am willing to stable Echeyakee and (sadly) release my original pet for Broken Tooth.
---
As a level 18 warrior who hasn't dungeoned, why is 3 to 4 warriors a good group?
---
It's not like they haven banned en mass streamers for exploiting before. Plus it would be publicity for them
---
A lot of the quests went from being elite and difficult to normal mobs... Especially named mobs.. There are still some elite quests but greatly reduced
---
Lol I run around skinning all the animals everyone else has killed. 😂
---
How does someone like you even have friends? You sound like a whiny bitch lol
---
Go to classic.wowhead.com, pick a zone, show questgivers in that zone. I know it is not an addon but that is pretty effective and costs you only alt+tab.
---
It got fixed 10 hours after someone posted the comprehensive post with details here on this subreddit. Remember, if you come across with a major bug, document it as well as you can, and especially prove that 1) the bug exists, 2) the bug is a bug and not a feature. Many people mistook the raid xp farming as a vanilla feature, when it indeed was only a bug  And most importantly, send youe findings to the devs.
---
I got slaughtered every time I tried to kill something before I found a bunch of friends. I’d curse a mage and she’d bring 9 friends and their stupid blueberry tanks.
---
Well, maybe it is. But it's pure technical issue that have nothing to with "classic experience". It's like saying that you can get "classic experience" because you ISP have maintenance. Sure, Blizzard is to blame for the whole mess, but it have nothing to do with classic experience.
---
I had no idea... this game is truly full of wonder lol
---
3s cast time apparently https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/welcom-back-to-early-vanilla-mounting-systems/172321
---
Yeah, I agree with you
---
Have a look at this. Im not certain but its possible you have a corrupt UI. https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7549
---
A good time is like 2 hours. Did that with my rogue. 
---
A better time is 1 1/2 hours with a class like mage.
---
Not anymore ;)
---
You can have my +15 Int buff all day
---
That's the beauty of it though. You get a choice!
---
Flip a coin. If you feel the slightest sense of disappointment about the flip's result pick the other one.
---
Your subconscious already know what you want and this trick is meant to surface the result.
---
Don't get me wrong I don't like Fortnite but I don't have to run up to people who enjy it and shit on it all day, frankly I have better things to do with my life, like just doing nothing is more productive.
---
Its still a world first
---
People noped out of MOP because they dedicated an entire expansion to a meme.
---
A zone or quest line would have been enough, but nope blizztard decided they're going to make an entire expansion out of PANDAS.
---
Solid points, fully agree!
---
"Why did you let me die??!"
---
"Dude...I said OOM!!"
---
No thanks.
---
Or they are both.
---
The bonus for wearing leather is drinking the tears of the rogues and druids who lost the roll, though.
---
That reduction is only for raids so you can still 5man farm with no reduction, just stuff won’t die quite as fast
---
Ruin it? Ok dude
---
Literally for any combination of 2 numbers there is a 1/10000 chance, so it's more accurate to say that there was a 2% chance to not lose
---
I've seen this so much. People complaining about the way other people are playing classic. 
---
Like this guy in the comment section on wowhead:
---
&gt; It's not even real Wow. The only people playing are those that sabotaged playing wow by rushing and skipping and not actually playing the real game. 
---
&gt; It's not vanilla. It's not live BfA. Its not Wow's second coming. Its just content that wow burnouts can consume and then cry about after they ruin their game experience on there too. Crazy stuff
---
The proper answer to that question is quite long, involves a fair bit of numbers, and you will not get it by asking this sub.
---
**&lt;ZANCOR&gt;[HORDE][FAIRBANKS-PVP][SEMI-HARDCORE RAIDING][PST]**
---
**We are recruiting for two raid teams, both teams will be raiding at the same time!**
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**Who are we?**
---
Ladies, gentlemen, trolls, orcs, demons, whathaveyous...We are Zancor Gaming, a newly formed gaming community that is itching to hit up the glory days of classic WoW in full force. We are a dedicated bunch looking to push top tier end game content and have a blast while doing so. Who knows ...maybe you’ll make a few lifelong friends along the way. We’re about having fun, meeting new people, and kicking ass. Our player base mainly comprises of individuals between 25-32 years of age with a variety of gameplay experience.
---
We welcome both battle hardened Warcraft players and those who are just joining our world. We foster an atmosphere of teaching those who are learning and doing their best every time they show up, if we’re not improving, then we’re not doing our job.
---
**Who are you folks looking for?**
---
First and foremost ...we’re a raiding guild. This means we eat, sleep, and dream PVE and dragon slaying strategies. We’re not super hardcore raiders pulling long hours into the night, but we aren’t for the faint of heart either. We will test your mettle and push you to become the best WoW player you can be. We ask that our members maintain a positive attitude and keep their eye on the prize, slaying bosses. New players can be molded into great raiders, but great attitudes can be hard to come by, we don’t care if you’re new to classic, as long as you’ve got a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. Do not be afraid to ask questions, today's students may be tomorrow's masters.
---
**Raid times?**
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday **8:30pm-11:00pm PST**.
---
Monday(Optional cleanup AKA “The Chungus Raid”) **8:30pm-10:30pm PST**
---
*3 Day lockout raid scheduling will be determined closer to the phase 3 patch.*
---
**What are your expectations?**
---
We expect our members to conduct themselves appropriately both in guild level chats as well as in public. Our members represent our guild to the public and each one should show nothing but respect and understanding to the general player community. Friendly ribbing is fine, but please keep it ToS friendly...we don’t need our friends being banned!
---
We also expect high raid attendance with minimal tardiness. Real life happens, we get it, if you need to miss a raid just let someone know before we start forming and you’ll be excused with no penalty. When we start forming, we expect raiders to come prepared with consumes, enchants, buffs(World buffs not required), and knowledge of our boss strategies. Failure to do so could result in a loss of EP for that specific raid being run. Our goal is to get our first raid up by week 3 or 4 of release, we’re not expecting everyone to bend over backwards and get to 60 and get geared up by week 1, but if you want to, you’ll have some buds to play with along the way.
---
*We also expect clear comms on boss attempts, call outs and communication are key when there are forty raiders in one channel. Banter and whatever else is fine during trash, but we expect to move through content like we’ve done this before… Because we have.*
---
**How about the loot system?**
---
We will be using EPGP with a whitelist. The whitelist is for items such as legendaries, certain BiS items, and tier set completions, when those instances arise, the loot council will make the decision of who gets what. The loot council consists of Officers/Class Leaders, and 3 raiders picked randomly each week to represent their fellow raiders, the GM will step in to break any ties.
---
Raiders can bonus EP each week for showing up early, with world buffs, and by contributing raid mats to the guild bank.
---
**What are you looking for?:**
---
**High Priority:**Healers, Melee Dps
---
**Mid Priority:**Tanks, Hunters, Warlocks, Feral Druid DPS/Offtank 
---
**Low Priority:** Mages, Shadow Priest.
---
**Admittance into the guild is a not a guarantee for a raid spot. We are over-recruiting so we can form the most effective raid roster.**
---
*Exceptional players of any class are encouraged to apply regardless of class priority need. Raid spots are not set in stone and can be contested. We are over recruiting so that we are guaranteed a full roster by at least week 3-4 to begin raiding.* 
---
**That sounds great! Where can I sign up?**
---
You can start with telling us a little about yourself [here!](https://forms.gle/cRucWvvKFSCrFDCb9)
---
You can also visit our discord if you have any questions. You can find that [here](https://discord.gg/PC9TQv4)
---
I've saved a ton of people, just by stopping by and throwing a heal their way.
---
It also feel nice to res randoms :p
---
I always beg mages for water so I gotta pay it forward somehow!
---
Hey I am 29 ud rogue on dreadmist. I need friends:(
---
I love that WoW is killing Fortnite.
---
See you in a few hours 🤣
---
It's fascinating how this is the case, yet the various races of Azeroth would come to survive massive bloody catastrophe after massive bloody catastrophe, while fighting a prolonged and bloody war with one another.
---
Blizzard's need to continually up the ante while also trying to keep the status quo is one of several things that really killed my investment in the story. Past a certain point it ceases to be an effective method of creating tension and it just becomes ridiculous. And it's become so popular that I'm tired of it, and my patience for it runs out fast.
---
I think the story would have been more compelling to me had they dealt with the consequences of most of those threats instead of sweeping it under the rug and trying to sustain the totally unsustainable Horde/Alliance conflict. It's hard to fight after running all your men and material through a woodchipper, a mulcher, and an industrial meat grinder.
---
Dunno. The way the Horde/Alliance conflict feels so shoehorned in the later expansions just bothers me.
---
He jelly
---
Always hated the 1-60, but somehow in this sub this is the pinnacle of what Classic was. To me it was absolute dogshit and it still is. 
---
I don't understand why speedrunning the leveling is ruining your vanilla experience.
---
I did sm runs with 4 mages and 1 priest, its amazing
---
When I run out of a building I have to wait 3-5 seconds before the game realizes I'm outdoors and can use travel form.
---
Or a 2nd screen.
---
It's font that comes with ElvUI
---
Pagle is THE elitest alpha male/wow purist server lol.
---
It was constant demands for QOL improvements that ultimately led to the mess of later expansions.  I personally loved acheivements and having dual spec (as it was when introduced, not later). I also liked Pally's actually being viable in all specs  However they kept adding more and more that people demanded, taking away more and more of what made Wow, wow.  So while some changes would be nice, where do you draw the line?  I can understand people's fears.  They have seen what can happen and are scared of it happening again.
---
People are mad at it because all these streamers cried for classic wow for so long saying “I want the good old times of grinding back” then all of them abuse an unintended bug to level quicker and then beg for gold (apart from some streamers like Soda who never begged for gold but stated he could if he wanted to). Just a bit hypocritical that’s all.
---
Try Questie
---
Aw dude, four strength four stam leather belt
---
It's always Gnomer. Keep on giggling if that's what makes you happy xD
---
bro, you gonna be swimming in gold!
---
My character is named "Changes". I want to play with this dude.
---
Nochange
---
I’ve played on Sargeras since vanilla, it may be just a American thing, but it was almost always VC, i still don’t understand why it’s such an issue, every server will have slightly different lingo.
---
Tailoring and enchanting pair well together especially for cloth wearers. Some high level tailoring robes are bind of pickup.
---
Herbalism and alchemy are great for any class and what I leveled as a mage in vanilla.
---
I appreciate you brother
---
I sometimes do, I should kidnap him irl I suppose so he wont do stupid stuff like work, hanging with so etc
---
If all the people whining about the XP group bug were to quit Classic, it would only be a good thing.
---
Are you not honored or higher with any of the capitals? If so, there's a 10% discount there.
---
No matter the context, you ment "these" expansions.
---
Combat spec gives you Riposte which is a fantastic talent for keeping downtime low.
---
Every time you parry an attack from an armed enemy, you get to deal a bunch of damage and they start hitting like a wet noodle for a few seconds.
---
Questie tells you exactly what to do for every quest which is what I want to avoid unfortunately.
---
And not a single fuck was given, by anyone, except people who are so heavily invested in a streamers life and the games they play, they have a mental breakdown when the streamer show atypical behaviours.   
---
The End.
---
Yes, I remember raiding strat/scholo in particular.... Sometimes my guild would have like 8 people that wanted to go farm gear and it wasn't enough for 2 groups so we would just all go.  We obviously didn't care about xp at 60 so it was fine.  I do remember when it was nerfed because as a healer I became in even higher demand lol
---
I'm sure all those people think 'he could save me but he shielded himself as an insult'.
---
Are you talking about the speech bubble? There is a tickbox in the standard WoW interface options that disables speech bubbles I think.
---
Where is it displaying their race here?
---
Wondering if I could go and solo or maybe AoE grind SFK as a almost 32 frost mage. Anyone know if this works or if it’s efficient for gold making?
---
Seems like theres a good chance you were just lagging. I've noticed a significant delay when servers are completely full than say when I wake up in the morning to play, it feels much more responsive. Based on how much variance I feel when it comes to the loot delay I'm inclined to think that it isnt spelll batching. Sometimes it just feels more responsive than other times.

Im sure its not my connection, im below 10 ms, above 100 Mbit and no annoying firewalls etc. I havent had to type my login in the wow client tho, will try it after work today and see if it solves the problem.
---
UUUGH!

Thats how i sometimes decide what to eat and it never failed me
---
"Everone can enjoy the game the way it pleases them" - except rushing, thats not allowed
---
Someone mentioned a few days ago that there is an option in questie to only show the quest givers.
---
I will give this a try until something better pops up thank you!
---
See if guildmates could use it (if in a guild), some greens are better than others depending on their stats so you could check the AH if you're willing to wait and hope it sells.
---
karma farmer or a dude who's weirdly obsessed with a streamer...hard to pin which one you are.
---
The warlock and two other players need to set up and click on a portal. It costs the warlock a soul-shard as well.
---
6 kids? Damn son.
---
Oh really? That would be exactly what I want. I will have to look into it!
---
I m not experiencing any lag...
---
Lol you don't know that dude you're replying to, as far as you know he might be the most chill person ever. And your excuse 'I bet sometimes you act like an asshole too so you can't judge anyone' is stupid.
---
You need to also think about the loot from those first week clears. Even if people are already downing the bosses we still have a while to go before people are crazy over-geared and that to me at least is what's cool.
---
That’s exactly what I choice I’m just not sure how to level them (tailoring and enchanting that is)
---
You can look up the guild &lt;Children of the Horde&gt;.  I'm a lvl23 mage named Window, will be online after 8 pm EET.
---
I suppose you have a point.
---
And OL would be even shorter ;) It's VC just like it was 15 years ago
---
29 Rogue, 2d 13h.
---
Imagine not min maxing a 15 year old game where we know everything and then being a casual elitist dick about it on reddit
---
Yeah. I've never regretted playing on a normal server, I'm a warrior, leveling is rough enough as it is without getting teabagged by rogues 24/7. When I want to PVP, I can go PVP. Otherwise piss off and let me die in peace.
---
I don't see the point of speedlevelling by grinding repeatedly a dungeon over and over again.. I respect everyone's reasons, but to me it seems a childish behaviour. Lol there's a huge world to explore and dive into and people stay in the same place killing the same mobs over and over again.. Lol I don't want to offend anyone but it sounds quite retarded to me: this is a huge mmo not a chinese hack n slash
---
You’re wrong. They are covering it not competing for it. It was literally spelled out for you a week before the game came out.
---
Every expansion was dedicated to a new class or race.  I'm sure people said the same thing in TBC about an expectation out of squid face aliens and fembois but really it was the next logical addition to the game, like Pandaria was.
---
If the quests are gray for you, they also don’t offer the same reputation. I might be wrong, but did darkshore yesterday and didn’t receive as much rep as expected.
---
Yeah but many is not all, and if i can prevent issues, might aswell i guess.
---
Going to? It already has. The sm cleave groups and zf groups were just the beginning. On my server, very specific cleave comps were made for "efficiency" and other classes were shit out of luck. I'll never understand this need to minmax in a classic. The game was beaten years ago, it's been theory crafted to death, and it's dungeon and raid content is piss easy in comparison to modern wow. Classic wasn't made with most guilds requiring bossmods in mind. People rushing to 60 are going to be in for a world of disappointment when they realize this.
---
10 man raiding ZF was a fun experience. You are the one who missed out. Leveling solo isn't going anywhere.
---
Someone needs to play wow more, I bet all where conceived during maintenance lol
---
Because Blizz are happy to provide a classic service that isn't enjoyable for a lot of people these days as it shares the subscription with live. Their hope is most likely that if they add all these little idiosyncrasies that made Vanilla what it was people will get bored of it and go back to/try out for the first time, retail.
---
Retail is the end game here for Blizzard, every decision is being made with the mindset of "Get people on to our main product"
---
This is pretty much the same on US-Sargeras
---
Flashbacks to Saturday?
---
Welcome to the new generation of gamers who demand instant gratification. Where any sense of accomplishment comes from the game telling them they have achieved something.
---
u meant wetlands?:)
---
He'll make it back home in a few expacs. RIP

Huzzar to that friendo
---
k bye
---
Love this
---
I ended up spending it all on cooking recipes from vendors when I saw them. It was only when I couldn’t afford the last one that the horror struck.
---
I am very happy that I started a day late on Ten Storms.
---
Noone abused the bug, max Level is 50 at the time of writing and the world pvp has been awesome so far.
---
Looks like this will be one of  the few Servers to be completely classic.
---
Also new, this is amazing news so glad I found this out early. Going to get onto fishing and cooking tonight :)
---
Different arguments now.
---
Flying mounts did non destroy world pvp ij azaroth as there were no flying mounts.
---
Azaroth a ghost town when the entire expansion is in a different zone?  Who wouldve...
---
Heroics did not shatter anything, if anything it xlosed the gap because of rep farming. 
---
Did YOU actually play TBC ? the things you seem to be stuck on were introduced in wotlk
---
Oh cool, ty.
---
Cringe through the roof!
---
Amazing how around only one in seven gnolls have paws.
---
Private servers were actually better lmao, the implementation we got here is kinda crap. Too bad you missed out on that.
---
haha definitely, I feel so dumb right now!
---
I guess it would split the community too thin
---
Don't feel bad, you learned something and probably got some use from it. It'll be months before that will able to be sold.
---
It usually take from 1h to 2h to login. I’m in the European server.
---
Wait, you don't have class trainers in modern wow? How do you get your skills then?
---
It is still 20% faster. I think the cutoff is at somewhere like 20 seconds. After that the mount is faster. If you have to travel a few zones a mount is definitely worth it.
---
PM Me for a free copy of Joana's guide
---
What gear stats should I be focusing on as a shaman? I’ve been clicking Greed on everything because I don’t want to Need the wrong thing and piss people off!
---
Also is the “of the Fang” set from WC decent for a shaman? I’ve got the gloves and not sure if I should be going for the rest.
---
&gt; bitching about this and server queues 
---
&gt; Just play the damn game. 
---
I can't, I'm in queue.
---
Until you get your first talent point you are just a rogue.  I know it's hard to understand but just try.  Also no one cares about a 1-10 leveling video
---
Correct.
---
But you're underestimating the value of movement speed, especially over long distances. So I would definitely recommend getting your mounts.
---
Also, mounts don't cast mana to cast.
---
#showtooltip
---
/use Frostbolt(Rank 1)
---
It should work normally. Then you can add fancy conditions and targeting in between use and frostbolt. If you just want to downrank though you don't need macros you can just use the spell from your book directly.
---
Genius
---
Because for some people leveling is boring AF and they already explored the same areas dozen of times back in the day (and in private servers) and they simply do not like leveling so they do it the fastest way possible ? 
---
This is a huge mmo, why the fuck do you care so much about how people did things a certain way ?
---
Stop gatekeeping.
---
As a side note for the programmatically interested, Erlang has had this capacity since 1986, ie hot reloading of code. A major reason why phones work at all!
---
Instance caps. People only ran 6-7 players to avoid instance caps. Today a meleecleave with 3 ravager warrs or 4 mage spellcleaves can still clear a dungeon in next to the same pace, but obviously a bit slower and therefore the XP/HR is diminished slightly.
---
Yeah fuck that quest. Spent over an hour with a guildie and a random guy doing it. Each one of us was missing a different weapon, so we went around killing every single one with free for all and it still took ages.
---
I doubt theres as many school kids playing classic wow as you think.
---
It's a combination of a few things. It's been out for a week and many people played a lot during that week, so now they're chilling a bit and playing normally. A lot of the really harecore players would have taken time off work last week to play all day, and now they're back in the office. Theres also people who saw the hype and tried it out, then realised that it isn't for them and they prefer retail or other games entirely. Kids going back to school probably does contribute too.
---
I loved the acheivements.  It gave me fun little challenges to do in between questing and other stuff.  It also gave fun little targets and extra challenges to keep people entertained.
---
Acheivements really added to the game for me. End game raiding is not the be all for everyone.
---
Probably not much gold given the game is basically brand new and most people ain't all that rich. I have an irl friend who has it capped at 125 on level 18 or 19.
---
I thought this was just initial server quirks, but someone said it was spellbatching in action. If this is here to stay i think im gonna go slightly mad, constant delay feels superbad.
---
Asmongold and many other streamers are nothing but children in adult bodies. That's why they are popular on twitch in the first place.
---
Blood Elves were a logical progression.  Draenei were kind of a retcon--to say nothing of the sudden appearance of Naaru.
---
Levelling as a prot, I couldn't agree more.
---
Ohhh I get it now, you're a metal-head and a hardcore-gamer
---
the class fantasy and identity is really strong in wow classic\vanilla, that's a big factor for me, even though many specs are undertuned and\or flawed compared to retail.
---
It's fun and refreshing to play a Warcraft RPG again, honestly.

---
I dont really see what you are talking about, asmongold has been playing more casually than most. why not condem the people that have been abusing layering and 10 man exp
---
Not everyone will be interested in doing naxx or even AQ, its like when people say theres no content in bfa but havent finished current raid in mythic. People who havent got time for those things will hit their wall sooner
---
Joke's on you, I already played vanilla several times in the past few years. And it was more authentic than Classic. What we got here is a shell of what it could have been.
---
Thank you so much will give this a try :)
---
I’ve been collecting linen cloth I’m just not sure what to make with it to level tailoring
---
you should check out the community manager like Bex form GGG how acitive she is and some important bug or expoits are fixed in literally no time after the community is abusing it or telling to do so.
---
They exploited a bug and got away with it. It's even on their Twitch VODs, 7-8 man raids in ZF, etc.
---
well played sir
---
and we all love you for it
---
Windows key + shift + S
---
I agree that the loot is much more rewarding in classic while leveling, but i cant agree that the leveling experience (the questing in particular) is more engaging. 
---
You can only pull one thing at a time, cast your 2-3 spells and then just auto-hit to death. In the mean time I get so bored that i redirect my attention to my second monitor cause i just have to wait 15 seconds till the mob is finally dead until I pull the next one and the whole things repeats. When you die, you at least have a few minutes where you can watch a video while your char auto-walks to your body. Its not that engaging imo. Could become better in higher levels but I dont know for certain and its already becoming a chore to get there in the first place. For now i cant do more than a level a day before I get way too bored. 
---
Difficulty does not equal time consuming to me. There is no amount of skill you can gain to lvl faster, it only takes time
---
But as long as people enjoy it, im not the one to stop them.
---
it's still dumb though
---
it's not "retail" players, it's not "vanilla" players. IT'S WORLD OF WARCRAFT player. Stop dividing people when we all like the same franchise and game. WOW players again get to play the game they wanted to play and on top of that EVERYONE gets a freebie game/boost if they reach 60lvl, which means more "retail" players will be playing classic for a longer period, which makes it more fun for you "classic" player/fan. It's a win win for everyone, free stuff literally has no bad sides.
---
I don't disagree that any exploit usage should have a penalty. I am just arguing that people might not have known it was an exploit (I personally didn't know untill the bluepost)
---
Create lvl 1 char and walk to the closest mailbox. Whenever your bags are getting full with stuff you intend to keep just mail it to your alt. If you need it you can mail it back.
---
Could i technically use the first half of that to delete my surplus of soul shards by checking for sould shards when pressing the button?
---
Mad bitch
---
It's the norm when you are geared and have figure out how to play a game. AoE pulling may be efficient but it's boring as hell to watch people do. 
---
If people want to do it to cheese leveling then whatever, but EVERYONE is obsessed with it. They won't do a run without it for some people.
---
i had a shaman send me silver for letting him know he didnt need to walk everywhere until 40 ... didnt even need to ask, just found a mail with a letter and come silver
---
Don't know about others but I never encountered those people. I play on EU flamelash.
---
I find it interesting that noone has commented on the first line of text tbh. That dude just kissed a Dick!
---
I soloed it years after. Feels like i missed parts of the experience
---
People keep arguing about this as if there server was the only server.
---
On Sargeras (which I’ve played since release and still do in BFA) it is and always has been VC. 
---
If it is/isn’t the same on you’re server, cool, it literally does not matter. 
---
But this is the internet so being impartial/not using anecdotal evidence as 100% infallible proof just doesn’t happen.
---
I'm on EU Skullflame. Warrior. I suck and my "friends" all levelled up and left me behind. Got a few dungeons to do. Looking for some casuals  to hang with.
---
I really like that, can see it's based on ElvUI. I'll get configuring mine tonight whilst fishing.
---
Yes, the delusional clown pointed out how you’ve been gamed. Of course you’re still having fun with it. You’re proving my point. Hold this L. Night sweetheart.
---
Using your laptop as a coaster is giving me PTSD
---
This is a core mechanic.its embarassing that blizz let it get into live
---
I use the same monitor but my second monitor is 60hz, and the difference is very noticeable when switching between the two monitors. I'm probably more sensitive to it but I cannot go back to 60hz even for WoW. It just feels so slow and awful compared to the buttery smooth 165hz. I'd MUCH rather take a cheapo 1080p TN 120hz over any 5k 60hz monitor.
---
Thank goodness. I hated seeing all the powerleveling groups becoming the new norm for leveling.
---
All those add-ons and nothing for your bags?
---
savant is a nice name
---
Wait until person dies and kill mob for your quest
---
Now everyone but mages are fucked. GGs!
---
free shit ahahahah fuck you. it has no value. it’s literal free shit.
---
500k might be a low estimate this year too with beta and classic release.
---
And the idea that that lifestyle and the money you make doing nothing wouldn't change one's personality .. nonsense
---
Me, because they exploited the XP bug to clear all of the content and claimed world first which technically isn't legit due to them exploiting their way to lvl 60, and Blizzard aren't doing anything because it's Classic?
---
K
---
Not a Nerf its a fix, i'd argue.
---
Dire Maul didn't even exist when we started the running the DM
---
I did a complete run of WC yesterday just to get 4 deviate hides. Had the group I was in been tossers I would have left as soon as I had what I needed. However, they weren't tossers and the run was seriously fun. :)
---
This means a lot considering those Fortitudes eat all my mana, you’re welcome stranger 💛
---
For dps-classes that's true. But for Tanks or Healers I feel you should have made it to a dungeon to get a proper feeling about the class as your playstyle there differs dramatically from what you do when alone.
---
As someone who spent 2 and a half hours running around Gnomer last night — thanks for this, I hope I never have to use it
---
I always pets and minions
---
not on alliance at least
---
I love shooting them with Viper Sting when I run past them. Nothing else. Just a mana draining sting.
---
The post has been removed. This is unconfirmed.
---
If im in bear form I wasnt a macro this shifts out and back and in push. This is a macro that did work, I used it. It allows you to get out of roots, cat dps...ect...
---
I'm at 3 days played and I'm level 28. Feelsbadman
---
It's a minority that abused it - the percentage of people in the over lvl 40 level bracket is tiny and a good chunk of them still didn't raid farm.
---
Not like you can't have multiple characters.
---
Just rush the main so you can get advantage of low traffic in high value areas and then enjoy the game more slowly on alts.
---
What about 40 mounts? Do u know if pp makes good money?
---
What are you gona do when being camped. Log out and watch TV? Queue times say no :(
---
No mana breaks, only healer that needs mana.
---
Warriors deals a lot of dmg and can take a hit or two. With a melee group all mobs are in one place so cleaving/swiping strikes makes most dungeons a breeze. Gear won’t be an issue as you run the dungeon many times so you can expect loot to drop multiple times.
---
Look at the AQ20 loot table :)
---
Stratholme Syndrome
---
I've been GM in different MMO's before, it's fun isn't it? I'm not doing that ever again, takes way to much time and effort to deal with those dipshits.
---
Just go to a different realm tbh. Join a fun guild, don't make your own.
---
I had that yesterday evening but honestly it was a relief. No paranoia about queue and I've been feeling like shit after all weekend so nice break.
---
Yea I can agree with that. You can jump into RFC at 13 and test that out tho
---
Your not, I've had to group with my wife every time we've traded something in game in SW, and we have been guided since the start. I get the need for layering, but it does suck.
---
I mean I know assassins have good camouflage but literally becoming the ground is amazing.
---
That's correct, no filthy casuls. There'll be a written exam in the starter area to judge your worthiness.
---
Which is 2 bag spaces :)
---
Don't worry, the water will make it to the turtle in a few years.
---
I love doing it while watching a tv show
---
It's because individual servers for realms and instances aren't a thing any more. It's cloud computing. This why sharding, phasing, layering and cross-realm grouping works.
---
The actual hardware hosting your character and world changes constantly.
---
So they can roll a hotfix through by shifting the active world load around to different hardware, applying updates as processors become idle.
---
Slow sword main hand and fast dagger or sword off hand.
---
vanilla is all about pvp.
---
I absolutely love having all of the abilities and spell ranks. Having full bars is great and I completely agree that each class has it's own identity. In retail, every class has the same abilities just with different names and visuals. Feels so bland.
---
Lists a ton of changes? Did you even read the post?
---
This is what I'm doing:
---
1) Start with Skinning (additional cash) and Tailoring (bags/equip)
---
2) Get to lv60
---
3) Craft Robes of Archmage (BiS for a long while)
---
3) When you start having some decent cash, drop Skinning for Engineering (useful for PvP)
---
4) (Optional) You're not forced to be a tailorer once you get your robe. You can drop it for something else (Herbalism/Mining/Enchanting/etc).
---
Double debuff wasnt until 1.7....
---
Also really the changes in 1.1.2 do not look that big.
---
We were doing WC yesterday and our tank DC'd, so i had to sub in as the tank... as a hunter.
---
We couldn't beat Verdan until a second healer joined in and managed to keep me alive. 
---
It was actually fun because hunter gets to parry and dodge a bit, and i can keep aggro with the taunt shot. But when you have 650 hp and take 300 hits in the face by the boss, oh boi.
---
Cooking gives you a variety of decent buffs. For a little time investment it helps a bit. It isn't game changing so if you don't enjoy it don't worry about it
---
Fly, you fools!
---
Best part is that Lock just keeps getting better and better.
---
Has a rough run in WC where someone accidentally triggered the escort and fucked the dungeon. I fished for about an hour after gathering deviant fish to destress. I love fishing now.
---
I play a gnome mage and I picked up tailoring and enchanting but haven’t got a secondary yet, is fishing and cooking good for money? Or do people just use them for food? As a mage that won’t be very useful as they can conjure food when they need too.
---
Nope, give it a bit for them to farm out full MC gear and they’ll be out “looking for a fight”. So many people claim to love world PvP but really only like it when they’re crazy overpowered compared to most other players.
---
Big same, there's a few folks who can't seem to understand the naming policy but for the most part everyone is chill
---
3 days played. Level 28.
---
For context, I was walking around trying to finish a quest in redridge,  and I kept entering combat and taking damage. When I finally looked down theres a fuckin gnoll in the ground stabbing me in the feet as I walked by. 100 sneak.
---
This man fishes
---
You're welcome! I knew someone would appreciate waterbreathing in the Barrens after all :)
---
go look for floating debris - rare stuff in those.
---
I'm doing fishing on second screen while I'm working on the primary monitor. Just shift-click over when I hear a splash.
---
This is what he said
---
&gt;Kennymarch is not in the Method guild iirc, he is in a hardcore pserver guild (Progress) and it just someone who is signed by the Method company as a streamer, not by the Method guild as a WoW player
---
It is slow, granted.  But IMO, it's a great way to take a breather after turning in a whole list of quests and grinding out whatever you're currently doing. Not to mention, if you stick with it, it will eventually make you a decent amount of gold. Not many people have the patience to max it out, so you can end up with some valuable catches.
---
Is this one US? I've been playing nonstop all weekend on one of the biggest EU servers and not a single crash.
---
As a Paladin I always did, and am still now, ignoring fishing, cooking and first aid. I kinda feel whats the point when I can just hit a button and get my health back. What we need is a drinking skill - how to make your own delicious varieties of ales, fine wines and vodka  that pumps up the mana!
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
That isn’t a guild, it’s a collection if spurgs. Good guilds tend to have actual recruitment procedures. Website, applications, recruitment officers, etc. this sounds more like you were taking anyone, and expected it to work out perfectly. Notice how good guilds tend to have a core group of people that have gamed together for years? Those people network a bit, and tend to attract other players who fit the mold. If you’re inviting your buddies little brother just because.. what did you expect? That he would be a champ? Get real.
---
You could try it for quests but highly contested quests probably have the same thing happening in every layer.
---
Offer to pay him. Then he can be a full time wagemage.
---
Still not gay.... but...
---
I always understood the argument against it but figured it was better than the alternative. I think about it a lot though. I leveled to lvl 15, seeing the same people from my layer again and again. Then I joined a friends party, so I could trade him a bag and I was moved to another layer with completely different people. I wrote someone I had just been in a party with if he/she could invite me back to my old layer and they did. But now I'm constantly aware of it. I don't know if I get a new layer every time I log on or if it tries to keep me on the same layer but it's making me a bit paranoid of accidentally leaving my layer by being invited. It's one of the reasons I haven't done my first Dead Mines run yet.
---
I’m also a priest wondering this. You can still heal dungeons well with no points in holy til 60?
---
Me everday
---
You are making the claim and you are supposed to back your claim.
---
I found a green wizard hat for my Tauren... It looked weird. My character looked like a fat Harry Potter.
---
Both classes have good pros and cons.
---
Shaman has good utility and buffs with totems, as well as ghost wolf form.
---
Warlock can teleport people which is incredibly useful and fun. Lock also has soulstones and healthstones. Can't say what else atm since I'm only lv30.
---
Probably means that they play the modern game, up to bfa. You can play everything up to bfa without purchasing anything other than a subscription I think.
---
&gt; You have been able to update databases in production since forever
---
No I haven't.
---
Anyone want to play Mario Land?
---
It is
---
Only the GUI of WoW is LUA.
---
90% of the groups I’ve been in don’t say a word and leave when they are done. Eh at least we group up..
---
It’s definitely not the same for everyone 😅
---
Professions are so fun in vanilla. I took herb and alchemy, and being able to craft my own supplies has made things so much more enjoyable. I don't just see herbs in the wild as "oh look, here's x gold/silver" anymore. They're now supplies that will help me get through leveling easier
---
Whoa thats a whole quarter level right there lol
---
All that raw fish you fish.. there's a recipe for that. Fishing is by far the easiest way to level up cooking.
---
As a Warlock I had fun with the challenge of seeing how many mobs I could pull with my Eye of Kilrogg. It was like a mini game! I felt like the all star of the group.
---
The first iPhone released in 2007 I think, so at best it would’ve been a flip phone or something. But yeah I think part of it is that it’s much easier to shoot and upload from your phone than screenshot, crop etc.
---
Reminds me of the other night, grouped in ashenvale to run the cave with the bear escort, we rolled for a chest I won, grabbed a nice level 17 and 2h agi axe and carried in focus killing mobs, I realised a guy from my party whispered me asking for the axe I said I’d sell it and carried on, coming to the end he kept asking how much so I just threw out a “idk 1g” still trying to focus keeping people healed and dpsing 
---
He responded something shitty and kicked me from the group, glad I dodged that toxic friendship haha
---
Sounds like an awfully advanced feature. Why don't you volunteer to make it then?
---
Totally agree retail feels like everyone is the same... with different visuals. 
---
I understand homogenaisation but I think that stemmed from the problem that 10/25 raid sizes brought. Less classes meant less classes bringing whatever utility they had. 
---
If they stuck to the 25 man model and didn’t bring in 10 man/flex raids we still have a lot of the uniqueness the classes had
---
For higher ranks of claw and screech, you'll have to train other pets who innately have the ability. Then you need to use the newly tamed pet until "you" learn the ability (shows up in chat) so you can teach it to your other pets. Growl, armor, stamina, resistances all come from your pet trainer instead. Petopia is a great reference for all things pet related.
---
Hard capped in with a beta patch.
---
You can save a lot of time by not rushing to it. Basically, the first time you get to Menethil to go to Darkshore, you actually stop by Theramore and get the flying path. At some point at level ~18, you will be doing the Lighthouse quests on Westfall, so you can use the chance to swim to Booty Bay and get that FP as well. Take the boat and take Ratchet's FP.
---
There are two Ashenvale quests (one coming from Darkshore) that are done in the same area, so at this point you have all the required FPs. You do Menethil-&gt;Theramore-&gt;Ratchet, go to the Barrens, quest giver (leave by the side if you don't want to paint a big crosshair on yourself), go back to Ratchet, fly to Astranaar, stop by Maestra's Post and do all three quests at the same time. 
---
This way you barely waste any time, get important FPs, etc. You can't fly from Ratchet to Astranaar without Theramore's FP.
---
The other option is to skip Succubus until level 40, as you have to stop by Ratchet for the mount anyways, so you can just ride to Crossroads. Horde won't attack you (they are 20-25 levels lower than you) and then you can fly to Astranaar, as you will have Theramore's FP already. 
---
Note: I'm struggling to remember if you need Theramore's FP to do Ratchet -&gt; Astranaar or not.
---
This would be really big for my swifty macro lol. I'll test it tomorrow
---
&gt;  I really don't know why blizz added this mechanic
---
It wasn't in the beta at first, so the community strongly asked for it and Blizzard listened.
---

Here's an example of Fire Mage talents in retail WoW currently, they are more impactful individually than Classic talents but you only get that to pick from. You also get a completely different set of talents if you spec Frost or Arcane, and you can't use spells from other specs (no frostbolt or cone of cold for fire mages)
---
Yeah but a original ram would be a bit more rare. So i might go that route for that reason
---
Jumping is not enough, neither is auto-running + jumping. You need to move around to not be kicked.
---
Go to your skills page and hit the cancel button next to it. If you stop your profession you have to start over
---
We want the old unstuck teleport! #nochanges. Totally unplayable in this state!
---
^/s
---
That knoll is a weeb hes been watching naruto to much and thinks he can do earth style jutsu
---
stop wasting water plz
---
I think you answered your own question.
---
Do you know when this changed in classic to guess when we will be getting that change?
---
Playing classes instead of specs is indeed great.
---
Ah now i see what you meant. Its not 200% tho. Pull time is the same. Run speed of you and the mobs is the same. Drinking/eating after a fight is the same. There will also be people that deal significantly less dmg than others, they wouldnt be in your grp if you 5man. Its nitpicky but you wont have double the xp gain.
---
I remember back in the day they could hotfix spells but the tooltips wouldn't update until the next major patch. Would cause awkward scenarios where your spell tooltip reads one way but actually works differently.
---
Put the menu bar under your chat window and we have pretty much the same UI. I like your style ;)
---
What do you mean he asked if he can get items that he ***NEEDS*** , oh BOY am I BOILING NOW
---
I’m leveling Engineering and Mining as a hunter. Being able to make my own ammo, explosives and guns while leveling is great.
---
It's a trade off for being the slowest levelers in the game.
---
Why would want punishment as reward of hitting lvl 60? Makes no sense.
---
I play a Priest in Retail and Classic.
---
In Retail while leveling I bind SW:P to my mousewheel and tabspam while walking through a zone dotting everything with a healthbar. Up until BfA content, everything dies before it reaches me. Even in BfA content, I can't actualy die even if mobs manage to get to me. 
---
In Classic I know I can pull 3 Hillsbrad Peasants at a time if I kite appropriately and rotate my Psychic Scream so that enemies are never feared while I have the Weakened Soul debuff on myself and some amount of PW:S remaining. I know if I pull 4, I have to drink a potion to kill all 4 and if I do so I have to sit and drink back to full mana (Even through Spirit Tap, which generally keeps me mostly topped off if I keep optimal uptime and dont overlap the buff and waste it)
---
5 Peasants, or even 3 and a Defender is death no matter what I do, even if I play my best.
---
But, if I want to zone out and watch youtube I always have the option of just pulling 1 at a time.
---
The only times you have to look away from YouTube in Retail is during a boss pull on Normal and up (in appropriate gear) and if you're pushing a M+ key for IOscore, and your rewards for doing so is a piece of gear you don't know the name of.
---
My personal favorite thing to do in Classic is to help guildies, and in Retail that isn't really a thing you can do because crafting is so awful, nobody ever needs help to quest, and dungeons are generally either "Free Loot" or "Instawipe" difficulty if you bring a less skilled buddy aside from raids, and raids have a lockout.
---
Now if only Vanilla had some Ulduar-style Hardmodes when it released in 2004. That'd be the dream-game tbh.
---
I currently have Bartender4 and Questie
---
also it depends if you want to have fun playing games with your friend does it matter that duo leveling is or is not slower? i think it can still be faster then solo leveling but it is definitely more fun to duo level with a friend. get your ass on discord or another chat program and just have fun together going through the game isn't that what makes gaming fun? solo leveling in my opinion is quite boring and its a lot better with friends on discord and doing dungeon's together and ripping through the world together.
---
If you're Horde and can wear leather check out the quest chain on Hunter's Rise in TB that leads to the quest Frostmaw. Can be done before level 30 (37 mob, so need a group) and rewards a nice leather hat with agi and spirit.
---
uhhhhhhhhh
---
Idk aren’t most of these made up? Just tell em you added them as a friend and say you had fun...
---
Less abilities that you actually use for pve dps is what they probably mean.
---
You are really, really wrong. At least for 30-40 for Horde the best leveling zone was STV which was infested with Alliance camping hubs 24/7. If you were Alliance you got to enjoy going wherever you wanted and questing worry free. Horde don't have jack shit otherwise (Desolace has like 12 quests that give you maybe one level).
---
Get one of the dwarf masks from the Halloween event and then try again, but in disguise!

---
Elvui mainly, some minor changes since this one, removed bar 3 from the left side of my main bar.
---
It is a healing oriented setup so having everything in the middle is pretty nice. Raid/party frames fill from the bottom in the "raid" window
---
Probably something weaker than goku was used to lock that
---
after i have begged for hundreds of g to send to my alt
---
Oh god, me too. I always thought it's a frog.
---
Because retail raiding takes some skill and Classic literally just about spending time?
---
i just kill every undead on sight
---
A tortoise is a type of turtle. Perhaps he just needed a drink.
---
That doesn't make the game more casual. It makes it simpler and easier to obtain equipment.
---
That is only a mindset if you cannot see anything beyond equipment. Which is really short sighted because equipment is not all the game.
---
Any general tips for someone who wants to start learning how to do cool style art like this?
---
Or if you dont mind poiting me in the direction of what should i learn.
---
Thanks!
---
Your art is really cool congrats!
---
I took annual leave at the wrong time it seems - merely lvl 10 and feck all profs so far!
---
delicate balance between retail and classic to farm wow tokens
---
They didn't. They never even considered it. 
---
The original functionality was never on the table.
---
If people talked about it, it was hearsay or wishful thinking.
---
Hey man, it's super tough working on the same game and nothing new for almost a decade.
---
So its not hard to build a house from scratch either? after all it only takes time.. or training your body to be as fit and strong as possible isnt hard, all it takes is time and dedication.
---
Putting that single point in Anger Management was more satisfying than anything I've done on BfA in the last year
---
Not for a paladin :D Even then though, smart money management can radically reduce the additional time you need to get the mount without professions. It also depends on what those professions are. Lots of variables.
---
100 g for the mount + 20 g for riding
---
If you get the max discount with your desired faction, mount costs go down to 80g. Riding is still the same though.
---
you can actually do this with a macro doesn't mean he is botting. but its still deplorable.
---
I'm new, what are professions useful for?
---
Have you ever done a mythic bfa raid? the last few bosses are insanely difficult. They are not easy for anyone.
---
It's what I did. Might come back when I am lv 18.
---
That's true. And i did find the "race" fun (even though it wasn't really a race I guess). The impressive part is really just the ability to stay awake for long periods of time though. The reason i wouldn't call it impressive is because anyone could do it if they decided to sleep 3 hours a night and play WoW non stop for the first week.
---
Hmmmmm I don’t think it would be question
---
Yup, it doesn't work at all. Blizzard fix this shit!!!
---
Experienced warrior looking for a leveling partner all the way to 60, got my route perfected all you need to bring is 12h+ a day and your class and we'll be 60 in a week. EU Alliance, any server.
---
One of your bartender bars is in that position. You’ll need to go into bartender settings and fix it.
---
it's a problem
---
Probably Warlock or paladin
---
no.
---
Wow I am unlucky. Had it multiple times when others were stealing Mob, I already started a cast on without getting any invites at all.
---
Now I am using moonfire to tag everything myself first.
---
Got ganked by a Rogue, nearly died. Then he got Ganked by 2 rogues who said i looked like bait... So they followed me around in stealth.
---
BLZ has been greedy. With the launch of every new patch the new stuffs negate  the old, making your previous efforts pointless. It turns you into a Syssiphus rolling a boulder uphill, and when you're about to reach the top, the boulder slips and fall down to the bottom, and you have to do it all over again. Vanilla is wonderful and impressive in this regard, many gears are unique in their own ways and can be useful from MC to Naxx. Honestly, BLZ could've done a much better job at gear itemization. They could've designed more gears that have a chance on hit effect, a usable ability, some class specific weapons that improves one particular ability, or some temporary gears that can only be equipped in some zones or some occasion. But no, you have none of these. It's just the same stats piling up higher and higher. Nothing iconic and nothing fun.
---
&gt;putting in a cool down on switching layers 
---
This is a really good idea. I see way too much "Invite for new layer pls" in my guild chat atm. Imagine a 30min cooldown on switching layers.
---
Preferably two handed, slow attack speed for big damage with moongoose bite and also stats because you will be shooting most of the time anyways. Agility and stamina primarily.
---
No it's not made up, not everything on the internet is fake. It's a genuine letter from a fellow adventurer.
---
They all 6+ manned all the way from 44 to 60, that's halfways of the entire leveling process. This easily shaved a day off the clear time.
---
Like on New Year’s Eve how no one in the crowd had a clue who Ninja was?
---
?
---
or DME, DMW, etc... which is what i remember doing

CALL HIS NAME AND SAVE HIM FROM THE DARK!

He'd more interested in equal heights rather than equal rights

I am not German no, Scottish for what it's worth.
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/BEcYNtr.png) is how you play a warlock on retail (in demonology spec). On Classic, you press shadow bolt. You do use a lot more abilities for dps in retail on every class.
---
imagine giving birth to something that posts this, yikes
---
Europe based player on Noggenfogger.  I'm a horde player, warlock. From the Netherlands. I'm looking for a guild with a cool name that helps new players with content but is also planning to do end game content. Send me a message if that sounds like your guild :)
---
Dungeon finder back in 3.2 was at least on your own server IIRC. This is why i think people shot their load early with the LFG addon in classic.
---
Think about what the classic LFG addon is actually doing. Its compiling instances of people saying LFG, then putting it all clearly for you to see. Thats it.
---
It isn't cross server, it isn't auto inviting you, it isn't teleporting you inside or even near the dungeon and so on. You still have to whisper the leader and ask for an invite.
---
But classic streamers, people with 10,000 viewers trading them gold while they 10 man scarlet monestary, are saying it isn't in the spirit of classic.
---
You fucking wot m8
---
41, rogue rougly 4 days  played
---
It is an excellent dungeon, many fond memories. I'm 2 levels from it myself. 
---
I would recommend level 18-19 for it though, you can always come back once you've leveled a bit more.
---
Just stats, agi, spirit, stamina. You will barely ever melee so you just want whatever gives the most stats to increase your bow damage.
---
You can steal the tags if you actually do some damage to them you'll get the tags after a couple of seconds, it doesnt just automatically instantly transfer over to you.
---
They may enable free transfers off of the extremely overpopulated realms to low pop ones.
---
It may take a while before they do this, as they need to gauge the population of classic in the long term. They're not interested in having many low pop realms and having to merge them together later.
---
I would q
---
You made my fucking day mate
---
It's funny as well because the same people who criticized retail for being "Just a dungeon spam where you AoE everything" are the ones who have been abusing this method the most.
---
I was so hyped when I heard Draenei were the new race in TBC and was so confused when they looked nothing like they did in WC3.
---
That one video of the parody of Hitler is actually pretty accurate for this situation
---
indeed would be good to know which server you are playing on.
---
I called myself Phatboi, and someone rejected me joining a guild cos of my name, I love RP and seeing it happen, and then I joined a Guild called Boory Bay Bullies, so what's to say my name wasnt relevant to that guild as Phatboi the booty bay bully who's a little fat dwarf and that's my RP nickname?
---
What do you say to this? As the story is perfectly viable and has nothing to do with you, maybe you should question people before reporting them.
---
I come from Defias Brotherhood on retail too
---
uh i meant stockades
---
Bartender is the issue you have to click the bartender dot on your mini map.  After that you can move and hide bars and lock their locations
---
Yeah. Connections help a ton too,
---
Like father, like son

Warriors and mages are the two classes that I always go out of my way to give a healthstone to. Theyre always so appreciative!

Warlock!!
---
Played bfa few weeks, played a few months here and there before that a few years long. Started playing classic on release after not touching retail for about 8 months.
---
Loving it, no desire to hop back to retail at the moment
---
Ah gotcha. I'm doing alliance cause iv mainly played horde for the past 10 or so years. Was looking for a different experience :)
---
I think you need to play Guild Wars 2.
---
I was trying a NE druid yesterday and could not use Shadowmeld in combat. 
---
Did I miss something?
---
Otherwise what would be the use case for this racial?
---
Never played WoW before. 
---
I'm a level 10 Dwarf Hunter, I've just got a Boar as my first pet - no idea why, just decided to use a Boar, hopefully I chose ok?
---
I have a talent to select and I'm overwhelmed by the choices and I'm worried about messing it up due to the future cost of respec talents, I havent selected anything for now.
---
Any advice?
---
Ya it’s fun but some quests are very tedious. My first time playing WOW altogether and I like the setting and just the look of it. I’m an undead warlock and so far it’s fun enough. If I enjoy it the rest of the month I’ll keep subscribing
---
Hm. I think "fixed" might be more appropriate.
---
You guys being the ones who question their "world first" click bait attempt without understanding the concept behind it. 
---
Very few people making these comments do not hate method and actually cheer for them in the proper world first races, they just like seeing the little guy win sometimes.
---
My "manliness" isn't nearly as easily threatened by yours it seems.
---
You play the game to have fun not to stress about something. Just roll what you want and go with it. Ask them to come to you if they need you that bad.
---
Paladin won't work as a tank at the endgame because we have no taunt.
---
Slow MH/fast OH. 
---
Sometimes you have to grind in between questing blocks.
---
Just copy the installation to a flashdrive and youre good to go!
---
Does any of my fellow druid bois know a good addon (even moreso unit frames) that tracks your mana while in feral forms? Preferably also energy ticks?
---
How exactly is an official wc3 hero a meme? I don't like MoP but no need to come up with false arguments because you don't know Warcraft very well.
---
As hunter I rarely died doing all those big dungeons and people hated me for it 😆
---
Glad this fix came earlier rather than later. Don't want to get into higher level dungeons with people who can only play well with 9 others in the instance.
---
Lol, why do you care so much how other people are enjoying the game? You really let their playstyle dictate how much you enjoy the game?
---
You might be expecting a detailed answer, but my honest advice is don't worry about min maxing and take a few minute to look down each talent tree and decide to start pumping points in to whichever one you think you would enjoy the most. The point of playing the game is to enjoy it. Play whatever way you will be happy with. If you feel you made a mistake, you can just respec and earn your money back. Classic is about the journey, not the destination. But, if you really want to make sure you're doing top dps, then google some classic hunter guides and follow their talents and get whichever pets they tell you to. Whatever floats your boat my dude.
---
If you're with the Horde, you can go do the Ragefire Chasm in the middle of Orgrimmar around level 13. 
---
For Alliance, you can do the Wailing Caverns at ~15, but if you don't want to travel to the Barrens, you'll need to hold out to about ~17 to do the Deadmines. 
---
(You can theoretically enter all of these dungeons on level 10 if you find a group who'll take you, the levels I've given are just the recommended ones.)
---
Levelling only through dungeons is from then on definitely possible, but it might take a while to find a group depending on your class/server. 
---
I don't really know about BGs, sorry about that.
---
The fun doesn't start. The whole game is pain.
---
it’s fully ironic lol
---
I'm really enjoying it. This is my first time ever playing WoW, and it's great. I love that you can't quick travel, gear feels important and professions actually seem to matter. Just got to 20 with my Gnome Warlock, did the epic trek to get my succubus, which made it feel that more earned and worthwhile.
---
Was it also reported? Or do you think Blizzard employees are watching streams all day?
---
&gt; Well of course they weren't gonna have flasks and top end enchant 5 day
---
You completely missed the point. I'm not slacking them off or anything. 
---
I'm just saying when most guilds start MC they'll have better gear and more consumables.
---
i spent 3 hrs yesterday farming RFK for corpsemaker, finally got it lol.
---
Ahh okay that makes sense then.
---
I raided SFK (lol) Stratholme Scholo Ubrs Lbrs and BRD all in 10 or 15 man groups in vanilla.
---
.
---
You just had to drop group to pick up quest objectives if I remember cireectly
---
What server and region are you in? RP or RPPVP server?
---
They also have considerably higher armour, can block, parry and have higher health pools.
---
In other words, you are able to speed level 4 classes and the rest will need to level normally before you can raid successfully.
---
The world first 60 didn’t even use dungeons
---
Come to grob!
---
That mouse macro is run by third party software, using third party software to perform actions in the game without player input is the definition of botting.
---
Will stuff like the early cloths/leather eventually become more expensive? In retail during BC they definitely were.
---
The coolest random little thing that has happened to me so far was doing an escort quest.... for a player. Ran into a level 18 on the road to booty bay and she asked me if I could escort her. Got paid 10s for it at the end too.
---
Fantastic work dude, nice to have them all in one place.
---
Aspire E 15, i5 7200U, 940MX geforce, 8g ram, 512 SSD
---
I buff them Int because everyone likes a smart tank.
---
That’s awesome! This is the type of thing that makes a community work. You made wow a little better for everyone, thank you for being cool.
---
Why does anyone care what Asmongold does. It's so fucking easy to just not watch his stream and play on a different server. It's that easy. I mean holy shit what makes him obligated to play exactly how you want??
---
Not yet, because one command is /cast and the other is /cancelaura, and I don't know how to switch between these with a modifier.
---
Not everyone is a fan of ganking lowbies or getting fucked by zergs.
---
*crits from behind*
---
Same! Dude hell yeah grats on that.
---
Maybe the screenshot was taken with a disposable camera, sent for development, then scanned, then uploaded to the internet.
---
Since I couldn't give buffs as a Shaman, I did this and rezzed any dead people I saw. Was more rewarding than I imagined.
---
The drinks ain’t free cuz, and res is like half a mana bar, I’ve done it a few times just so I can assert my alpha male dominance and call people bad for dying. But if you die it’s on you enjoy your time as a ghost.

You sound incredibly jealous and bitter. He doesn't affect your life - ignore him.
---
You should have got it from the final step in your pet training quests at level 10.
---
This may help: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php
---
well you're not playing a dark iron dwarf tho, just like you're not playing a gurubashi troll or a blackrock orc. That said tho their city looks fairly prosperous so you're probably right anyways.
---
I think asmon is still correct. If method was serious about getting world first, they would simple hire the pserver guys and put them along side their main team under the method brand name.
---
Is there an addon for finding these? I'm sure auctioneer had something like that at some point, but the one I found for classic doesn't.
---
Literally in the same boat. Got to level 36, am writing this at work now. Already want to log back in
---
Which is insanely stupid as phase 2 adds basically nothing of relevance and especially PvE players are fucked.
---
I'm gonna tell you now, it doesn't change. You'll be doing quests right up to 60 (which takes weeks, if not months for casual players) and then more quests at 60. 
---
I personally love adventuring with friends and grouping with new people to grind mobs or complete elite quests. 
---
My advice is to just relax and enjoy it, don't rush to 60. A lot of the fun in classic comes from the community and leveling is what you make of it. 
---
If you're still not enjoying yourself at 20, this isnt the game for you.
---
If someone loots, you can loot the quest reward after if they already have it.
---
You miss out on lots of fun moments if you live in a instance all the time.
---
Like the 5 level 22 to 28's that tried to attack me and my warrior buddy who were like level 32/33 at the time. Most intense battle i've had when your thinking these guys must be mad.
---
One does not prevent the other.
---
Met Rexxar yesterday as well. Although I was quite in a hurry due to the fact that I was level 24 and only in Desolace for the Cooking book in Shadowprey
---
As long as there's no quality of life, ease of use, convenience tools which trivialise the journey and kill the magic of the world... then "maybe"...
---
Please give me an example of a place on earth where you can't find 'toxic' people.

It's just part of humanity and you just gotta deal with it and most of the time ignore it.

PvP
---
Theres so many youtube channels dedicated to obsessing over everything he does.
---
&gt; As someone who played LoL I have never seen this before.
---
Not sure what the relevance of that is lmao. Tons of things have been accidentally leaked early by accident from official sources in the video game industry.  But as someone else said, the image was faked so it doesn't really matter.
---
be sure to invite us to your wedding.
---
People don't understand that aggro is a mechanic. Its also not a huge deal in lower level dungeons. People will learn in later dungeons as they get killed due to this shit. You can also always tell them to stop and explain things will be faster if mobs aren't running all over the place
---
I definitely have leanings towards Warlock after the flip. My concern though is that since I have no experience is classic wow, I am basing the decision purely on the character theme and not how the character actually plays. My major concern is getting to like level 40, realizing the warlock is pretty 'samey' and have to reroll. Think I might sleep on it, and if I still haven't made up my mind I will give  u/[HeisenbergTTV](https://www.reddit.com/user/HeisenbergTTV/) advice and try both for a couple of hours
---
I love throwing on a rejuv and a quick Mark of the Wild to peeps questing :)
---
When do warriors get a cleave or aoe? Isn't it about 40/45? I'm currently 18
---
What wow macro let's you do this? I didn't know wow macros could have delay timers and repeatability.
---
You can do multi mage 10mans? 
---
It's what Apes did to 60. They had a spellcleave group and just threw in an afk warrior to leech xp to 60.
---
In context, it's still a small number. There were billions of Night Elves at one point .
---
It was possible to do normal dungeons with 10 people in Vanilla. It was quite common for level 60 dungeons.
---
But .12 comes before 3. 1.3 is the dire maul patch.
---
yeah I just agrred with that LUUL
---
&gt;but he expected me to be like that and judged me
---
Did he though? Because from what you've described he asked you if you'd like to and you've put a whole load of assumptions around it.
---
Same boat, brother. I never really played WoW before. But I'm really enjoying this now that classic is out. I get to start fresh on the original game and learn everything with my friends.
---
RP events are such a bliss, especially since Classic doesn't come with scheduled events like in retail
---
Idk much about WoW backend but they definitely used Lua backends in other games like D3.
---
I stopped tanking in Retail because of the way people were. Thought I'd pick it up again in Classic and for the most part people have been decent, waited for me to get aggro, attacked the marked targets, etc.
---
I reckon the ones causing trouble are those that are still in the Retail mindset. I'm hoping they will either learn soon or go back to retail.
---
ofc
---
I know, but it's hard to fight the feeling and to accept that someone can remain untopped.
---
Classic is teaching me the hard way though so it's all good!
---
This is why I rolled war, and always keep a 1h+s spare, the extra armor of a shield helps even if all 1h are fast attacking (compared to my 3.3speed 2h axe
---
I used to do this when my brother and I had computers next to each other, never had an issue
---
Good job dude. I have a question about hunter pets. Say I have a cat pet currently named catone that didn’t come learned with prowl. So I go out and tame a cat that knows prowl rank 1 already and name him cattwo. Then I learn prowl rank 1, abandon my cattwo completely and teach my original catone prowl rank 1. Will catone be able to rank up prowl as he levels up? Or will I just have to tame a cat that already learned a prowl rank 3?
---
It won't,  not unless they do a development fork.
---
I know that. The problem was absolutely none of the items required were dropping at all.
---
Its a weird one because the game would massively change. I'm not at all against them opening a "classic+" style server to progress the game but I'd be against them changing this version of the game.
---
I believe wow is made on reworked warcraft engine
---
People only care for big Numbers on their dps meters and its super dumb... I always mark my mobs but they dont care for that. If an unmarked MOB walks towards the dps I just let iT go... and let the dps tank it.
---
What do you mean? Warriors have higher armour due to wearing mail and holding a shield increases this advantage considerably. They can also parry and block attacks to completely prevent or reduce damage.
---
They like doing world PvP and invitign their stream to camp horde and fuck with people, when people do it to them they rage.
---
It's rather simple. Streamers are hypocritical babies.
---
Was amazing and i had no idea what she was cooking for a solid 3 hours locked up in the kitchen xD
---
Good laptop but desktop will always be the way to go ;)
---
Not really faor if they fix it without punishing the people that exploited it is it? If you were caught exploiting back in Vanilla you definitely would have caught some kind of ban. Instead you now get to tun aroumd on your mount and bank gank from your I'll gotten goods I guess.
---
I’m nowhere near a computer but does /cast nomod:shift manashiled then
---
/cancelaura mod:shift manashield not work for this? 
---
I’ve never taken an interest in mages so by far not the best player to craft a macro for one up lol. There should be internet guides somewhere. Or create a new macro on an alternate binding that’s shift f or whatever key your manashield is on and take a space on a hot bar up. Same diff just not on one slot.
---
You're stimulating the economy and that players happiness. You're good in my book.
---
Don't listen to the naysayers saying vendor it.
---
He’s glad he dodged you
---
as a healer i sympathize, running WC i am so mana hungry and the tank/dps just kept pulling more and more i am pretty sure each pack size was getting bigger and bigger.  
---
we survived but it is not fun playing on the edge and risking death, repair bill and walking all the way back

I am more proud of you by a million times than the folks who downed rag.

I'm not a subscriber of his but I have tuned in a couple of times. He has a University degree doesn't he? Worked for the IRS. He actually seems very intelligent and yeah his attitude and persona is not to everyone's taste, but he seems like a nice person - he looks after his disabled mother for god's sake. I think people are just incredibly bitter and jealous. 
---
In fact, the ones saying he should be depressed and working in a grocery store are probably the one's who are actually depressed and not happy within themselves. Very sad.
---
And any threat increase is welcome.

If you want PvP you can never go wrong with rogue.

---
heh, i played during work on friday/saturday night.
---
i had to log out a couple times since actual work came in though.
---
Just try and get as high as possible.  Players are starting to reach level cap so they're going to need potions etc for endgame.  There will be a constant need for those types of things so that will be your chance to recoup costs.
---
10 man dungeon runs have been quite common at lvl 60. Not for Exp, tho.
---
windows button + shift + s. You get the selected area as an image in you clipboard, that you can paste directly to imgur.
---
That does seem the most likely.
---
The quests will lead you where you need to go.
---
How do you do this? I have Phillips Hue, but never heard of that option
---
Cool? Im talking about the rest of us mortals.
---
I always heard people say bfa rotations were dumbed down? Haven’t played since mop - but isn’t every class basically the same with a heal, an aoe, and single target etc these days?
---
Awesome to hear the naysayers are coming around! Classic wow shall live forever!!
---
This is common behavior for Quinja69, nothing new
---
That's the weird dichotomy, I've always seen casual players/midcore players call guilds that clear mythic raids "nolifers" when they spend double the raid days trying to clear things
---
If only there was a reason to not raidlog in MMOs in today's world though

---
&gt; with the downs being certain specs being completely incapable of raiding, pvp or even levelling
---
Except there were almost none of that. At least in the build of WoW Blizzard used to make Classic. Sure some builds have issues(leveling a Holy without dungeons or party is still a crazy idea) but the only thing that prevent something like a Prot Pal or Feral Druid from being a an excellent tank in raid(and ferals being better as OT than Prot Warriors) is lack of proper gear. Not the skills and talents.
---
It doesn’t show the part where he “ninja’d” it?
---
Same guy who said he would kill himself if Blizzard releases classic
---
yet the salty retard hopped on the hype train, who would have thought
---
Hey you might learn something :)
---
I have no issue with jokerd using it, and it wouldn't have affected anything. But I'm using it myself while leveling, it's not just him exploiting it. Everyone who is actually outside a fucking dungeon is exploiting it.
---
My bad
---
Probably just turned up with the working code from 20 years ago on a USB and saved everyone a shit ton of time
---
bless those people with 20 stam buff
---
Ayyy Tesla gang rise up
---
so after some time it will be good ?
---
Not like lore consistency matters to Blizz much anymore. BfA is a whole lot of Nathanos barking orders at you and belittling you with snark if you play Horde, and it's kind of amusing considering our player character should be leagues ahead of some Sylvanas fanboy like him in terms of power.
---
Yeah I figured this out on Friday / Saturday, literally emptied the ah xD
---
He and every other streamer should have thought about that before they willingly chose under no duress whatsoever to make their entire money making career about streaming to 13 year olds on the internet. I have absolutely no sympathy for these people and how "sad" their lives are because poor old Mr. Internet Man got too famous for his own good.
---
Weapon skill homie. Keep swinging.

I hope you aren’t going all the way around for the ghost walk and are going through sunrock lol

haven't had a single queue either, so far

I’m a new player so here are my impressions. I’m level 20 now. It seemed to me that levels 10-15 the game opens up with more freedom. 
---
You really just quest, grind, sell/shop, quest, grind, buy abilities/skills/work on professions, and repeat. 
---
That seems to be the gameplay loop. It’s really just about exploring and leveling. Group content seems to start around 10-20. Just message on game chat and you’ll be able to form groups for basic quests as well as dungeons. Imo, it seems like level 18 is a good place to start in terms of pursuing the first few dungeons. 
---
Hope you enjoy it and stick around. I admit there are times I worry I’ll get burned out. So I just take a break. I don’t let the game become work.
---

Check out Kargoz on YT. Personally can't stand him, but the guides are pretty good. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDKX6P4R7g44DEoAQEOOmCBH3X36ZSIE2
---
This seems like a reasonable solution. I'm surprised at the number of Classic WoW purists there are out there. I don't see any problem with letting the development team learn from the mistakes/successes of the past to make it even better than it's ever been. But, let's leave it to the community to make that decision, I think. Time will tell if there's sufficient demand for these kinds of changes, or whether it's better to stick to the original patch schedule.
---
Build up proficiency. Best to fight low-levels to up it fast
---
And so much gold and etc...omega-yikes.
---
I was here
---
Toxic streamer :/
---
Yep. Sometimes when I want to take a quick break from questing I’ll work on cooking or fishing for 15 minutes just to break things up a bit. It’s a nice break
---
As a even more side note this has been a thing since 50s'
---
You can't. Fishing is like other professions in that doing the same thing can only get you so far. 
---
Crafting skills have their items' names in orange, yellow, green, and gray. Crafting orange items will always result in a skill-up, yellows are 50/50 basically, greens even less, while grays can never increase your skill. 
---
As you level your skills, previously orange items will turn gray and you'll be forced to switch to making a higher level item.
---
Same with fishing. You can only fish in one area for so long until it stops giving you skill-ups. I leveled it to 75 in Darnassus, and to 150 in Auberdine. I was fishing while still in the inn.
---
You need to level up the weapon skill. Good is relative. Weapon skill determines your chance to hit and the amount of damage you do with weapons of that type.
---
Never heard of this particular streamer , but I have no idea how anyone could watch his content for any length of time based off his voice alone . Also , that’s a D move . If it’s a “trash shield “ , let someone else have it if they wanted it .

36 Undead Rogue, 3 days 8 hrs. Lockpicking,LW, Skinning, FA nearly all maxed out (for lockpicking as far as i can go).

Currently back to work as of today though so i will be a lot slower going forward :(

Debating if i should level fishing and cooking tonight as I've got the recipe for Thistle Tea in my bank ready and waiting :D

Have happy ending how much to love me long time?

I have to rewrite some sections from actual whitepapers and researches instead of wikipedia summaries. I spent the whole weekend leveling

They simply started on patch 1.12. They are still progressing. My guess is this bug will be fixed when the next phase is rolled out.
---
Good luck brother!
---
I got mine from the first figurine and was one hit away from death when taming finished. Special thanks to some alliance druid that was questing nearby and didn't attack me.

The word feeling so dangerous and rewarding is what I missed the most from vanilla wow.

Yes but many people willl go for rank  12+ which is much easier. Also if you work with other to match honor many people each reset can get rank 14
---
It is, but this strategy has been phenomenally successful for OSRS so far, with many calling it one of the best MMORPGs on the market currently.
---
In your opinion, yes.
---
Same here! Congrats!
---
I was there...
---
None of the other has any changes that mean anything.
---
As the water tiled neatly across the Loch, Puddiwuddi the Wizard gently sat downin the soft, green grass. From an outlandish-looking canteen he poured himself a hot beverage, the likes of which he would never learn to conjure with his magics.
---
Let me guess, you’re a warrior
---
Well actually prot palas dont even have taunt, do what are we talking about here?
---
Abbreviations should be as specific as possible so that people can find what they're looking for as easily as possible in the chat spam.
---
VC is the only acceptable abbreviation for Deadmines because there is no confusion at all about what instance you are talking about. Nobody looking for Dire Maul North is going to think to themselves "I wonder if they're just being unspecific or if they want to run the whole thing" if you use VC. Dire Maul is DM north/east/west/full or any combo of those.
---
DM **alone** is just a lazy abbreviation. People shouldn't have to shift click your name to figure out what you're talking about when putting a single iota of effort towards communicating more effectively would avoid the problem entirely.
---
They can tank up to UBRS, they just can't tank raids because a lack of a taunt and lack of defense cap is a big oof
---
Here is the list of mods I use:  https://imgur.com/CJ4ZTup
---
Exactly, try pressing the K key and look at your 2-handed weapon skills. If you are far from the max (which increases 5 every level) then you have less chance to hit and less damage.
---
The game is shit compared to pservers. I don't care about 15 dollars.
---
Blacksmiths good end more towards end game but like the guy said earlier usually a good guild has a guild blacksmith...I’d suggest going mining/skinning. Or mining/eng as you level... one is strictly money the other is money and utility items..eng can craft google and helmets that do pretty sweet things like stuns and what not...also grenades and much more
---
24 Human Warrior - 2 days 4 hours
---
It's been a slog, but an absolute blast. Also spent time helping lower levels. It ain't much, but it's honest work.
---
Lol gold
---
Interesting concept but I don't think I could see them splitting the player base more than they have already. Still, if it just means the same number of subscriptions anyway, then I guess it's possible!
---
I have tested it in Classic, and you cannot cast PW:S on non-party/raid members.
---
Its Guild Wars 2 UI:  https://imgur.com/CJ4ZTup
---
I've got auctioneer and it has that feature on classic for me
---
Looks like a Dell Latitude 7390 - I use the same one for work and it looks the same (key lighting, size etc.)
---
What is difficulty if not learning things and taking your time? Pretty much any skill is mastered through practice, knowledge and time. Why does building a house suddenly require skill but building muscle does not? What is difficulty to you, can you even define it?
---
I think the bottom left is the right end of the action bars with the gryphons snipped off, which Leatrix Plus can do.
---
can solo this section at 22.... pathetic rogue.
---
VC on Destromath Vanilla.
---
This reminds me of an encounter i had with a mage that i invited while questing. He was so excited to have a healer in his group that he pulled 12 raptors and tried facetanking them while spamming arcane explosion... this ofcourse ended badly even with a healer, and as i was trying to explain to him that cloth armor would make what he was trying to do impossible he just said "bad palla" and left.
---
Very impressive man. This is a great accomplishment especially this early on. Good shit
---
That's really fucking awesome.
---
Really enjoying classic so far. I had a week off last week so grinded my way up to level 51. Dreading the queues after work today tho.
---
Shadowed unitframes
---
Yesterday I had a good hour to properly play Classic. I logged into my hunter, noticed my pet was hangry, went to drop the good ol' bobber in a lake so little Doug could get some food.
---
Enter the darnedest little thing sneaking at me, shivving me in the buttocks and running off. 
---
You can bet your sweet cheeks I chased that little mongrel down and beat his gnomish booty hard.
---
a few minutes later I was back to fishing and enjoying the quiet, as he returned, this time without the sneakiness. He started jumping around me like some annoying vermin, making hand gestures and doing /point and stuff. Running around in circles and gesturing on the ground.
---
So I thought "ok, lets try this" and made him a campfire. The dude started dancing and then went to cook something. I joined him and we sat down eating a bit.
---
Then he did /cheer and sprinted off into the distance, never to be seen again.
---
Did I waste my single hour of playtime doing absolutely ridiculous things? Yes.
---
Did I enjoy it? Yes.
---
(Also, shout-out to that little gnome dude, I had a blast despite you trying to ambush me at first!)
---
Were you not liking the Mage?
---
well yeah, you are using a "not for leveling profession" together with a "not for leveling class" ;)
---
Atiesh who? Sorry, I just sneezed, anyone got Atiesh who?
---
Playing a Warlock, is there a decent way to manage shards? I.e deleting them easily, I've looked about and macros seem to be the way to go but I cant seem to get them to work
---
Ok so i was a rogue back in Vanilla and i cleared everything... Combat daggers is the way to go as it is almost every time the top dps spec for PVE. 
---
PVP Ambush BS is a nice combo but the built has a lot of gouge BS and it needs more care. Hemo cold blood might be a better option. It depends on what you do. Solo-WG-AB-defend the flag etc. 
---
You dont need anything to track your stuns. With time you will know when you have the time energy to wait for another hit or peel away to re., bandage etc
---
Five second rule
---
To me world PvP is helping the other faction understand why they must hate you by killing them in STV.
---
It's how I learned I fucking hate disgusting gnome rogues back in vanilla
---
This. Costs 400 mana per fort and I have about 1200 mana. Buffing a dungeon group is a struggle.
---
Was each fish, though it ended after a few sales so most likely will normalize as time goes. Not a lot of people bothering levelling fishing I guess.
---
I'm on gehennas so the clears of MC and Onyxia kind of created a crazy few days on the AH. Had stranglekelp selling for 30s each one night :P
---
Oh that's awesome, count me in :D
---
and most recently they locked a bunch of telents behind the PvP warmode system. Some classes feel half complete with warmode off because certain talents are almost integral to play styles.
---
I've never played Shaman past level 12 lol. Alliance boi through and through.
---
By removing layers... Hopefully soon.
---
Why does anyone care about sports doping? Just play the damn sport.
---
The numbers don't mean shit. What matters is that on pservers people are questing in the world and having fun. On classic people are sitting in a dungeon from level 12 to 60.
---
Sorry for your loss friend. If you're in the EU, and need someone to play with. Hit me up.
---
EU - Ten Storms - Kommanche
---
But only mage water tastes like mana, I don't know if I could live without that taste.
---
How does one layerhop?
---
Never seen 20, but 10 man's were common, also 10 manned UBRS when there weren't more than a 100 50+ chars on your faction in vanilla.
---
Most US servers said VC. I’ve never played on a server that said DM.
---
Hello All, I wish I could use these but I do not have photoshop:(
---
Can anyone point me in the direction of free to use software I can open and edit these in? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
---
How you walk or run so fast.???? 🤨
---
God, this makes me remember how I messed up the fishing process of some high-level orc in the little pond on TB. I've been like 6 or 7 years old. 
---
(Childhood nostalgia tears)
---
Hi, I’m a WoW noob I hardly remember anything, looking for people to level with etc, I haven’t started properly yet, not really bothered by realm, will be on most evenings starting this week.
---
The advantage of this method is far overblown. They didn't get first 60's or anything like that.
---
How does you going to extreme lengths to stay at some arbitrary level effect my gameplay? Why did you need to grind that hard when there is an endless supply of new players being pumped into the system and getting to higher levels? You make it sound like an absolute NEED to stay "competitive". What do you even mean? What awful things will happen if you don't use layering? Seriously sounds like you are just making excuses for abusing these mechanics.
---
Well thankfully rules don’t cater to your schedule.
---
The same time Mograine had 6000 people, Golemagg had 11000, its the small price you pay for an hour/two extra time each night
---
Logged into Mograine last night at 9pm was in before 10pm
---
No - but you have a great scenic view!
---
The sub for Classic and retail/BFA are the same tho...
---
It was also used to grief warriors and prevent rage generation afaik
---
It’s actually a wrecked orcish/goblin-enslaved sea turtle submarine from WarCraft II. Something I found really neat is that in the new Crestfall Island Expedition, you can find a huge high-definition one on the beach.
---
Sounds great.. if you want to play a warrior lol
---
What's up with mages?
---
Looks like pretty much default Kiwi.
---
Aren't you playing on Gandling server? I think I noticed you run around Stormwind and other leveling areas.
---
great stuff
---
They are probably a different type. First might be younger wolf, second might be elder as an example.
---
Bank alt 😜
---
Same can be said for alliance rogues.
---
I'm in STV now and it's just full of higher level rogues ganking for no reason
---
He's also not just disappointing but 100% irrelevant. He became trash long long ago and inn general should not be watched for WOW content, or any content.
---
Absolutely agree. To me it feels very much like a traditional RPG. Something quite similar to single-player RPGs but with a multiplayer aspect. 
---
There's so much I can say to explain why I love getting to 60 and the questing experience overall. It has really fantastic character progression. The zones feel decently alive and have good, varied and non-linear layouts. We have quests that are incredibly simple, ones that are decently difficult, and ones that are pretty well hidden. They can send you near or send you far, sometimes really fucking far. Sometimes those are breadcrumbs to get you to discover a new zone or are part of a length chain. It all culminates together to feel like an epic adventure.
---
If you watch his streams as you state that you do, then you should know that he said he will create a character on an other server and get the full experience.
---
Mr. Bigglesworth
---
did you teach your pet growl?
---
is it on your pet's action bar?
---
does it have a glowing border?
---
do you see it go on cooldown?
---
It's been VC for as long as I can remember on Magtheridon NA. I started late 2005/early 2006.
---
That's not a macro, that's botting
---
No, they didn't remember it wrong in many cases, these are not vanilla launch values we are seeing.
---
Well it’s in a low level area, figured I would take the chance against level 14 peeps.
---
it was in vanilla, #nochanges crowd is  should be all over this change
---
Both... you will end probably needing to do them both in the journey to 60.
---
Got a pair off a croc I had to kill while out fishing in wetlands. Mentioned it in our discord and was about to equip when 5 folk shout, "nooooo, don't!" Haven't thought about  BG twinks in 10 years. :P
---
Good to be back.
---
I think what their saying is each ability in classic has a purpose, you use whatever ability is needed to fulfill that purpose instead of using an ability simply to continue a rotation and not because you *actually* needed to use it for a purpose (outside of the rotation).
---
I honestly love how specific some classes are - as a ret paladin unless I'm trying to burst a boss down its just seal -&gt; judgement -&gt; seal but if I find some undead in darkshire? They're getting facemelted and you can bet I'll be seal-swapping to absolutely max out my dps. It feels so good when you get to apply the situational stuff.
---
No streamer actually said that. Why do you people make up so many god damn lies for no reason? Did people do 10 man dungeons? Yes they did. No streamer said they farmed dungeons like that for exp.
---
This looks nicer than my game does on Max :-\\ have you got some further enhancements?
---
I'm here for the game play, not for the 2006 graphics.
---
TBC without flying mounts, dailies and a shared capital would be absolute perfection.
---
Those boar based quests are famously low drop rate but the zone gets better as you get through the Defias quests, and Deadmines is so worth doing.
---
No, I'm on Westfall U.S.
---
I would say by doing tbc or wotlk again but that's just my opinion.
---
Thank you! I had no idea I could do first aid and cooking too. I’ve been giving away linen like it’s God’s punishment to Tauren
---
Definitely agree, dual spec is the single thing I'd want from retail. No dual spec really shits on hybrid classes forced into support roles.
---
Precisely. I've been doing exactly what I want from moment to moment and I've been having a blast. When I started playing this game 11 years ago, I was duped into thinking what everyone else was doing mattered and I rushed to end game. Not any more. If you want to cheat yourself out of an experience - be my guest. It's not effecting my game. I'll take my time and revel in dying to mobs while leveling and feeling like I got the full Classic experience.
---
I don't think anyone is going to disagree on these points, however, the 2h arms/fury warr tanking is still going to need a moment to cleave tab before your mages and warlocks begin AoEing if you want to be able to spam heal 1 target as opposed to everyone in the group.
---
On Max, the areas are just too beautiful to not experience on the highest possible quality
---
Great minds think alike!
---
School started today. People who took a week off are back to work.
---
He was never good though? He has always been a cutting edge raider but never close to famed slayer levels. 
---
He got glad in pvp but that was carried by multi-rank 1 players and they barely got him over.
---
You are quite literally the German tourist who reserves his spot on the beach with a towel for a whole day.
---
Great job sinking to _that_ level.
---
Many of us that did it had no idea it was an exploit in the first place - we got invited into a raid and ran it, saw it was great exp and continued to do it. Yeah, it sucks that the bug was abused by so many, but to be completely honest i doubt many knew it was a bug and not a feature. This punishment argument is in bad taste.
---
Wtf. Well I’m glad you came to your senses
---
I was killed as a lowly undead mage after like 8 Scarlet Friars phased in right on top of me after clearing the area out to go for the named enemy in the area for a quest. Was a bit annoying.
---
Not gonna lie. A small part of me was thinking he was trolling. But I said to myself "Fuck it. If he's trolling he's trolling. Who gives a fuck. At least I tried."
---
So glad he wasn't tho. :D
---
Make better bandages, they are too low lvl lmao.
---
I actually saw her aswell ingamr hahah cringes hard. German pvp server right?
---
I like to live dangerously.  Or deliciously
---
I agree, everyone is very helpful in ff14, which reminded me of classic. I think having a server identity goes a long way.
---
Yea I played Garona and Dalvengyr and they were both VC for deadmines and DM for diremaul.
---
It's a mix of Shadow Unit Frames, Bartender4, Prat, Titan Panel, and now, Bagnon
---
Yeah thats true I guess, people probably took days off last week.
---
Just amazing the difference between a 3k queue and 10k.
---
I see. Then I think there's your doppelganger paladin on Gandling. :-)
---
Oh my I relate so much
---
My macro is just /s come take healthstone
---
Agreed. Was always VC on Magtheridon.
---
You: “fuck everyone else who wants to play. I want to play. So i’m going to circumvent the game to allow myself to play feasibly forever.”
---
Also you: “Wtf Blizz? why won’t you let me play?”
---
Warlocks are great, you can't go wrong with them. They deal a lot of damage, they're easy to level, and as soon as level 16 you become every group's best friend by putting a soulstone on the healer, you can hand out healthstones that the tank will be happy about, and at level 20 you can start summoning party members which is really useful in Classic when everybody has to run to the dungeon entrance. Being able to just summon somebody from the other end of the world to your position instantly instead of having to wait ages while they run to their closing flight point, fly over to where the zeppelins/ships between continents dock, wait for the zeppelin/ship, ride the zeppelin/ship, run to the next flight point, fly to the flight point closest to the dungeon, and then run to the dungeon, is such an incredible time saver.
---
Only downside though is that you'll almost never get a summon yourself and instead have to make sure you're one of the first people in front of the dungeon.
---
To you maybe. The majority of people playing classic right now are doing so because they are enjoying leveling.
---
Should power word shield be used as a last resort on a warrior so they don't lose out on building rage?
---
Warlock probably is the least "samey" class of all of them.
---
A more likely reason to give up on them is that they might feel overwhelming with all the different things they can do and have to do in order to be considered played optimally.
---
BRD you can at least navigate. I cannot count how often we got lost in ST because the minimap can't handle a largely vertical instance.
---
True
---
The honor system and HK are implemented
---
During Warlords of Draenor, you could use a mission board to basically make a huge amount of money in just a few minutes or work. Think of some mobile game where you send NPCs to do missions for you. That.
---
I know people who made millions during the expansion by just doing that. And it continued through the next expansion, but slightly nerfed. Blizz threw free money at everyone, and now there's massive inflation.
---
Just to give an example how bad it is currently. I played BfA for 2 weeks before I got bored. All I did was make money through herbalism and alchemy, and I made about 1mil. This was done quite casually too. At least I got tokens for classic now.
---
Convert party to raid, then the raid tool slider where the marking are have an unlock button so you can move it l.
---
I would guess a good amount of players use Auctioneer so whatever you put on the AH will be seen by the addon. Say you're selling 13x medium leather for 15s. The addon will make the calculation for me and tell me that it's 86c per unit.
---
 A *yellow* recipe will raise the skill by 1 point roughly 60% of the time. 
---
the closer the skill points go to making it green, the more unlikely it gets to get a point
---
[EU] [Dreadmist] [Horde]

I’m a casual WoW player, returning for the Classic experience. 
---
Played from BC up to WotLC and came back for WoD. Now returning for some of that juicy Classic goodness.
---
I play an Orc Rogue (currently level 11), and I’m looking for a social guild to grind some levels, dungeons and end-game content when the time comes.
---
I’m also a small variety streamer, so my schedule is 3-4 days between Mon-Fri 8pm/9pm-11:30pm, and Sat + Sun 4pm-12am/Late.
---
Really for the lvl 40? Thought it was cheaper. The lvl 60 is 1k right?
---
This isn’t a Public Service Announcment. A PSA would be “Priest/shaman/pals, you can resurrect dead players”. While an unnecessary one, that’s what a PSA is. This is just something that would be neat if it happened.
---
When I started I said I wasn't doing that tailoring shit anymore. I am now the proud owner of many many linen pants.
---
To learn the next bandage up required level 115.
---
Nice, could this be the real reason behind lower queues?
---
when you make a meme without playing the game
---
What does it do though?
---
They used some borderline ways of leveling to get there
---
Oh ok will do!
---
Well, it's not necessarily wasting your time, depending on how you look at it. You can enjoy the scenery, listen to the beautiful music and keep in mind that you suddenly might get a rare catch which was well worth the time invested. It is not always about the destination, but the journey, which we should take our time to enjoy. 
---
... Damn, I think I'm getting old
---
Can confirm, that is exactly my expression as I gently finger the ambush hotkey.
---
There's a taxi service?
---
I second this.
---
Its already enough to have the old models so i don't need the other low settings. All in all its about the feeling and more grass :D for example make me feel better.
---
Because this isn't a single player game.
---
You're not the only one.
---
I just think of them as overpaid advertisers.
---
I am definitely all for max settings, but I find myself playing on my base level MBP more than my desktop so classic it is. Only setting I can’t stand in classic is the water.
---
I'm doing the Darkshire quest line where you learn about how the Scythe of Elune brought the worgen upon the area and its just... Im fucking voluntarily reading an in-game book and genuinely impressed and invested in the writing. Its magical. I missed it so fucking much.
---
I'm waking up at 7am on days off going "oh boy time to play WoW" and I havent felt that since maybe 2008. Fuck.
---
Haha, as if the classic-dedicated players will get hooked into bfa. They might try it, sure, but all that flash has no actual substance behind it. I gave up on bfa after two months.
---
Yea I tried to be a hero a few times last night and got myself killed for it everytime lol
---
Is... is that a GW2 UI ?
---
I love it. What is the name of the mod ?
---
It is, someone confirmed it day 1 or 2.
---
I think he means any of those 3. Because of their cleave. Can do 3 locks for ex.
---
I try to always throw a /wave or /bow for whoever buffs me. It is quite nice and really just goes a long way to be generous enough to throw a buff on me. Not something that happens in other mmorpgs..
---
lvl 19 and 3g lol. tho I have enchanting and disenchanted every green item I could sell on the AH.
---
Also thank you to everybody helping with a spell or a hit here and there.
---
How does a bank alt help me?
---
Be wary of Hillsbrad. Depending on the players then that's the prime location for PvP as it's the first place Horde and Alliance meet each other. (Dwarves and Undead iirc) So other players may go there to get in on the action.
---
But as Redditor523 said, you'll probably need to do both anyway. So think about grouping up when in Hillsbrad.
---
I mean you have a healer pulling. So right there should tell you something is wrong. He is a retail zoomer who wants to rush and get epik loot like his favorite streamer most likely
---
&gt;If you think of it, using an established tool is even better since all of its bugs would be fixed by now, and there would be extensive documentation and support community readily available.
---
Afaik Blizzard uses custom-made tools to make quests and in-game events happen. I don't know if they kept upgrading these tools or not.
---
I enjoy sitting cross legged as well, but I also shift my position constantly. I don't know how people sit still for so long, I want a different position every couple of minutes at least.
---
A good chair for me is a chair that will basically allow me to achieve every conceivable sitting posture, cause I can guarantee you I'll try to use each and every one of them at some point. And hey, it helps against the various problems that I always hear other people have from sitting still.
---
Man, I remember one day getting too sick for school and excited to play WoW all day (ah, the innocence of youth), but then I remembered it's maintenance day and my dreams got crushed.
---
And it got delayed for several hours. I resorted to reading forums to get my fix, lol. Fun times.
---
Aha, nice.
---
I remember UBRS 15 man raids
---
7th grades so long ago. And as far as his YouTube stuff, never watched it. Stream I’ve turned on a few times. But again, some people won’t like your stuff. If you’re constantly playing the asshole elitist, and you have people new to your stuff constantly, it’s gonna turn some people off. You can say you’re joking all you want, but if that’s your only mode, I think you’re just lying to yourself. It’s easy to call it a character you’re playing, so you can dodge opinions. Oh I’m just playing a character. I’m not really an asshole. I don’t know man. But more power too him, he’s making millions. I can’t blame the guy, he’s doing better than I am.
---
And regarding hyperboles, sorry I’m not the sophisticated individual out here using em everyday lmao. I would say I’ve not used the word since, 7th grade. 
---
And again, I respect your input. And I’m sure he’s a good guy!  I would tell him he’s an asshole to his face, but I respect him as a person.

&gt; his seems like a reasonable solution. I'm surprised at the number of Classic WoW purists there are out there
---
I don't think it's even about "purists". People just remember "Druids\Pals\Shamans\Priests are for heal only" and things like this. But only a few remember it being because of gear. Ofc, if you can't have same level gear for your task you can't compete. How you going to calculate a positive effect your abilities add to the whole party? Or debuffs you add to the bosses\mobs? So, yeah, pure numbers were against certain classes. 
---
But, today, with recent events (like clearly Ragnaros in green) it's clear that it's about cooperation rather than certain classes.
---
U ever played retail?
---
Join Gandling EU and join Come Honor Face ALLIANCE. We're the best worst guild in Europe
---
You deserve it
---
Retailer's can't handle the truth
---
Oceanic servers called it VC
---
As an alchemist I only craft healing potions for myself ;)
---
Spirit is one of the best stats for warrior for leveling
---
You think you do, but you don't.  Maybe for some, he was right
---
Why do you care what Asmon does so much? If that's how he wants to play then who cares? Go play and enjoy the game instead of being upset over what a streamer does.
---
I'm doing warlock with enchanting and tailoring too. How do you get the best value out of these professions?
---
Same actually, which makes me completely wrong in my apprehension towards it in classic. 
---
Seems to be much better implemented than in retail which routinely pops me to a different shard mid combat.
---
It’s Cookie’s Cove (CC) on Grobbulus. There was one rogue debating for it for the first 3-4 days and it just became a thing.
---
I think Warcraft's comic book/kitchen sink style of fantasy kinda naturally resulted in constant escalation. BIGGER WARS, BIGGER THREATS, MORE RACES, with **GLOWIER EYES**, etc. As things get crazier and crazier, the old story, the one of decimated survivors trying to find a place in a hostile world, gets lost.
---
There's a self-admitted drive towards epicness (I think it was Metzen who talked about how all history just happens to be 10'000 years ago, rather than 120 or so), and this just isn't conducive for grounded storytelling.
---
I'd like them to balance classes but to go in the opposite way of what they did
---
don't make survival a shooting spec like the other. Make it a powerful melee/shooting hybrid like it was intended to be.
---
Give to the shamans the possibility to be real tanks with enhancement
---
etc...
---
Ofcourse now the normal joes near 30 to do this they fix it. Meanwhile streamers get a pass. ONCE AGAIN. Exploit early, exploit often.
---
Oh i am, when i can actually find the time from work/family and get in without getting stuck in a 5000+ queue on Incendius. 
---
If it wasn’t for IRL friends forming a guild I would just roll up a character on a Normal medium pop server.
---
I'll check out Desolace, cheers.
---
Are the dungeons going to be SM?
---
Why would you hangout in r/wow to begin with?
---
Yeah or just lying for karma
---
DM - the diremall thing is irrelevant. Its obvious from context what you're doing. Even at 60.
---
Well, in phase 2 the honor system and rewards will be in the game.
---
To be a HK, you have to be at most \~10 levels below the killing player, so players 50-59 will provide honor to the slayers, while not presenting much of a threat.
---
Add to this the fact that there will be no battlegrounds added in this phase (AV and WSG are in p3), so other than the back-and-forth fiesta that is the Hillsbrad world pvp, every leveling zone will have 3-4 person death squads of max-level players hunting down lower levels for honor.
---
And of course, if the attacked player is already solo and in combat with mobs, it's that much easier to gank them.
---
Timegating the content is the only reason you can attract such a larger playerbase. If you didn’t 90% wouldn’t play after 3 months as they would fall so far behind the elitist that they wouldn’t enjoy the game in all its aspects (mainly thinking about pvp here). I do agree that endgame content could be harder, but the progression dates shouldn’t be fiddled with imo.
---
I literally got tears in my eyes when I see situations like this. No kidding. Was in two groups yesterday and we were chatting about various things, doing everything what is possible to make sure that everyone got quests finished within dungeons and also helped out to one guy with group quest outside of dungeon. I kinda missed situations like this.
---
Questing is faster than dungeon grinding unless leveling areas are heavily contested. Grinding dungeons for xp was always a thing for people that hated questing even in vanilla but it was slower.
---
It's all about chatting to the guys you're in a group with. I formed a guild of 5 people who met doing a quest in westfall, we are now 60 members strong and growing (on Gandling EU
---
&gt;	can still clear a dungeon in next to the same pace, but obviously a bit slower 
---
???
---
it's also a much faster cast time if I remember correctly, almost instant
---
Attack mobs when you don't have anything else to do.
---
What inspired you to give him money? I’m legit trying to figure out what people seem to like in him.
---
Filthy landlubber!
---
You are telling half truths here. He exited the dungeon on 40 because it was too boring content for the viewers (his words).
---
Can I get the context? I dojt understand what's so bad about night elf, why their population is low?
---
&gt; All out warfare?
---
Few rogues here and there.
---
They should ban every single player who abused this exploit.
---
Either that, or I am buying real money transactions.
---
I'm lvl 25 right now. The number of 60s is ridiculous, has ruined the PVP balance and the economy.
---
This may have just ruined the classic launch.
---
When I do this, I always go to the mage. It's completely impolite to not only ask for water, but also for the mage to bring it over
---
Yeah what to. It's like 1.5 seconds untalented
---
fuck you lmao
---
It's the same dungeon tho.
---
Didn't main Bethesda studio also make this game called Fallout 4? But yeah I actually only remember them making Morrowind 3 for the last 8 years

I didn't stream at all this weekend, but I had to turn it on when full on war finally broke out in Hillsbrad.

Started out with a bunch of skirmishes across the zone, Ally were clearly out to pick fights (which I didn't mind too much), but since there's no honor yet I didn't really care when it petered out quickly. It was really cool to have such a large fight for no reason though. Numbers were a bit lopsided in Ally's favor, we drove them off a few times, but in the end neither side was willing to fully commit I think.
---
They should probably just reset the entire game. Wipe everything so nobody has any advantages.
---
&gt; As soon as you start balancing everything, classes lose their identity... 
---
Op seems to want to make them equal, not similar

I play a warrior and each of my stances are on Ctrl+shift+1 Ctrl+shift+2 and Ctrl+shift+3 respectively, a lotta buttons but its ez

Calm down, it was slower experience than questing.

I don't watch Asmongold not do I care to watch and I only found out about him during his rants against blizzard to bring vanilla back and how the current wow sucks. While I did agree with some of the points he made, I don't agree with his way of doing it and how he tried to raise a crusade against blizzard knowingly or unknowingly. When I watch blizzard promo videos including streamers and known fans, I don't see Asmongold and I can see why, I would want him either. But if what you said is true, then it's weird how he wanted classic so much only to play it the way current expansion plays, spam dungeons to hit max lvl.
---
Thanks. It wasn't obvious to me because you couldn't just learn it from the First Aid vendor. Been too long. And I wouldn't have been able to really make it anyways because I'm not in a zone where silk drops yet.
---
So as a warlock I should do the 5man thing instead of leveling if I want to be fast?
---
pet growl is NOT a taunt in classic. It only adds a certain amount of flat threat to the target. If you're doing some nice crits then yes, your cat will lose agro really fast, esp when nearing the next rank of growl(level 30). I've had the same issue. Turning off claw/bite might be a solution, but since claw and bite add extra damage and thus extra threat that might not be the best thing. If you turn something off, turn off claw as bite is higher dps then claw and both bite and growl have a cooldown, meaning your pet will get focus back.
---
Maybe you're talking about max level pvp as if anyone is there yet but in my experience hunters are death, you can't escape them, you can't catch up to them, if you're melee only just give up
---

---
yeah i think they are many legion/bfa guys out there... there are playing classic with the same attitude  like in "Legion/BFA". In addition to that i think speed levling is also kinda a problem...its okey if you reach already  level 60 before but if not there is no reason to do that. You will just lose the fun of the game...
---
I made about 1.5g yesterday buying silk off ah and vendoring it
---
The streamer or the shield?
---
I'm giving up
---
How many millions of times do you think this very argument has happened in wow, lol.
---
Do you have someone targeted?
---
You need to make a guild called high noon or sunrise to specifically only gank their guild
---
ha yeah, now I remember, and you can get it down to 0.5 with talents
---
You're free to reject the tip, but who says no to money, eh? Plus I think it's only fair for a small tip. Normally I see what a stack costs at the vendor and give about 50% of that as a tip. I mean, if I don't get water from a mage, I'll have to buy it, so I'm gonna spend money anyway.

He most certainly was a big raider. He was always a pretty good Warrior with some insights into hardcore raiding. But that's also where his usefulness stopped completely.
---
He sucks at other games (like Dark Souls), and he's ridiculously closed-minded about things in general. Giving him advice is impossible unless he's already agreeing with you or you're some bigshot player.
---
Everytime you get closer to a 10th lvl (29, 39, 49, etc) you do more damage, but your pet growl is still in the last 10th (20, 30, 40, etc). This will always happen, unless your beast mastery which will make it happen less often.

You need a 'Boss Key' app, like this one!  
---
[https://www.mindgems.com/products/Boss-Key/boss-key-screenshots.htm](https://www.mindgems.com/products/Boss-Key/boss-key-screenshots.htm)
---
Will never happen. Retail is about casual play and instant gratification - there's still a market for that. 
---
Classic appeals to a different crowd.
---
Something like docker swarm or kuberetes.
---
Loads of redundant stateless / -full micro-services. 
---
Say you have 8 replicas of "reputation\_service" running on your server and you wish to update them.  
---
You add one updated version to the pool of replicas. You now got 9 in total.  
---
You shuffle some users over to the 9th in order to get verified correct functionality.  
---
After stability is confirmed you start replacing all the others, while at minimum having 8 replicas available.  
---
The users won't be disrupted as they do not need a consistent connection with the micro service handling the reputation values.
---
There are more to this kind of computing than I can even understand, but it might be something related to this.
---
Can confirm Incendius ally here, it's gank or be ganked.
---
Cooking, fishing and first aid are secondary. They do not count toward the cap of 2 real professions.
---
Remember when WoW was released the acronym was MMORPG. It was years later that it was conventionally shortened to MMO.
---
I think that was true about 3 days ago, inflation has already pushed mats much higher. Arbitrage ftw!!
---
&gt; Yeah but the thing is, raid groups consist of 40 people! It's hard enough to fill that many slots with random specs let alone meta ones
---
I really hope it would be the case. But i still worry people will blame wipes on "wrong" builds instead of bad strategy\coordination. I mean Ragnaros was downed by bunch of random builds and green gear.... Yeah, they are like very skilled and can kill him blindfolded, but still...
---
Can dungeon quests be completed with a group of 6+?
---
LOL Imagine thinking it takes skill to nolife to 60 and be first to beat some easy PvE content.
---
Sure they got world first, most of them are still garbage.
---
Spamming dungeons to 60 then spamming frostbolt in an easy raid isn't hard, it just takes a time investment most aren't willing to undergo.
---
It was sarcasm by him. 
---
The Brazilian departments of animation or video games regularly post stuff too early, therefore creating leaks.
---
You can learn first aid, cooking and fishing which do not take your profession slots.
---
So you gave him money and helped him achieve something in real life where it really matters but you take offence of the same thing happening in a videogame instead?
---
He's not wrong corpse camping on a pvp server is not against the tos.
---
+1
---
Shush, filthy shadow-practitioner.
---
ah ok, thanks
---
That is one thing i dont get. We rolled on pvp server for a reason. This should be a war. Yet players look so suprised when i hit them with frostbolt while they are doing something. Reskilling is another topic, but people, represent your faction with pride!
---
You can't afk macro as far as I'm aware. You can't bind movement to a macro. Therefore must be some type of botting.

bach then it was crazy to get in a good guild it was like a job application right ? \^\^ The good old days xD
---
It's always time to smoke.
---
And they did it by abusing a bug with xp in raids
---
ahh, i see, thank you :)
---
I bought two pouches on the AH, then immediately had two drop off of furbolgs right outside the Relics cave. I don’t know if that was purely really good luck or if they have a higher than normal drop rate for bags. It might be worth spending some time killing those guys to try for a pouch or two, plus it’ll give you some experience to get to a higher level and be able to do that quest easier.

I always found the improved frost nova to be helpful, since it keeps the whole pack in place if necessary. For individuals, yes, I agree

What made you say it was going to fail? Why did you think it would?
---
As a druid, it can sometimes be annoying to get out of cat form, buff a couple of people, and then resume catting. I still do it though.
---
lmao so because blizzard doesn't plan ahead it justifies you staying ingame while not playing, so someone who wants to play has to sit in queue instead?
---
There is no "slow" in classic.  If you have been enjoying yourself, then keep doing so regardless of whether others do it at a different pace
---
I'm seeing linen at 20c per each and wool at like 2s per each.
---
Pickpockets in vanilla but somewhat harder as theres  reduced  movement  speed with stealth n humanoid mobs move around a lot so easy to get caught (detection  chance reduced  with each rank of stealth) on top of that they can sometimes  resist pickpocket  n break your stealth. (I got resisted on lvl 10 pickpocket  quest n died as it spawned 4 mobs)
---
Vanish is a lifesaver now but needs reagents  from Shady Dealer Vendors and i only keep one stack at a time so i can have bag space to get more stuff to sell on AH.
---
Still the advantage was minimal. Even with normal leveling they would be maybe one day behind.
---
Who cares? How does that effect you in anyway?

Using "race to world's first" as a marketing bait is perfectly fine. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever. I mean, what could possibly go wrong? Right?  
---
Sorry, I just hate these borderline shady marketing practices. I don't support anyone who does this. Be frank about your intentions or gtfo.  
---
I have no ill intent against Method guild actual players who play the game. But as an organisation they should revisit their PR policies.   
---
Also, Classic WoW is not a sport for majority of people. That's my experience at least. Hope it stays that way.

Question already been answered on previous replies.
---
That been said, I love this post and I envy you a bit because you have close to zero knowledge and ask these kind of not-so-obvious-yet-very-obvious questions. 
---
Please, do enjoy the game as you've been doing: make friends, explore, get lost, die and enjoy your journey to lvl 60. I wish I could do that shit again.
---
It might have been a simple silly question post for you, but it made me smile. Ty redditer!
---
Ah god job comparing retail PVE with classic PVE. I'm obviously talking about PVP, and the class itself. You do know that the reason for shadowbolt spam was/is due to the debuff cap of 16, and not because of the class itself?
---
I'll look into macros, thanks.
---
Damn I'd gank you too if I knew you would get this sour over it
---
I thought onebage was not confirmed to work wit classic yet in the first place?

yeah i did turn claw off and it seems to go a liiittle better
---
Titanpanel is up an running just fine? I couldn't get it to work in the stress test. I love that addon.
---
That's literally me!!!
---
oh nice, thank you1 shall go and download and have a play :)
---
It’s hard to have a nice sit down with someone when you are disembowelling their fresh corpse...
---
The game will be challenging enough. Just because some crazy guys who rush through the content within the first weeks does not mean this is what most of the classic playerbase is looking for.
---
The big thing about classic is enjoying the long journey and get yourself into the realm community, because this time there will be no next xpac or patch that resets all of your progreas. Most people will easily need 12-16 weeks before reaching 60. Start gearing up, not knowing every mechanic in dungeons, collect money for your epic mount abd it's 2020 before most people will really get into raiding. 
---
If you are looking for the rush for the next big raid with impossible bossfights until they are tuned down, people can always log into to modern wow
---
You’re a selfish person. I bet you also try and cut lines at McDonalds too

Are their any PS guilds on Faerlina? I'd like to see them get it before him just to watch his reaction.

You are rigth, it never worked since released for me
---
I ended up reading and popping my shield and hots, and just beelined for the instance (good thing I can navigate wc) just had to solo a few mins in there and I had an unlimited supply of deviates and couldn't be touched.
---
I have played Classic now for /played 1d 12h'ish
---
When I made my character (same day I guess when they implemented layering) I was pretty much alone at the starting zone and started to do the first slaying quest. I saw another character doing the same quest and invited him so I get credits also. In the end we quested together for 8 hours straight, got to know each other, did a little RPG things just for laugh while in a middle of a quest and added each other. That was a great experience.  
---
Then in barrens on this oasis people created parties to get a credit of a quest mob which didn't spawn where people thought it would. We organized scouting strategy and we patrolled the oasis until we found the mob and one guy tagged him and waited for the rest of us to come near before we killed it. 
---
These things NEVER happen in retail. This is what I have been CRAVING for. Orgrimmar is half empty because it doesn't benefit you to idle in the capital and wait for a queue timer to pop. You go out, you get your ass handed to yourself by two mobs and you ask for help and get it while socializing.
---
So did I, but I still tried it and it worked, but now its blocked :/
---
probably depends on the server. I'm on a PVE server with no login queue, and economy is 100% pure trash, so far
---
Well WeakAura can do that for you
---
The biggest difference oddly is the numbers you see running around, so less sense of community. No layering on p servers of course so resources are easier to farm in classic. Haven’t noticed much difference in difficulty, classic slightly easier, but from experience so far greens are rarer in classic particularly from chests.
---
Hey guys. I'm looking for a nice add-on for combo points. I'm struggling a bit finding a good one.

One more question. How are priests in battlegrounds? I want to heal but do they just get targetted to death?
---
play and see for yourself
---
Man I got so lucky; at level 10 I ran all the way from Razor Hill to Mulgore and...there it was! Instant hype. Female Orc Hunter hype.
---
Haha yeah! But I made a chill guild so I could just have a laugh with like minded people really. It's worked out really well
---
Did they?
---
After a few seconds, which can be too long.
---
And so the poll shows the majority wants to stay. What then? We split or everyone is stuck with these shitty queues... and we are back to OP’s post
---
I think such comparisons are hard to make, and I'm not comfortable enough with Docker or Kubernetes to give an accurate comparison.
---
However, Erlang, or perhaps Elixir, are neat languages in their own right. 
---
They're suitable for most general programming, but excel when it comes to fault-tolerant, concurrent programming, which naturally includes a lot of web stuff, as HTTP etc. share many characteristics with phone calls.
---
But really, they 're both fun, comfortable languages imo, and the approach of running work in separate processes and letting them crash is refreshing. 
---
One strength of Erlang/Elixir that I' ve seen mentioned is that you can keep much, or all, of your stack in the same language/environment, i. e. Erlang/Elixir knowledge lets you work on your application, load balancer, mesh layer, queue etc, since it's Erlang all the way down. As compared to  requiring separate competences for managing k8s, redis/kafka/rabbitmq, core app, mesh, etc. 
---
TL;DR: Anything in general, networking in general. Functional programming + actor model = ❤️
---
PS: I recommend all the talks on youtube by Joe Armstrong (creator of erlang), though often not related to Erlang. Very interesting and funny. 
---
PPS: I also recommend checking out cool Phoenix stuff, and the Elixir ecosystem/tooling. Quite mature. Phoenix LiveView is some seriously cool stuff.

Was there actually any change? I'm from EU and yesterday I still ended up with a 6 hour queue.
---
What level and how much gold? You’re rich dude.
---
Waiting for the "Asmongold reacts to..." this on my YT recs
---
Honestly he’s super modest for the money he must be making. Have you seen the state of his room? He says he takes care of his mother. Dude sleeps on the ground... I doubt his entire thing is setup to look like that and he somehow has a mansion below. 
---
People have a hate bonner for him. I don’t mind, i watched him while in queue or slowly grinding away. He does overreact to some things and his persona is not for everyone but he doesn’t seem stupid. But everyone ever posts the bad things about him and seriously go out of their way to post things out of context. I’m surprised he still hasn’t given up on this and still defends himself and points out how ludicrous this whole thing is.
---
They are both horde, so that orc will probably just run over to manrik to talk about his wife or something.
---
I see fucking hunters taming him then tryna steal my add for the quest
---
I could be wrong but I think they said a lot of players used add-ons in vanilla to open all mail and send multiple mails at a time,so they just kept it in classic.
---
I *wanted* to roll on PVE. But all my friends wanted PVP for that sweet world PVP. So I was left with the choice of either playing alone, or playing on PVP.
---
This is the response that makes the most sense and I very much agree with it.
---
That typo now has me imagining them playing a game of fronthand/backhand in order to decide the Warchief now. I think I like that better than what happened at the opening of Legion.
---
They are still really good ae and 5man tanks

Im only lvl 17, and feel presure to climb instead of relaxing, afraid cant get a raiding guild at 60 :/
---
It is all about how the areas are designed. Flying promotes lazy design.
---
r/classicwow is definetely anti-retail. But nowhere have I seen Classic players actually bashing the retail community, it's the game itself, that is critizised.
---
He was in the competition, he was definitely part of the race for world first. You don't have to win, to be a part of it.
---
Took me an hour to get that yesterday. It was so annoying. I literally stood on his body with a couple people in my group to make sure we could get him after our like 20th attempt haha.
---
As a 35 warrior tank, this is so true. It’s so hard to keep aggro right now that basically any shaman or pet can tank just fine. Hell with a decent healer and good dps you don’t even need a tank at low levels. Sometimes I feel useless. 
---
Until someone is close to death and I hit that taunt!
---
But yeah. It’s hard out here for a tank.
---
Source? When did they ban people for something like this?
---
how do you know there aren't other guilds already doing the same? lol just cause one has it on video doesn't mean the others do.
---
I know, it's so boring compared to WoW it's klling me. Managed to not log on so far today, just putting the final touches on my paper. Lord give me strength...
---
i find the pet can off tank for me, many dps just start hitting whatever, 1 each. which gets old quickly
---
It's 100% on the weapons for a rogue, if you feel things getting hard, you probably need weapon upgrades.
---
Im 30 and its a piece of cake soloing because ive got a group of friends who will help my get the good weapons from dungeons + dungeon quests.
---
Oh my... some people have way too many free time.
---
&gt;Tough love
---
FTFY
---
Just curious what was this layers thing everyone is talking about?
---
Eh, if they are treated as undead then undead can eat them, if they implemented ghost/aberration  in classic, that would be fixed.
---
Just look at him, so focused,
---
his confidence I see.
---
There stands my mage, repeatedly,
---
TAB 3, TAB 3, TAB 3.
---
All these UI setups make me gag! I cant for the life of me understand how people can play with a UI that doesn't match the aesthetics of the rest of the game. Most "homemade" UIs look like something out of a modern/sci-fi-game.
---
But then again. Most people dress like shit and live in horribly furnitured homes. Good taste is a rare blessing i guess...
---
For sure, BFF &lt;3
---
Yet the people who abused it got up 60 and aren't going to be punished in any way. It looks like the rest of us got fucked for not no lifting it for 4 days.
---
On an RP realm as well!
---
What Addon is that ?
---
this is fucking amazing
---
You don't? I spend all health/mana possible and then regen in one go. It's most time effective. I doesn't really matter if you have 50% or 20% when they jump you, you usually die anyway.
---
Imagine if they actually figured out how to wirelessly transmit strong electric current on big distances... We would live in constant ion storm, but hey, no need to charge your phone ever. Don't know why I write this here, just thought of it.
---
BGs are probably 6+ months out.
---
I usually tap and eat corpses while my mage friend is drinking every pull :)
---
My imp and voidwalker are a lot more squishy in classic.
---
For sure dude! Just sent you an inv :)
---
What characters you got?
---
I will say one thing about WoW Classic that really made me realise how good of a game it is right now - everyone is willing to play together and have a good time, it ain’t about outranking or out gearing others! WidePeepoHappy
---
&gt; Aspects  
---
I never understood the need of those aspectmacros you've just written.  
---
If you have Hawk active, and just use Cheetah, it will automatically cancel Hawk and activate Cheetah.  
---
So why create macros that doesn't improve anything?
---
It's a frog
---
It's not hard, it's tedious.
---
You're kinda blowing my mind right now.
---
Ahh yeah that's absolutely true! I misunderstood I thought I missed something :) Thanks for clearing that up!
---
Thanks for posting something i was too lazy to do
---
I know, and I love it. Shadowbringers is a wonderful expansion in regards to its story.
---
Awesome. Thanks everyone!
---
!RemindMe 14 days
---
With that spirit you can regenerate hp faster I between mob pulls while leveling! It might save you some food or bandages.
---
I'm just selling everything right now.  
---
Sure, I'd make more money selling when players have gold, but I like the fact I'm level 20 and already have 15 gold.  Getting mount ready and able to buy some stuff for my character.
---
at least you didnt go into a dungeon group to tank with a 1/xx 1h axe as your tanking weapon
---
**&lt; Notorious &gt; | ALLIANCE | STALAGG-PVP EST | is recruiting!**
---
*About us*
---
Notorious is a guild in Stalagg looking for a group of people to progress through end game together as a tight-knit community. The basis for the guild is quality over quantity and would rather have everyone make a meaningful impact rather than be just a number, and for that reason we will be doing limited recruitment.
---
Our leadership has experience in raiding during vanilla and most other expansions, including a couple officers guild leading on vanilla private servers.
---
*What we expect*
---
We don’t expect much from our members, as we feel that everyone plays at their own pace, but we do require people to be active, willing to help other guild members, and kind in guild chat.
---
Raid times are TBD when we have a full raid team at 60. We will be looking for a happy median to best fit our members time schedules and not just our own.
---
If you’d like more information, please feel free to reply to the thread and/or message the GM or an officer.

I know I'm not. And that's the point who cares, if people want to follow asmongold ruin their experience if that's what you feel they are doing then let them, it's their life, might not be stupid to them, might be fun and enough validation for their lives. Either way this post was kinda just pointless.

---
GMS ARE ASLEEP LINK THUNDERFURY
---
This is why I play on a PVE server ;)
---
I never understood anyone who enjoyed watching him, his content is horrible, his personality is god damn annoying and he is surrounded by the most toxic group of friends. I saw his stream once, holy fuck he is actually a fucking loser. He creates toxicity around him and god why do people want to suck him off so bad wtf
---
&gt; assuming 
---
Ho boy, here we go...
---
Ahh nice. I like the gw2 vibe. That's a great game too.
---
Fishing
---
Ah, that's very impressive of Arthas, then.
---
My man, im really sorry for what happend to you, but as others have said. New server, new people, new friends. 
---
Sounds like a hellish experience and rather get rid of assholes now than later. You'll meet new people, make new friends and forget about this down the road. 
---
I started out as a complete noob, completely new to wow and I'm having a blast with all the cool people I meet. I'm not in a lvling hurry and I'm enjoying the world and the people to the max.
---
Head up brother, bullets dodged successfully. 
---
(Come to skullflame if on EU it's great)
---
I have skinning. On my server I have seen leather going for lower than what it vendors for.
---
Thanks man, I finally got it, after only 21 tries. I was starting to lose hope at one point, but I was really happy when that sucker spawned and started clawing at me. As a bonus I got like a level and a half from running around and killing nagas in addition to two [rare rings](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6332/black-pearl-ring) that I expect to auction. All is good in the end :)
---
Thankfully you don't run the game
---
Gross
---
&gt; even if you don't even know basic english.
---
Odd thing to pick on, but whatever floats your boat.
---
Are you trolling
---
Rag won’t be killed in September for the majority of players. Most people will need 40 level 60 players who have some level of gear and consumables before they can clear Molten Core and Onyxia. The players who killed Rag have been doing this content on private servers for the last few years, and are highly organised/skilled.
---
How did that work? Did your guildies suddenly appear or was there a reload?
---
Agreed. This was my reasoning for ditching all my other games (retail included) to come play classic. To push the fucking breaks on this never ending "Speed Run."   
---
I'm really enjoying being lvl 15.
---
So how are you going to decide who abused it?
---
I don't think you need 1050ti for classic tho
---
 why did this guy get down voted? He hit the nail on the head.
---
Which doesn't fall under the role of game designer.
---
Meh, I had like 150 days played at 60 compared to the 10 days getting to 60. 60 is where the game began, I mean, not now, the raids are trivial, but back then.
---
Ahh touché, cheers for explaining my dude!
---
Level 10 warlock, been using daggers but I've now got a wand. It lets me equip both at the same time, should I do this? Or take off the daggers?
---
Hunters - do you know if it’s possible to have a cast bar for aimed shot via adding or otherwise?
---
Disagree one ffxiv personally
---
That games been great imo
---
No *poof*?
---
That's bad!
---
Can't even remember the 1.7 AS...
---
I’ve opted to just neglect my wife, kids, and job.
---
As another warrior who just had to ragequit (lul) from averaging one deathrun per kill on a harpy quest ... this so much. Levelling a warrior is absolute hell. No wonder there were no tanks at endgame lol. (My experience in actual vanilla was as a druid. Turns out we were unkillable back then too.)
---
I'd kinda remind anyone on a pvp server that if they want tanks at endgame they should pay it forward and not gank warriors levelling. We gank ourselves enough, TYVM.
---
Stop crying and just play the game. If they want to power game and miss out on all the in-betweens then that's on them
---
Oh my god. Who would have thought this crybaby is actually a crybaby. Bruh.
---
it's for that exact reason I named my mage Notabakery. Some people even open trade before even asking. I charge those people. But if I see let's say a warrior out in the wild struggling, ill make them 3-4 stacks of food and hit them with a smiley face. Sometimes I'll even throw in some bags if I have extra cloth. I love helping people, but I hate it being expected of me.
---
Bind markers to the numpad or mouse side buttons. Easy, quick target priority.
---
Oh shit! He shoots epics and legendaries! Is he BFA?
---
Oh yeah for sure, so many people don't get the limitations you have in Classic. I still haven't done a dungeon where every dps knew how threat worked. I was more trying to point out that a lot of us probably played very badly in vanilla, and there is a huge margin for improvement on that. Obviously as you said, that doesn't mean pulling 3 packs in WC as a lvl 16 tank, but maybe just reducing the time between pulls a little, or tanking two instead of just 1.
---
I guess. Actually, you better check DPS change yourself with Details and some mobs
---
When you ask something that has been asked and and answered multiple times already so you didn't bother to read and couldn't even be arsed to do a ctrl+f I'm not going to assist your laziness.
---
This comment ought to be higher.
---
10-man dungeon grinding can save you maybe 10 hours to level 60 if I'm being generous. It's not like the game is ruined because maybe like 5 private server guilds cleared MC 10 hours earlier than they otherwise would've done.
---
Welcome to Classic WoW
---
Alliance druid lvl16 water Form quest from darnasus to undercity map around highlevel creatures..
---
A fairly new player that is already level 41? Quite impressive! 
---
On topic: raid-wise, there is plenty of endgame PVE content already shipped and othe raids coming out in the next months: Molten Core, Onyxia's Lair, Zul'Gurub, AQ20, AQ40, Blackwing Lair, Naxxramas.
---
You don’t get very far being selfish in vanilla..
---
I even ress dead people, Stam buff and heal, because that’s what heroes do :)
---
I'm sorry rockbiter is half my damage.
---
You can turn the sheep in a turtle or a pig? Can you give me more information on that? Would love to have a turtle
---
SAme here man. If you're a warrior with 1H and shield u gonna get spammed.
---
Everytime I see someone I do, some of those corpse runs are dreadful.
---
as a note to this, warriors should be careful not to charge off a ledge, you end up running as if you were a pet, around half the dungeon ...
---
Auctioneer does most of that... it's obviously exaggerated tho.  Most items don't have fragrances.
---
He got big playing Diablo and to a lesser extend WoW Legion. He played a little of PoE but was super toxic to other streamers and left PoE too.
---
Theyre pissed because retail is a Ghost Town now
---
It's true. As much as I enjoy watching Asmon he really did fuck up classic. 
---
Essentially he destroyed every aspect of classic that made classic fun.
---
Lol defending a bug come on people , any vanilla player would have told you this was unintended
---
100g
---
It has to be a full layer transfer at the same time or there will be some nice desync issues. Also just by looking at how long it takes for a server change to happen I'm going to say that this is very unlikely to be what is going on.
---
They released plenty of servers on launch day, you just didn’t move.
---
Wrong.
---
I would much rather have Layering not in the game, but I still abuse it since it IS in the game.
---
That sounds absolutely amazing
---
Feels like you get more xp and mobs / dungeons are nerfed.
---
Personally I try to help everyone finish in the group. You'll be more successful the next time
---
There is nothing humble about this lol
---
10 int
---
F
---
They know it as DM because they’re OOTL and diremaul is something they probably never even heard of.
---
Just saw a lock doing this in STV, easiest kill ever.
---
Prob. Still party like theyre in hischool by the looks of it tho
---
Why does he want 2 Dps to the toilet?
---
People have been reporting it since the Beta.
---
Bless you dear friend. 
---
- First time ever lvling a warrior
---
I'm just vendoring it for mount-expenses. At least until I see an increase in value.
---
Oh shit, I better hurry up on my mage.
---
Hello, I’m pretty new to the game and need some guidance. I am an undead priest, and will be the primary healer for my group of friends. We are planning on doing RFC and maybe WC later today, and I’m kinda lost on how I should heal people. Are there any tips or general strategies I should follow? Thanks!
---
THISS
---
Waiting a few 0.5seconds for something to happen KILLS gameplay.
---
Look at you calling the kettle black lol
---
And efficiently heal, while providing good dps and debuffing and off tanking and ccing and allowing the rest of your party to roll on gear uncontested
---
Kinda the joke ,am
---
That's... Well, I guess I should start thinking of a way to make more money.
---
Don’t be such a snowflake. People want to get through the dungeons not wait for you to examine every pull and calculate the linear trajectory of your charge.
---
That looks like if Microsoft released a special edition of Paint omfg
---
This. 
---
Plus who is "we"? Your guild? Your server? All servers? If you don't have a well organized guild already preping raid rosters, it's wasted energy to think about this. And if you do, well the answer should be easy to come by.
---
Don’t backpedal
---
Me too!
---
The head just looks so froggy and I never noticed the fins.
---
I am so upset right now!
---
It feels like less damaged received but I have no numbers to base that on.
---
I’m a level 11 undead mage on a PvP server. Should I head to the barrens or silver pine to continue?
---
Within the game, you're choosing your *race* as Human / Elf / etc, and the traits associated with each are *racials*. So given WoW's own terminology, it's not surprising to see this referred to as racism, even if it might more correctly be specism.
---
The slower axe hits more per swing, that's as it should be. 
---
Both axes have similar damage ranges, Prospectors is faster thus does more DPS, thus you should use Prospectors.
---
Only when comparing two weapons that do the same DPS does it become important to consider weapon speed.
---
I’ve been tanking with a two hander lol
---
I have a PC but only use reddit mobile pretty much.
---
I’m not op smart guy
---
Didn't know that. Thanks!
---
Well there is your problem. You are running alliance!
---
tbh I watch streamers at work right now when I'm thinking about how many hours I have of work left before I go back home to play haha. It keeps that WoW itch at ease.
---
This seems like it would not only break the lore, world building and general player experience but also doom the game to an uninteresting state that could only be interrupted by jumping the shark yet again.
---
Dis guy knows whats up
---
Find another game if it’s too easy for the small band of handjob adventurers

Ever heard of AFK?
---
Not much.  Fishing sucks because it's always random and so mind numbing.  You can't automate it but it takes so much time.  Hell, even stardew valley fishing style would be better.
---
[Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/retribution-paladin-dps-pve-spec-builds-talents)  is your go to for anything about your class. Pallys need to:

1. Seal of righteousness 
---
2. Judgement when up 
---
3. Hit things 
---
Heal yourself when you can. Carefully pick your fights. Good luck and light’s blessing
---
The roll is because theres a few bop and mats you get them regardless but BoE items always get shared.
---
Yes mate you are the bad guy in your story it's as simple as that. You never sell something that's a upgrade for someone who's in your group.
---
i would go to the orc starting zone plenty of dead beast laying around frol people not skinning them
---
Hmm QoL improvements?
---
Backpedal on what?
---
This is the reason why healers hate warlocks...
---
Pudge..
---
That was dramatic!
---
people are retarded. More than likely these are the same people that got carried back in the day but claimed they were top tier raiders etc etc. Half of these people dont even realize the 10 mans were more inclusive to classes that wouldnt get in normal dungeon farm groups (rogues/hunters/druid/shamans).  
---
A 5 man group will severely out perform a 10 man in gold and XP gained / hr.  Most of the 60's actually did exactly this. Look at snutz group. They 5 man grinded with the optimal dungeon farming comp (2 mages/Lock/War/Priest)
---
My group is 3xmages 1 lock and priest; we run through dungeons an average between 50-60k/hr depending on RNG on mob spawns.
---
Honestly it's been way easier difficulty wise in my experience. Mobs seem to hit for a lot less and crit less often than on Elysium servers. The aggro ranges aren't as wide and mobs don't aggro others mobs as often as they did too. I notice I can pull a Mob on the side of a camp without aggroing the others much more often.
---
Bosses in dungeons seem easier as well. They don't hit like trucks like they seemed to on Elysium servers.
---
Most of this is likely dude to Elysium among others having to guess values and siding on the more difficult range to be safe to the hardcore experience. 
---
I've probably died a third as much 1-30 as on Private servers, if not a bit less. So that's my honest take on things so far. I'm loving the experience.
---
Ouch, thats harsh
---
One of the main criticisms I read about retail is the community, or lack there of. People say all the time that it's basically an empty world where no one communicates or interacts.
---
You don't have to be a foaming at the mouth SJW to show just a shred of respect to other players. There are plenty of women who play WoW and to take every suggestion that the person you're seeing is actually a woman and say "nah, only guys play WoW" and call them a guy is rude. What I'm talking about is a totally different plane of existence than someone getting triggered over not being called their pet pronoun when they obviously look like the pronoun you used.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/50005003025013--50510310501
---
This would be the basic gist of it.
---
The important part is to get down to moonglow in the balance tree.
---
The last points can be spent in either tree depending om of you want more damage or healing.
---
It’s interesting to see how good and wholesome this sub is while /wow is a meme shitfest.
---
OK this I get. 
---
Even though the weapon has higher base damage. Just by the fact that the other one is slower. Being so close in stats the slower will deal more damage. 
---
thanks.
---
I think you should just iterate to people that you’re looking to quest a zone and not just that one specific quest.
---
Although acurate and an extensive description, it is not an answer to OP's question. Rather, a more elaborate description of his exact concern!
---
Yeah mine too, guess wich hunter has to guide them through strangle now... 😂
---
You could always just level twogathering profs as you go and switch later to a crafting
---
I'm confused what you mean by this. Partying puts you on their layer.
---
No it won't. Maybe in classic+ but not now.
---
I see your point. But what if you only have less than an hour a day to play like I do? It’s fun and challenging to me. This is any thing but a speed run.
---
I could see that, but I don't agree that really any of the expansions that had Pathfinder were lazily designed. WoD is perhaps the worst, but I loved the Broken Isles, and Kul'Tiras is amazing too. Zandalar is obnoxious to navigate through, imo, but it kinda fits the rough nature theme of the zone.
---
Oh that. I had brain fart and thought it had something to do with time zones.
---
nice, i spent about an hour yesterday just fishing and cooking ... was nice
---
Just look up recipes that need fish at max level, and then check the historical prices of those recipes/fish. 
---
I'm sure it'll be cheaper/more efficient to take the time while you level to keep up with your professions
---
maybe i hope so :D
---
Most of the demons are more or less slaves to the warlock. Imps are weak little things that can't go back themselves so they might as well fight. Voidwalkers are well, voidwalkers enslaved with the elemental bracers that all elementals have, felhunters are basically dogs and succubi are actually incredibly dangerous because not only will they try to bend the summoning warlock to their will but if that fails they become quite viciously overprotective and lash out at men and women they think are trying to woo their warlock.
---
Don't hate the player, hate the devs. Yes, I knew it was a bug and I never exploited it. It's dumb to expect/desire people to be banned for a misstep on Blizzard's part.
---
What are you even talking about?
---
What is the best way to clearly wool cloth? I’m level 17 and am attempting to get some bigger bags. I found that the venture co. People drop wool in the barrens, is there a better place for me to farm? Horde, obviously.
---
What’s to explain its 4:20 bro
---
Your parents don't know that RGB = FPS?
---
Seriously though - i play with my son and I love it.  It came out when he was 3, and still playing at 18 with me now.  We typically share and account and work on the same char, due to our schedules, but it is one of our fondest memories growing up.
---
You look like jake gyllenhall
---
They don't have to do BOTH to be the same behaviour.
---
You didn't say it because you refuse to answer a simple question.
---
Yes, if we found an exploit and someone used that after, I would report them. I'm not here to cheat. I'm here for the ride. Go play retail, scrub.
---
It does though. Right here:
---
&gt;Also keep in mind that stat bonuses like +3 str are NEVER taken into account when calculating weapon DPS. They will affect your damage, but they do not affect weapon stats.
---
Although perhaps not clearly enough
---
This is such an absurd thread. How can someone "fail" at a game. The way he is playing the game is 100% unique to him and his circumstance as an extremely popular streamer. Saying he's failed for taking advantage of what is quite literally a once in a life time chance to play Classic WoW in a way that is heavily oriented around his own community just blows my mind.
---
Furthermore, why should he have to reject items and gold anyway? He literally spends his stream receiving IRL money from viewers, but somehow virtual currency is more scandalous, regardless if he originally said he wouldn't or not it makes sense for him to have changed his mind about this.
---
I guarantee you Asmon would've "failed" Classic if he took any of your advice and constantly kept himself hamstrung to please people like you and other posters in this thread who will always complain about something no matter what.
---
You have to show the Alliance, and everybody on your server how superior you are. It's just Undead Rogue things.
---
I know you didn't, that's my point. You only compare the raids like many others that critisize classic for being too easy. At some point in Retail all challenge was removed from outside of raids while the Raids themselves were made more challenging. It made everything outside of raids stale and unengaging and that's what I think most people are referring to when they say classic is more challenging. Just because a small part of the player base beats content that they have been practising for over a decade quickly does't change that.
---
Me and some other Allies killed him in Duskwood recently, but I'm not sure if he was kited or came on his own.
---
Can't confirm. Link is still up and running.  
---
1 person had issues extracting it, but since there is no password, it's a users fault i guess.  
---
If you need help, contact me. Won't help you with TeamViewer and extracting tho, sorry.
---
What happened with Soda? Did he not stream the last couple days? Or are you talking about beta?
---
You'd remove your chance to miss, but that's about it. Players cannot score crushing blows and crit chance isn't relative...
---
I'm not sure I'd call that demolishing.
---
I can tell you why clasic feels so good.
---
The roleplay fantsy but the reason for that is even deeper.
---
Wow is problem solvibg the game, you make decions and feel satifaction when they pay off.
---
Should I heal or pull the next mob.
---
Can I take 2 at a time.
---
Whats more efficent stack rage and then nuke the next mob.
---
Is this green better this stat over that stat.
---
The reason it's so much better then retail is in retail the problems are less chalanging and less involved thus less satisfying.
---
What do I do? Aoe spam mobs, perform same rotaion , is it an upgrade yeah but i'll upgrade it again inside the same level. Will I die lol no.
---
Classic is fun because its challanging and the decisions matter.
---
No one care what you think about streamers or people exploiting the game.
---
The fights are not hard at all, i am talking about making them an actual challenge like they were for players in 2004,
---
Well just comment here once you cleared the raid and tell me how hard it was
---
one of the good ones
---
They hate us cuz they anus.
---
Its percentage based on height. So max of 100%.
---
Depending on Classics sustained success they will just heavily morph/reset retail or release TBC. They won't concurrently develop two games.
---
OMG my mother shall hear of this!
---
The key is to use a wired mouse instead, then nothing can go wrong! Rip to your keyboard &lt;/3
---
Staff 100%. Used horde version of it until I got corpsemaker
---
He talked shit about Asmon and got butthurt that he talked shit back or smth like that. Apparantly in some peoples minds, big streamers arent allowed to defend themselves against people who has smaller audiences for some reason
---
I'm on a pvp server lol people on my server say there's a queue but I haven't noticed
---
Yesh but that wasn’t my point. My point was you’re not going lw + blacksmitting. Or a crafting profession without the gathering one
---
Sadly my German auto correction messed everything up. Better now
---
Yep. I think I remember once when I was levelling in WOTLK watching as someone phased out because they had completed a quest chain that I hadn't...   
---
It was the first time I saw phasing and pretty much marked the end of me wanting to play. What's the point of an MMO if you can't see the people next to you? Immersion is completely obliterated by seeing people jumping in and out of existence right next to you, and immersion, more than anything, is what made WoW good.
---
Postage is 30c per stack of items. For some items you might as well vendor them rather than use this trick.
---
I only change layers for allies who wants to camp the same farm spot as me
---
I do this on my mage too! rogues also get my int buff...I justify it by thinking that maybe it helps them not look stupid while they fight.
---
Thank you! I too thought it was a frog until my girl friend ruined that.
---
Technically cold war. They aren t in open war. That starts in wotlk when Variam declares war at Undercity
---
Sadly my German auto correction messed everything up I edited the text now.
---
Taunt for warriors is melee range also
---
If they ever wanted to make the greatest Singleplayer game, it would be WoW Classic. From start to Kelthuzad, it is a great journey for the player and the satisfaction is better than any AAA singleplayer title.
---
Chen Stormstout and the Pandaren appeared in Warcraft III.

So it's also a reminder that people who claim Blizzard ruined Warcraft lore in MoP by introducing Kung Fu Panda have no clue what they're talking about.
---
Fair enough. PVP is a completely different thing, and I think classic really shines there.
---
This wasn't a tryhard find, they're open about it clearly doing it on stream.
---
anyone have a macro for classic wow with warlock auto delete shard? I have the 12 slot small soul pouch.
---
From what I read in another post about the dead sea turtle corpses at Ashenvale/Darkshore they tried to tease the addition of Pandaren and were apparently planned as the new allie race for TBC before they got replaced with Draenei.
---
Fixes the sentences now
---
even on 'moderate'?         
---
I know it can be a bit too much but on the lower intensity settings it's quite soothing.
---
All good, glad you're fixed up
---
Low level warlock here, lifetap at lower levels takes far too much time, each lifetap will probably take 1% health for 1% mana every GCD, by the time I gain mana and shadowbolted, I could have wanded 4 times. So either;  
---
A. Lifetap, lifetap, Shadowbolt - 50 damage.
---
B. Wand, wand, wand, wand - 120 damage.
---
So quit? This is vanilla.
---
Seems to be doing pretty well
---
Yeah this thread and the response is wild. Who are all these toxic, bitter people?
---
Goes well with an absolutely unnecessary video
---
On Bartender you can type /bt and go to Stance Bar and choose to hide it. Sometimes you have to flick the option to hide it on and off before it registers.
---
Who cares how other people play classic wow, just enjoy the game in your own way
---
As a hunter I find this offensive:)
---
Was thinking of making a warrior as there are very little available, you damn near sold me on it
---
As fellow warrior i second that! I'm trying to pay my karma debt by saving those less fortunate who got ambushed by mobs :)
---
What Zone was it? I only had rain once so far, and not that extreme.
---
I   H E A R O  A N D U H   O B E Y
---
Alliance do this in STV as well.
---
Imagine crying over a mediocre guy who have nothing to do with you and your experience in vanilla.
---
I think before you decide about zooming to max decide what you want out of the game, if you rush to max yes there will be stuff to do but there isn't too many at 60 therefore it would be harder to find people to do content with. If you do want to level via dungeon I would say make sure you have a good group other wise you are going to be slower due to deaths, inefficient pulls etc.
---
Or more likely they'll take just about anyone with a positive attitude because you need *forty people*...
---
Yeah I didn't say that I was reporting. And I haven't it does not feel right to do so, and yeah that story is viable. Like most are if people actually have one. I was more commenting on name like . MoCowMo killershaman or healershaman think one was MoMoMoMoMo... se where I am going with this?
---
Nope. Loyalty is a number. Red at certain level, yellow at higher, green at higher. Overfeeding does not result it in not needing to eat for longer.
---
The term world first makes me laugh. That boss was killed 15 years ago. we are just replaying it for fun
---
How is this toxic bullshit allowed to be posted. I'm out. This community is cancer all everybody ever does is tear each other down.
---
This is my long time blog on all thing warcraft.  I have started to resurrect it to journal my journey through classic.
---
Just go deep frost with 11 in Arcane and you can kill the rogues
---
Go back to work tomorrow after a week off and today I’m like shit...laundry, food, what jobsite am I at etc. don’t miss this grind lol
---
Nature's Swiftness
---
Lol who are you to tell others how they should play the game? Some people love questing, some people love grinding mobs, while others *want* to raid and choose to get there as fast as they can.
---
*That's* the beauty of classic wow. It's a time before Blizzard tried to force everyone down the same path of grinding whatever new expansion "exp points" (ie azerite) and allowed people to just play in whatever way they wanted to.
---
It's so fucking cool though isn't it?
---
Geeez, I'm not even sure if I'm the one that needs to chill. You almost seem more invested into the argument than I am.
---
I mean I get why it's triggering to rogues when people call them cowards, because deep inside they know they are.
---
Dude, I can play however I want. Sometimes I need a break, I dont have 16 years anymore
---
"Other people are ahead of me :BabyRage:" Let's come back to reality. You weren't ever going to get world/realm/class on leveling or downing a boss. You can continue to play classic WoW as fast as possible but don't make a thread in 3 weeks talking about how this was a waste of time and nothing to do. Just calm down and have fun stop letting how other people dictate how much you have in a game by how they choose to play.
---
Just wondering cos to me it seems like your lowish level like 10-15...my mage is lvl 24 now and has like 10gold
---
Fuck me, I didn’t realize that first aid wasn’t a primary profession..
---
Your welcome fellow wow player. I must say as a priest and a druid I feel that it is my duty to do so. The mentality of people should be if I can help this person have a better experience just buy sacrificing a little bit of my time it will be all worth it for the sensation of being good:)

Came here to say this lol weird semantic there and never understood why
---
The slog is mid 30s to when you get your mount, And mid-late 40s to 50 can be a slog. But 50+ is all down hill, bro.
---
This is what layering does to the game :(
---
Ha ha, that is exactly what I meant- the "low pop" servers are (well, were) changing by the hour. The fact that they have to announce which have a low queue means that some randomly get a high queue...meaning that people have to switch servers to play with limited time, on characters in which they have invested time, or with friends. That is the problem.
---
my go to, as a Hunter is to conc shot the mob and take threat / kill them and then say "Careful traveler, it's dangerous to go alone. LOK TAR!". Im not on an RP server I just think its funny lol.  
---
how ever a lot of times when i'm the one running for my life other players just stand there and watch me die so they can tag the mob lol RIP
---
Levelling with friends makes the classic experience infinitely more palatable. You can take on harder quests for a fun challenge, get dungeon groups faster and pulling multiple mobs becomes a teamwork challenge instead of a survival horror moment (screaming may still occur though).
---
Gotta feed him much more early on, when his new. Purchase a lot of food and grind mobs. It will raise him fast:) 1-2 lvls
---
Moved from shazz to Skullflame, best decision I have made. Had a fantastic week off work and loved every minute:)
---
[EU] [Razorgore] [A] 
---
Sort of a casual player,  would like to find a nice social guild with some people to hang out with, do dungeons and quests, and maybe do some casual raids here and there.
---
I would maybe do some more serious stuff, but my job and other hobbies just don't allow it, so I managed to hit lvl 27 so far and I'm really in love with the game, so just looking for some more people to hang out with.
---
Also there are 4 or maybe 5 friends who would join too.
---
what do you mean like you’re vendoring or selling in AH?
---
I saw a mage running away from some mobs once, so I rooted him. Was quite amusing.
---
The game isnt really about engaging quests. Its about enjoying the combat, enjoing the world, teaming up with other players etc. 
---
If you arent enjoying the gameplay loop around 37, then its possible that its not your thing.
---
have you tried/enjoyed Dungeons?
---
I already fixed it so now it runs well
---
If Deadmines were to be named today it would undoubtedly be named DM. But it wasn't in vanilla. That's the point. Not whether dm is wrong now, it just wasn't called that in vanilla and people like to hold on to things like that from vanilla.
---
This is in Wetlands, specifically Dun Algaz, where it connects to Loch Modan.
---
I was being conservative lol.
---
I thank all you hero’s out there helping a rogue out. I feel bad sometimes because all I can do is thank and /wave. Just know if I had a buff to give, I would be giving it!
---
Alternatively there’s a [quest chain](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=55/morbent-fel)  in Duskwood that provides a pretty decent mail helm for the Alliance.
---
Well yeah but the bank alt doesn't help when you see a school of fish and your bags are already full.
---
Lol, ok pal. Whatever you say.
---
Good call ! what level are you ?
---
Noob
---
Wankers*
---
I have seen an even spread, way more so than I expected to. But Mages and Rogues seem popular and common, though there is no saying how it will look at endgame. A lot of people may switch, or quit before that time.  
---
At least on my server, there is a constant demand for tanks, with the Looking For Group channel filled with people crying for final slot tank. Either players shy away from that role, or there simply are fewer warriors than expected (though, there will likely always be a demand for tanks).
---
You should just buy a stack of food for the pet and measure using that, as memory isn't very reliable. I also thought my pet fell down to content pretty quickly, but after getting a stack of food only for him I noticed that it doesn't eat that much food. Now of course don't forget that dismissing and death ofnthe pet decrease loyalty.
---
What an asshole
---
That's just an error it doesn't mean the add-ons been disabled. Quite a few add-ons do this from time to time even on live. Grab bagnon  and be happy.
---
You will also find that lots of stupid people try to tell other stupid people how to live their life and what they should and shouldn't like.
---
Ah yes. Belt of Arugal.
---
Absolutely! This low fog really made for some atmosphere killing these orcs. Poor low levels travelling through here to get to/from Darkshore xD
---
Ya that seems to be the problem. All of them arent working!
---
I knew what you meant. Total pipe dream.
---
I got artisan skinning at 30 and sitting at 250 skinning at 32.
---
Keep slaying those boars, my brother. Though the struggles are real leveling a warrior, the rewards and satisfaction you will have later on are worth it!
---
Layers are different instances of the same location in the world. So if person A and person B are at the same location, in a different layer, they won't see each other. Same goes with mobs and mines or herbs in that area.
---
So if you invite someone to a group, they will come to your layer (eventually) so you can play together.
---
What's happening here, is that a guild has several accounts set up in different layers on the server. If anyone wants to "change layer" they can whisper one of these accounts.
---
These accounts are probably running some form of auto-invite addon. They'll wait untill the correct thing is whispered to them, and invite that person.
---
So the guild can use this as an advantage by making certain mobs / nodes respawn because they were never dead in the different layer.
---
Kill a devilsaur -&gt; change layer -&gt; devilsaur is alive in that layer -&gt; Kill him again -&gt; change layer.
---
Yeah mate I picked up skinning and mining. Going strong on the secondary profs too. Its a good break from combat to work on your characters skills
---
Well in essence you only pay 15 silver because you can vendor it for 30.
---
Or you can have forty people with pre raid gear? I ran plenty of pugs on feenix and didn't struggle to find people in pre raid. I'm assuming after a while it'll be the same here.
---
Ratchet and Taurajo used to have FPs. Back when I played at least.
---
As a shaman I have no passing buffs for you. 
---
If you're in my dungeon though, you get Elixir of Defense, 3-5 good Health potions, a Trolls Blood Potion, and a small pile of stamina food, as well as all the totem buffs you can eat for the duration.
---
I like my tanks to barely even need healing in the first place (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
Does anybody knwo if there is some sort of Bejeweled addon?
---
Been leveling alliance side and having similar issues in Loch Modan. Little ranged bastards are tough for a mage. Can poly one and nova the other in melee range, but you’ll be oom before you can kill all 3. Being able to group with others helps so much in these situations
---
I think it depends on the game; can’t say I ever saw one in my time playing any FPS’s
---
It's a discussion, you're already coming in hot with the attacks getting at me. Chill tf out.
---
Mine boxes, smelt, make stuff
---
BALD MAN BAD
---
Yeah but if you were doing a full clear youd specify, so it still wouldnt be just DM.
---
Problem is there is still territories that are highly contested in azeroth. Ashenvale is disputed by night elves and horde, for not the same goal, for one it's holy ground, for the other, it's materials. The whole northern island of Eastern Kingdom is also supposed to be land of humans, from stromgard, alterac, southshore, lordearon, gilneas. So there is always aggressivity between the two faction, even outside of major events.
---
And even then, only warchiefs just joins efforts, the population do not cooperate much.
---
I am having a great time playing. But I agree about the community. It seems like retail has leaked too far into classic. I have tried chatting with people and make friends but once they are higher lvl the seem to stop responding. I am playing casually. I haven’t found an actually guild where the people actually talk and help each other. Maybe that will change once I am max level but for now I guess it is going to be mainly a single player game. I played in vanilla. But I don’t remember that much of the actual game. It seems like too much experience from players has lead to them knowing how best to play the game and not help people out. But I am still having 20x more fun then I have had playing retail.
---
People didn't realize the value compared to the rarity back then. It is now easily possible for mage (for example) to farm 100-200g per hour in Dire Maul with a substantial portion coming from grey vendor items. Epic mount and gold in general are far more accessible with private server knowledge.
---
How is this post not against the TOS of this sub?
---
Welcome to the real world my friend.
---
1. Yes, many people prefer to max level then do professions, and are sometime too lazy to go back in low level area to do it, so keeping a few of this crafting items can be useful later
---
2. No, talents don't change a lot of things in levels 15-30 or even 15-40. For example, a shadow priest can heal without problem any dungeon during the leveling, and a arm warrior will tank well enough as long as he has a shield.
---
Not in vanilla you don't.
---
The horrible trade off with high queue servers now is that unfortunately if you want a good population in 6 months you have to deal with them now.  I play on Whitemane, it sucks but in 6 months it will still have a ton of community, the medium pop servers now likely won’t be able to say the same.
---
Also, unrelated to server pop but weird enough to mention, as our guild was looking for a logo, we found out their is a shockingly high amount of High Inquisitor Whitemane porn floating around.
---
It‘s a big reason why disc spec is unreliable. Just one of the vanilla restrictions.
---
Obviously, but it was mentioned that the raid exp wasn't working correctly.
---
But mah vanilla experiences! Can’t believe this shit post got so much gold etc. confirms my thought that a lot of you are whiny babies
---
Loot your damn beast corpses people! If you don’t want the skin don’t let the animal go to waste damnit!
---
So it is still faster to farm dungeons or not ?
---
Same. They’ve kept me from going broke.
---
Yeah the level caps were added later than phase 1.
---
Level 39, got 65g. I’m a Paladin tho, so I’m in luck
---
There is no doubt pet patching has been changed from original vanilla. It's such a welcome and small change though that you either don't notice it or you don't mind that it was changed.
---
You've just informed me it isn't lol
---
As a massive noob, can somebody tell me what this is?
---
So i have to find first aid trainer then
---
Both of those had FPs in vanilla.
---
Arugal gear.
---
I’d give you more upvotes for that if I could.
---
Need to wait for the feeding buff to disappear to get the full effect. Going into combat will clear it iirc.
---
Glad it ended okay! Never, never back up unless you've cleared that area, and even then be careful of respawns.
---
Id personally rather exclusive. I've played them all, and retail absolutely sucks imo. I'd love for them to go back, learn from their mistakes, and basically relaunch the game the right way.
---
About 50g at 40, but I'm a warlock :)
---
Same locations, quests etc. But keep the mechanics as they are would be great!
---
Never understood why everyone is going so crazy for him in the first place. But he really abused his "streamer privilege" from what I am seeing. Getting money and free stuff just because he is somewhat popular.
---
Not every server has a 6 hour queue lol
---
Goldshire inn is always a popular spot to sell goods/services
---
It’s like being stuck in rock bottom waiting for busses
---
People in rs want scammers banned too so idk what you're talking about. Difference here is that with wow, it actually might happen
---
I loved the one that lasted hours! I'd join a match, it'd be time for me to goto work, so I'd leave. I'd finish work, come home, log on again, and it'd be the same match!! I loved that! 
---
But shorter ones make sense too I guess.
---
I know that I am playing on pvp realm and if this is only one kill Im OK with this .. I only do not like resskills :-) 
---
Most fun thing was that some 10level higher player (I saw only skull on his lvl) attacked me when I was fighting mob and then he danced on my corpse .. like really u dance on low lvl honorless target :-D some of those kids are so funny :-)
---
If I'm healer can i ignore cooking, first aid and fishing all together? Will they give any benefits?
---
"Layer Bots" LOL. They're just separate WoW accounts. Wouldn't you do this if you had the money to pay for separate accounts?
---
And what if they are? Whats the rush? Raid bosses with no mechanics that are a complete joke to kill? Enjoy that. I'm gonna enjoy playing the game. So many people claim that they hate the BFA playstyle yet you still play like it's BFA.
---
Better be quick, offer ain't gonna last forever.
---
The lvl 30 warlock in our guild, highest level so far (i know, sad), was helping us run a 10 man DM. He just learned hellfire and spammed it the entire time. He'd life tap the shit out of himself, die, and do it all over again. I don't think he's a very good warlock...
---
Currently, if your pet ever attacks anything, and comes back to you, it will still be in combat so Feign Death won't work.
---
If for example, the raid is fighting a boss, your pet goes in and does one attack and you call it back, it will still be in combat after you Feign Death right next to you. If you put it far away from you after attacking a boss and try to Feign Death, it will still put you in combat because it's leashed to you.
---
All it does right now is just drop your aggro but still keep you in combat. And this is 100% not how the ability worked in vanilla
---
Having better DPS doesn't automatically make dungeons null of satisfaction, lore, or quests.
---
However the first test is actually a test to see if your worthy of the  real one. Which you have to get as a world drop.
---
ME right now
---
So the end game plays extremely similar to the leveling why will being 60 be better?
---
A looooooot of people were doing SM. A fucking lot   
---
I was off solo questing in random zones and i'd get 2-4 whispers an hour with cold pitches asking if I wanted to join a raid
---
Stop min-maxing. Pick the character you want to play, the one you feel good with.
---
A guild just cleared ragnaros and onyxia 5 days after release. Do you think axe spec or 25% stun resist is something that's even remotely important?
---
You might not be the most optimal, but you'll be optimal enough in this game.
---
40% movement speed with a one sec casttime is good enough for me!
---
“Trash mods” now they definitely will delete it. It’s looks to me that the post hits the correct note and he is furious that people can see through his shit and possibly harm his income.
---
If there's a hate circlejerk harassing someone it's good to counter it
---
"APES got the world first using exploits and it's awful for the game and totally unfair! Compensate me! Level 13 in Westfall btw"
---
LuL
---
May I ask if you ever participated in actual difficult content i.e. mythic raiding or decently high rated arena?
---
The only thing i cant do in this game is sinking so much time into it to get to the content. Give me any class and 10minutes research time and i wont cause a wipe. And thats not even saying im good or anything all it tells you is that vanilla fights are easy af. And thats for any retail player who ever participated in any kind of serious content.
---
If the guild Apes released their speedrun strats dozens of people could get close to their time.
---
Its just like in sports, younger generations are way better at gaming in general and the next generation will be even better.
---
May i ask how old you are, abd what your WoW history is?
---
Longer than it would take to apply for an online class or get some house chores done.
---
Everytime you delete an item, you lose money. You can buy 10-slot bags from the AH for like 40s or something, which might make you money in the long run by not forcing you to delete shit which you could instead vendor.
---
If you already got a bunch of 10-slot bags, then you're likely keeping too much shit in your bags.
---
5 profession levels / char level. For eg at level 10 having 50 skill is OK. Level 60 = 300 points. This is not a rule but a little guide
---
It also costs a reagent. Not too expensive but it adds up.
---
Damage control is real
---
BOooooooooooooooooo
---
The worst part is he constantly bitches about how he's going to switch games in a few weeks while speedleveling in dungeons.
---
I've got a mage at Lvl 12 that i'm levelling with a friend and a Priest at level 15. How about you?
---
Someone did this to me... Except it was arcane intellect :(
---
How can this orc move with just one leg?
---
They were added very early in the vanilla.
---
He lost me when he started to insult the mods, if you want to make a cause for your self, the last thing you want to do is start throwing insults.
---
I thought I can go mining leatherworking and then swap leather for engi, so I have enough recources to craft engi things and make some money
---
&gt; A. Lifetap, lifetap, Shadowbolt - ~~50 damage~~ Resist
---
You couldn't be more wrong. Corpse camping was perfectly legal in vanilla and it's easily avoidable for the person being camped. They can literally just rez at a spirit healer, take the 10 min debuff, and they'll be perfectly safe and away from the person killing them. Blizzard will never ban you for this.
---
Right now at 16:00 server time there's ~100min queue on Golemagg. Not too bad.
---
Are you me???
---
TALENT TREES!!!!!
---
If you're in one of your faction zones, alliance can't attack you unless you PvP flagged. Griefers usually try to get hit by one of your aoe attacks to flag you, so they can ghank you.
---
Does an active PW:S at the pull generate threat? From my tests I only saw that applying it in combat will generate threat.
---
There are gloves that give  weapon skill so don’t get too upset about not playing Orc. Play skill &gt; racials so just keep playing what you find pleasing. If undead look cooler and more interesting to you, you will play longer and have more fun!
---
I would just keep herbing on but get an addon for mining nodes, herbs can be hard to spot but ore nodes are pretty obvious.
---
I honestly dont give a shit about what people think of asmongold as a streamer, i only watch him because he knows what he's doing, and he knows what he's talking about usually, just watching transmog competitions and seeing him name every single armor piece is pretty cool for me, tho at the same time, its quite literally semi impossible for a streamer as big as him to not be followed around by 9272 players 24/7 and are you telling me that if u had that many people following you, you would go out of your way to find random people that are probably gonna run away cus of the horde following instead of picking from the horde? 
---
A streamer is bound to play the game differently than a normal person does, if you think "wow he got gold from people to buy a mount" is annoying then dont watch him, if he decides to use an efficient leveling way that has very little trouble then its his choice.
---
These threads are honestly just annoying, and also, your literally giving him content, so great way of indirectly supporting the guy.
---
If you do want to go tank-only dungeon, it can be hard to find a group when switching to a higher-tier/new dungeon (tank usually requires more level than avarage), unless you got a 'guild/friends-group' that wants to spam multiple dungeons in a row (so find a group thats willing to do multiple dungeons in a row to make it worth!)!
---
The sweetspot for this will be around Scarlet Monastry, where you can level 10-15 levels by staying at 1 place with multiple SM-dungeons.
---
And magtheridon alliance
---
Also can I buy the robes from the auction house ?
---
It would good for like a weekend event when zg is released.
---
That's not a bad idea. :)
---
The queue?
---
Looted it not even 5 minutes after I fished out my first deviate fish. Got jumped by a turtle while I was fishing and that punk bastard dropped it. I couldn’t believe it. Back in my vanilla days that shit was so fucking expensive so I never had the recipe or the luck to loot it.
---
I rarely see the appeal of streamers because they’re all hyped emotive and reactive and it’s just too much.
---
Like others have said, keep both. You won’t use your dagger to attack but eventually you’ll have one that has some stats that will benefit you. Right now your wand will be amazing. Send in your void when you get it, dots then wand em down.
---
/cast power word: shield
---
/cast renew
---
This is someone else’s idea but it’s hilarious how similar his face is to the cat.
---
&gt;yeah I dont like his name popping up either. I'll say that much.
---
Why would you even make this post. It's not even a discussion. You know damn well you just want to make a shit-storm thread.
---
You know saying things like "he helped get classic in front of us today." get's some people up on their fence.
---
It was on the rp server!
---
Please only use growl manually on mobs that attack other dps or healers. You will rage starve the tank if you have growl on automatic and make his life difficult.
---
*Sometimes used interchangeably with Deadmines*
---
Reading is fundamental.
---
I did exactly the same all those years ago. It’s so much easier than having to run through the newbie zones looking for nodes and herbs, etc to skill up from zero whilst feeling regret 😉
---
Yea, I have a lot of fun playing it like a single player TES game... and as someone who loves the lore of the games, being able to run around the rest of Tamriel (during the Second Era) really made it a lot of fun, but that's as a longtime fan, so it's definitely not going to be everyone's experience, since essentially a third of the game becomes nostalgia avenue for me, which means there's always something for me to go back to with the game.
---
Just let the guy play the damn game. 
---
If you want to watch him: watch him.
---
If you don't want to watch him: don't watch him. 
---
His stream got intensely popular when classic launched and with a lot of viewers comes criticism. At the end of the day it's just a guy playing a game he loves. It isn't up to the community to tell him HOW he should enjoy it. It's sad to see a streamer discouraged and not enjoying the game because of the people in it.
---
The more I say it the funnier the name Wobbleskank is
---
is there level req or does it have to be specific city, couldnt see the option while talking to a mage trainer 
---
playing as undead mage
---
I like the second mage jumping off the dock at the end.
---
I feel like weakauras is so strong that you probably can get those bubbly liquid textures, if you have the patience and creative skill for it
---
yo Arcane shot rank 3 is like 50 mana.
---
Said it yourself, I won all the items fair and square, it’s an upgrade to an alt I’ll keep it lol, down to preference I guess we’ll done for giving up items to people that it’s an upgrade for, they’ll probably hold and sell those items later
---
Hardly being toxic because I was more focused on the quest at hand rather than being intrested in a greedy ass group that kicked me because I wanted to finish the quest first, they’d probably thought I’d lose the quest because I was kicked that’s toxic.
---
[Little more like this?](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/0500322152501131-051510305)
---
I find myself queuing for places where respawn are an issue. That group serves its purpose once that task is complete.
---
I think if you joined a group with the purpose to quest in general youd be more successful.
---
I feel like people are more focused now than previously. Not many people have the same pace and most people have a set goal... get to 60 asap
---
I got a temp ban over there once.  Told them to permanently ban me.  I am home now anyways.
---
Is there a macro to use one action for both melee and ranged attacks ? Or is that unallowed ?
---
Having 2 buttons to do basic attacks on hunter is rather inconvenient, i'm starting to lack space for skills and it'd be more comfortable for rotations without it.
---
If the healer has time to drink, you have time to eat/drink.
---
Yeah seems the community is 50% bitter 30 year old men that have been playing on private servers for years and hate everyone that didn't
---
and 50% 12 years olds from twitch that only know how to communicate in emotes and want to bring their drama culture here
---
On Zendikar Tribe theres a real vanilla community, Its great that most *bad community players* are afraid of the two letters: "RP" so RPPVP servers are freaking perfect.
---
Apparently this "friend" straight ghosted him after getting his computer lol
---
Turns out he was just a snake
---
Yeah it sucks when you get that upgrade but your max mana is still awfully low. I got 2800 now so I can afford to throw some shields, but I'm also about to get the next upgrade on it...
---
What class is the supose ninja? And 2hand tank? I dont think thats a valid reason.. The two of them should throw need and let the dice decide
---
Deadmines being the full name. VC being the short hand. No mention of DM.
---
What addon is that? The one that tells you recent AH purchases
---
Thats... brief.
---
its called cookies cove, so nobody is happy
---
Its fairly decent so far from my experience, worth a shot, not always full either so sometimes (not often) can get in without any q's
---
u sure? the internet is full of people saying things like "  Loyalty levels reduce the amount of food needed "
---
Reroll new character on same server, join new guild under different identity, work your way up the ranks, start a coup and steal everybody back.

Videos are great, but I'm playing Horde. I'm saving the alliance video either way. Thanks.
---
As a Druid, warriors and rogues are the only ones that get thorns.  It’s too expensive to give out to everyone.  But everyone gets motw.
---
As a former XIV Tank/Healer, I feel ya my friend.
---
The thing is, in this one, you can do a flawless job and still be screwed by your group mates. Because everyone has to take responsibility for their role and the requirements.
---
In the end, you'll find that you'll want to find decent players, try to teach others and will simply give up on the bad ones (those who don't want to learn).
---
You **will** wipe, sometimes several times per dungeon. It's part of the learning process.
---
And as you go higher, the difficulty will slowly increase in the sense that mistakes will be punished harder - also meaning that bad apples will remove themselves.
---
\_\_
---
Healing won't be easy either, since mana management is a bitch in Classic. But it's rewarding in the end, so long as you're having fun.
---
Welcome to the druid life! (=
---
&gt; The raids are a joke so thats not it
---
And I assume you've personally cleared everything there is for you to be able to call them a joke, right? Oh right, you never played Classic, my bad. 
---
&gt; maybe a little bit of pvp, but thats also not gonna keep many playing if you look at balancing.
---
For some reason I picture a child crying about the game being unfair and them not getting their way. Yes, Classic isn't balanced around 1v1's, no one claimed it ever was. That doesn't stop many people from enjoying the pvp-content. Furthermore, you've completely ignored the whole "World-PvP" aspect, which is also a big seller for quite some people. 
---
&gt; So what can one do after max lvl in classic? 
---
PvP, raids, professions, socializing, grinding for your lvl 60 mount, etc. Just because you for some reason have already disregarded both the raiding aspect *and* the PvP aspect, doesn't mean everyone agrees with you.
---
unfortunately no, my data is from people using the Census Addon and Posting it in the Forums
---
Yea i know haha. Already spent a year doing the work, so i think 90% of my grade is already decided anyways. But i'm writing this from my work computer, so no playing WoW for me right now. Except here i am reading the classic wow subreddit i guess.
---
But i mean talk about bad timing, Classic WoW released a week before i have to hand in my thesis. Someone is testing me.
---
Agreed, ive done all the questlines because well Elder Scrolls. But not my mmo itch for sure!
---
Your bar for pride is super low
---
Oh, this explains the harsh reaction... But like, that's the friend's shitty behaviour, not the guy doing the donation thing i guess ? Oh well, doesn't matter much. Shit story.
---
Monkey news?
---
I forgot about the LightOE! Maybe save it for the later raids?
---
It doesn't have to when it's the standard.
---
I had a warlock that would not eat/drink in my DM run. I had to drink, heal him and then drink again.
---
Ditto last night for me, 3+ hours and I still need to go back.  Missing 5 deviant drops and 1 mob from the 7/7/7/7 quest.  My head was splitting when we disbanded.  If nothing else I got some amazing drops.
---
Is there a good dungeon guide to vanilla online with zones and level ranges? I'm Horde
---
Swim from west fall to booty bay? I’d never considered that
---
What about controls? you have them mapped to a controller and then have that bluetoothed to your phone?
---
Aren’t subs shared with retail? They probably won’t for this reason, don’t think they want people knowing how retail is doing.
---
Not all warlocks, just bad ones.
---
Drain life .........
---
Ya it definitely feels bad to know other people abused an easier and faster method. 
---
I’m no speed runner and obviously didn’t expect to get any kind of world first, but I put in a lot of work/time solo questing up to 47. Only to see streamers and other people on my server get to a higher level with less effort. 
---
I know we should just play the game and not worry about stuff like this but it’s hard not to. It devalues everyone else’s accomplishments
---
This is so little damage, i don't think it matters. Well, i guess SoC does decent damage, so maybe a +10 % damage on that is better. 
---
I'd also advise to take points in benediction so you can last longer. No point in having two improved auras anyway, you can only have one active at a time.
---
If you have an aspect on, and click it again it disables the aspect.  With these macro's, you can spam it and it wont disable itself by accident.
---
Once again. Since the other one was deleted.. Asmon is right. People are starting to artificially gatekeep content by setting ridiculous required levels for easy dungeons. Another commenter on the other post saying he was seeing "lfm deadmines 24+." 
---
So you can post this crap for easy karma points because this entire subreddit hates streamers, especially asmongold, but he has a point. The community has brought over gearscore and replaced it with levels instead of ilvl. This shit will only get worse as more and more people start doing pre raid dungeon farming and as the classic progresses as a whole.
---
My wife and I have been doing the same thing.
---
I don't care a single bit what this person has to say. If he doesn't enjoy it, fucking quit.
---
They are, but you could see how many individual players there are on the servers
---
What are you talking about?
---
Thats true. Missed that. :)
---
If I can tank it ima hit it (trash mobs) after you pull, If I know I can’t tank it ima wait (boss). So basically pre 55 dungeons.
---
Karma will hit that guy hard if it havent just yet
---
*laughs in BSD tools*
---
If you say so. If the pserver community isn't happy, they can fuck right off back to their private servers. The game would be better off without them.
---
I had totally forgotten about that! Haven't had it happen to me yet, but you're right, I remember it now
---
Well that‘s the thing that‘s exploitable. So how are they gonna fix that, with out ruining the social experience. That‘s what I meant.
---
I have the same problem.
---

---
The supreme comes with sour cream
---
Wow perfect, thank you :)
---
It is. I use it also.
---
Responsible for Martin Fury btw
---
Think it's kind of dishonest to classify this as a retail way of thinking. First Rag and Ony kills came from a private server guild, but no one is bitching about that. Let people play the way they want, why would it bother anyone else?
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Same
---
who gives af
---
Hey at least they had dinner together so it seems to have worked out.
---
I think I can be a tank in classic, since I was too slow in retail. Finally.
---
Wait until you find out about remote accessing your computer with your phone. Fished all day at work lol
---
Sanctity
---
At that point make your own group? This has always been a thing, elitists have always been there.
---
1. Never seen this in nostalrius pickup groups in 2 years. I'm pretty sure it existed beforehand like you said but in hardcore guild groups especially not in lvl 20 pickup SFK
---
2. I never said streamers discovered it, I said people are imitating what they're seeing on stream
---
3. Where did I say I was blaming every streamer? I don't see the point of blaming them I'm stating the obvious that streamers (and/or influencers, call it what you want) *influence* the way people play a community based mmorpg and it has some negative aspects.
---
4. I didn't join grind groups, that would be stupid from my part of complaining after willingfully joining them, wouldn't it? I'm not talking about premade hardcore grind groups that have their all shit figured out and I'm not talking about someone doing a simple mistake either. The problem is the random player that gets in invited in any "standard" 5-man dungeon groups, for some of them (tanks, mages, w/e) the only way of clearing these dungeons is by aoeing even tho the rest of the group wants to pull a single pack and target skull, so they do just that and start body pulling too many, or start aoeing packs the tank didn't pull and make everybody wipe. Upon discussion they just insult everybody saying "classic is easy just aoe lul" and that they know better than me because they clear MM 70+ or whatever then linking the dps. It is ruining the group's experience weither you agree or not. I've had a couple of group disband because of this and now i'm approaching SM level and i'm dreading what I'll find there.
---
hmm really sounds like you are unlucky with the guilds. Maybe try and find your servers discord and look for a duo / trio leveling group. A lot of people are doing that. 
---
I certainly think the game will get even better with time, people are like I said just focused on their personal progression at the moment.
---
Also for being level 37 you are kinda going for it. I've just dinged on my warlock and I've been playing for many hours on end. Maybe give it a few days break and come back to it, you're probably burning yourself out a little.
---
why would that be an unpopular opinion? I would think the majority would like it because across the board, the player base hates the direction of BFA
---
The only reason I put up with the queues on Faerlina is so I can hunt down streamers.
---
kudos on keeping up with all of them!
---
I initially had the same idea but quickly realized it was too expensive to keep up with all of them at once (buying the next skill ups really adds up alongside class trainers), for now I decided to just focus on some gathering to make money as I head toward 40, once I have my mount I'll refocus on professions!
---
No but people in 2004 did not know that, hence they started calling it VC and it propagated.
---
A warrior needs to hit every mob 50 times, they get capped on weapon skill one mob after leveling :D
---
Nah. Rogues do it too
---
[I'd get this] (https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/0500322152501251-051510302). Your own damage isn't really super meaningful anyway. Much rather just have a fully buffed up pet than a few extra points in Mortal Shots.
---
Ret pally leveling speed isnt too bad
---
As a druid I'll whisper you first to see if you're not afk. Damn 30 minute CD has me being picky
---
Yeah thanks for the reminder of how great the community is. It really isn’t, it’s just a bunch of fucking retards running around like it isn’t classic.
---
BRB teaching my kids WoW
---
"But guys we just released TESX!"

"Yeah but the Beyond Skyrim team just added the moon as a new zone!"
---
Well he is a content creator after all, I did not expect him to play normally from the start, and his argument about "hundreds of players ganking him" is right. He brings people into the game and binds them together. He has 4 guilds, that means he brought around 4k people together. You always focus on the negatives of Asmongold and his content, start focusing on positives too.
---
Hunter gear.
---
We did it in vanilla too. Asmongold was just 12 so he didnt notice he was excluded.
---
I fucking wasted money on BFA a couple of weeks before this.
---
If people want to ruin their own experience by killing mobs to 60, that’s on them. Blizzard already patched the 10 man dungeon spam that most of the current 60’s used so that won’t be a problem in the future. 
---
Just find yourself a guild you’re compatible with and progress with them. 
---
To compare it with retail, you wouldn’t expect everyone to be up to the same standards as the guilds who get world first or farm the same raid 10 times a week just to bonus roll for a certain item. They have minimal effect on the overall game.
---
They disclose Mau’s (monthly active users) across all games as part of their quarterly earnings report. It’s about as deep as they go at this point.
---
Any retail lfr group can clear MC in one day.
---
Not being required to have hood gear cuz the numbers are low makes it even worse.
---
The only impressive part about the apes kill was the speedrun aspect of it by getting 40 people up to ~60 in that time. And considering that thats all they did on private servers cuz the game has no other challenges besides funding ones time spent in game its not that impressive.
---
All we retailers suggest is adding a challenge to the game since what was challenging in 2004 no longer is.
---
There really isn't and I know what I'm talking about, you are going to need to show me some links here if u wanna prove a point.
---
Theres like 1 or 2 boe greens at lvl 27-29 that with good rolls match/are +5% on cruel barb. Few to 0 quest rewards for alliance can beat it until 30. Link proof if I'm wrong.
---
Fishing is weird in that you do not need to fish specific difficulty waters to gain skill. You could go all the way to 300 by Goldshire just as quickly as anywhere else.
---
Not intentionally no sorry.
---
It is up to you, all I can say is: it is pretty  crowded now with max 1000 people on que during peak time
---
I had my name all ready to go on Arugal, but ultimately never even logged in. Went straight to Felstriker, have never seen a queue.
---
EU, Horde, Stonespine. Currently a 14 Troll Warrior.
---
Looking for a mainly social guild that aims to group up for levelling and dungeons when they can. One that is newb friendly as I played originally purely as dps but hoping to try my hand as a dungeon tank this time out.
---
his experience shouldnt affect your experience, and if somehow playing on a streamer server bothers you then dont play on a streamer server. moron
---
In vanilla they put some hot fixes without restarting the server.
---
I can't recall what it was exactly, but we were "exploiting" a boss in ahn qiraj iirc and the hot fixed it mid try.
---
I can't remember exactly what boss because it was too long ago, but I can remember doing the strat, everyone got lag for 2 seconds, and after that the strat stopped working.
---
I will gladly go out of my way to level cooking, fishing, etc in lieu of levelling. I would never do that in retail. I really enjoy improving my character because it feels like it matters.
---
Need a subscription to access Classic
---
&gt; The fun part is you recommend a priest get spirit without even really knowing why it’s so good for them. 
---
Of course I know why it's good for them, Spirit Tap is a beast of a talent, especially when you wand the last 5 seconds before a kill.
---
child subreddit ran by children what do we expect
---
Never had any trouble, and for some reason I've seen some groups say "LF DPS prefer Warlock" .. probably for our summoning portal spell
---
I try to do this, and I will continue to even though most players lately just get up and continue on their way, without even a /wave.
---
You know what wastes a lot more time then the tank waiting for the healer to have mana? A wipe.
---
No changes died with loot trading, layering, and no unarmoured mounts. Plus they said this was just a bug.
---
I didn’t even attempt to level up at firemaw. I headed to Flamelash the second I realised the extent of the queues. I just simply don’t have time for that crap. As a casual player I think a smaller server might be better for me anyway.
---
You also can do Alt and Print Screen too. This captures just your current window, in case you have multiple monitors or if the window isn't maximised
---
Only if you stay in Stormwind until Burning Crusade classic is released (if it ever is)
---
Most I think that’s a stretch, it’s been DM everywhere I played
---
You mean lvl 17
---
as a fellow warrior, i couldnt agree more. thank you!
---
dear buffers, this is for you. cheers!
---
I had some crazy WoW addition 10 years ago, which is why every fiber of my being is telling me not to resub.  
---
I am thinking about looking for a sort of *designated* WoW buddy though, somebody to keep me on track and prevent it from getting out of control.
---
Damn, did it? I do not remember that. I started playing shortly before the expansion and to say that I didn’t know what I was doing would be an understatement.
---
Yeah but that’s like 15 talents deep into sub, which when I’m bored of seeing “Miss, Miss, Miss” isn’t gonna be worth me not taking 5% hit from combat instead!
---
But I know what you’re getting at :)
---
I'm back at work now after a week off, will be back home in a few days. I shall send pics.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-professions-overview
---
I was a late TBC/wotlk player when nobody hesitated to get a Druid and Paladin tank for dungeons - are they feasible for tanking in Classic as well? Bear tanking I think I can pull off because it's the class I've played the most but I got a Paladin now and I'm a bit unsure which party role it's supposed to fill except buffs... Especially since I'll level with mainly retribution talents!
---
Personally I love how UD Warrior looks and WotF is great in PVP. The race is perhaps not the best since you should always go for Orc if there's a possibility for that..
---
Thank you, sounds about right. 45 min Q is nothing compare to what me and my pals are used to from last week.. 4-9 hours..
---
I want the fun, active rotations from Legion, but I also want the meaningful and impactful ability-design from classic. I guess if retail could find the light and bring the game back to its roots I'd be happy but I'm not holding my breath.
---
Yikes. Clipping out of context.
---
I wouldn't really call namecalling and insults a discussion per se, but i guess you're at least somewhat right
---
&gt; You do you. In your own pace.
---
"Unless your own pace is quick."

How is it a click bait? That was his opinion.

---
Oh yeah I was definitely on when I seen him throw in cookies cove Haha nice I'm on alliance too. Toons name is Balamir if you ever want to group up for a dungeon, quest, or some wpvp
---
Absolutely nowhere have I bitched about other people enjoying leveling.
---
I'm not, because I'm on PvE.
---
&gt;simpler and easier
---
Aka casual
---
Well the good news is the pretentious cunts will speed through it and be done too early; the rest of us will still be here along for the long haul. The brightest stars burn out fastest; it's a marathon not a sprint. Enjoy yourself!
---
They should just implement a general tax to life tap and directly distribute it to healers. 
---
In all seriousness.. i don't mind it one bit as healer.
---
Shhhh logic bad.
---
Cannot be unseen
---
Nope. I have like 5 friends playing classic, none of us have BFA nor care for it.
---
I’m level 32 and I have 18g. I’m not gonna have a mount until at least level 45. If I’m lucky :/
---
Read the comment again. I wrote that the pace of groups grinding these dungeon is only slightly slower because you can still 5man with spellcleave and make the same pulls even if you lack the damage of 1 or 2 extra mages. The XP/HR is still among the best in the game.
---
This is me right now as a pally. Loaning money to people for their mount. Im running a damn loan sharking business here.
---
I mean I don't like it either but you do realise that people were absolutely doing the exact same thing 15 years ago, right? How many balance druids, retribution paladins and shadow priests do you think were welcome in most groups outside of 40 man where you needed a bit of everything and half the raid could mostly afk? Competing for DPS slots is a zero-sum game, if one class does more damage and has more utility, it gets in the group, and there's always a surplus of people to choose between.
---
For me this is a Dwarf priest with a gnome rogue and a human warrior who thinks he's Asmongold all gangbaging me.
---
In raiding almost very class is one button spam . 
---
However in other PvE in the world or in PvP warlock has a lot of variety with DoT's , fear, drain life/mana, different uses for pets etc.
---
That's Classic as well. There's useful talents in every tree and everyone has to decide what's worth it for him.
---
And I think that's awesome.
---
It's worth dipping into it for imp SnD that's for sure
---
Claims not to care what people post on Reddit but he gets so incredibly butt hurt by any criticism directed him
---
This is the actual Battle for Azeroth
---
you dont "need" mining, buy the ore when its a reasonable price, you can farm gold for ore faster than you can mine ore for engi as a mage, but that isnt true until 60 when your gold gen is highest.
---
How exactly is he a sellout?
---
So we're in agreement that they're known to bot? That's good. That's all I ever said.
---
What? I mean mage can use invisibility during combat
---
I'm still trying to figure out what exactly the problem is here. A guy streams and plays a game guy or girl on Reddit gets mad. Writes post. Failed wow. Wtf does that even mean.
---
14k people are not ok with how much he’s blowing up right now on twitch.
---
Usually if someone says DM it means Deadmines and if it's Dire Maul people usually say DM East or DM West etc
---
My Friday and Sunday was busy, hit lvl 37 on my warrior my goal was between 35 and 40. Doing well with professions too so I'm pleased overall!
---
Macros to save some bar space. 
---
If you have a bar with shift as a keybind, you can move those to a macro. Hitting shift would auto show the other spells.
---
Shaman leader was with his warrior friend "2h tank"(who was actually sword and board.). I was with my warrior friend (brown paint) who also wanted it.  My friend would've been happy to roll of course.
---
If they had said they wanted to reserve the item 45 minutes earlier when we joined we could have not wasted our time. But i feel it is quite unfair after we have invested that much time into the dungeon and how can we trust that later in the dungeon that he wouldn't do it again for another piece. Or worse if he finds himself leading a raid sometime.
---
(Dark blue was another shaman and not involved)
---
Sub now, roll on a server that is not full.  There are only long queues on full servers.  You may only experience a queue during prime time (6pm to 2 am).  People talking about huge long queues are the ones who didn't heed blizzards warning to relocate to lower pop servers.  They knew what they were getting into.
---
You watch the wow streams for the commentary.  If you’re actually watching it for gameplay, it’s a waste of time.  A good streamer makes excellent background noise to listen to while doing other stuff.
---
You receive loot: father of Kragar
---
I wanted to roll an undead warrior because 
---
A: it was one of the few classes I never leveled in Vanilla 
---
B: I thought being this little person being able to keep a dragon at bay would be cool as shit.
---
So I looked at a billion different guides that all said Orc is best, undead is the worst.
---
I didn’t want a damn green tank, so I rolled a female undead warrior and have been having a blast leveling.
---
You do what you want.
---
Its risky though because of how easily interrupted it is to use in combat. Def better than nothing in a pimch though.
---
He was. He got the gold for his mount doing that. I saw the whole thing
---
I'm kinda interested in mythic dungeons (I don't like the idea of doing the same dungeons over and over again, slightly harder every time, but I love diffcult 5man PvE), but I don't want to buy bfa because there isn't enough content that I find interesting, and I hate levelling in retail, so I need that boost.
---
If I get the free bfa, I'll probably check it eventually. Otherwise I would ignore retail completely
---
People are still spamming the crap out of the chat on my server. Either they don't know it has been nerfed, or I'm missing something.
---
Either way, it's annoying as hell.
---
Imagine not having charge on 1
---
I mean like people do it but idk how good it is. Some dude sold me a wand for 36s and it’s vendor price was 30 and my current wand I alched and sold mats for 15 lol. People be enjoying the hustle though so it’s all fun to see come together I suppose
---
I agree with blizzard there are rules to the game and you follow them. If you think your better than everyone else and they dont apply to you then dont get upset when you are banned
---
If you're a warrior, you're wrong, for sure.  Other classes maybe not so much.
---
I’m focusing on my two primaries and first aid. As a warrior, I aint about to stall my leveling anymore than it already is haha
---
No not complaining. But if sometimes sells pretty much instantly I assume its a bot thats doing it. If it's an addon and within game rules I will use it myself lol.
---
You can death run it that room and pick it without aggro.

Wetlands-&gt;Duskwallow-&gt;Barrens
---
More dangerous in Duskwallow but so much quicker.
---
I feel Neuro is a bit too sarcastic to be Bob Ross :)
---
Cooking will still give you buffs that are always helpful. I don't think first aid and fishing are necessary, though.
---
Level caps were only for some professions I thought. Crafting only I think? Gathering and secondary weren't restricted.
---
You could always not play on their server, or watch their stream/videos. You're supposed to play the game and enjoy it for yourself. It's been out for about a week, there will be many changes over the coming year, Blizzard will handle it as they see fit. Also Method lost the world first to them and jokerd.
---
If this doesn't fix it.. set a max frame rate in the settings (if your monitor is gsync/freesync.. set this 1 frame below the refresh rate)
---
Well, it will take forever for most to reach 60. What is your source?
---
&gt;They fucked up the economy so bad that most mounts cost +500K gold (+revered rep lol) so that if you didn't play Legion/WoD you have no hope other than tokens in getting these mounts.
---
Well you can grind up gold in BfA too, but it's a bit slower than it used to be.
---
The thing that really makes me shudder when I think about the economy is the fact that there's a portable auction house mount that costs 5 million gold, and that it's not very rare to see people who actually have it...
---
its an NA thing i guess, eu people REALLY want to say that it never happened tho lol.
---
How I know how much aggro I have or the tank? there is some addon for it? It would help

Hey, I guess he wants to do the Succubus quest? I posted about that today, [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cylivd/my_old_coworker_posted_this_on_linkedin_super_cool/eyt2sf9/).

They key thing with Quel’Danas was the lack of flying mounts and having many people loaded in a small zone. I found the Timeless Isle in MoP to be even better than Quel’Danas in late BC. The thing with these two was that they WEREN’T normal for the expansion they were introduced in, and were some sort of Vanilla remnant.

You get what you pay for. Free guides are just that free. They will probably get 70-80% of the job done but need to deal with the missing pieces or lack of information. If you can fill the voids then it’s fine.

Thunderbluff lifts aren't much better.  While you might not miss three in a row, if you don't stop, or think you'll land on it because it just started going down as you got there, *well, hello Spirit Healer*.

&gt; massive hate thread
---
Pointing out someone's hypocrisy isn't "hate". I just re-read the thread and I see nothing wrong with it. Mods made the right call by leaving it up. 
---
If you can't handle some objective criticism, then you shouldn't be a streamer.
---
So while levelling, I can offer my services as a paladin healer without needing a lot of holy points, perhaps just some spirit/int gear?
---
If you don't care and people shouldn't care why did you post this? I'm not surprised about Asmongold at all, I haven't enjoyed him the past few years and I always thought he was a hypocritical fanboy when it came to vanilla/classic.
---
That's my experience playing as a priest while in party with the warlock.
---
Yknow, despite telling people at the beginning of the dungeon that I really only had the Mana pool to keep the main tank alive
---
Make a second character, corpse-run it to nearest capital city with an AH.   
---
Relog your main, keep playing.    
---
Whenever you go back to your questing hub area, rather than vendoring everything (instant small monetary reward), you send everything that is trade goods or better (greens, blues etc) to your bankalt via the mailbox. Also send a little bit of silver/gold so it can afford the initial posting and mailing fees. 
---
Keep playing your main for at least an hour (time it takes mail to arrive in inbox).     
---
Relog bankalt.       
---
(Optional: Using auctioneer/auctionator/trade skill master addons, do full scans of AH daily for pricing data and market value information gathering.)          
---
           
---
Post everything on AH at competitive prices.    
---
You make more money this way and you avoid having to make such frequent/long trips to the cities when you would rather be out in the world, playing.
---
Just google around, check out wowhead or icyviens. Those will at least get you started then use the google machine to find specific stuff.
---
Search YouTube for shortcut from IF to Menethil
---
I don't know why anyone would care what this arrogant prick says...
---
Cool staff bro
---
You will learn them over time. If you are unsure, just whipser the guy or ask in general chat. People are helpful on average.

You can also install AtlasLoot addon (which is a must anyway imho) and try to discern the acronyms from there.

Chen is a legendary warrior who can single handed deliver an excuse for many blizzard apologists about why making a whole expansion about kung fu panda is a good idea.

with Rep at honored it is only 90 Gold though right?

Imagine being like a warlock with all the same pet skill costs but you also need to shell out for food money AND you don't get a free mount out of it.

So many great memories. I modded mine and had a sexy female voice say "critical damage"... Oh teenage me.

Note to healers, I dont need healing when im spamming life tap

Black dessert online fishing is the best really wish more worked that way

That was great.

Because people enjoy doing that. It makes no sense how that could be toxic lol.

Tram to Ironforge, run menethil harbor in the wetlands, taketh boat on the right to Darkshore.
---
If you don't want to do the long long run, YouTube the short cut from Dun morph to Menethil Harbor.
---
Yeah absolutely. I do believe some people put too much weight into the minmaxing though. I'll give an example.
---
I've read a thread about someone stressing out about being a human mage as opposed to a gnome and wondered if they would be gimped because they wouldn't have the +5% intellect racial. Someone crunched the numbers on it and it ended up coming out that only on BiS Naxx gear does that intellect make any difference. But that difference was that given a Frostbolt spam, a gnome mage would be able to cast a single frostbolt extra before going oom.
---
I had to run that shit 3 times to get the deviate hide quests done...
---
Tough crowd here..
---
amen

Brotha. Thank you.
---
Remember faction discounts, too! It's not too bad all things considered
---
It's damned infuriating.
---
Do you mean a spade or a shovel?
---
shut up
---
The difference is how each person including you feels about them
---
All they're going to do is run out of content faster. Only playing themselves.
---
They are deleting comments that are hostile or start a flame war between retail and classic players after some toxic classic players have started to insult retail players. Now people are making fun of classic and they are also getting deleted.
---
That has nothing to do with shitting on bfa. You are free to shit on bfa when its constructive and not bait
---
I really dont know why people think Asmon is  good at the game , he is a spoiled retard. I mean, I watch him just because ppl are trolling him hard , not because I think he is a good player or streamer, if you really want good content , watch Frost, Madseason, Pilav, Monkey ect.
---
I can assure you that the vast majority of players are not giving a flying fuck about this - they are busy sitting in a queue anyway.
---
All this is, is a noisy minority.
---
Actually no I have not.
---
When I was downloading them the past 2 days fiddling with it I would go to Curse and then game version &gt; classic

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons?filter-game-version=1738749986:67408&amp;filter-sort=4&amp;page=2

Its worked for all my other addons so I didn't think much of it and just thought the addon was broke.
---
Dual spec for a one time fee would make a great compromise to integrate into classic.  Still stuck with what you pick and have to pay to reset, but at least classes with multiple roles don’t get screwed over as badly with constant respec fees at endgame.  I still remember there being such a big deal about it the first time around when it was introduced.
---
Never heard of this guy until I came to WoW for the release of classic. He definitely rubs me the wrong way and I’ve been wondering why so many people follow his shtick online
---
For someone who looks half-dead 24/7 I’m surprised he’s even capable of investing energy outside of the actual video game responding to criticism on Reddit. This isn’t the first clip I’ve seen of him nonchalantly trying to tell others he could care less about his critics
---
People tend to be dislike when they say I won't do X and then do X.

I just started healing. I feel this.
---
No doubt, I guess I could have been more specific. Our tank was made of paper and even pulling 3 mobs was causing our healer to go oom on every pull. She would start drinking and only get  like 1/3 of their mana back before the tank was almost dead. I run every dungeon with this healer and I know she's got the skills to handle it. The last run we did had an amazing tank that was smart with their cooldowns and we were able to drink during pulls
---
Yeah I would say you will be ok, if your tank is decent you should be good.
---
I bind the mouse wheel to next/previous target. I then set camera zoom go alt+mouse wheel.
---
I never thought about that before. and won't do it often.  But there's always that one guy that deserves it.  Thanks for the idea!
---
10 minutes?!
---
Healers adjust
---
Dominant strategy. Big game design term. If you give players a superior form of advancing through their given hurdles they will always use that one method. Since this takes more than just a single person to do and is not intended, less people will do it, but obviously too many to ignore. 
---
It's like violence in real life, it's too good at getting what you want to ignore it and it takes a superior form of violence (from your government) to dissuade it.
---
Had one like that in Shadowfang Keep.
---
I started ignoring him when he would do that shit.
---
This has to be a non PVP server....the ganking in STV alone would be enough to discourage anyone trying to level fishing.
---
Thanks, that’s really helpful!
---
lmao k
---
Pick any server that’s not listed as full and you’ll be totally fine. I’m playing on two high pop servers, longest que I’ve had was 6 minutes and that was one time. Never had any issues with overcrowding in any zone either!
---
Stormscale-US was always VC. I'm in that camp. 
---
I won't roast anyone for not, doesnt matter really, , but I'll die on this hill - just because Diremaul isnt out... doesnt mean we dont know it exists.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
you abandoned your 33 to roll fresh because other people on your server hopped layers and 10 man raided? Lol.
---
There is a difference between people who attack a version of the game, and actually talking about ***specific*** good/bad things about it. Regarding MMO-C, while comments were deleted, I saw many accounts with that glorious 'banned' avatar title because they were just being hostile and argumentative.
---
This was me.  I succumbed.  It’s like crack cocaine.
---
OmenThreat meter or Details can work.
---
Details is excellent, if everyone in the group has it.
---
Omen works better if more has it.
---
Is someone playing on an mac book air? How does it run on this potato?
---
Oddly, I've leveled cooking faster this time around than any other I've played WoW. Same with leather working, but that's because I camped near a yeti cave skinning as fast as I could for levels 1-10.
---
Get a remote PC app and fish while away from home.
---
What?
---
I thought my UI was bugging, was driving me nuts.
---
Yes on the skills tab, you can select the profession and press a little x to forget it.
---
Prob they're using the old method so it doesn't have the new combined pet function that retail wow has. Which was most likely tied to account.
---
Yes they did prune a ton if things which is a shame, but the rotations are definitely more difficult in retail still. Especially when you take into account cooldown windows, retail can be incredibly punishing if you screw up your rotation
---
Great, thanks for the help.
---
Classic is for rpg fans, retail is for ARPG fans.
---
Cause asmon is a Trump supporting loser who cant take criticism
---
I’ll tell you, as a vanilla BC player the procs don’t come off to me as defined, smooth, complex, they come off as HERES WHAT YOU DO ASSHOLE. 
---
Instead of vanilla BC where proc stuff was kinda rare but did happen.  Without all that “smoothness” you have to actually think about cost effectiveness. Every spell you cast, or even start and interrupt casting is meaningful. Like what do I start with? How often do I incorporate this instant? Is it mana effect to use every CD?  Playing a shadow priest in vanilla and BC was cool because you really decided your rotation, and that may or may not have been best. Not “oh blizzard is telling me to use this because it’s free -no brainer-
---
Jeez man, agree with L1Wanderer, must be a fun guyyy
---
The difference is that there are fixed costs for certain things that will never change. e.g. Repair costs, Epic Mount training.
---
This means generally it's better to hoard things that are cheap now, but will be valuable when people are 60.
---
Deviate fish are one of those things.
---
You only want aimed shot from the MM tree. Everything else there is non impactful outside of boss fights.
---
After.
---
Tanking is viable, you can probably do some as ret as well. Warriors / Pallys commonly tankneith 2 handers while leveling. If anything threat is the issue.
---
It has really up'd the danger of going alone into a building or cave when all of a sudden all the mobs respawn.  
---
Skull rock is hard enough. Now add that mob your killing might just respawn right before you finishing killing it
---
What if nobody js using it lol
---
&gt; Nope, everything is on lowest option or disabled if possible.
---
print screen next time my dear technologically illiterate boomer

You're arguing with someone who doesn't understand basic addition and subtraction. Just give up bro.
---
There was a druid thread every other day for weeks leading up to classic launch.
---
But why?
---
It's easy, the shaman gets it.
---
Good rewards for that quest too!
---
Almost makes me want to level a healer...almost.
---
In classic there are several zones that does not have enough quests for you to reach the next zone/zones, what you’ll have to do is either grind mobs on your own or do some dungeons, especially if you can pick up quests for the dungeon.
---
I’m not sure if anyone can decide what would you like to play. Every class has something unique so the best way would be to try atleast a couple of them and see what works for you.
---
I’ve played PvP since 2005 no thanks
---
This needs to be up there more.
---
So not a celeb
---
thanks for the advice I definitely will do that :)
---
I don't think you can generalize all streamers lmao
---
Welcome to classic
---
I dont think you quite understand the prepp we did in apes, we probably had 100 people assigned to grind different things at the same time be it herbalism/fire ress gear/ubrs key/alchemy without sleep.
---
We did the prepp, just very hardcore and organized, our tank had like 250 fire ress on rag.
---
Or, getting through the door right as it closes. Then you're stuck waiting inside anyways.
---
The first pg i ever leveled was a warrior. It wasn't vanilla but tbc, but it was already kinda harsh.
---
Now i have a druid.
---
I got improved mark of the wild
---
I did this on accident on my first character ever back in 05
---
Basically, (gun dps)+(ammo dps)=(actual dps)
---
That was a different game. Also at that time the game released way earlier in US than in Europe if I recall correctly.
---
I got a q also. So there is no Thistle Tea in the AH house. How much should i sell em for?
---
Engineering is cool, it's also just so damn expensive!

Hell yes mate this picture is life

Just wait for the time you get on a boat with the opposite faction. Oh, a priest? MC'd and walked off the boat.

I've seen shamans in dungeons with rockbiter on their weapon, it's a threat generating buff, I guess some people don't read the tooltip fully.
---
The dude above me did and I responded and I pointed out in the comments before that, humans in general are shitty and are always looking to game the system in their favor. Its literally just drawing a parallel in human behavior.
---
Wtf is a layer
---
Let the Apes get their bananas
---
Warriors are the single most gear dependant class going. It's really common for this to be happening until you gear up at 60. Unfortunately there isn't much you can do bar getting useful items from professions and having a high level of first aid
---
Cost drops by 5g every month that you don't respec
---
There is no way you don't wear a fedora.
---
Same as you, managed to get to 40 in a stretch at launch. Havent been able to log on ever since. 
---
The queue is at 11k right now, so I logged off and cancel my subscription. Aint doing this shit, might try again in a few months.
---
Then just skip it and run stocks.
---
My point is that, essentially, to speedrunners, the rules:
---
1) weren't vanilla classic rules
---
2) were changed after someone already won, but they are still the 'winner' and no one else can follow exactly in their footsteps for the same results

As early as possible, clicking the bobber is great for developing hand eye coordination in babies

Only very good or specific gear sells on the AH. For example +frost damage cloth gear usually sells for 3-5x the vendor price but most other things aren't really worth it to put up on the AH because it isn't that likely that you will sell them and it costs like 1/5th of the vendor price to even list them.

People can call it whatever they want. It is VC tho.

You’re asking in the classic wow subreddit. Everyone will say play classic, including me.

Not only are you obsessed, you are straight wrong. He fought for Classic WoW for us. He can't enjoy it the same way we can for obvious reasons, so he has to play it different. Maybe next time put yourself in his shoes before making this embarrassing post.

&gt; stacking potion on retails eailer this month.
---
Yeah that was over 6 months ago
---
I always pair skinning with mining or herbalism on my first character leveling up. Skinning is kinda just free while leveling and you get a good source of income.
---
Find a healer and group up for that sweet exp!
---
Welcome to being a warrior in classic!  Don’t fight things your level, fight things 1-2 levels lower.
---
Hopefully you’re leveling first aid and have a stack of food to increase efficiency.
---
And does it get better? Mortal strike and plate at 40 will help considerably.
---
Yeah the locks are annoying me as a healer.  I barely have enough mana to keep everyone alive under normal circumstances, I really don’t need to worry about the lock spamming shadow bolt who’s doing lower dps than my wand.
---
N O H A I R
---
Thats some phat lewtz you got there.
---
Classic is harder to tag multiple mobs and survive and mobs take longer to kill and downtime is increased between fights. Really though you're still mostly autoattacking in place while hitting a few abilities now and then. Like, they could tune Retail leveling like that again if they wanted, they already slowed down XP gain and beefed up enemies to scale up to your level and made em harder to kill. But "harder" doesn't equal fun necesarily
---
He was more than happy to pay he even said he’d buy from me first lol
---
I got kicked because I was more focused on wanting to finish the quest instead of selling my axe
---
What if I'm in Org. Can I assume it's Dire Maul then? Do people not build groups in cities for instances now? I'm unclear on where I'm allowed to build groups now, I'll have to reference a guide later.
---
On laptop using just laptops keypad and touchpad. No mouse. What class should I go with? I am thinking this handicap will hinder me.
---
I felt this...
---
I generally agree but if you pick up cooking you will sell cooked meat for a whole lot more than the raw drops
---
But he gets Whirlwind Axe...
---
Do you want action, and nonstop combat, focused on endgame only, but a lack of community and over balance to the point of detriminting class identity? Then retail.
---
If you want a slower. More community based experience, where the journey to max level isore important, with more rpg elements and slower combat, then classic.
---
&gt;  a bunch of nobodies
---
I'm not up on who was big on private servers, but from everything I've heard, bunch of nobodies is not an accurate statement for people who were tracking the favourites in this race.
---
What does it mean for someone to want to run "Dire Maul" ?  You might as well advertise for a run for Blackrock Mountain.
---
You see someone looking for a group for DM, shift click them, and see they're level 60 or close to it. Then you use your brain and deduce they are looking for a Dire Maul group, not a Deadmines group, because that is the content appropriate for their level.
---
I don’t mind when you life tap. I mind when you life tap to 20% and then pull the boss because you don’t understand threat mitigation and then I’m healing you at 20% against the boss whacks.
---
Be a grad student and work full time at your university
---
Cause it’s not really WoW classic. It’s the Legion-engine reworked to look and feel like classic.
---
I’ve experienced this exact same thing. compared to actual 1.12 clients the classic wow client is extremely more intensive.
---
Hey I take offen..... Ahh shit you are right, I can't help being a dick its so fun.
---
Yeah I just expect the occasional hot if I’m spamming life tap it’s when I know I’m in no danger and want to maintain some damage or we are about to wipe and I need some damage. I do like spamming it after a fight and asking for heals to wind the healer up though ;p
---
I'm not saying your wrong because this is my first time leaving engineering but could you tell me when it gets expensive? I'm at 225 right now and it hasn't cost me penny, I'm assuming just from higher level stuff?
---
I am leveling mining alongside it and simply used all my own mats however looking st ah prices with the massive influx of low level mats hou could probably buy the mats straight off the ah to get to about  150 level.
---
I just hope I'm not investing in a money sink lol
---
Used my horn, some orc killed mine and ran off. Didn't have the horn so I had to take from some poor undead's. I still feel bad but I wasn't about to run back and start over

thats asmongold every pull.

Until the random person dies and then the mob comes after you.
---
What's the add-on for that bar at the top?
---
Pretty sure got trolled if you’re talking about the target dummies in cities. Those are simply there to test you rotation and I think you can level weapon skills to a point. They drop no loot.
---
Today I've learned a lot of people don't have a very good concept of how long it takes to run several DM instances back to back.
---
classic wow is just nostalgia, you guys will get bored of it soon enough.
---
I sincerely believe, that conversations, that compare Classic and Retail WoW expiriences are super vital right now/ We can explore ideas, that could contribute to betterment of retail WoW.  
---
There is difference between shutting down conversations altogether and controlling threads not to lead into flame wars.
---
Instead of just killing random questers, it was much sweeter to kill someone who did exactly that instead, and give them a taste of the same. So people would always help out and hunt eachother down if that was their game. Think it could be cool if there was some kind of broadcast of "X got killed by enemy player" in wow as well.
---
In general chat, someone always asks what the queue time is
---
Yes! Doing my Shaman water totem quest and there was a level 24 mob (I’m 20) camping the pond. Killed me but another shaman doing the same quest must have seen and rezed me. This was super helpful since I was due for my 7th long barrens corpse run that night already.
---
And that’s the way it was
---
Lol that was awesome. I’m laughing out loud in the gym right now

Pro-tip, don't do Cookie last, you can rarely get a group to jump down right.

&gt; How do i know which items are going  to be worth a lot in AH? I’ve just been selling everything i don’t keep  to the shop but saw a post mentioning an item which is BiS for a  “twink”? Wtf is a twink?
---
It depend on the server, sometime, some items are very popular on one and not on another. Usually, everything crafting-related can be useful. 
---
Also, a twink is a low-level character with the absolute best gear he can afford.They are usually lvl 19/29/39 so they can absolutely stomp everyone in battlegrounds (who matchmake characters from a 10-levels bracket), but i don't know if battlegrounds are already there.
---
&gt;I have a  dire wand and It does “shadow damage”. What’s the difference between  shadow damage and arcane damage? Is one better than the other?
---
All spells have a differente nature of damage (fire spells do fire damages from example). Depending of your class, items and spec, you can have talent/items that boost X or Y type of damage. Also, some items or even races and monsters have a bonus resistance against some type of damage. Using fire spells against a fire elemental isn't a good idea.
---
&gt;How can i tell how much “threat” there is with an ability and how do i minimise getting targeted by mobs?
---
There are addon for that, i think. The best way to minimize threat is doing consistent damages (not in burst) and wait for your tank to "build" threats before attacking a monster.
---
5x vendor price
---
Aye, you are right!
---
The opposite isn't true in vanilla however, high level areas require high level fishing if you actually want to catch anything.

It is clickbait, easy money for him. And you posted it, giving him a few more clicks.

He was a neutral hero.

That was for retail 14 years ago, does not really seem to be enforced on zandalar.

Also enough people with names like "benshapiro" on zandalar.

I’m not supporting a bunch of no life’s bringing the retail experience to classic. No thanks.
---
Omg! As a classic mage, I never charges for water! And never would do it with my dungeon group
---
Work = exp waste
---
straight up a cry baby thread no one will care anything about in 2 months
---
Not very much.
---
The fastest speed run of BfA I could find was a fresh Maghar Orc hunter (so starting at level 20) and it took him almost exactly 24 hours to get to 120. That's including a little over 6 hours to get from 110-120 which a boost wouldn't include. So, my 3-4 110 characters in the time it takes to get one to 60 in classic is pretty damn accurate from a speed running perspective as well.
---
I really wish that wasn't selected by default. I feel like it makes things harder in general, don't know why anyone would prefer it, and just messes up new players.
---
Oh no, I never said I cared. People can do whatever they want, within reason. Doesnt mean they're not stupid for it.

Don't vendor your mats from gathering. Sell them on the auction house or keep them for later. Vendoring won't give you much.

Eh, hunters die so often I wouldn't react if they ran off a cliff by accident.

From a lore perspective, Zhevras use their hooves to attack you so its not a stretch to assume you damage them while fighting them.
---
Upvoted for fishing 🎣
---
Forget about Zhervas missing hooves, how about all those raptors missing heads!
---
Iirc leveling paladin during that time I could solo current level instances. That was fun
---
Keybinds in Classic? Come on now.
---
&gt; and you absolutely do not name an instance after one of the bosses
---
Lots of people in this thread are reporting that this is exactly what happened.
---
And of course there are runs that are named after what you're killing.  Strat Undead (not Strat East), Onyxia (not OL), Emp Run (instead of BRD).
---
Today, what saying "VC" rules out is doing any of the outside undead part.
---
You look at how much more effectively itemized everything is in TBC (where the class mechanics aren't hugely different) and you can see how much of a difference good itemization can make for class identity, so I can believe it.
---
I agree with the mouse suggestion but to answer your question I'd say Mage because they're ranged. Moving and positioning and changing camera is important for melee classes which will be hard for you. And healers will need to heal so you have to be quicker with your pointer. Warlock and Hunter need to command pet which makes it more difficult. Mage for the win.
---
Do we count the 5 man group of level 45 horde camping the road in Duskwood last night on Incendius as wandering monsters?
---
Lol okay buddy. Whatever helps you sleep at night.  Would you mind a rogue needing on your bow just so he can have the agility, knowing he can’t use the weapon?
---
Do it.
---
&gt;	If you draw aggro don’t run around like a headless chicken. Taunt has limited range.
---
Haha, this was my group in Deadmines yesterday. I was on my warlock and the group was just kid of sloppy. Not a lot of focus fire etc.. Anyway, party members kept running around like crazy whenever they would pull aggro. I resorted to using searing pain to pull aggro to me, then I’d go and run the stray mob back to the tank. It was pretty funny.
---
Unsure, but there are currently no level caps for anything.
---
Gordo is actually the minion of one of the forsaken apothecaries at Brill. I'd say that the forsaken are a little more likely to approach a horrific reanimated being with the intention of ...befriending might not be the right word... them, since they're reanimated themselves, where in the eyes of humans, those abominations are, well, abominable. Same with the forsaken as far as many humans are concerned.
---
Immolate, wand, do 40% of the dmg every pull
---
Tapping is faster so you can do more damage.
---
I would rather read this than watch Dave be sad all over Azeroth and then commit kombucha off a bridge .
---
Just watch NinjacoreyTV - while Asmongold had 80k people watching him sleep while waiting for the queue, he had 4 viewers... 
---
He is a wow virgin and playing the game how it should be (with some advice of course from veteran players)
---
I'm using this too, it's fantastic.
---
But there's no such thing as "Dire Maul."
---
not required. I'm doing mining skinning until I'm ready to go eng/alchemy (once my alt is leveled to gather)
---
I'm curious on how people layout their action bar. You are the second post that I saw not use 1 and also have spaces between spells. I just go 1, 2, 3...7 etc.
---
Undersalt
---
Same here !
---
Almost certainly stays in classic. Blizzard said that if classic is a success, they could imagine doing further classic servers like TBC or WotLK classic servers. Those would be separate servers though. The chances of current classic servers transitioning into the next expansion are near zero I'd say.
---
Thanks man, give it a shot and let you know.
---
655 in queue so I still need to post settings.
---
I'm starting to think it's that max fps slider.
---
If I check FPS in game it's like 170...overkill maybe?
---
&lt;apes&gt; have 37 level 60`s in their guild. Dont think theyll be gone in two weeks
---
Yea, if you don't have a dedicated super squad, it's better to at least pretend to be a real tank.  You take so much less damage and have way stronger threat tools with a shield and defensive stance.
---
I forgot how scary red leveled or skull leveled enemies are, especially opposing faction.
---
Either works fine.
---
Wowhead has que times, google it

Same thing happens with /r/RuneScape and /r/2007scape

had the same problem. Get a fan pad, take off the bottom of your laptop. Very carefully without touching any of the motherboard make some contraption to hold it 1 inch above the fan pad. I use bottle caps.
---
What have you been doing with the tons of food and meat from questing?  Your pet shouldn't be that hungry.
---
honestly, i don't think it'll be worth long time to stay in classic (if they're going to stay in classic). in the end, you'll just grind the same raids over and over again

---
I'm sorry I don't even know what arms or fury means. I just click buttons when they show up PLEASE DON'T ROAST ME i'm literally brand new to WoW at all
---
I understand and share your thoughts about being a god to the game. When the game becomes so easy as that, it is boring and you can only fix that by creating a new chatacter.
---
This answer convers a problem that I've seen with WoW and I might consider start playing WoW classic myself. So really,  thanks for the answer ^^.
---
One last thing, is it a monthly payed game like WoW is?
---
Gordo is a friendly Forsaken (horde undead) abomination, much like the undercity guards.
---
Stitches is a very unfriendly Scourge (bad undead) abomination in Duskwood, a leveling area usually used by Alli players north of STV
---
Currently no, but memory still works.
---
Ignore the idiots, a warlock + 2 mages is just fine.
---
You really feel a little like a hero that saved the day after your round a corner, see a 20% Warrior or Rogue with two mobs attacking him and then heal him up.
---
Find other Paladins for the quest. You don't need to clear the whole instance.
---
Have you heard of at will employment? That is the category of employment the vast majority of workers fall under in the US, and unemployment is paid by the government through a tax on employers through a payroll tax. I don't know where you're getting your information from, but it's incorrect.
---
The strength of wow came in two ways - community and the world building. 
---
Forcing people into the world, and to be with people creates distractions.  
---
You’re running to your next quest, you see someone in danger you help them, they thank you, suddenly you’re doing something off script.  
---
The thing is when you’re flying and teleporting everywhere, it’s nice but it removes the value of the world, and you’re interactions with others.
---
Man this would be nice. The Ping would be Bad but it would be fun to Play on the US Servers.
---
And for PvE even the Bad Ping could be OK to Work with 😁
---
Is there a timeline for the phases? Are we talking the same timeframes as Vanilla?
---
Can you please share your talents choice or the guide if you are using one please?  
---
I'm playing rogue, but a have a friend struggling with "auto attack pally"
---
Agreed :D
---
Whats the deal with These Blues? I got one yesterday too are they worth much?
---
Most MMO games built from the ground up, even using a commercial engine like UE or CryEngine, have their own specifically-designed tools and use an existing (an adapted) scripting language like LUA, their own scripting language, or a mix of both.
---
This shit is tired. Let's all pretend it's 2005, but with better latency, memes, and different racism in Barrens. I sincerely hope you post about being pissed when a pally rolls on your int/spirit cloth.
---
I'd say quite a lot having to load all the environments and any and all interactions within the world
---
30-40 your gold ramps up pretty significantly.  Was at like 8g at 30, currently at 30g at 34.
---
There you go. Just pay a visit to AH, it’ll make a huge difference if you can snatch an affordable weapon. Also don’t bother with shields, up until 60 you can tank without one and also without Protection talents. They say Arms is better for pvp so if you’re on a pvp server I’d say go Arms and buy a two-handed weapon on AH until you find something better on your own, perhaps from one of the first dungeons or quests. Actually, there is a pretty cool staff that you get for a Thunder Bluff quest around level 20, for doing Wailing Caverns if you’re horde. I’ve been told it’s OP for its level and all two-hander classes (including mages and warriors) use that staff.
---
No they didn't?
---
For changes that are mandatory for technical reasons, a game designer is needed to determine what the impact on balance would be.
---
Warlock was my main during Vanilla. Soul shards were the bane of my existence and the main reason I won't main a warlock in Classic.
---
People want bots banned, mostly the gambling ones. I've never seen anybody message support because they got scammed.
---
Since wow caters to a more casual playerbase I understand why people might ask for this, but games can implement mechanics to not rely on others trust. When there are no mechanics things like this are bound to happen.
---
So if somebody asks you if you want to run Dire Maul, what are they asking?
---
When you get to Dustwallow run north along the beach. Youll eventually get to an Island inhabited by murlocs, swim around that island. 5 minute run.
---
Had this happen on my Druid yesterday when I hit 20
---
Yes, but since I level BS and Engi at the same time it's a bit slow getting the mats. Kobolds drop the shit I need, for now.
---
Nothing inherintly wrong with either approach btw
---
Not very much, maybe 5mb/hr - but if there's a hotfix or patch put out, those can be much larger and done at any time.
---
Oh, man. The other day I was healing DM with two warlocks. Not the most pleasant experience....
---
Congrats man! Did mine a few days ago and it was a great experience. It was my firs time tanking in classic
---
Why you must play on their server? It's so many others or just select a RP sever or whatever...
---
This is helpful, thank you!
---
Already have it, and the 17 pound catfish.
---
Get weakauras matey, top notch stuff
---
I wouldnt mind because he needs it too
---
It's because the queue went down quicker than I thought while at work, so I created a char and stood in the starting zone for 45 minutes 
---
It's ok I'm now at the back of a 10k queue
---
His reminiscing stories just paint him as an asshole.  He feels like he was in the right for some asinine shit like kicking someone from a pug mc for accidentally pulling a molten giant one time.
---
your role is to heal low people, not ask yourself why he is low. So just heal. 
---
The only thing it changes is that if he is low on purpose healing him is probably not urgent unless you see him draw aggro.
---
Mostly #3.  You don't need as many hunters in raids as you do the other classes, so those that are rolling for dps know better and choose something else instead.
---
Fishing is probably The best skill , paired with cooking in the game if you are a warrior or rogue. Throw some alchemy and herb in there and you’ll always be good. 
---
As a warrior I can consume pots constantly, am self buffed with the food and sell the stuff I do t use for some nice coin.

I did this back in the day and got exalted in the other races in my faction. You can go back to the starting zones at any level and just do the grey quests for the reputation reward. You can also turn in cloth for the associated race.
---
Alternate universe.
---
I would rather they introduced new things very carefully. Even TBC brought new bad things in like flying mounts. They completely negate the exploration aspect of the world. 
---
I'm not #nochanges. But I am #onlysupercarefullyvettedchanges. I think there are ways to improve vanilla, but there should be a hard red line through anything that makes the game easier or anything that makes the game less social. That's why I'm loving classic at the moment. 
---
I think there is room for rebalancing and refining each class identity more. I think they could add more depth to each class without making things easier or taking away character identity.
---
I was about 10 years without playing all night long (7pm to 7am) and i did this last Friday playing wow classic. What im doing with my life??
---
Tank alt, full heirlooms, spend war resources on your main for the xp pots in Boralus/Dazar'alor from the vendor. 
---
Tank is an instant queue and even with complete mouth breathers you can carry the dungeons solo. MoP is also decent but Cata or earlier and Timewalking grind suuuucks
---
Elvui does it well (at last), otherwise classicauraduration is the addon you're looking for. It works with base UI mostly. But then again Elvui does it too now that they debugged the thingy.

I always thought Blizz should post a most wanted list. Anyone that goes over a certain number of lower level kills would automatically go on the list. The person on the list would have a chance of losing a random piece of gear if killed in world pvp. The person with that kill would have the option of taking that piece of gear or leaving it for the guy to keep.
---
What is Layering
---
Layering will be the alternative to the sharding technology in Classic WoW. In short, sharding is a technology used in retail WoW, it distributes players to different versions of zones based on local populations for zones, in an effort to balance players around and create smoother game experiences. However, this technology also separates players and creates awkward phasing situations where players or NPCs suddenly vanish from your screen.
---
In order to maintain an authentic Classic experience, Blizzard had already previously spoken against the presence of sharding in the game. However, as the sharding has been one of the main tools to keep stress periods like patch releases and expansion launches smoothly in recent retail WoW history, they developed an alternative system to deliver the same experience for Classic, which is Layering.
---
Instead of balancing players around shards of zones and combining players from multiple realms, layering will allow realms to create a separate instance of themselves to balance their own population. However, unlike sharding once in a layer, players won't leave this layer in favor of a better one whenever they move or change zones, removing the awkward phasing present in retail. The only way to change a layer will be to enter a group, which will have all players from the group in the same layer.
---
You don't think scammers get reported in rs? Veteran rs players know that scamming is a huge part of the 'culture' of the game and that Jagex won't do anything if you get scammed, but that doesn't mean they don't get reported. Also, there is no customer support for anyone to contact anyway. Blizzard CS has a good track record of helping players though, and they have shown that they can and do punish scammers.
---
Regarding point 2, I agree on the mechanics thing - and they did do that in future expansions in the form of enchanting vellums.
---
I like your way of thinking. Mine was the same. I abandoned my PvE toons on another server after trying my hand on a PvP server. It was so much more fun. I rolled an Orc huntard and had an absolute field day on warriors, paladins, the unaware, and any given gnome I saw running around.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
Classes have talents. They’re passive perks you get while levelling up. They define your build. You start getting talent points from level 10. By default the talent panel is bound to `N`. Check those talents’ description to get an idea for what you can do later on in the game. Basically, Protection talents tree is for using a shield and tanking. Fury got dual wielding. Arms is.. I don’t know. Just Arms.
---
It's not.. why are you so stuborn?  calculated spreadsheet on the front page for fucks sake.
---
Did you abuse this and are now salty?
---
Hey! It has its use, okay?
---
I'm curious about your addons too. Would like the action bar one.
---
I watched a stream for a few minutes before going to work today. A BOE blue shield dropped and they took it as a need for their guild completely neglecting the pugs they had with them.  One guy quit the run and hearthstoned out of there to the confusion of the streamers not understanding that this is ninja looting and very poor form.
---
That's inaccurate. Let's say a rogue pull a pack before you and go full zerg (adre rush + blade fury). You will have trouble getting aggro back right away, so he will take hits. The healer will probably heal the dps though, gaining aggro. You have 0 rage, taunt is on CD, the priest die. Blame the DPS.
---
Play at work? What’s your job ? Hiring?
---
I’m not on their server, but there are hardcores abusing overload mechanics on every server
---
I sold greater magic wands the first day of wine and made over 40g, I’d buy greens for 4-5S and you get 1-2 lessers from them. So essentially I invest 8-10S for a wand that would sell for 30-60s a pop. 
---
I also sold lesser wands at brill for stacks of cloth
---
Even if the weapon is a piece of armor.
---
Wait til you get past 40. When people talk about rough levelling as a paladin, they’re talking about 40-60 :’)
---
My fishing is at 150 and i will buy the +100 fishing item and my pole adds +3  for my daily fishing. I ended up getting a few crates with the chest piece and copper rod. I mostly do it to have a stack of 20 fish for my pet for the day.
---
That's cause they know what they are doing. Try running that with half a team of noobs and see if it's still easy.
---
I see.  What level are you?  At 10 you start getting a talent point every time you level up.  You can put those points into 3 talent trees.  Arms, fury, and prot.  Most lvl as arms (2handed weapon) or fury (1 weapon in each hand).  Prot is obviously 1h and shield.  Up til around lvl 15 or so warrior can be tough.
---
Warrior is definitely the toughest class for beginners.  Probably my favorite class to play though.
---
No. DM is the acceptable abbreviation for Deadmines. If you want to shorten ANY dungeon to its final boss for simplicity, then it is Dire Maul. Why? Because there's three damn dungeons in Dire Maul. Nobody knows what DM means in regards to you looking for a Dire Maul run. You'd need to add an East, West, North or Warpwood, Garden, Gordok anyways. If you need to say LFG DMN/DMW/DME then you're ALREADY freeing up DM for Deadmines.
---
If anything then Dire Maul instances should get the end boss treatment. 
---
ALZ for Alzzin, KG for King Gordok and PT for Prince Tortheldrin. Even keeps you from adding some pesky directions. Problem solved. And if ya don't know who Alzzin, Gordok or Tortheldrin are, well, good thing you gotta farm the fuck out of those dungeons anyways so eeeeveryone can get acquainted with those lovely chaps. 
---
If DM alone is a lazy abbreviation then you may not want to use it to haphazardly describe the one massive dungeon area where using it isn't useful at all anyways. May be easier to just use it for the dungeon that it ACTUALLY applies to.
---
Now I feel dirty because I've asked for renews :(
---
&gt; I just start not healing them
---
why bother joining a group to heal then?
---
The ride never ends
---
Good luck with Sunken Temple.
---
I always thought he was super obnoxious and could never watch his stream for more than a few seconds. Like an entitled child that demanded things from his viewers, and when he didn't get it he throws a temper tantrum and kicks them from group or whatever else.
---
Also, he's really ugly and it hurts my eyes.
---
Exactly
---
I did this way back to ride a wolf as a Tauren. It is a ridiculous kind of effort. Because you can only get so much rep with quests etc. After that it's stacks upon stacks of runecloth you have to donate to a certain npc. Like thousands of stacks (iirc).
---
At most places, you just kinda end up with "senior" at the beginning of whatever your engineering title is after a few years.
---
We mages also get OOM in a quick run, the trick is to gain mana with a gear with a lot of spirit.
---
You need to sacrifice dps to gain mana.
---
This would be amazing, you are a f**ing genius!
---
Lmao trolling general and watching these guys come unglued about retail is a gold mine.
---
Because retail is trash and they want to piggy back off Classics renewed success.
---
Yeah, I just recently learned this shortcut myself. Been using the snipping tool previously.
---
For any hybrid class, do yourself a favor:
---
Level as the DPS spec of your class (or one of the DPS specs).
---
Keep alternative gear for healing and you will be fine healing any dungeon up until around lvl 55.
---
It will make your lvling experience a lot less painful, you'll be able to solo play and still heal just fine in dungeons.
---
An adult would buy appropriate ergonomic solutions when needed, no?
---
Oke seems you are more hopefull then me on this matter..hope you are right.
---
bs and eng both require ore. i'd suggest dropping one so you can gather.
---
eng can be done at 60 after you've crafted your gear.
---
Eloquent comeback. When all else fails personal attacks lol...
---
&gt; You are missing out on the struggle.
---
If that isn't enjoyable to them and they can skip it, they aren't "missing out."
---
Lol sort this sub by top submissions and it's nothing but retail bashing. Maybe it will give you a clue
---
Sadomasochism. I guess you guys just learned your roles.
---
That's amazing I love it.
---
Trap is not even in the macro???
---
Legit just a fishing stream for a while. This is the guy to watch if you want to see a more real classic wow experience. Minus the SM farming he did for a bit.
---
I remember that from leveling one during Burning Crusade. It was a serious, serious grind and it took me AGES.
---
I have not seen a single group ask for anything more than lvl 20+ for deadmines. I got into a group fairly easily at lvl 17. Asomgold is just a whiner, people gave ALWAYS been gatekeeping, it isnt a new thing. Just avoid those groups if they pop up, nobody will take them seriously.
---
Other poster said it was indeed an azeroth hat, thats amazing.
---
Ah yes, the explains the 14k upvote post about how he failed the game. And  the community. And himself. And his parents. And God. And Elton John.
---
Oh man you should have just charged in there spammed a bunch of buttons...used your 5 self heals and finished them off in like 5 seconds
---
As someone who played lock back in the day and is playing priest now, warlocks, please, do not over tap. Tap when you need mana and do not drain your own health so you’re at full mana by the end of the fight. All you’re doing is converting priest mana to lock mana.
---
Literally every time someone asks how to do something. The response is alt f4 and I love it.
---
Gathering skills + sell the mats.   Although everything is flooded right now, prices will go up.
---
Is there anyway to block that shit? Everytime I see it I click "I don't like this channel" but it just keeps coming
---
Fun fact: until top tier gear is widespread Druids will be the most efficient tanks!
---
Its "trade your mana with your healers mana" spell which is ridiculous. I killed myself many times with it just to fuck with my friends calling them noob.

sitting in the lab and this is it
---
Thanks for sharig. Cool story!
---
Proof?
---
&gt; Astral power was a WoD design because Starsurge in times like MoP would prog to uSe because of a crit and wasn’t a resource spender.
---
Astral power was introduced in Legion.
---
WoD boomkin was the constantly-moving balance bar that honestly made for one of the most engaging rotations in the game.
---
But it wasn't *completely* intuitive and baddies didn't feel *totally* in control so they removed it and gated Boomies behind a blue rage-reskin.  Was decent in Legion cause your artifact ability generated a shitload of AsP, now the artifacts are gone it's pretty shit.
---
The decline in quality of the Boomie spec from MoP to BFA is tragic.
---
You convince me and I will give it a try. I believe wow needs a more immersive community and if classic is like you described there is no reason for me not to try it out. 
---
Thank you so much for the answer and thanks to everybody that took time to answer my post. :D

you can do a cast sequence, but i'm not sure how effective that'll be for auto attacks.
---
Make sure to get a auto shot addon so you dont clip your attacks and skills.
---
It's not bullshit retail is garbage, you try speed leveling a Warlock on classic like the faceroll crap in Retail, be my guest.
---
I should put in "". 
---
I know that. 
---
But for mainstream gaming they are nobody, for Twitch they are nobody. (which is sad, but it's slowly changing)
---
Ppl will see that "pro" players from retail won't even get NEAR the pro's in Classic. Method? LOL.
---
r/WoW has become a safe space. I actually got a 24 hour temp ban from there for posting the following comment:
---
&gt; You idiot. Crucible isn't even out yet. It's confirmed at this point that it'll be the same item level as Dazar'alor.
---
How much of an absolute snowflake does one have to be to ban someone for language no worse than what you'd see in a fucking Saturday morning kids cartoon?
---
Also .. at low level you’re not sporting a healer spec, you’re in a levelling spec. So a druid is typically feral spec to get fast movement in kitty, so you can do faster dmg, heals on mana pool, faster movement .. after bear levelling (slow!) you’re excited to finally speed up a bit. Heal is fine in that level range but you’re not getting any heal bonuses or special abilities ...
---
Good dps for a healer?
---
Ahahah a yeeeees man
---
You sound a little salty. I was on beta and submitted bugs that got fixed (got an email the other day to say thanks and that they addressed the issues).
---
I personally enjoy streamers like Asmon and Tyler1 who put on a show each day. I’m not a heavy Twitch viewer anymore but I do enjoy them now and again.
---
fresh player here but yes can relate
---
Grab skinning and just skin everything. I vendor everything right now and make decent money. I also made money yesterday just from buying tangy clam meat from AH, cooking it, and then going to vendor it. This only worked with certain meat as others were outrageously expensive
---
Dwarf paladin! Had to stick the my vanilla roots lol
---
He’s only the undisputed most popular wow streamer on twitch. Ever think maybe you’re the minority? 100k viewers daily and you say “what kind of people watch” 100k people watch.
---
I love you thanks ahaha
---
Lmao our wc tank yesterday kept chain pulling with 2 mages dpsing and a priest healing, we all warned him about pulling while we were oom, finally managed to wipe us on an oom double pull full of casters he couldn't tank, left as soon as he died.
---
The height of horde humor is anal spamming
---
God, these chats keep getting better! Well played :b
---
&gt; virtually no reason.
---
Each warlock that I saw life taping often was top of the dpm during the whole instance. That's one reason when your job is to dps monsters.
---
That’s for sure coming from someone who never played vanilla and doesn’t know how to manage limited classic bag space
---
In Norwegian, "hammer" is indeed masculine gender.
---
It is - you don't like it?
---
I've literally never had a queue or wait time from day one and I played at launch. Then again I am on the oceanic pve server
---
Plenty of nice people whisper real answers while we let others have fun making jokes on a public forum.
---
There is something to say about passive mana regeneration though -- a priest tossing a quick renew will begin regenerating mana much sooner than if they cast a heal.
---
Whether or not this changes the "efficiency" equation, I don't know.
---
Gotta rap between pulls, drinking takes too long and you can’t move while doing it.
---
My whole life has been a lie.
---
thank you !
---
The horde outnumbers us heavily on every server lol. It’s pretty rough.

As someone who couldn’t sub until late MoP, it’s my biggest dream for them to keep going through the expansions again and release more servers. I’ve been having so much fun experiencing Classic for the first time.
---
Alternatively about ten people spamming "LF tank" when there's tons of druids and shamans and the like in the groups.
---
Y'all don't need a warrior to tank unless it's a raid you know?
---
Haha my buddy had it lying around and we wanted to see if it still worked. He's thinking about using it as a second screen on his setup until he upgrades to something better
---
Well I mean they are also the top raiders in the world, and they abused a bug that meant they did not have the raid xp loss and so they did 10 man dungeons to level super quickly.
---
(Also 15 of them weren't at 60 for MC haha)

First time I logged in to BFA I noticed my lock didn't have lifetap as an ability anymore. Logged out and never came back. Mechanics should never be eliminated to make a game easier. The fact that mana isn't an issue for literally anyone in BFA the way it was for classic is just another reason WoW killed WoW.
---
Nope, they work great! Many windows apps don’t detect F13+ but you can use key map software to reassign them to something else if desired.
---
Great - hope you like it!
---
10k ? Not great, not terrible.
---
How about them getting a jump start on world economy. You are defending the wow version of Trumps.
---
🤩🤩
---
Yeah it's pretty shitty. Though I think a lot of people doing it didn't even realize that it was a bug
---
I had a 60 pally main in vanilla, had the epic mount when it was still considered somewhat hard to get. Great quest, expensive and matty. Had a lot of help luckily. Tough leveling as a young kid.
---
wow i feel snubbed, i always buff people with unending breath :/
---
Cheers :)
---
Thousand Needle lifts are fast as fuck.
---
Since you're on a PvP server you pretty much have to prioritize Stamina if you want to win some fights.
---
The first time I played WoW I was enjoying the game too much. I never even thought you could reach max level within a month (unlike other korean mmorpgs back then). It took me 3 expansions to hit max level. 
---
By the time I decided to do all vanilla quests cataclysm happened.
---
Im not repeating the same mistakes.
---
Ok?
---
Prioritise. Don't buy every ability.
---
They literally didn’t abuse anything, they’ve been playing on vanilla private servers for over a decade, they know the ins and outs of every raid and dungeon... who cares if they kill 15 year old content before other people. They’re in the 1%. They don’t effect you in any way shape or form. Play the game how you want to play it, don’t worry about them.
---
Int gives crit only. No spell damage. 
---
+ shadow damage is fantastic however it’s not versatile. It doesn’t increase your mana pool. The other thing is gear with a main stat can have an off stat aswell. Stam or spirit, these add versatility to your character. You can handle you pet loosing agro or pulling more mobs. You stand a chance in pvp encounters where as with straight shadow damage you’re at a disadvantage in that regard. 
---
All in all shadow damage gear while leveling is ideal, if you level in a bubble. However we don’t so maybe mix and match, but I wouldn’t aim for it specifically.
---
The big hate one? Yep, one YouTube search pulled it right up lol
---
I think 6 or 7 for me.  And the pally.  I think others all had at least one more.
---
We did it naked, of course, to avoid the durability damage.
---
It was fun!  Runback from graveyard is a bit of a bitch though.
---
I find it ridiculous how many tanks I encounter do not have their UI set up to be able to easily tell if the healer is out of mana. Yet, they expect to be healed, dispelled, cleansed, etc within 1 second.
---
For me someone that intrigued me was the guy that makes bags for newbies at Razor Hill. He’s too old to fight so spends his time being a lookout and making bags for newbies. 
---
I also think there should be some story behind the guy that lives on top of a hill in the barrens, secluded from everyone with nothing but a tent and a forge, making weapons for the warriors that pass by on class quests.
---
No he didnt. The guy went lw and herb. Means he can sell the herbs. But he doesn’t have skinning to lvl the leather working. So he has to buy those mats from ah. Which isn’t smart. So I ask why he does that cause he seemed to be a newbie
---
I understand people go two gathering profs for the money, but like I said that wasn’t my point
---
I’ve heard a lot of bad things about Paladin. But I really want to play one, but I don’t want to be treated like an outcast later on. What do paladins get good at later down the line?
---
thankfully i’ve got nothing to relate with all these people then
---
Is account sharing against the ToS? While logging in I saw a tip that said it can compromise account security, but nothing about it being bannable.
---
that's exactly my goal, having the burden of drinking on the healer so you can kill things faster.
---
Never been called VC here and up until a few days ago I've never even seen that. Always been DM, because that's what they are. They are the Deadmines. Dire Maul has always been DM+Direction and if you ever wantd to do a full Dire Maul run you'd advertise that as DM full.
---
Yeah that's what I'm aiming to do. Would 2 palas be sufficient.
---
I’m not saying to not tap I’m saying there’s absolutely no reason to tap to full towards the end of a fight when it puts you at risk of being one shotted. There’s an efficient and reasonable way to use life tap

We call kids "weans" here in Scotland so you can borrow that if you like!
---
why do people care this much about streamers? Who cares if you like him? Who cares if you don't like him? None of it matters at all in any way
---
Literally nothing. Depending what you're doing prob around 10-30 mb per hour.
---
Mana to spar isn't a thing, mana is mana and you should use it till you need to drink .
---
r/wow practically enforces shitting on BFA. Only someone who never goes there could ever think that they'd make a rule against it.
---
I don’t think I would do that.
---
One of these days I was buying some mats on the AH listed for less than the NPCs paid for them.
---
I'm not dividing people. You said it was about me and I corrected you.
---
I am not saying the game should be based on how they play it. All i am saying is blizzard should look to these guys for feedback instead of any streamer. Hardcore guilds play the game to triumph and to move on, streamers play the game to be popular. Therefore the perspective of a hardcore gamer will be centered around the game while the perspective of streamers will be centered around themselves.

cant you use those snapjaws for the pet ... but i have the same issues. and i buy all my skills because thats how i play. i have been running for 40 lvls ... wont need a mount at 40 either

---
Yeah I played vanilla and everything but that was a long time ago, I wish more people would take into account that not everyone has spent the last 15 years speedrunning instances. Granted last night I had a pro really help us out, but sone folks don't realize that waiting 10 seconds to mana up saves the 5 minutes it takes to run back.
---
Omg I feel this.. I was doing the Westfall quests where you have to go to Redridge and back just to go to Sw and back etc... And I think I walked most of it bc I didn't want to pay for the flights!
---
I can hear a softy played guitar while reading this.
---
They still fucked it though, in the original game if you stood under a large tree the rain did not go through and it felt as if you was staying dry lol (I live on a RP server)
---
Now the rain just goes through everything :(
---
Here's my current poly macro.
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /script if UnitExists("mouseover") then SetRaidTarget("mouseover", 1) elseif UnitExists("target") then SetRaidTarget("target",1) end
---
    /stopcasting
---
    /use [@mouseover,harm,exists] [@target,exists] Polymorph
---
If you've got a mouseover target it'll put the Icon on them and poly them, if not and you've got a target it'll instead poly that target and put the raid icon on them instead.
---
You can add something like /e is polymorphing the target with a Star if you want to warn your group.
---
I'll have to check them out.
---
I'd be happy with either path for expansions, new would be cool, but I have very fond memories of everything up to Lich King.
---
I would like to see them introduce an OSRS style poll system for new features/ introduction of retail features.
---
I doubt, regen is only important during fight and so far combats are very fast so it doesnt really matter.
---
Play what you wanna enjoy homie
---
Good fuck the Horde. Proud mother fuckers

Hey all. Krug wrote an excellent guide for the Warrior class in Classic. It includes a recommended Arms leveling talent build and instructions on prioritization.
---
I saw a similar graphic to this one for Frost Mages, which is my other main Classic class. I found the graphic helpful as a quick reference while playing, and wanted one for the Warrior. So here it is!
---
**Neither the build nor the guide are my own. I just created the graphic.**

Until you post what you got banned for I'm gonna assume you were flame baiting.
---
You’re lucky you were still alive. I’m pretty sure there was a bug at one point where if you logged out on a flight you’d respawn in the air and fall to your death.
---
Improved charge is incredible whilst leveling, deep wounds/impale are not very useful until you get ur crit up
---
Curse bitches who get a chance at loot vs a dime a dozen mages

oh i just vendor it

So is the quest to kill Van Cleef.
---
I'm not at home right now and can't check.  
---
But I think it's under Plugins. Might only be visible in a new window.
---
Bad warlocks don't life tap
---
Yeah we do this because we're so breathtaking as a class, you never know, someone might suffocate looking at how cool our mounts are.
---
You're a hairy, wizzard!
---
Well, it's not the players that kill you.  It's the shitton of guards.  In fact we ganked a handful of level 10-12 horde just outside the instance entrance as they were leaving and entering.
---
Your time has come
---
healing.
---
I mean let’s call it what it is.
---
Most of the people who came back to WoW for Classic fell out of love with it at some point. So you’ve got like six expansions that they could have dropped out at.
---
For instance, I loved Vanilla, was okay with TBC, hated Druid healing in Wrath so I rerolled and enjoyed it. Cataclysm was good in theory I thought, but my last experience was with Mists of Pandaria. My interest died quickly and I stopped playing. So I have no experience with Warlords of Draenor, Legion, or Battle for Azeroth.
---
Those expansions could all be amazing, but I don’t know. I still laugh at the memes comparing Retail to Classic.
---
For people playing Retail and loving it though, you just see a bunch of new people shitting on it. They like some old game where you can’t have your goddamned Tauren Paladin. You can’t fly and have to constantly worry about getting ganked?! Sounds awful.
---
Pretty sure they trademarked “race to world first”.  Could just be internet bull shit tho.
---
Update: Apparently this wasn’t part of Vanilla just as I remembered since they had to hotfix experience gains yesterday afternoon when running as a 10 man. 
---
Shortly thereafter, trade chat 10 man spam collapsed like a dying star.
---
Taping end of fight is actually the most important, so your group can pull the next monsters with a dps up while the healer is drinking behind.
---
As a rogue I always break for casters and warriors, they have agro and my quick tap of a full energy bar from behind takes off 3/4 health in 2ish globals.  Most cheer and buff but in my world that’s how Rogs buff others, that quick assist!
---
No it is simply a fact that the version they introduced for classic is much much much easier than vanilla launch version.
---
Sorry if you can't accept that.
---
You have 30g at level 10??? How you do it?
---
You guys even roll need on a caster’s outrage. You have no shame.
---
You thought highly of Asmon?  Excellent shitpost.
---
Hey guys. Best place to find info for a complete first timer? I started a human rogue and I have no idea what I'm doing.
---
I'd recommend using this great tool:
---
 [https://www.wowdownrank.com/](https://www.wowdownrank.com/) 
---
Otherwise I don't know of a specific in-game addon.
---
But honestly downranking for raw mana efficiency is useful only at level max with really decent gear. If you don't have a crapton of healing power downranking is useful only to avoid overhealing, which no addon can help you with since it's just about adapting to the situation.
---
Also all spells get more mana efficient as they rank up period. You gain mana efficiency by downranking only thanks to really high healing power values making cheap spell interesting to use compared to more expensive ones because the difference in health given is lower the more healing power you have while the mana cost is still significantly smaller.
---
Right now at lvl 26 as a Shaman I keep one rank 1 healing wave for emergency/no mana situation, my highest healing wave rank and a lesser healing wave for smaller heal or fast healing.
---
Also you never want to use the quick cast ranks when you have healing power as they have really terrible healing power ratios (the proper healing ratio starts only at the maximum cast duration for every spell).
---
Legion was the best wow has ever been. Felt more like a druid there than I ever did playing classic/BC and the gameplay is...well...a decade ahead of classic. I like the organic world of Classic wow, but it's got way too many downsides to compete.
---
Make sure you're not putting righteous fury up
---
ARCANITE REAPER! *HOOOO*!
---
This probably goes without saying but make sure you don’t have righteous fury on! ;)
---
On my server, I just decided to take over the 8 slot bag market. I bought everything that was under my price, and had a 2 page wall with my name on it in AH for woolen bags of any color. They’re around 3s to vender, most people throw them on the AH for 10-15s. I scooped up everything, on top of making a around 20 myself, and put everything up for 20s.
---
I just refuse to group with hunters

---
I'm British, 22 years old,  
---
Would like to meet some new people and find someone to quest with some days of the week.  
---
I'm new to WoW but I've got a few characters to 15+ already.
---
If you'd like someone relaxed to level with, hit me up! We'll jump in a discord call and go slap some boars.
---
You should be chain pulling on a Hunter. Your pet damage and your auto shot should be enough to kill any mob at level.
---
I laughed way too hard at this, really looked like a pack Q
---
Yes it does. You can't nerf something that wasn't working as intended.
---
I never expect healer to heal me after I life tap, I sometimes tell the healers to not to heal me after I life tap because it’s just waste of mana for them. I can life drain, cannibalize,bandage myself.
---
Sta spi bis!
---
Mana regen starts 5 seconds after you cast your last spell, and health regen starts when you leave combat.
---
Asmongold viewed it on stream and people upvoted as a meme.
---
Please tell me you have this guy on a list somewhere.. we need to start holding people accountable for this petty shit because I'm sure it cost you and your group 30+ minutes to find another person
---
I just done think most people understand the difference between what apes did and what most people are even willing to attempt.  
---
And everyone needs to stop comparing their experience with other peoples, at least with streamers and progamers.  There is plenty of prep work to do, and just because they did it faster and more organized doesnt really impact anyone else.
---
Paladins are an amazingly powerful class but are unable to do some things for themselves, some love it some don't. 
---
For PvE they provide the best buffs in the game so anyone will be happy to have you for group content. They are a hybrid class but only perform well at healing. People will still bring a dps paladin to groups but a good ret pally should understand that is not a damage roll, it's a support and utility roll that tries to do as much damage as possible while not being support. You can tank 5 man dungeons, especially undead ones, but it might be challenging if you are newer to the game. Levelling wise they get flack for being boring and slow levellers because the kill speed is slow and spell rotation simple. However, you have a diverse spell kit and if you learn to use it you never die and never have down time.
---
That point is a good transition to pvp paladins. You NEVER die, you can almost never kill anyone either though. I'd say paladins are one of the less capable classes when solo but the most powerful addition to any group/duo.
---
Classic is a true MMORPG, seeing people spam general begging for new layers is detaching.
---
I'm well aware by now, but I've really been enjoying the game, hope you have aswell!
---
It's where the boat to Menethil Harbor de-spawns. The chairs for one of the boats stuck around.
---
In original Vanilla I only focused on professions and forgot to level up....
---
Lmfao the internet sure has some dumb people
---
Captain Reddit police: Umm actually that’s against the TOS letting an unauthorized non family member access the account. 
---
The rest of us: Fuck off.
---
Hearthstone PTSD kicks in
---
I have rezzed so many players now.. the corpse runs are something else
---
I find the most giddy happiness anytime I do this to somebody.
---
Ah, you are one of those that claim that this isn't the totaly real Classic because it isn't starting with the way inferior 1.0 version. Got ya.
---
&gt; reality of it is they aren't playing a very similar game at all.
---
Oh god.
---
Never understood this mindset. You're punished because you didn't have a dedicated group of friends and took time off? The mantra has been 'exploit early, exploit often' for decades now.
---
&gt; You would literally have to have at least one game designer to make high level decisions.
---
Kevin Jordan said on C2C that they didn't have a game designer on the WoW:C team. And there was none in the credits IIRC. That's why I brought it up.
---
shouldnt have needed to "warn us"
---
You know I'm not actually mad at all.
---
We don’t it’s fun. lol
---
In all seriousness I’m always very respectful of my group members
---
First dungeon is a horde dungeon from level 13. In orgrimmar (RFC)
---
After that theres wailing caverns in the barrens. I would say level 17 for that place.
---
As for professions..
---
Priests use cloth so i would not bother with leatherworking or blacksmithing. 
---
But consider either:
---
Tailoring and enchanting
---
Or herbalism and alchemy
---
Alternatively you can get tailoring and herbalism.
---
Tailoring requires cloth, looted of humanoid enemies. And so you dont need a gathering profession for it.
---
Herbalism is for alchemy - and like... 2 enchanting recipes. But they can sell in the AH for a nice penny.
---
Enchanting requires you to disenchant magic items for materials.. not useful at all for levelling IMO. Its an end game profession.
---
Also Root the runners! Those 20 minute fights because someone enemy wants to run into the middle of the base, are exhausting.
---
ten storms eu has never had queues! prove me wrong
---
Dansgaming is pretty comfy, he is just questing around as a gnome mage.
---
Ya kinda feels like cheating when you automate it. Macro to shift rank based on button press seems fair. 1 button for 3 ranks of a spell. 1 press u get rank 3. Shift+1 gets rank 5. Alt+1 gets you rank q of the spell. You only end up using 1 key bind slot.
---
I find priest's mana pool has 2 speeds in RFC, WC, BFD, RFK etc.
---
Speed 1 - Full always - I'm not using damage spells and just wanding and nothing crazy is going on. Heals don't outpace mana regen.
---
Speed 2 - Empty - Either the tank is made of paper AND the DPS isn't letting them build aggro (like with a lower level tank and lots of parries on sunders/resists on taunts), or we just pulled about 10 mobs.
---
Point being, there's not really a middle ground where my mana is going down 30-40% a pull and I should be doing more to compensate.
---
Just got my hammer and it is sooo worth it! All you need is first boss, 2-3 man group should be good enough. Get a pally or two like the others said. GL
---
TFW you are tanking and the dps instantly attack the mobs that you are not currently targetting.
---
I lvl with my friend Who’s a rogue. I find solo leveling as a priest before 35-40 absolutely horrible. So i recommend grouping up as you have a nice synergy with alot of classes.
---
There is many players around the world.
---
U need to talk to other players if u want to go dungeon. 
---
Everything matter, with that low stats even basic food is helpfull crafting greens are good 
---
Killing basic mobs is harder
---
Many of this will be gone later but now we have 60lvls of content
---
On retail .. there is tons of daily shit u must do .. daily daily daily .. Blizzard do this instead of making New content for years (when u pay monthly fee.. it cost u every 5months like New game and there is not that much New content .. ofen travel back in time and so same content or New map with daily .. I hate daily stuff)
---
Nice one, forgot the "Humor" flair tho. Other than that, top notch.

To be fair, if a rogue or warrior pulls one in an multi pull, I’ll let you have it for a few seconds :p give the warrior some rage, give you some procs, we all happy :)
---
High damage /slower speed weapon in your mainhand because certain abilities (eg. Sinister strike) scale off your mh weapon damage (rather than its dps).
---
Honestly, leveling fishing with my morning coffee has been so relaxing. It’s therapeutic almost.
---
Me too, crazy stuff
---
Hey I'm a new player I just wanted to ask if there comes a month that i stop the monthly payment, do i lose access to my character until I pay again, or does my character get deleted and I have to start over again?
---
The point in classic wow is what ever you want it to be :)
---
You take shit way too serious rofl. Who gives a fuck what HE does with HIS own time.
---
Bfa is retail and comments like this would get deleted / you temporary banned
---
&gt;It's not bullshit retail is garbage, you try speed leveling a Warlock on classic like the faceroll crap in Retail, be my guest. 
---
I just got this in my inbox on this subreddit
---
Enjoy!
---
Mages weren't. They were actually really bad DPS.
---
Auction house?
---
“Don’t question anything devs do guys, they know what’s right.”
---
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.
---
&gt; Well, I think they "just" need to take the well received gameplay changes from BC/Wotlk and then add new content. 
---
That's MUCH harder than you make it seem to be here.
---
And now you got no money for your mount 😂
---
Fantastic I can put that next to my other character boost so it has a friend.
---
I feel like this constantly. Sorry, but I'm not paying 2s to res you. Lol.
---
Skeram PvP server. I actually didn’t fish much at all in STV. I got max fishing while getting some firefin snapper in Dustwallow Marsh in fact.
---
I know, the problem is most of the 20 skills I will use. Blizzard, blink, water, evo, poly, frostbolt. Teleport IF and SW. Probably mana shield.
---
Oh gotcha
---
*  cries in autohit  *
---
Also the 2s for the reagent cost.
---
Your assumption is that the rest of the group also doesn’t need to eat or drink. How often is this actually the case?
---
My point is that when the rest of the group is resting after a couple of pulls and the lock is sitting on a full mana bar and almost empty health bar because of over tapping they should take it upon themselves to do what everyone else is doing and eat, bandage, or somehow heal yourself. You should not be using the healer as a battery.
---
I hat a priest in my party yesterday who would bubble me at the start of fights and used renew almost exclusively to heal me up. 
---
I started giving out tips to the healer (basically exactly your post) and he ignored me. We had to wait multiple times for our priest to mana up!! Made our dungeon run so slow. I wish he saw this post lol
---
It was the FPS foreground and background sliders not being enabled causing the issue!
---
Hah ! Suck on that, computer maintenance !
---
Herb becomes valuable around level 35 when you can pick Fadeleaf (Swamp of Sorrows has a lot of it). Rogues need Fadeleaf to use their Vanish skill. And then later when you are picking end-game alchemy herbs like Mountain Silversage they can sell for 20g/stack on the AH. I did this on several chars back in Vanilla and was able to get epic mounts within a week or two of hitting 60.
---
&gt; LOL Legion was awful.
---
You could back this up, or you're just blowing hot air. Questing mobs in Legion had more depth than MC bosses.
---
I didn't find a use for it yet. I tend to use 2,3 and 4 more since they are easier to reach for me. 1 is for a less used ability. For the drinks; one is a spell to create drinks, next to it the actual drinks. and the others are just health potions! :)
---
No what i said. 
---
The idea of a professional streamer spending 6+ days of total uncompensated play time for an so-called *authentic* experience is beyond belief.
---
How else are you going to aggro the 60s? ;)
---
I'll join you in karma hell. Anti asmongold post = mass free karma, pro/indifference = whyevencarebro. 
---
Sub for a game proud of community goes to great lengths to shit on a guy because it's fashionable right now. 
---
Tirades of insults on his person are all okay because you were forced to read his name on a subreddit against your will, crikey.
---
Game settings are probably cranked up
---
what talents?
---
Same issue here.
---
I doubt it, while it isn't technically allowed it is an incredibly commonly known exploit and there's no way Blizz was unaware of it. Considering it was left in for Classic, it is likely okay to visit it. Besides, some people did it live on stream and were fine, unless you actually use it to gain an advantage it's okay. I've explored a METRIC TON of out of bounds areas over the years and have never gotten in trouble, just never use it for an actual advantage.
---
37 human mage was trying to AoE at Go'Shek in Arathi yesterday. Little old 30 me was waiting inside the barn until he pulled the mobs
---
There was "move anything" but i am unsure if it has been released for classic
---
I've just been leveling in silver pine and then barrens. I wanted to experience both areas. Most guides in sure would say go to the barrens I'm sure since there is a ton to do.
---
Clearly not. I totally didn’t get that vibe when you called people pretentious asswhipes lol
---
Sure but this also isnt 2004 where people had lower expectations from their MMORPGs.
---
Some people don’t enjoy having what they’re doing trivialized by mechanics they’ll never be able to use or are otherwise against the spirit of the game.
---
I skipped Starfire!
---
The jokes that didn't exist in 2004.  Top kek
---
At the end of the day, he's only one person and it's impressive how much one man can do, and as a person who has watched him for a long time and has even given an actual sub, he has made my Classic WoW experience amazing.
---
​
---
Asmongold spent years ( as did a lot of people ) begging blizzard to release classic wow servers, For many reasons..
---
community.
---
the leveling experience.
---
the RPG elements that disappeared throughout the years..
---
fun.
---
the old zones.
---
Grouping up with other players all the time...
---
There are a million reasons we all wanted Classic WoW but I think it's really great we have finally gotten this opportunity to reexperience the glory days in a new way. As a community.
---
They spent YEARS saying " WE'RE FINALLY GOING HOME BOYS!!! " " WOW IS ALIVE AGAIN " .. " WOW IS BACK BABY "
---
...And he built a community of people working together.
---
...And he is helping people with dungeon runs and gearing
---
...And he is displaying Classic in a way most people will never be able to experience it.
---
...And he is making sure his guildies get the gear they need when raiding becomes a thing.
---
...And he's paving a path for others to power level in the multiple different ways they want.
---
...And he has been as consistently entertaining and even putting his stream before his own enjoyment of the game. 
---
You had a second chance to relive Classic WoW and you threw it all away just to entertain and bring together the community. 
---
You even rolled a PvP server knowing it would be more annoying for you because you knew it would be better content for your stream. 
---
You asked for legacy servers for years but when they came around you delivered the most consistent and quality WoW Classic stream for HOURS a day for days straight! 
---
At the end of the day, Who cares he's just one person. But as a top WoW streamer, it's fantastic. I've never felt more like part of a community. 
---
You have made Classic WoW so much better for so many people. You have inspired your fans to work together fans, and most of all, you have brought yourself to new heights and I'm thoroughly impressed.
---
We always knew you would do it.
---
You're amazing.
---
Make sure you always have Thorns on, it’s a HUGE boost to threat gen too
---
You just lose access to being able to play until you re-subscribe. All your progress will still be there when you come back.
---
hello! what chat addon do you use?
---
good arguement
---
I also hate these moments.
---
I just call them a dick and move on.
---
Fun note, dick is not censored!
---
Bosses would die so fast it wouldn't matter.
---
But yes a lot of times you'd skip bosses unless you needed gear.
---
Jesus, use the print screen button.
---
What's layering?
---
To really understand this, just think; blizzard didnt make a new game for a long time and just kept working on WoW. For years WoW was all they did. Of course its better than other MMOs.
---
That would be because the ability wasn't added until Wraith of the Litch King. Not sure why it was put on the vanilla-wow version of the wiki. If you look at the ability on a retail wow wiki page it shows when it was added in patch 3.0.8
---
Wiki page: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Swipe_(Cat)
---
Please tell me theres actually an add on that tells you if its world first
---
Anal [Rend]
---
Even if it's a war, it makes sense to me the fact of having a WANTED list of the enemy faction. By the way, we already have this (from a game design point of view) while leveling through "wanted" quests, but they are only badass NPCs. Definitely a feature like this would be super fun, even providing hints about player location, last honorable kill registered etc, to track them easily, it will encourage player to do some world pvp.
---
Oh god the WoW drama.
---
I can picture your children working through their trauma on the schoolyard when they and their friends talk about how annoying their parents are. "Yesterday they argued for AN HOUR because my mother needed on a staff that my dad wanted. WHILE Becky was there for dinner. I wish I would just die!"
---
If you wanted an epic flier, you had to do dailies for weeks.
---
Ignore him. One born every minute.
---
Lmao
---
I don’t know where “here” is but I can assure you that on Anvilmar, Dalaran, and Bloodhoof it was called VC.
---
Not necessarily as much but a lot more than classic
---
You know what i got for you bunch of cutters?
---
Renew.
---
And not a single fucking heal more.
---
Love playing wow as a healer btw, so enjoying all of this.
---
all about that skinning yo. Vendors pay out the ass for leather for some reason.
---
Hah, this happened to me yesterday. I was killing murlocs and overpulled so i became close to dying then booom - PW:Shield + Renew and I was back in business! Shout out to all of you kind priests!
---
I honestly feel bad because I know that I will, at some point, have to get my priorities straight and go raid to save the world. But I could honestly just skin animals and craft leather gear forever.
---
This is very accurate, 
---
But still,
---
Damn whippersnappers!
---
Did you even play vault of glass, Kings fall, last wish and wrath of the machine?
---
These elite private server guilds like Apes have classic down to a science.  What we saw was like watching ~35speedrunners do a 5day marathon and you just can't compare that to the average player.  You can't even spawn Rag without 8 coordinated players getting enough rep.  Onyxia attunment is probably an 8hr quest chain as well.  It will take even a semi hardcore guild a month at least to clear MC.
---
You have to find your own group for dungeons by asking other players typically in general chat in the zone the dungeon is in or a major city. For example, Shadowfang Keep is in Silverpine Forest so you would type in general chat (/1) "LFG SFK" while in Silverpine or Undercity. Unlike retail everyone in the group also bas to run to the dungeon enterance, don't be that a-hole that makes 4 people wait at the enterance 20 mins for you to run halfway accross the world (unless you've told them you'll need time to get there and they are ok with waiting, it's a social game after all).
---
As far as level, there are dungeons available at almost all levels, as low as 13 for ragefire chasm. You can ask chat about dungeons to do at your lvl and wherw to find them. You'll also find yourself picking up quests that ask you to go to a dungeon. When those questd turn yellow in the quest log, then you're probably about the right lvl for that dungeon
---
The 15k upvote post trashing him says otherwise.
---
Why should the healer pay for everyone's drinks?
---
I remember finding this out the hard way. went to make my lunch to return to a dead dwarf. Took me ages to work out why 😂
---
Can we legit just stop? No one gives a fuck but someone has to make 10 anti-streamer threads a day so you lot have to make 10 pro-streamer threads a day and it's just stupid.
---
So what that Asmon is going to use an army of players to grind his scarab lord, or buy his epic mount for him because he cba, if you rolled on their server you should just GTFO because you'll be a guild of people fighting an army of 4000+.
---
So what he can form any party instantly, be given anything he wants at a request, etc etc. It has no impact on my ability to play the game on an entirely seperate server lol.
---
The legion fishing artifact was one of the coolest things in any recent WoW expansion. It felt off the beaten path, with not too many people knowing about it. I loved people wondering how the hell I was turning into a fish.

Bad bot.

How to partially add this to retail: if not in pvp combat, spells don't dismount you.
---
&gt; and left PoE too
---
By that you mean switched to streaming Classic when it launched, yea?
---
At least they aren't pussies who get scared of online crowds, but keep calling other people names.
---
Pick the second. Servers are too full for effective AoE-grinding. And the protetction talent reckoning does not work like it did on private servers where protpala AoE-leveling was the fastest way to 60. Just go retribution with a fat 2-handed weapon.
---
InB4 this mans get fired!

Is there a way to enable it? I have Elvui now and am setting it up now but it’s not showing up.

How do I find the template for this?

I set wow to run with the fast vsync option in the Nvidia settings, I get framerates higher than my monitor can display but without lag or tearing.
---
Enchanting and Tailoring go hand in hand, and will net you some good gear as you level. For Horde faction the first dungeon is Ragefire Chasm which is conveniently located inside of Orgrimar. It's level 10 to enter but recommended to be 12-15 for an easier time. Go into Orgrimar and use the /1 channel to say "Undead Priest LFG for RFC" or respond to one of the many people that will be asking "LFM RFC Need Heals"
---
I know that Int doesn't increase your spelldmg. That's what makes it so difficult for me to gauge the benefits of one stat against another. So if we break it down to the very basics, the one thing that every stat does is reduce the time you spend levelling. So then the real question is: Do you save more total time by 
---
1) having a large mana pool plus critchance (which is pretty poop given the fact dots can't crit in classic, unless you're destro)
---
2) having higher damage output with increased spelldmg
---
3) dying less because of lots of stamina.
---
I was hoping someone had a better idea than me and my gut feeling..
---
We are not comparing.  What we are saying is casual like myself look forward to farming the dungeons like UBRS, LBRS, BRD, Scho, Stra even Maru weeks after weeks to get certain item that were meaningful and it  played crucial role on raid. These items are now less important if not completely useless.  I did come back to classic so things are not handed over to me but for a challenge.  That challenge part is substantially reduced.  MC was easy now it is even easier. Many people don't understand the changes in 1.13. Casters are all with 50% mana left end of fight.
---
And another thing, Fuck hunters and their feign death giving me a heartattack every third minute.
---
Wait I thought bfa was a better game? How can this be?
---
I did this with skinning, ran up behind someone and skinned his bear, actually feel bad about it two days later :(
---
And she played the shit out of runescape... lol
---
Good fucking question. I helped a guy with a guild charter and got 5s out of that, but I spent it on a wand immediately so it’s gone. Otherwise, I guess it’s just from selling all the junk I get. Vendor trash goes for surprisingly high if you’ve got enough of it.
---
Less abilities?...
---
Next you'll be telling me Ragnaros has legs.
---
I remember watching classicast with him once and he said he wouldn't take any donations until after he got his epic mount on his own hard work.
---
Didn't even make it to level 45 before he started... For a guy whose brand is "always go big dick"  it's a pretty limp dick move. Wants Classic because it was challenging but can't handle the work it would take to get a level 40 mount.
---
For the record I really wouldn't care much if he had not said on a podcast that he wouldn't lower himself to doing that until he had put in the work himself.
---
"Classic doesnt have to compete its beating the crap out of Retail" you know the games been out for a week right? By that logic every game that has hit the top of twitch ever is the biggest game in existence
---
Imagine that you’re an officer in a raiding guild.
---
It’s raiding night and 45 people are available for MC.
---
Do you really want to pick the 5 guys in greens if you have the choice ?
---
Don’t forget that most set items are garbage for a lot of classes, and some prenis item last until AQ40.
---
Asmobugger should be quiet. Blizzard do not listen community, they only listen money and last Blizzcon was rough for shares price .. thats why they did anything .. + they wanted to end all free servers
---
Yeah, no, unless you wanna level up in dungeons you're doing yourself a disservice by not going combat until 60.
---
2 rows! shadow word pain...
---
we are on 1.13 so normalization is in effect. Its not as prevalent as it used to be (there are brackets for speed per weapon type, rather than by item), but low speed is better still in main hand (more straight dmg from abilities) and fast weapon on off hand (increased attack speed)
---
Yeah, I loved BC and wotlk was cool too. After that I just hated it. I don't even want to go down that road, so id love for a new spin off -- completely different. Never introduce flying, no LFR/Mythic crap, etc
---
&gt;  I just start not healing
---
You mean you stop healing?
---
+shadow damage is huge for affliction. Fully dotting someone, then popping off a fear will pretty much drop them to zero. I wouldn’t worry about losing to rogues too much, if they get the opener it’s hard to come back from that. Just always keep a SS and HS up so after they unload and kill you, you can pop back up get to full health, and take them down. Without their cool downs they’re nothing. That shadoweave set has a bunch is stem, and shadow dmg, make a tailor friend and get a full set
---
I think it's 14 seconds but I'm barely awake so someone correct my math if need be.
---
Mount cast time = 3
---
Ghost wolf cast time = 1
---
Ghost wolf headstart time = 2 seconds
---
Ghost wolf speed = 1.4
---
Mount speed =1.6
---
Epic mount = 2
---
Speed difference = .2
---
Epic speed difference = .6
---
Ghost wold headstart distance = 2 * 1.4 = 2.8
---
Time to catch  regular mount = 2.8 / .2 = 14 seconds
---
Time to catch with Epic mount = 2.8/.6 = 4.67 seconds
---
It's like the easiest version of vanilla, it would be like starting vanilla right before tbc came out essentially lol.
---
As a tankadin I just hate this quest for not offering an 1h weapon...
---
Currently have a druid, is this talent tree the most optimal for leveling? 
---
Just guess tbh, this was a day ago so maybe people are reaching 25 but I'm at level 30 and haven't seen most people on my server 30 and above
---
Server identity won’t be a thing with overcrowded layered fresh servers. The more players you have, the less names matter, and layers make all of that even worse since people can virtually never meet you ingame and play with other people all the time if they want to. 
---
Big PServers had this “lack of identity” issue too. Every week a new warrior from a guild nobody ever heard about got Thunderfury. It’s vastly underwhelming and it’s one of the main reasons why I’m against giant populations caps on Classic.
---
the game was designed by modern western people. no shit its going too follow similar rules.
---
but even if you assume that were using some wild west type shit, then your still basically at war. (across history people have always just been invading each other, sometimes it didnt last long enough to even be called a war. but it was still functionally war.)
---
i like how so many people want to prove me wrong "well in lore says" bullshit, if you run into a horde town as an alliance. regardless if your on a PVP, RP or PVE server last i checked those npc's will delete you. even 100's of years ago, guards didnt just randomly attack people who entered there towns. UNLESS they were at war.
---
lore means nothing when the game directly disproves that. this isnt some small scale thing, like a class having a skill in game they dont have in lore. were talking about a faction v faction war.
---
in game mechanic's trump an oversight from the lore team. (lore teams fuck up continuity every single time. im looking at you overwatch lore team)
---
and lastly, we can draw parallels between irl and azeroth. why? because the entire thing is an allegory for the original invasion of america.
---
the future americans (humans) came too the 'new land' (azeroth) and met the natives (orcs) and shit didnt go so well.
---

How to farm karma on reddit: begin your post with “This will probably get downvoted to hell”.
---
You have to go in nameplates and then tweak stuff. There's a lot of you can mess with so explaining here would take forever. But look at the debuff tab of Enemy NPC, and in the general tab check the conditions for showing nameplates. By default they never change so you decide whether to display them or not (press ALT + V to display them all if you haven't changed that keybind), but then you can decide to display them only in battle for example or things like that.
---
I've never played wow before this and here I was feeling well off with my 30 silver.
---
Neat.
---
&gt; why bother joining a group to heal then?
---
There are still 3 others in the group.
---
Taurens a few doors down from bank on good ol' Thundy Bluff
---
CB/hemo/prep is a fine leveling spec. Reserved more for gold farming and pvp at 60 but still very serviceable.
---
This meme has been overused and is not longer funny, just stop. Thank you.
---
I think you missed the part where I said "open world", but that's okay, because I wasn't really clear that I meant "*in a group* in the open world", which is where the whole tank/heal/dps thing comes in as a Druid depending on how much we pull. 
---
With just a Warlock or Paladin and a Druid questing, the roles are blurred and you all do different things depending on how you pull. I don't really get that from retail WoW because it's super easy even just with one person, even though I'm going to press *a lot* more buttons on retail as I cycle through the exact same rotation I use in open world, dungeons, and raids.
---
Just hit 30 on my shammy, very relatable.

Never said what kind of designer. Might be a technical designer which is exactly what you would need for a remake/remaster.
---
My mac tries to update or reinstall classic everytime i open battle.net. then it realises its installed and lets me play. 5min annoyance everytime xd
---
I tried the other specs and combat is just so much better. Yes, the other talents are beneficial, but the combat ones are even more so.

I was putting those up to help people out...
---
Yes exactly! Agi is really good for the crit chance &gt; flurry procs. But you will always find people who prefer str for pure AP and they will argue it’s more consistent than hoping for crit, so chose what you prefer, anything goes during leveling phase!
---
In that specific scenario I’d go with the first chest. For other situations like that I’d recommend that you think for a bit about how you want to play and what struggles you’re facing. Do you die a lot? Maybe get some more stam. Is killing mobs really slow but you’re not really at risk of dying? Maybe go for some agi/str for more dmg output! Again it comes down to personal preference, some people like to play it more safe where others like to go in and slam some faces hoping you kill them before they kill you!
---
As a priest I can safely say that I'm going to be letting a lot of warlocks and mages (and any other dps) die because of overenthusiastic dps ing.
---
We know.

They ain't rollbacking shit. Every person was on equal footing. You had the same amount of time to abuse the bug as everyone else.
---
I got this exact hat on ah last night 👌
---
You can’t be serious, this sub is just as bad as any other.
---
Offhand weapon should be faster and therefore usually less dmg per hit. As far as I remember, your offhand is what you should be using to apply your more dps focused poisons. More hits = more chances to apply your poisons. So MH slow, offhand fast.
---
Those things intimidate me
---
Why is your game broken? Floating ground in the background and holes in the world

Thank you for the advice! I’m guessing that’s a slow 3.5s+ 2h?

Don’t cha know that D and D have been writing the storyline for WoW for years?

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cyr1qd/noob_question_whats_retail_i_see_people_talking/). 
---
I’m sorry .. what?
---
Man some of the scenery is just fantastic.
---
I always feel so bad for the Healers when I life tap after a mob pull is done. Don't worry about me, I'll eat food to heal, just lemme get my Mana by killing myself quickly, saves on getting water and stuff
---
Who is going to come off better when you are out in the wild and you meet another mage lvl 60 pre bis, vs you in greens? Gear matters a lot more in Vanilla PVP than retail. 
---
Also there are only a few drops per boss meaning it can take you months to get raid BIS. Gives you something to do in between raid days.
---
Its fucking insane that people are so obsessed with streamers that they'll work their asses off irl and in game just to send it all to some narcissistic streamer who couldn't give a shit about them, honestly feel bad these people
---
I'm not agreeing with stopping to heal a life tapping warlock as long as the run goes smoothly and the WL doesn't just make me throw money out of the window from making me dring so much, but you asked and I answered. 
---
I keep the group going. It's not whack-a-mole but when I'm not constantly ooming myself on a Warlock, I can actually keep the group going at a quicker pace than if they took a pseudo healer (enhancer without any int or spirit on his gear e.g.) to throw the tank heals and then ate after every other pull.
---
You run a wing. Usually takes an hour or two. Then you can find a new group for another wing. No one in the right mind runs the entirity.
---
Warlocks that aren’t situationally and life tap whenever the fuck they want are the worst.
---
Nah.. I have left all the chests behind that I have seen. Even in the dungeons I don't roll for em. 
---
I already know the reward isn't really that good at these lower levels. I rather someone else enjoy them
---
Didn’t someone test and rule this out?
---
Right? I was gonna say how much anxiety that gives me just looking at it.
---
This pleases me
---
Thank you!
---
I make sure I have food and water.  I lifetap to even health and mana and then Eat and Drink.  I hate warlocks that lifetap to 20% health and 95% mana and then wait on the healer.
---
Also I prefer HoTs to direct heals for lifetaps.  I try not to lifetap to low health and force the healer to pay attention to me.  Just toss me an occasional HoT and i'll make the most of it, I promise.
---
Cookies stirring rod (stirring rod?) is fire

True same as streamer who said would not stream classic. The clout is to strong for these people

Played in 2016 for a day or two with a friend, but never touched it again. The amount of good feedback got me subbed. 
---
Level 10 shaman orc finally after so much reading and learning... Grouped up naturally with people just doing the same as me and it is nice. The social aspect of Classic definitely there. I plan on playing for quite some time, I just would like to find a nice guild community I can begin to get to know.

You can do AH scans that only scan the last page (newly listed items) and buy the stuff nearly instantly.
---
You should be drain souling a lot because you should be creating and consuming healthstones off cooldown to keep your health pool up and keep tapping. And mass dotting is fine if your in afflic, mass dotting siphon life just means more damage and more taps
---
Stop watching him? I dont watch things that I don't enjoy. Sounds like you should avoid watching him then 0 vibe killing
---
I have have less to say about Asmon and entirely more to say about his fanbase who supports and encourages this behavior. Like, stop.
---
People really go to reddit for relationship advice lmao no wonder it’s in shambles
---
Same they mana tap to like 5% hp, you’re drinking and its like really couldnt you just drink mana now you want me to waste mana on healing you to a 100 nah, you can take this renew.
---
hope that everything you want drops prior to lvl29. no exp lock like retail has. in classic there was no exp gain from world PvP
---
Too much of the first one will certainly land you on the second one, makes perfect sense
---
But that's irrelevant, it hasn't been playable in years (within ToS) so it might as well be like a new experience and for the people who did play it immense nostalgia for those days would also drive people to play it, it's only logical its massive right now cuz everyone is either playing to remember/haven't gotten to in awhile/its their first time or they want to play it as their main game and if we go with every MMO ever most are the former. I'd never claim classic will die I'm not stupid but just like retail once it's not the talk of the town its playerbase will decrease quite a bit.
---
Why does he live rent-free in your heads then?
---
but that doesnt change the fact that its a Make Azeroth Great Again hat which you can buy as Merch from Esfand
---
Which one is best? shows also prices of full stacks?
---
Lmao i appreciated that
---
It's actually really nice that this subreddit has been constructive about not liking retail. I see interesting comparisons as we all try to figure out why a game with simpler rotations, more tedious quests, and no flashy cinematics ***feels*** so much better than a AAA 2019 product. I don't see much flat-out vitriol toward anyone.
---
And it's great as a hunter with a pet that eats fish. Free food!
---
Dmed
---
Honestly, it takes no mats for them, just mana iirc. Tip what you want, they aren't really hurting if you don't tip though.
---
Chill boy, do what you wanna do some people cut themselves for fun.
---
Welcome to the experience that is, trowing a rejuv on a warlock on 95% hp with 20% mana and him not lifetapping
---
whew yeah, my queue spot was like 3000 then the EST T. was &lt; 1 minute then BOOM 300 minutes
---
Im not watching him but 300k other people are.
---
Isn’t it also what mudkip is based off of?
---
Shhhuuuuttt uuuuuuupppp
---
If DM east or west takes your group 2 hours at 60 you need a new group.
---
Nothing has ever been officially confirmed, but they said it will be 3-4 months per phase. So BGs "should" be here sometime in December.
---
Warlock should never lifetap so that they have more mana than health.  Good rule of thumb is keep your health and mana even.  If I lifetap down to 50hps, it is because I am also completely OOM and we are about to wipe / barely win a fight.
---
&gt;getting a new ra
---
wands do higher dmg then shadow bolt at that level tho
---
Its always been available hasn't it, why wouldnt it now?
---
You NEVER got killed in wpvp?
---
This is so sad, i cant believe grown men and women are fighting over what someone and his fans choose to do in a virtual video game.
---
I'll keep it in mind thanks a lot! :)
---
Heh, I enjoy the craziness of pugs. Though, I main druid so I can shift between rolls on the fly. It feels good to get shit teams through dungeons, and teach people.
---
It's funny it's almost like artificially separating the community so that you can reverse back to something purely out of nostalgia and hate on the other people playing the previous version would have negative effects all around
---
Starcraft would be cool... 3 factions
---
Lmao he doesn’t that’s why I said he’s not the face....the classic wow subreddit is....I don’t watch him nor do I care what he does....I’m just saying for most people this reddit is the face and my him
---
I've got about 11g at level 28, not sure if I'm ahead or behind the curve.
---
He really isn't the face of classic. Blizzard doesn't associate with him, the community barely associates with him and his own fan base fucks with him constantly because it's fun.
---
The man is bfa epitomized. Stop calling him the face of classic just because he's the top WoW streamer.
---
The weapon speed does not really matter that much other then, for faster two-handed weapons you want to use seal of righteousness. For slower ones you go with seal of command. Just go for the highest DPS value you can get. 
---
Personally I like the slowest weapons the best. Gives you more oomph!
---
Quite the constructive addition to the discussion my boy, well done!
---
the way you said 1230 am and 345 am, reminds me of star trek for some reason.
---
did you set weather effects to 3 or something ?
---
Vanilla doesn't have a collectable tab like retail. Everything has to be earned by each individual character.
---
Some like to stab 'others' in the back even though there is no honor in it.
---
\*shifty eyes\*
---
Where is this, so I know where not to go?
---
Yes we get it. People buff each other. You may be a bit late to the free karma train!
---
That guy is just a moron, checked his comment history. Jesus.
---
Combat swords is by far the best option to level but that doesn’t mean you have to do it. Level what’s fun to you.
---
I have it running right now without issues.
---
drain life costs more mana then you can back from it with lifetap
---
First to 60 didn't even use this strat at all either.
---
Is there a player notes addon to track all the shitty flakes who leave groups after their loot drops or didn't drop?
---
You are absolutely pathetic if he bothers you.
---
I don't really care how he plays the game. It's his choice if he wants to spam Scarlett monestary or skip quests to get ahead. 
---
But his begging for loot and piggybacking off his fans is straight up pathetic. On top if that, he criticised BFA for its terrible reward system, but it's perfectly fine to take free shit his fans are giving him?
---
handle locks with reju/renew, no heavy healing needed unless they drae aggro. Theyll manage with hots.
---
My role as the healer is to heal the tank, actually. If I see that there's enough spare mana to heal the dps, I will, but I'm not going to beat myself up because they get carried away and fuck things up for themselves.
---
As long as me and the tank are alive then I can res the others.
---
As a DPS your job is to to as much damage as possible WITHOUT EVER DRAWING AGGRO. If you pull mobs you did it wrong and next time you should wait longer for the tank to generate threat and try not to spam your moves quite as quickly.
---
w/e all healers need to do is give a hot
---
Does anyone have an addon that will show crafting costs in the tradeskill window that is not tradeskillmaster?
---
The dad might be back now classics out. Maybe he was just waiting for the right time.
---
Wat
---
Ya look at those 6 upvotes. Look at bois here we come!!
---
Correct - at low levels no one has destro talents that help shadowbolt.  No one has +damage gear which shadowbolt benefits greatly from.  It is frustrating but at low levels you toss a DoT if the mobs last long enough and wand.
---
this is the actual Battle for Top Comment
---
why are people obsessed with this guy?  I watch his stream sometimes and I admire how quick he is mentally at discussing topics but other than that.. don't go too far into the rabbit hole he's just some dude playing wow. Ignore him and get on with your life
---
That’s blatantly false. They can put up decent numbers with the crowd pummeler, and they are certainly the best of all the healing classes, but they are in no way a top DPS if your other members are competent. Nor should you expect a player to be burning MCP’s while gearing through dungeons anyways.
---
I love the Druid and I’ve played one for years, but their damage is not really a practical spec, even if it is workable.
---
I am a bear druid.  The ring dropped in Deadmines with agility and intelligence.  I didn't roll, even though I could definitely use it.  I knew the mage or priest needed it more.  If I can make this rationale, why can't hunters or anyone else (who rolls need on things they don't need).
---
Even as a healer I do find tanks slow AF
---
So its Cats like you that make me wait in the queue for an hour before I'm able to log in...
---
looting a mob that isn't dead yet?
---
I never really have a problem with it as feral, because there isn't a huge demand for strength and agi leather armour. Sometimes competing with rogues, but not that often. Same for weapons, a wep with weak attack or slow dps but huge STR attributes is huge for me, but useless to everyone else who actually needs the weapon attack to be decent.
---
Well yeah, it’s not hard. But it’s bad considered how slow you kill mobs. If i team up with a friend, we complete quests (even drop quests) much faster, due to priests having spirit tap (mana) and therefore being able to heal, and the dps class being able to kill much faster. So there’s a very nice synergy. With, as you said, next to non downtime.
---
Go hemo.
---
Dirty deeds, hemorrhage and initial make downing single target mobs a breeze, plus you can pick pocket run with functional stealth, prep, and vanish cd's
---
Guess it doesn't help i'm new to the sub reddit
---
Wtf happens when PW:F crits?
---
I love doing this 😆
---
Wow this aged well
---
Exactly this, I life tap knowing I can get my health up back easily, I don't expect the healer to waste his mana on me when I can just heal myself anyway.
---
That's wrong. You can fish 1-300 in the starting zones.
---
No it has not always been available.
---
You obviously find first aid worth while. What do you get at the upper levels that herbalism does give you? If I might ask as a wow noob
---
You are looking at this image on a 1080p screen right?
---
I usually only carry a stack of each, since I dont need it out in the world.  Good warlocks can balance everything really well though, dont feel its necessary to overheal them.  For example, if my mana is 50% and my life is 100%, I am going to tap so that my health regen can continue with my mana regen.  So that's why whenever healers put me to full, I spam tap.  Otherwise I'm carefully balancing everything.
---
Just keep in mind that full healing a warlock is less effective, our demon armor grants life regen on top of the passive regen from spirit, so if we are wasting regen by sitting at full hp we are wasting mana regen too.
---
PvE nerds get triggered so easily
---
In dungeons, I usually tell the healer to not worry too much about healing me unless I fall below 75% health. I try to only lifetap from almost full hp so that I don’t waste the healer’s mana or distract from healing the tank, unless it’s a situation where I need to use a lot of spells so that we survive the pull. It’s super important to regen both health and mana at the same time as a warlock, since you’re essentially getting back twice the mana (opposed to having your health full &amp; your mana regen by itself and vice versa). I also always try to eat/drink between pulls when my health and/or mana fall below 40-50%.
---
Stuff like that always happens in every MMO ever. Just start your own groups and find other classes if you want to dungeon spam- it's not like nobody is leveling paladins or something
---
I actually completed the lost pages quest on my warrior this time around. I was quite disappointed with the rewards Tbh. I thought after spending all that time and compiling those chapters it would be like some capstone quest for the zone. Nah, just a choice of useless greens (for warrior) and a tiny bit more exp than any other quest that takes 1/10th the time
---
It doesn’t seem like you get much of anything tbh
---
Yeah, so pathetic that they dont change their title. Needing clickbait to get viewers....
---
it’s pretty normal for pro players to clear raids not long after they release. MC isn’t very hard so the guilds that have 200+ clears on him from vanilla/pservers won’t have any issue at all.
---
Free trial for a free game?
---
Can you screenshot your talents? The guide I was following said to respec at 32 but if I rush conservation and go hard on proc (currently exclusively in ret) I might find it easier to dungeon grind
---
Advantage for what?  Clearing content that is 15 years old and won’t be going anywhere?
---
No, he starts not healing
---
Can't say I expected to see Maslow's pyramid of needs on here, but well done.
---
Stfu kid
---
Not true at all. Any gear will sell if it’s decently optimized for a class and listed at a reasonable price. Might not be worth your time to make an extra 25s but people will buy maybe half of all greens that drop.
---
relatable
---
What is, WoW: Classic?

Every time i see them. But i only just started gathering

Ok. My other bags are still 6 slot + quiver

Nah you just make friends with a mage. That mage water is sooo good.
---
Do u think i should skip the Undercity quests? or are those important? i Already got my racial priest Spell (TOW).  And what about Silverpine? should i do those before Barrnes?
---
PvE realms are only half the experience.
---
Commenting to find later ;)
---
hard to say but my guess would be no
---
He sounds almost exactly like Randall from Clerks / Clerks II / the Kevin Smith movies. You can't unhear it once you do.
---
Sure, but it doesn't happen until high level dungeons. And even then i'll doubt it's often that you can't throw a simple Heal that isn't urgent (even if he uses his mana to takes aggro damages dont come instantly) on the lock.
---
They only attack with the front hooves
---
That's showing the amount that I paid for one of the blades. My group is 4 people so we have to pug the last spot in our party for dungeon runs. We always let the extra guy know that any BoE drops are full party need items and on one of the runs the extra guy won it. I messaged them pretty much immediately asking if they were willing to sell and for how much, they said 2g and TSM tracked the purchase.
---
It’s not a zero sum game. Just because they got to 60 doesn’t mean you won’t
---
Me either, not once, the mobs in vanilla reset at specific intervals, you could clear densely packed areas as long as you didn’t linger in one spot too long.
---
Kid? Lol alright internet tough guy 😂
---
Trying to adapt to BFA tanking is tough. I’m either too slow, even after I say this is my first time in a dungeon, or I start to pull without knowing a shortcut and people are like OMG WTF
---
Even then I think I'll keep my level 1 renew on the actionbar to give them. Kind of like when you give your younger sibling a controller that isn't plugged in, just so they have something to make them think they're important.
---
I ship literally every sing boe to an alt as I’m leveling my main, and in about 20 more days I will log on and list everything on the ah when people actually have some money.
---
You'll be fine. You have until phase 2 to get to 60.
---
This was perfect, editing, slow mo, music, that laugh. Genius.
---
Counter with Drain Health.
---
Get TeamViewer on your PC and your phone. Boot up wow from your phone at about 3pm. Be able to play when you get home. Or just switch servers
---
It’s a more comprising situation for the overall group to trade the healers mana for a DPS
---
Having a 60 ( or 55 a shitload of nolifer friends ) and trying to get pieces of raid gear now mean having gear you may no have gotten when the newt phase hits but the difference will probably be very small.
---
I believe he was talking about  before he was a streamer/content creator. Or atleast when he was off the radar somewhat.
---
YOU don't know what you're talkin about lol.
---
Apes streamed their leveling, they used 5 man parties upto UBRS which is a 10man, at which point they swapped to 10mans. They've done this exact thing a bunch of times before, any time a new popular server launched.
---
10 mans aren't optimized outside of SM (multiple instances sharing a lockout allowing sub-12min runs), you hit lockout due to the speed you clear, but 5 mans you can run 24/7 at the same XP rates without hitting lockout so the people who are actually good at the game use 5 mans.
---
Watch them stream any 5 man and you'll see why they don't bother using the 10 man thing, they literally can't go any faster than they currently are without hitting lockouts which lowers XP per hour because you got half the XP in a 10 man, but get the same number of lockouts.
---
Tl;dr; If you can clear a dungeon in 12 mins you're better off 5 manning than 10 manning it, and they can clear dungeons in 12 mins.
---
Only an idiot would turn down a rogue dps.
---
&gt;What's the point in making your character stronger in a game about making your character stronger
---
Is this a serious question?
---
Does McConnel get anything out of this?
---
First aid is awesome.  It provides a fast heal that can be used in combat and every class can find a use from it.  Sometimes using mana on a heal would slow you down, but a quick bandage gets you moving right away to the next mob.
---
Well its what we call the vocal minority.
---
People happy with a product rarely speak.  Those who angry often speak loudly, and even if its only 5% of the player base, oh well.
---
Companies evolve based on consumer feedback.  If you only recieve feedback from those who do not support the majority, then you end up with BfA
---
I remember "Need for disenchanting" was a thing for a while until all those people had been cast out of society.
---
Yes, at some point they will introduce paid transfers. 
---
But it's going to be too bloody late.
---
cLaSsIc WaS sO hArD...
---
I’ve been saying since it was announced a lot of people are in for a shock to see that Vanilla wasn’t hard, we were just a bit shit.
---
The biggesr thing IMO is taking advantage of the 5-second rule. As previous poster mentioned, after 5 seconds of no casting you see drastically increased regen. Top off the tank, throw your hot or shield on him, then wand to add some dps until you need to heal again. If you try to keep tanks constantly topped off you'll be out of mana constantly. I wouldnt let them drop too low, but I generally start healing them when their health is around 50%.
---
You're DPS....just look for groups looking for DPS. Played with plenty of rogues.
---
You sound like a very considerate person and I wish you luck in spreading your ideals.
---
Stuff to shoot for to advance your character when you are raid locked out.
---
Nah that's [Axolotls](https://i.imgur.com/z7FWUCu.jpg)
---
Get some water you donkey. Healers need to mana up between pulls not heal your dumb ass.
---
What do you mean?!
---
I also use Luna for party frames along with elvui for an efficient UI. Luna is nice since you get to see how much of an affect it’ll have on the players health bar.  Allows me to heal a smarter and be more mana efficient.
---
Having clique will also allow you to be a much faster caster. Instead of clicking to target then pressing the skill key, you can simply cast the skill and it’ll target and cast whoever you are hovering your mouse over. If you can bind keys from your mouse, even better!
---
Is this a good thing or a bad thing for you?  I've had a few healers say now that healing is easy/boring on certain runs, so I tap a bit more frequently for them to give them more to do.
---
Shift + left-click
---
As a warlock, it's hard to know if the healer feels like I rely on them. After a fight I usually do lifetap, then eat and drink, but the healer already throws heals on me before I can start eating and drinking.
---
That great rush when a skull ?? one shots you and then proceeds to camp you for hours. Such a rush /s
---
Thoughts and prayers
---
I've done this once way back just to see the nessie
---
Questie has a journal option.
---
So I’m very skeptical on a few things about APES
---
1. The reputation requirement to get into MC
---
2. Did they cheese any fights 
---
3. Did they use any fire resist gear
---
4. What their composition consisted of 
---
5. Is classic undertuned compared to vanilla
---
6. The game started at patch 1.12 a lot of changes were made compared to the vanilla 
---
To be fair classic WoW has been out for 15 years allowing folks on private servers to learn all of the nooks and crannies to every boss.
---
That’s my two cents
---
Is it possible yes 
---
Is it possible in classic yep Apes just did it
---
Could they have pulled this off on an original vanilla launch with the original patch without cheesing any mechanics I highly doubt it.
---
...? To get into dungeon groups while leveling, ur gonna reroll? Good luck
---
Rogue DPS is an awesome addition for a dungeon group! People are just mean, dungeon away my stealthy friend!
---
How hard does it affect the group not having a shaman / being alliance?
---
While his post was bad. Let us not act like your defense to any of this has been well thought out either. "But he  CAN use it." Is your reply to most so far.
---
2 agility vs 10 int. For a cloth item.  Simple logic.
---
Rogue needing in a bow. Obviously to a normal person the hunter would actually deserve it more then the rogue. So far your logic has just been "but they can use it!". That is all.
---
Uh I'm not really sure what you mean? I don't see either...
---
&gt; I don’t watch him nor do I care what he does
---
yet you say 
---
&gt;[I](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxptx3/asmongold_begs_for_60gold_to_get_his_mount_and/eymnpbu/?context=3) can’t stand him...he’s not even good...he uses his following to accomplish anything in game...
---
Strange
---
I know quite a bit about programming and I can tell you that it is indeed pretty impressive.
---
My world changed once i got a wand on my priest. I turned invincible
---
Depends. If you save them you'll level your tailoring faster, plus (at least on my realm) the AH is kinda finicky and it's hard to get anything sold without being undercut almost immediately. Selling them will net you some silver, but you may be hurting for mats later.
---
The rep for quests is tied to the level you complete the quest at, if you do them at max then they are all gray, which is 10%. So a 100 rep quest would give you 10 rep instead. 
---
To go from friendly to exalted you need something like 34k rep. You only get 1000 from the first turn-in quests and then it's 75 for a stack after that. So it make up the last 33k with no questing you need  440 stacks or 8800 runecloth. 
---
Of course, quests from alliance marked questgivers give 10% of the rep to all cities, so you'll naturally get some leveling regardless of what you do (assuming you do some quests). 
---
For example with Darnassus, I think 5-6k of the rep is in the first zone alone, that will go gray by the time you are level 20 or so. So if you level in Westfall and then decide you want a tiger, that's 5k rep lost you can't get back. Adds up the later you decide to start.
---
You should find a guild, I'd say. Rogues are very useful in dungeons, due to high dps and utility both.
---
There is only the "Starter Edition" accounts, which let you play to 20 for free. This is only for retail though, not classic.
---
A lot of these people have played multiple characters on private servers so levelling isnt fun anymore.
---
Just no.
---
Personally, I like to frost nova whatever mob someone's running away from if they're about to die. Prime example was a yesterday when a female night elf by Sentinel Hill almost died thanks to those pesky dust devils
---
you might want to look into a game called warcraft 3 sopecifically the expansion where you play as sylvanas leading the forsaken forces and you ally with humans to retake lordareon so the humans were indeed willing to ally with the forsaken the chances of alliances did go to crap when sylvanas and the forsaken killed of all living humans as soon as lordareaon was retaken from the scourge
---
This is true early on for sure, but I think once you have a few points into improved drained life and some shadow spell power it becomes more of a net gain. Though not much more, as life tap also benefits from shadow spell power.
---
It depends on your preferences. 
---
What do you seek to change/add to your experience?
---
Yes, some guilds are willing to do it too. There's literally no downside to allowing transfers.
---
Very true, I still prefer it and wouldn't want any mythic shit though
---
&gt; It’s not always fair, grow up kid.
---
Yeah don't question these things or call out that they are shitty practices.  Just "grow up" and deal with it like everyone else.  What a shitty attitude.
---
Technically you need to own the base game and pay the sub fee to play classic
---
You're in defensive stance which reduces your damage by 10%
---
You have to be intentional to level cooking.  Although you can pick up ingredients from mobs, fishing also helps a ton!
---
Exactly. There were always people who just wanted the best of the best and shunned all other classes/specs but there are also plenty of normal people who just want to play with you as long as you vaguely know the mechanics. The majority of the classic playerbase doesn't currently know or care what's viable and as long as their class is good enough to eventually kill Rag they are fine
---
I laughed at this damn thing harder than I should have
---
Sigh.
---
It's the small things in life.
---
The realms that currently have 12,000+ queues will remain unplayable in months to come for people who do not have remote access tools available.
---
Get used to it. I've found that I level much faster just grinding mobs. Quests can eat up a lot of valuable time just by running back and forth all over the place.
---
For instance I am currently getting about 150xp per mob I kill. If I kill ten mobs that is 1500xp which is about what I would get from turning in a quest. If I just stay in the spot and grind over and over it feels like I am leveling much faster. 
---
That being said there are definitely still quests that are worth doing but just be aware some quests are worth skipping.
---
Take all of this with a grain of salt as I am just telling my experience so far.
---
Its not the point of keeping you log for hours. Its to estimate the time you will get in to fit with your gaming schedule. If you get like 30 min on 1h early. Its not a big deal
---
I think people misunderstand when someone says "raiding in vanilla was much harder." They mean that it was harder when it was current because everyone was super bad back then, there were extremely limited resources for learning the game. Only a tiny fraction of players actually cleared all the vanilla raids. But obviously when returning to it with the way gaming communities are now, it's a cake walk.
---
The biggest irony is that the hooks are there because they're afraid it's not fun anymore
---
That’s not how it works... there are no level 30s trying to kill you in level 15 questing zones.
---
Herbs and mining nodes too. I’ll be killing this mob to get the herb and someone just swoops in and stares at me while looting it.
---
thunderclap is stupid for treat generatingt.  
---
use intimidating shout.
---
Thanks buddy. Follow up question - if MH attacks faster, how come the poison on my main hand applies significantly faster?
---
So basically it is all about being patient. So sadly this doesn't help my progression for the time being but it will have to do I guess! Also I am leveling a warrior so it is just two times difficult haha
---
Indeed, cant confirm anything on the goblin being there during Vanilla, but i do think this should be a feature.
---
Kinda unfair to people with the regular collectors ediditon or whatever.
---
mage OP
---
Druids only have battle res at this point, yes.
---
Me (priest) and my friend(warrior) from retail always use a 2-hander, he complained alot about how he cant hold aggro, so I asked what if he used his 2 hander for more damage, it helps him with threat so we go with that ever dungoen
---
Isn't there no hate threads on this sub? rule 2 and rule 3. Just because someone is a streamer doesn't mean you can break the rules to rant and talk bad about them. Actually stupid.
---
you can eat me
---
Only person I totally agree with in this thread.
---
Depends on the warlock
---
What server are you on because that might have been my guildies
---
I cant wait for the retail vacationers to leave. I dont mind dungeons taking an hour or even 2. The gear upgrades are very much worth it in Classic.
---
Some of this stuff wont be replaced for a while, unlike retail. Also, as always, if you pull it you Tank it. That's been my motto for 15 years.
---
Depends.
---
While leveling wands can be your best dps for many levels, and you don't benefit from life tapping then.
---
Also, life tapping takes a gcd so it's always best done when ooc or when running etc, as it lowers your dps.
---
Demon armor also is a small health regen. Dont think it'd even regen the cost of a single lifetap over a fight.
---
the innocence in this post.
---
I rather fill my tank in 30s whenever I need.
---
I can find gas even on apocalypse. And living in rural area in Brazil having an electric car would just make my life worse for nothing.
---
Nah. Sounds cool though, waking up to your car filled up. But imagine running out of "gas" in the middle of nowhere between huge lands of farms.
---
Hahahah omg dude this came out of nowhere for me...im dying.
---
Damn, Hurricane Dorian looks scary.
---
&gt;He is using the same tools and system that I helped create
---
I dont want to sound rude, but I'm really naive about computer stuff, but isnt the system a little bit old? Because for me sounds like "Hi, my windows is rebooting everytime. - Ok sir, what version is your windows? - It is 95"
---
For real, the only people who have gone aggro on me so far in classic without any warning have been NE druids. And I don't know why, because I'm a rogue and *will* win that fight if we're of equivalent level. Some dude was grinding the same area as me and I was just minding my own business, and he tried to jump me several times. 3-0, me.
---
ya thats mainly what im concerned about. My main goal is to get farm up devilsaur leather before the majority of people can get it themselves
---
There's a multiboxer on my server leveling 10 mages and when he leaves instances, etc he pops 10 X arcane explosion instantly and oneshots everyone outside.
---
Him landing at a FP is going to be fucking insane.
---
I agree with you, but I will say, and you said it yourself: it’s only been a week. It’s still entirely possible the effect of the rose tinted glasses will wear off.
---
That said, I’m still having a great time leveling with friends both in Classic and retail.
---
You have lots of mana regen things like evocate and mana gem. I don't see spirit benefiting my husband much at 30. I'd say stam.
---
As a resto druid, give me all the spirit pls ♥
---
“Enough” is a vague word so...does that mean I watched it a lot or seen 1-3 min of a couple videos and turned them off because he’s a twat?.....I’m sure you have formulated an opinion on of someone who you only experienced 5-10 min of interaction.  I’m not sure why(probably an asmongold dick rider) you’re so persistent on trying to make this true, but either way I’m don’t talking about this with you...believe what you will my guy!
---
How does one even respond to such ignorance and stupidity? 
---
/Facepalm
---
Yes there is, once people get bored, realms that are queued up now might become low population. Blizzard didn't have a good estimate of initial demand, so you can safely assume they have no idea how many people will stay long term.
---
Queues are a short term problem, realm population is a forever issue. Server transfers are a like using a bandage trying to patch up a severed limb. They're waiting to see how it dies down before acting, which at this point is probably the best call after they botched the launch so hard.
---
I seen this person running through Wetlands on my 24 Hunter. I attacked her close to death and then we sat for a few moments. A troll hunter came running up right behind too. Shared emotes together and off they went.
---
Not sure what is an excuse. Just explaining why VC was the common way to do it on beta and launch servers in NA. It then shifted more over to DM over time. Especially on EU servers. And now old players are coming back and the two standards are being used.
---
[deleted]
---
I just add them to my ignore list with a note saying what they did
---
Stitches isn’t a “wandering monster”, he’s a Gift, as clearly explained.
---
What logic are you using to assume that suddenly half of a realms population will simply quit / disappear?
---
Except if he isnt spending the gold. Much better to save mats which gain value than save gold during inflation.
---
Aw shucks haha
---
Ah, I see. Lots of people may not have add-ons. I always use an add-on that sorts by buy price  
---
Best of luck with getting tons of gold!
---
Do you think they will add fishing tournament to classic? Is it already in there?
---
i am lvl 23 ish and i still have grey/white bracers
---
&gt; You pretentious asswipes have to find something to REE about don't you? 
---
225 fishing is respect! Keep it going!
---
I’m not your pal, friend. I described how you are acting unsympathetic and the reasons behind it. While you just throw out a very overused and childish phrase. Although it did serve to enforce my point of how you are acting selfishly. I’m not even sure why you would play a social mmo with that attitude.
---
Imagine waiting 15 years for a Blizzard-run Class WOW then posting on reddit complaining about how other people play the game.

Brief About Us: We are a Semi-Hardcore PvX guild, however we are heavily based around PvP and Sieges. Our community has been around for more than 12 years, spanning from ArcheAge, Black Desert Online, World of Warcraft, Gloria Victis, Mount and Blade, and more. We are an 18+ guild looking for passionate, war-driven, unique individuals looking to expand and conquer in this upcoming game.
---
Member Base: Our community has over 200+ members.
---
Current Activity: We currently play Guild Wars 2, Planetside 2, Conquerors Blade and waiting for several upcoming games. We have an expansive community usually willing to play about anything with others.

---
Twist: the one yelling "I AM PULLING" is a hunter.
---
Unpopular opinion here but I enjoyed the fuck out of Legion as a fury warrior
---
Just enjoy the game, i made alts when people were doing aq40. Make it a sport to dodge those guys and gank them when they are low
---
If you killed a single mob while in a raid? 10 mobs? 100 mobs?
---
You plan to draw some arbitrary line
---
Im not sure if it is in classic, or if it starta in BC, but higher gear has an MP5 stat (mana regen). Otherwise, if I recall spirit ia for regen, and im guessing some is better than none?
---
What? Nothing I said was toxic.

you must have done really bad in school if you think 2 paragraphs is long

---
I'm completely new to wow all together so maybe I'm missing something but people on this sub and on the server discord channels seem so far removed from the game it's crazy. 
---
People seem to think that if you arent the first few to get to 60 you somehow arent playing the same game? It's so weird. The majority of players, especially on the big servers, haven't even got to play much with the queues being so long and real life being a thing. 
---
It's important to realize that this view of the game that reddit has is not the majority of the game and most players are still below level 15. The game just released a week ago, all content will be relevant for a very long time, everyone will be leveling at different paces so there will always be people to enjoy each stage of the game with.
---
nothing related to playing wow is free, you pay about 12 eur a month or something like that. after 6 months it's like you bought a new game.
---
Which tree? I was just noticing how the rain *doesn't* go through trees in Darnassus. I thought it was funny because they figured that out in 2004 but Skyrim in 2011 hadn't.
---
Depends how you are playing. If you are aoe graining you want Stam and Int. 
---
If you are questing you want as much spirit as you can get.
---
/join lfg  use trade chat for trading
---
What did he say if I may ask?
---
stamina so worth it
---
WC was one of my favorite Dungeons. It's essentially the first "long" dungeon you get in. Made a lot of friends and guild members through there.
---
You are assuming 90% of people playing now aren't just tourists who want to check it out, it hasn't barely  been a week yet
---
Dude come on:...
---
True true, though my OCD as a healer is having everyone full :P and sometimes in a hectic fight I'm not sure if they are taking damage or tapping. I usually just slap a renew on them though
---
In my first deadmines run I did it with 3 friends and a random hunter. The four of us did not get much loot, be we got some memories!
---
Needed on ALL leather, regardless if he needed it
---
Needed on both 1h and 2h axes, said I like to collect axes, I axeman.
---
Barely spoke english
---
He was the perfect hunter-loot stereotype!
---
If WoW had a system like FFXIV, with separate queues based on brackets, that would be amazing.
---
I honestly don't know why timewalking is an event, instead of a thing we can just do whenever we want. Permanent timewalking would even be better than FFXIV's roulette system, because we wouldn't have to play through the dungeons with half our abilities unlocked.
---
I have addons, honestly many, and don’t even have that.
---
Ah got it! Thanks for the clarification!
---
I mean the int is good for my arcane shot!
---
Can you even read the chat/quest texts on the top monitor from that chair?
---
Just curious, not meant as judgement or anything. Do you not feel this way about retail? I can sort of see how it’s different because in retail you have way more levels to cover. But does that negate the experience somehow?
---
This makes me feel uncomfortable
---
Was faster for me with 30% cat form speed, ye. Would have sucked without
---
Tom? I think we were friends on Myspace.
---
I wish I could find more rogues for my groups. Great utility and great DPS. Rogue mage lock is a great DPS combo for endgame dungeons.
---
GZ, im there right now waiting.
---
Maybe with premade
---
This, plus alt-'1-4'. 
---
I don't need more than 22 hotkeys in combat.
---
I only recently released that the Thunder Bluff lifts have no cabling or any support whatsoever. They literally just fly up and down.
---
But weapon skills! :^P
---
Why are you here
---
It's actually not. Higher int = faster learning weapon skills
---
Shluchk
---
I also noticed there is zero chest etiquette in Classic. While I'm pretty sure there was in vanilla. I've had it happen three times today that I party up with someone at a quest spot and they just take any chest they see. We encounter a chest. I say 'roll' and I roll, and they just proceed and loot it.
---
Doesn't change the fact that 5 man's are faster lol.
---
“With constantly loaded environments and player models, my guess is a lot!”-paraphrasing but yeah just no.
---
Renew is what I usually use unless they are like below half health
---
No worries, good luck! :)
---
&gt; “Enough” is a vague word so...does that mean I watched it a lot or seen 1-3 min of a couple videos and turned them off because he’s a twat?
---
I mean I'd hope not? You can't really form a valid opinion in 1 minute. 
---
&gt;I’m sure you have formulated an opinion on of someone who you only experienced 5-10 min of interaction.
---
Sure but I wouldn't go around insulting them on the internet based off that. I'm sure you've had moments where people would consider you a shitty person if they only saw you at that second.
---
&gt; I’m not sure why(probably an asmongold dick rider) you’re so persistent on trying to make this true, but either way I’m don’t talking about this with you...believe what you will my guy!
---
I don't really like him myself, so it isn't that one. And persistent? It isn't exactly a struggle to write out 3 reddit comments.
---
Nice! I’m running same the cape and chest. Currently wielding a 2H with +5 Agi (I think) but really want to run dual swords. I’m jelly! What lvl are you at??
---
&gt;When does it become more efficient to ride your 60% mount to your next objective versus using Ghost Wolf?
---
If you plan to ride for 14 seconds or longer upon finishing your 3 second mount cast time.
---
Therefore, if your next point of travel is 17 seconds or less away you should use Ghost Wolf to get there instead.
---
Ah yeah it's just phrased strangely to me. 14 seconds of riding or 17 seconds away including time to mount. Either way until you're riding longer than 20 seconds the difference is under 1 second.
---
You can still raid dungeons. It's just less xp. And I'll still happily dungeon grind when I need a break from questing because 5 man groups have been faster anyways.
---
So unless you get recognized everywhere by everyone you aren't a celebrity?
---
Looking at his comment history I'd say it's justified.
---
GatherLite.
---
What are you talking about. The instance is called Dire Maul. Obviously I know there are different wings.

Might be an expert blacksmith. You need to find a journeyman trainer.

**&lt;Primordial&gt;** [Eng] Hardcore PVE/WPVP - Tue/Thu/Sun 6:30-9:30 PM PST 
---
Primordial is a progression raiding and world PVP guild. The core team team is a bunch of WoW vets who have been playing this game for too damn long. We've run successful raiding guilds throughout every expansion. Most of us are in our 30s. Our goal as a guild is to clear all the raid content as it unlocks and murder KT, all while killing alliance in the world and in BGs.
---
**Who are we looking for?**
---
We're looking for mature raiders who want to kick ass while being social and having fun. We're usually sharing stories over coms and having drinks while we play.
---
Need a couple hunters, warlocks and healing priests. Backups also welcome!
---
**Raiding Schedule**
---
**Tuesdays, Thursdays, Sundays 6:30 PM PST - 9:30 PM PST**
---
This is our planned raiding schedule. It's subject to a little wiggle room depending on majority of players schedules. Ideally we clear by the end of Thursday, but we've got Sunday for clean up or other activities.
---
**Loot Policy**
---
Our aim with the raiding loot policy is to always be fair, and to improve the overall raid and guild. By using loot council, we will ensure that given gear has the largest impact the on the success of raid and guild. The loot council bases the decisions on factors like: individual contribution, largest upgrade, role priority and attendance.
---
Loot council is a tried and true loot policy that works best for progression raiding guilds, as we've successfully used it before in cutting edge content.

I’ve heard mythic raids are really challenging. If all I care about is raiding what would make retail not a good option
---
"Slow down. Life is to be savored"
---
Their skill level is disgustingly high it’s not even worth attempting what they do.
---
DM is deadmines. DME is Dire Maul East, DMW is Dire Maul West, and DMN/DMT is Dire Maul North/Tribute.
---
You must be level 5 and must not have 2 primary professions already.
---
The primary professions are: enchanting,tailoring,blacksmithing,,leatherworking,alchemy, herbalism, skinning,mining
---
Earth mother magic.
---
No queue at all?
---
Oh no the people that only like pvp and raiding will have to stick to only pvp and raiding the game is surely ruined
---
If you pull one off, just stand in front of the tank spamming drain life til he notices
---
I wish you weren't a lil bitch
---
And sometimes they desync so they just go up and down at the same time
---
What bothers me is not that they are doing it, but the fact there are people actually watching that shit. What the hell ???
---
Disagree.  The leveling experience is great.  What pushes this direction is the rewards despite it being only somewhat fun.  It's faster and more rewarding so people do it...
---
You should update about downranking.  I’m not sure how it plays from 0-59, but at 60 downranking is essential.
---
What's popular is literally the definition of meta. Most people had no idea it was a bug.
---
I've only had 2 chests stolen, both by the same guy over 2 days. I called him out the second time and he just spammed me with "OMEGALUL", "KAPPA", ":THINKING:" and /clap /confused, etc.
---
Realized he wasn't a dick, just mentally handicapped.
---
Flat out wrong. Remember when I asked for proof? Not just words.
---
I meant like this https://classic.wowhead.com/item=865/leaden-mace
---
Here's one of the only greens that's damage is on par with cruel barb before level 30, good affix and it's an upgrade, find more than 1 example like this and you win.
---
Here's an example of a weapon that with good affixes comes close but IS STILL BARELY BETTER THAN CRUEL BARB https://classicdb.ch/?item=15213 and its lvl 31.
---
My experience, which really doesn't matter since there is data to prove my points, is a lvl 60 rogue on nostalrius. I played a warlock on elysium.
---
Thank you to everyone for your responses.  What I’m gathering from those of you who gave educated responses is that we are experiencing “spell batching” which delays the time between when you hit with and attack or spell and when the health of your target gets decreased.  This seems like something there really isn’t a necessity to keep, but I do understand the slippery slope mentality.

Oh wow

Id pay 45S for this on my hunter for sure.

Go away

Barrens chat is cancer and nothing on its former self, just memes.

Hell I'm on a RP server and barrens chat is like goldshire on a mormon server.

Aside from that it's been perfect :)
---
I accidentally deleted a 10 slot bag. The restore item self serve feature link doesn’t do anything. Has this been addressed? Am I doing something wrong ? (Besides deleting bags)
---
As a hunter with no rings who also likes having mana, that ring is a juicy upgrade and I'm rolling need on it.
---
Play Druids, love Druids, but they aren’t the best healers. Not by far. Pallys take the cake there and even priests are better
---
What level are you? 
---
Vanilla is a whole not just raids.
---
The dps listing is for physical ttacks, weigh the stats against eachother to see whats best as a caster.
---
Had his happen to me today. It's hard enough keeping people up and not going oom. Don't need you life tapping every fkin pull and chain pulling.
---
I only have one major profession right now and I’m talking to the starter trainers
---
I’ve played PvP realms all my years of WoW’s existence. Rolled a PvE realm for WoW Classic because group of friends wanted to. Fucking boring as shit, here’s to hoping Blizzard offers transfers or something.
---
This used to be a legit leveling guide for paladins in vanilla,
---
1. Start auto attacking
---
2. Turn some porn on
---
How do I open this window?
---
A Hunter pulled some adds yesterday. He fucked up, caused a wipe and was the only one to survive (still a wipe because we had to corpserun).
---
No hard feelings but it's hard to not roll your eyes and go "of course it was the hunter" when stuff like this happens. That stigma is ingrained in my DNA by now. 
---
(if anyone is wondering - 'gnomeregan jumping down somewhere pet takes the scenic route' accident)
---
Tailoring will help you in both crafting items for yourself AND a steady cash flow in selling those items and bags.
---
This happened to me yesterday in STV. I was running rampage on my priest and killed a few people a couple times each. word must have gotten around because they grouped up and basically hunted me down and forced me out of the zone. Had to leave and quest in Arathi for a bit.
---
Thank you for this. I would have never pieced that together yet I enjoyed the lore.
---
This. Rerolling simply isn't an answer for many people and it's frustrating that it seems to be the go-to response.
---
you heal them Oo
---
Is that usually the rule of thumb for selling materials?
---
Great, thanks!
---
True but... at some point you just gotta take some losses. I mean what fraction of people actually exploited this, and what fraction of that did so to such a degree that the balance of things is completely thrown off? Probably not many, especially when you take into account that the vast vast majority of players are just casual people who don't care a ton about being the highest level guy in the server or anything. It'll even out in a couple weeks and the effect will be negligible.
---
idk but i got nugenergy installed but cant open settings. /nen or /nenunlock is not doing anything
---
You can always make your character auto run against a wall. That won't disconnect you as far as I know
---
Yes, he wipes out many vendors and quest givers.
---
People talk trash on Paladin levelling but at least those guys get to heal after they auto attack something to death.
---
You mean RFD?  I would assume BRD would give a lot more gold.
---
What are your professions?
---
So they don't get called carebears by their fans.
---
Counselling would be good ... but I still need to figure out if it‘s worth it, or if my wow days are just behind me.
---
If if he was on cam how do you know it wasn't prerecorded?
---
Yesterday was normal..still havent played today
---
Not saying it wasn't, just that he did post it.
---
what makes you think that? 15 years ago players were trash and I feel like this time around once guilds start hitting 60 they’ll blow through it with all the knowledge they now have. I mean the boss mechanics are really simple compared to the raids I used to run. It just doesn’t seem worth the huge grind to 60.
---
I’m in the starting areas of Undercity and Thunder Bluff, I can talk to the trainer but no luck with options to train
---
Us healers appreciate the down to earth locks that know this. I had a lock today who gave 0 fks. :(
---
If only one piece was on Pornhub I'd have loads of material
---
Emberstone Staff is much better, intellect is better than spirit for warlocks and extra stamina is always good. DPS doesn't matter because you're not hitting things with your staff very often.
---
Class identity is back bois
---
Any plans to turn this in to an addon?
---
Today a person stood next to me watching me die to a mob.
---
Wait what. How the heck can you do a 10 man dungeon??? I thought the limit was 5 for instances and 10 - 40 for raids. Wtf
---
Yes it does....as soon as the TBC servers pop up.
---
Fantastic arguement
---
The answer here is don't take "DPS" Warriors.  He's a Warrior, he should tank till 60.  As a Warrior willing to tank, I'm not going to split drops with someone who can't be bothered.
---
Isnt thatbwe kill demons and undead so have even more attacks?
---
**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] Nethergarde Keep | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one character.
---
* Likely one 40 man per week, most likely Monday, around 19-23 CET. (Plus optional 20 mans when they come out.)
---
* Loot council.
---
* A few more Warriors are especially welcome.
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
No information yet.
---
To be brutally honest I'm not sure I'd want to see free or paid transfers between all realms. Offers to specific  full realms to join lower pop realms perhaps but my memory of opening transferring during BC era involved the utter collapse of every major raiding guild on my server (Kel-Thuz). The better players used it as a chance to flip to more aggressive guilds elsewhere.
---
My memory is pretty good because it's recent (pservers). I think it's worst than juste mages screwing up pulls, there's a whole competitive mentality of people outright refusing to group up or letting the tank pull packs one by one and it's frequent to a point where I have difficulties finding a normal group. Like I said in another comment:
---
I didn't join grind groups, that would be stupid from my part of complaining after willingfully joining them, wouldn't it? I'm not talking about premade hardcore grind groups that have their all shit figured out and I'm not talking about someone doing a simple mistake either. The problem is the random player that gets in invited in any "standard" 5-man dungeon groups, for some of them (tanks, mages, w/e) the only way of clearing these dungeons is by aoeing even tho the rest of the group wants to pull a single pack and target skull, so they do just that and start body pulling too many, or start aoeing packs the tank didn't pull and make everybody wipe. Upon discussion they just blame everybody saying "classic is easy just aoe lul" and that they know better than me because "they clear MM 70+" or whatever then linking the dps as "proof". It is ruining the group's experience weither you agree or not. I've had a couple of group disband because of this and now i'm approaching SM level and i'm dreading what I'll find there.
---
Streamers can do whatever as far as know, I blame some of their viewers for imitating them without thinking, refusing to communicate and ruining my classic experience.
---
It seems like blizzard just don't care about..more than a week passed and they didn't do anything
---
Read my comment again chief
---
No shit only Faerlina is full, just wait until people on the Americas servers start to wake up, theyre all gonna fill up real fast.
---
This is a remake of the original version of the game before any expansions came out.  A lot of people feel that each expansion added something new that wasn't exactly improved, adding up to a lesser game by now that we've had like 7 expansions.  So to cater to these fans, Blizzard released the original version
---
Did you ticket a GM? In chat agreements are actually binding.
---
Just go to another server if your dying to play. It’s the only solution atm
---
Lots of new players, when you get higher (or at least if you're high now therefor playing with mostly vets) then ninja'ing in groups becomes rare as hell and EVERYONE call them out.
---
In the open world there's some ettiquite, but a lot of people will still just watch you pull the camp with the chest in it and immeditately go over and open it then run off and those people you simply ignore with a note explaining why you won't be playing with them @60.
---
No but someone of a few levels up tries and fails
---
Well, I don't know what to tell you my dude, you remember wrong. Feign Death should make your pet run to you and turn off combat. It's entirely possible for the ability to fail on raid bosses because it got resisted in which case it will come and smack you or for you to die in boss aggro range and you feign death only for the pet to be attacked by the boss after it reset again.
---
https://youtu.be/eIW0i5tch1E is how it should function, but it doesn't. You can see the pet attack players, the hunter using Feign Death and the pet running back to him while putting him out of combat to drop a trap. Yeah, that doesn't happen in current classic. If your pet attacks it keeps both of you in combat through feign death
---
I'm not even sure the horde can read considering they live in straw huts.
---
Then don't roll on a PvP server. Next.
---
It is affecting your game. People get to higher level faster, which means certain items get into the economy faster. Profession head-start, cornering markets etc. You can put your head in the sand all you want this does have an effect.
---
That's definitely the main difference for me personally. Retail feels very linear, with only choice being to raid or pvp. I realize there are more things to do, but farming mounts, pets or going for achievments never held any value to me.
---
Demand. We started with an equal amount, the pvp servers kept filling to the brim and the pve servers did not.
---
You must suffer for the light.
---
This and as a customer i should be able to play wherever I want
---
The joke went over his head because he’s a dwarf. But it was nice if you to give an honest explanation.
---
Yep... buff 3, drink, buff 2 more, drink, then ready to go.
---
The answer is yes, I am an idiot. Thank you!
---
So basically you're saying Asmongold failed the wow community by being the same Asmongold that made him the number 1 wow streamer of all time? Fascinating. I am so surprised at this turn of events. \*grabs popcorn\*
---
&gt; escort quest
---
Interesting, never played alliance and probably still won't, but is there a video on YT? Been searching with diff. keywords and cannot seem to nail anything down...
---
Trying to level priest without at least grabbing spirit tap is such an awful experience. The first 5 ranks into shadow give 100% spirit boost on a mob kill, the first 5 into holy give 5% heal crit. Nobody is going to notice a difference.
---
Or if you go disc you get 25% wand damage, which also won't help heals
---
Classic isn't free. You need a monthly sub to use it
---
But why capitalize personally...?
---
I'm not saying it's not broken. I'm saying you're over the top about the potential bug making the game literally unplayable for you. It might be bugged, but it's not stopping thousands of hunters from leveling or playing the game. Just work around it until it's fixed, and if you 'literally' can't play with this 'bug', then uninstall and cancel your sub instead of wasting money on a 'literally unplayable' game.
---
RFC confirmed alliance dungeon.
---
They are two entirely different routes with different levels, drops, balancing and quests.
---
why didn't they update the graphics to the current standard? was it asked by the community?
---
NR gear for AQ, FR/SR gear for Naxx
---
Its not as balanced as you think, but thing change over time.  Warlocks for example are not great at DPSing in early raids but become beasts when AQ/Naxx come out.
---
Nah these mfers are 0for6 ya gameplay so I just dodge em
---
its not getting resisted, we have combat log for that its just bugged and not working
---
From what I've seen it isn't about useless specs. We aren't talking "no rets" (ret is totally fine dps at low levels by the way),, but it seems like entire classes are ignored for being suboptimal. Thats a problem.
---
If you won't slow down to enjoy the journey, you're going to be disappointed in both WoW and life.  
---
Goals are fine.  Sprinting toward them with reckless abandon and cutting every corner is not healthy.
---
Depends what kind of challenge you're looking for.
---
Classic was not made to be a competitive game and it's difficulty doesn't reside in mechanics.
---
I wish your mom swallowed
---
What more help do you need here?  Seems fairly straightforward.  Pay $15, play WoW Classic.
---
I’ve never played wow before and I’m having an absolute blast!
---
I find them so shit for anything. My university has keyboards like them, so I try to avoid going to labs whenever I can just so I don't have to use them. They cut my typing speed in half I swear.

"The book can also be.. a hat." Peter Griffin.
---
This might actually be the dumbest comment ive read in a while.
---
No, OP isn’t stating that streamers shouldn’t be getting loot because they’re streamers. OP is stating how weird it is that streamers haves talked so much good about vanilla and how great the adventure to 60 was, and now that we finally have classic they “cheat” their way to 60. 
---
It’s like being hyped for a movie and tell everyone how good it is gonna be and then you only watch the trailer. Can’t you see how yikes it is?
---
That’s literally the point I’ve trying to get across this entire post but people just keep shitting on me for calling the end game content easy. I was okay with the challenge of getting to the end game until I realized after that there’s really no challenge left. And I’m just not a player who finds most of their fun in leveling and questing and that’s just my personal play style.
---
Supply and Demand. Some materials go for "craft" value which usually is higher than "vendor" value.
---
Yes. You do it by opening the skill pane (press k). Then click the profession. In the bottom section where it describes the skill, click the red button to unlearn the skill.
---
I think I am the one relaxing here by trying to have smooth run, you have people telling me they straight up stop healing a member of the group rofl.
---
But i can trade my healthstone/ss for my thanks
---
I'm ignoring cooking because I can make it appear out of thin air like a fucking god.
---
People do it because it’s definitely the most efficient way to level. There’s no denying that. Still, I totally agree - and whenever I have daggers I try to use them. I’ve always played a combat/sub hybrid, and I too love playing with stealth. It gets boring using sinister strike into evis.
---
Thanks, I will look into further into that.
---
I wonder if Hunters are actually still the top noob class or if the stigma just causes confirmation bias.
---
I any case I very much enjoy seeing noob Hunters. Just like back in the day, even if it's likely way less prevalent nowadays.
---
Gotta love that reused fake laugh

Since when is Classic 20 years old? Also, did you read the article you linked to?
---
&gt; By 2002, USB flash drives had USB 2.0 connectivity, which has 480 Mbit/s as the transfer rate upper bound; after accounting for the protocol overhead that translates to a 35 MB/s effective throughput.
---
Ran DM as a lock last night and I made it a point to life tap like once. Maybe twice per normal pull. And I often followed it up with a life drain. so the healer wouldn't need to heal me. And that was usually enough that natural Regen would cover the rest between pulls. Bosses I could usually burn 80% of my mana, tap twice and then finish the kill.
---
All in all it was a good run, tank held most aggro so the healer only healed me a couple times total.
---
Not a very noticeable difference, but I guess if you’re trying get a few more dps in a 5man do you. Pets really don’t do much in the grand scheme of things, not that the 5% would change anyway
---
I don’t expect healers to heal me back to full. I usually eat food after tapping or bandage. I’m spec’ed into improved tap so the conversion is 1 health to 1.2 mana so it’s more efficient to do this.
---
If anything, just cast a renew and not a full heal
---
If you're playing on that server you get whatever queue time you deserve.
---
And I'm assuming it isn't on that by default? And if not, what IS the default in case I would like to turn it back to that?
---
Wow requires a sub, it's nothing new.
---
Lol no it doesn't
---
I’ll try it without SUF, for the moment it just displays every mobs health as 100
---
No they're not a big deal. Play what you want
---
Estimated time is just that, an estimate.  If ten players enter the game at once, the queue time will change.  If only one person enters the game after that, the estimated time would go up again.
---
So how about you play the game and move on if it isn't for you.
---
To level professions the effective way you can look into Guides f.e. at classic.wowhead.
---
Leveling outside the levelrange (grey/red quests) is inefficient because quests below your level give less EP, while red quests usually take far too much time/effort than alternative quests. Anyways: Quests that are far above your level can  not be accepted (even though some quests are available 10 levels early - these are impossible/extremely high effort and never worth it.
---
You'll get a feeling for how much things are worth (f.e. now on 30 I don't care about 7 copper anymore).  General rule of thumb: Try to make smart routes so you can sell every now and then. Always sell (and repair) when next to a vendor. Try to keep the most valuable items to sell and crafting materials you'll need sooner or later. F.e. Mining ores and gems for engineering and cloth for tailoring and first aid.
---
Can confirm Noggenfogger has some fucked up chat moments going on. Its entertaining as hell
---
Being at the top is lonely
---
Had this conversation with a priest in one of my dungeon groups. As an affliction lock I have points in both improved life tap and improved drain life. As far as core kit goes I demon skin and health stones as well as health pots. Health is a resource and I sit low because it's more efficient to regen to full during fights because i have means to heal to full instantly.
---
As to what you should do between pulls for me? I'm honestly expecting nothing because I'm planning to heal up after dotting up mobs in the next pull. Although I will say that a hots is always appreciated, even if I end up just using it as an innervate down the line. 
---
Ps I'm also picky about what I have in my inv because I have one bag slot dedicated to soul shards.
---
No. Fucking..... way..................
---
They are? I had no idea.
---
What were humans originally?
---
Possibly just used it as an excuse. Might have just been the only thing he was after in the dungeon. He should have really been looking for sword and board if he’s a tank.
---
I still haven't used my 110 boost from BfA lol.
---
I think there's a big difference between looking for ways to optimize your character and demanding other people you play with do the same thing.
---
Damn right.  Best part of the mornings off work!
---
Is leveling as prot warrior and pally doable? Always liked them more as prot than as ret and arms
---
I’m still having fun at 29. The paladin quest you’ll get at 20 is a real adventure, be sure to do it for a great weapon, hopefully you’re on a PvP server for that. I’d also recommend duskwood as a levelling zone so you get to use exorcism, I’m gonna be looking for more zones with lots of undead/ demon types in to level up more.
---
Get auctionator - lots of items have similar or greater values to DE when compared to vendor prices.
---
What's with the fishing outfit, Randy? Is that nightcrawlers I smell? What about our no bait agreement?
---
Focus on leveling.  Buy bags when you can afford it.  At 8, you can go to a major city and get bags from the auction house for around 2s each.
---
You should try to stay in leveling zones as long as possible.  At your level, a lot of gray armor and weapons are only worth a few copper.  Keep stackable items.  Delete the least valuable thing in your bag if you find something better.  Go to town when you have quests to turn in or your bags are full, or you have a bunch of mats for your profession and you want to level the skill.
---
There was some heavy rain in silver pine forest yesterday and even though there was no fog, it was quite hard to see things.
---
At some point I pulled a mobs and I didn’t see the 2 others that were nearby. Needless to say I died
---
 Well said. Also, these phases of content being added to classic will give us a lot of game time. Then, if they announce TBC and allow us to move our vanilla toons over to TBC, that's even better. 
---
I'm probably in a minority that would play TBC exclusively if they released it. But as you said, people won't play wow forever. That just won't happen. There will come an end. 
---
But yeah, they either have to add content to clsssic to keep it fresh when the phases have all been rolled out, improve retail as well.
---
I could go as far as a few quality of life changes. Its a slippery slope, but I wouldnt mind things like being able to interact with vendors in druid shapeshifted forms :)
---
Still good as a 5 man
---
I never said we ran 10 mans

Imagine being this salty at life, that you have to write angry comments on cat pictures  😂

Since this is basically and Addon thread now I'll ask here if anyone know of an addon that changes the class color for shaman to blue in basically the entire game, like different chat addons or the blizzard raidframes. My mind just screams paladin.

Also looking for a profession window expander. Basically https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24980-QuestLogEx.html this treatment for the profession window.

it's actually hilarious that you typed that shit while serious btw. nice one
---
Because I chose the first Est PvP server I saw on the list on launch day, and my first play session got to lvl 14 and didn't feel like starting over again; I deserve a long queue time? 
---
If they offered even payed character transfers I would gladly pay 20$ to transfer my 34 druid to a less populated server.... However I'm not going to start a new toon because of the server rediculousness
---
https://youtu.be/4JkIs37a2JE

Well I'm no Sherlock Holmes, but I'd think that interaction with a live chat stream would be a little bit difficult through a pre recorded video.

Is Blizzard doing anything about the queue times? There hasn't been any improvement since day 1..
---
Yes sub req.
---
There are world first already down and I'm level 16 lol.

that's been there since day 1 the first time round I'm afraid.

Keep exploring though there's lots to find if you don't know about them all.

Does Luna have mobhealth/debuff/castbar working on its own or do I still need those addons with it?

MH doesn't attack faster, you're just using abilities that cause the MH to automatically attack, sinister strike was the example. I would suggest using a combat addon to show the timing of your MH/OH swings to see exactly how things are happening, but your MH is dealing damage more often because most of your abilities as a rogue work off of your mainhand specifically. Your offhand in almost every case is basic attacks and poison application.
---
Obviously you’re not the best warlock haha.
---
What is the addon that gives you all the additional information?
---
Not when you have giant neon red names.
---
I have no issues with my voidwalker agro as long as I don’t go ham on the mob before my pet gets to it. I send my pet I’ll dot the mob and just wand. I don’t pull agro until the mob is maybe 25% but at the point it poses no threat and it usually dies in the next two or three wand hits.
---
  I've only player a bit of pserver before classic, something like 4 hours or so. Didn't liked it that much. But WoW classic? I'm having a blast! I love to throw buffs here and there to other players, and it's awesome to form a party to complete quests.
---
I hate dying and having to walk to my body, tho'...but i can deal with it.
---
I've only had to wait in queue on the first day.  Playing on a baby realm I guess.
---
This works for both parties...people who complain about Trump forget their political choice was a woman who called black people “super predators” and pushed for anti-black laws....

Its not all colorful rainbows on the democratic side either. Thats why I sit pretty without labels.

Stay away from earth shock. Lots of threat.
---
That feeling when you're spamming the hotkey you think is set to "Fear" (because things are so dire that you're willing to risk aggroing a bunch of mobs just to try and escape), but it turns out the hotkey is actually set to "Life Tap".
---
Make checking in. Stop to drink after every pull. NBD.
---
Just stealth and layer away.
---
GG Blizzard....
---
I got feral druid which is a shame because I know I'd 100% roll one if they weren't so gimpy in end game dps
---
Yea instead of drinking, I life tap about half health and use bandages
---
Especially (and emphatically) rocks that have become The Rock.

id like to pitch in here and say i can confirm it IS 60 minutes.
---
Down, nvm...

---
People are saying it was, I didn't personally. But I also didn't know it was a bug. Honestly I do expect someone involved with wow classic development to have seen someone doing it at some point the past week. Devs are in big streams all the time.
---
grats! :D this is a grind i def wanna do at some point ... wish me luck
---
Acorn was my friend
---
I haven’t played retail since MoP , can someone explain what’s with all the hate toward it?
---
Using hellfire to kill yourself is a good way to save repair costs when your raid is about to wipe. If you die from hellfire, you do not take durability damage.
---
I moved to a low pop server and like the day after launch it became a high pop server.
---
What is layering?
---
Opening with Ambush + Gouge + Backstab + Evis and most targets are dead, Cheap Shot + Backstab + Kidney Shot + Backstab + Evis and most targets are dead too, but I agree with less downtime and survivability. Also, with sub talents you can get behind targets way easier than with other builds.
---
You really had to be a dick about it, didn't you?
---
Welcome to the fold
---
They tried making them offtanks but only they know when they quit on that idea.
---
Shamans were "jack of all trades, master of none". Blizzard themselves described them as such in that little book you got when you bought vanilla and all classes had their description etc.
---
Looking at Druids, Shamans and Paladins I think they were all intended as some sort of hybrid but it would probably be a nightmare to balance and those classes would dominate the whole game if they could do all things equaly good.
---
As far as classic goes, someone had to do it. Not sure it was this guy, bit it was definitely somebody.
---
I definitely wouldn't sell anything rare now. No one has the money that it's truly worth
---
The quoted bits are from the account in the submission, which isn't the OP. He wasn't permabanned for anything he wrote in his comments. In fact people by and large *aren't* getting permanent bans for inciting. Where they get permabans is when they respond to the ban message calling us cunts.
---
We have no obligation to deal with shitty people in modmail and will just up the ban immediately if people want to be shitty. It's the exact same way in r/classicwow and basically every subreddit in existence.
---
As a tank, it seems like it's always a hunter.  I pause for like 10 seconds as the healer gets Mana, and off runs his pet to go tank some mobs.  "Can we pick up the pace please?"
---
Damn dude, you aren't running out of Mana or taking damage because I am, and I depend entirely on the healer.
---
Also, every hunter I run with seems to think they should not attack my target, and I always have to run and taunt the add off them.  Like... Why spread the dps on multiple targets when we could take this one down?
---
True, still a dick move when a guy is obviously working his way towards a chest and then some dick runs up and grabs it as soon as the last pull is made to clear the space.

---
Should I be running a stave or mace/axe with shield. Also should I kinda be a tank buddy heal him if the healer needs a helping hand.
---
I'd ask if that was me, but I went to bed early with our 8 week old 🤣
---
Risky click of the day
---
So you can be a healer aswell levelling as enhancement, if youd rather do that. As a dps, use rockbiter but not earth shock. Earth shock draws mucch aggro. Let the tank hit the mob a couple of times before starting to hit it yourself if you feel that you are taking aggro a lot. With a good tank it wont be a problem though.
---
We’ve got a lot of people from retail with retail only mindset atm.
---
Once old classic players start to feel out new friends and become accustomed to their characters, this will hopefully change. 
---
I hope so at least.  World pvp was the best thing about wow.
---
If you're rolling in clear upgrades for other people in pug groups so that you can min/max and power level you're literally the reason everyone hates hunters.

As an Night Elf rogue I am channeling my future anger for future horde burning my tree. I am not any friendlier than Undead rogues.

Its the hunters and rogues who feign/vanish super early when it might not be a full on wipe if they had kept doing damage.
---
Those people have no commitment and they suck.

SO when did this happen? I've beeen looking through patch notes and haven't seen anything?   Is it just the +wep dmg that helps and I mis-remembered?

I take my built up stv anger and let it out when I run through hillsbrad. Sorry not sorry

Classic is supposed to be a faithful recreation of classic as it was in 2006. And in 2006 there were scarce resources like devilasur leather that people needed for impactful profession recipes. It's not faithful to the original game to have people spamming world chat to constantly phase to new layers so they can have a gold/mat farm 4x stronger than was originally intended

Int doesn’t provide spell power scaling though. So it’s no better for arcane shot than it is for any other ability that costs mana on hunter

I've been playing in the morning. There doesnt seem to be any queue times. I even managed to get into whitemane instantly so I could delete my toon on there. Seems like after 5pm things get crazy and servers start to fill up.

eh now that i recall Ragnarosh was easy on farm for every guild by 1.12 as well.Guess for ppl that farm it on regular at private server its nothing ,don't even need time to get gear.Wondering will bosses later be any challenge....if not perhaps Blizzard could give them simple buff in increase  hp and/or damage
---
^ This. We have Drain Health and Healthstones, plus the tank between us and the mobs. We're not squishy.
---
Albeit, healers also don't have the time to discriminate between us and every other class mid-battle, either. We're just the cause of their "OH SHI--" moments, as soon as they see our health bar dropping rapidly.

No spirit is fine for leveling, it helps a lot with your regen. I like spirit too. The crafted gloves I mentioned are +6agi, +3sta, +6spi.
---
That has no effect on you. Focus on yourself and enjoying the game :)

I leveled it just fine (over 5+ levels per character level) in durotar (1-60ish)/barrens(60ish-100ish)/stonetalon and a little in silverpine/ashenvale/hillsbrad. I am now at 180ish at level 28. You have to go out of your way to nab every herb you see and occasionally scout out lesser traveled parts of the zone.

Cooking can and probably should be leveled while you level, just by killing stuff you pick up tons of reagents. I'm level 45 with 275 cooking and I've only had to really go out of my way once and that was for the 225 cooking quest.

I remember finding an epic one hand hammer.... something of the northwind on my warrior and I think I used it for 13 levels back in the old days. I forgot how rare it was to find good equipment. Retail you are replacing your whole set in 2 hours
---
I'm doing it with shaman and it's quite hard to pull off but does still work, definetly beats face tanking with a slow  2h
---
Oooh man, Friday I was pretty tilted in Westfall. The camp of Defias right next to Sentinel Hill had a chest next to the mobs, so I slowly worked my way through to it. Mind you It's pretty late, so not many people were around. I killed 4 or so before finally getting to chest, but they kept spawning on top of me! One after another, I go for the unlock and BAM another one. There was a literal pile of corpses. I had expended all my mana, some potions, my engi bombs, LoH, Bubble it was insane. As I begin to open open the chest one last Defias spawns on top of me... and then, another Paladin casually walks by, takes the chest, and hops off into the distance... betrayed by a brother of the light... needless to say I have a bit of a grudge.
---
Or ya know the simple solution of just giving them something that you may not need and they would. Done this multiple times with chests and no one really cares.
---
Mind sharing a bit on how to maintain aggro on multiple enemies before getting chain lightning? Attack each once and earth shock to generate more threat?
---
I’m not dissing classic at all, I love the game (even though my favourite version is TBC :D) and it’s definitely engaging but I’m just not seeing why people say it’s so crazy hard
---
Douchebag says wut?

When trying to look for groups for BFD and SFK is it better to look in the trade chat for or acrually near the instance?

One night I was laying in bed using Google remote desktop to check Auctioneer and I noticed my character kept jumping. I disconnected GRD a couple times thinking it was a phone error, then got up to find my car basically doing this.

When I was younger, like 14 - 15 yo, I used to play in the dark, and when I was hearing my father/mother coming to my room, I was closing the screen and went to bed pretending that I was asleep....once, my father laughed at me and told me "Do you think that I don't know what are you doing?" and I laughed while I was pretending to sleep x)
---
Can they see why you have them on ignore?
---
I guess I made this post because I wanted confirmation that the raids on retail really are challenging and complex.
---
I had a mans named JFish of guild “Relentless” (of which I was part of at the time) scam me 18 wool. We agreed in chat he would make me 2 wool bags. I went to him and traded, and him and buddies started roasting me when I asked about the status of the bags (probably 30 mins later)
---
Pretty scummy!
---
You're very much welcome. Melkree &lt;3

Glad to share.my wisdom

Verigan's Fist is a power house of a weapon. Did Worgen in the Woods at level 29/30 and it just turns those worgen into rugs.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Brokentooth is a rare cat that you can find in badlands, it is the cat with the fastest attack speed in the game.
---
Haven't had problems tanking in dungeons. Sure I can't hold threat on every mob but it's normal. If dps pops off they can tank for a bit it's cool.
---
Is there a mage equivalent?
---
what you want to do is start making macro's
---
type /macro in game and it will open a menu, click new and set a name for the macro (something that makes sense to you), you can choose an icon, but you dont need to because the macro code will put the spell icon you want when you do it right
---
using the macro you can combine two spells onto one keybind with shift like you want
---
say you want frostbolt as X and polymorph as SHIFT+X, make a macro that has the following:
---
\#showtooltip [mod:shift] Polymorph; Frostbolt
---
/cast [mod:shift] Polymorph; Frostbolt
---
this is saying show the icon for polymorph when im holding shift, otherwise show the icon for frostbolt, put the macro into a keybinding slot (your X keybind for example) and when you press x it will be frostbolt, shift+x will be polymorph, you can move it to any keybind slot and also re-bind the slots and add "bottom left" "bottom right" action bars from the interface options and also bind to those slots thru the keybind menu
---
Thanks, glad you like it :)
---
I just type out deadmines so there's no cause for argument.
---
They also chase u across the entire area if u try to run for ur life! No joke I had one of the voidwalkers chase me from the main building all the way past the main silverpine road
---
Yeah I think they're just there for world building.
---
Alot of things like that in the game it's honestly great. Like the things you see on flightpaths you can't get to just being put there for players to look at.
---
Play whatever you feel like playing. Hunters are fine
---
Only because it became that way, which is the other guy's point. Vanilla and TBC saw very few people get to the 'end' raids - what do you think the other 10 million people were doing? They were actually playing the game. Economy, trades, dungeons, questing, gearing, leveling... all of those were better than they are now.
---
Retail has stripped out the rest of the game in favor of the endgame. Consequently, the endgame is super fleshed out, but holy shit is the game boring.
---
Does the general player base enjoy and appreciate mythic raids? I’ve heard mixed things about them.
---
When are BGs and honor system coming out?
---
I mean it's useful, but who cares? If you don't want it don't play it. If you do want it, play it.
---
I dunno what you want from me here. You'll be "sub-optimal" if you don't choose it, but you're "sub-optimal" in real life if you don't go into petroleum engineering or whatever, and I bet you didn't, so who cares?
---
I RP a lot with people too, and many of them catch on. It's really fun lol.
---
I’m the same way. The only real way is to get ahead of everyone else. I’m around 240 Tailoring and 230 Enchanting. You just need to sell things other people can’t, or your forced to just undercut everything.  
---
Otherwise, just take it slow and focus on the gear you can make that you can use, like Shadoweave, as a goal.
---
You think THATS bad, you should see our measuring system.
---
Same boat as you.  I am thinking about getting an iMac.  Only game I play is WoW and I only play WoW at home    I have an iPad Pro for all my mobile needs and since I got that I had not touched my Macbook until WoW classic came out.
---
They've got an in-house addon for this. I'm not sure if they plan to release it though.
---
The damn remote... "mom, wheres the remote?!" Me: idk, where did you put it last? "IIIIIII DDDDOOOOONNNNNTTTTT KKNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW" (said at top of lungs while remote is stuck to their forehead!)

---
How do you hit 30 in 24 hours without aoe grinding? Christ I have 2 days played at 30, and I had 3 60s in vanilla WoW. I could legitimately get probably 6 120s up using dungeons/xp potions/timewalking by the time I get 1 60 up.
---
You can drag a mob near them and it will probably put them into combat, though. For whatever reason mob proximity seems to initiate combat in Classic, even if the mob is already being fought by someone else and you didn't do anything to the mob or that player.
---
I never remember vanilla (or any version of retail wow) being this way and would love if someone would post any video evidence that it was. Would love to be wrong but I feel they messed this one up.
---
I was really good with my priest too so I guess part of the motivation is to see if I've still got it lol
---
Ask me again in 5 years. For now I want Classic to be exactly as it is.
---
No, this is not true. Hunters won't top PvE groups or run battlegrounds, but they are by no means weak.
---
Thanks! I knew about pets. I just never played Classic before, so I didin't know how people did get their abilities in 2004 :D.
---
Am I right with that: to get Claw lvl 3 (for example), I have to kill pet who has Claw lvl 3? I saw people were talkinga about this in chat...
---
I get that dungeon finder started the whole antiocialness of retail but I think they at least need a global chat channel per dungeon that you can only see if it's in your level range so you don't have to wait in that zone to find a group.
---
The only dungeon I remember having more than 5 was ubrs.

Hunters are pissed atm. FD+FT is an absolute key ability in PvP. And it needs fixing.

Yesterday my poly was breaking off all the time, then I checked its debuffs - Viper Sting :)

Totally agree you should play the game the way you want to, I swear if I hear another neckbeard tell me I’m not doing it right if I don’t play on a pvp server I’m gonna do something serious that I can’t think of right now.

There was a poll I saw somewhere and  overwhelmingly people who had not played wow said they would rather experience the leveling.
---
My og vanilla name was Drallen so when I made a char on a private server I went with that name again. I went afk in the gadgetzan inn and when I came back there was an ally druid next to me named Drallan. Weirdest shit ever
---
Prime example. straight up objective question and it gets downvoted. Wtf?? Sorry for asking

If they take a week off to decompress and play other games, I don’t think it’s too far-fetched to toy around with an alt. They can do whatever they want off-stream and they don’t have to prove anything to us.

I then specifically ask you in general chat if you're advertising for VC, just to cause the argument.

Humans originated from Vrykul (The Viking-like humanoids in Utgarde Keep in Northrend) which were the result of the Iron Vrykul being affected by the curse of flesh. 
---
Another interesting fact is that Trolls are the oldest race on Azeroth, and Night Elves descended from them.
---
Race and class?  He must be put on a list.
---
had the same experience. I play mage, but don't want to do these aoe farm groups. I went with some of them as I wanted to do the SM dungeon quests. 3 out of 4 groups were super toxic.But here is a hack: Build your own group and tag it with "normal run". Takes a bit longer to find players, but you will find cool people and have a fun run.
---
Hey would love to link you my build :) I’ll probably change it when I get to lvl 60 just to emphasize sub a little more but I’ll get back to you soon.  
---
And I think it’s considered hard because a) rogue is the second worst leveling class in the game, b) it’s hard to face tank as sub up to the late 20s, and c) it just is pretty slow in general. I agree that it’s not super hard, but also I’m level 20 and have already died at least 50 times.
---
Soul link warlock would sure be a pain in the ass to deal with in wpvp
---
Cdew is also pretty great. Current arena pro, hasn’t touched it since Classic came out. He’s quested basically the whole way to 44ish now, doing a dungeon once here and there if he had a quest.
---
Even refused to take gold from other players for his mount and it took him until 43 to buy his. Fun to watch while you quest because he’s just as hyped as you to be questing in vanilla.
---
I leveled in Vanilla to I think 45 as a subtlety dagger rogue and switched to combat. It’s the multi-mobs and the sustain. I love daggers though

You can’t say it’s a fact then preface it with “it could have” lmfao.  Do you see my point?  All I’m saying is your speculations aren’t facts.
---
i believe the barrens alliance elites drop an item that starts a quest you can turn in. the loch modan horde elites do not, just drop a green or two.
---
Haven't seen this discussed 10000 times a day on here?
---
no one class is superior to all others, many have advantages but it would be extremely unbalanced if one class could own every other class.
---
PvP is 95% player skill.

The prize is also low competition on early farming

That's not worth banning. What the fuck?
---
today, while taking a piss, a fly landed on my nose where I had a scratch. I kinda felt that said fly ruined my whole pissing-experience yet it dampened the itch on my nose ergo my pissing-focus shifted to pondering on why my nose was itching in the first place vis'a'vis OHMYGODASMONGOLDTOOKGOLDFROMWIEVERSWTFISWRONGWITHTHISWORLDGODHAVEMERCY
---
Difficult in another way. Leveling is much harder, obtaining gear is harder, getting gold is much harder. You need to get attuned to certain raids before you can even do them. You need to grind reputation to get items end game. Everything takes more time to do. Boss fights are not harder on classic. They are straight forward for the most part.
---
So you are like level 12 and people who are much better than you kill ragnaros and that kills the game for you? Pillow soft
---
Not sure what your argument is? Like I said, everyone only cares about being efficient, not having fun, even at 60. It's not a phenomenon that only occurs before 60.
---
Lol wtf. So apparently it's the job millions of random players to keep his crusty ass satisfied??? I really don't like him... He's always such an annoying prick
---
You can change your graphic settings to current standard, the default is vanilla graphics. If you’re talking about stuff like the new character models etc it was very much asked by the community to keep the old models.
---
Exactly, you might think that all these tedious mechanics like feeding pets or needing ammo or soul shards just create chores or extra stuff to manage, but they can also create meaningful interactions between players like this one.  If you just QoL everything away you end up not needing to rely on other people ever and it detracts from the overall experience.
---
You poor bastard. They should have had a warning for that server: Streamers, toxicity, and queues ahead.
---
Above the waterfall in elwynn forest. It's basically between Elwynn, Stormwind, and uhhhhh... Was it burning steppes? I think so.
---
Literally why I asked haha; I have time to play in about 3 hours and am now in the 3 hour ish queue lol. 
---
I personally hope for another increase in allowed server population at one time. But I would also be quite happy if they implemented server transfers
---
Yes, without Asmongold, McConnel wouldn't be able to stream full time.
---
It's the principal... the person that found it first is clearly trying to kill the guards around the chest. It's bm.
---
Sure thing. This is just my opinion, but I think doing gathering professions 1-300 at lv 60 is kind of boring, and I enjoy doing them as I level. Herbing so far has been more enjoyable to level than mining has been in the past, so I'm happy with the choice.
---
Imagine if layers didn't exist half the playerbase wouldn't be playing.
---
Good band, candlemass.
---
I dont get why greens from chests dont initiate a roll when you are in a group , it makes no sense
---
Too bad. If needed, create a bridge or something.

Flying and catch up mechanics ruined it for me.

I was taking a screenshot of the female Blood Elf (for research purposes of course) and as I did, this Taurens big ass head popped into the shot.
---
you are a failure to yourself

I'd honestly stay with that character there and roll a new one. Then you can RP as the crazy mountain hobo who yells at passing players.
---
What about weapon skills, including unarmed :p
---
My guess it's WeatherDensity 1
---
He’s not a boss. Horde summon him to attack an alliance town. The boss would be patchwerk.
---
Funny because retail actually requires a lot of time just to keep up with new content, while classic won't have that problem, so unless you're going for a high pvp rank or hardcore raiding you're not required to play just to keep up with the game. So I think your friends just prefer the instant gratification you get from retail, or don't enjoy mmorpgs anymore maybe.
---
And why exactly did you ban him?
---
Keeping an up to date wand is certainly worth it, the armor, not really so much.
---
I'll meet you IRL. How close to the Applebee's do you live?
---
Where can I go to get that Sucaba on tap tho?
---
Yes, and very. But the world feels like a world, and it makes all the difference.
---
Not only that, the higher levels lets them have access to higher end gear/gathering so now they control the auction house.
---
In 15 years of playing off an on i've not leveled fishing once, and i plan on doing that and cooking together to get the full experience. No rush on leveling here.
---
Figured it out, can't download it without first paying for your subscription.  Lol
---
Hunters are annoying to deal with until you figure out about their deadspot where they can’t melee or shoot you.
---
if you're constantly having more stacks of herbs in your bags than a single bag has slots then it's absolutely worth it. An example is for me, I create soulshards to create healthstones and soulstones or to summon my demons. I have two 14 slot bags and two 12 slot bags. I can get a 20 slot souls bag that only holds soul shards but the most shards I have on hand at any given time is usually 4-6. If I swapped out for the souls bag I would have 14-16 empty slots at all times that I can't put loot in. It's better for me to keep my normal bags and just dedicate a section of one bag to my soul shards.
---
Why the fuck do people watch this guy? lol.
---
Seriously, the only time I've seen him he's complaining about something, which more often than not involves "how much other people complain".
---
Meanwhile, everyone around me seems to be having a fine and dandy time playing the game casually lmao.
---
I seriously think this is what happens when you let a game dominate your life and your mind for so long.
---
It's going to keep increasing as more people learn to use remote access tools.
---
If you think the queues will solve itself you're in for a treat.
---
Wrath. I remember leveling tailoring on my deathknight because of how funny a giant Tauren in plate looked on a carpet.
---
Some low level drops are really good. You're not going to be selling a level 12 mace for multiple gold but you can definitely make a decent amount of silver with the right BoE.
---
What does it mean when it shows your characters name under the item description?(Kharzka)
---
How? So far ive did that to one person who tried to ninja every tiem in a dungeon, but i had to put them on ignore and then add them as a friend for the note. is there an addon that lets you put notes on ignored people?
---
I came here to whine about my unfortunate realization that just because I got in easy this noon that sadly doesn't mean the queues are gone.
---
Not sure why you think you have any authority to shut me up about this. I can vent frustration here as much and as often as I like and if you have a problem with this you can just kindly fuck off and enrich a thread that is more suited to your taste, mate.
---
Slappers is an amazing pet name.
---
He is correct in everything he said.
---
Badass.
---
If all you have to do is enter an instance as a raid group and farm, then it's not really an exploit.
---
You're perfectly allowed to farm instances in 10 man groups, the game lets you do that. The XP is their mistake, their bug. No one has to do anything out of normal codeflows to activate it.
---
Now if players could not enter instances in groups of more than 5 and figured out a way to do so that would be an exploit worthy of punishment.
---
Depends where you are I guess, but on launch day literally every server had queues. I got lucky and avoided it on Kromcrush when they opened the server, but I've still had some short queues on that server this weekend. Unless you play on an RP server or something I'm not sure how you could possibly have avoided queues entirely.
---
Hows your FPS? Not a big deal but I find its strange that my FPS wont go over \~100ish (9700k/2070Super).

DoT, Fear, Drain life. Classic lock for the win

No.  It's not.  It really isn't...  I love my cats and all, but I don't trust them around my WoW characters.  A few years ago I was leveling a character and stepped out to get the mail.  It was a short walk to the mailboxes and a short walk back.  That's all the time it took.  One of them got up on the desk and walked my PC over to the middle of an area filled with elite mobs, who proceeded to murderize me.  I have no idea how they got so far into the area, because I basically had to do a corpse-hop back to safety.
---
My cats aren't allowed near my keyboard when playing WoW after that.
---
Yes a wow addicted hobo who can buy everything you've ever owned on one year's salary LOL. People hate him because he is a pretty normal nerd who is living out every other nerd's fantasy of playing games all day, having a hot ass gf, and making more money than he knows what to do with.
---
&gt; Let people play the way they want, why would it bother anyone else?
---
That would be fine if it wasn't actively disrupting a big part of gameplay. I'm a priest and I couldn't form a group for regular 5-man runs of SM. People wouldn't invite certain classes cause it wasn't the meta for the run.
---
Considering how many people have that opinion then I consider it to hold some truth. I’m not having fun leveling. Before I made this post I was under the impression all the end game content was comparable to rag. Apparently nax and aq40 aren’t. But those are two raids. And that’s a hell of a lot of grinding for two raids. And after getting to level 15 I realized how much grinding it would actually take.
---
shots fired
---
Only a few Americans called it VC. It was never the commonly accepted term in the community in general.
---
Because in order for play to be fun, there has to be *some* level of mental activity going on in your head. Otherwise you start to get bored, doze off, think about other things. 
---
Modern MMO world content is so easy that it's brainless. Classic solo content isn't Dark Souls, and I'll admit I have harder hobbies, but WoW classic is at least not brainless for casual players. It's really easy…  as long as you're alert and paying attention. In retail you literally play better by ignoring everything the enemies do. You couldn't engage with the game if you tried.
---
all this time we've been gender assuming the weapons!
---
This is correct, int also gives spell crit tho.
---
Well when you get wound poison it’s a poisons that will stack up to 5x on a target and appears as a debuff doing damage over time. You may not have that poison yet

If I recall, it’s based on the vendor sale price. As the other poster said anyway, you should never use that price as it’s not base on the value to other players.

Indeed, this is just my favorite. There are many options.

---
I mean, I personally despise BFA, but this is actually a great idea from Blizzard. Gives those of us who still haven't bought BFA an additional reason to get to level 60 in Classic and stay subbed for longer.
---
Not bad. Not bad at all.
---
Aww lil bitch
---
OP's entire post is yikes. Caring this much about how a person plays a video game is yikes.
---
It’s extremely simply to abuse layering and most people above level 40 or so I’ve seen do it. There is zero cooldown if you have someone invite you to their party.  
---
Kill all the mobs? New party to spawn more. Horde ganking you too much? New party. No more resources in your area? New party.  
---
There are some serious money markers going on right now and I could easily get 4x+ specific things if I was dedicated to it. To top it off, it’s easy to do.  
---
If you are in a guild where people are at the end game or beating it, you would see how convenient it is to hop into a new party and get a fresh new zone.
---
Sprinting toward your goals with reckless abandon and cutting every corner is not healthy.
---
How you do or don't consider others, how you're training yourself to think, what you're training yourself to be willing to do and sacrifice to meet a goal - all have consequences, even if it's "just a game."  
---
It's your karma.  Do as you wish.
---

You’ll be able to raid as a ret, most people aren’t tryhards. Should be fine

I would love to see the game with the original mentality and original ideas be embraced, so those who have been burning on this game on private servers for ten years can embrace it too. The game is kick ass.
---
This is so fucked up 
---
Shit lime this and the raid leveling exploit are fucking retarded. Im trying to avoid reading about this shit to avoid ruining my experience but its everywhere.
---
Wow Classic Stockholm syndrome
---
4 is Arcane Intellect, I can even imagine.
---
Nono, that was a quote from OP's post
---
you're a dissapointment
---
Depends. Are you a casual? You can get into some decent guilds as ret if you get the proper gear, consumes and show up to raids on time with world buffs.
---
If not, you'll probably only be able to join very casual guilds that don't care. 
---
The good news is that Classic is a lot easier than private servers, so there's more room for people to carry you.
---
But there's basically 0 chance to join a guild where people care about damage meters, because the longer a boss fight is the lower everybody's DPS will be.
---
Okay thanks for the help!
---
Does it really matter? Just enjoy the game and let others enjoy how they see fit. If he wasn't honest then oh well. Unless you donated to his stream I wouldn't worry about it. Streamers are just that streamers.

Didn't need to save that much time since you were going to be spamming for awhile to get a group. Further you also have DM Tribute, which is doing the no-kill tribute run in DM North.
---
Besides a couple points here, a lot of what you're saying is basically what retail is/was in the past couple years. I don't think that's the right direction to take for Classic...
---
This dudes a giant piece of shit, nothing new. 🤷‍♂️
---
I feel wiser because of it.
---
Well i did not refuse anything since i never heard about servers being this full
---
Besides its been a week now.. And still a queue of 5-7 hours.. I knew that it was going to be full but did not expect that big.. Especially not after a week. 
---
Besides i found out about this big queue days later since i was always awake early in the first 3 days so i did not have a big queue like this at all..
---
You would have to have some friends who are willing to take you as ret. Otherwise you'll be holy
---
It was always called VC because people advertised for groups in trade chat. When Dire Maul was released it was ALWAYS referred to as VC to avoid confusion.
---
How do I not get overwhelmed with quests? It seems I don't really know where I should be questing or not. Quest lines end and then pop up again in a few levels when I thought I was done with the zone.
---
Check the shaman vids from defcamp on YouTube he got all of those questions covered extensively
---
Really? Need to try this.
---
Priest
---
In vanilla people rolled for the whole chest tho
---
They've been moving goalposts since forever. Classic is gonna kill BFA, its inevitable.
---
This reminds me of those people AFKing in town to make a few silver on greens instead of vendoring them and killing more mobs. The 2-4 silver profit you MAY make is offset so terribly by the downtime from leveling and the drops you aren’t getting because you’re too busy sitting in town. Now if you were doing professions or something while spamming trade I guess that’s more efficient, but the amount of spam greens I’ve seen.. wow guys.
---
We've clearly said we're temp banning people who are intentionally inciting between the two playerbases. His comments fit that description.
---
Yeah you probably should try that Remote Desktop setup that people are talking about. Then you can enter queue 4 hrs before your intended play time from your phone app.
---
It's hard to fill 40 slots. Unless you're in a competitive guild (and I don't know what that would even look like because world first is already gone) nobody is going to care what spec you are. I play ret pala, and my guild leader has even endorsed it.
---
Its not that we care about how he plays a video game, its about the fact that he hypes this amazing classic experience up and how he talks smack about BfA and then when classic is finally released he plays it the way its not supposed to be played because of x reason.   
---
 It’s like being hyped for a movie and tell everyone how good it is gonna be and then you only watch the trailer. Can’t you see how yikes it is?
---
First off of a lot of people play on a PvE server making it 0% of the game. I'm playing on pvp and I just got to contested zones and I can't stop getting ganked
---
Ally, i was thinking of a Pally or a Druid for a good mix of heals and pvp versatility, but from what I remember the priest offered the best heals, I think?
---
Seriously. These people defending the awful leveling experience are mad.
---
Seems so fishy since all my guild is doing this and getting kicked  out of server but never banned..
---
PICS OR DIDN'T HAPPEN
---
Awesome, Thats good news! Might do Ret then, I've always enjoy Ret Pally, but heard only horror stories about Vanilla ones
---
Calm down guys my mom picked her chair specifically lol
---
Yeah let's just say these bois would have been happy... [https://i.imgur.com/PIRhdXy.png](https://i.imgur.com/PIRhdXy.png)
---
Unfortunately I've also not been able to find anything related to live queue times. If you do happen to stumble across it, please let us know! I don't think Blizzard has an official one.
---
Yes, works how i want it!
---
Well no, its full RNG. U get nothing pure skillbased. If u suck in BFA u still get great loot, if u suck in classic u just need to get better or u get shizzle.
---
Also the massive graphics improvements
---
Remind me of the back of the gauntlet 64 case
---
sorry for the awkward laugh lol
---
Nearly all of my stam + main stat items have sold on AH. I list them for 2x vendor value
---
Tbh I disagree and this seems like envy that you can't have experience he has. Hes in a unique position and would be stupid not to use it.
---
Just look at that beautiful body of water!
---
But the point is the powertrip to the point of an un-needed softban in the first place. Of course people will respond with hostility to that, and then you are handing out perms in response to your own actions.
---
Riling people up and then punishing them for acting riled up is not good leadership or moderation. 
---
I see why you guys are in panic mode over there given the current playerbase situation (and the average individual being unable to remain civil), but I think you guys should genuinely consider moving the line for a temp ban a few paces further toward the severity side of things, because right now you appear to be overreacting.
---
Upvotes and downvotes exist for a reason. The initial comment from your first post I would expect to be downvoted to oblivion where it can stay hidden. Zero reason to temp ban that comment.
---
Please tell me you're a hunter with a pet called Winston?
---
Wow. What Server is this?
---
I suspect that like me they ran out of money to train their class skills. That happened to me
---
Does Frost Nova rank 2 increase the amount of damage the target can take without breaking, or is all it does increase the damage by a negligent amount for an increased mana cost?
---
That’s just insane. I didn’t pay that much attention but for real.. 10silver instead of the 5-6 to a vendor and then moving on and getting more loot to sell.. I suck at math but I get it.
---
I piled onto a level 30 Paladin who already struggled against two other Hordes.
---
Everyone died aside from me.
---
Then I sheepishly walked past a skull-level Alliance player and fucked off back to Barrens :D
---
Livin' the Warlock life.
---
Yesterday early evening I had a 3ish hr queue, was like 8k people. I think that's the highest I've seen recently
---
No sorry that's just you twisting the definition. If you know a mechanic to be broken - and you do because instance lockouts have to be managed through the very screen that explicitly says raids give next to no XP, as well as previous #nochanges Vanilla experience - and you willingly abuse it more than the incidental time it takes to discover it; That's the pinnacle of exploiting.
---
I vendor or equip all greens until level 55 or so. I make more money faster that way.
---
Its not about the queue being higher - it's going up while she is IN the queue. She logged in, was 2900. As we sat watching it, she got bumped back to 4300+ Queue's are always going to be there, and thats survivable - if you get to keep your spot.
---
I don't think remote access tools has anything to do with this issue
---
The analogy is pretty obvious
---
That’s when you grind!!
---
Ah, I’m sorry I wasn’t clear. Thank you.
---
People without addons sell for vendor price or 50c over on the AH. I just buy anything I need, not worth selling anything atm until they learn what profit is.
---
Literally shut the fuck up lol. "people are unsubbing en masse" bitch show ME THE RECEIPTS!!! I am literally so fucking sick of all these concern trolling posts. Like we get it, you didn't enjoy classic and are mad others are enjoying it so you feel the need to spread lies and bullshit. Find a hobby, do something with your free time.
---
a vegan rogue xD
---
surely a druid would have made more sense :P
---
There needs to be some repercussions. I debated using it myself but took the high ground knowing it was soulless and not right at all. It was an exploit. Exploiters need to be dealt with. And you need to do a better job beta testing your games instead of using them as a PR streamer jerk off fest that heavily fueled this stupidity.
---
So do I on my account - on my wife's account the queue kept increasing while she was sat watching it, without leaving.
---
That’s what I’ve been doing. 20-30s for two handers early on is more than enough.
---
The chest does the combat initiation, if you open a chest just before it opens it sends out a combat ping. So If you tank mobs on chest they can't be stolen as easy
---
Damage Dealer. The more fitting term for "DPS".
---
I wouldn't use trade chat, /1 general is a better option. If you're Alliance then finding people in the zone for SFK is going to be hard because people are likely already grouped up and going there and not just randomly questing in a horde zone. My group usually asks in /1 while we're in Hillsbrad Foothills to see if anyone wants to go to SFK with us.
---
There's no need to. PvE content is trivial, as we have seen in the past few days. If you refuse to bring a feral etc then you are just being bad.
---
Boars for life man.  I think my alt hunter will still primarily use a boar.  I used that charge so much in wsg wins.
---
they all have their quirks, and many different specs.
---
Druids are annoying to fight, but run out of mana if you panic them.
---
Paladins are hard to kill, but good luck killing anything with them.
---
Locks arent as squishy as they first seem, beware CC'ing ones that look alone, and fuck fear.
---
some priests aren't as kind as advertised, they can hurt as well as they heal.
---
Good luck getting near that hunter.
---
Hitting a warrior is like punching a rock and if they get near you you are toast, luckily everyone can stay away.
---
rogue can lock you up till you die, and you don't even see it coming.
---
mages are pains with all the slow and CC, sheep trolling is not a fun experience.
---
dont let that shammy near you ever, 1 hit ko on proc.......
---
so yeah, good luck with that
---
I have a wife and 2 kids. The wife will not know that I'm playing. Instant minimize when she walks into room. Will surely take a while to hit 60...
---
This ^^^^
---
All I see is you taking a 5 point armor talent that doesn't even scale with bear form. Points better used elsewhere :p
---
It's not, you just have to activate a few brain cells as opposed to none in retail. More preparation and anticipation too.
---
The issue is that it creates logistical difficulties in putting a group together. I'm not asking people to be tryhard and only discuss game related stuff in General, but when it becomes stupid choked with arguments it makes co-ordinating with other players much more difficult.
---
it’s over
---
Or when they dart in and steal your quest objective.
---
Ah okay, thanks for mentioning.
---
/r/boneappletea
---
Don't give Activision ideas 😭
---
You play it the way you want it . In my opinion soloing Classic is horrible, make friends and do quests in group
---
&gt; intentionally inciting between the two playerbases
---
There doesn't need to be a personal attack to accomplish this.
---
Levelling isn’t too bad in terms of grinding, occasionally you’ll find yourself grinding to top up your XP, and some quest drop percentages can be pretty obnoxious so you’ll grind a bit. 
---
Professions can be pretty grindy, apart from most of the gathering ones. 
---
But hey, the grindier the better I say!
---
Same here haha
---
It's bad and most are mediocre
---
FD in vanilla never took you out of combat in the sense you're thinking. It's just like how disengage also says it takes you out of combat. You just stop attacking. FD was the ranged version of disengage - threat reduction.
---
ok, I can see and agree that it will have a short term effect on some things, but I fail to see how it is harmful to anybody.
---
And I also think that it will be a Very Short Time effect now they changed it.  I think in a week or 2  you will hardly notice the difference in economy compared to a server where this fix would have been applied from day 1
---
Yup, I picked up Questie right when I started after I remembered the Exclamation points don't default to the mini map.
---
So it's the Standford Prison Experiment of MMOs, is what you're saying?
---
Sounds promising, cheers!
---
Why would a skilled hunter let any1 get so close in wPvP. Stay max range all the time. Use slows and stings, let the pet do the work. Remember hunters more range than any other class, if played right casters cant even cast anything on you.
---
He has 6600 Uploads and only 2,5k subscribers, he has locations for almost every npc in the game, quite incredible
---
Did I say that?
---
They make the choice to donate. People make their own choices how they spend their money. As others said hes not the first world first in Vanilla. Not worth getting all spun up about it. Let people do as they please. If they want to celebrate him thats on them. Their choices of what makes them excited and how they spend their own personal money should not bother you. You dont personally know them. Its not coming from your bank account. Let is slide
---
Neat!
---
Plenty.

From my small sample size of me I've made loads of friends through WoW and know/n 5 married couples who met through wow.

Yesterday I died twice trying to clear a camp with a chest because of bs instant respawns I killed all but one mob ran back a hunter had just pulled the one mob. I took the chest, am I scummy? I spent 15 minutes trying to get the chest and he was just passing by, but he killed the final mob... needless to say he was pissed
---
My favorite part is that he doesn’t actually address the post. It sounds like he only read the title and wants to act like a victim.
---
Good on ya!  Ive been considering leveling/grinding these things, as well as the other whelps, when I get to the appropriate level.
---
While I’m sure it gets old to fans of retail, many of us who have been anticipating Classic find no enjoyment in what the retail version of Classic has become. And the constant repetition of “Wall of NO” and “you think you do, but you don’t” got really, really old.
---
While possibly counterproductive, the inevitable, reflexive “in your FACE!” response is understandable, given the circumstances.
---
Autoattacks &amp; seals are pretty much it when it comes to Paladin damage, yeah. By all means try a different class.
---
All the key binds though
---
Nothing in molten core looks like that.
---
Icicle rod from wetlands
---
You don't need to practice shit to clear all of classic... what you need to practice for is to do it quickly after launch - and that's mostly the leveling aspect. But that's the case for any game (see speedrunning), regardless of how difficult it is.
---
Try checking the common routes for herb picking. One way or another, you need to just ran around looking for herbs.
---
This. I've made sure everyone on my ignore list are people who deserve to stay there even if I can't remember what they did two months from now.
---
You get maximum enjoyment out of Paladin by playing with and supporting others.
---
Okay, okay, but how did you manage to have this minimap on top right corner? :D Is there addon working? I could not find any (I was not playing 7 years, so please forgive me if it's something common - I'm using Mapster, but it's poor).
---
Or... It is not classic? :D
---
It would fall under the not against the rules but a literal piece of shit move category.
---
Don't put points into thick hide ever. It's 5 points for nearly no armor. The bonus armor you get doesn't even scale with bear form. Waste of 5 points even for tanks.
---
No buffs for you!
---
But warriors are the original hybrid! How dare a tank class roll on dps gear.
---
yeah but they look ugly af as shadow priests
---
That's BS and you know it... Gotta stop this irrationnal hate, if you want to criticize it at least use real arguments.
---
this post is what i call autism boys.
---
As a Warrior, I agree!  Same thing happened on one of the private servers when they launched a new server.  Increased dynamic respawns and gave a group xp bonus.  So many healers and Mages just spamming LFG for a tank to run dungeons once they hit 60.
---
I don't mind bringing hybrid DPS to dungeons once I'm nice and geared, but starting out, the lack of CC is a liability to say the least.
---
Is Finn's Gambit still in game? Can't seem to find him
---
Why does it frustrate you that is targets dead mobs? It already prioritizes alive ones.
---
I don't get this. I don't mind waiting a few more seconds or eating some food. Gives me a reason to level up cooking.
---
I don't think so , at least not in the beta. maybe on live its different but i doubt it
---
Can't you do the same with grenades?
---
Amazing to see you here! I was watching the MC run with excitement
---
Isn't that exactly what you've just done in this comment?
---
Just a disclaimer because there is a lot of salt towards my post. 
---
This is just a meme to poke fun at the fact that Classic is minimalistic compared to retail. I like both for different reasons. 
---
No hate here.
---
Earthbind totem has saved my ass so many times already.
---
Yes. Travel at your own risk.
---
He's, he's wondering if he will gain as much rested XP logged in than logged out
---
Do you happen to know total xp to 60?
---
If the player base hates bfa why would we trust current blizzard to design classic content?
---
Not scummy but you'll look like you were to the hunter haha
---
This comment aged well
---
To a point. I had someone tell me to stop offering to trade my engineered gun for trade goods in dun morogh general after I offered once. There are a lot of low level hunters that could use the DPS upgrade, essentially no market for level 5 guns in city trade chat, and I wasn’t aggressively spamming it. No conversations were happening at the time either. Sometimes strictly enforcing chat rules would effectively prevent community building stuff like “I have a great gun for you and all I need is some light leather”.
---
That’s why we run up on them and open trade, then it’s my node (just kidding I don’t do this)
---
But im not a rogue im a shaman. Shamans utilize int, no?
---
Pull too many mobs...That’s a paddlin.
---
thistleweed is the primary ingredient for that. So I'd see how much thistleweed sells for, and sell the thistle tea for about the same or a little more
---
Oh, ok, I see. Thx for the details! :)
---
Awkward
---
OP is just asmonshit trying to get views.
---
&gt; I came to Reddit.
---
That was your first mistake.
---
Well so far this stupid little imp is being a pain. I just want him to attack with me at the start of combat. I can shadowbolt something and the little dipshit just sits there till the enemy is 2 feet in front of me then casts his little fireball. I tried making a macro with /cast firebolt and the little tard will do it once. Then stop. Then wait till the enemy gets point blank and then does it again. I have firebolt on autocast AND have him on agressive. I also tried  /petattack but it doesn't work. I know it's because the imp doesn't have a pet attack but still. I just want him to immediatly and repeatedly cast firebolt when I target something and not wait till they are on me...
---
Literally 3 hours after blizzard allowed everyone to  reserve characters on classic servers most were full or high capacity. If the fact that Blizzard then had to add a dozen new servers, didn't tell you there was going to be huge que times, idk what other indication you needed.
---
You had the evidence before the game launched saying you couldn't be prepared is just a bad excuse used to blame the game and this sub is filled with these types of posts which I'm sick off.
---
They are indeed working in another MMO it seems like
---
Super woosh lol
---
Yeah, takes a lot of the stress away as well.  It's not that easy to powerlevel to 60 with shit greens on for every class.
---
You can go with something that directly benefits your class. Druid could go Skinning/LW and Paladin could go Mining/BS. That way they could make their own gear as you level. Just a thought.
---
&gt; Wow, you (or whomever made that channel)
---
I wouldn't self promote by acting like im not the owner of the channel, I honestly found his channel by looking up feralas horde flight points which I couldnt find anywhere else, and really thought that he
---
1. deserves more recognition for the hard work
---
2. the classic community could get a useful source for information out of it
---
&gt;  I still will skip it because all this info I can easily look up in text form in a few seconds (call me old fashioned) and I don't see any reason to waste my time on videos on such things.
---
im with you on that, I prefer text as well, but if you take a look at some of his videos I highly doubt you would find some things he made videos on, on a site in plain text, theres some really specific stuff in there
---
How many times are we going to see this here..
---
I’ve been enjoying it more than any game I’ve played
---
It was VC on Bloodhoof Alliance.
---
What other option did they have? Just let like ten-twenty times the intended population run wild? Would have been unplayable.
---
YEAH BFA IS SHIT FUCK BFA
---
You can be any class you want. All classes are needed in their own respect. Play what you want, you can enjoy all parts of classic with any class.
---
Thanks a lot for this, I appreciate it
---
For people who TL;DW — Classic WoW has the worst fanbase of any game. People who talk about classic on fansites are trash human beings. People who play the game and enjoy it for what it is and don’t discuss it any further are good. 
---
It’s a really lame argument and you can tell from the video he’s really upset with that post about him yesterday.
---
This is word for word my experience after the fix and people were running 5 mans. All the DPS are running around like animals pulling everything wondering why they're dying. These dungeons are tuned for 5 people, I'm not sure what they expected. DPS, you take way more damage than your shield friends, which is much more mana. Healers need mana time or mp5 time regardless. I am just suffering from the bad cleave down behavior this bred.
---
You sound like a whiny little asshole
---
Droods aint gimpy, u are if u dont know how to drood
---
Except my account which was in the queue at the same time as her for the same server did not have this happen at all, and went in smoothly. I was maybe 500 people before her in the when we joined. Remote access is definitely an issue - but this isn't that.
---
It has more mechanics than retail but they are hidden for you yo master
---
If I could log in
---
your not. people who keep their toons at level 10 are not twinks. a twink is for pvp with BIS and highest level for their bracket.
---
The whole ui there (including action bars) is ElvUI. But you can download Bartender 4 if you just want the action bars to be customisable. Does the same thing as ElvUI.
---
Skeram has a 106min wait time right now. If I wait to get in queue till I get home it'll be at 200min probably.

re-rolled priest after getting my hunter to 26. im level 18 now after 15 hours its not much of a time sink
---
Happened today. Called him a thief scum. His only response was: ":)".
---
Salty about what?
---
Spreadsheet, what?
---
I'm telling you how much xp people were getting *in-game* in 5mans and 10mans. And how long it takes over run.
---
Is that on your spreadsheet, weirdo?
---
I am, but Classic took almost 2 years to come out from when it was announced, so now is the time when Blizz will be starting to think about this.
---
It’s always been this way. It’s the reason why a gnomer 2h is BiS for feral. They are purely stat sticks, so getting the one that increases your attack speed by a flat % for X amount of time is enormous.
---
I know a lot of people agree with you about skinning, but I love it as a Warrior.  Those 3 seconds are enough for me to start regenerating some HP in between kills which means I spend less time and money sitting around eating.
---
If it's just a single quest mob in the area then it keeps targeting the dead one which is annoying
---
oh yeah, i've mistaken f4 with f76. my bad
---
thanks for the tip
---
LMAO.  if you struggle with the end game content this time around you’re just bad or don’t have the knowledge. It’s really that simple. Stop trying to make classic out to be super challenging almost all aspects of it are incredibly easy even the leveling. It’s just a time consumer and I can understand why players who didn’t know what to expect coming into classic are disappointed.
---
"IT'S A TRAP!"
---
I have one why do you think I'm not gonna waste my time watching vods like some neck beard virgin lol
---
If you enjoy the play style, any class/spec combination will work for you. There are definitely specific specializations that will not perform as well as others at the highest level but if you’re a first time player it’s not likely you’ll be at that level any time soon anyway.
---
Have you been smelting? That's where most of the skill points come from
---
You’re nicer than I am! If I find a node untapped in the world I drain it dry. I’ll give back with cheap gear for hunters or whatever, just gimme that ore!
---
What's so bad about that video? I don't see a problem at all. You use eye of killrogg to aggro mobs to you then you have your warrior spam demo shout to get all the aggro together and you have heavy duty cleave in the group to quickly kill them all.
---
What's the big deal besides the bugged XP in raid groups?
---
Over to the east from Goldshire at the Eastvale Logging Camp. You should have a quest that takes you to Guard Thomas, who is on the way.
---
Do you think blizzard will allow server transfers in the near future? Friends playing on different servers because of que times.  They think blizzard will open transfers at some point.  I'm not so sure they will.
---
Posts like this, while correct per se, aren't very constructive, in my opinion. Outside of hardcore raiding, the margins we're talking about are lost in a sea of confounding factors. 
---
The differences in gear, experience, motivation, level - these are all much more important than the theoretical dps ceilings of certain specs. Ferals *can* easily have top DPS in what WoW is for 98% of players.

GatherMate2 was fixed a few days after release and works now.

I guess it is a bit. There are some things from retail that are worth keeping but the bloated levels, lack of charcter growth, and worthless professions can all take a hike. Also, I love Classic through Wrath talent trees.

Hu what? The chest is distribute among the party autpmatically if its set to group loot? Or am I wrong? At least I've been getting stuff from chests while in a party without looting the chest myself
---
They literally fixed this same bug in beta. Now they went live with a diffetent client and bug is there again, it will be fixed again. FD + FT is a standard in Hunter PvP.
---
In Pve you used it to switch trinkets in raid. 
---
Not getting out of combat was implemented in 2.3.0  In vanilla it put you ooc.
---
According to many in this thread, this is impossible as everyone would compulsively accept anything given to them.
---
Same. This case I didn't have time to follow lol

Then I would use a macro to warn the /trade and /world against this COD practice whenever I saw somebody advertising for it.

Just get auctionator addon, learn the market and get rich in a honest way.   it's not that hard and when you get good at it will be FAR more profitable than any of these grey area crappy deals of you
---
As others have said - there is a cap in settings that you can adjust
---
I wasn't trying to get world first, and world first happened 14 years ago lmao.
---
All jokes aside, this is why classic can't be "the way it used to be" xd
---
Jesus christ how hard is this to comprehend? They couldn't show the PoV on stream. They *did* talk about them and follow them *many* times during the stream which is the *most* they could *possibly* do with their restrictions and, you know, *the law*.
---
people on that US streamer realm should just leave... its not vanilla server at all
---
So what is a "medium-full" server????
---
damn thats an angry boy.
---
I use nugenergy for my rogue. I believe it supports druid cat form as well.
---
Sylvanas wasn't able to raise the dead back in Classic IIRC and even if she could I think she would have been against it as she was still pissed about what Arthas did to her.
---
Fascinating, thanks!
---
And have you done classic raid? Because you speak Iike you haven’t.  They were easy and always will be.
---
It's the vendor price iirc
---
My wife after completion: "Man, you are ugly!"
---
There's never anything good in chests anyway. Literally every chest I've opened so far has just had random common-quality items in it like potions or vendor food or a few herbs/ores.
---
At least in pservers, you were guaranteed a green item in every chest.
---
Similarly when I was doing WC last week I was just trotting up to a serpentbloom at my own pace. All of the sudden I hear sprint activate and the rogue in the group literally used sprint to beat me to the serpentbloom. No shame. Says lol when I'm like "really dude?". Some people are just bad mannered and don't get it =/
---
Mad season, defcamp
---
Undead Warlock is fine. Orc warlock is better (for pvp) but both are good. You honestly don't really need any tips other than SAVE YOUR MONEY. The biggest spender while you level is class abilities from your class trainer. Only buy the skills you absolutely need. Keep the rest at rank 1.
---
Just have fun.
---
Also, don't respec. It's expensive as fuck. Make sure you have some idea of what talent build you'll use 1-60.
---
Yeaahh he reeeeeeally likes his privacy no matter what.
---
Did you see McConnellRet drop in on his stream for a chat earlier today?
---
please blizzard let that happen it would be just insane
---
Guess you also don't know about screen capturing
---
stop idolizing every streamer like theyre a hot new deity and guess what, you wouldnt care enough to make this post
---
depressing.
---
you know what a streamer is? a person with a webcam. theyre no better than you or i and stop treating them like it
---
Took me to lvl 24 before I completed lvl 16 mage quest
---
Be honest, did you have/are you having problems with flies etc ? I can just imagine the mosquito bites you would have if you did this in sweden. otherwise looks chill af
---
Is Priest the only class that can Rez now?
---
Go to Interface and enable auto-loot. Otherwise you have to click on every Item. I remember when I started in vanilla I leveled to 7 without looting one mob..
---
Came here just to say this!

---
Level 23 paladin, hoping to do some dungeons soon. Should I invest in some armor with +int so I can heal instead of trying to get a group as ret?
---
Yeah, Skeram always has a min queue of 180mins by the time I get home. I usually just log in using remote desktop to get it started early.
---
Looks awful + you already posted 'my classic WoW streaming experience' post literally 10 mins ago lol..
---
Those “shitty boe blues” can be a huge upgrade for everyone who isn’t following some bis gear, bis spec leveling guide. If I see a legit upgrade for my character, I’m rolling need unless it’s for an off spec or there’s someone else who needs it far more than I do.
---
ask for someone to invite you to a group. you will notice the mobs/people disappearing and new mobs/people appearing.
---
Just queue in time, it's not that difficult. You play on the Full and popular servers precisely for the reason you mentioned. You don't want to miss out. You'd want to play on the server where everything happens.
---
Sounds personal, I’m 6’8” since junior year, late twenties now, didn’t take an interest in sports not really the best looking guy but being tall is fucking awesome.
---
I didnt include a twitch link. :)
---
I am of the opinion that this template doesn't make sense. Why would an Orc sneak up and attack a Troll? Would make more sense if the Orc is Alliance. Just say'n.
---
Blizz operates like a bunch of studios under one name so I wouldn't expect much similarity behind the backend of the games. Also the only reason I know that only the GUI of WoW is LUA is because of the book that recently came out about the development of WoW.
---
Why do you think you'd get yelled at? Lol
---
“Good Game”
---
I remember saying "the game starts at 60, fuck levelling" in 2005.
---
To be fair, that's still true. I found the endgame way more fun than levelling.
---

---
Yeah there's being a bit cheeky and [using it for an hour or two](https://media.giphy.com/media/iE3oOyYvsgSAmSeUs1/giphy.gif) to get through the last level to 60 - and then there's OP [using it for two days straight](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85xnoIXebk3xYx4Q/giphy.gif) 
---
 to make bank.
---
There are a lot level 60's questing in the level 30 area's now to get items, money, and work on their professions after exploiting this leveling bug. No big deal, but its a PVP server. I've resigned to solo-grinding mobs on the edges of the map while looking for dungeon groups I can join. The majority of the questing area's are completely full of level 60's just killing everyone.
---
That's the definition of an exploit. Be sure to copy what you said in your appeal. I'm sure it will work out great
---
lol imagine being a person who plays alliance lmao
---
Also Warlock is great for new players, because it has a pet, so you won't have a hard time learning the mechanics! And warlocks are lots of fun! Enjoy your journey!
---
Do you have fireball on auto-cast? If not you have to manually click it for the pet to cast it. Enable auto-cast by right clicking the icon in the pet skill bar.
---
uwu
---
Just an old-school term for launching.
---
As someone who missed out on vanilla I much prefer the classic experience over retail however I am scared that the game might die off by the end of the year. I doubt it will but I am still worried.
---
A lot of whining on people who farmed dungeons 24/7
---

---
i disabled that addon bc it drove me crazy
---
Least he does not play like a  Légoläs huntard
---
We asked him to switch to warrior for tanking since he was so solid doing it as a paladin.
---
The higher level they are, the larger their aggro radius is to you
---
Tbh I see more toxicity and cringe from Classic than Retail.
---
On r/wow I see positive posts about Classic yet here I see a lot of superiority complex weirdos.
---
Something simple that takes a lot of time isn't hard, it is tedious.
---
Retail is miles ahead in terms of gameplay, difficulty and complexity.
---
Classic is miles ahead in terms of worldbuilding, atmosphere, community and RPG elements.
---
It is like watching an argument whether Dota 2 or CS GO is a better game. They can't be compared.
---
D3 isn't a bad game. It's a hack and slash that you know exactly what to expect every season, is quick and easy to go back and play through. After a few seasons it lost its appeal to me ust as bfa had. "Oh boy, here I go refarming the same gear for higher stats".
---
Rage is the correct response for any player who wanted to go hardcore in this game
---
Not really, Lua is fairly efficient, and if they can afford to run every spell in D3 through a Lua script I don't see how this would be too different.
---
But then there's probably enough knowledge about the inner workings of WoW servers to know the right answer anyway.
---
Azeroth auto-pilot ruining your experience, hmm?
---
I AH weapons, vendor armour unless it's +frost dmg or something
---
&gt; to avoid people like you
---
 People that want to PvP? That's probably a pretty smart move. Have fun on your PvE server!
---
What addon is it that shows which character has it and how much they have?
---
Definitely Madseason, you wont be disappointed 
---
The "doesnt feel the need to verbalize every single thought" is hilarious though
---
&gt;there isn't a huge demand for strength and agi leather armour
---
Guessing you play alliance? While leveling all the rogues, shamans, druids and hunters tend to roll for the same gear at least until level 40 (and shammies and hunters will sometimes want leather pieces beyond that).
---
Oh that triage quest, right.  Very challenging.
---
Not a problem, I'll get by somehow, there are other recipes that use other stuff..sure it's not efficient but there is a way. I may end up taking 10x longer but I am not in a hurry. The concept is just cool to me to level both at once.
---
The only way I've had enough gold for skills is selling wands. New server economy is great.
---
They MADE that choice as well. Let it go dude. Its not your money they are spending. It THEIR money. I don't care who is world first. If you said you were I'd say bravo good on you congrats. Then carry on with my life. Its a game and I treat is as such
---
LFR is the least of the problems of retail. It's just casual content that no serious player actually does and has no effect on them.
---
Cringy
---
the felsteed is, the dreadsteed isn't
---
It's weird to me how offended some people can get at other people's playstyles. Let them play the game how they want, and you play the game how you want. No reason for everone to be up in arms about other's decisions.
---
"I like my beer like I like my women: stout and bitter"
---
Ammo will not be an issue unless you're using some insanely fast bow: Anything below about 2.2 speed should just be thrown in the trash unless it hits as hard as your current bow or better.
---
With a 2.8+ speed bow arrows are a non issue and a 12 slot quiver will last you over an hour of nonstop grinding.
---
Bows with sub-2.0 speed are measured in GPH not DPS and should be avoided unless it's a massive upgrade or you're filthy rich.
---
At low loyalty a pet will chew through food but at max loyalty you'll only need to feed it like once every 15~30 minutes to keep it topped off unless you're letting it get killed a lot.
---
THE RIDE NEVER ENDS
---
I'm no expert but I don't think this is how it works at all in wow. They pretty much don't interact.
---
Someone just posted that they got banned for doing this. Not sure if true but I wouldn't advise using exploits.
---
Took me honestly like 8 hours to set mine up. There are options for everything. Just finished it yesterday.
---
This makes me exceedingly nervous.
---
It took me 5 minutes to set up a Remote Desktop (I recommend Chrome).  I only use it to start the queue a few hours before I get off work.  Last two nights in a row I got home to the character log in screen and could play right away.
---
There's places in the world where you have to sit and watch your kids die from starvation and there's not a single thing you can do about it, but people are busy complaining about how another person is playing a video game that came out 15 years ago. Really puts things into perspective.
---
It's been said before and I'll say it again. BfA is a better game, Classic is a better MMO.
---
What do you mean they run every spell in d3 through a lua script?
---
Gotta admit, I was a bit frustrated after dying 5 times in the blue recluse on the mage quest, finally overcoming the zerg of blue little devils, just to have 2 other mages just waiting until I did all the work and then ninja the trapped boxes.
---
&gt;Any ideas?
---
Just play the game with your brain?
---
What level are you? I’d roll an alt if under 30.
---
Keep the Tauren in an inn while you level an alt and grind out the double xp on weekends.
---
Note: Zanx died on the way back to her home planet
---
If you don't have any friends or guild holding you back I would suggest you to change it. You can get lvl 15 in your first playthrough.
---
I really like to stick to the basics and use only minimal add ons. But I do use stuff like questie and quartz. 
---
I play a rogue so having a energy watcher really helps:))
---
UwU
---
I will look into this for sure. I am more hoping to be able to play Retail while I queue for Classic.
---
It's a chrome app/extension, it's extremely easy to setup and use. Install it in chrome on your PC, login with your Google account. Now download the app on your phone, set a pin code and you're good to go. You don't need to have Chrome up or anything on your pc, and the pc can even be locked. You can access it within seconds on your phone, and hell you can even walk around in wow on your phone.
---
Just login at work or school or whatever, make sure you time it properly so you get logged in when you get home, and not too early so you get kicked due to afking. You could keep yourself logged in by opening the app every 25 minutes or so and moving around though.
---
I am. Thank you.
---
Rose tinted nostalgia!!!
---
The time limit is probably until retail's next expansion
---
What do you expect from a guild that has so much experience in the game that they probably know all the tricks in the book.
---
I'm a simple man. I see this meme, I upvote
---
I think that in lower levels as long as you keep up with gear you'll be fine DPS wise. The utilities paladins bring regardless of spec cannot be understated. Start up groups yourself and keep playing ret. Learn to save back Mana for off heals and maybe lean into your righteous fury a bit to off tank at times.
---
But also keep some int. gear around in case you need or want to heal
---
Walked in on a guy killing a rare in Elwynn and was about to whisper him, “get anything good?” But before I could, he /lol’s me and runs further into the mine. He’s fighting 2 kobalds while I loot the chest and mine a copper node.
---
He /spits on me
---
While this has always been a thing in Azeroth, you can blame the streaming culture and people who say "pepega". It has never been this bad, where people on your own faction want you dead to steal your loot. All it would take is 1 big streamer to start promoting community, charity, and teamwork to see a huge effect on the community. Sadly, it is a "me first" contest every single time.
---
Well, it's an elf after all.
---
Sure, we will all reroll from the full servers..  Once Blizzard refunds the 2 weeks of game time required for name reservations to everyone on those servers.
---
what you draw the line at lists? filthy casual. I still open the spell book and click on spells.
---

It was literally no different when vanilla was new.

How tall are you man? I wouldn't say I'm extremely tall (6'4) but I've never had any sort of back or knee pain what so ever.
---
My 2014 Acer Aspire is not gonna run this sadly, and beside my desire to play WoW for the first time in years (imagine how many times I've said this and done this) I don't need to replace it. The itch is real
---
Quality!!!
---
I'd love to but I played on private servers and got my fix.  I've always wanted to go back and raid properly so I did.  At this point in my life I just dont have the time to commit to it.  Im with ya, though.
---
Enchanting
---
he plays classic is what he is saying
---
You don’t. Warlocks are the druids worst enemy in pvp. You just have to survive until the lock is OOM.
---
Yeah, it's pretty straight forward to share the skill, just don't auto loot.. Was doing a quest with someone and we both had skinning, didn't even have to say anything and a mutual agreement that we would alternate just happened.
---
There's no direct evidence of this but there are some strong hints in game data that spell mechanics are coded in Lua. Something like, player casts a spell -&gt; run some logic, spawn projectiles, deal damage etc is all done via scripts.
---
You could run this on a potato hooked to a lightbulb.
---
So you're agreeing with me that your point was stupid?

What's a good Alliance server to play on? I don't mean good as in population necessarily as I have alliance on Blaumeux, but it seems like for some reason all the trolls and douchebags flocked to that server. Example:  
---
Yesterday I was on my hunter in redridge. I saw a mage who had aggroed like three mobs and was about to die. And so I sent my pet in to get one and I aggroed the other two. I ended up saving him. Seeing he was a mage I asked him nicely that if it wasn't too much trouble if I could get a stack of water from him being as how I was out. He opened trade, put a stack in, cancelled the trade then said to me "GET FUCKED, IDIOT!!!" then a minute later I was sitting down trying to regen mana and he ran a train of mob onto my character, then talked crap in whispers after I died.  
---
That's typically the type of player I encounter on Blaumeux. For every 1-2 nice people I meet, I tend to run into 7-8 more people like the guy above, so I was wanting to change servers.
---
What do other people have to do with madseason?
---
Turn off scrolling quest text in the user interface.
---
NA - Horde - Herod - Priest
---
Old returning player on a priest. Looking for a large social guild with folks who want to run dungeons and goof around a bit. I'm interested in raiding and maybe some PvP eventually, but I'm too old and busy to be too hardcore.
---
Noname55 (the creator of this smut) is really a god among men
---
Look, until Dire Maul is out it's DM, ok ?
---
That's the dream man. I love the brackets but man those rotations are boring as hell when you get a sub 40 duty.
---
Not confirmed. But there wont be free transfers from low pop to high pop, just from high to low.
---
Dialup in 2004? I recall having DSL by 1998
---
Only the money is distributed, any greens/blues/purps don't get rolled on
---

---
Because they wear Purple Overals. Have you ever seen Puprle Tauren? That's why.
---
I love this
---
Shift/Ctrl + Q.W.E.Space
---
I use them for things like cooldowns and my mount as I don't have to move my fingers for them
---
Use a password manager like Enpass.
---
Benefit from what stats? There is no ratings in vanilla.
---
But could I alt tab to thottbot? (Joke of course, I doubt that website still operates like it once did)
---
Aw come one, don't be like that. The toxicity comes from both sides. Especially those who play(ed) on private servers have been having hate boners for retail and its community for years now and that toxicity has bled onto this sub as well.
---
Shit, I remember just a year ago when this sub was mostly vanilla memes and screenshots of places ingame while now it's often streamer hate and circlejerk with retail WoW. 
---
I was one of the people against Classic for a long time, precisely because I was of the opinion the people from private servers didn't deserve official legacy servers. Yet now I am playing it, loving it and just dinged level 38 on my warrior. You can look up my comment history if you want and you can see that I'm frequenting both this sub and /r/wow. And you will also see that I usually reply to people who only want to see the world in black and white.
---
He isn't correct in **everything** but he also isn't wrong entirely.
---
Interesting interactions like this are the things that keep MMOs amazing and beautiful. Awesome!
---
This WHAT??
---
I’m tempted to play. I browse reddit everyday. I kinda want to because of the nostalgia but at the same time i’m unsure. If i want to follow my friends on their server it’s like 5 hours queue so i wouldnt be able to play after work... and i dont have much time to play and it is not made for casuals sadly. I’m afraid ill just give up if i quest alone and find it too difficult. :(
---
When things are getting too tough so you go to the class trainer to upgrade your skills. Then you go back and start kicking ass against the enemies you had trouble with before. It makes it feel like there's an actual sense of progression rather than just watching your ilvl increase

Yes I am using questie and have the same issue.
---
Don't play. I got hooked and addicted again and kind of neglected my family and career. I told myself I'm gonna play casually since I can't play for long, but it went out of hand. I am at level 32 now and today I uninstalled again, the grind is too long and there is just nothing new other than nostalgia. My goal was level 60 to do raiding and battlegrounds but it just takes so much to even get there. Played the game already for 10 years. Feels good to be in reality again
---
Hell, I had a pair of Priests that were on my "Do not kill list". Yea they were Alliance, but they had MC/Healed me out of so many situations that it almost felt like I had a Blood Debt to those guys.
---
It wasn't optimal, I probably lost a lot of fights for my team doing it, but I absolutely would not go for them unless they were the last two standing (or one had the flag or something and I had to).
---
Even seeing moments like that now, when I was doing my WW ax quest the Warrior I was with was just like: This troll is cool, if you see an Undead Rogue with a hood kill him he is going for you, that Orc will help you but don't take his tags or he will go for you. It feels like it's sorta coming back, not sure how long that will last though.
---
What fucking level 10 twinks, are you high on bananas?
---
*"Modern WoW feels more like a phone game, a time killer than an experience. "* 
---
I've been looking for ways to express this, and this was very spot on.
---
The added sound effects are fucking stupid. The music would have been enough.
---
This shit is the same as using a clown horn and a laugh track
---
What sort of hints? I'm genuinely curious how you would get such hints.
---
Furthermore, largely effects pvp.  Higher level through exploiting equals more time farming gear, equals a double whammy against people playing the game without exploits because they are now under leveled and under geared
---
Greens or blues from chests do not go to the group roll system. Anything in the chest goes to whomever loots it.
---
One is binding, Second is loose . . . . . . .  
---
And it's open. Wouldnt recomend.
---
Get Wand Spec in Disco, then go Shadow.
---
Fishing is quite easy and passive to level! You can honestly get anywhere between 60-80 skill levels in an hour if you’re doing it right. Plus when you come across the rare schools of fish and floating debris, there is real money to be made! 
---
Not to mention you can basically level cooking right alongside it, and make powerful buffing food of all types.
---
And being short is actually pretty awesome. I’m 5’3 and I fit into most spaces (not to mention leg space is literally never a problem), it’s easier to sneak up on people, and I can use tall people as umbrellas by standing next to them opposite of the direction the wind is blowing. This is coming from a girl tho.
---
Only 1500? Dead game.
---
You see; the content is easy. It’s the people you raid with that make it hard.
---
Through my entire online gaming experience; this point holds the most truth.
---
Oof. I'm afraid I don't know. 
---
Is there perhaps a frame over the top of it that you can't see? Try unlocking the frames and checking that nothing is overlapping. Aside from that I can't think of anything, sorry. SUF seems to be a bit buggy, a lot of people have been saying that Luna is better, it might be worth giving that addon a try instead.
---
And you a druid too.
---
This isn’t constructive or true at all. A feral will have to try 10x as hard as a regular rogue in pre raid quest gear using a cookie cutter spec and rotation in MC just to make middle of the pack. And then while that rogue continues to get gear through mc, bwl, AQ etc, it becomes worse and worse. Also it’s going to be drastically more easy for that rogue to continue to roll on gear unlike that druid.
---
What addon shows the enemy health?
---
I'd drop the $1,000 for a new laptop if I could do more than just play AND didn't have to get home from 9 hours of work to sit in queue and play MAYBE an hour. I feel ya

I'm so sorry for you that you get your panties in a twist when people have the audacity to complain about a game they pay a subscription for that they can't play outside of the early hours of the morning due to mismanaged availability. Must be a tough world for you pal if this kind of thing offends you so deeply.
---
Just google classic WoW macros for your class.
---
Seen Tinder joke atleast once a day chat ever since people started leveling in Wetlands.
---
Feral dps is pretty good, don't neet to farm pummelers to get the best dps. Being good dps (say top 8 dps) is great since you still bring so much extra to the raid and can also distribute gear better. The warriors and rogues that don't get the best gear will be hard pressed to out dps a good druid that power shifts.

Thank God it isn't your spouse

Antisocial, especially in Classic WoW with private instances.
---
Just to add, as an altholic, leveling is dreadfully boring and not challenging in the slightest. You get nothing for leveling half the time, and the story is all janky and messed up.
---
Classic feels like one fluid experience. Things are difficult and take planning. I love it:)
---
Yes!!!!
---
Ok bud, sure
---
AoEing down dungeons is actually a lot more fun than running this shit. If anything, it's too braindead easy to not pull half the dungeon per pull.

The coefficients on low-level spells makes +heal gear not worth it.

I kindly asked someone to party inv so I’d get credit for a quest mob kill . The child replied “you’ll wait around for your turn like everyone else “ “ welcome to classic” , as if this 16 year old twat has any idea what true classic was like.

You literally have no clue what you're talking about. Mcconnel hasn't been doing dungeon farms? He ran a 10MAN SM for like 18 hours the other day while listening to Sea Shanty 2.

If you're going to cry about people you don't know playing the game differently from you, you should at least know what you're talking about.
---
I do the same thing to Allies so it's fine.
---
I mean you're talking like this didn't happen in Classic...but this kinda shit always happened. Not everyone played the game like a naive noob lol. Powerleveling, goldfarming, and general exploitation of game mechanics aren't new to this re-release.
---
People are talking like races to endgame content are new.

They increased server sizes you twat

It shouldn't matter but for some guilds, when a person talks about their personal life, it does. Said guild might not have advertised itself as "straight," but it may as well have if it kicks and/or harasses the player. The guilds mentioning orientation in their ads are simply responding to stigma.
---
I took herbalism and skinning for my professions, and I am nearing 225 in both. At level 33 but my bank is only 25 gold - Is the 4g50s investment to take each of these skills to artisan level worth it now, or should I wait until later on (perhaps after I get a mount)?
---
FWIW I'm playing a druid so with sprint and travel form I don't feel like getting a mount immediately at 40 is the highest priority.
---
Good shit on the uninstall! I neglected work in the past, romance and friends, hygiene (in my earlier years) and so much more. I would fear the same addiction if I wasn't so finicky on getting back into it. Stay clean friend!
---
We had these like on Friday.
---
Oh just like the retail i think.. Anyways sorry if i sounded like someone who can only complain. Im just frustated at the moment. Really enjoying classic so far and now that i have school again it gets a little harder to play. I did not expect it to take so long with the servers. Never seen wow full like this and i expected a lot of people playing classic but this is just WAY beyond what i expected
---
Honestly I like stormwind for the open air, I feel claustrophobic in itonforge
---
Tanks
---
First hit's free, man.
---
Woosh!
---
The OP's head line reveals his perspective, upset that his cleaving days are over
---
Is Bigglesworth a PvP or PvE server?
---
Same issue here on Pagle. My brother wanted to play and created an account and subscribed. We both logged in at the same time and his position in queue never went down. It keeps going up. After 15 mins, I got into the server and he is now in a higher position than what he started.
---
Rerolling is much faster the second time with less congested zones and gold to fund gear and bag space
---
Sounds like you need new friends.
---
&gt;It hit me hard, harder than anything has in my life
---
It always does. Lost dad to cancer and even after the ordeal I couldn't figure out how the fuck i got there. A younger brother has to be rough. 
---
So sorry dude. I can't say the pain goes away but you learn to remember the good and it'll make up for the bad
---
&gt;?? Did you reply to wrong comment?
---
Obviously not
---
&gt;Did you mean the parent?
---
&gt;Seriously, learn to read and stop being a bitch.
---
I'm the one who can't read? Sure thing dude. Enjoy complaining about people playing a game on the internet!
---
Sell, unless you get a really good blue which is kind of unlikely. I am a warrior and just sell everything pretty much.
---
Aww that's cute.
---
I think the concern here is that he ganked the guy 6 times, which may or may not have been the case. Shitty if so. No issue if not.

---
Its possible to fix this... but not probable.
---
Have you been training your demons?
---
😍😍😍👌
---
I really needed to read this. Fuck trying to keep up with my guild. I work fulltime and ive been skipping sleep to level.
---
It's not necessarily a number of reports. A GM would have to review the report and deem your name inappropriate. If your name isn't considered inappropriate, they won't change it.
---
It depends on context.. where they an ass? Sure. Kick em
---
Kicked for being trans ? Not good
---
I'm calling the Campaign for Equal Heights on you.
---
lol boomers 4Head
---
There is already an internal CD which is increased everytime you fight in PvP (big increase to prevent fleeing target to change layer), fight in Pve, looting, using a node ect.
---
It also seems like once you change layer you stay in that one unless you once again join a group from another layer.
---
What did you get banned for out of interest? Got banned for 3 days a while back so I asked for it to be permanent.
---
Been warrior forever and its the only viable tank.
---
casting spells needs a lot of concentration and the heavy leather or chain would break it  and you are weak bookwurms that never go to the gym, so you can;t wear it anyway...  
---
those are the classic cheesy reasons casters always wear cloth in fantasy games
---
You can just aggro mobs and have your friends kill it for you real quick, no?
---
Yep, but I've never been completely sure of the differences between them. I found it fairly easy on retail to heavily customize ElvUI, but struggled to get almost anything done with the classic version (even after update + fresh install). After a full evening of tinkering and exploring, I pretty much gave up and resolved to build the  UI I wanted with more traditional addons. 
---
And yeah, SUF isn't perfect, but it let's me build the most pared back interface that I can. It's weird how so many addons just assume you want 100% information of all things all of the time. I don't. Just tell me health, mana, and what I can dispel.
---
Will blizzard give compensation for the queue times? 
---
I just waited 2.5 hours only to disconnect from the game and get sent to the back of the line. If they could move all my characters, names and items included, I’d be glad. 
---
Just sucks that we have to wait 5 hours for a couple thousand people in queue. With layering couldn’t they just move computing power from some unnecessary place to the full servers.
---
Do it like I did in 2005... "borrow" their credit card while their sleeping.  
---
If they spot the battle.net charge on a bill, explain it's for history class.
---
It's the age of grouping so you can't ruin your rep and expect to do much in the game
---
time to swap to exclusively 5 man cleave teams!
---
Dang. I removed in at 2:45 so I'll be able to get on at 4:30
---
That’s the reason why we have large que times. You’re literally the problem.
---
Dude... take care of yourself, honestly being this concerned about a streamer and how he plays a videogame is really weird
---
 Filthy casual here... Horde Shaman currently just on Level 17 on Gandling PVP Server, can Heal or DPS. I played Classic way back when it was cool, am in no rush and want to enjoy the quests and zones, looking for other fellow players for this, to quest together, farm dungeons together and PVP the hell out of the Alliance :) Feel free to add me on [b.net](https://b.net/) and message me: Boonatix#2950
---
Staying afk and abusing remote should be bannable, change my mind.
---
People who do this are basicly the same kind of people that ‘reserve’ chairs in a resorts swimming pool by throwing on their towels. It’s flat out disgusting.
---
I’m a hunter on Skeram named Hemingway with a pet named Ernest!!
---
And you didn't think to mention the name of the addon?
---
I picked warlock because I always wanted to roll one in vanilla since to me they had by far the best sets.  Also warlock becomes a beast during Naxx/AQ and there's also a ton of other perks like the free mounts and the utility that warlock brings to raids and group content.   There's also not a lot of warlocks right now since they are perceived as weak and not everyone realizes just how good warlocks become later on.
---
Auctionator will add vendor, auction house, and disenchant (based on average materials AH value) prices to item tooltips, you just need to scan the AH often to keep the numbers current.
---
Except it me and my wife that fell in.
---
I got some auction add ons to help me but i can't find information about was "converting" is. I got an enchantment related thing and the add-on was suggesting converting it as opposed to auctioning it or vendoring it. I just want to know what that means. 
---
Is it a private server?
---
Pantheon Rise of the Fallen! Hopefully we will see it in our lifetime. It’s been in the works for a while now and looks amazing.

---
The smaller servers really aren’t any different than the larger servers right now due to layering. There is only a certain amount of people per layer so a small server is going to feel the same as a high pop. I am on a low/medium pop server but was still struggling to find unkilled mobs in the Barrens last night.
---
How much is the starting mount?
---
Excuse me but how in the hell is even a full T3 guild supposed to clear MC in ~15 minutes? Even the fastest speed runs are still 30-45 minutes due to run time. Same for BWL
---
Every time I log into Herod other than the morning, it’s 5+ hours of wait.
---
Someone (cant remember who) said in an interview that Hunters were the hardest thing to recreate, I'm sure they would appreciate an actual bug report for this.
---
I was going to roll warr because i have played as tank all expansion except vanilla, but i went with hunter for unknown reasons to myself
---
i use it in emergencies or on dd's
---
Hunter is the easiest class in the game, both during leveling and endgame. Stop. Whining.
---
If you just wanted to play... you should have played and not spammed..
---
I pick warrior so this game will take forever :)
---
Addons were widely used even back in vanilla days so give it a rest with the hardcore-play style mentality you ding.
---
Lol I just googled "wow to many addons"
---
Twitch is cancer.
---
Sorry if the title is baiting! but  no i did not get 60, not even close (36, warlock) :)

Imagine that being your take away

**&lt;Moderna Misstag&gt; \[EU-PVP Shazzrah\] Swedish Semi-Hardcore Raiding \[HORDE\]**
---
 
---
\**About Us\**
---
We are a group of friends that have been playing WoW since Vanilla Beta and day 1 on the EU launch back in 2005 and now we turn all of our attention towards WoW Classic and we want you to join us!
---
We want to establish a Swedish speaking guild that will be highly respected on our server and have a great community who realise that real life responsibilities comes first and gaming comes second but who still want to have a great time playing WoW Classic. We offer a mature and relaxed raiding environment where everyone feels welcome.
---
First and foremost we want to enjoy our time spent playing the game and if we ensure that we and all of our raiders have a great time playing together then raid progression will follow. Besides having fun the goal will always be to clear all raid content at a steady and reliable pace.
---
\**Raid Times\**
---
Wed/Sun: 19:30-22:30 CET
---
We plan on raiding twice a week for the initial phases and then likely add a third raid day as we progress into the later phases and additional raids are added.
---
*\*Loot System\**
---
A DKP system will be used, exactly what version of decay/closed/open bid etc is not determined yet. Certain items will be separate from the DKP system, such as gearing up tanks but everything will be done with transparency and fairness in mind.
---
*\*Expectations\**
---
Attitude, Attendance, Performance
---
To us player attitude and behaviour is the most important aspect of being a good guild member, both in dealing with other guild members but also with the rest of the servers community. Poor behaviour on your part will not only tarnish your own reputation but also the guilds reputation and we will not tolerate that. That being said as long as you treat people with a nice and respectable attitude we will not have a problem.
---
Besides having a good attitude we want you to have as good of a raid attendance as you can manage, but it is our job as a community to provide you with an enjoyable experience so that you want to log in and attend raids and perform to the best of your ability. It does not matter if you have previous raiding experience or if you are completely new to the game as long as you are a team player with the mindset that the guild itself will always be more important than any individual member.

Gotta go fast
---
To be fair transmog is super divisive. Much of the ultra hardcore classic players seem to absolutely hate it, but there's just as many people (including me) who love it to death. Hell, I think about half my playtime on retail is blown away on farming looks for transmog and making new outfits.
---
But it's not one of the main reasons why many players are dissatisfied with retail currently, as its effects on actual gameplay range from miniscule to none.
---
It is kinda lore, a mage has to train the art of magic from a young age and can't train his body so good couse time is limited. Another explanation would be that it is harder to properly move in heavier armor so a mage should prefer cloth before it wears him down more.
---
In wow just sell everything what you can't wear, but I would first look if any guild member or friend would need it before it goes to the vendor.
---
That's the politically correct world we live in. It's bullshit.
---
That was a wild ride. Also:
---
"Getting your **** together would be really great. This is a bug from 2007 people, 8 years and counting. Are you kidding me?"
---
I've felt that way before.
---
Dear diary
---
&gt;  new players who have had their experience radically distorted by this bug
---
It really, really hasn't. Actual new players are unlikely to have been the level required to partake in this little scheme. 
---
The truth is, the "advantage" from this will be completely meaningless like a month from now and everyone will have forgotten this was ever a thing.
---
But that won't stop the internet from treating this as the hugest drama ever.
---
What’s reasons 1-12?
---
Mage because you can poly people, provide Int, have unlimited food/water, give people both... maybe. Got great single target and AoE DPS.  
---
Only downside is dieing in 2 hits to anything, but I guess that’s reasonable.
---
ITT: I'm better than you because I don't watch asmongold
---
I've heard there's cool people in China that will do it for you.
---
He means after you're done using it.
---
Found the rogue main
---
Not on that realm, but I feel you on your friends leaving you behind. 3 of my friends are up in the 30s and I'm at 24 with another friend at 20. I left my stonetalon mountain quests alone to level with my 20 friend tonight but yeah we've been left in the dust by everyone else rushing to 60. I'm just trying to enjoy the ride, and they've got other plans.
---
You saw people talking about your favorite streamer, got angry, replied to wrong comment, and now you're flustered. 
---
It's alright. Just read better and don't go looking for flights.
---
Love it
---
Press print screen or Windows key + S next time
---
Have a healer heal you out of group while you kill stuff. I wouldn't give up on the warrior though. It gets a little better with cleave. Then slam. Then sweeping strikes. Then whirlwind. Then Mortal strike. You become a beast once you get them all.
---
What else is there to take away? Nothing indicates they were kicked *because* they were trans.
---
I'd rather show her my Dwarven lumber (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
Subscription time is expensive when you are on a tight budget, right there with you brother. Save a few dollars a day, that's what I am doing.
---
I'm on a PvP server. It was a challenge :)
---
I love Legion. It's my absolute favourite. It was the only expansion I stayed subbed 100% of the time and cleared every piece of content on the highest level before major nerfs (except for Gul'dan) set in or the next piece of content released. It was the expac I added around 70 people to my friendslist, guildies and those from M+ groups. It offered everything WoD lacked. Heck, until 7.2 people were still running Emerald Nightmare and Trial of Valor on a weekly basis just because the AP gained from them was a pretty huge amount as well as them increasing the bad luck protection for legiondaries. It offered all I personally wanted from the game.
---
Yet I know its flaws and I detest them just as much as almost everyone here would. The RNG being the biggest one.
---
I've made several (more or less reasonable) rants about titanforging, the forced personal loot in every piece of content, as well as legendaries being non-targetable until the pre-patch. The overall package just was good enough for me to accept those flaws and live with them.
---
On the other hand you got BFA, which has every type of content Legion had at it's X.2 patch except for a mage tower equivalent, and one more (islands), yet none of its content feels worth doing for me and more like a drag I have to slog through.
---
I see your in queue as well.
---
That blue may have been their best option for an upgrade until level 30+. I know I still want smites hammer. Congrats on being an asshole and rolling need on something someome said they wanted. Don't need people like you in my life lmao.
---
For a filthy out-of-the-loop casual, what’s this mean? Were those guys too efficient to grind?
---
If retail would stop being bad we wouldn’t trash it. But I guess /r/wow is now a safe space from criticism.
---
I forget which one I used on Nost, but the one I saw when looking at add ons was ugly as hell. Thanks.
---
But in Classic it makes a difference if you pull two while in retail you might as well pull the whole zone.
---
How do I check my current setting?
---
You seem misinformed. Show me proof of someone getting a resource, hoping, getting another resource, hoping, and getting a 3rd. The devs talked specifically that there is a cooldown.
---
what are you even talking about are you using some autistic mind trick on me?
---
I added the link only just realised sorry
---
I dont think that at all.
---
Not really. People do dungeons for gear to speed up their leveling. Denying healers and tanks to roll on DPS gear just means they wont have a reason to do the dungeons in the first place. Its different at 60, but at any point before then, always expect everyone to roll on loot that will increase their damage output.
---
I've been sticking it out so far hoping they can fix some of these things, sent in a bug report and made a post here to hopefully bring more attention to it. More people are realising it once they ding 30 so I'm hoping its just a matter of time.
---
This is me but instead of fishing, it's changing classes and trying them all out by getting them to level 10 or 15 lol
---
You are supposed to share mining nodes since you can only get skill level from one click of it. That's what community is about.
---

---
Wands are good because it's rare to get them as quest rewards, but otherwise stay away for early and mud game.
---
I’d say okay classic. It’s cheaper and closer to the pace of OSRS
---
This. Out of group tag everything with moonfire and let your friends kill shit
---
I've heard demo talents are pretty mandatory for void tanking. Alternatively look up drain tanking strats.
---
No problem, I spent a level in shimmering flats at 34 to 35 killing turtles for the grey turtle shell stack of 5 sells 45s and skinning. After I got my scarlet monetary upgrades I was 38 and spent 1.5 levels killing swamp jaguars for grey drops, fangs and wicked claws which I sold on ah and again vendored leather
---
players can never get mod powers on official channels. Therefore LFG is not an official channel.
---
I played on khadgar! Paladin named Ungor. Back as Ungorr, the rogue, in classic.
---
Cooking is fine. Fishing is 100% skipable.
---
Are you aware of any other game addons besides peggle? Not a bad idea, haha
---
After the first person gathers it, a short despawn timer starts before it disappears for everybody else.
---
I'm curious what the viable alternatives were for servers with 20k people.
---
Yes, **I was**. That was 2016 (after the nost shutdown) and even 2017. Ever since then I started warming up to and even liking it (Classic). You could say I've grown up in that regard, which sadly, many in the Classic and retail community haven't even thought of in the slightest and instead try to push for their agenda of "Retail bad" or "Classic bad" at all costs, often even spreading wrong information or simply misinformation they got themselves from a third party.
---
And of course I've had the occasional hick ups of painting something in black and white. But at least I can see my own faults.
---
Tristfall Glades has this as well!
---
I just yell out BRUh to them. One time it was someone who didnt realize I was taking it and the other was a straight dickhead who I hope dies many times more than most does on their journey to 60.
---
as a trans person myself: I agree, vanilla genders only
---
That's why wool is expensive ;)
---
You need to farm humanoids around level 20. Not many good places for that.
---
I did? Care to cite the post that did?
---
You can learn most 2h from weapon masters. Ask a city guard for directions in a major city.
---
1 handlen weapon and shield for tankning, and 2h for dps 🙂
---
What makes you think it doesnt? It increases the armor of your equipped items, which bear form scales off of. The talent makes a difference of thousands of armor with good gear at 60.
---
But that's classic.
---
I played in Vanilla and would say that the chest etiquette is about he same now as then. Probably a little better today when i think about it.
---
I wonder why
---
Open world PvP raping people for example? Find some shammy or mage multiboxing on YouTube. Farming shouldn't be that easy. 
---
I don't care to be honest, if u have cash/time to maintain 5 accounts at once, I can only laugh at the eagerness to pay x5 for singleplaying wow. GL
---
On mobile right now so I am having a hard time finding it but it was only a couple posts above this one.
---
Whichever is the highest damage with the slowest speed. Go to stormwind and ask a guard where your weapons master is and train. They're i think 10s each, not sure if rep can play a part in price.
---
Still 12k on Lucifron EU. 500+ minutes. Not 23k as day one but still
---
I was looking at this laptop to play WOW at work too.  Do you recommend it?  Anything you dislike?
---
Perfectly timed photo, looks like you have the biggest staff ever known 😂
---
What happens if it spawns beside both of you and he is the one unlucky enough to aggro when he tries to quick run for it? 
---
I say it's fair game. Their mad dash for it was their undoing.
---
Such a great community.
---
living off the grass and drippings from the ceiling
---
I mean what are they supposed to do? Not play? That's pretty greedy of you to expect them to just hang around and wait for you. It's unrealistic to have multiple people level all the way to 60 considering schedules are completely different.
---
Well, using a bank alt you should never come into that situation as your bags shouldn’t be full to begin with!
---
Yeah  :)
---
Two people at a node that can be mined several times. Isn't it a bit entitled to claim the whole thing for yourself when you can easily split the node?
---
Oh god yes.
---
Everytime they try and make a mini-game it ends up just being annoying tbh
---
I entered the queue when I woke up at 9:45am and it is currently 1:11pm. I'm now 295th in line as of typing this, with an estimated 9 minutes left.
---
Where's a good place to level Alliance around level 30? All my quests in Hillsbrad are red, all the ones in Wetlands etc are green/grey.
---
Pretty selfish of you to make this all about you, bruh. Should change your name to Boogie.
---
2H weapons are going to provide the most damage for leveling for a warrior. Starting off, you'll probably not come across one until level 5 or so, so until then take what you can get. 
---
You need to train the ability to use weapons at the weapon masters at the major cities, each city has a weapon master who teaches a different 2H (ex: Mace, sword, axe).
---
No worries. I'm Just having a feeling that i went to far with the "real clássic exp" end i'm leveling real slowly
---
Right know i'm 40 waarior.
---
What is your /played for 36
---
Are you also multiboxing with the comments?
---
I killed a Paladin a couple of times today in desolace. He put up a good fight both times and I made sure to salute him before he released. I hope he had as much fun pvping as I did, though I'm sure a kill would have made it a little better for him. Either way, I couldn't have had fun pvping without him, and so I am thankful for him.
---
Interesting. Thanks.
---
Bad bot
---
Who cares about an eating boogers no life for real ?
---
Feral isn't bad. A player who knows what they are doing will outdps a stupid player every day.
---
Ita crazy how people want it crowded. Personally WoW was the best when you would randomly come accross people. Not see people all the time
---
I have 4 minutes left for my queue on Faerlina, I've been in the queue for 3:15 hours.
---
Made a character there. I'll give it a try. What are the queue times like during peak hours?
---
FD can fail/be resisted.
---
Yeah I get that part with new outfits however I really loved walking into Ogrimmar and seeing people in shitty looking gear only to spot the elite guys with the highest Tier pieces. They really stood out. Now no one stands out.
---
Wrath PVP was amazing, DKs were kinda op at first but every thing was viable.
---
Yeah no thanks
---
My friends seem to think I'm crazy when I told them I've occasionally had need/greed roll while playing solo. Happens whenever I get a green item such as malachite. I always get it when I press need. Has this happened to anyone? I know for a fact that I'm solo the instances that this has happened spanning back to when i was grinding solo in Brill.
---
 In case you reroll, figure I would give a tip though maybe it's very apparent. Level up the paladin to 35 since you are pretty close already. That way you can learn 300 alchemy and sell transmute+get tons of utility by having access to your own alchemist.
---
 28-35 shouldn't take very many hours if you only play it once you are fully rested.
---
this must be blizzard advertising for classic in real life!
---
Not sure how I see he was a bum. I’ve rushed packs to try to get an objective due to hyper spawn. And I can’t take on 3-4 mobs at once. Seems he just tried and failed? Why do we assume the worst intentions?
---
We did that on the stress test. 7 deaths Sounds about right haha
---
I hope wow will be here in 10 years time when my kid is 10 years old so we can play togheter.
---
I am so looking forward to play togheter with my son in the future
---
&gt; Claims streamers are somehow official WoW communities
---
&gt; Calls *me* the idiot.
---
This sub turned to shit because of people like him.
---
Paladins weren’t the gods of raiding or anything.  Hunters, Priests , Shamans, Mages, Warlocks, Druids, and Rogues all provides utility in raid building that Paladin didn’t, and Warriors were still the most used tank.
---
Example: 
---
Hunter: BM was a great DPS spec and one of the only ranger classes that could move and dps
---
Warlocks could soulstone, dispel, and didn’t need to be in the Shadow Priest group
---
Shaman had buff totems and the best raid healing
---
Mages still brought Sheep, Spell-steal, best AoE damage
---
Shadow Priests were the battery parcels your mana users needed to go all in the whole fight
---
Druids has Brez
---
Rogues have a kick, Sap, and the quickest burst cleave
---
Duskwood, the other day.

3 days 23 hours but  this is the first time i play Classic, so i dont have a leveling route learned yet, but I'm having a lot of fun :)
---
Stop complaining and suck it up, just turn it on and go do stuff around the house and come back to play.
---
wow nice, congrats!
---
Reflected light from a large area causes significantly less eye strain than staring directly at emitted light in a small area.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but there is no such thing as a “2 hand tank” right?
---
Nah its better this way
---
No worries, it only contained the following:
---
* linen cloth x3
---
* copper tube
---
* malachite
---
* ice cold milk x2
---
If it contained a BOE blue or epic, I’d definitely whisper you and let you know.
---
Very much tinted goggles. Unreal the stories being told as if some of this is new.

The aura doesn't remotely make up for the loss in DPS by inviting a boomkin though
---
And a bunch of recruitments just for this race.  And the race was to 60.

I just go with the ruleset: If you need anything, press Need.
---
True. Skill &gt; class
---
Huh?
---
nobody is forcing you to watch his stream or play on Faerlina
---
So I should go play in a server alone instead of following all of my friends (both IRL and online ones)?      
---
Because I didn't choose Faerlina, I choose my friends and guild.
---
The addon is suggesting you will get more value from disenchanting and selling the resulting essence/dust.
---
I don’t really care tbh. Whoever is closest can loot it and we can get on with it instead of coordinating rolls for some gray stuff. If a nice boe blue were to drop, I’m sure most people would be ok with rolling for it.

Should be fine. My buddy just used his i3 with integrated Intel HD graphics to play at launch and even with hundreds of players he was averaging around 40 to 50 fps.
---
The thing is sometimes people don't change. That ninja insulting everyone and going off on racist tangents might get better.... or he won't. Why waste the time bringing them to something and have them make a fool of themselves? I don't have a lot of time to play so I'd rather not ruin a nightly dungeon run with someone proven to be an asshat.
---
Yes they warned people about queue times multiple times. Roll on a server that’s not full and you’ll be good.
---
OP gets banned for some social meta shit, and then there's this guy actually encouraging people to break greater reddit rules

im honestly a new player to WoW and im really just looking for someone to help me out and play with wether that be a guild or an individual. Im willing to play on what ever server and play what ever character/class/race i need to. currently have a level 7 human palidin on Windseeker. feel free to PM me and ill send you my blizzaed info
---
Depending on what your GPU can handle, even capping it at the monitor's refresh rate would potentially help, if when uncapped it's going really high (the FPS, I mean).
---
The buzzing noise should sound like it's coming from your case, too, if it's coil whine.
---
It's also possible to OC a monitor's refresh rate, and sometimes settings in the monitor's OSD (on screen display; the monitor's settings) will OC and may be at least partially to blame for the noise, if originating from the monitor itself.
---
I just rolled on medium server windseeker I just hope it doesn't end up dead in a few months
---
The problem is inadequate server caps. I sit on remote desktop all day to to make sure I don't DQ. Fuck that I have the knowledge to it and I'm not wasting my time in queue to be fair to other people.
---
Today is the first queue I've really seen and its + 2 hour wait, once I go back to work I'm not waiting to play until after 8-9pm every day.
---
About TBC: 
---
I really disliked the spacey theme and especially the disconnection from the main world (azeroth and kalimdor). With a whole new World including a new big capitol city, WoW began to lose it's identity for me. The old continents went dead, only a stepping stone on a journey to a new World of Warcraft so to say. Perhaps i might be too conservative (or classic), but when i play a fantasy rpg i want little villages between woods and mountain ranges, some magical forests and whatnot. Exactly what WoW Vanilla and in some parts Wotlk delivered. Simply the World of Warcraft i knew from the RTS games.
---
I wouldn't mind smaller updates to the existing classic experience though, with events happening right here and not somewhere far away and disconnected.
---
Sorry for my bad grammar, english isn't my first language.

Accidentally missed a heal on a guy that died the other day and used my Rebirth on him. He was super appreciative. Always worth it :)
---
Don’t you mean Blizzard?
---
Will they really be that way for each phase though? I could definitely be wrong but I feel like the initial hype will die down pretty quickly and not really pick back up. Most of the people playing are not hardcore players. Many will burn out when they hit the mid to upper 40s and realize they are really only about half way to 60.
---
I might just say fuck it and roll on Netherwind, which is currently medium pop, but I really feel like I will regret it later.
---
It's like a bicycle thing u can peddle while sitting at ur desk
---
From my meager lvl 30 priest experience, I believe PW:S is not very mana efficient, it has useful properties (instant cast and spell pushback prevention) but should only be used if: a caster has an aggro, or to save someone (tank included) in a pinch, if something goes wrong somehow.
---
Exactly what I was thinking five minutes ago but I went naaah I'm just being paranoid.
---
When I used to play hunter, I'd just feign death, then loot while they got attacked.
---
Thats because you gotta go to Loch Modan for that
---
Deeprun Tram is probably worse.  Those things only stay still for maybe 15 seconds or so before zooming off.
---
I feel this.
---
If this was a feature how many people would be playing secondary characters on now low pop servers... yeah most of them, making it no longer low pop. Take that /s and put it back on your OP
---
I am a new player... can you only get pets as a hunter?
---
I thought you had to use Classic Threat Meter because they disabled regular threat API or something?
---
I dunno, as much as I am jealous, I'm not sure working somewhere like that would be worth it. 
---
As much as it is an anti-fun mentality, I go to work to do work. I enjoy working hard so that when I envitably burn a whole day off playing WoW it takes the edge off.
---
I rolled different faction. Never played horde. And I rolled a Druid at first. But just created a mage alt (my old char) and love the familiarity but with a new faction it’s still fresh
---
The other servers would become overpopulated from this.
---
There have been low pop servers since this whole thing started... People are signing up on high pop servers on purpose..
---
Played troll shaman in vanilla.. rolled dwarf priest for classic.
---
More like, "how will people know I like this one group who killed this Rag first and not this other that said they would"
---
I buy a lot of items on my alts. I dont care for saving money I just want to level and always check out the ah
---
Especially if that line has the name "Faerlina".
---
I was clearing mobs around a chest in a camp.  I was down to three mobs.
---
Hunter comes along and decides to pull the last three mobs before I could.  
---
So I stand by the chest and open after combat drops.
---
He says to me "wow"
---
Dude did not even consider that I was there already trying to get to the chest.
---
Next in stv I cleared the chest and was about to open it when a lower level lock decides to come over and try while I was just clicking on it.
---
He agro'd the mobs that would not have agro'd to me, but then agro'd to me since I had buffs ticking.
---
The lock then got put into combat so neither of us could loot.  I fear and run with 5% life left.  The lock runs too.  I know they are both agro'd to us.  The lock starts killing a witchdoctor.  The entire train then comes back and ignores me because the lock has buffs ticking.
---
I watch as the lock gets face rolled.  
---
I felt vindicated.
---
Neither of us got the loot but at least he died.
---
You just replied to him ...
---
Yeah bro I saw, I didn’t know how fast dungeon levelling would be, glad to be proved wrong
---
My solution as a rogue is to pull the mobs and let the guy attempt to ninja it then vanish on top of him to make the mobs aggro. Then once he's in combat I can take the chest at my leisure
---
On RP realms it would be worth it.  It depends on the demand for the pet on the server
---
Pretty much anything modern will reach 60fps. Even if not on max settings
---
Someone already got this ring on launch day or the next.Cant remember when it was.
---
Yeah no everybody used these back in the day. I draw the line at things that actually undermine the core design. Not having to count my gouge timer in my head is not part of the core design.

Imagine actually spending $40000 on a bit of metal that goes slightly faster than other bits of metal. Keep fuelling mindless consumerism fellas.

Then respec at 60 to mm for 10s
---
I am a Blacksmith and a miner, but I only have an 80 in Blacksmithing and a 130 in mining and want to keep mining. Should I switch out blacksmithing for skinning?
---
How does OneBag3 compare to AdiBags and Inventorian?
---
Are you playing on Skeram?
---
there has been nonstop criticism of BFA on r/wow for the past year. Do you live under a rock?
---
Or they can have fun their own way
---
Is there an addon that shows all the quests for an area? I want to try and complete almost every quest in an area (other than the ones with long waits for a rare spawn).
---
Yeah, I know about this, but it doesnt exactly help when it doesnt show where they are, cos in Stonetalon, there's 2 different levels of footlockers and I cant find the lower level ones
---
I saw that fucker in shimmering flats the other day!
---
Same thing happened to me ratchet just isn’t connected to any of the night else towns I think
---
Wasn’t in vanilla need an addon for that. I think it’s called realhp bars or something.
---
\#REKT
---
the whole point of making wow classic to keep it "classic".  if they start putting expansions on, it will no longer be classic :/
---
Orc 110%
---
Clearly you didn't read the entire post, I addressed this.
---
Did you get it working? Mine is just constantly pulsing as well
---
Soon we will have the Black Lotus skirmishes, THATS where the real salt is.
---
Was horde all those years did all quests manytimes so now I play Alliance and its like New game for me.
---
About halfway through level 28, did nearly every quest in Thousand Needles and Hillsbrad. The quests in SE Thousand Needles are too tough. Been grinding wyverns to try and reach 30. Any places to level that I may have overlooked?
---
Ganked
---
But the community
---
No its well deserved modern wow has done away with all the tenants of an mmo and deserves the criticism.
---
Honestly get a little gold and buy some low lvl greens for your Alts. Then use one of those automated questing guides.  Gear Makes a huge difference and also being efficient with quests and turn ins.
---
If that's your way to enjoy the game, play retail. If you enjoy the classic way, play classic. Different people enjoy different things.
---
Richturpin
---
You could do some of the later quests in Duskwood, Ashenvale or start venturing into Stranglethorn.
---
That's what I'm saying....
---
All these guys trying to push us all to play it like Darksouls 3 as MMO.
---
Pets you control and fight with are used by hunters and warlocks (their pets are demons). This is a pet item, it has no use other than to summon a pet like this bird which follows you, they can be used by any class
---
EXACTLY!! keep it wow classic CLASSIC! dont put expacs on it!  keep it just like this.  this is fantastic!
---
I recommend everyone take skinning for the green money it generates then drop skinning at 60 and learn a prof. However as your blacksmith is 80 may be worth keeping it. Perhaps you can make some craftables to sell. Shining silver breastplate rings a bell? Silvered bronze shoulders aswell
---
Your nan is an elderly woman without as much of a need to foster emotional tools and social skills. I doubt she knit 8 hours a day when she was younger than retirement age.
---
Nope, went back to shaman and made my warrior as well, the only change is they have grey hair. Theyre 15 years the wiser now.
---
I've noticed this as well and it's been a peculiar experience.

---
So hunters get pets which will fight with them in combat. This little whelpling is a companion. It is only cosmetic and will not deal any damage in combat.
---
Dont buy all your skills as soon as you level only get the spells you use on a regular basis.  Just doing this should be enough to buy the 40 mount
---
Ah, gotcha. Sorry, I tried googling it and that seemed like the best guide. I don't personally have experience as a rogue, was just trying to be helpful. I wish you the best of luck!
---
No, it metaphorically went over your head.
---
His joke was the literal one.
---
Engineering is the only proffesion that matters.
---
It's the only proffesion with exclusive items and are extremely over powered.
---
People seem to think proffesions are the only way to make money but running dungeons and selling the cloth/items will make just as much. Unless you have a extremely rare pattern that no one else has.
---
No you really didnt, not accurately or sensibly at least. Queue early like the rest of us.
---
BIS for twinks
---
Aspect of the cheetah outta there. Gotta live up to the hunter stereotype
---
Because zoomers know how to use a cellphone far better than a PC.
---
Blizzard estimated their entire modern wow base would play classic to see what it was like before leaving back to BFA.
---
So they made a limited number of servers and just decided to use sharding to further divide those aervers without making new ones.
---
Its been bad so far. Ppl have exploited it for farmed materials or to respawn mobs to power level. Also not much PVP going on because layering means the world can feel empty a lot of the time.
---
Yeah, on classic classic settings it only stutters when the particles are going nuts
---
Have you tried 11?
---
Pish looks like a boss
---
“I know what you did”
---
Or when they come up and trade you mid swing of your pick, you close it which cancels your swing and they ninja it, so good
---
Fantastic post! Some solid tips here I’ll be using and sharing. Thanks!
---
I’d like to thank you on behalf of all the warriors out there!
---
Dang, thats super dope!
---
&gt; What exactly are you saying then? That MC is easier than the current retail raid? I agree but I already said that.
---
Classic experience is using print screen mate. We didn't have fancy camera phones in 2004.
---
I’ve tanked and healed dungeons from WC up to SM so far and the dps doesn’t give a shit. They just attack as soon as the mobs are pulled. As a tank, this is fucking annoying and as a healer, this means more of a challenge but I’m out of mana far too often and far too quickly. 
---
Please respect the tanks and give them a few seconds to build aggro. Not everyone has to rush dungeons. 
---
Also a bit of CC is always welcome!
---
So is it ok to tank end game dungeons like, ubrs lbrs strat scholo brd, as arms with tankin gear or at laeast sword and board ?
---
Lol? The problem is not 'literally' him. The people remote desktopping in just make a bad situation worse, and the afkers even more so, but I don't blame them. The problem was how blizzard released the servers.
---
More of a joke. Sort of a play on words where resist is used in both instances but carry different meanings.
---
I always have to group in org to trade
---
I've stopped ressing random corpses since it doesn't wart you on a PvE server that they are flagged (and thus casting res flags you). I play here to avoid ganks, sorry.
---
If I see them die blue though, res inc!
---
Yes, that's a decent option - tanks putting together Stratholme Live groups often reserve the first righteous orb drop.
---
Alternately, you could pick up mining - BRD has several dark iron ore nodes inside, as well as the two guaranteed rich thorium veins inside DM East when phase 2 happens.
---
I feel sorry for you that you can't see how much you ruin the game
---
Interesting, have they said anything about fixing it?
---
Molten core is literally the simplest raid. It's not all like that.
---
Thanks. I had thought that it might not be efficient in terms of hit point per mana point. 
---
I had used it preemptively, and do so when questing out of dungeons. 
---
I am wondering though if using it actively prevents the warrior from generating rage.
---
Being tall is no fun, we're all forced to hunch over to fit through doors or make attack animations look less janky for the devs.
---
&gt; Let's stop pretending BFA has no merit.
---
I've played and raided in every expansion since BC including BfA. I wouldn't have done that if I saw no merit in it.
---
&gt; The main problem is that so many classes feel the same in what they provide to a group, and hybrid playstyles aren't really a thing.
---
I totally agree, having the class flavor back is a big reason why I prefer classic to Retail. Another big reason is the existence of challenging content outside of a single end tier raid. I'm tired of soloing every group quest in my sleep while spamming the same sequence of buttons on my keyboard till I get to the only engaging piece of content.
---
Hah. It must be tough.
---
So basically I'm glad I haven't resubbed yet. People will keep crying then we'll have retail but with vanilla content then I'll resub
---
it is what he’s doing, but this was a poor screencap
---
Weapons sell well and often. 
---
Armor not so much unless it happens to be particularly good.
---
When I saw him, he was then running back from aggroing towards someone else and he was going at like 5x Speed. Absolutely shit my pants.
---
This is how tween girls get when you criticize their fav singer.
---
&gt; I reckon the ones causing trouble are those that are still in the Retail mindset.
---
Did you play in vanilla? In the low level dungeons people were just as  impatient as they are now.
---
I found a parrot cage, is there a way to name the parrot?
---
Ive watched several ppl die on underwater quests because I didn't train water breathing.
---
I was enjoying questing and just starting to feel like I was getting the hang of things and then my friends asked me to go to a dungeon with them. My experienced friends took the lead and didn’t give much insight and I left feeling very overwhelmed, completely useless, and frustrated. I thought it would be similar to questing but I’m a group (?) but it just made me feel like a noob and overwhelmed.

---
No, what you’re comparing is a hardcore feral to a dim-wit Warrior/rogue.
---
That might be what you’ve observed in a specific guild, but that’s hardly a fair comparison nor what you should expect going into classic with all the knowledge we have.
---
When you compare the two with equal time investment, the Druid will always come up short; the Druid simply won’t come up *as* short as say a ret Paladin would.
---
Try Questie it should suit your needs

24. I considered packing up and moving yet again, but I just didn’t trust that the new servers that just opened wouldn’t also have a queue a day later. And it turns out many of them did.
---
Honestly, the only other rpg to give me the same satisfaction as classic is OSRS. I feel like classic has its grind to fun ratio down a little better than osrs though.
---
Definitely, I think the modern game has a serious problem attracting new players in general. I think the biggest problem is that a new player just can't start on even footing with everyone else. Even if it's the start of a new expansion, players that played the previous one will still have a knowledge advantage and getting boosted straight to new content will be overwhelming. I think that's where classic excels. New players are able to learn without the feeling that they don't belong in the game.
---
Eh, potato/tomato
---
The problem - I find - is that the kinds of people who enjoy playing games like this hit a point where they can't brute force through things any more. At which point they start whining to the devs. And if the devs listen, well, we end up with Retail wow.
---
It happens just through normal gameplay, you're not doing anything out of the norm. There's also enough plausible deniability to say, hey they didn't figure this out in Vanilla. That's what I thought it was like personally considering all the other things people back in the day never figured out.
---
I like that name. lol
---
Play the game or don't and then also use the search bar for the other 1000 posts of people posting this exact same thing
---
While this is awesome, it's worth noting that WoWs longevity is thanks to the stylised graphical approach the game cleverly adopted. Back when games like LOTRO were going with more realistic looks, WoW was conciously stylised to make sure it could stand the test of time. And here we are today still playing it.
---
You can make money by offering to enchant other people’s stuff for tips/their mats or cost of mats, or selling enchants on the ah. Or sell the mats on the ah at a pretty good premium. Higher level enchants can be worth better than the things you disenchanted. That’s if you don’t want to relevel.
---
If you do decide to take up skinning instead, you could probably level up pretty quickly if you’re on the right server, in the right starting zone. On Mankrik, it seems like no one in Dun Morough took skinning (at least before I left for higher level pastures), and it’s all “kill all these animals,” so skinnable bodies just litter the ground. Check your available starting zones before you decide.
---
When I resubbed before classic, and was waiting for it to drop, I went on a old char who had mining/jewelcrafting. I’d unsubscribed after Cata. Dropped Jewels for Engineering on a whim. This was not a good call. Blew through hoarded mats and my bank like crazy to level that up. Got some fun toys though. 
---
But that’s on retail where the economy is pretty damn crazy, and a straight product profession. Dropping for a straight gathering profession in a young economy might work out better for you when it matures and folks make new toons, or it might not. It’s hard to say. But, the uncertainty is part of the fun. Keep that tailoring though. We want those bags.
---
Pvp not pve
---
I enjoy the control and utility along with all the timesavers
---
The big issue with classic raiding is the fact that everyone knows what to do now. Everyone knows what they need, where they need to be and theres probably even an addon to remind you to check your posture or text mom to wipe your ass. But, a lot of people never had the opportunity to clear all the vanilla content. A lot of people never experienced the PvP grind. A lot of people never even got to level in Vanilla. I think Classic overtaking retail is viable if you choose to challenge yourself. Someone kills Ony with 40 people? Try it with less and less and less etc. There's a ton to do in Classic and I think a lot of people will stick around and enjoy it.  One of the things I'm really looking forward to is the removal of layers and to see how communities evolve on a server full of people from the same server.
---
Delete this.
---
it’s not streamers.. ppl have always farmed SM even back in the day. it’s ez for horde and if you’re walking there as alliance you better make the walk worth it
---
Those fish are worth nothing. Vendor them. If you need to destroy items while questing, start with those fish.
---
This was actually the text in vanilla, too. The questgiver doesn't know that Varian is gone.
---
You're incorrect, raid XP NEVER gave this much in vanilla. It's a bug.
---
Looks better in wow tbh
---
No, what they said was the temporary inconvenience of queues was the EASIER option, because merging servers requires a lot of resources
---
Farming fire elements is pretty good
---
*apply faerie fire
---
I love mind soothe. Whenever there's a humanoid quest, you're like a better rogue that can also loot objects without drawing attention.
---
LOL
---
ppl thinking its Blizzard making this
---
Well, if they're experienced, they've probably run the dungeon hundreds of times. Once you run each dungeon a few times, you'll start to figure out what's going on. I imagine they just sped through it, so for someone new, you might've missed a ton of stuff. 
---
Maybe run a few on your own without them. Typically random's will go a bit slower.
---
Lol I play both but let's not kid ourselves, BFA raids and mythics definitely require more skill than anything in Classic
---
This was me in a nutshell XD.  Been playing classic. I logged into retail to see if I could finish up a rep grind I done for a few weeks many many months ago. Was completely lost with all the shit in my bags, and the shitton stuff all over my screen XD.
---
... They're off by default tho?
---
no one talkin bout the fact that guy got the name "Cersei"

What about losing aggro? Defensive stance allows taunt.

People during overwatch launch: Bastion is op and needs to be nerfed

Blizzard: have you tried switching to a character that counters him?
---
People to this day: ?????????

People: These server que times are bull, wtf blizzard.
---
Blizzard &amp; other people: you could try a different server, a lot of people have done this and it got rid of the ques for them.
---
People: ???????????????
---
A lot of people arguing since it is in the game they cant be abusing it. Just throwing this out there blizzards official code of conduct does say exploiting bugs is cheating... or for those being extra nit picky. "Any activity that grants an unfair advantage is considered cheating." So this is certainly against ToS. 
---
Realistically though it come down to if and how severely blizzard will want to punish it. They will probably not want to punish too harshly for this considering they were aware of the risks and wanted to use layering anyway. Honestly I'm for layering because the population will probably eventually die down, and I would rather not have server transfers.
---
If populations dont die down in the next month...well then maybe then reassess layering.
---
Fuck that guy Darbarcy, female Tauren are great!
---
I don’t know why this is getting downvoted when it’s true. On U.S. servers that were opened after Dire Maul was released it was pretty common.
---
&gt;Even fishing.
---
No fucking kidding. I completely forgot about fishing until someone I was grouped with gave me food that was better than my conjured food and water combined and gave an mp5 buff for 15 mins. I resolved to get my fishing up as high as possible once I hit 30.
---
You only get your PvP gear through rank ups, which are not possible without time. Classic is a timesink.

Me too man.. me too

I ran through there thinking the same thing just last night.

I bought a helm for my 26 warrior today with plenty of str sta and agi, and for less than a gold. I was not wearing anything before. The power is overwhelming
---
How phyrric. lol
---
Did you play vanilla?
---
Cuz this is exactly what it was like.. 
---
Give it time.. see if people actually keep playing.. if they do.. they might offer free transfers like they did back then..
---
The more i play the more i realize i love having every class there, the big difference is the people playing them, every class has a reason i love to have them.
---
Rogues can take difficult targets out of fights so quickly reducing damage against, paladins can heal if the healer goes down or bubble them if they draw aggro, not to mention blessings and auras, same with druids being able to tank/heal if either go down or need help.
---
Hunters can basically offtank 2 mobs on their own with their pet and by kiting/trapping the other. And the list always goes on, more about the people playing the class/spec than the spec they choose
---
Pretty much. Who cares. Let them blow to 60. It’s not affecting most players. Well it might affect me with lvl 60 gank squads but fuck it bring the pvp
---
Three quarters of the 40 man raids are easy as shit

In low level dungeons it really doesnt matter if you pull aggro on a mob.
---
ty
---
I could have done a better job explaining it, I agree. In this case I meant the ability to pretty much play through everything in retail solo, even joining dungeons and experiencing raids which are of course group activities but require no or at least very little interaction with your fellow players. Individualistic is perhaps the better word for it? I’m not a native English speaker, some things translate weirdly from inside my head to writing them down I suppose :’D
---
I am playing on one of the newer servers they spun up and I am currently sitting in a 1700 person queue to get on.

Why wouldn’t they make them work is what I don’t get. Pretty stupid. Summoning stones were a staple when I started, made it easier to get to a far off dungeon..
---
Earth shock also generates a lot of threat.
---
Has to be rogues
---
there really isn't a best pet, but that second link will tell you everything you need to know. this isn't retail where everything is simple math so you're gonna have to fuck around with it and figure out what works for you. your pet isn't useful if it's dead so keep that in mind. it's not going to be like retail pvp, your pet is going to die a lot. it's worth it to LOS a hunter and kill their pet then rush them which isn't a legitimate tactic on retail
---
That's so amazing and perfect in every way! :D
---
I always play ranged dps in games, and I love magic so I chose a mage in vanilla.  Have always mained a mage since and probably always will.  I even mained a mage through server first hardcore sunwell progression.  I did level a fresh 70 lock for brutallis until we got him on farm though :-/

Is that the place where you encounter Maw, the legendary bronze dragon whelp pet that can transform into any other pet of your choice?

I witnessed well over 30 people argue for damn near an hour if BFA should be called retail. If it wasn't that, they were whining about how bad they thought BFA was. Like, just be glad you're here and get over it.
---
Nepotism driven industry smh
---
Damn, ive been completely ignoring demo shout. This is probably one of my biggest mistakes. Thanks!
---
Had a guy try this, pulled a camp of 4 gnolls with my buddy and this dude runs in to loot. Gets put in combat and we manage to get the chest after clearing all our pull. He was adamant about him going for it first and somehow we were stealing. People are shitty for literally greys and a piece of food.
---
This isn't working, voidwalker still does nothing when I cast curse of agony.
---
18g at lvl 31 is well on track for mount by 40.
---
If you play more than me you are a not lifer hurrrr
---
Yeah that’s a dick move.
---
Stay away from AH unless selling itens picker everything up even greys and vendor them and youll make it
---
Hi CTO here.  Modern software just requires that you update the DLLs and so forth.  Even MS SQL you can upgrade without server reboot - however your DB will not work as you need to shut them down.  I run a 1 million dollar/year  SaaS business  and we have 5 9s uptime because there really is no need to reboot except to install patches, which is quick on a VM.
---
And then you see a hulking abomination coming straight for you.
---
this is incorrect
---
I don't know how simple this is, but does anyone have a good addon for auto dismounting? Thanks
---
So weird you stalking me? I just watched this movie today.
---
an instant log in
---
Thank you so much, great information!
---
omg! I just tamed him first chance I got and it was soooo cool. Using the beast tracker felt like actually hunting this great beast and finally having him as a pet gives a huge sense of acomplishment!
---
I'm honestly jealous. I wish I could forget everything I know about this game and discover it all over again.
---
I want the mats though. If he gonna trade me the stuff fine. But I don’t have time to express my opinion and have him say yes or no. And wait for trade. 
---
There’s plenty of nodes out there.

In game...

This is a true story. AH right now is tough to make money on because people don’t have money to buy mats or gear. Gonna be tough for a couple of month I think to make gold off of mats farming.

In redridge mountains there is a lumber Mill that has respawning lockboxes to train skill

I did this on launch day

Mini wheats
---
Yeah, it was almost like you did it by choice -- amirite?
---
Not even remotely, they have completely different meanings.
---
Just went over 2hours of video content he had, it looks great but didn't cover my question however.
---
As myself in the past, he is in the arch-type mindset where he either goes full elementalist or full enhancement and builds gear accordingly either as much agility as possible, either as much INT as possible.
---
What i've experienced so far, that low level up to mid 40ties, you shouldn't specialize as much in one build type, but mix both for maximum effectiveness, as in build quite a bit of INT on a ENC build Shaman, for considerably less downtime and higher burst via max level shocks.
---
Yeah, I think that's right. When I ran up to darkshore, getting that FP then opened up Astranaar to the other FP I had already gotten. It's as if it is locked to a destination until another night elf FP is discovered that connects to it.  
---
Strange design choice.
---
NTA, end game you be wearing some leather gear too. Class armor doesn’t exist here so no bonuses for wearing only plate or mail etc...
---
Cataclysm never happened in classic yet, so all the quests are the original story before deathwing shattered Azeroth.  There aren’t really any nice and tidy quest hubs in classic, and no hand holding.  You figure it out, you go do it, you come back and get your reward.

Is this....Silent Hill?

Yeah it's weird, there was the War of The Ancients, and then fuck all happened until the Orcs invaded almost 10K years later
---
I’m just referring to people saying that anyone would accept gold viewers gave them. This is somehow excusing Asmon because it’s just silly to think that anyone would refuse free gold...and yet Mad Season does. That’s great.
---
sorry we all havnt played this game for the last 15 :(. I only understand a raid is a dungeon and I'm not even sure if that's correct.
---
Do you know where the Horde Succubus quest is for the Horde?

It's beyond ARATHI.

I remember doing that quest for the first time, crossing half of the Eastern Kingdoms and dying, dying, dying, dying...

If you ever plan on solo aoe farming, yes.

Can you post a screenshot of this? Would like to see it in action before running it. How would you reset?

Projection gets you every time.
---
If you are on a PvP server it could affect your game if the other faction out levels yours. They could farm contested zones and make it difficult.
---
Not disagreeing with you, just pointing out one side of the argument.
---
In bird person, this is considered a dick move. I'd make sure to never run with you ever.
---
PVP happens!
---
Queues are a meme. Meme-ers trying to play on meme servers for memes. If you want to just play the game... Play on literally any other server, literally any of them it doesn't matter. I've never waited in a single queue. If you want your life to be a meme, well... there's nothing we can do to help you here.
---
Just gank.  Make enemies with the opposing faction.  If you run into someone 2 zones later and they still want revenge then you're doing it right.
---
Take my updoot
---
Yeah I think its RealMobHealth or something similar

Not really if it was an upgrade for you too.

On the flip side, if it rains too much it will turn into Cata Desolace
---
in chat the names are class colored, imagine that, you don't need a picture
---
a priest's name is white in chat, a druid's is whatever color they are (i'm colorblind, orange or gree), etc
---
As the others have said, its the tanks job to set the pace.  Mention that you want to know the whats/whys.  Other than making sure people get their quest completions that might require a side path, the only thing im stopping for as a tank is health/mana regens UNLESS someone asks.  Tanks rely on rage built in combat (if warrior)  and it degrades out of combat, so steamrolling through things is best for us.  That said, Always soeak up if you feel your lead is going to fast or youre getting lost

I don't expect to have more than enough. I just want to know if I'm on track for the mount when I hit 40.

Nope I just waved and told him to /wait

How do spell/melee cleave groups work? Bit of a newbie question.

Come join us for leveling and then dominating all aspects of PVP content.

We will be THE leading horde pvp guild on the server Sulfuras. 
---
* Open world PVP 
---
* ganking, camping 
---
* steam rolling battlegrounds with premades are all in the plans.
---
* Occasional pve for gearing as well will take place.
---
Participate in all of this while laughing, and having a blast from the past with friends. Please DM me for more info and invitation to the guild and discord.
---
No problem! An extra note that helps with speed, which usually makes your dps happy, bind your mark target icons (skill, X, Moon,ect) to a key system that works for you. 
---
I personally dont use any ctrl binds except for marking targets. I rarely need them in combat, and it makes marking a pack WAY faster than clicking through all of it. Gotta help my tank fam!
---
Lol more like "stole chest" or "ninja looter" or "dick wad"
---
Bud, it’s literally a rogue set with rogue set bonuses.
---
Very strange since Stonetalon Peak is just over the hill and doesn't connect...
---
You've got that the wrong way round. If you give that much of a fuck about some open world chests that you'll get your name shitlisted as a selfish dick by everyone you meet on the way to 60, good luck with your groups.
---
Doesn't matter much what we think. Matters what your server thinks. Ultimately you'll kick yourself later if you can't find groups due to this. 
---
P.S. I'm not for or against what you did. Just pointing out that reputation matters. There is no name changing that can be done and until server transfers are implemented you are responsible for your actions and reputation on the server.
---
I need a man who understand my half tauren baby come first
---
...I feel attacked
---
Your history hit me on the feels. Welcome home!.
---
Oops, that was why. It works now, thank you.
---
You're delusional if you think that. If anything, Classic is gonna help retail because Blizzard might learn what aspect of the game players like. And don't forget that Classic is a finite game, so it's gonna die a slow natural death in a few years no matter what state retail is in.
---
Inflation caused by leveling makes the 30s far more useful to you when you first bought it.
---
Stick with paladin if you like it. Sure, you are gonna be spamming flash of light but sometimes that doesn't give you the amount of healing required for the incoming damage. Even though you are only spamming 1 spell mainly, you're gonna need to use holy light when incoming damage is high, manage your mana, and keep buffs up so it is more interactive than you think.
---
No it's just leveling gear. If it's an upgrade it's fair game
---
you probably will be, it might be close but no big deal, not everyone will for sure
---
anyone who hits 60 and has gold for the epic mount/riding right now is cheating (gold spammers are all over already, but they're probably just account thieves and not an actual business)
---
Did you ever figure this one out, OP?
---
As a new player who did Wailing Caverns for the first time today I did this on accident. I’ve learned I have to /Roll for it
---
happy to help :-) good hunting
---
Congrats! I spent a whole summer farming for one of these back in BC, and when friends have been asking me which part of classic I'm looking forward to to most and I tell them refarming all the whelplings they don't see the appeal. 
---
I like you OP. You're one of the ones who gets the appeal
---

Look man I’m sorry but I’ve been working on collecting those fungal spores for three fucking days okay I need this

It does, nice one ;)
---
Thanks for the full confirmation, this kind of stuff is what people need to see.
---
Not a world first but sure.
---
Your pointless provocation doesn't work. Just in case you haven't noticed.
---
&gt;I think they at least need a global chat channel per dungeon
---
I think they already do, or at least Deadmines apparently has a general channel if you get thru the instance portal.
---
Consider it this way: The money you use by killing someone with an Iron Grenade outweighs the time (thus, money) you waste by running back to your corpse.
---
Imagine this xD
---
Edward is that you?

So, were not gonna talk about "Skinpistol"?

Never had a Queue on Sulfuras.

---
I have this question I can't find a definite answer to, can you guys help?
---
I want to roll a warrior  and I want it to be a dwarf but I am afraid that I am crippling myself in the endgame. Many people say that human racial is OP and that dwarf warrior is not as viable esp in pve. I read that human is going to deal 5% more damage, which is a lot. Yet now I see that the &lt;APES&gt; guild rolled dwarf warriors and it didn't stop them at being world first. 
---
So, how much am I crippling myself by going dwarf warrior instead of human?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
That's not a global channel, that's just the general chat for that zone. If they expanded that to everyone of the appropriate level, i think that would be a good compromise
---
I am the Rogue that patiently waits stealthed near the chest...
---
Do you really rest your monitor on a speaker like that?
---
Classic has a much more satisfying new player experience, so I'd recommend it for someone new. Retail suffers from not caring at all about anything that isn't max level, and is going to be a lot more confusing with a thousand different ancient systems and currencies bolted on that are often not even relevant anymore.

Mate, what font do you use and what did you do so the chat window don't apear transparent after hovering ? I'm searching for the options for that for like 1h ;(
---
It is known.
---
Fucking mafia man
---
Disagree on renew, otherwise pretty neat. Note, renew does seem efficient as hell for me, usually at the end of cast of heal to not disturb 5 sec rule.
---
I would not recommend new healers to stay away from Hots honestly, I can do some instances by keeping renew on tanl and wanding for spirit tap with occasional heal and there, leaving me with time and mana to help out with holy fire and other damage.
---
It's either your internet or your computer that is the problem here. Because the game does not kick you from the queue, and I have spent days in queue in total.
---
Onebag, Weakauras, Auctioneer, Dominos, and a few others I can't remember. 
---
If you have coding experience I definitely recommend weakauras. Even if you don't you can copy some settings from the internet.
---
Hope you like it! Afternoon/Evening PST is the worst, queues have been up to an hour or two but seem to be getting better. I haven't waited in a queue longer than 15 minutes in the last two or three days, but I've been doing my best to log on before the queue's get real bad (Even if I'm not ready to play yet I'll log in via remote desktop an hour or two ahead of time).
---
Can confirm
---
Have spent the same time trying to reconnect to servers that my American friends spent sitting in a queue for theirs
---
Same here brother
---
Aw this is a sweet woosh. You put a lovely detailed effort into helping him understand, you seem nice. Have a lovely day
---
This is awful.  Sometimes I tank for instances because people struggle to find tanks, but I tell them I'm rolling as DPS
---
Can the mods tell me why this wasn't "low effort meme" like all the other ones being deleted?
---
Ouch, seems like chopping up the baby after throwing it out with the bath water! I haven't even noticed the layering tbh... mind if I ask why it's so bad you'd deprive yourself of the most exciting period of classic wow? Genuinely curious how this became that big of an issue for someone?
---
Come play classic! I'm totally new as well. To MMORPGs and this game. Never got the chance to play back when.
---
Wait, dual vs horde? Not a pvp realm?
---
15 hours sounds worth it but man I won't be able to handle that disappointment if it doesn't drop!

I think it's a bit scaly and firespitty for a bird.

I had a long-term substitute teacher in highschool who was filling in for his sister while she was on maternity leave. After a short time of him teaching I caught on that he played wow and his character names always had Raff in it. Well sure enough my buddy is sitting next to me in a battleground one night and gets into some serious 1v1 battle with none other than my teacher’s tauren warrior. I knew it was him right away, and confirmed it the next day in class. Chances of us being in same battlegroup and noticing him in a battleground were so crazy low, but it happened. He never wanted to talk about wow in class, but after that he couldnt help himself. I got an A lol
---
your anecdote really convinced me I was wrong! Thank you!
---
Use curse of agony too. I fear a lot. You should be able to kill things crazy easy. 
---
After the three dots I shoot a shadowbolt, then maybe fear or wand depending on mobs life.
---
Tanks are the easiest role to find a group for. Usually warrior tanks, since theyre undoubtedly the best tanks in classic, nothing compares. If you're a decent tank, youll be fine when it comes to lfg
---
WHY CAN'T I GET SOME FUCKING DECENT TEAMMATES FOR ZF FARM ?
---
Look at that cheeky bugger with their 1-1000 /roll, I like how karma immediately bitch slapped them!
---
I lold xD
---
I like skinning very much. It helps clean up the environment from decaying corpses. I don't want flowers and lush greenery growing in the Barrens.
---
To be fairrrrrr
---
My succubus is named Hestai, which is really just Hentai with a typo.
---
Nobody wants to watch some random dipshit on stream in an ocean of streaming dipshits.
---
Because googling it is the same amount of effort?
---
Classic has me ADDICTED again to the game...
---
no ret critadin?
---
Don't you think it's ridiculous you gotta run the same dungeon in like 18 different difficulties?
---
Tanks and healers are always needed.
---
As both a healer and a tank, I really appreciate this.
---
When can we expect you to get bored and go back to retail with your ilk?
---
'who are you?'  
---
'I'm you, but gayer.'
---
That TF2 class selection music though
---
I got one off my second mob in westfall on my paladin.  Asked if any rogues wanted it, not realizing it was BoP.
---
See this is what was fun about the game. This is mostly gone now but it's looking like it may be back in classic.
---
Bro, forgot about these. Soooo jealous, you got your first classic wow shiny!
---
no small wonder 1 and 2 are so close together
---
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck  
---
youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
---
From what I've read, immolate has a really bad mana-damage efficiency ratio. My rotation is usually send in void, corruption, curse of agony, wand or shadowbolt when I have mana to spare.
---
Make sure you bought the rank 2 torment from the demon trainer for your void.
---
Those red enemy names are like bloodshot eyes waiting in the fog.
---
Slow speed mainhand. Fast offhand.
---
First I stopped setting process priority and I got some condensed air to clean dust from my fans, I recommend watching a YouTube video on how to do this before trying yourselves guys but it helped a lot 😀
---
Can you do both? Or just one, andcan shadow do healing?
---
I got my green wind serpent yesterday and am loving it. I hated them back in vanilla but they are definitely a unique species.
---
exactly
---
Some people would rather be right than happy.
---
I've already done that. Got 2 options for mainhand now.
---
With classic's user base being mostly 30ish+ now, there's heaps of us playing just an hour or so a day. I've been unintentionally playing with the same lvl 12s for like 3 days now. And remember, anything you enjoy doing is never a waste of time!
---
My parents used to say they couldn't take me anywhere nice.
---
What are other classes requiring more Skill ?
---
no you are not "supposed" to do shit other than mine your node
---
What class?
---
Jokes on OP, he thinks anything besides food and grays drops in chests 😂
---
Are kids these days using the word 'fuck' in this way. 'Dude fuck that video'? In my day that meant the video sucks and offended me.
---
I always leave the worst thing in it so people who loot the chest after me have a funny surprise
---
Thank you 😊
---
Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
---
This almost exactly. Just because this game has rereleased doesn't mean that any old or new players will be less douchey than they are in retail or other games. I've watched so many people stand idly by just because they didn't want to help me or others out when respawns get a little nuts. 
---
Encountered plenty of people that refuse invites on quests because "solo xp" when the spawns are already low as it is. Watched rogues steal caster daggers because of higher dps.
---
I've always been the type to try and help if I can. Anyone I find that's low or about to die I help kill their mob and give them a hearthstone. No point in expecting anything in return. My only hope is that they will pass it forward.
---
Oh jesus, I only knew it from the meme. I had no idea about its dark origins.
---
Tbh as long as you are properly geared those stats are minimalistic and should not be keeping you from playing what you want. I’ve seen undead rogues do more dps over an orc so you should be fine in the long run. Those little bits might improve damage but if you want to play a dwarf it’s definitely okay to do so.
---
GZ on 60!
---
When is phase 2?
---
I have bad news
---
Just raidmaxx bro
---
I'll go you one better and pick a fight with you over the drama you started on the first drama.
---
Me and my friends takled it yesterday too.
---
Best moment was when, in a pack of 4, a mob resisted Sap and they all turned to the rogue and killed him. We laughed so hard.
---
Today I gathered all quests for Wailing Caverns MD we should do It tomorrow night.
---
I would love to see that.
---
Bind your mount to shift + scroll wheel down.
---
Streamers are trash people. Complaining they want a classic wow experience for years and then abuse these bugs 😂. Trash ppl
---
Blizzard will likely introduce server transfers later on, but who knows really. 
---
I don't get why you wouldn't have just played on a medium - high server to begin with. I can't fathom waiting that long in queue.
---
Haha nah sorry
---
oooohhh so close
---
tfw you try to be smarter than the guy smarter than you
---
Happened to me while I was clearing a mob next to it as a rogue.  Another rogue popped out of stealth and started to ninja as soon as I engaged.  Vanished, mob engaged him, and I ninja’d it back as soon as the mob was near death.
---
Feels good.
---
you know it's like, necessary right now?
---
So many lives lost when the healer installs this classic...
---
And maybe a few herbs!
---
Dunno man
---
This is peak Yiga clan
---
Look at Mr rich guy here who can buy all his spells.
---
While it may be convenient, it kills the community. The community is built on mutual suffering. We all have to run, no one gets a shortcut. Just suffer with us bro it makes us closer.
---
Posts about it.
---
Not sure they just look crazy haha I’ll consider it in the future though
---
DPS= Damage per second and not damage range right?
---
My 49.1 DPS sword has much faster swing speed than 47 DPS one.
---
Same i never saw the loot duel thing, basically it picks a random level and everyone shoots one ball, and the one with the most points wins the loot, gotta have master loot tho
---
I prefer /smile.
---
It leaves them wondering...is he just being nice?  Or is he smiling because he's about to kill me?
---
10/10 trolling I would have laughed if I got this right after the initial sting of the truth wore off
---
Hi SteezyWilkos, thanks for the tips. I don't have a hard time finding people and behave. I don't look for instance buddies, i'm looking for someone to socialeising in-game with. 
---
//Flyinghobbit
---
definitely the asshole.
---
Mostly just vendoring at least the lower level skins, I've sold some hides and medium/heavy leather on the AH but it doesn't go for that much over vendor. Its certainly not worth going out of your way to go to an AH for the leather, and probably not worth the postage to a bank alt either tbh.
---
My sense so far is that skinning is a quantity over quality thing, I've gotten specific herbs that sell for a fair bit but you only get a few at a time, with skinning there's certain quests/farm spots where you'll come out with like 3 or 4 full stacks of leather which is worth a pretty penny even straight to the vendor.
---
Retail has plenty of aoe grinding and absolutely no need to ever interact with anybody else.
---
I paid for BfA but never wound up playing it because of IRL stuff
---
Now I'm playing classic and REALLY fucking enjoying myself and I'd like to be able to reach 60 while MC is still actual and I am a slow fucking leveler
---
so tl;dr are the BfA leveling zones good enough to go through it at least once or should I stick to retail
---
This dad has been playing with a seven month old on my lap over half the time and serving a three year old. It definitely adds its own challenge, and I think it might make me regret my choice to roll RP PvP with the amount of AFK I've found myself doing.
---
You can't loot players in WoW, at least not in this phase.
---
I wanted to tank, and god I'm tired of healers of dos pulling monsters and not waiting for me to make a bit of thread. Then they wipe and is my fault. Like what the hell.
---
Any recommendations for addons at lower levels?
---
I'm totally new to WoW in general and am currently under level 10. Just curious if there are some addons out there that make things a bit smoother (UI? Map stuff? Quest tracking? Idk). Really having a lot of fun so far
---
/use Holy Light(Rank 1)
---
That should cast rank 1 of HL. Make sure there is no space between the last letter of the spell's name and the first (.
---
Ty!
---
nope, just want to be able to use a mouseover macro with a lower rank spell than the highest I currently have
---
Dreadmist! Lots of noedic guilds:) horde tho
---
Mate any Tom dick and Harry can get a masters today. It's really not impressice at all.
---
tried this now i cant move frame at all
---
well if you attack a guard it will post "area is under attack in local/world defense" but not for player kills no
---
Don't self promote and spam the fucking chat if you  don't want to be muted.
---
It'll be a lot better when DME comes out. Those lashers can take you pretty close to 60 from 52.
---
Every Ascendants player I've ran into has been an immature teenager.
---
There are 2 kind of people in wow. Those who ran straight in to stitches when autorunning, and liars.
---
Tailoring is fun for making your own gear (Making bags is a bonus). Also enchanting goes well with tailoring since you can disenchant the greens you make.
---
I was an Undead Mage for vanilla through WOTLK and then I left. Jumping back in as a Warlock and the class quests are so awesome. There’s actual exploration, social interactions, yeah less abilities but WAY more important deductions then retail with builds, and the best thing: Class Fantasy and immersion.
---
I AM a Warlock, I have to earn my spells, and eventually earn my fluff spells like Doom Ritual or inferno where I summon an infernal. Way less useful but FUN. 
---
I remember my Mage being the same way, earning the last Conjure water and Polymorph upgrade to different animals. I felt like a mage, a supreme wielder of the arcane arts that could end a life every 3min...yes I was a POM AP Pyroblast mage...and I loved it.
---
Found the ninja-looter.
---
Yea for a healer druid dps is pretty insane. We are able to clear dungeons so much quicker having the druid in cat for easy pulls.
---
The problem lies in the tank pulling a few too many to hold aggro and damage is split between 3 people.  Then after everyone is about 40% health the tank grabs more.  There are good tanks, average tanks, and tanks that never use defensive stance
---
Org to TB zep was added in Wotlk...?
---
Either you say herb wrong in your head (it's pronounced 'erb') or you don't realize that the you're actually supposed to use 'an' before any words that *sound* like they start with a vowel, not just words that literally start with a vowel.
---
yeah damage range doesn't matter
---
Me too, with a view of the ruins of Lorderon
---
Keep your attitude to handle things in life .. good one :)
---
Tons
---
The funniest thing is that is EU who destroyed them.
---
JkoerD is EU player and APES (guild who killed rag and ony)  are EU.
---
We can safely say that Europe &gt; World in Classic WoW.
---
anyone would hate this experience. You were basically rushed through a dungeon by pros without any time to take in your surroundings or understand the challenges.
---
I promise going in there with a group of similarly new, patient players who like to communicate is a wonderful experience. It's a blast going over strategies for each pull, seeing the blue drops that you have earned, chit chatting in between, following tank/healer instructions, occasionally dying and getting subsequently better, etc.
---
Not arguing or anything, just like to further my understanding of linguistics.  Why wouldn't it be "a herb node"?  From my understanding an is generally reserved for words starting with vouls.
---
They will have to add new content, either that’s the same content that was released in the past or totally new content exclusively for wow classic. If they don’t people will stop playing and the game will die.  Not many people will continue playing if they are max lvl and have completed all of the dungeons/raids many times, and finished all quests and skills.
---
To be fair, some of them could be new players, it's a bit harsh to put those on a shitlist (though the vast majority obviously have played for some time, and those are complete dicks).
---
Oh come off it, that isn’t what I said. If you like PvP then do it the entire time. If you hide in instances while levelling and don’t go out to contested areas until you’re more geared than most other people then you don’t like world PvP, you like ganking people.
---
Is Arms a good spec for that while leveling?
---
depends how busy your server is
---
Which of the 3 are better? I understand that the talents allow for bonuses with the item choice. Axe seems best because of 5% crit but a part of me wants the mace for the bash chance. Bash can sometimes come in handy killing mobs but so is crit. IDC about looks, just want beat value. 
---
I’m leaning more to the mace but this q has been on my mind for days.
---
Zepqua - Imp
---
Konmon - VW
---
Carrriana - Succubus
---
by 2025 they can release this type of design? lmao
---
But do you play everyday all day or do you have to go to work/school and stuff? Seriously people have already taken down molten core.
---
gave me some weird error message with a buncha letters like: You have been disconnected World of Warcraft XDR79X etc sigh.
---
I actually do that as well.  
---
I just turn Ground Clutter down though.
---
But really, do what you think is fun. Don't choose a profession because you want to earn the most money or min/max your performance.
---
19s ea
---
You get it from your class trainer usually. If you are higher now you need to look for it since grey quests don't appear as exclamation marks.
---
[This is the one I did](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1818/speak-with-dillinger) but there are three different ones that you can do in every starter area.
---
Herb makes a vowel sound so you can use "an." Maybe practice sounding out your letters next time like your Kindergarten teacher taught you. Nice try though.
---
This is the same thing you can do in retail, its just people think you can't, for some reason.
---
I got tickled the other day by a higher level choosing not to gank me.

Called sarcasm my dude. All good if it’s not how you would have responded.
---
If i see someone fighting next to/on a chest/mine/herb ill help them kill whatever it is and see if they take the thing. Im not here to be an asshole, but if they walk away i get what i would have waited for anyway
---
I had a quest on darkshore where you’re supposed to escort this miner. Anyways, it’s a first come first serve kinda quest that can keep you waiting for 6 mins each run.   
---
There were like 6 people crowded around the spot the quest had to appear, and I ran in, last, yoinked the quest and spammed /fart as the quest commenced.   
---
Truly my best classic wow experience.
---
Sorry to hear that, I hope it gets better for ya. Crossleg is my favorite seating position by far lol
---
Being this stupid must hurt.
---
Asbad as the scum who doesnt loot all of it, preventing a new chest from respawning
---
I got my first BoE epic from a chest in the blasted lands near the end of Vanilla.
---
If you dont have bfa, and just subbed, it can take up to 72 hours to clear starter account status.
---
I went with tailoring and mining while Im leveling then I'll use the mining materials to level engineering and drop one of the two when I hit 60.
---
liar
---
just loot it all so it respawns
---
So the reason Blizzard suggested to switch to lower pop realm is to alleviate queue times. However Blizzard has also said that they would rather inconvenience people temporarily with high queues than to have too many realms that will be dead 6 months from now because realm mergers are too resource exhaustive. So what are you going to do in 6 months when your realm with no queue now has no people? Blizzard has the ability to increase realm size as we have seen and maintain server stability(in my experience) so can they just increase realm size again?  Where is their limit?
---
The faces ( male orcs, female human and gnomes I'm looking at you ) are ugly tho, the rest is really great for a 2004 ( 2006 for classic I guess)  game
---
Retail mentality. Just let the group die till they learn their lesson
---
Prot paladin is perfectly fine for 5man dungeons. It'll be slow going when you're solo leveling though.
---
For raiding, I wouldn't get your hopes up. You are extremely, extremely unlikely to find the mythical classic WoW raid guild that will subject themselves to wasting countless man-hours and expensive consumables due to wipes caused by using a paladin tank instead of a warrior. There's flex room for meme dps specs to be carried, but tanking is so critical to the success of the raid that using a paladin is a huge and noticeable blow to the group. It may be possible but you would be subjecting 39 other people to a lot of frustration multiple times a week.
---
wouldn't they have tried a private server to practice?
---
I'm not gonna quit until I can take down stormwind by myself
---
Did that:P
---
Well, you are wrong.  I literally watched moo\_uk's stream a couple hours ago while he was farming mining nodes.  He just cleared them all, got a party invite that layer hopped him and poof: fresh nodes.  Rinse and repeat.
---
İ believe hes the og maker of the old icons, game automatically uses it when it doesnt know which icon to pick.
---
Yes agree 100%!! I’m level 17 now questing in the zombie forest and the questing is better. Except I miss the chat in barrens that stuff was hilarious.
---
Yes it is...
---
Dude it doesn't matter at all. People just like arguing online.
---
There's that quest in the barrens where you have to blow a horn and a beast appears and you kill him. Had someone steal my tag so I was left with no horn and no drop from the beast. To be fair though I hung around and stole the next guy's tag so I could finish the quest.
---
Awesome thanks for the heads up.
---
The +1 to daggers is outweighed but the states themselves. He won’t find a better upgrade for a while. And again this is vanilla. There isn’t a +5% to stats for wearing your classes main armor type. The fact that you are being ignorant to what strength and agility can do for any melee class tell me you play retail and started someone after cata. Just because there’s a + 1 to daggers doesn’t make it rogue. Warriors can use daggers and duel wield them. 
---
The stat “armor” is to low at low levels to take in to account. You want to kill your target as fast as you can while taking as few hits. 
---
Having high armor and low stats doesn’t get that done. Look up end game gear for warriors and paladins they wear some leather pieces.
---
It should be normal after 1 day.  Might be a bug left over from old Vanilla code or it's intentional to prevent spamming.
---
Ugh, give the chinese gold farmers a week or two and you will be able to spend as much as you want.
---
Was mining in Durotar.  Thankfully got the first click on a node but someone came up and nabbed the rest.  After I /sigh, I get asked if I'm gay and told to stop following him.  
---
I had carried his ass through fizzle just prior to this.
---
so druid or rogue for pvp?
---
100 years ago: "Son, I write to you hoping to find you well..."
---
Today: "Yo let's do a Deadmines run."
---
&gt; so druid or rogue for pve?
---
Does it require skill though ? Heard wow PvP is pretty braindead
---
They have been crunching layers. I've been abusing the living shit out of the feature to farm herbs. 
---
Give it time. Stop being a reactionary baby. They are obviously doing their best to accomodate as many players as possible.
---
Do you have ADHD by chance?
---
15 years of experience tells me otherwise.
---
I fucking loved the Hinterlands. Great area
---
As a healer, this is fucking amazing!!! I was running rage fire earlier with a warrior and a druid but the druid was the tank (the warrior sucked tbh and needed basically every drop so that should tell you about them as a player) and the warrior kept running in and pulling/building agro even though they were not the tank (I literally asked who was the primary tank and both said the druid). I just gave up healing them mid-fight after a bit and guess what the warrior died. I rez'd but the tank had almost died like twice because I had to spend so much mana healing the warrior (the rogue also was getting hit a bit much but nothing terrible). After telling the warrior to stop getting so much aggro and to let the tank initiate things (which the tank was also telling them) multiple times I just game upon them and this post covers a lot of the issues that I am seeing in new dungeon runners. 
---
By the way just to be clear I am also fairly new and I know I am not the best healer or anything like that and I am sure many people here could point out flaws I make as a healer but normally my flaws are throwing on power word: shield to often or using one rank to high of a heal sometimes because I am expecting more damage to go to the tank then actually does.
---
More like the other way around.
---
Not when he's claiming he's the first person to have done it, it's not. 
---
He's trying to claim he's the first person to have done it but has absolutely no proof at all that he's done it.
---
Well I know I've done it more than 4 times an hour, but even still black lotuses are on an hour respawn timer so being able to swap 4x an hour would be 4x the lotuses technically
---
That makes sense, and was something I was curious about. Do mining nodes regenerate all at once, or are they effectively several instances of the same node layered on themselves? Like if I only get two whacks out of a mining node, is that because it was recently spawned and hasn’t “grown” or is it just random?
---
Druid - is there a class that has more buttons than them?
---
Nah man, we going out swingin!
---
yea but whats the code
---
method stream.
---
the race to world first is something everyone added to it... because they've been doing MYTHIC world first races.
---
the fact that method don't even have 20 people there, and those guys aren't even in the main method group... kinda point out they did not have much interest for it.
---
You don’t take enough damage for rage regen to make sunder worth it at lower levels. 
---
You spend a lot of time with no rage.
---
Not going to lie.  I actually got a little choked up reading this.
---
Feral druid. Started tanking, got tired of dps that blow their load while the mob is still in transit to me
---
Molten Core is easier than Scarlet Monastery.
---
BWL is pretty complicated, but not hard.
---
The second half of AQ40 is medium hard and requires good gear and coordination.
---
Naxx requires so much preparation and execution, and literally thousands of gold in consumables to progress through.  It’s hard enough that people will wipe and the real difficulty is staying on task and farming the, let’s say, 3 Greater Shadow Protection Pots for each Loatheb attempt, per raid member.
---
The real challenge is that Vanilla is a marathon that takes probably two years to go from killing Ragnaros to killing Kel’Thuzad.  You can do mythic raids after a couple months of good RNG.

Yeah but people don’t know or care so they are going to be elitists for level 30 dungeons. I just /who druids to tank and more often than not they never get spammed and are more than willing to tank dungeons. People act like you need the best of the best for some reason.
---
It helps me out so much with actual leveling too. As a warrior I’m constantly low health after fights, so it’s good to have a dozen or two cooked food/fish to have. It only takes 10-20 minutes to get a decent amount of fish, most of which restores a fair amount of health uncooked. 
---
It’s good to just take short breaks in between mobs or quests to just fish for a little bit.
---
I'm so glad we got some notes about my Shaman Tank. Now If only we could get more notes on Hunter Tanks...
---
That’s a wonderful skill the warlock has, he deserves the praise, the praise goes to him and who summoned you and not some stone.
---
Just a pyon pyon pyon parady with a static loli picture.
---
Stamina and spirit?  That hat is excellent.
---
I’d play the shit out of TBC and WOTLK or a Classic+, but xpacs after that I’d rather they just start over again.
---
Awesome, do Elites not stop following you after x distance like other mobs?
---
if you are in kurinaxx is that guild open
---
It also depends which way they are facing. Mobs have a cone field of view in front of them, rogues will notice this right away when stealthing.
---
I don't get who this is supposed to be funny to. Pretty boring game if everyone went Horde.
---
This is me too 😁
---
They already added layering to help alleviate some server pressure. There isn’t much more they can do other than add more servers, but players don’t want to play on low pop servers since they fear they will die. So we’re stuck with these super high population ones.  
---
They’ve actually done a lot and anticipated this and 5k queue is pretty reasonable considering the amount playing right now...  
---
I’d say either play at nights, Remote Desktop, or just wait a bit many will soon stop after a month or two the queue will drop.
---
That sucks. Your server choice that is.
---
I would rather spend however much time it takes to lvl 10 different alts through classic then send 1 more toon through the tedium that is BFA leveling zones imo
---
yesterday and today were expected to be the highest queue days due to the holiday. 
---
queues will likely go down starting tomorrow.
---
Hey guys can someone tell me some usefulls addons which works for classic? I already have auctioneer, Questie, allyroute, and Recount.  
---
I edited my comment to include a (probably working?) complete mouseover macro, requiring only one button on your action bar.
---
The queue times are what held a lot of people back from leveling. I could only play for about 4 hours total last week and was level 5 or so. No lifed it this weekend and hit 27.
---
It all depends on how much free time you have, and how many others are leveling in your area.
---
    /tar Mob Name
---
    /script if UnitName("target") and not UnitIsDead("target") and not GetRaidTargetIndex("target") then SetRaidTargetIcon("target",1); end
---
    /cleartarget [dead]
---
This variation of the macro will put a raid marker on the mob, helpful if he's behind a wall or something. On retail, you can even configure your minimap to show your target.
---
You don’t have to, you can be casual like classic and just run in the base difficulty. But it’s great that you have the option to challenge yourself with hard modes if you want to be hardcore.
---
303 minutes and going UP.
---
Does anyone know if there are any working threat meter addons?
---
I mean, for most greens you should be able to get around double the vendor price.
---
on a 20 silver green that's not bad at all, but I wouldn't sit around town advertising them, just throw them up on the AH and get back out there.
---
So if you lose a race it’s no longer a race? Lmao so much salt.
---
Transmog killed the feeling that the gear you wore mattered. When you see a high level dude in fucking baller raid gear that means something. When everyone can transmog into wacky shit those encounters become less meaningful and more nonexistant.
---
Pet battles are...I mean I like them but I'm sure people here have very valid arguments against them.

Thank you so much!

Because... it is true? Not... sure how else I'm suppose to prove it. The first week at 1pm queues were 3-4k. Now they are 8k. Not sure how any more true.... a person could make that?

Can you confirm what server you’re on?

invites from people in other layers

I guess it depends on how you pronounce it. It's based on the vowel sound and not the vowel itself. Many people pronounce it as "erb" with a silent H

Thanks... Ya I queued up like 2 1/2 hours ago; 11 minutes for me!! Lol
---
Holy shit, I have been bitching about this for days.  Happens \*constantly\*.   I'm literally standing on the chest, killing a mob and person just runs up and opens it, or opens the quest item, node, etc and then just skips away while I'm fighting the mobs that were around it.  Shit bags.

It's still live.
---
Same, I'd love to have a tbc version but even wotlk and higher I'm not a huge fan.
---
This is why i prefer TukUi over ElvUi. It's great out of the box and requires next to no setup to get things where i want them.
---
Bash is ok, but the 5% crit from axes really helps.  As a warrior you can easily die after a string of misses and dodges so you need to really make every hit count.  Most people agree axe is best for leveling, followed by sword.  The mace does have the lowest attack speed I believe which you would generally prefer, but the weapon talent isnt that great for leveling.
---
That's why I picked a PVE server
---
So if I own BFA do I get the boost?
---
The ability scripts are not on the client.
---
Shockadin was awesome
---
I named a guy Masterbeta and i got to like level 11 and they made me change so i switched over to alliance and that's when i found my dwarf rogue and fell in love with the game back in vanilla.
---
i love some of the names people come up with, from the obvious names like "bignuts' call me a child but that's fucking hilarious to me, to the subtle jokey ones or puns.
---
Bloodsail buccaneers
---
I did this a few times because I didn't remember how nodes work in Classic. Or rather, I did it once.
---
Though sometimes you end up walking to a node at the same time as someone else, and honestly, I think people just need to share in that case.
---
always axe, slowest speed so it hits the hardest
---
I am leveling a warrior. I read everywhere that two handed weapons are what you should go for. But I like one hand wep and shield. I have specced fury. Does shield have no other function than armor when in battlestance? I am level 14.

I had a run in WC with two druids and a warlock.  My druid was 19, and the other druid didn't have reagents.  We got through a wipe before the question of rezzes came up.

---
layering was necessary for launch because of how many people were in teh same areas. it won't be as necessary later and then it can be fixed/removed/adjusted/whatever
---
Yes and no. Many dps meters have one built into it, but require the group to have the same on. No threat api so no pure threat meters
---
You dont understand the scenario here.
---
Player A in in layer 1
---
Player B is in layer 2
---
Player C, D, E, ........ is in layer 3
---
Player B spots a hostile group or a solo player.  Player A, B, C, D, .......... are on eachothers friends list or something.
---
Player B tells A, C, D, E, ......... to go to a specific location and then player B invites the other players.  All the sudden mages, priests, paladins, locks, warriors pop into layer 2 in a "stealthed" manner and kills the group or solo player.  Classes WITHOUT a stealth ability should NOT have one via the layer mechanic.  Blizzard needs to remove this cancer.
---
happened sometimes too, a lot of ppl complaining about this problem,
---
Well flavor of the month, won't last
---
I don't see them restarting it. Would essentially make it like a seasonal thing. I could see either very slowly moving through xpacs or it just becoming its own self sustained game.
---
Thats fucking platinum right there.
---
still, it is a in game mechanic that makes so that mining nodes are shareable, different from chests and herbs...
---
you are a godsend!! if i had gold i would definitely give it to you
---
Download weak auras 2 and go to wago, there's a popular weak aura on the nameplate debuffs. It's exactly what you're asking for and works amazingly well
---
Warrior life is hard. Very thankful for people like you &lt;3
---
It's one of the reasons I swapped from Mage to Shaman, getting a clutch heal or randomly rezzing someone feels good.
---
I don't know why people are critical of either, Blizzard is still getting your money whether you play one or the other.
---
As long as you stay close and attack them every x seconds you can kite forever.
---
Yeah that's me basically :D
---
But it's pretty much impossible to get a dungeon run as an actual DPS warrior and you're forced to tank. However, the first few dungeons have been so easy that I haven't managed to wipe my groups with my subpar tanking skills :D 
---
The one thing I'm truly clueless about is how am I supposed to keep aggro when a mage basically casts one spell on a mob and it instantly loses its interests in me. A friend of mine suggested spamming Demoralizing Shout because I won't be able to hold aggro with my low damage but that doesn't seem to work either. I try my best and I have definitely gotten better at tanking but it just seems impossible to me right now to be able to hold aggro all the time with every mob.
---
LOL THE VIDEO EDITING GOT ME.
---
It won’t. There ya go!
---
I've been doing something since vanilla that I will continue to do in Classic.
---
When I need to catch a boat/zep, I will pan the camera down so I can't see if the boat/zep is there. That way I don't know if I've just missed it or if it was never there.
---
Can't be disappointed if you can't see the disappointment
---
Please help... I haven't started this and worry posts like this are going to be me in a couple weeks and why I quit
---
No, they only stop following if you run away without attacking. I just spammed rank 1 Frostbolt on him which is 1 sec cast time with 5/5 improved Frostbolt
---
Both are correct. Australians would pronounce the "h" meaning it would be "a herb". If you say "erb" then "an" is the norm.
---

My favorite thing to do is sit in Goldshire as a low-level Priest and just Fortitude everyone that walks through. Haven't even gotten back to leveling, just did that for hours and chatted. Good experience, worth the $15.

There are different levels for professions that require you to get them from other cities. Some recipes are going to be BOP also. Not sure about level req though.
---
???? I see wow as a place where everybody can be (and is!) equal. Like I said, what you are in real life doesn't matter in Azeroth.   You are a  friend or an enemy (on PVP server) in the game world.    Details about your personal life you can reserve for your IRL friends and / or close guildies.
---
That's not bigotry , that's the opposite! Everybody is equal!

I’m happy with my mini diablo
---
I have a full time job and I've had to play around that, not to mention a fiance, gym and drinks with friends. I've managed to hit level 33 after about 1 day 20 hours played.
---
I don't know how I managed to squeeze that much WOW into almost a week
---
It takes extremely long to level to 60, for end game gear and post 60 content, it's natural to want to pick the better options, and not just gimp yourself. Obviously, play whatever you want if it's fun. But a clear aspect of fun is being good/having a goood time at different areas and some classes suck at this. E.g. warriors the best tank, other tanks don't compare end game for raiding and whatnot. 
---
The classic balance is really bad, undoubtedly. Hyper balance wasn't a thing back in the day, as it is now in retail.
---
Personally,  alch/herb on a druid is amazeballs. I have strong, agi, int pots 24/7. Slows lvling a bit getting herbs but more than worth it imo
---
I've always thought friendly fire should be an option for this kind of thing.
---
I think he's saying, in general, people can have fun their own way and while in this situation the way you told them to have fun is actually their way, but others may enjoy the race to the end rather than taking their time.
---
1. Low rank fireball is only used to on stealthies to keep them from stealthing
---
2. Scorch is useless as frost, your time would be better spent downranking a frostbolt if you had to do a quicker cast
---
4. Adding fire blast to a raid boss rotation is a dps loss, in pvp it’s great for when you’re moving or need to finish someone off
---
Rogue super powers, honestly. Stealth farm SM GY chests. Best of luck, my friend.
---
Snitches wants to play
---
How courageous of them
---
as if running that long stretch between Duskshire and Raven's Hill wasn't tedious enough, there's Stitches on noob patrol making sure autorun is obsolete.
---
Before a raid you will be asked to join discord/team speak or any kind of programme which allows communication, then before each boss the guild leader or somebody trusted in the guild will explain the tactics and then ask if everybody understands, you will be surprised at the amount of people who can’t follow simple instructions, those are the brain dead people, doesn’t take 15 years of playing the game to do that
---
yeah but you're killing stuff at a snails pace while staying at nearly full mana which is a huge waste of resources and time
---
with imp or succubus and draintanking you are constantly 100% hp and you actually burn targets down instead of tickling them to death 
---
but by all means keep using scuffed blueberry

Good on you for not being in a hurry.

Pretty sure Astranaar connects to Azshara, used that path often when going from Darnassus to kill Azuregos
---
Ugh
---
This guy gets it
---
seems like they stung.
---
&gt;...Only to say " CAN I GET THAT? " whenever an item drops.
---
huh? if an item drops and you need it, don't you ask that? That seems pretty normal. As for the rest of the post, who cares? the dude has a 30k+ fan base, do you think he could get the classic experience? He's not playing for himself, he's playing for others. He said himself that he plans on playing another character offstream and take it slow and appreciate it. He literally didn't owe anyone anything, how can he be disappointing?
---
&gt;Can anyone bring me up to speed like the pleb that I am, or in other words, explain like I'm five?
---
Basically it creates layers of the same section of the world, and players/npc's that 'exist' on those layers cannot interact with characters on another layer. You and your friend can be in the exact same location, but never see each other because you're on different layers. 
---
Basically this was implemented due to crowding, if you are farming raptors in the Barrens, you would expect hundreds of players to be farming those same raptors which would essentially make it impossible to complete any quest. So the world creates a layer that you exist on where not many other players are on, this allows you to farm raptors on that layer without hundreds of other characters also being there and causing all sorts of lag/issues/crowding.
---
This obviously sounds all positive because you can then farm without waiting 10 minutes for the next raptor to spawn, or without your screen being cluttered with newbies.
---
But there are major downsides, for instance places seem incredibly quiet, even massive areas like Ironforge/Orgrimmar only have a few people. Considering this is a MMORPG, it really kills the feel of the game because at times it's almost like you're alone.
---
If you party up with someone from a different layer, you join theirs and can see them, so that's the 'work-around'.
---
Yup. Level 40 catform druid stalking horde in STV. Most fun I've had in wow ever.
---
Eventually they're gonna organize a hunt because it's all I do. And I'm completely relentless.

Some of /r/wow mods are mods here, too. Which is really just one step for them to ruin this sub like they've done to /r/wow. Just one big art spam fest and people advertising to sell their work. /u/Ex_iledd is one of them.

---
Yes Trolls are the best pve warriors horde side, Tauren are close behind for cause of more health, and Orc is great, but better for pvp then pve. Undead is also good for pve and pvp but not the best at either, just so so. Troll is a solid choice for pve warrior.

They must have bumped up the drop rates for Zhevra hooves.  It took me 6 kills to get 4.  A guildie got 4 in 4.

AND HOW WILL MY OPINIONS ON RETAIL VS CLASSIC BE VALIDATED IF I DON'T POST ABOUT IT

Always buy everything you can.

10 silver may seem a lot now, but later on it's nothing, and those spells will help you get to higher levels faster.

---
it's ok to have different opinions.
---
This is hard to believe unless everyone in your raid was not playing correctly.
---
I started at 10k in queue and have now gone up tp 11.3k in about 2 hours.
---
The faster OH is more for proccing deadly, crippling.. etc while on top of that 1.5 is usually the sweet spot on proc limit of instant
---
Is there any official documentation to support that? I'm totally open to the possibility.
---
I'd just like some kind of evidence.
---
I don't know if i find that to be so unfortunate. But I would be really interested in the results of a poll about if blizzard should make a tbc server
---
Lol, I just watched a tiny bit of his reaction video to this post and I jumped to a point where he was saying "yeah, I begged for money, I changed my mind."
---
gratz mate, what is your /played?
---
you don't  have to but i always double check it
---
People have tried to do this to me and I just politely say something while they're opening it and they usually stop and say sorry.
---
I had like 30g at level 31 on my Mage. Never farmed anything, just leveled normally.
---
I DW from 20 to 60 so i always take wing blade and try to get the dagger off skum.
---
Cool thanks, but what about that pitty point? While leveling should I just stop using fireball at 10 too once I start making frost stuff better?
---
hype!
---
I tried to download it but it says it's the wrong version even though it's not.
---
Threat Plates did it for me.
---
I cannot figure out how to get it on the HUD but it shows up on the portrait (that I moved lower) and on the enemy/target name plate when name plates are visible.
---
Thank you for the suggestion and help!
---
(P.S to anyone who cannot move their portrait, disable Titan Classic, for some reason it won't allow you to move them if it is enabled)
---
an easy way to test this is to just put the piece with stats on then take it off and see if it changes the value
---
I am new to WoW, havent played any games before. I am a tailor and take linen bags to starting areas to give to players. I struggled through without knowing and I refuse to let others know that pain.
---
Washington
---
I think the higher levels would get less xp due to the gap between them and the NPCs.  It would likely be worthwhile to the lvl 20 regardless because he's getting sped through VC and collecting loot on the way.
---
yep :/
---
You as a user are the product. You are what they are selling to sponsors, advertisers, streaming personalities. Twitch doesn't create anything, they are just the middle man between you and some camera celebrity. If no one watches then the massive companies, Twitch, and streamers don't make any money. Kids are literally paying these people to destroy their own communities, culture, and promote toxicity through competition. It's a never ending high school where everyone's trying to copy off each others test. Watch your favorite streamer and copy his settings, they are the best because he is the best (or i think he is).
---
Someone was saying this is a myth and once one item is taken the chest will eventually despawn. I have not tested it myself.

Hah I made that run at a similar level. I made the mistake of trying to take a shortcut instead of following the road

Mage mage in aoe spec. Lock lock optimising hellfire. Holy priest.
---
Close eyes. Kill all. Rinse and repeat
---
Just start off with small corner pulls using eye of kilrog and priest shield. Control with the mages. Just learn to play it. Also madseason made a vid on it.
---
then show me how easy it is.
---
Do you have a link with any evidence to support that?
---
That's always been Distract's purpose. There is nothing better than lying in stealth near a cliff, waiting for an ally to run past on a horse, and distracting them right off. 
---
I always wonder what they think when that happens.
---
well i never played vanilla priests so i don't know how shadow is on that, i did like the string of attacks in retail shadow priests.  
---
that being said im always willing to learn
---
It's 3 months later. It's a problem
---
Where is that documented? Do you have a link?
---
Yes they removed all mobs in retail. You can now only play tetris in it.
---
God I love classic. It's harder then chess and theoretical physics combined yet faster then formula 1 and more immersive then Russian novels.

Also PWS is terribly mana inefficient.

Usually a comment about karma gets good karma...

So cool to hear that, why do you think it's an underplayed race/class combination?

Define worth. Not wiping because you grenade the healer who drew aggro in a dungeon? Interrupting the mind control on a boat? I could go on, but in the end it's up to you. I'm not making a ton of money throwing around nades, but I'm having a blast :-)
---
You are the only one saying anything of that sort.   You are making the claim that feral is a top dps most of the time and everyone else is just saying.   No it isn't.
---
Depends on the mat, many don't charge a deposit fee if you post them one at a time. Personally I look to charge 30% over vendors + auction house cut. I don't sweat the deposit because the vast majority of my listings sell. From 1-30 I've made about 1 gold an hour over 64hrs in game just in AH sales.
---
Thanks, I understand how the colors work but I'm specifically looking for a way to show quest levels next to their names in the quest pane.
---
I mean I guess, but can’t you say that about any end game content in any mmo? Isn’t that just the nature of an mmo?
---
So basically if I'm understanding you correctly, it's better for the game if people use the social aspect of it to create groups among who they meet, add to friend's list and group with as a way for them to establish a go to pool of peers to run content with.  Instead of relying on group finders which might delude the need to meet people and form relationships.
---
I think I see your point, I didn't think of it that way.  I'm still not convinced that it's detrimental to the game overall though because I would do both.  Quite frankly the way it is now, as a person who doesn't have a lot of free time to play, I'm really not planning on running a lot of groups for anything outside of my guild which I know ultimately will slow down my individual progression.  I really don't want to relive the old days where it would take 40 minutes to form a group only for that group to fall apart when the tank shows up and is unable to hold aggro or something like that.  Just from a sheer time commitment concentrate that's a deal breaker for me.
---
It took almost 2 hours to run through DM the other night and I thought to myself, yeah I don't think I'll be doing a whole lot of pugging this time around.  I would consider it though with the feature I mentioned because I can do other things while I wait for my group to form.  It's about being efficient with my game time for me but I do see your point.
---
I believe my “Certificate of Thievery” that I got at lvl 16 makes it legal for me to do this as a Rogue.
---
Every spells you use are frost. Let's not kid ourselves there.
---
In pvp it’s pretty fun. And might get you out of a situation or two while leveling. But other than that I wouldn’t
---
Not bad 😁
---
Unless the roar talents give more mitigation than the armor, id stick with armor. At end game the threat will be better most likely
---
Ok, your example is totally unrealistic.   In theory I get what you mean, but you  are very wrong if you think  that the price of scarce epics would go down like that.   The  market price of items like this right now is not based on supply and demand like in a mature economy.  NB: right now!     Right now it's based on the amount of gold in game.   Which is very limited.  Everybody is poor.  So no matter how few Staves of Jordan drop, the price can't go up to the 'real' market price, since nobody has that amount of coin.   The price is now: ' Whatever the richest streamer / powergamer can beg from his zerg  / loan from his guildies  and is willing to pay.    And that amount doesn't increase or decrease much if a few more Jordan's drop.  
---
In economic terms:   the market is inelastic now, and only will become elastic  when it matures and the amount of gold in game is  high enough that a normal price balance point  based on supply and demand can be established.
---
honestly, should just leave it in the game.  if people want to spam dungeons for hours on end, let 'em.  this just feels like bfa blizzard making things deliberately slower to keep people playing longer.
---
Gitting over it
---
I have 4: 12m, 7f, 5f and 2f. Lots of BS but lots of fun moments, too. I DM for my oldest kids, spent my queue time today running a short D&amp;D session with them. And now my son wants to try WoW, so that's cool.
---
Well that's a bummer as I'm a healer and that's exactly what I want it for &gt;.&lt; I want to try and time my fades before I pull aggro.
---
It's really annoying being called a fanboi with the implication that people who like BfA can't enjoy Classic.
---
That sounds more like gatekeeping and elitism all wrapped up in one package.
---
Oh no a stupid fuckface blocks me on reddit, how will I continue my life now. Stupid little cocksuckerd like you always give me a good laugh how you mention blocking. You do it and fuck off you autist retard
---
Threat api wasnt added until wotlk. The threat meter in classic requires you and othera in your party to have it installed so that they can 'talk' to each other and share threat numbers.
---
I tell you what though, I sure am enjoying the little things more this time around. 
---
Fishing for the heck of it. 
---
Little interactions with other players.
---
Leveling my crafting. 
---
Free enchants for strangers while we wait at the Zep.
---
Reading the lore. 
---
Running everywhere. 
---
Stopping at the safe spot on the side of the Gold Road so I can feed my kid.
---
It's all the same, but all different. The whole thing is pretty cool.

Quartz
---
You can't really do the whirlwind axe quest without a lot of help until level 38-39
---
This is your answer
---
I see you're getting the real classic experience! Just pay them back with interest. Crossroads is always a soft target.
---
This isn't even slightly applicable lol

42 lions in, finally got my 7th blood ughhhhh
---
See... If this was patch 1.0 there'd be no dire maul and therefore no debate
---
100% this. Slowly but surely pulled mobs away from the gnoll camp in Wetlands yesterday only to have some ball-gargling mage dunce skip up to it and loot it as I finished off the last of four mobs. 
---
“What gives?” I asked. 
---
He hopped up and down like a madman and went back to AoE farming mobs.
---
It's only a thing if they are not your faction.
---
If you're on horde join the realm, message me (Buxton)
---
I play retail and these things just do not happen cause social interaction is fucked up. First by the LFG and the LFR, second by flying mounts and third, which is a guess, it's people's mentality.

Quartz, its a neat addon that gives you a very adjustable casting bar, with buffs over it (can be turned off) and an auto attack swing counter.
---
?? Wotlk came out after
---
Rogue. Druid you are mostly raiding as a healer.
---
It's probably the most useful profession for levelling. Certainly more so than blacksmith/LW/tailoring etc. Grenades are very useful while questing and in dungeons and pvp'ing.
---
I dunno if people still do it, but it used to be super common, particularly with rare instance nodes.
---
Everyone rolls for the node, they all tap, but only the winner loots.
---
Hmmm not sure about cute, manly yes
---
Maitoz, the GM of APES, just said on stream that raid XP was used and was significant to their path to 60. They had several melee-heavy groups having issues with 5 mans that was alleviated in ZF with raid farming.
---
He also said BRD farming was not competitive enough, so theorycrafted 10-man LBRS and it worked and was great. That is when he instructed people to turn off their stream to keep the strat from Progress.
---
But good try.
---
Nah I actually checked ... it works.
---
On that page it says that the PPM changes were introduced in patch 3.1. So in classic perhaps there is no proc limit at all?
---
If you were trying to play a game and were unable to do so because you were being killed over and over again and it got to the point of "Unplayable" are you saying you would just keep trying?
---
Ok, now as you said "Many many people fucking "Hate" him" is that also the classic experience? you know being camped by "Many many" players? because from what I recall the one camping is generally end up being one player, maybe a group of five, not Thousands.
---
Seems like blind hatred from the masses.
---
Just to be clear, Streamers take the risk when they stream, and Streamsniping IS the only risk they take with their "jobs" never will I say that streamers should be able to make such easy money unopposed, but there is a limit to that before it becomes harassment.
---
Hardcore wow players don’t have any of that tbh. And many of them are young meaning they have 100% energy and can basically get away with 4 hours of sleep each night for weeks.
---
Yeah I know what it is haha. I think some of the addon are bugged. Iv has to reinstall a few. Going to reinstall this one
---
Well the thought behind it was they integrate these redeveloped versions into the main game. Like a choice for leveling. You can either have the post cata and current retail version which people do still like that fast leveling style. Or you have the ‘Classic play style’ where you play the entirety of the game as if it was 2004 and then play expansion to expansion as they were. I agree with you that classic and tbc could stand alone but they could make a lot of people happy this way while making a system in the main game that all players could benefit from, not just the current base playing classic.
---
He just doesn't loot usually

they really got low damage?

Those mages always sucking dickerino
---
I play 1-2 hours a day in a fairly inefficient manner. Slightly more on weekends, still just as inefficient
---
This is the advice I came here to give as well.
---
Your character has defensive skills, but the player needs tanking skills. Your raid marker keybinds are just as important as applying sunder armor.
---
Communication with your team is critical. Skulls and other raid markers are an effective way to quickly communicate the intended order of attacking a group of mobs.
---
When the dps are attacking the mobs you want, holding aggro becomes much easier.
---
mb I thought it was other way
---
Blizzard has already stated that Private Servers had the numbers wrong.  And that this is how the game officially was in Vanilla.
---
Yeah, the queues are crazy.
---
I live on east coast and my group joined a west coast server to help combat this. So when we're home from work, the west coast is still at work. Queues are short if at all.
---
They won't need to at higher levels because, again, tanks are just there to take as much heat as they can.
---
Mobs hit like wet noodles in classic - threat isn't a huge deal.

---
Nice tip!
---
Yeah that nodes not yours dawg lol
---
Huh, expert cooking book is in Ashenvale isn't it?
---
Yeah I had a party with a rogue, hunter and me (fire mage) in ZF earlier and the tank insisted on us aoeing down packs while he was using his 2h weapon. We didn't die but it took forever because I was running circles anytime I didn't have combustion up to burst the pack while the other dps were just doing single target anyway.
---
I think the tank still believes that aoeing everything is faster when it would've definitely been faster to just do them normally and not have to wait for a completely oom mage for 40 seconds after every pull while the rogue and hunter are twiddling their thumbs.
---
So I was killing quilboars outside of crossroads and this guy steals my mob from me. I laugh and take the chest right behind it and after he kills if he goes "well played" and continues killing the mobs. 
---
First one to the chest wins. First one to tag a mob wins. Welcome to classic.
---
So wool cloth seems to be about 1s each in the AH. I'm trying to level tailoring and it seems kinda expensive. Is the only other way to get it to skin sheep? I need 160 of them lol
---
Given that it happened in vanilla, that's pretty likely.

I mean, he's a fan of Asmon. It does not sound that difficult to get it
---
I’ve been asking the same thing. Let’s hope someone knows.
---
When I started macroing every druid spell I had so I could begin casting from any shape shift, I realized that macros are a slippery slope. Decided just to be okay with how some things are.
---
&lt;getting laid more over the course of your life 
---
checks out
---
Yeah, careful kiting is a decent way of peeling off guards that some rare spawns have. Or a large regular pack guarding a chest.
---
I've given up on tanking dungeons for the time being. I'm tired of dps going crazy on the mobs the second I pull (It's usually the mages using AOE spells).
---
Thanks a bunch! Going to check out madseason and reflect on it. This sounds straightforward enough to giveit a shot in a first place.
---
95% of the reason anyone picks a race is because of the model and animations. There's been huge nerfs/buffs to racials throughout WoW and the ratio of gnomes/dwarves/humans has always been fairly similar.

Flamelash, not totally full as Firemaw, Shazzrah or Golemagg but the pop is really high and the queues are not very long.

Nope i started on BC! Wotlk came out after

Sadly not little man. Just need to put little asshole's like you in your place sometimes.
---
That's dumb as fuck. You can tank mobs for a second until the tank grabs aggro and slowing down the run so you can act like a diva is such a dick move.
---
They meant or stick to classic.
---
Um what would you suck a dick for?
---
Boo hoo, some idiots made fun of me online. 
---
Mommy let me be angry at them!
---
Exactly right. I enjoy Classic for what it is. I also enjoy having a queue system for dungeons in Retail, and flying in old zones.

Trying to decide between mage, hunter, and paladin.
---
I usually like playing hybrids or healers/tankers, but I played druid a ton back in vanilla already and everyone I play with is already committed to alliance side, so no shaman. I'm not really interested in raids, just leveling and playing with friends.
---
Mage or hunter because I think it would be nice to play something that can actually kill at a decent speed for once. Paladin because I've always liked being support, but I never played paladin in vanilla and from what I've read it's incredibly passive to play as one which makes me wary.
---
How about you provide some documentation that supports that private servers had numbers correctly?
---
No official announcement has been made, however there are plenty of low to high pop servers you can reroll on.
---
Is that a dell xps or something?
---
How does it handle classic?
---
I've got my tower, but my laptop doesn't have a dedicated gpu and I haven't tried playing on it yet.
---
If you're enjoying it then keep doing what you're doing. AAP does break a lot and will probably slow you down vs a text guide if anything and cause frustration.
---
Isn’t fire preferred if the enemy is a caster? Slowing them down doesn’t do much. Assuming you’re less than level 30, fire is useful.

Retail doesnt scratch an itch anymore. We are all did casuals who do +10-15 keys in all 3 seasons, and do enjoy classic a lot (to the point of not feeling like logging in for weekly chores on main im retail). 
---
Just wanna change of pace to spice up solo grind we do.
---
That given if you are not being just sarcastic there.
---
you basically don't use fireball at all as frost spec. its not mana effecient even if it is higher dps, and the slow from frostbolt keeps mobs from hitting you. Value point in imp blizz is not so great. either put it all in or skip it entirely.
---
Based on Old School Runescape, I do think that people will be open to some changes over time, and later possible new content.
---
New content is released every 6 months in WoW (except for at the end of expansions). Not sure what point you’re trying to make?
---
Just woke up, your post was the first I read. It's going to be great day. Thanks for the lulz.
---
oh cool m8
---
Well thier rotation as a cat is extremely demanding to do the same damage as a rogue regulalry would.
---
I did just get promoted, does this count as a reward then? Haha
---
I have been buying mats that I see that are lower than “normal”. I have 3 bank alts though. I have been stashing all my herb and ore .
---
Both are available for classic as far as I'm aware.
---
They seem to work fine
---
Don't need code for Classic just a subscription.
---
Thank god. I hate all these kind of immature names.
---
It makes other players ask where you got it.

---
I’ve had to form my own groups in order to get leadership and power over DPS. Most groups have been mature and wonderful, but some individuals fail to listen to my warnings that I need to position and build threat properly. Even after multiple warnings I get messages such as “lol just use taunt” and I’m forced to kick them. I hate to be rude and waste their time, but it’s severely annoying and ruins the experience for everyone.
---
I dont either, i just saw what you dropped and handed it back to you.
---
Two reasons stick out:
---
- In Vanilla no one really knew the dungeons or their roles perfectly, so wipes were common and learning through multiple deaths was the norm. Nowadays you'll be doing SFK/WC/RFC/BFD etc with players that have raided Onyxia/BWL/Naxx++ and know almost every single detail about every single instance.  
---
- Private servers tune the difficulty to be much higher than the norm, there's no real difficulty in beating MC with 40 good players in vanilla, you can do it with people mostly in greens.
---
Yeah I know that's what they want us to do. However I'm level 40 and have a guild so that's not really an option for us haha
---
Just read the quest text it takes 20 seconds
---
can you explain what it means? you mean changing into a cat and then back and then back again every few seconds? this is what I understood from another forum
---
Tank or healer? 
---
Yeah, those are roles and not classes, but really, you'll have a DPS class already, so why not have something that can tank or heal? 
---
Maybe a druid, so you can do both (and DPS if you really want)?
---
Use whatever is your best weapon available. As you get higher lvl you will come across 2H weapons that will make you want to put down your shield. At 20 you can dual wield, and the difference in rage generation is crazy.
---
I left my lunch at home today so I *have* to go home to eat it. It's the only way. Might just pop on briefly to check my auctions while I'm there....
---
Damn! Now that's some great progress friend! I can definitely understand not wanting to lose that time investment.
---
Idk how complimentary this is, but my alt is a holy paladin, completely different play style, speed, lore, and everything. The only downside is both of them are pretty mindless levelers, hunter being really easy, and paladin being very auto-attacky
---
Take me down to the Thunderbluff city  
---
where the grass is green and the quests are easy.  
---
Oh won't you please take me home.
---
on the bright side, I got like 20 tin nodes from constantly checking those damn water holes for the spores.
---
Another Hunter.
---
Its really not the same class Retail shadow priests are wet noodles.
---
I’m pretty meh on server economy stuff. Almost 20 years of MMOs personally, you have to accept that exploits and gold selling will exist, inflation will happen, and the game will add gold sinks.
---
(I’m fine with inflation happening a little to help me afford my damn mount. I’m at level 21 and barely have one gold even with auctionator and skipping buying spells.)
---
This post is disappointing get off his sick OP
---
You will walk for too long and break the animation, this is normal lol
---
So how good are shadow priests in classic? Also, I see people worried about MC being actual, how fast are they releasing stuff?
---
You also need to connect the ammo to the character at the character sheet (where you see which clothes you have and weapon) - there down to the right, you should see room for the ammo, drag it there and then you have connected it. Remember also that there is different ammo for guns and for bows :)
---
Got to lvl 18 using AAP and then it broke down :(. Leveled to 20 without any questing Add ons and I have to say it is more fun imo but does take a lot longer.
---
I'm not sure how legalese actually reads, but was just checking the TOS today, and while it specifically calls out that a parent may allow a minor child to use their account while they (the adult) is not using it, it doesn't specifically say anything about siblings/spouses/other direct family members.
---
That said, if a husband and wife shared an account, how would anyone know if they log in from the same computer?
---
Really? I’m playing on Stalagg and have hit the level 30s and so far I’ve seen more alliance in both Arathi and STV. I moved to EK bc I didn’t want to do Desolace but I’m having a rough time.
---
I mean, neither you nor I is wrong.
---
That's you being outskilled. L2P.
---
I am on horde. I’ll be on tonight and message you thanks
---
That end. I was like it'll be depression. And then ohh it is divorce. And then the camera goes up and there is depression.
---
Play whatever you want
---
I played 10 years ago on the original wow and it was wonderful never finished to 60 cause all my friends were max and shit. But I did level to like 40. It was fun. Im glad it’s back out as I’ve been playing all weekend and having a blast doing quest walkthrough
---
but the 30 days included?
---
Fat guild mom?
---
That is sad. As a tank, i never pull if my healer is under 50% mana. I also selfbandage between pulls to save some time.
---
Any time
---
There's no overall best, everything has pros and cons. Just try out what sounds good to you.
---
That would be because I've been playing the game. I've barely posted in the last three days.
---
Exactly.  I see a body, I revive it.   I HATE running back, and if I can save someone that pain, then I'll do it.
---
Create?? Create all??
---
Ha jokes on everyone else. I took this week off rather than release week. 🧠
---
Imo you're better of hearthing
---
It's totally reasonable.   No real dps uses 2 handers in raids.  They are purely for funsies offspec items.
---
Mainly because people want to do both pve and pvp, and troll is great at pve but not the best for pvp, so if you want to play both sides troll isn’t the best choice, but in the end it’s all very minimal and every race/class is viable and will work just fine, but for what people’s goals are in game, they decide to go another route other than troll. Also troll is too ugly to a lot of people so they stick to Orc, Tauren or UD more then troll for warrior.
---
Nice trollerino posterino
---
The OG hydro homie
---
They all do.  They think they're super clever with their "durrr just reroll."  But you'll have to forgive them, they don't have any friends so it's hard for them to comprehend the associated difficulties in gettin a group to swap servers
---
Don’t have time to level new character but do have time to set in 3 hour queues, interesting.
---
I wanted to call BS on this so bad but I looked it up and you are right. I can't *believe* people took down Rag within a week of release.

I've seen some streamers with maps that have quest indicators on them. How do I get this?
---
lv 10 warrior quest has a weapon for you
---
Are the weather effects random or is there some setting I don’t see?
---
Was just talking about this with my priest friend last night. In 5 mans generally spirit is a priest/druid stat, since they get crazy good multipliers and are dependent on spirit to regen during fights. However as a lock who runs Imp Soul Drain, that talent makes you want to REALLY stack spirit when leveling, so the group etiquette becomes awkward. Ultimately I decided to generally pass on dungeon spirit gear and rely on crafted and quest gear in order to make healer friends, and once you get to around 50 caster dps and healer gear don't overlap as much so it's a non-issue endgame.
---
Mage life
---
Unless it's the other faction.  Fuck those guys.
---
Anyone remember the infamous elevator boss from SSC? Yeah, Blizzard had a sense of humor back then.
---
He looks like a tribal leader
---
Is this sarcasm or do you really think checking the price of an item is some insanely involved skill that you learned and refined over hundreds of hours?
---
There's also the fact that the playerbase is generally better, so there will likely be a higher percentage of well geared people compared to Vanilla.
---
It's cool if people have fun taking it slow, but they should consider the fact that fighting AQ geared enemies while wearing blue dungeon items is most likely not as fun as they think.
---
Lol! That’s awesome.
---
Why the hell were you reading this? lol
---
We'll see when top ferals start parsing I guess, but I still think that agrees with what the point of this post was, because for casual guilds who don't know and don't care about hard numbers, the perception of what is best is more important than what actually is best.
---
What do you mean? The swing timer should always be the same, shouldnt it? And why would walking break the animation, if when I walk and stop right at the start of the swing, everything will go as expected?
---
Shouldn’t of given them anything if they acting like that, you should of just sent 3c
---
yesterday i was roleplaying too hard and wanted to walk onto the Deeprun Tram as opposed to moving onto it at full speed.
---
didn't make it

Nah, enjoy your ban. Play the game like everyone else.
---
This happened to me on Grobbulus. Foxhound, if you're reading this, I hate you and will remember your name.
---
Its not stealth in any capacity dum dum.
---
Personally,  I'd say no. The total leveling isnt worth it. If you have a 110 boost, knock yourself out
---
Åäö! ♥️
---
To each their own.
---
Once I learned about the ground clutter option, I cranked that up to the max. In many MMO's I've played, I've always been bothered by wide spanning and mostly featureless areas. Fact is, Nature is relentless and will fill every available spot in order to thrive.
---
Spending half an hour actually searching underneath all the plants for quest items is just a bonus.
---
I did, back when i played before I made that deal which i would maintain all B's and above. (im not a great student so thats what my parents expected of me) and it worked, im not sure if they would make that deal again because i quit. My parents are great because they hate me wasting money even if its my choice with my money, rn im too scared to try that again.
---
that is the cutest thing ive ever seen in my life
---
The other day I saw a guy fighting a mob by a chest. I quickly ran and started opening, but I stopped and said "just kidding" and walked away
---
Actually it is his son you are seeing there
---
The wand is definitely worth it.
---
Thanks I got accepted into a deadmines run and we swept through it easy peasy and it was fun too! They let me get some of the int items we found along the way and I got level 20 :D
---
Looking through the comments now, general consensus seems to be "nobody cares".
---
I think you're doing a lot of projecting here.
---
The question is when you phased did you stay in the same spot
---
I'm done with cleave groups, they're not fun to tank at all.
---
"My minion.  If you defeat hi-" \*\*Smack!\*\*

Ty all

Because it's a Very Cool dungeon

How do you use it? /nen does nothing for me.

My bad I thought this was Kromcrush
---
You can walk when it's white but when the white goes away you have to stand still
---
Every item is 30c so 10 items is 3s
---
Ahh I’m actually retarded then, I should be levelling these as I go. Ty~
---
I tuned into asmongold for like a few minutes to see what level he was today. Was arguing with chat over his leveling methods. Do people actually give a shit or are they trolling him? Sure he's not doing it the "right way" but who cares how he plays.
---
I hope you get up and excersize or stretch every 2 hours cause damn man. Glad your having fun but that's hella unhealthy
---
fitting that gay chris is your alliance doppleganger. hes probably got a goat tee or a scar or something too.
---
I've just never seen sun shafts like this in game before :P
---
Ithink it's fine to kill them if you feel like it. personally i try and kill maybe 15% of players I see. corpse camping is kind of shitty though. also it's kind of shitty to kill players who are way lower level. but that is a part of the game and anyone who gets pk'd did make the decision to be on a pvp server so you should never feel bad.
---
Ive had to ask hunters to turn growl ON when we were just questing tigether and it blows my mind, i dont think ive ever asked that before like 2 days ago lol
---
I know, but in cataclysm (my first xpac), dps specs had reliable ways of regenning mana, but healers didnt, so spirit was for healers.
---
The formula for calculating XP in a group is basically as follows:
---
    Player 1 XP = round((Player 1 Mob XP) * (Player 1 Character Level) / (Player 1 Character Level + Player 2 Character Level + Player 3 Character Level + Player 4 Character Level + Player 5 Character Level))
---
If you group with someone who no longer gains experience from the mob:
---
    Player 1 XP = round(((Player 1 Mob XP) * (Player 1 Character Level) / (Player 1 Character Level + Player 2 Character Level + Player 3 Character Level + Player 4 Character Level + Player 5 Character Level) / 2)) + 1
---
What zone should I quest at 27? I already did most of duskwood quests so idk what to do
---
That is why BRD remain my favourite dungeon of all time. It's massive, spans an insane amount of levels, has a ton of stuff going on. etc.. etc..
---
Incredible, peak Dungeon design.

I'm level 20 and 3 silver really isnt a lot.
---
You can \_get by\_ with DM when you're in westfall.  But outside of westfall it's VC or "Deadmines."  As an Alliance player, I don't recall anyone actually doing DireMaul outside of a quest (QS or pally charger) b/c it was so far away.  LBRS/UBRS/BRD/Strath/Scholo were all close in level and way way way closer to Iron Forge.

Can this macro be modified to more than two spells? As a shaman, being able to have four totems on one button would be great (blank,shift,ctrl,alt)
---
Yes powershifting with furor and a helm that gives energy when going into cat form. Also farming Gnomer for pumblers.
---
The main host of the thread is about streamers though. This change doesn’t effect anyone below 40 that was never there. It affects the people already at 50 that abused this mechanic, ie worlds first people and mostly streamers who have the time to play that much.
---
You can easily heal as shadow
---
Created a character yesterday on smolderweb, medium pop pvp. Its plenty active and I've yet to see a queue.
---
At least those scripts, that are pressing some buttons every few seconds stopped working.
---
And some people might be too lazy to find new ways, so its getting better.
---
We all have our opinions and that’s fine. I disagree that it’s not an elitist/gatekeeping attitude. Thinking phone caps is ridiculous is more ridiculous than the caps themselves. 
---
It reminds me of when someone corrects someone’s spelling when they’ve made a post that has an error in it; it distracts from the original purpose of the post and does more to deter community involvement than it does to encourage it. Ultimately, the quality of the screenshot is less important than it is to be patient with people who have different tastes/knowledge about better tech methods.

Same question. Up!

Yeah - I've got a real life friend and some virtual ones that have asked me to raid as a sub. I'd like to be able to have that ability. Is that too much to ask for $15/month?

I'm back at work and in the midst of resetting my sleep schedule now.

I do this too! I roleplay giving "Great warrior" or "The chosen one" greens that I don't need that seems like a good upgrade for whoever I pass. 
---
And sometimes I'm the candyman (Healthstones)
---
If you buddies are all in a full server thats a big rip and part of life I guess. 
---
 I actually don't have that much time and I just picked a server that wasn't full and it's always high when I log on but never full.
---
People like to say how this id do childish and bla bla bla. So what?, its as childish as having and loving a sports team. And in mx opinion blizzard created something truly amazing with the factions because of that reason. They made me have an irrational love for a faction just like i have an irrational love for me footbsll club. And just like i would never in a million years put a Porto jersey on (im a benfica supporter and member(soccer for you americans)), i would never in a million years play Alliance.
---
Druid. It's like carrying a leatherman or swiss army knife around everywhere. I play mostly solo and don't want to rely on others. Druid has everything and all of them are fun. I never feel trapped in emergency situations with only one wat out. I just switch form and try something different.
---
Like omg smh there are new jokes in 2016 XD we can't replay Clssic the way we did XDDDD
---
Killed  Ursangous twice with no drop either. Probably bugged.
---
there's fantastic writing on both sides. shame on you for playing the same faction 13 years, that's closed minded and it's 100% your loss.
---
It helps of the tank has piercing howl for resists. But good luck finding a fury tank.
---
Although the advice hear is sound it's because the game has no fps max, it just pegs your gpu for everything it can to get as many fps as possible. My 1080 rig was blasting fans too until I set a fps limit. With shooters or other click intensive games where accuracy is make or break you want high fps so that's fine. With this game, 60fps is plenty. Set the framerate limit there and save power, heat, battery, and component life.
---
It’s also helps that shamans and paladins are faction specific, breeds a special kind of hate.
---
It’s all good we all hate horde too lol. But I know what you mean
---
They specifically said Kazzak is leashed in classic :-(
---
Oh gotcha. Just went hard for the first week. Awesomeol glad you had fun
---
Hasn't been a problem for me.
---
It's called "Moonbrook of Westfall Miner Dungeon Cavern Place With Underground Pirate Ship" or MoWMDCPwUPS.
---
I definitely understand that these things affect all of us, there’s a ripple effect that happens with exploits and things of this nature and it matters. But my oh my people are acting like the game is ruined and that’s just not the case. These are tiny little hiccups that will balance out within a couple weeks. It’s not the end of the world.
---
As I see it...
---
* Is this a major screw up? YES!
---
* Could it have been prevented? ABSOLUTELY! (Some QA heads should roll for this)
---
* Is it the only major screw up with this launch? NO!
---
* Does this effect the game long term? YES!
---
* Can it be corrected? NO! (Not completely)
---
Many more problems like this and Classic will end up being a short term cash cow for Blizzard. Heck, private servers may even become a better play environment if they continue to spiral in.
---
In short, I think they really better get it together before they loose their good thing!
---
Yes yes, I know. I do that. If do that within a time frame, everything will work as expected. If you keep walking after the white has ended and stand still, the swing will take longer. Why does this happen? Is it intended? Ive watched some videos of pservers and it didnt happen so idk.
---
What is an RP server exactly?  I don't understand
---
Only humanoid enemies will drop cloth
---
That would dun 40 man raids and mid to high settings with no lag? At least 60fps?
---
It's alright, group with hunters and rogues. Do it normally, I will be. Cleave groups can shove it.
---
We did pick a server that wasn't full.  It was a "new" server.  We started on Herod, and then moved to Skeram.
---
I haven't "forgotten" all I said was that it hasn't been a problem for me.
---
Can horde get that pet from the whelps there? I would imagine so but doesn't hurt to ask :)
---
Still at work :D
---
I literally left a dungeon that I was tanking because the dps didn't want to listen to me. They wouldn't single target dps so they were aggroing  multiple mobs, they weren't respecting the location in which i want to pull mobs to  avoid pulling adds. They were aoeing and burning through mana before any of the mobs were killed. They were taking so much damage the healer couldn't keep their heals on me.
---
Mail/plate repairs arent a fucking joke too
---
SoOooooooOoooo deep
---
I used my Staff of Westfall from 18 to 27. Pretty decent
---
Do people who run tank warrior ever use abilities outside of protection to do damage while leveling or just mob grinding or mostly stick to defensive abilities? In essence, what abilities would a tank warrior run to pitch out some damage?
---
So do you just mail a ton of stuff to another toon? Then he puts it in the bank?
---
Lol that reminds me of people that hitch a ride on the city trolly in the 50s as it departs

I flew from tarren mill to sepulcher, 1 silver, sepulcher to tarren mill is 3 silver. Guess you gotta pay for the risk of a wyvern going to the mill.

Grizzly Hills is my absolute favorite zone in the game.
---
Alliance on my server so far only attacking if they’re 5+ levels above you and are in a group. Pussies man
---
All of the ways
---
Yea i think ive seen this yeaaarrrrrssss  ago lol
---
I don't need a following, I can play the game just fine without free stuff tossed at me. Even if I'd not want it. At least I'd pay them for the stuff. Also calm your tits.
---
&gt;As far as tech goes, particularly in graphics, WoW was always pretty far behind.
---
and here's where you're 100% wrong! they were far behind in *art style*, but absolutely not "graphics technology". go read the wow dev diary by John Staats.  the engine was written from the ground up using extremely clever and ingenious techniques which allowed it to be played on more systems than any other MMO--which was INSTRUMENTAL to their success.
---
Sempai looks different
---
Hahaha this the greatest thing I've read since release
---
I see. Two popular servers. I went with thunderfurry. It's always high when I log in but never full.
---
People like that make me wanna puke lol. Glad you got the little twat.
---
Do you play Horde?   That is my easy solution to this problem.
---
Maybe I'll consider it after I level my alts.
---
Are you using the shoot command in your general skill tab?
---
You can already turn on enemy bars. Some QoL additions are already in the game if they didn't change playstyle. 
---
Things like tab auto complete and such are good to have without changing the game.
---
You oughta check out ArkInventory for a bag addon.  It let's you customize where items go.  Like you can separate categories, like Trash, Food, Drink, Quest items into different areas of the "Bag" so it makes it much easier to see.  You can get crazy with rules or you can keep it really basic, very customizable.  It was an original vanilla addon that I have always used. Best bag addon I've ever used.
---
You know these websites existed during vanilla dont you.
---
You know server discords are a thing where people make groups out of game dont you
---
You know making groups like this has been a thing since the days of EQ
---
What a save! Spectacular!
---
Difference is the entire post is this image and the image looks like crap because of the method OP took to get the image.
---
It's not being pedantic about spelling when we can understand what someone means.  This is I click on the post and am greeted by vomit.  OP would get a lot more positive comments and karma if they took a quality screenshot instead.
---
Ayy it that blazblue meme
---
I highly recommend "The WoW Diary" by dungeon designer John Staats. He also has an anekdote in his book about that icon you are curiois about.
---
Yes please. No one need to know this.
---
RIP
---
Already done
---
I'm about to start out as a mage this thursday. Arcane intelligence for all! Except rogues...
---
Raiding is a joke in Vanilla now. Speedrunning is where the scene is heading to
---
Depends on how much you're doing dungeons tbh. I've been levling a priest (currently LVL 38) and I can tell you that killing mobs my lvl 1v1 is not a challenge at all. I have been, and I'd 'recommend (I am planning to) spec disc up until shadowform since questing up until then is pretty much the same no matter which spec, and after that spec Shadow if you're doing more quests, if not just keep on speccing disc/holy
---
I played with someone that told me that too. I was honestly so excited for them lol. I think it's really interesting, there was a def before and after with cata.
---
Never knew that, fun facts.

This is it

Experienced MMO player but still learning classic. I'm an NA player available usually in the afternoon or evenings. I'm open to starting new characters and love making alts so moving is not an issue. I mostly enjoy playing druid and hoping to heal/tank any group content. I'm looking for something slow paced, taking time to enjoy the quests and the zones. If we get to endgame that's great of course but not necessarily the goal. Just looking for any group of players who want to consistently play together and enjoy the time we spend playing.

Found the whiny care bear. Bet you think everyone should be given participation trophies in sports too.

"Whenever there is a hard job to be done I assign it to a lazy man; he is sure to find an easy way of doing it."
---
I like how you used "Lazy fanboys will always defend lazy people." As some sort of defence against any counter point to your argument. 
---
In all though, I agree with you. Except for the lazy rant, right before your actual comment.
---
just report them and move along. i've gotten maybe 5 hours of time in game and had the entire week off last week because of these people. Blizz kicks folks off here and there and you'll see the queue drop by half the folks ahead of you but on my server it's still 5000 folks ahead.
---
I like twitch streamers there plenty of people on twitch that definitely better gaming communities. Cohh carnage and LethalFrag for example.
---
Abilities were normalized to not scale with wep speed in the patch we are playing on. Abilities use weapon damage (or a % of it) to determine damage.
---
Wait, why are you holding W if there’s autorun?
---
I spend 8 hours and 45 mins at level 22 AMA
---
Apart from the one guy refusing to go Deadmines with us since my friend on a dps warrior was only lvl 17 so the run would be too slow for him, I've had a ton more people enjoying the questing about than I've had levvellers. Maybe they are just further ahead, not bomping around in the low 20s.
---
I don't want to have to spend a bunch of gold respecing later on though
---
and their parents who own the basements they live in.
---
On the same realm theres kind of "mini-realms", 1000 people on the server may be in the same zone but they split it in to 10 layers with 100 in each to stop over crowding.
---
yeah kiting kazzak was removed in vanilla really quickly after people did it. It's because he specifically has an enrage mechanic that shoots shadowbolts at every target near him in a HUGE radius. Its designed to wipe a raid that takes too long killing him, but it means him being in a city completely fucked it.
---
Agreed. It's borderline obsessive.
---
Metal Gear fanboys... sigh...
---
Thats exactly what I was thinking, does that not happen anymore?
---
Your first respec is dirt cheap.
---
Everyone I was playing with were also all drinking coffee and talking about it, around 8:00 am this morning!
---
Yes, I want to have extra buffs and bring something extra to the table in dungeons and raids.  Plus if I can get some rare cooking recipes later, I can earn extra cash towards mount, gear, etc.
---
How about you do some research then form an opinion. Or keep being one of those people who cant help themselves
---
Get out of here with that "Oops" just own it man you obviously didn't bring him to Goldshire to make friends.  Don't cop out on the achievement.
---
Prolly really bad for your knees tbh
---
They’re in the ammo slot on my character screen, the small slot to the right of my bow, pointing to the bow. That’s what you mean right?
---
Are you using the "Shoot Bow" button? Guns, bows, and crossbows have a different ability to shoot; it is not a general "shoot" button.
---
It's an android app though, what's the big deal? If you have an outrage over this then I can't imagine how you react with Discord
---
I don't think there's been any talk of transfers any time soon
---
Be safe and just cut your losses. At most it's 3 days played; is that such a huge sacrifice months down the line when you're on a dead server with no one to play with?
---
I definitely dont use an auto clicker to ping my map every 3 mins
---
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BauplPKCIAE8uP2.jpg:large
---
9200 on stalagg right now
---
That or nodes of herbs or ore. Or heck, even the skinners taking mobs under your feet.
---
Yes it is. Killing green mobs is not really a problem since you should be able to kill them very quickly and easily and they still give good xp. A quest is not worth it if you have to kill multiple grey mobs imo.
---
Speaking from druid, I can heal 5mans in my feral spec and gear (though I have aimed for dual and tristate gear because of how valuable mana is for lvling)
---
No bag space for that fishing equipment
---
Zeg makker!
---
There's a meme build for hunters where they stack int (so a lot of cloth armor) and they spam arcane shot. It's pretty hilarious actually.

Definitely meant to say you don't need the showtooltip part, just the # then spell name.

sorry not sorry

I'm role playing a thief, occupational hazard
---
Get to work, probably will take more then a couple
---
how so? i thought everyone in vanilla hated shadow priests?
---
that being said i never liked pvp so if your talking in that vain then i could probably see it
---
Cool, thanks. As a level 10 Priest I need all the easy kills I can get!
---
I'd not risk my account but to each their own.
---
I’m good with wpvp. But what really pisses me off is that I can have a good time fighting off an alliance member I’m sharing a leveling zone with, however 90% of my alliance interactions are 5 man groups of people 5-10 levels higher farming lower level zones.
---
Alliance are all cowardly douchebags. I wouldn’t even care if it was a 5 man group of similar levels, but it’s literal pussies that can’t handle people on their power level
---
I don't really understand what you're asking, but I'll let you know that my favourite expansions are TBC&gt;Vanilla&gt;Wotlk&gt;---------&gt;Cata
---
Damn that just saved me a lot of time
---
Targeting, yes
---
Moving, no
---
tell them to remake.
---
no transfer for a very long time
---
I am looking to see what you mean
---
It's inevitable server transfers will come. When? No one knows.
---
Haven’t used the boat yet, no idea.
---
I don’t know where to ask, but are there other useful console commands to use? I’m completely new to classic never played WoW until a year ago
---
Is there any data available on how many people still play bfa after the launch of classic?
---
If you're leveling protection, it's going to be slow and frustrating. I did it for a few levels back in the day. I also ran out of gold for respecs because I was wishy-washy on my build back then and was stuck in protection spec. I desperately wanted to get back to an arms spec. You can tank just fine in arms or fury if you bring a shield along and are wearing gear that has high armor. You won't have to worry about respec unless you just really want to along the way.
---
Oh really? How much would you say it is approximately?
---
Jubjub the imp
---
Hubthak the voidy
---
Elerva the succy
---
Luthuum the good boy
---
Pretty happy tbh. Honestly really really happy. Especially with Elerva and Jubjub.
---
The odds of being on a dead server is slim to none
---
Thanks, I’m trying to figure out what you mean
---
the music when you land the jump is what makes this.
---
Jhomvhug- Void walker
---
Imp - Tarkol
---
It is even easier second time around also. Knowledge is power and all that.    
---
But sadly I am not the one orphaned and I have mentioned this already.
---
Are you putting the WorldMap folder in your addon folder? If so, it doesn't go there - just drop it in the interface folder right next to your addon folder.
---
&gt;/console ShowClassColorInNameplate 1
---
This might work.
---
You waste 5-10m of their time. Longer if they are in your factions zones (like killing alli near sfk)
---
Mine doesn't work at all. Not sure if it's the website we are getting it from or what
---
The biggest argument against a wow2 has always been that people have been playing for 14 years and they'd be pissed to lose all their progress. Classic has demonstrated that a fresh start is super popular. Wow2 has to be more likely today than it was a month ago.
---
Is that a PSA or are you trying to tell people what to do?

Ohhhh my god this is the greatest troll of all time

Have to fly around all that unfinished terrain in between zones lol
---
Press "P" to open your spellbook.  In the general skills tab there should be a skill called "Shoot."  Put that on your hotbar, and if you have the bow + arrows equipped, it'll work!
---
Well it'd make sense if they were separate companies
---
I know and ive done that, doest work sadly.
---
well you joined the streamer server so you messed up there
---
Living up to your name there. VOLDEMORT.
---
I'm lvl 16, but so far I can farm 2-3 mobs at once, or chain-kill single mobs. 
---
The rotation I've used is: 
---
1. Curse of agony + start pet attack  
---
2. Corruption  
---
3. Immolation (optional, due to mana cost) 
---
4. Situational -- wand attack // shadow bolt // fear // or repeat rotation on new mob while the last mob dies(or almost dies) from dots. The mobs shouldn't attack you from the dot damage if using voidwalker.
---
Personally I wouldn't watch but there's gotta be an audience for this, I would just go for it.
---
Question: do your unit frames also show numeric health for friendly targets... if they do, HOW?!
---
Alternatively, get the Advanced Interface Options addon and set the Nameplate slider to the distance you want.

Fully agree. I'm semi-hardcore, not a casual but not hardcore either. I'd rather people have time to get into it. At least 3-4 months for Phase 1 is my opinion.

I don’t know why people think this is a debate.

Just got my 2070 Super in last week, just in time lol!

Welp, that's great. What's the second most popular realm in that case?

Some servers already Low tagged?

Definite respawn at server restart
---
Blizzard has already explained why. It’s not a technical constraint.

If you think so and feel better with it ok. But we did what we did. Ah and go wear a dress healerdin 🤓

When you hide it, all players will see your bald head.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cywqpn/thats_why_i_love_classic/).

 And then you get the beautiful feeling only Warlocks and Druids know where you BRez/Soulstone a healer during a clear wipe... and watch them take it...
---
(Or when you use it in a pull that could be saved and watch them stay)
---
Yepp it does apply for the perspective of other players.

WTF is with this sub and using their phones to take pictures of wow? Wow has a fucking screenshot keybind, by default! You don’t need to install anything or configure anything. It’s literally idiot prof.

Kromkrush is 50/50 and mostly full with small q times maybe like 10-20 mins usually
---
I'm horde 😘
---
Based on my queue time most of us can't even get into the game to play anyway! 
---
Lol I don't mind though I love heavily populated games and idc when I hit 60, but man.. trying to get into Stalagg during the day hurts the soul.
---
Not positive but I'm pretty sure duskwood is alliance controlled. There are no horde settlements. Correct me if I'm wrong but it's adjacent to Elwynn forest which has Stormwind and is human starting zone. One zone south is Stranglethorn Vale which definitely is contested.
---
I'm surprised the word Gay in a name doesnt force an auto name change
---
Giving you a heads up
---
There are many underlying issues with WoW just because it’s an MMO. They want to remove layering by phase 2 and any sort of realm transfers or merges down the line mean endless renames and people angry they had the give up their name and many servers becoming barren because everyone can just play in the mega server with endless layers.
---
I find the best players in WoW are usually the nicest ones, they naturally attract others and build strong connections and will help people to achieve greatness rather than shit over them for a mistake. My guildleader in Vanilla was one of the most chill dudes ever, he'd spend hours farming for raids while still helping any newer players run through instances like Scholo/Strat to get their gear up despite him being in Tier2. If he ever needed a hand, about a dozen players would instantly ping him for an invite because they wanted to return the favor. 
---
Even small things can make a big difference, someone in IF yesterday was sending out invites to players trapped in another layer (Where no NPC's existed) and I thought that was really awesome. If you're a mage/priest/paladin/druid and you buff people as you run by, people will take notice and help you out if they see you down the road. If someone is struggling with some mobs, help them out even if it's not your quest or a little out of your way, people will appreciate small things like that. 
---
Small things really add up, people remember tiny interactions even if you don't, and sometimes all you need to do is ask someone to join a party to become great online buds down the road.
---
Was having same issue. 
---
Finally able to solve it not only by uninstalling but also, after removing it, following these instructions: [https://eu.battle.net/support/pt/article/34719](https://eu.battle.net/support/pt/article/34719)  
---
Only after removing that folder, when installing, the agent updated and it managed to install the new version and all was working
---
No problem. Glad I could be of some help to you!
---
It is an issue, but it's a solvable one.
---
If you have autoloot option checked, holding shift when you loot will not autoloot.
---
i don't play on US but herod is probably the 2nd highest pop
---
The reason I don’t play on a PvP server. I’m horde also but I can’t stand pvp ganking sometimes. Was on the escort quest from theramore watch back to ratchet and right at the end an alliance warrior was leaving ratchet. If he had ganked me and I failed the quest I would have been so frustrated.
---
0/10 no flight path area.
---
&gt; Almost as bad when I’m at a mining node and someone else comes up and tries to steal the next click.
---
I just want one swing for the skill point, the rest is yours.
---
the game did not look nearly this good at launch. the engine improvements make a huge difference.
---
Shamans can’t use swords
---
Yeah I like everything you wrote in theory, the challenge I see it in is I don't believe that's how most people who play the game operate.  For the most part people don't play games to make it be something that requires that much work to do things like this and while a hardcore person might consider that "filters working as intended", it just means that attrition is faster than it needs to be and that ultimately hurts the game.  I've known a lot of WoW players over the years, I can't think of any that have gone to the lengths you have described to form groups, maybe they did and I just didn't know it.  I know I didn't and I was a Naxx raider back in vanilla.
---
I don't know how to balance it, but I know it's heavily weighted on inconvenient in Classic and it's likely going to be off-putting to a lot people.  Even when you're in a guild, you can have 50 people online and none of them are interested in running that instance and then what?  You go to Channel 4 and spam away.  If you're on a high population server that channel is like watching Asmongold's Twitch chat, just so many people spamming, it's just not practical.
---
And yet, even while bugged and giving more exp than it ever has or will, it still wasn't an effective way to level lol.
---
Stop posting that IRL ghoul
---
QQ
---
To an extent; however, it does propel forward the elite and further their control. Top  guilds are multilayer exploiting full devilsaur sets in just a few hours. An advantage that isn't available to the more casual players. I never said it will ruin the economy. It certainly won't help it.
---
Srsly
---
Most annoying shit ever, especially if they let it sit until it expires.
---
You don't pay for a Private Server. Kind of hard to justify paying $15 a month for a game less hard then the free private server.
---
Go to barrens chat where the real boys become men.
---
If you love this, you’ll love DM. All 3 dungeons are connected  in one outer world building, each with multiple floors and halls.
---
I saw you going past in westfall, thought you were taking him to SW xD
---
Pretty sure it tracks key presses, holding down a Dutton doesn’t work and neither does running into a wall, there’s a video on YouTube of a guy who made a contraption that presses his space bar every few seconds, probably the only thing I’ve seen that isn’t against ToS.
---
Yes it’s a thing. I always make a profit off the AH from selling whatever I won’t use. I don’t price it high though, just more than I’d get from a vendor. Like a 15s weapon will be 20s. It’s just 5 extra silver but hey it’s something.
---
And he'll get my fucking gloves!
---
What are all these responsibilities? 
---
When I was 14 I had to go to school, come home and do a bunch of homework and chores then I could play some.
---
Now I just work a 9-5 and the rest is free time. If anything I have more time now to play.
---
I was advertising for a mage to aoe grind with because I wanted grind a few levels without quests and unfortunately taking a paladin won’t cut it when frost nova coc and blizzard is just so op. Don’t get upset if people don’t invite you to aoe grind groups because that’s just what they are.
---
He’s so disappointed
---
Dr stone is fantastic
---
Resto Tauren Druid on a high pop server. May not be the best like a holy priest but they have a great leveling experience that will keep you interested until 60, are very useful in pve for innervate, and in my opinion the best pvp healer with how versatile they can be with flag running if needed.
---
This is what goes through the mind of the horde smooth brains when they see an alliance questing who’s 15 levels lower than them.
---
It does. Did this on the way to Booty Bay and got dumped into the ocean. Swam to Booty Bay amd swam too close to the island with the elite Tide Giant outside town and he swam out into the ocean and killed me....
---
thats true, i hate when people try to ruin my classic experience while im trying to enjoy my precious chicken tendies
---
$10,000
---
It's funny coming to games like wow from OSRS where a typical rare boss drop is 1 in 128 to 1 in 3000 and grinding drops for so many hours is the norm.  I think I'll go after one of these for a quick stint of cash.  I like the grindy side of games and things like this are fun to me.
---
Thanks for this! Im a new player so im a bit nervous for my first dungeon. Are healers generally an easier role?
---
I know, I just cracked up.  Felt bad, but he was SO SURE
---
Are you a good tank? Do you mark clear cc targets and dps targets and explain it clearly what you expect from them at the start? If they do something foolish do you explain that you do need a second to gen threat. On tricky pulls to do you explain the plan on your pull and that they might need to hold an extra second or two.
---
Communication makes a good tank, along with clear marking, then good rotation of abilities and planning for taunting the aggro back etc when it is pulled. Expect aggro to be pulled and be ready for it. If you complain about having to use taunt regularly, then I would argue you are a bad tank. If you expect people to know the dungeons and pulls and perform them perfectly without communication, I would argue you are a bad tank. 
---
P.S. I tank

WW Axe is fantastic, but I doubt most Warriors would do that quest, it's a really annoying/long questline and you'll need guildies or friends to help.
---
I think this sort of virtual tribalism is healthy for the game and fun. If it isn’t taken too far of course!
---
All horde races are solid for PvE. I like Tauren racials more overall than orc, I do a mix of pvp and pve but I can’t stand Tauren model tail so orc it is for me. Gonna enjoy stun resist in PvP and also axe specialization has been great while leveling
---
People can be funny about requirements in low level dungeons where my job as a healer is basically the rare heal while being a wand-spamming chat member.
---
Dude I literally got it last night!!! One of the best quest chains I've ever done. I was soloing SFK with my priest friend and we took out half the dungeon until we got to the adds that silence you, after that we kept getting killed. So much fun and still got the hammer haha
---
The dude said his friends were rushing to 60.
---
My friends and I keep pretty similar hours, so I have no trouble playing with them most days. If you can only play with your friends one day a week, then I think it goes without saying that people will be different levels (and that that point you're not even really playing/leveling *with* them, just on the same realm as them).
---
You can sort it so you dont see it. So its w.w
---
Yeah I agree, the small things really make this community great. The other day I had barely started and was like lvl 5. I was being chased by 3 mobs and was close to dying, when this guy ran up to me to get all the aggro. Nice community :)
---
Download AllyRoute man, it will save even more time. Locations marked on your map. Quest indicators on the map. And a little leveling guide to help you out if you want to use it
---
We may hate each other but in the end we both share a love for the game :)
---
er okay thanks but this is the classic subreddit, and not every second of my play can i revolve around spending 1.5 hours forming a dungeon group then running to a dungeon.
---
No. Engineering is very expansive to lvl. Wait till 60.

Then swap at 60 once you have your devilsaur mats farmed.

Night elf?
---
Chad?
---
Physically weak effeminate tree huggers that are so bad at staying alive that they need to slurp down magic just to survive? Food and drink aren't enough for them like every other living creature huh? And they're a chad?
---
Alright kids listen up, clearly I need to set some shit straight here.
---
Humans, elves, trolls, tauren, and orcs are lanklets. That's right. L A N K L E T S. And one day superior dwarf engineering will initiate the tallocaust.
---
It goes without saying that gnomes are manlets, and also intrinsically evil. Behind every tragedy and misfortune is a grinning gnome. They're gremlins with babyfaces. Gnomes will get a shallow grave because they don't need or deserve six feet.
---
Dwarves are the perfectly proportioned people of Azeroth. Strong. Sturdy. Stocky. Neither too tall, nor too short. Make height jokes all you want. A dwarf will still punch straight through your steel cup.
---
The dwarf uprising is coming.
---
Well, both players can get a level up in their mining skill, at least ask the current miner
---
&gt;because it plays the smoothest
---
The game runs smooth in terms of FPS and graphics because it is ancient. The combat is very unsmooth and feels more like a waiting game because it is ancient.
---
Sure. I'll help you out. I'll even be generous. It will take majority of raiding guilds 3 times as long as APES. So 3 weeks for a Rag and Ony Kill from level 60?
---
The content isn't hard. What made Vanilla hard was a raid of 40 people on dial up and 3/4s not on comms.
---
I would give my left tit for World of Warcraft 2.
---
That is also very true! I didn’t even think of that but that’s a big part as well.
---
How cool would it be if players could put up their own “wanted” signs with rewards for turning in proof of a kill of the targeted player.
---
If you dont know if you can raid as a ret, you probably wont be able to.  Its a tough class to pull off and theres only one spot in a raid for one.  Theres tons of rets who have been preparing for this moment.  Warlock is a safer choice, but if you want to put in effort, there is always a chance
---
Really? You see many people in chat asking for dire maul? Plenty people in chat looking for DM on my server. Can't call dibs for a dungeon that isn't in the game
---
I play on PvP servers for the added tension of getting killed (as well as the decision to kill someone) and because it is cool with farming later on, when you can kill off other faction players that take too much from your farmspot.
---
Not necessesarily because I want every single zone to become constant carnage.
---
Look in the addons section for classic.
---
welcome to classicwow
---
Thanks all! 👍👍
---
Yeah I think so. It's an addon called RealMobHealth
---
I looked forward to a time lapse photo of all these characters in every dungeon all the way to the end of naxx.
---
Make it so OP
---
Is it because fish sticks are crispy and delicious, and I'm the voice if a generation? No that cant be it...
---
Because we are inside them
---
Is thrall not the warchief anymore?
---
It's not about the chest, it's about having courtesy for the other players. When you do these kind of things it shows that you are capable of any dick move so that you can get your way and, frankly, it's not the kind of person I would like to play with. It's actually the very definition of a toxic player.
---
If you are still ahead of most people you’ll be fine. I’m 29 currently and trying to aoe the miners in hillsbrad is a pain due to everyone going in the cave. Same with farmers. So unless you’re in the higher 30s it might not be great
---
I'm forced to playing horde because of my friends and you just broke my heart with this :(
---
Lol I do this frequently. If not me then somebody else. I'll worry about sharing at 60.
---
I think being able to turn invisible is cool as fuck and I find casters boring to play so Rogue was pretty much it. Besides I like the variety of the class. You can be a dagger rogue, a combat swords rogue, a hemo rogue, deep sub rogue, deep assassination with Seal Fate, a meme Mace Rogue. Tons of variety just in weapon choices.
---
Kirtonos, high pop no que!

---
I bet your ass that you weren't flamed out of the forums. SWTOR had a lot of issues at launch and it was impossible to not notice. I remember there was something to do with shadows that would cause unholy lag for everyone the first 3-4 days.  
---
SWTOR combat itself though was very nice once the lag issues got settled within a week or two. The main reason why SWTOR lost so many subscribers is primarily lack of content. On the second week people were bitching about lack of end game. Everyone completed it then drifted back to what they were playing before. WoW already had it's shit load of content so everyone went back there where they already invested so much time. It's why WoW will take another decade at a minimum to die. I'm betting three.
---
I wish that were true, but you're not free to shit on BFA. I dare you to go make a post in r/WoW being critical of BFA and see what happens.
---
what does a swiftness potion usually go for
---
Just got that BFD want today. It has a great glow effect on it. Real spoopy. But if you go at 18 you’ll need a group that’ll carry you. The boss you need to kill for it is level 27.
---
I think you couldn't be more wrong. Less than 10% of my 100+ person guild has BfA. My friends and I haven't played in 10+ years and we've come back en mas.
---
Hey great choice man! Welcome to the Horde! I was alliance for 15 years, started as a NE warrior, so this time around I wanted to change it up so now I’m Horde for the first time and loving it. Nice change of pace, cities are fresher to me and it feels like a different game I love it. Good luck with your warrior man hope you enjoy it.
---
Like the other poster said don't open it. It will be worth a lot more than the one month free subscription. Once you open it, its value will be near 0.

Sometimes the warrior should pull. Sometimes the rogue should pull. Sometimes the mage + rogue. Sometimes the hunter should pull. 
---
It isn't black and white "let the warrior pull".
---
That's a good way to wipe also
---
People thinking highly of Asmongold is what created this problem. Streamers are entertainers and I can understand the desire for some people to get a shout out on someone's stream, or to want to help support their favorite streamers' hobby (or lifestyle for some, I guess) of streaming.. but to what degree? Asmongold is the product of what you get when you continually pamper and reward someone for essentially no reason.
---
Common mage world PvP single target strategy = from ambush, open with sheep, then proceed with the largest spell you have (e.g. pyroblast) and when that spell flies towards the unfortunate sheep, start casting another one, usually frostbolt and then pop fireblast right after you finish casting the second spell. A ????ton of damage as an alpha strike. Other casters should be dead now, for others counterspell heals or frost nova melee when they run towards you, cast another damage spell and pop fireblast that is off CD by now. Have fun! :D
---
Quartz is what I used in BC for Arms and Slam but I haven't found a working download yet. Hook a brother up?
---
Guess horde tough isn't tough enough
---
Don’t kid yourself, Horde are doing the same.
---
The fastest way to clear is no wipes, no drama.
---
This is exactly what I always thought. Similar to how it's cheaper to fly between bigger cities IRL.
---
if someone's there trying to skill up there's literally no reason not to let them skill up
---
No one is complaining. You're just interpreting it that way so you can... Complain.
---
Hunter melee weapons are mostly stat sticks and a way of applying wing clip in melee. Use whatever you have to give you the most stats. Typically 2 handers are better though but at 60 2x Bone Slicing Hatchets with + 15 agility enchants are great until you get your epic staff from MC.
---
Seems to be pretty similar quest level range to duskwood, I've done it the other way round - duskwood is next for me!
---
Wollug-Kirtonos, excommunicato.  One hour.  14 million USD.  Open Contract.
---
Wait is he zapped? Did you seriously stunned him to take a picture? This is awesome.
---
Screenshots are good, but something like diablo 2 where killing a player drops an ear, that you can turn in for a reward from other community members would be really fun imo. Using a third party method to exchange screenshots might be a bit cumbersome to some
---
 Yeah, agreed. 
---
It's a tough pill to swallow for some Warriors because we're told that Asscandy and such should be Warrior priority, and we all tell horror stories of that guild that let the hunter take the first one with his DKP.
---
But then you examine it critically and it's all bullshit. Hunters and Druids should have 2h priority if they're going to use it in the raid, and if not, it's fair game for Paladins and Warriors. 
---
It's funny, Hand of Rag kinda became a default Paladin weapon though, because Warriors mace spec kinda sucks, so we took everything else.
---
Some people actually justify it as a good deed to leave the stuff they don't need.
---
It's like when my sister always left a single cookie in the box to aafe herself the walk to the trash can for the box. It's just scummy
---
Take skinning, its really worth it. Most of my gold comes from light leather.
---
5 pm est sitting in a queue of 7000 people on Skeram
---
Indeed. Enjoy the damn game and stop worrying about what some stupid streamer is doing. If somebody doesn't want to encounter streamers and their entourage, there's plenty of other servers where they don't play.
---
That's a retarded statement. He clearly doesn't care about the addon, why would he want to put in effort to find it?
---
Still down this morning.. 2 days now. Apparently there are some layers that have NPCs you can get invited to -_-
---
They stopped talking about numbers, I suspect because they weren't brag worthy anymore.
---
I mean there's way more (that I've seen) toxicity from BFA players because they're on some crusade against people who dislike the current state of the game, because liking Classic somehow invalidates BFA or something.  
---
It's pretty silly.
---
Like shit
---
even with the original client it still looks good. you're forgetting we have private servers which still use the original client
---
How do you kill those that has no life?
---
Sure, but what about when there's 30 people sitting on the spawn spot and competing for the tag? You don't want to target the dead one.
---
I've received flyers in the mail for basically my whole life. I keep the ones im interested in and put the rest in the recycling. I don't get outraged
---
Ah, this is the classic wow reddit, I just always assume it’s about classic
---
How is layer hopping achieved?
---
Do you mean VC?
---
That and adult health issues. I remember back in the good ole days I could sit like a stump for countless hours and not hear my joints creaking.
---
I guess save the money you make and get your own bank account and a debit card and pay for it
---
Well to be fair, level 11, 3s is a decent number.
---
Verigan’s Fist is so cool
---
Because it hasn't been fun.
---
It's using the Battle For Azeroth engine though.
---
This is genius. I hope it becomes reality
---
Remote access is your friend.
---
My favorite: “It’s better to have quest and died than to never have quested at all”
---
Sadly people are too invested in what other people do and trying to force them to meet their demands. It's really pathetic tbh. I can't imagine being that interested in what someone is doing to  make threads about it like some people have been doing here.
---
On the whole my dungeon running experience has been pretty good though, with just a few eedjits who've refused to listen when I ask nicely. If they don't though, I've simply been telling DPS to quit their bullshit or get replaced. That usually calms them down a little, and if they get huffy it's not like it's hard to find other DPS for leveling dungeons at the moment.

I stopped my lvl 14 paladin and switched to westfall.  It is always low-high but never full.  Consider joining us!
---
Yeah that’s fair, maybe I was a little harsh
---
No but I did play on several servers for 2 years in Vanilla and never once saw somebody refer to it as DM. So there’s that.
---
&gt;Thoughts?
---
Don't worry about things that don't affect you?
---
ahhhhhhh okay thanks!
---
 Just bring back the OLD OLD ruleset.

"One need, one greed."
---
If two players are on say, Benediction-US, but do not see eachother when standing in the same place, they're on different layers. If they have exterior means of communication, such as a Community Discord, they can enter contact and have one invite the other to a party. Whoever the host of the party is will be the one with the host layer, and the invitee will change to that layer.
---
I'll check it out! I'm not the biggest fan of how bagnon looks so I will test it out today :)
---
Omg now I feel hungry after playing 10 hours straight
---
Can you provide proof that people were getting banned for talking bad about BFA?
---
I am hoping deep dive VR gets figure out before I die so I can live my last years in an mmo world like this.
---
You got to lvl 17 with no abilities? Not even a pet???
---
Ez junk auto sells greys
---
If you’re a Murloc, Trogg, or Quillboar, both factions are pretty genocidal.
---
Spirit is a pretty good stat while leveling if you are doing the normal route of questing.  More healer focused at end game.
---
lmao. I also witnessed a hunter trying to tame it get made when everyone else killed it but it was the hunter's spawn.
---
So i've finally gotten to using this and this is actually incredible. Just want to say thank you again firstly. I was able to very effectively tank dungeons underlevel, it was great fun and pugs couldnt believe I used to play a horribly equipped balanced druid.
---
I seem to have stumbled upon a bit of a bug however and I cant quite figure out why it's happening.
---
So I took your button 1 macro and split it out such that I always had Heroic strike/auto attack macro on button 1 and button 2 was Cleave/Sunder (I know you took a lot of time to make it work and I'm sorry I'm taking your baby apart!)
---
So the format of my button 2 is now very similar to the other buttons like button 3. However, something weird is happening where my using alt+2 changes me immediately into defensive stance and sunders, whereas my using shift+2 sunders and then changes into battle stance. I've attached the code below, it's driving me absolutely nuts!
---
It seems as if the code is being executed bottom up? Would appreciate any advice.
---
&gt;\#showtooltip \[mod:alt\]\[nomod,stance:2\]Sunder Armor;Cleave  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;/use \[mod:shift\]Battle Stance;\[mod:ctrl\]Berserker Stance;\[mod:alt\]Defensive Stance  
---
&gt;/use \[stance:2\]Sunder Armor;Cleave
---
&gt; You can already turn on enemy bars. How do you do this?
---
pretty sure that's a reference to the shitty BFA world quest(s)
---
I dont believe that for a second. They have less than 40 people from their guild playing classic? Absolutely bullshit.
---
It's understandable. Gamers have that fire.  I'd be the same way I'm sure haha. I'm like that in Overwatch anyways some days.
---
It's 1g the first time, 5g the next and keeps doubling every time until it caps at 100g.
---
It's literally the only way to deal proper damage before windfury though. Flametongue is thrash in comparison. If the shaman hits the same target as the tank, the threat should not exceed the warriors.
---
Called him out lol
---
Inb4 mods delete this at 1.7k for being low effort xd
---
That's good to know.  I have name plates on and normally I just select my tanks target (i have the "show targets target" thing selected)  and do it that way but that takes more clicks and more time.
---
you can autorun, but not afk

When Oblivion meets WoW
---
Kirtonos has very small queues in peak hours. 300-800. It’s full in peak hours (5-7pm pst it’s full) then after that, when the eastern folks have to go to bed, it’s still high up until 12am to sometimes 2am until the western folks have to log off. I’m loving it, even with layers it still feels alive.
---
UnitFramesImproved could be that one
---
Yeah I haven’t had an issue with it. I’m not on the computer atm but I believe they have their own “classic” version of the mod now.
---
Would you support removing damage numbers from the game entirely? I consider a lack of mob health to be an oversight by the dev team and the way I see it, if you support the idea that mob health should just be a percentage, then your own abilities should not have known damage values. "Hit shit til it dies", right? It makes it a more skillful game, no?
---
I'm not using healbot and I'm not using anything to tell me what to do. I literally just want to have enough data to decide between eviscerate and refreshing slice and dice. I know what kind of damage those abilities do, but I do not know how much damage the enemy can take. That doesn't make any sense.
---
I can't name one RPG where you can't see mob health other than final fantasy and that's actually part of the progression, where you eventually unlock enemy health bars. WoW doesn't actually have a system for learning info about the enemy(like DnD), so I don't see how hiding the information is consistent.
---
And a lich king
---
they could always allow server transfers, i think that would have been the better move.
---
Just a side note, you don't have to learn every new spell on level up, some are going to be fairly useless for you right now so only pick the ones that you're going to use/ are beneficial for you right now.

It's not, though, Blizzard wants to phase it out by Phase 2, and even originally wanted it only for the launch period. One whole phase duration is an extremely long time for people to abuse early economies.

---
What you don't do is make a post about how much of a failure he is because he upset you. This is next level weird
---
Don’t know if it’s been fixed, but AAP has some really awful bugs in it right now. Might give it a while to work out the kinks.
---
Server populations are many times higher than what they were in vanilla launch. I played the second week of vanilla and even layered servers are significantly more packed than Illidan was at launch.
---
logged into netherwind, saw portuguese scrolling in general, logged out
---
But the orcs were corrupted by the blood of demons and evil warlocks etc, turned into raging brutes. Was that really their fault?
---
DM-VC.
---
Your side loses good day sir
---
no it doesn’t.
---
Not at this stage, layering is probably the issue and should make it feel better soon, plus everyone's now spread out leveling. Give it a month or two and you'll be seeing loads of people all the time.
---

At what level do mobs stop dropping linen cloth and go to wool cloth? I’m 18 and on he tailoring grind, but having a hard time advancing because all the mobs I farm are only dropping linen cloth.
---
I did, and I also played the first two as well. Doesn't really change my perspective that the Alliance had pretty good reason to look up the Orcs.
---
Another idea, if they have one-time permanent layer transfers and then disable layer hopping all together?
---
He had whirlwind axe too. Some people are just super entitled to loot they want.

---
Soooooo...is Hitler a thing your guild talk about a lot or...?
---
Right now everybody wants money and are picking up gathering professions, so I'd advice you to keep both mining and engineering for now since you won't make much from skinning at this point, while engineering is the best profession and mining will only get more profitable as the game goes on
---
Do you remember about where you were at gold wise earlier on in levels? I'm a little bit into 29 and have 23-24 gold right now. Have to spend about 5 gold on needed spells at 30, which will leave me around 18 gold right after hitting 30. Curious if you remember your gold amounts prior to 40. I e been skinning from the get go and plan to grind a few levels between now and 40 on beasts, but have otherwise been solo leveling through quests. Congrats on the mount!
---
I considered writing a little about this but decided against it because the post was already long and complicated as it was. There are situations where pre-HoTing the tank can be perfectly okay because the HoT won't actually build aggro on the healer until the *healer* enters combat with the mobs. 
---
So tossing HoTs on the tank if you know you can sit down and drink during the start of the pull and not have to get up and panic heal and enter combat can be a valid tactic, but it requries care, knowledge and probably more faith in the tank than you'll usually have in a random dungeon group.
---
Que pirates of the carribian music
---
Same kind of life, level 17 tho you must be a witch
---
What are your settings? I've yet to run into any fog!
---
I really hope that realm transfers and name changes never come to classic. Back then you built a reputation and bad/toxic players became known so you could avoid them. They couldn't just transfer or name change when their reputation dropped low enough meaning there were social consequences for being a ninja looter or something equally awful.
---
I’m a mage, I buff everyone I pass and offer food/water to those who buff back if they can,  and food/water to those who can’t if they acknowledge the buff. Classic is a community that needs each other, the grind is hard so whatever we can do to make it easier for each other is what we should do
---
I, too, look up to people with mold in their room for months.
---
Good boy
---
yeah, kind of a shitty way to waste peoples time.
---
Elaborate please
---
In the 14 years i've been playing the game i can count the amount of friends i made in it on one hand. That said I met all of them in raiding. Im trying to meet people in classic by grouping with them and helping them but it never goes anywhere after that

I'd say it's the best music in the game too
---
Seems like this breaks rule 7 *eyeroll*
---
Dps probably the easiest. You only have 1 healer and 1 tank in a 5 man, so if you're playing either of those roles and you fuck up you'll probably wipe.
---
If 1 Dps player isn't that good it'll just mean you progress through the instance a bit slower, but the other 2 Dps should still be able to carry you.

Interesting that they nerfed it right after the world first competition. Why are we seeing no bans or roll backs for those who exploited this bug? If this happened in retail we would see people banned, just look at preach recently with the xp potion exploit. 
---
I find it a bit suspicious that they nerfed this almost immediately after the competition ends. Almost like they didnt mind streamers exploiting, but us average Joe's with jobs and lives dont get the same advantage. Kinda like they want us to be logged in longer than we usually would be.
---
Yeah I getcha, I'll keep that in mind before I post next time. My bad!
---
I experienced my first node-napper again today. I turn off auto loot for node just in case. We shared some laughs and gestures, I wasted a couple minutes of his time, that's all I could have hoped for.
---
So
---
Try to make them attack one mob, that way you can leave it, build aggro on the other mobs, and then taunt the dps mob back if it's still alive. That's how I usually do it. 
---
The real annoying thing is dps that insist on pulling. If I don't get the initial threat I'm almost useless as a tank, I need them to hit me to get rage so I can do anything.

The Twitch add-on client search literally doesn't work that well. Sometimes it just doesn't return matches, even for known results. The most reliable method is usually using the actual name of the addon.

Hypothetically say that the Orcs were 100% tricked into being corrupted and were by no means complicit (which is debatable) - does this mean that the Alliance is going to give them the benefit of the doubt? I really don't think so.
---
not rly, why?
---
This is poor advise, there are lots of spells that are not useful.  
---
As a shaman I definitely don’t need sentry totem, and hunters definitely don’t need eagle eye.  
---
You can get them later on once getting money is easier and miss nothing
---
Understood, thank you very much.
---
Hopefully they never get a better weapon than Thunderstrike.

Pulling aggro 
---
Aggro means that an enemy mob gets aggresive and attacks you. 
---
You can get aggro by walking to close to an enemy or attacking it. 
---
If you attack a mob you build a resource called threat. High damage = high threath. The more threath you build the more the mob wants to attack you. 
---
Tanks have a lot of threath building abilities (some do damage and threath, other only threath.) If the tank have more threath than you, then the mob will focus the tank while you damage the mob. 
---
When you pull aggro, your threath resource surpasses the tanks and the mob will start attacking you. 
---
The better tank you have the more you can damage the mob.
---
Lighten up dude

I've put every BoE that I don't need onto the AH so far. Something like 95% of them sell within 24 hours. Doesn't need to be over priced to get you more money than vendoring.
---
No, don't rush to 60. The game is just as enjoyable getting to Max level. (I enjoy it more than raiding).
---
ofc also you can level gathering proffesions while stockpiling mats. I'm leveling skinning/mining while stockpiling mats for tailoring and engineering on one alt each.
---
It's funny, I'm playing horde with my husband but alliance on a PvP server just for me, switching gears is weird lol
---
I stand corrected. Happy vanillaing!
---
Me :)
---
This is brilliant xD
---
What? You are completely misunderstanding the concern - the concern isn't the amount of mats it's the control of those materials. If one guild can control an entire supply they can price gouge and suffocate the server.
---
I love playing WoW but after a while, I feel like I’ve wasted time that could be used to do stuff around the house or studying/learning stuff for work.
---
Give your balls a zug
---
Pug and join a guild. I grouped with 2 random people in Mulgore Friday for some quests and we spent the rest of the night questing together, playing over the weekend, etc. Not everyone will want to be your friend (just like real life) but it will happen eventually
---
I'm still looking for Gaycory on Herod
