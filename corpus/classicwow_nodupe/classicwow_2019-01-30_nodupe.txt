Dear mages, if you have a priest in your group kindly stay the fuck away from grabbing wands that are upgrades for them. I see your every action and you have not casted wand once in the two hours we have been in this hellhole of an dungeon. Thanks.
---
---
---
&gt; I have no problem with the old models, but I love the newer models.
---

---
Same. Late in Legion I played a night elf hunter that was left abandoned since Vanilla @ level 34.
---
Gotta say, NElf run animation got some hips.
---
I like the extra light. I don't remember vanilla being so dark.
---
Troll is better against melee classes since their racial can proc blackout. Troll is better in group fights because they can hex enemies with a spammable -healing effect, a mini-mortal strike.
---
Troll also get berserking but that's only good for mind blast, however every .5 sec in PvP counts.
---
Undead is literally only better vs warlocks and warrior fear, or when their 3 min CD DoT is off cooldown. 
---
Yep makes sense for a big ominous cavern system filled with nightmare dinos.
---
It won’t affect the economy in classic at all, unless I’m missing something. The only difference it makes is that a very few amount of people will be playing for “free”. The economy on retail will suffer, however, for the gold price of WoW tokens will most likely skyrocket. This is assuming they don’t add wow tokens to classic. 
---
The pre dungeon area before Maraudon is more complex than some post cata dungeons.
---
AVAST YE SWABS
---
Nope. Wouldn’t give a fuck if you had my character looking like a pink elephant in a clown costume.
---
Don’t get why people have an issue with what others see. As long it provides no advantage I don’t get why it’s bad to let others use different models.
---
Honestly Classic should be Blizzards love note to the OG community, not the current ones who expect content to be shoveled to them every 2 months.  We want the quality we used to expect from a Blizzard product.  Releasing when its ready instead of as fast as possible to give the playerbase something to do.
---
[Gravestone Scepter](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7001/gravestone-scepter#comments) is your main priority. It does insane damage for it's level, it's easily a level 29 wand but it's a reward from a level 19 dungeon.
---
Both Alliance and Horde frequently run this dungeon, Horde has a nearby flight point and Paladins need to run it as part of their class quest.
---
A bug that only happened in the first few weeks of the game? Then again in the last few weeks?
---
Huh? Ok...
---
The problem with non-instanced housing is that you'd need a scalable, automated system to continue to grow the number of players houses as the number of home owners increase. This would make this "zone" look cookie cutter and repetitive. 
---
As for tying it to Grand Marshall: big ole' nope. I have big problems with the Vanilla PVP system. Grand Marshall =/= skill due to how it's purely a farming game. Those players who no life (speaking honestly) to R14 are already rewarded with the best weapons in the game (well, some of).
---
Bottom line: housing adds nothing because frankly they're not interactive in a game like WoW. See: Garrisons.
---
people who say that don't understand the appeal of classic and they never will
---
I had a feral druid alt on a private server and they were my farming character (Herbalism and Mining).  You have stealth so you can get to those nodes/chests behind elite packs of mobs.  You are pretty efficient at farming mobs for Elemental Fire or Larval Acid or whatever.  You can escape from any pvp situation if you get jumped.  You have effective CC (roots) for beating a different faction to the node or keeping a mob busy while you hit up a node.
---
I also tanked 5 man dungeons and some ZG AQ20 offtanking.  I was 11/31/7, a pretty standard feral spec.  Other people will probably adress other aspect of your question, but I wanted to point out how good of a gatherer they make.
---
You can find players from top guilds and check out their runs. You are right tho, not all guilds did ALL of the things I mention above ( I bet they almost all full world buff/flasked/consumed for first week BWL though). I am just listing many of the characteristics of the guilds that are clearing BWL on first week that distinguish them from typical players. It isn't the norm. 
---
A lot of people did stop. Some people kept on with clears for leveling gear (all our healers ended up with a pretty good DPS set), Legendaries (gotta keep clearing MC), and trinkets that actually remained BiS for a while into TBC, like Rejuv Gem. I know several other guilds that did the same, but it did vary from guild to guild and server to server. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Name and shame them and move on.
---
How can you name and shame them if you dont know its going on?
---
AQ20 is a feral druid paradise as far as loot, if you can't get good stuff in 40 man raids for whatever reason.  Just FYI.
---
&gt; Paladins need to run it as part of their class quest.
---
Paladins only need to kill some naga by the entrance. Most don't do a legit run.
---
Jadefire masters lets you cheese the wall mechanic by running to the right of the aoe. :&gt;)
---
I think you're missing the thesis of what I'm saying. If Diablo and WoW are similar genres to you, you ARE lying about having played vanilla. Diablo is a fast-paced isometric action looter with light RPG mechanics. You dodge around aoe and spam 5 buttons. Same with modern wow. No class fantasy, no real utility, you're a rat in a skinner box. 
---
When I leveled to max at the start of BFA, again, it was piss easy. Heirlooms are still in the game, so is LFD. Never got one-shotted because I was the HERO OF AZEROTH and all that shit. Spells are no thought babymode and every class is homogenized into either ranged dps, melee dps, healer or tank. Those are the 4 classes. I was lucky to see "Stabbyz - Tichondrius" while leveling. Who is this asshole? 
---
'Challenge' is a lot different now than it was back then. During the Roman civil war, Caesar built a 30km wall around Pompey's fortifications in around 2 weeks. Is that twitch gameplay? No. Was it difficult and challenging? Yes. Vanilla raids were tedious, required more consumables than today's raids, required management of 40 people, required attunements, Onyxia scale cloaks, long corpse runs, etc. The trash between Twin Emps and C'thun would respawn and wipe your raid again. Tedious and fucking brutal, albeit not as mechanically complex as modern raids. 
---
Four horseman required something like 8 FULLY GEARED WARRIOR TANKS. Do you have any idea how much work it was to gear a single tank? Guilds would poach and that led to drama. Caesar's wall didn't require his men to play simon says midair, it required extreme patience and dedication and was a difficult task regardless. 
---
None of your arguments also have addressed the fact that community is dead because of CRZ. Reckful quit. Bellular said he isn't really playing anymore because guilds are falling apart left and right. Sub numbers have dropped dramatically. (Blizzard hasn't released them since wod because they aren't good), Asmongold is doing variety streaming mostly now because the game sucks and nobody cares. 
---
Look, I get it. Sometimes you want that dopamine fix without putting in the work. Sometimes you don't want to be immersed in a believable RPG. Sometimes thinking hurts your head. Being a cat in a skinner box is fun. Just buy the new store mount and drink more Coca Cola(TM)!
---
I'm guessing Hu-hu-ran would be a fight to innervate a shaman maybe?  Need those chain heals near the end of the fight.
---
"Hey man, I heard you ran brd for the 248th time and lost the roll against me for hand of justice? Wanna buy it for 300g or something? I've got 2 since i wanted to try if they stacked."
---
the world buff should go away on death
---
You can easily heal the instance as Priest right at 18 if the group is good enough. For Warlocks and the rest it is a bit tougher.
---
Everyone says troll is better for berserking and sure for pure healing numbers, in niche situations it's better. But lets look at taurens and warstomp. 
---
Warstomp aoe stuns all non-boss mobs for 2 seconds. In 5 mans it outshines berserking hands down, because while you're not directly healing, that's 2 secs of no damage from elite mobs to your party. It's 2 seconds that you can cast a freebie heal where this is minimal or no damage occurring to your tank and is usable every 90 seconds.
---
Warstomp can be used in PvP to much greater effect than berserking. If you're at low hp you get a free heal off whereas with berserking if you at low hp you're most likely going to get interrupted anyway and it's utterly pointless. Warstomp is also crucial to interrupt PvP casters while you wait for other interrupts to come off of cooldown (earth shock, warrior pummel for example)
---
Tauren extra HP can be the difference between you dying or not dying. Admittedly, berserking can mean the difference between the tank dying or not, but often times it can just end up going to waste if your heals get sniped anyway.
---
TLDR: Warstomp is better than berserking for 5mans, raid trash, boss adds, and in PvP. Berserking is really only better if you're doing solely PvE raid boss content or if you're not being focused in PvP.
---
My buddy played an orc rogue in vanilla, and this is exactly what his experience was
---
It's very true. There are guilds on private servers that clear BWL in 30 min in BWL gear. They've played this vanilla race for like 5+ years on different servers. They know everything by heart and just no life it. They are not a representation for even 1% of the classic population.
---
&gt;Jadefire masters lets you cheese the wall mechanic by running to the right of the aoe. :&gt;)
---
Thats not the kick and thats not cheesing thats getting out of the breath.

Not D1 or D2. Those even had OG Talent trees, And yes I played in vanilla I was a Forsaken Warlock that went Engineering and Cloth for goggles and robes and Camped SFK because I liked the dungeon.
---

Only because no one fucking new what they were doing.

Your moving the goalpost. We werent talking about sub loss, or server communitys, or people quitting.
---
&gt;Look, I get it. Sometimes you want that dopamine fix without putting in the work. 
---
Shut the fuck up. Your condescending attitude isn't helpful WHEN I WAS FUCKING PLAYING VANILLA AND TBC. Jesus fucking christ dude.
---
REPEL THE INVADERS!!!
---
I legit forgot about old VC I’m so hyped now holy shit
---
Because your money tastes delicious 
---
I highly doubt Blizzard will include a world chat that is accessible from anywhere in the world. It goes against their intention of recreating the Vanilla social experience.   
---
Oh I've been waiting to be able to say this...
---
NO CHANGES!
---
Feels good, screw global chat.
---
Definitely Hunter or Druid.
---
Right it is possible, but most priests probably aren't going to be doing BFD at lvl 18. They're still doing WC/Deadmines. Anyone who is trying to minmax for leveling efficiency might have some guildies help them through it, but I'm mostly speaking about the masses who either don't know about it, or aren't super concerned with getting the wand immediately.
---
They can't be made with the new api.
---
It will probably still happen. Someone will inevitably make a /world chat channel even if by accident and a lot of people will join it and use it to chat.
---
Spread them out in the world, have something that is needed kind of often enough, like guild bank in the guild housing. Let players set their heartstone directly into the house that your guild controlls. Have guilds pvp for the different housings and have long and costly quests to maintain said housing, they could add insanely fun things like "join X amount of MC raids with atleast half not being from your own guild" or "raid the crossroads and kill a spawned boss there". 
---
Most places could house a guild housing, it would add a lot of life into some of the lesser used areas and camps. Goldshire would be really cool to have a few and perhaps some remote ones aswell? Balancing is key here as some locations will be hotspots compared to others. 
---
Ad a private housig for high warlord or R12 purchasable, perhaps you can challange some for their housing depending on which housing it is? perhaps some other rolling accomplishment could be allow some aswell like: "Win atleast X amount of fishing competitions"
---
Perhaps owning a private house instead of a guild house gives you another smaller bank, you can hopefully display armors and weapons on different displays.
---
They all come in different sizes, needs, locations but dont take from the world, instead gives with either guildbank or something else for private housing.
---
Make sure they are burnable so the other faction can raid guild homes and private citizens. Of course not taking any loot besides a token smal %, like 1-2 or even lesswith a cd on burning down again on a few days.
---
And if you had a rogue with lockpick/blacksmith with a skeleton key you could avoid that initial rush of people as soon as you burst the doors. 
---
The  Goblin Jumper Cables was the item that got me interested.  I remember the first time I saw them used!
---
Was there not a low limit on the number of players able to join a channel on retail?
---
Honestly there's plenty of unoccupied "houses" in the world. Plenty inc cities and some out in the world. Especially if you're an RPer I'd suggest claiming one of these. 
---
It always come across as people lobbying from r/wow to push things. You lads know full well the aesthetics and the artstyle of the old game is very, VERY, different to what we have now which is borderline capeshit. 
---
[https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1811](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1811)
---
I don't think so. I really havn't explored the chat channel function of the game much at all.
---
Repel the invaders!
---
Just curious, how do people think this content is supposed to be implemented? My understanding was that in order for Classic to come fruition, Blizzard didn't want to dedicate any manpower to creating content, only to getting a previous iteration compatible with today's client and hardware. 
---
I've always assumed if anything, they'd roll out expansions after maybe a year or 2. Do people think they may approach additional content differently?
---
Absolutely worth it, and I saw this as somebody who started out and didn't really pvp much their first few characters. The constant threat of pvp adds a whole additional layer of immersion to being out in the world. Some days you'll log in planning to get some quests busted out and end up spending the whole day fighting for territory with the opposing faction, and it will be a blast.
---
Pvp also helps build a much stronger community. Often there's minimal incentive to group, and some types of quests like collection quests are slower in a group. However on pvp servers, it always makes sense to group up just to protect you from the possible ganks.
---
People well tell you that there's tons of bullshit on pvp servers, lvl 60s camping you in Redridge, people only willing to fight when you're at 10% hp, and their 100% correct. It's up to you to decide if the extra immersion is worth the bullshit.
---
I'm sorry I went full baby mode and didn't reply to you like an adult. I do not deserve the patience you put into your posts.
---
It's not a question whether you want it or you don't. 
---
It will be a user-made chat channel like /lookingforgroup or /world and there is nothing you can do about it besides ignoring its existence.
---
Not having 15FPS in raids and 4:3 square screen is probably a bigger "change" than players cooperating to create a chat for everyone by using built-in game functionality.
---
Early game +mana is a larger boost, because if you only have +50 healing on your gear that 10% is only a +5 healing boost vs +500 mana or whatever it turns out to be. 
---
Late game that +10% healing is an extra 50-75 +healing and by then you'll have better mp5/spirit gear so the mana isn't as big of a deal.
---
I will attack anyone that's within honor range, but I usually give them a chance to prepare.  If they're killing a mob, I'll walk up to them and point and threaten then let them eat.  
---
&gt; Would you have an issue if I used a client side mod to make your character a naked night elf with my favorite hair and skin color?
---
Nope, none at all. 
---
As long as I see my character as I want it to be, I don't care what anyone else sees. Because how I don't see anyone else's screen, only my own. So my only experience with the game (at least concerning visuals) is what the game looks like for me. What others choose in their client does not affect my experience at all. 
---
Nothing wrong with robes. Wizards wear robes and they are badass.
---
This is my route. 
---
Not necessary, they can prevent it. Some rare private servers managed to prevent world chat. And like I said they may have had a player limit on chats on retail.
---
It's a big change no matter what. You can trade anywhere, group for any dungeon, any quests anywhere, replace quitting party members in no time etc.
---
Also it pretty much kills zone chats, noone use those anymore.
---
If you are Orc, you don't have Blessing of Freedom. I think you are jumping on the Horde train a little too fast there. Paladin + Warrior OP
---
Why do anything when it all comes to an end eventually? 
---
I personally play (I guess played since I don't plan on returning to retail) on ED and I personally believe the RPPvP server we get will have a similar community. ED used to be much different ages ago, and has kind of settled down now, but I'm sure a lot of the role playing aspects will be revitalized. 
---
Race should help where you are weakest. Alliance racials were never weaker. People just didn't roll Dwarves. Worst race in PVP is troll in a landslide. 
---
Rogue : Dwarf. Weak against poison, bleeds preventing restealths. Can win rogue mirror due to getting out of rogue blind. Runner up Orc.
---
Mage : Undead. Good Locks are a pain in the arse. Runner up. Gnome. Escaping a shatter in mage mirrors is nice.
---
Warrior : Orc. Weak against kiting or being kept from target. Runner up Gnome.
---
Priest Tie between Undead and Dwarf. Dwarf is better but Undead doesn't have to deal with purge so they are pretty even.
---
Paladin : Dwarf. Getting out of rogue blind is nice for any spec. Probably strongest as a healer where you are basically immune to a very strong CC. Removing bleeds is a bonus as warriors are a popular class and you are going to have them on you a lot. 
---
Druid : Tauren. Warstomp is better than basically nothing since druids can stealth.
---
Hunter : Tie. Dwarf and Orc. Dwarf gets you out of rogue slows and blind. Orc resists stuns.
---
Shaman : Orc for all specs or classes is never bad. Tauren is as good or better imo for Elemental.
---
Lock : Orc
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think there was a limit of like 100 people per chat channel, but I don't remember, BUT there was 100% a limit. 
---
In classic in the US. PvP and PvE were about 50/50 guys. There was a literal almost even split, the only difference were there were more PvE servers because some of the PvE servers were insanely overpopulated.
---
By the time they removed server designations in favor of Warmode for BFA the PvE servers were slightly in the lead for population above PvP servers. But for years they were about nearly even:
---
https://realmpop.com/us.html
---
You can get your server pops and names at that link and cross reference the data with the server types and names from Wiki. All in all, in the US, pretty even, in EU however it appears it was closer to a 60% 40% split with more players being PvP.
---
If you're trying to be ahead of the curve, forget warrior.  While it may not be as bad as some say, the leveling isn't the best.  If you wanna be fast druid and hunter are great, from that point I'd decide what you want to do once you hit 60 to make your decision. 
---
I think you are going to be surprised. Saying PvP will have a higher pop is 100% based on private server data. The PvE scene is wildly underrepresented in the private server scene. Don't be surprised when it leans PvE in the US... It did right before BFA took away PvP and PvE servers.
---
Did warfronts &amp; phasing kill Wpvp on ED? How do they even setuo fights or randon fights happen anymore
---
Why invest any time in anything or there’s a risk that investment might not produce the desired result? 
---
For Classic to become its own independent branch game it would almost quite literally need to pull the exact same patter it did when it launched back in 04. Near constant growth over time to the point it overshadows the live servers. Basically a full paradigm shift in blizzard games and players to make Classic the most succesful MMO again.
---
If that happens though, why would they go with new things? They have an entire catalog that sucked the numbers up higher in TBC and Wrath? Whats the hook of suddenly slamming tons of devlopment into Classic which may not be something the sudden masses want.
---
Shit dwarf model was ugly. Retail dwarfs was definitely one of the winners of the wod rework. 
---
But which wand type makes the best attack sound? For me, that's shadow.
---
I haven't seen a set up fight in a while. Once in a blue moon an RP event would occur in Org, but incredibly rare. 
---
World pvp was 100% prevalent, but people can just leave your phase, or sometimes you'll enter a new area and be phased somewhere completely different than the alliance you were just fighting.
---
Warfronts is sort of like an instance so it had no effect.
---
Pvp us the reason to play the game 
---
If you have death coil up you should win. Succubus when DC is on CD because with a void you'll almost never get the first fear off because of their interrupts. 
---
The last time i played retail it was in WoD and wpvp was stikk tons of fun then on ED. Has it really died on ed?
---
Go play BFA. You ruined the modern game and now you want to ruin Classic. **Why should Blizzard listen to all your whining when you are the ones who cried for impossible balance, then refuse to even play the modern game you helped create? You clowns will never be happy and will always blame "balance" for being bad at the game.**
---
Either play BFA or don't play MMO's. 
---
Orc is 100% better when you're fighting other rogues.
---
1. If you're a melee class then enemy warrior charge/intercept isn't really much of an issue. 
---
2. If a paladin stuns you, they don't really deal much damage anyway and if a paladin wants to heal you can really do anything about it anyway since they have bubble.
---
3.Useful against druid opener or bear bash, but stun resistance isn't going to make or break the fight here especially since theres still a 75% chance you'll get stunned anyway. A good druid won't die to anyone anyway.
---
4. Bm hunter stun, you're probably getting killed from bestial wrath anyway until AQ/naxx gear so stun resistance still doesn't matter.
---
5. Iron grenades - anyone Pvping with these is probably min/maxxing and already knows who they can or can't kill with relative ease, and they're going to choose their battles wisely. If a min-maxxing try hard is fighting you, then he believes he's going to win anyway, because not many people jump into a battle they don't expect to win.
---
Stun resistance is good, but it's not a game changer like it is with escape artist for gnomes
---
Lmfao, so fucking true! I remember way back when before I had a twin and I would select the opposing faction with my pointer, see their portrait and those bright-green goggles and see they're headed right to me... At that point I accepted my death.
---
All the down votes for this is the funniest thing I've seen in a while.
---
It's not that it's died off, its that phasing has screwed it. On occassion you will get in some nice battles but 60% of the time it won't even be someone from ED 
---
I'm illustrating the poor direction the game has gone in by elucidating to you how both neckbeards and casual players have abandoned the game. If it wasn't shit, it stands to reason that people would still pay for it. If it wasn't shit, people wouldn't have campaigned so hard for vanilla. Asmongold is a withered dweller who has spent the last 13 years of his life eating ramen and playing wow and he's said that it's gotten SO bad that he'd rather play dark souls. That's an opinion I can respect. 
---
Pressing a button and conjuring food =/= gearing a warrior tank. Again, doubt you played back then. I get that it's convenient to be a lying Andy to attempt to give yourself legs to stand on but you just look like a dumbass when someone checks you on it. EVERYONE needed an Onyxia cloak to kill nefarian, meaning you're looking at 15-20 Onyxia kills just to attempt the boss. Wasn't because they sucked back then. Look up Onyxia attunements ontop of that. 
---
For certain bis/resistance gear, you had to kill the world dragons which were under fierce competition. Guilds would have scouts posted literally 24/7 at their spawns. There were cross-faction treaties and agreements, waiting lists, the top guilds would decide which guilds under them they would allow to kill the boss. 80 player wars in Duskwood over a pixel dragon. THAT sounds like a god damn MMORPG, not this pansy shit we have now. 
---
Combine that with having to endlessly farm resistance gear (materials for it) which did NOT come easy for 40 + GOD DAMN PEOPLE. What the fuck man. Shit was nuts. Took a TON of shitsocking. Wanna become a scarab lord? Prepare to be a degenerate
---
It's obvious you can't handle a little banter, maybe cause you're on the spectrum or you just internalize everything, I feel you fam, nothing personnel :&gt;) Just don't think too hard about it
---
Oh my God such a simple solution! I can't believe it's never been posted here before, EVER! Good job. Blizzard take note and hire this very creative person ASAP.
---
Yes, it sounds cool with the world pvp of old but this is actually the reality. 
---
Me and my wife was 55 when the pvp patch hit and no battle grounds, we ended up in brd all trough 55-60 as it was 100% completely impossible to keep any kind of speed as they farmed you for gold. 
---
I really feelt like a mob that day. They kind of knew our respawn timer (running back) and just dropped by, slammed us down and continued on to murder other hapless lowbies. Our own faction spent their time doing the same just in different areas. The different factions avoided eachother to take on the easier pray.
---
Ok well I'm a drunk trashcan and I've led &lt;Entitled&gt; to clear it on six servers opening wekeend. If you try, you'll clear  it.
---
Right? I think it's hilarious that people are down voting an opinion lol
---
If you’re addressing this to me, then FYI I’ve never played BFA. 
---
I played Vanilla, TBC and Wrath. I stopped playing at the start of Cataclysm when I realised I didn’t recognise the game anymore. This wasn’t due to classes being overbalanced. It was because the Azeroth I loved was ruined. Plus LFG, Heirlooms, flying mounts, transmog, achievements and other stuff felt like they had no place in the proper WoW experience.
---
You're humble edit made me lol, take an upvote.
---
I think the big point here is that the vast majority of Classic players will not be the people who have raided BWL on 6 different private servers. 
---
I am not really saying it's hard or easy to clear or accomplish this task. I am saying that &gt;90% of people on private servers aren't killing Nef on opening week. 
---
Sure but zg being out isnt going to bump that number up.
---
&gt;ZG makes a big difference imo. Maybe not for BWL initial clear times, but for gearing up players in general. ZG just hands gear that is better than prebis to any 60 that joins a PuG.  It makes the early end game too easy and basically lets you avoid a ton of dungeon runs.
---
I'll just quote myself since it seems like you didn't read it :p
---
Hahaha that was great
---
I wasn't even aware parts were missing. Is this true for other dungeons too?
---
&gt; Every 1.12.1 client I've played on and had the privilege to dissect has had this issue. Maybe it is just private servers that have suffered the unfortunate neglect from it's owners and isn't an issue in blizzard's official source code. 
---
Loot has nothing to do with the client. The game is the server.
---
Uh, you're getting lots of changes..
---
The big ones are LOOT SHARING (!) And SHARDING
---
#NoChanges got blown the fuck out long ago 
---
Queen Mico
---
Pink Sparkles
---
Destinyfomo
---
Lot's of diversity there and they know as much about WoW as the OP's list full of Blizzard influencers. Exception would be Frostadamus who appears to have some good advice on professions and Kargoz who is more a theorycrafter who has some wrong info due to private server experience. Example. Rogue frontstabbing. He still has good lists for weapons and leveling rotations though. It's really all you need and he has the docs in his information setting under the vids.
---
You are simply going to learn to play the game while playing it. It's a LONG road to 60 and 5 mans are harder than the first two tiers of nerfed to hell raids due to all the changes that the Blizzard influencers call no changes. By the time you get BIS pre raid you will be better than what is required to do anything until AQ. So relax.
---
People who play Orc for PvP are bad at the game. Stun res is nothing but a lootbox. 
---
Oh definitely 
---
This def inspires me to roll Tauren hunter in classic 
---
So will the phasing stay like this forever? Will classic be able to hold oldtime wpvp battles that ED used to have?
---
If you play Orc you're low skill and will lose even to the worst rogues.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=10503/rose-colored-goggles
---
If phasing is removed from Classic, then yes
---
It won't die quickly. It will likely bring back thousands of not more old players with loyalty to when blizzard didn't pander to people who can't figure out how to install add-ons. Most of the new players probably won't like it that much, but what's that anyway... 400 people? Who even plays retail?
---
What are you talking about?
---
But a global LFG chat existed as of 1.11 and forward. So it sounds like you do want changes.
---
I'm in full agreement with this and all the other people making excellent theorycrafting points.
---
The difference here is theory versus practice. Most players don't carry jungle remedies. Getting in a 1v1 versus a warrior or rogue, which are the two classes with the highest potential for pushing a Horde spriest's shit in, is where DP can become an auto-win. Starting a fight with 1/3rd of my mana against a hunter would otherwise be game over. Over and over DP saves my ass.
---
Its weakness is indeed dispels. I completely agree. Its strength lies in winning those fights that would otherwise spell major trouble. Very few players carry the proper consume counters.
---

---
I play on ED and I'm certain it will cater to folks like us. 
---
Makes me sad 😪
---
What people seem to not grasp is that World of Warcraft in the growth period wasn't considered improving from patch to patch by the entire playerbase. The subscriber numbers increased because as the game got more popular, even more people heard of it and got interested in playing the game until the peak (in subscribers) in WotLK. You can't just make the assumption that everyone up until that point thought the game was constantly improving.
---
For me the first month of having a flying mount in TBC was all about stress relief, yeah, this new form of travel was good, made farming alot easier, just dive down, mine what you needed and fly off without aggroing anything! For about a month, then it hit me when the need for me to farm decreased, that flying ruined the immersion of the game for me. And slowly I started to loose interest in the game. Still played through most of WotLK... and been dabbling in different later expansions aswell.
---
Guess I've gone off the trail with trying to make my point, but sub numbers doesn't equal game quality in my mind. The slippery slope started way before the decline in subscribers.
---
Oh almost forgot. For the Glory of the Ironsworn Regiment!
---
Bit of a disingenuous comment. "lots of changes" lol...
---
Loot sharing was part of Classic, you just had to do it through a ticket. You can argue that it's not exactly the same because it's not being manually done by a game master, but that's still a flimsy example.
---
Sharding is for starter zones for shortly after release exclusively, and it's only for splitting up singular realms and not multiple realms, and this is specifically to maintain long-term server populations. Blizzard have confirmed it won't be used for areas in which it would significantly mess up game dynamics which are important to Classic (Including profession nodes beyond start zones, world bosses etc). Again, a flimsy example.
---
&gt; you'd need a scalable, automated system to continue to grow the number of players houses as the number of home owners increase.
---
This is a misconception that actually is relatable to real-life. As the population of a city increases, the answer to "we need more housing" sometimes is not actually "let's build more houses". That is, unless you want your city to [look like this](https://cdn2.miragestudio7.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/mexico_urban_sprawl_city_mass_housing.jpg). That involves politics of course, but that's besides the point.
---
In vanilla wow there's probably like... ~100 suitable in-game houses that already exist. Houses that don't have any occupants that could be retrofitted into some sort of player housing system. Meaning all the houses are scattered over azeroth. You might be like, ~100 houses... 2500-4000 players... ??? And that's the point -- having a house would be a super luxury. Maybe each big guild could afford to have one. Super rich people might have one too. Ownership constantly changing to prevent people from holding one for too long.
---
But yeah I agree I don't like the scalable model because that would just make no sense. You'd what... enter a zone called Player Housing Zone and just see thousands upon thousands of [these](https://pm1.narvii.com/6242/4b822992d9e6ea324eeab1ed3ebfe1a4d16ad64c_hq.jpg) all in a line? That would be horrible.
---
&gt; A-Tier: Enh Shaman
---
&gt; B-Tier: Ret Paladin
---
&gt; C-Tier: Hunters
---
Putting enhances on the same tier as ele is laughable. Ditto for putting rets above hunters when they get kited by everyone and their mother.
---
ZG buff does not disappear on death
---
I must have missed where he said "need" or "greed". If you think it is in there, can you give us a timestamp? Because I think he said nothing about it either way.
---
MC cap is out of combat only and backfires alot of the time, especially vs casters.
---
I'm having SUCH flashbacks now... good times
---
carrot on a stick was so wildly popular!!
---
There's no such thing as "overall best PVP" class/race combo or class because there's way too many aspects of PVP. There's duels, BGs and WPVP. Some classes are gods in duels and/or WPVP but suck ass in BGs (lol rogues). 
---
This list just like every other "best overall PVP" list is subjective and useless. There's no point in having this discussion because there's no discussion to be had in the first place.
---
Ever since they redid the character creation screen, I have to go to like option 9 or 10 just to look anything like my asian ass.
---
Well, sounds more weirder to complain about when I type it out..
---
Except we are linked to modern WoW. The whole reason for the sharding debacle is dealing with the low barrier to entry that inclusion with a Live sub will have on a massive influx of tourists. The best answer to healthy server populations is treating Classic as it's own game with a separate box cost and separate sub. However since rolling Classic in with Live allows them to sneakily insert WoW tokens into Classic without really ruining Classic means there's basically no way we're getting Blizz to disentangle the two.
---
Since you dont even know that Dwarf Paladin is for removing Blind, I'm not even going to take your seriously, becuase that is very basic PvP knowledge.
---
Right, when theorycrafting I usually assume that everyone is full hp/mana, aware of the other person's existence and at max range, and no consumables. Take into account only base skills, abilities, and mechanics that are available. If someone starts mention consumables then you have to assume both people in this 1v1 have the same, i.e. both have swiftness potions or free action, iron grenades etc. 
---
Assuming you only PvP vs alliance (not counting same faction duels) you have pallies, priests, and all dwarves that can dispel it. If I had to pull a random number out of my butthole I'd say that's about 30% of alliance players overall where its futile to use. 
---
Though one could argue that troll racials are only useful vs melee and healers where a healer is probably going to lose the battle anyway.
---
Ultimately using Plague to thanos snap someone out of existence does feel a lot better than the occasional blackout stun and heal redux so I can't really argue the fun factor.
---
Blessing of Freedom doesn't make you immune to stuns, try again.
---
Also I'm talking about what I said in my post, overall the best. You cant put Warrior high up just because they are good when they have a healer following them, every class is good with that lol.
---
I think it feels like it's just adding ANOTHER gimmick to a bad gimmick that is being added on a 15 year old game.
---
&gt; I don't want it cause it was not in vanilla and if it was at some point it was for a short time.
---
The classic arguing from ignorance. Global chat (aka LookingForGroup) was a thing from patch 1.11 onwards. Just because it wasn't used on your server doesn't mean it wasn't used on other servers. If you don't like it, you can stick to trade and miss out on half the groups.
---
&gt; I don't want it cause it makes everything easier,
---
Taking 20 minutes instead of 90 minutes to find a group doesn't make the dungeon magically easier.
---
&gt; the chat is cluttered.
---
Then you can just leave the channel or actually manage your chat windows so that your guild/raid/whispers are in their own tabs and that the trade/world/general spam are in another.
---
&gt; Going back to the capital city to recruit a new group member when one has left was part of the vanilla experience. 
---
So was going to the only city that had an AH.
---
You cant look at the races only, you have to look at the whole picture. If you play Dwarf you are Alliance, which means you have to fight Orcs often in PvP. They can resist your stuns a lot and you are way more screwed as a Rogue.
---
I think Monster Hunter Tri went in the right direction, allowing rare decorations to be selected and put on show for other players to come see.
---
The problem is, in that game there's no reason to visit someones house. It just feels like a waste of time. Most likely because of the main goal of the game being more gameplay driven, and the loading times/screens of having to move over to your house.
---
Buddy. I'm not time stamping shit. Do your research and stfu.
---
show me where in the [patchnote](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.11.0)
---
It would have been so much easier to use the old client. Rebuilding Vanilla in a modern client was a really strange decision IMO.
---
I think this idea of expanding yet never raising the level cap, is just as limiting.
---
Because no matter how small you make those power creeps, I feel like you get a point where there's just too many layers, and not enough progress. 
---
Won't we get to a point where I'm 5 raids above Naxx, yet my armor is arguably not too far off AQ40 gear?
---
What game has been in a similar situation to WoW but approached it this way, and has gone on for many years?
---
It's easier to maintain
---
https://i.imgur.com/2UowRPK.gif
---
Yep, that the worst part of it, the ganksquad will just try to avoid each other, because why risk getting wiped when you can farm all the solo players all day.
---
path of exile is the closest game approach, however, a big part to it's longevity involved league resets. I agree with you on that it is possible for it to be limited. however from what i saw in BC i know there is a LOT of content that can be taken from it and used in a level 1-60 scenario.
---
For instance Jewelcrafting can be includeable, Arena can be a PvP extension to world pvp and battlegrounds, New spells can be droppable consumeable books that teach you it same way we get gift of the wild, arcane brilliance, mage food, ect. new races and levelling newbie places can be included in a 1-60 scenario, class balance can be a thing. Even including 4th trees to each class possibly based off the race you choose. The biggest argument is this type of balance leads to actual expanding. Higher and higher numbers lead to replacement. Replacement will just lead to repetition whereas expanding can improve upon what already exists. (this is the whole path of exile mentality of design)
---
So your saying when its ML to you, you can still trade it.
---
But if you roll need on it by mistake, and win it accidently, you cant trade it? Is this how it works? I think it defeats the purpose of blizzards entire system.
---
&gt; **Only you PvE endgame rushers will be slightly concerned** 
---
Why would I be concerned with something that *strictly* benefits me, if not for it's greater effect on the game? As you said, casuals wouldn't even notice DM's absence, it would be patched in before most hit 60. 
---
DM at launch would be a BOON for hardcore players. Finish my Pre-BiS in a week after hitting 60, acquire MASSIVE amounts of gold, and manipulate the economy. It lets the hardcore players get *further* ahead, casual players feel *further* behind, and downplays MC. 
---
You're massively downplaying the impact of Dire Maul. I'm not the biggest fan of ClassiCast, but their take on this is [pretty good.](https://youtu.be/eUTkeX0ubVM?t=878) I wish I could change your mind, but this is the Internet and that's impossible. 
---
Sunken temple was even more heavily cut down, it used to have four floors, the second and fourth floors needed to be cleared to  reach the  bosses and the first and third floors respectively. In current retail I believe only the third floor remains.
---
Thanks for your input, Mr. Programmer sir.
---
WoW has **always** had custom chats.
---
Anyone can type /join world
---
I've tried to search in the past for information on a user limit but couldn't find anything that suggests there is one.    
---
(If someone has conflicting information to this, I'd love to see a source.)
---
So even if Blizzard don't make you join a chance by default, there's nothing stopping it from existing.
---
DefCamp and Melderon. These two guys are absolutely brilliant and break things down in a way I haven't found on any other channel, great guides and even better analysis.
---
It was also a video on their channel that made me decide to be a shaman tank in my group with friends for classic, so I may be partial. :D
---
I can only recall one pserver "removed" world chat by forcing its rename to /global. 
---
You do understand the futility of your post and opinion in the era of Discord and Battle.net integration, don't you? Especially in the light of changes like sharding and loot trading. 
---
&gt;How much fun is it, for you, to be opportunistically killed by players on the other faction?
---
Very rarely would someone find this "fun". What it is, however, is a permanent sense of excitement knowing that you could get your day ruined at any moment. It makes it feel more alive and dangerous.
---
The best solution that I've come up with is to limit loot trading to raids (with a lockout, so not UBRS).
---
Guild's who's ML fucks up can still solve the issue without opening a ticket.
---
5mans are untouched.
---
PUGs are still at risk of ninjas, but that's always been the case.
---
[O rly](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dungeon_Finder)
---
&gt; In Patch 1.9, the LookingForGroup channel became global, although it was restricted to the major cities. **In Patch 1.11, the LookingForGroup channel became truly global, no longer restricted to chat in cities only**.
---
The channel was disabled in 2.0.1 in order to get players to use the LFG tool added in TBC instead.
---
&gt; With patch 1.11.2, Blizzard has made the decision to, [by default](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/el/wiki/Looking_For_Group), deactivate the LFG channel. Players can join it by typing /join LFG, according to the patch log.
---
Oh wow, I am Xarga the warrior! This brings back so many great memories. Somebody sent me a full video of this fight from a priests pov but I lost that file many years ago.
---
I fondly remember practising the movements of this fight in the twin emperors room.
---
I hope everyone is doing well still.
---
&gt;First of all, you can't transfer resources from alliance to horde, only via neutral AH which other people can steal (unlikely if u are fast)
---
Can you not sell a fishing pole for 400 gold and then buy it from the other faction?
---
Really, I am asking because I don't know. However, I can't see why you couldn't, and this would be almost the same as transferring resources.
---
Wrong template for classic :/
---
Oh it absolutely will.
---
There will be people who want to play without paying $15/mo.
---
There will be people who want to have more gold in classic, and would spend money to buy it.
---
You could trade someone a token on retail for nothing, and have them pay you on your classic character.
---
So, people who normally wouldn't be grinding gold for mounts, gear, etc. because they've already got it, will be grinding gold so they can get their sub for free. That leads to gold inflation, which leads to higher prices.
---
the problem with your entire argument is the fact that you are completely ignoring the crux of my rebuttal to you...
---
which was you harping on the 2.1.0 nerf to SoR when it was specifically aimed at nerfing Seal of Blood
---
SoR getting nerfed was a blackjack push at best - blizzard only added SoR to the nerf bat out of neccessity in case Ret Paladins tried stacking spell dmg gear instead of the itemization Blizzard intended them to use in TBC
---
the problem with SoBlood was huge from 2.0 to 2.1 since not only did it scale with melee stats, but it proc'd on every swing, proc'd on windfury procs, triggered melee procs itself but could also be twisted with Seal of Command
---
THAT'S WHY THE 2.1.0 NERF WENT THROUGH
---
Security, maintenance, etc.
---
Using the old client would have resulted in a decade worth of vulnerabilities and compatibility issues. Fixing all of that would be just as much work as porting the game to the modern client, and even if they fixed everything they'd then have two entirely different clients to maintain.
---
And that's not even touching the issue of using blade servers in 2019.
---
Porting to the modern client was the correct, and really only, solution. 
---
Dude, Xarga!  It's amazing that this reached you!  Would be great to gather (most) of the gang again just to chat, if nothing else.
---
What are your plans for Classic, if any?
---
&gt; you harping on the 2.1.0 nerf to SoR when it was specifically aimed at nerfing Seal of Blood
---
It nowhere says it's specifically nerfing SoR as a side-effect of nerfing Seal of Blood.
---
&gt; it proc'd on every swing, proc'd on windfury procs, triggered melee procs itself but could also be twisted with Seal of Command
---
This is also true of SoR.
---
But like you said, SoR is supposed to be the DPS seal, not the utility proc seal, like SotC. I totally agree with you on that.
---
Woah now. The Ulduar mage set is still one of the best tunic/pant cloth sets in the game. Goes great with the Lightbringer tabard too. 
---
I think I am a few days late to this post but I am so happy you posted it. Seeing this picture reminded me of how much fun I had back in classic WoW. 
---
Are you still playing these days??
---
Xarga
---
i was thinking the same thing. hunters seemed way to low and enh way to high. 
---
Simple and effective. I have heard some people used to roll need and contact a GM to get the loot to the friend. But in some cases they would give it to the next highest roller, or simply not do it for they have tried it to many times in the past 
---
gratz, it was I was looking for. This is the same nonsense to me as the ubrs 10men, scholo 5men anyway since it was in game for maybe a month and most players didn't know nor joined it. Anyway I hope they don't do this mistake and don't listen all pserv babies crying on the forum.
---
Not playing retail at this time.  Lost interest starting in WoD and totally lost all interest at the end of Legion.
---
Looking forward to Classic, however!  You?
---
If there’s no sharding at all I’ll gladly wait till 2025
---
I think felmyst didn't have world chat.
---
People wouldn't circumvate it with discord. Not everyone is running dual screen or willing to alt tab all the time while playing wow.
---
I’d imagine they are. Based on what we got at blizzcon, with the 16 debuffs, DM and Mara being in at launch, it seems to me like they’re only going to have a content release cycle for endgame content, primarily raids.
---
I’m okay with it. 
---
NOT A SINGLE PALADIN USED SOR IN TBC UNLESS YOU WERE SHOCKADIN SPEC
---
Blizzard wanted to head off any potential +Spell dmg only gear Rets from going on though hence why they nerfed SoR along with SoB at the same time since both were proccing on every swing, every windfury proc and triggering melee/trinket procs
---
I’m also leaning more towards a melee, the Warrior in this case. I want to tank while leveling up, and I’m also planning on roleplaying where she’s going to essentially have draconic heritage (think Dragon Knight themed) which would be great with Fury spec end-game.
---
It is actually quite crazy, I googled shattered hand purge for the first time in years to see if anything was left from those days and this reddit post appeared. 
---
It would be great to be able to chat with everyone again.
---
I think I will get classic. Doubt I will be able to put in the hours like I used to, but I do miss vanilla wow. 
---
how would you even know that , for example, I as a friend in the group with another friend and plan to roll on dalrends for him to double his chances of winning? You wouldnt know because I would have my own dalrends unequiped before joining the group. This is where youll be forever questioning people rolling need, especially guildies
---
Yeah, we're talking about Vanilla here, keep up.
---
SotC is a utility Seal (even it's judgement doesn't do direct damage!)
---
SoR is a DPS seal. But SoR ended up being better at SotC's job because of the way it was upgraded in 1.9.
---
Then they finally fixed this in 2.1 by surgically targeting exactly that utility.
---
I don't understand how you're so confused.
---
I got bored around the same time. WotLK was the last expansion that I played a lot of. 
---
Have you kept in touch with anyone else from Purge? Would be fun to play together again if people come back for classic.
---
You're on the wrong sub there bud
---
you're the one who brought 2.1.0 as the coup de grace of your argument bro...
---
one more time for clarity - the 2.1.0 nerf was aimed at SoB not SoR
---
When you use pfUI it automatically throw you into world hat. At least it did with me
---
Probably a dps pet, and FFS turn of aspect and growl hunter!!!!!!!
---
I mean I am all for orcs most of the time, I think a case can be made for tauren ele shaman though, being able to get a cast off with warstomp, in combination with how insane their burst potential already is post AQ. Usually what fucks you up on ele shaman is sombody sitting on you waiting to kick your lightning and heals and curse of tongues.
---
How do you figure hunters are better than rogues in wpvp? Being able to choose your fights with stealth makes rogue *the* wpvp class. 
---
Yes.
---
If you have to ask why , PvP servers are not for you.
---
Spot on!!
---
&gt; the 2.1.0 nerf was aimed at SoB not SoR
---
I see here:
---
&gt; Seal of Righteousness: This seal will no longer cause additional chances for weapon procs to trigger.
---
That's specifically talking about SoR. Sorry you may have missed that part of the patch notes.
---
Its a pretty solid list, but I think I would also kinda caveat it based on what raids are released post aq rogue below mage/lock, and early lock is lower while hunter is higher
---
what made it so?
---
MC was never cleared in vanilla prior to DM being released. Rag wasn't downed until about 6 or 7 weeks after DM came out.
---
Holy shit they gutted it. I never knew it was that bad!
---
GJ moving the goalposts and plugging your fingers in your ears. Have fun in Classic recruiting from trade chat!
---
You say that like it's a bad thing? Do you prefer linear dungeons with no sense of exploration?
---
so early game: +healing
---
late game/geared up: +mana
---
any benefit you can see to choosing a mixture of the two?
---
I thought everyone knew that?  Back when we trying to get her down, we just ultimately assumed it was random and directed the raid group where to run based on her position.
---
32 yo IT guy who works from home. Lots of MMO experience (including WoW Beta) but was still playing EQ during Classic, so I missed all that content.
---
Looking primarily for people who interested in Pantheon. Super flexible on server type and faction, class pref of Enh Shm or Warrior.
---
There was a reference to Silithus quests being gated during the Blizzcon panel. Anything related to the BWL, ZG, AQ, and Naxxramas would most likely be disabled until their release.
---
I used pets on pretty much every boss we fought.  Of course, the pet's life expectancy was about 20 seconds.
---
Stage 3 says Silithus content i assumed that meant the quest hub
---
As a mostly PvE player I always level and play on PvP severs, it’s almost a rite of passage for me and my friends. It keeps the leveling experience fresh and engaging, always having to look over your shoulder. 
---
Spiritual Healing boosts a lvl 60 in greens as much as it boosts a lvl 60 in t3, no?
---
Seems like the time when it would be most advantageous is right at level 60, then. And then as you get geared up, you switch to +mana, which will scale with your gear.
---
You know, I'm behind every single one of those Jaina gifs, but honestly...
---
The new Dwarf Model has an insane quality and is easily the best of the updated models by far.
---
But still, I'm against a toggle option. Why? Because this is a living world where the actions and decisions of the players around you matter. It's important that everyone in the game is on the same page, even in regards to looks.
---
Hmm, I don't remember using it.  Typically spamming trade chat was the way to find groups.
---
I just saw [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/al4s68/this_exchange_on_the_wow_facebook_page/efbat8v/) on r/wow and it made me think "huh, people still think there is a 'mechanic' behind DB?"

Arutha, Mazz via facebook.  Areia and I hang out IRL to this day.
---
Satsloader I found on youtube.
---
is the wand spec there just to help with farming? otherwise, i feel like unbreakable will (stun, fear, silence) would be better.
---
I think that the +healing talents do not scale with gear. They are based on the spell value alone. But +mana DOES scale with gear. So the actual optimal situation would likely be to start with +healing and then switch to +mana when you gear up more.
---
I would too. Only company that could be worse to work for would be Konami.
---
Man it’s been like the burning steps here. 38 Celsius right now.
---
Australia’s fauna is more like ungoro crater.
---
People are more aggressive.  Every encounter may result in them deciding to kill you, or just farm next to you.  Also, gank squads are pretty common in PvP servers.  On a server I'm playing I was busy doing PvE things in felwood and just needed one more wolf for a quest to hit 52.  And a gank squad of 3 people came by and killed me.  I rezed up and they killed me again.  I then escaped their camping and went looking for alliance to murder as revenge.  I spent the next hour world PvPing with people.  I had a lot of fun.  World PvP can be painful, but it ultimately ends up being one of the most enjoyable elements of the game as long as you're not awful at it.
---
There are about ten different ways you could have pointed that out without being an ass.
---
Neat. How is Gravestone Scepter have an ilvl of only 28 tho? It seems obviously better than some of the other green options that have a higher ilvl.
---
TBF now most people don't run low level dungeons more than once, if at all, because they are too long. Adding 30 extra identical trash mob packs to a dungeon isn't creative genius! 
---
If you resist a fear in a raid and your tank does not, you wipe the raid. It is a PvE spec.

Well in dungeons when well geared the mana pool for a given fight doesn't matter, so +healing would still be better in that case for less downtime in the dungeon. In raids it depends on fight length and the extent to which the priest downranks in addition to gear so can't really give generic advice.
---
A very strange way of approaching a multiplayer RPG.
---
It’s not about love, it’s all about money...
---
Very peculiar. I suppose some people more emphasize only the *game* portion of MMORPG, and some people put more value on the role playing portion.
---
Yep, they’re a public company. No love, soul, or passion. Everything is all about that Quarterly ROI. 🤤
---
When I was raiding I was always told it's how many dots you have on her. Fucking wiped to deep breath quite a few times. Hated that mechanic almost more then the whelps.
---
hmm yeah efficiency and play styles throws an interesting wrench.
---
it seems like in general though, +mana is the better choice for a geared player as the situations when you use up all your mana are going to feel worth it. i'm thinking long pvp battles, near-wipes in dungeons, and raids where mana control is an issue and you might be getting an innervate. if you spec +healing as a highly geared player you are likely on the cutting edge of min/max. and even then, idk if it would be worth it because those players are going to be so geared that it would be hard to give up the larger benefit of a scaled +mana talent.
---
It's now one of the most boring dungeons in the game. Basically just a square. Though, I appreciate that it still has high ceilings. Retail dungeons (and zones for that matter) feel so claustrophobic. 
---
So this is where the "don't stand next to other people" came from in "onyxia wipe/ 50 DKP minus!" . 
---
'eh there
---
Horde Guild leader here we have 34 awaiting members raiding tuesday and thursday from 7 pm your time till 10
---
This sounds almost exactly what I would have available. Got a website?
---
Did himanshu start WSB on alliance side
---
Night elf Mohawk 
---
we have a discord where every info is posted on there dont expect much action since its only real purpose right now is for me to figure out what classes we have and need and for ppl to be able to ask questions and chat
---
ill message you the link to the discord in DM
---
Is there a list like this for other weapon types? 
---
Cool, thanks.
---
It definitely wasn't known back then. People would claim she was "modified" to do it more often after every patch. If we knew it was random, that wouldnt have been a thing. 
---
I mean EVERY patch every hotfix every everything people made the claim that she had been buffed. And all along it was just rng.
---
The general idea that the churn of new players far out stripped those that were dissatisfied by a large margin. Looking at the OP and saying that that the direction of keeping the game at 60 and pushing out other content along the lines of what is listed may not be a sure fire way to keep people intrested any more than putting out BC.
---
Neither case is assured to make the game better but i would bet that Blizzard as a company is going to take the path of least resistance to this situation. With that in mind it is far easier for blizzard to do nothing or drop TBC in after  Classic has run a few years. Creating a new team to do new content, to me, means that Classic blew away all projections and is going in the same trajectory it was in 04. Now you have something where you can create something new because there was a well beyond expectations demand.
---
I hated it, but always carried these- https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13457/greater-fire-protection-potion
---
Every boss that isn't an AOE fest. A good example would be Shazzrah. Unless your guild is killing him in 30s, you're better off not using a pet since arcane explosions are going to eat your pet alive (as well as your melees, and your pet doesn't get priority on heals). 
---
Some fights like KT you are straight up not going to use a pet because there's the chance it will get Frost Blast and spread it to others, causing huge losses which equal a wipe in 99% of cases.
---
At the end of the day, it comes down to micromanaging your pet as well as it getting a minimum of heals. There's only a few fights where you straight up won't use your pet, since it can be between 5 to 15% of your overall damage on a given fight. Pet AI should be much smarter in Classic than it was in vanilla or Pservers, so that's also a thing to keep in mind.
---
Pretty sure you can't buy auctions listed from other characters on your account.
---
At worst you should have a wolf next to you with a howl macro though.
---
Yall NINNJAS postin in a troll thread. 
---
Well didn't the Nost group ask them if it was RNG based and Blizzard laughed and said no?
---
I remember this from the Nano interview on Countdown to Classic.
---
I wonder if people that say stuff like this are trolling or if they genuinely are this dumb.
---
Edited that in (probably while you were typing this or just before). Only exception would be on KT because of frost blast really.
---
The joke was ‘Onyxia deep breaths more often’ as a hidden patch note. Majority of people knew it was a joke. Even if it were the case, it would still be random, just triggers more often... randomly.
---
There was a progression guild back in TBC that actually said Lightwell was useful on M'uru. 
---
Exactly this, thank you for bringing some outside of the box thinking to the table.
---
Hey mate, during Nano's interview I believe he mentioned that they just asked if they would tell them 'how it worked' as opposed to whether or not it was RNG, and they got the laugh and a 'no' in response :P
---
Well this goes for gold trading either way. Whether it's between Retail and Classic, or Classic and Runescape, it has happened before and will happen again. 
---
The conversion rates will be ridiculous though like 1mil retail for 100g Classic lol.
---
Either way, it'll be a bannable offense.
---
Yeah I was completely surprised and saddened the first time I went to post-cata ST.  Completely gutted and removed all dungeon mechanics.
---
To anyone that doesn't know, when the original devs were at conventions or shows, "When it's ready" was always their answer for when the game was coming out. 
---
this is why classic might be a joke in the end. Looks like the real vanilla players are long gone, only new pserv kids remain trying to push features that were up for few weeks that no one used on retail.
---
You kids are in for big surprises at release seeing how many things are wrong on those servers. Forum tears will taste good.
---
You're making a suggestion that will dampen and divide the WoW community when we should be trying to bolster it.
---
I want WoW Classic to thrive and the beat way to do that is to let more people try it themselves. A shared sub will ensure that many more retail players will give it a shot.
---
Unlike retail, classic's quality of gameplay will speak for itself, no tricks or marketing required. You just gotta play, then the hooks are in and you can't possibly stop.
---
I think the decision to release classic wasn't so much restricted to having no development, but rather just no significant development. The two breakthroughs they had was finding a 1.12 backup and a couple r&amp;d guys figuring out how to run a modern client on it. 
---
About going forward, everyone realizes in their heart of hearts that classic will have an end date. There won't be a large population 5-10 years down the line if the options are playing post naxx or constantly rolling fresh forever. They deal with that grief by imagining an afterlife and how it could be. Whether any of those dreams happen depends entirely on how much money blizzard thinks they could make on it. 
---
Boomkin - 0 really, unless you want to 5 man and be the +5% spell crit support for your team, and even then, NS is better. 30/0/21 or 19/11/21 can be viable once geared.
---
Enh - Not the best overall, but viable even with pre-raid blues, just weak sustain / mana so keep that in mind.
---
Combat - needs to be very, very geared. Like BWL geared but pref Naxx
---
Arcane Mage - Only if you're POM pyro'ing things
---
Demonology - SL is the strongest 1v1 spec in the game
---
Ret - Sure, when geared, same issues as Enh shaman but even more reliant on gear
---
Fury Warrior - All warriors are gear dependent, but Fury for PvP is very, very dependent. Wouldn't do it till AQ gear
---
PvP is more fun if you prefer a challenge. Alliance Warlock have a quest they have to do in the Barrens (I think for their succubus) which is Horde country! You have to be really sneaky and hug mountain sides. It is kind of fun if you like playing a semi-stealth/survival game.
---
I remember also you learn to stay away from main roads because that is where the other faction tends to travel, but that means you are often running through groups of raptors, so pick your poison. :)
---
PvP can be annoying because you die a lot. Especially if they are a skull level and one shot you. There is nothing you can do and sometimes they corpse camp you so you literally have to turn off the game and log in in a few hours.
---
What is fun though is killing the other faction. It is the thrill of winning. Also I love that you can kill an opposing faction who is mining a node or opening a chest and then you can take that mining node or chest.
---
Sometimes it is better to not attack the other faction though. Bc imagine you are questing. You see an enemy player and you kill them. Now when you are doing your quest and attacking some mobs, they respawn and they kill you when 3 things are attacking you bc they want revenge. Then you kill them and they kill you and then you never get any questing done at all. Instead you just truce it up and then you can do your questing in peace. That is how I look at it anyway.
---
Lastly, it pays to be in a guild with 60s so if someone does kill you who is lvl 60, you can get your guild to come and kill them in revenge. That can be both annoying and entertaining at the same time. 
---
You sir, are a joke. Your baits are so low quality that even Alex Sensual wouldn't fall for them. Now stop posting and go back to daydreaming about """real vanilla players""". 
---
Alexsensual a 'real vanilla player"? I was there when he first started streaming on Nost. The poor dude didn't have a clue. He learned everything on private servers. He's played vanilla when he was 10 like most of you, probably not even made it to 60.
---
I can hear it in my head when I look at that spiral area on the left with all the minibosses. *RISE UP, ATAL'AI! RISE UP!*
---
Source on that? I heard about the exec that left. Who has left that is part of the team working on Classic?
---
One of my funnest times in vanilla was pvp at those spellbinders that drop crusader. It's great if nobody is there so you can farm rune cloth,  and crusader. But if an enemy comes it's a blast and a far walk away from the GY lol. People dont easily give up there. And you often see the same ppl come back. You make friends with the same faction that comes there as well. It adds a totally different experience in the world you would otherwise miss.
---
Execs have left and I believe a lot of the worker bees. The "when its ready" philosophy may not be applicable anymore.
---
We have a weekly thread for this type of thing. Stay tuned!
---
Ele? I'd imagine it ooms quite often 
---
Removed for rule 7 violation. This has already been posted today.
---
I'm an engineer IRL and yeah.
---
Don't need the same team. This team's job is not to innovate but to rebuild, so all you need (for now) are skilled engineers and time
---
Ah, so when you said "everyone is jumping ship" you were just speculating. I was worried that I had missed something big.
---
Bubble had bad stigma because it couldn’t be used on the main tank or any warriors. If they had bubble they wouldn’t get any Rage when being hit.
---
It was great on other players though.
---
Usually for progression raiding you would have 1 maybe 2 priests go disc so they could power infuse for more dps....as you got better gear then you could go more disc for more added raid dps, but you lose healing numbers so it was just a transition.
---
Either start holy then convert, or let people know you will be using power infusion and hope you have enough healing. Just don’t shield a tank.
---
Yeah look into it yourself. Judging by some youtube channels its getting bad though.
---
Agree, Tauren Priests are kings in Vanilla ;)
---
I like your optimism.

---
Alliance don't really have this problem because of Fear Ward, but raids often have fears. If you resist one and your tank doesn't (messes up his stance dance), the raid boss hits you, and you die. For a pure PvE spec this is not worth the risk. You need five points, Wand Spec is the only other option. 
---
If you play on a PvP server or PvP in your PvE spec on the regular for whatever reason, you can swap them. I don't really do PvP optimization of any kind.
---
YouTubers literally make money by stirring drama. They aren't news, and it's not that bad. You should really do yourself a favor and taking them at face value. They aren't reporters, just kids speculating about stuff they know nothing about. I mean, Blizzard just hired a top designer away from CDPR ffs. They are fine with their talent.
---
Be sure you allocate ~2 or so hours to run a dungeon in Vanilla. Only exceptions may be RFC and Stockades. Prepare to spend more than 15 mins in it and make sure you've got all the possible quests available, as the quests are what redeem the poor xp/hr in Vanilla dungeons. You're gonna have fun. 
---
Nah. I’ve spent thousands of hours on private servers, and in the real og. It’s the best game of all time. 
---
Saying *"Deep Breath is totally random"* is a good way to make Ony deep breath you. Just saying.  
---
Yeah it might have been better, sure. But they explained it’s just not feasible with their current infrastructure. Check out the classic panel from the last blizzcon:   https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM
---
Like a lot of people have mentioned, you don’t have to level as prot especially if you have a competent friend as a healer. Just go full arms warrior and save a shield, ofcourse any tank gear that drops just take it during dungeons but for questing arms+ 2 hand until the big dungeons at level 50+
---
During early dungeons you can tank with your 2hand if your healer is good, but if it becomes a bit dicey just swap to shield, no need to be protection specced
---
&gt; It definitely wasn't known back then. 
---
If it wasn't known back then, why did I and the rest of my guild's raiding team know it?  Simple observation was enough to show that it was random after a few attempts.  More so how often they happened didn't really matter.  What mattered was training people where to run.
---
&gt;People would claim she was "modified" to do it more often after every patch.
---
Yes, idiots in guilds who couldn't reliably dodge her deep breaths.  They liked to make up all sorts of theories about it to cover up for the fact that they sucked at dodging DBs. 
---
Protip, the confusing maze section is easy if you just follow the mushrooms. 
---
As a hunter... fuck shadow priests.  The worst matchup for me was some super high DPS shadow priest who just wouldn't die.
---
Arms is good enough to tank leveling dungeons. You can go into Prot for Imp Bloodrage and Last Stand for 'just in case' moments (and shield spec is dope).
---
With some simple stance dancing and manageable pulls - it's fine. I wouldn't worry too much about points into Prot until after lv40
---
That's actually pretty genius, as long as the chat displays this change in loot settings it sounds perfect. You cant complain from either side if you make it toggle
---
I think eventually expanding the level cap and building on the unfinished vanilla content on azeroth might be pretty cool. Avoiding the mistakes of the past with the expansions.
---
Diablo drama, hots dying, retail wow sucking, hearthstone. I even hate overwatch. It doesn't seem like the same company that I've been following since rocknroll racing on sega.
---
im actually a concept artist to, and i got some free time to. do you think this place would be interested to see re-designed concepts of outlands terrain in a vannilla design standpoint
---
Play whatever you want but If you wanna min-max you should go forsaken as Spriest. Plague is OP af. 
---
Another reason I'll roll ally as a hunter. As a dwarf you can cancel out devouring plague. And you can viper kite them down if you have space to work. But dwarf priests just stoneform your sting. By the time you wait for that and drain them, their shadow word pain will kill you lol
---
Say stuff like what? The obvious joke about it being ready in 2006?
---
Thanks for the reply! 
---
My belief is that Devouring Plague is just too expensive mana wise and is easily countered by Dwarves and Paladins. 
---
Shadowguard is really good because it stuns ANYONE giving you damage, and scales really well with spell power. Not to mention the 2 minute 20% healing debuff
---
I have mixed feelings on the beta.
---
I'm like 65% sure we *will* have a beta. But not confident. 
---
If they did a beta -- I think they would start the beta without raids/pvp. Then test their "release cycles", PVP, etc. Their purpose would be to test the infra &amp; cycles.
---
But I'm not sure they would even want to test that. Classic is in a weird place. They don't need things *"tested"*, really. They need content *"verified"*. They need to make sure things *"feel"* right. The public wouldn't necessarily help here - as only bliz have a verbatim 1.12 client running. 
---
I think there will be a (closed) beta. It makes sense. It helps gauge interest. It tests the systems. It lets bliz get the launch 'just right'. I'm just not that confident... 
---
Because it's a social game.. Everyone should be seeing the same thing so they can have a shared experience.
---
So why does it matter to you if I can change my models? Where does it affect you?
---
Just like real life there is no way of knowing how others see you. So why does it affect you if others can toggle different models? Surely people in real life see you differently than you see yourself. Do you insist they view you the same way?
---
No i love classic, I just disagree with the narrative.
---
Many times did I witness (and maybe partook in... once or twice) the doors being blown open anyway and a rather upset Rogue run for his life.  Hey, using the cannon was so much more fun!
---
Can we not share in the experience if you have classic models and I don’t?
---
5 points in cruelty in fury(+crit), all the rest in arms until you can respec to get sweeping strikes.  At which point grab a bunch of mobs, use sweeping strikes and cleave until everything is dead while your friend dots + heals. Once you get WW, it's even easier.  
---
Specing to far into prot actually reduces your ability to tank because rage = damage done and received.  If you nerf the damage you're doing and reciving then you won't have enough rage to generate aggro.  I'd recommend not doing prot spec at all until you're getting ready to tank raids. 
---
To tank successfully, learn your aggro and defensive abilities, and wear lots of +sta gear with high armor values or at least don't wear a lot of low STA dps items when tanking.  Use pots to help your healer out(A well placed big healing pot can give them time to catch up) and learn to tab target sunder and spam Battle Shout in defensive stance for AOE aggro. Build and maintain a tanking set.  Even at 24 my warrior has items that are for regular DPS and items that are part of my tanking set that have more HP for smoother dungeon runs.  Items that are half DPS/half STA are ideal when tanking.
---
I ran disc as a pvp player. Just infuse the druid next to you as you spammed bubbles and let the druid hot the f out everyone... Pretty much cleared out blacksmith in 2 minutes. And then pushed up to farm then camped graveyard for a clean win
---
My original idea when I played the game was that it would be more first person warcraft 3. As in, fighting enemy factions would be THE focus if the game. I still feel like it is more fun playing this way. It isn't  "oh shot, that guy might gank me," but more "oh shit, that's the fucking enemy"
---
I never realized until recently how roleplayerish my pvp mentality was, but I loved it. And even if you aren't starting shit, the extra danger of the world makes things pretty intense.
---
&gt; But dwarf priests just stoneform your sting.
---
Spam rank 1 stings.  The cost of removing them is about 5-10x higher than the mana cost of the sting and most people never check if the sting is the highest rank or not.  I use this frequently to paladins who literally dispell away all their mana.
---
&gt;People are more aggressive
---
This 100%. Like, dude, you rolled a rogue on a pvp server, dont act like you don't deserve a gank
---
&gt;Fury Warrior
---
Had a friend who PvPed at a Fury Warrior.  He wasn't as much as killing machine as I was with arms, but he made up for it will engineering tricks and great CC.  
---
&gt;Combat rogue
---
Try a mace combat rogue.  I don't remember if they nerfed it towards the end of vanilla, but I used to butcher people.  I'd defend nodes in AV and kill 3 or 4 people at a time keeping them off the flag using lots of CCs and random mace stun procs.
---
Nar that's from the fireball conflag effect.
---
That’s a full afternoon/evening
---
in the eastern plaguelands there is a quest and an NPC up north talking about taking the ghostlands back from the scourge.
---
That is the way to do it, yes.
---
But the god darn goblins will take their cut, be sure of that (15%?).
---
I still got lost even with the dungeon help map.
---
[Dude...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bobp5OHVsWY)
---
Seriously fuck that place.
---
I cannot wait to go back!
---
It's a stupid idea. Whoever won it should only be able to trade it to the next highest roller. This voting shit is dumb as fuck
---
This is very true. If they didn't bother adapting it to their modern engine and remastering it, effectively making a source port, it would've released months ago.
---
...and if you're fighting a troll, it's the damage and stuns from shadowguard that's going to kill you. though yeah, still a way easier match than dwarves.
---
What a shitty post.
---
You should only be able to trade to the next highest roller. And so on. 
---
No voting. I like the idea to toggle as well.
---
Learn when to save face and call it quits dude, sheesh
---
Can someone explain what the difference is? I don’t really get what they’re doing 
---
Air Totem Questline
---
There's very little reason for a beta.
---
We might get a stress test / hype builder like a week or 2 before launch.
---
How much does the extra 5-10 resistance impact chance to resist at level 60? Genuinely curious. 
---
Bro you need to gain some confidence
---
This. It is literally in their mission statement. 
---
Didn't it actually have something to do with invisible rabbits?
---
Even on the servers that have the hubs a lot of the actual quests related to rep and the gates are unavailable 
---
I really hope so, it’s a much more streamlined and fun levelling experience when they are available.
---
Otherwise it’s multiple levels of grinding every 5-10 levels 
---
Just from I remember the few high pop servers were basically 7/10 pvp with a pvp and rp server in there
---
I am kinda annoyed at this too, I bought vanilla tbc, WotLK and Cata. Now I have to buy your new expansion that I have no interest in playing and pay a monthly charge for games I already own? I'm fine with the sub charge, but WTF do I have to buy your new expansions for to play a game I already own?
---
priests can also cure diseases, though not accidentally like paladins can.
---
but yeah, you're assessment is spot on, shadowguard is fucking amazing and even hex of weakness can only be cured by two classes, mages (who won't bother/realize) and druids (who also generally don't bother, despite getting utterly fucked by it).
---
Power Infusion - Pretty useless early on because nobody is geared so the % damage increase, while nice for the receiving player, does not equal the benefits of extra healing perks from holy.
---
Stronger bubble - very mana inefficient, you're not going to be spamming this in progression content. Usually only bubbling people who are about to die because it is instant cast. Not bubbling tanks because they won't get rage (unles they're like 10% hp and going to die)
---
Lower Mana instant casts - Renew and bubble are both mana inefficient and have their place, but again you won't be spamming it and you'll be casting heal spells utilizing the 5 sec rule most of the time. Nova has niche use and requires your party to be stacked up which you probably won't be in most cases.
---
Threat Reduction - I mean if you're pulling aggro as the healer there is an issue.
---
It's fine for 5 mans, a serious guild that is min-maxxing will want holy for progression and later will accept Disc for the power infusion.
---
A casual guild will probably still allow you to play as disc as long as the other priests are still holy.
---
[deleted]
---
I remember him mentioning that on Nost they used a /roll system for sure. Then again I've heard him speak on multiple platforms, could be mixing it up.
---
ur doggone right
---
Warlocks fuck up hunters as well dont they?
---
Not doing a beta would also guarantee to at least get one subscription out of everyone who doesn't play anymore. While having a beta people would already have an idea if it is something they want to play or not
---
Orc have of the best pvp racials for casters being the 25 stun resistance. Lock also has the benefit that SM Ruin is equal viable for premade BGs aswell as PvE. Another benefit is gearing. Most early tier items in raids are not searched after for PvE but do work well for PvP as they are high stam and have some ressistance. Aka gearing will be fairly allright
---
I think you’re right on that one :)
---
Do you think they would do even a closed beta, maybe to get some exposure from Classic content creators/aficionados? Keep people hyped?
---
It's hard to imagine they wouldn't do some sort of beta.
---
Power Infusion spec is a bigger decrease to the priest's healing output in a fight than it is an increase for a caster's DPS, but it isn't a big difference. Once a guild has the hardest raid available on farm they will have more healing than they need. This is when power infusion spec shines, as priests can sacrifice some of their healing power to increase raid DPS.
---
Power Word Shield is an emergency tool because it gets a very low +0.1 absorb from each point of healing and is very mana inefficient compared to downranked heals.
---
"a mount".
---
A as in one.
---
Not sure why you find that hard to figure out. Warlocks, and Paladins get a class quest at level 40, to get their free mount.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?quest=1661
---
http://classicdb.ch/?quest=4490
---
Flying mounts = unemployment flight master (would you accept that !!) 
---
Sg could be in but having sillithus hub is no right. Many quests relate to aq and doing field duty pre mc is just silly
---
I would go atleast 26 points in disc as a fresh 60 as the mana pool helps out nicely in 5 mans as opposed to the +healing build.
---
It would have been more vanilla like by a miles. Now we'll have a kind of Frankenstein classic+. That is cheaper to maintain etc
---
Honestly, I feel like Dwarf and Orcs were the only races they did a decent job with in the update. I do prefer the old models, but those two do just look outstanding imo.
---
Also all the other massive benefits of being an engineer. 
---
ALL of out Priests are REQUIRED to spec for Power Infusion.
---
Even the Shadow Weaving bitch (me) has to have PI.
---
Very early on when you're first clearing MC you might need the extra healing from going Holy. But it wont be long before it's not needed and the DPS boost from PI will be overall better for your guild/raid.
---
So much this
---
I confess, goggles have always been my motivation for engineering. 
---
And wizard oil?
---
I'm absolutely for a world chat, especially now that it will have some oversight. It does a lot to tie the community together  and to allow people to get help once the initial leveling rush is over.
---
boomkin? Horrible until geared
---
enh shammy? great, you have a chance to 1 shot people, except you are much better off other specs...small man fighting enh is great, otherwise horrible.
---
combat rogue? absolutely fine
---
arcane mage? If you can do a pom spec, great..otherwise keep away unless you multibox
---
demonology warlock? not sure, only managed to get mine to 52 before TBC. Seemed like an ok spec.
---
ret paladin? Much much more viable in any other spec.
---
fury war? awesome.
---
It will increase the amount of tourists, give them more incentive to use sharding and to use it for longer
---
Well, Runescape Classic servera finally closed down last year after seventeen years of service.  Even then, players were still around and enjoying the game, frantically finishing their quests, and achieving their final goals before for server went down forever.
---
The fact is, there will be a small group of players that will choose to never stop playing for decades.  Thirty years from now, there will be players on WoW Classic servers even if just to use it for roleplaying or as an AOL messenger.  These types of players will funnel into a single or small group of, now and forever, populated server(s).  There will always be someone to play with, probably my kids if you wait long enough.
---
My point here is, the community will never die as long as servers are still being hosted.
---
Just give me arena 
---
There's a big difference between all the tourists and seasonal players leaving and the game dying off. 
---
Is this what we've come to? Reposting ignorant Facebook comments from r/wow?
---
Doesn't matter how many threads you guys make.
---
ACTIVISION HAS NO BUSINESS CHANGING A CLASSIC BLIZZARD GAME.

Just getting in ST is a long slog through a maze of elites.

That and the womanz ...

I fully agree with the above. I’ve been testing it recently. I struggled to even hold agro as prot at the start and it was much slower to kill mobs. 
---
You’re better off getting a 2H and if you don’t have heals learn to kite it with hamstring if you get agro.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised of a PTR for two weeks. I’m being hopeful but they do need to make sure it’s a smooth launch they have a lot riding on it.
---
only horde, alliance only gets it at 20.
---
I've been the same Human Paladin since OG launch through current retail.
---
I'll be that same Human Paladin again.
---
Quit the game.
---
I hate Activision. Fuck them. I'm not some junky who can't live without wow. 
---
Stop calling them blizzard. 
---
Stopped reading at "post-naxx".
---
Playing around on the pservers for years has helped me to know what I want to play next time around (Classic).
---
I'm going back to my roots and playing what I mained for the majority of my WoW days.
---
I've tried many other classes, some have been fun. But now it's time to come home.
---
Orc rogue.
---
Going rogue this time because it is one of the only classes I haven’t experienced at max level in vanilla. (Rogue, pally and Druid) 
---
I have never been one to instigate pvp... but this time it’s going to be different!
---
I chose orc for the racials. I like the passive stun resist for pvp, 25% less paladin stuns! 
---
And the blood rage racial will be good in both the pvp and PvE aspects of the game. 
---
That’s it in a nutshell, I’ve flip flopped from paladin, to Druid, to rogue so many times.... but I think I’ve finally convinced myself this time. 
---
NE hunter. I'm always NE hunter, since day 1 in wow. I don't know why, but I love hunters and I love Teldrassil (so that MIGHT be it). 
---
I've tried other classes, but they just feel clunky, less smooth. A hunter just cuts through mobs like hot butter, that's the feeling I keep coming back for.
---
A male, troll warrior. It was a process of elimination.
---
Class: 
---
* I like horde more 
---
* I've played mage and rogue to death
---
* I don't want to heal 
---
* I don't like pets
---
* I love topping DPS meters
---
* I love tanking dungeons
---
Race:
---
* The female undead model is my favourite  but because my focus will almost entirely be raiding, I wanted more useful racials. And my main was a female undead. 
---
* I don't like the orc models. They look more cute than menacing.
---
* Tauren are too big. I don't want to clip mobs and other players.
---
* Male trolls look cool and I like their appearance options. I've already mapped out what my troll will look like. Blue skin, red hair.  
---
 It's all 'bout the dun dun do do do dumb 
---
I'd flip my shit if I got a message like that
---
cant say much about warlocks, but props for not falling for the ud noobtrap.
---
devouring plague scales so shitty coz of the healing part, it blocks ur inner focus for other uses and only has 1 10% chance to blackout. shadowguard meanwhile gives you 3 10% chances to blackout, is super cheap for the damage you get and will outscale dp with the right gear.
---
hex of weakness is easily the most underrated spell in bg's and in general touch of weakness doesn't even come close to hex's utility.
---
sure wotf is a nice tool, but thats all undead has going for them.
---
No. It completely ruins the fantasy and immersion. The character you have created should be the exact character people around you see.
---
retail will die off once ppl see how cancerous and garbage it is compared to vanilla 
---
lul
---
I think for most, its what people played in Vanilla, so they want to re live their glory days. For me, I started late 2006 so by the time i hit 60, everyone had moved on to BC so i never got to do end game Vanilla as i was doing catch up. I will play a Holy Paladin to be able to play the Vanilla end game, and to get the sexy T2 set. 
---
god i hate this sub, zzhe only sensible response is at the bottom of the thread.
---
PVP server is obvious IF you enjoy pvp:ing. As someone who doesn't enjoy world pvp it just gets in the way of questing, travelling to dungeons in enemy zones or farming materials for your professions. 
---
Say you have an hour to farm some leather or do a few quests. On a pvp server that hour could be wasted due to constant ganking, you get frustrated and log off. Zero enjoyment. 
---
Of course, if you enjoy pvp, you've had a lot of fun in that hour.
---
So you just need to ask yourself, "do I enjoy pvp so much that it's worth interupting the other aspects of the game?"
---
I honestly have no regrets, I just didn't know better back then and was a massive dirty clicker. 
---
It actually took a long time to unlearn these bad habits, I thankfully never keyboard turned but this shit is terrible i just never knew better. 
---
This was vanilla with the pre tbc patch, so warlocks basically at their most op, but i played a lot of av all during vanilla just because i loved even the turtles in there and still do 
---
I wanna grab you by the shoulders and scream at you "use your damn keyboard ffs!" 
---
Relax.  Most of the trash in the private server community is destitute.  You won't have to deal with most of them on any basis.  There's also, uh, regional server options.  I'll just leave it at that.
---
Facebook??  Isn't that the thing russians use to frighten our uncles into making rash political decisions?
---
Fights where people are jammed together are great for it. Chromaggus and BLLL come to mind (everyone hiding around the corner for LOS), Golemagg and Onyxia due to the small theatres of combat, even the Three Bugs and Battleguard Sartura where everyone is taking a crapload of damage.
---
I don’t think I’ve ever innervated a warlock before. Giving them a crit max level regrowth is basically the exact same thing.
---
PvP is pretty cool. It's a great way to experience the dread of mutual destruction. You COULD kill that hunter that is farming in your spot, but he might get friends and fuck you up. So then you gotta bring friends and before you know it it's a slaughterhouse up at your farming spot and no one is farming shit.
---
You know that. He knows that. You may decide to coexist peacefully or you may decide it's time this horde scum/alliance s.o.b. is going damn, no matter the cost! Your call.
---
And that is what WoW is all about in my opinion. 
---
You really don't think the developers have any passion for the games they produce at blizzard? Blizzard doesn't even offer competitive salaries
---
I'm not stating you're incorrect, I'm just willing to bet against this notion. The main reason why I'm so interested in doing this is due to my own collective habits. The reason why I'm willing to bet against Blizzard is due to them starting the game on patch 1.12 . This patch has me both curious and worried due to the fact that classic WoW Epic mounts became no longer available in 1.4; even if the do stick with vanilla there's a chance of items going away. 
---
Another bit of pure speculation I have is that Vanilla might very well patch while current/modern WoW has lulls in content; it would be the smart thing to do to keep people subbed while also introducing additional content. This is 100% pure speculation and an absolute gamble. If I'm wrong, I'm going to have a lot of cool items I could have only witnessed in Classic WoW at the very least.
---
I agree. what I would personally like to see are "Classic" and "Progressional" servers. There will be some servers that are static in being a specific expansion/patch while other servers that just slowly release content in real time.
---
You’re dead on. The AQ raids (20/40) gave me some of the best pieces of gear I ever received during my entire play time in Vanilla. Boots of the Vanguard and Mace of Unending Life from AQ20 are crazy, and I had Guise of the Devourer and Gloves of Enforcement which were also massive.
---
Can’t wait to get that gear again.
---
Fury Warriors can fight me for it. Just give me like a 10 second head start. 
---
There hasn’t been a good Blizzard game in 10 years. Most of their games as of late have been extremely shitty copies of other games. A company incapable of coming up with fresh, innovative ideas is probably lacking a bit of passion. Plus, the people who would ever live in Cali and take that shit salary are probably not the brightest. 
---
Im not sure what you are trying to argue. It literally wasnt not known to be factually random back then. Its not really arguable when so many threads claiming it was modified are googlable. And especially not when literal WoW developers have said when they were hired the first thing they did was go into the code and read how the deep breath was coded....
---
It was not widely known. Maybe you and your special circle were the only ones that knew, congratulations! But even people within Blizzard literally have stated they didn't know back then, so its not like Im making something up. Its the most discussed and theorycrafted mechanic in WoW history.
---
NE Resto Druid. I've got 2 friends who both are rolling Rogue and i didn't want to miss all the epic Rogue stuff they were going to do.. 
---
I also wanted to play a Healer so Druid is the only choice for me. 
---
I'll probs make another Paladin alt though.
---
Male Dwarf Priest disc/holy (leveling shadow). This is what I play on pserver and I absolutely love it. So easy to get a raid spot and I love raid healing, super high skill ceiling. Itemization is cool too.
---
First alt will be female human rogue. I’ve never played a rogue.
---
Second alt will be human or warrior... recreation of my very first 60 in 2005.
---
Third alt... gnome mage. Just love the class, and good for farming.
---
It's rare to run with talents in one tree. Power infusion is a hand talent but putting disc talents doesn't prevent you from using holy spec spells and some talents there too.
---
Definitely wasn't considered a joke to everyone. Lots of people really believed there was a method to it. Look at the AMA in the OP. That's literally why people asked about it constantly.
---
Fair point, but I was looking at both wPvP situation. Attacking and defending.
---
Rogues are REALLY  good if they have the opener. But if you are already fighting and didn't see your opponent coming it can turn pretty quickly, especially against anything that can put a dot on you.
---
 A hunter has detect human which makes it harder to "sneak" up on him unnoticed and he has a better chance fighting, since his pet is likely to have agro so the hunter chills at 100% life.
---
That and the more or less infinite kiting space in the open world made me pick hunter over rogue. 
---
i legit remember trying to google bindings back then but there was not a lot of resources , i dont feel too bad just because i didnt know better. 
---
what sucked is it took me ages to unlearn this bad habit , to this day i prefer to use a mouse with a lot of buttons and bind everything to that. But binding to a mouse is worlds better obviously. 
---
As a healer lvl 18-20 is fine, although your agro radius might be a little large.
---
if classic has loot trading, ill join a russian guild.
---
Wand dpsales no sense is what's up, look and lesser and greater magic wand, they do allot more damage then they should on their lvl
---
They did not like him, for he told the truth.
---
Jokes aside its the middle of the night right now for most people so there isn't too much traffic on the sub atm
---
Early 2004. 
---
Wut
---
Running the game on a modern game engine and restoring all the since removed assets and B.net integration are the major differences.
---
Even as a mostly pve player I find PvP realms more fun, it just makes the world feel more alive and dangerous. It can be frustrating at times, but it's worth it.
---
&gt; Im not sure what you are trying to argue. It literally wasnt not known to be factually random back then. 
---
Is there any mob in the game that reacts the sort of stupid theories people were putting up? Grouping up? Moar dots?  No there isn't.  Blizzard is the king of reusing stuff if Ony had some sort of super special logic on DBs it would have popped elsewhere in the game.
---
The logic to determine it was random is quite easy: None of the theories people proposed had any basis in any sort of gameplay we'd seen anywhere else in wow. What type of attacks do we see in wow? Ranged vs Meele attacks, random attacks, random targeted attack and on a timer attacks.  Since Ony Deep breath didn't follow the timer attack algorithm or any sort positional targeting targeting a single person, it was obviously a random attack.
---
&gt;It was not widely known. 
---
You know this how?  Among the raiders I hung out with everyone knew it was random.  It wasn't even a topic of discussion once the original wacky theories were disproved.   You're confusing the volume of crap that morons who posted on the net about it with the people who regularly cleared the content who knew exactly how it worked who didn't bother posting it over and over again.
---
what about BGs? Mages are definitly more useful there, while you can easily get by without a rogue. 
---
And even if I take "higher skill cap" at face value, how does that change anything? Wouldn't a class that is just as effective with less skill needed be better?
---
I love the nonchalant way of destroying people. You never seemed like you were every in a hurry.   
---
Like watching Cecil Turtle from the Bugs Bunny cartoons
---
&gt; A intimidating, barren landscape, where low-levels see ?? level mobs &amp; capped characters occasionally grinding. 
---
again, what did you grind there?
---
The release of expansions is not even planned in a business project yet - they could as well fire up their HR.
---
&gt; They have an entire catalog that sucked the numbers up higher in TBC and Wrath?
---
to retain the spirit of Classic.
---
Level cap increase and GearScore are the first step towards BfA's gear invalidating process.
---
what was up with it?
---
Every single fucking water temple
---
I would have no qualms about a delay until winter if that means they get it right from the start. 
---
And in other players cases, alt f4ing
---
Sounds a lot like LFR
---
Pretty sure I had read something about this somewhere before
---
You think
---
I love Vanilla as much as the next guy but this is just not true.  Both Hearthstone and Overwatch are great games, they may be copies, but they are very fun to play.
---
It's happening deal with it.
---
everyone would exploit it, making it effectively "after", anyway
---
&gt; But if you roll need on it by mistake, and win it accidently, you cant trade it? Is this how it works? I think it defeats the purpose of blizzards entire system.
---
We're all just guessing, but when you *could* trade Needed items all the problems everyone here is predicting happened. Whereas when you could only trade Greeded items there was no problem.
---
So it seems pretty unlikely to me Blizzard will re-implement a system known to fail.
---
&gt; Buddy. I'm not time stamping shit. Do your research and stfu.
---
Busted. You can't do it. You came in blustering and bluffing and you had nothing.
---
Jog on sunshine.
---
Night elf Druid, white hair, blueish-purplish skin.
---
Not decided about face yet, but definitely not the blindfolded one.
---
Already decided on hairstyle and beard style, though.
---
Rule of thumb: base mana is a pretty insignificant portion of the total mana available to you in a fight, especially in raids. Most of the mana comes from mp5 (greatly enhances by having a shaman/paladin), pots, spirit regen and the occasional innervate/mana tide. 
---
Therefore, increasing your base mana by talents or int is relatively inefficient and does not scale with the buffs you get in a raid-environment. Enhancing your healing done is the way to go. 
---
not to mention vanilla is based off other mmos and as such is also a "copy"
---
Boomkin  :  Can be strong if you don't go to far into the tree. You still want feral charge and nature swiftness.
---
Enh shammy : Really strong early on (especially if you manage to get sulfuras). Ele is stronger later on.
---
Arcane mage : Pom Pyro
---
Demonology warlock : SL is the strongest 1V1 spec in the game, you have tons of survivability and no one can kill you but you might find you lack burst in battleground.
---
Ret Paladin : Can be Strong but people will want you to go holy because it's just far stronger (i mean, 2 day ago i was doing some pug ab that 90% of the time ended in 2cap, then the best geared pvp holy pal (really skilled to) came for fun alone for 2 games and we won by 5cap).
---
Fury Warrior : Decent (look at swifty) but mortal strike really make arms just stronger.
---
&gt; You know this how?
---
Because I know how to use Google? Hers Engadgets staff getting it wrong.

And heres a link to the actual AMA where Blizzard developer ION describes how once he was hired, the first thing he did was go and check the code to see how deep breath worked, because even as one of the most hardcore raiders in the world back then from the theorycraft haven of Elitist Jerks **HE wasnt even certain of how it worked**.
---
Theres me supporting my position. Now would you like to provide actual supporting evidence that it being 100% random **WAS widely known?**
---
This is certainly not true as many players were soloing Ony later and there were no crazy amounts of DB. 
---
software engineering doesn't count, I hope you know that
---
I've already chosen my hair color and style and skin color for both my main and alt.
---
But name, only for main - I have a few ideas for the alt, though.
---
You have to be the most cancerous and overtly repulsive person I've met here. I really hope you're not playing Horde.
---
&gt;And no, I will not invite your retri paladin to my instance group.
---
You'll be playing horde, got it.
---
wrong.
---
Figured id give some advice on taming old broken tooth. I have tamed him on private servers and had a hell of a time doing so. Hoping this information can be useful to whomever takes up the task of trying to make him yours.
---
As usual let me know what you all though, hope to hear some feedback from everyone
---
Broken link, friend.
---
You can shield a tank, just never within the first 1-2 minutes of a fight.
---
It's great for predictable damage (patchwerk). But it's a pain in the ass when you use it the first 30 seconds of an encounter. 
---
Well, it’s not. But that doesn’t mean that a revamp of classic is going to suck inherently. 
---
Will it be your first time with WOW, or just first time with vanilla?
---
It would be epic to have more new players
---
*summons a Doomguard*
---
The targeting of it is based on invisible rabbits afaik. The timing is another story
---
Even the thought of him inviting any paladin signals that this guy plays Alliance. For once I'm sorry for you.
---
Can you imagine a world where every original idea was only iterated on once?
---
oh damn, that mithril casing quest, and the one guy flying to Tanaris to buy it for the rest
---
I will be playing horde actually. I made the retri comment just to get my point across.
---
In duel situations yes. Open world pvp you stand a chance as hunter vs anything 
---
I know for sure I will be playing as a ale Orc Warlock with black hair, a topknot, a trimmed beard with and with dark green skin. I just know for sure that I prefer the male orc casting animations and that Warlocks are handy to have when attacking Alliance cities.
---
yeah, not at all. ud spriest is nice and easily better than human or nightelf and maybe even dwarf, but they cant really contest trolls.
---
I tested out every class on a private server.
---
I like healing, I like the levelling of the priest.
---
Theres an NE Male face that is very "normal" looking, young appearance and he seems to have a 1000 yard stare. Pick that one. You look like a tranquil forest God in tier gear
---
That sucks. I really want to be as far away from you as possible. You're not playing on a PvP server are you?
---
No sharding? One server with a few million players racing to tag the same mobs in the starting areas?
---
Yeah one of the theories back then was that standing in too big of a bunch caused her to deep breath. There were a million different suspicions of what controlled it back then.
---
... or just let people enjoy the different aspects of the game as they please instead of gatekeeping what the right way is? 
---
Well i do prefer to complete the dungeon rather than having to leave the dungeon whenever you failed the jump because no one could find their way back to the group, which is what happened back when the dungeon was a maze. 
---
Lol no, Mr Armchair Developer. 
---
They've literally said the opposite, that it would take them way longer to get there if they worked from the bottom up.
---
troll is easily the best race for spriests.
---
You are very bad at reading people, obviously I will be playing on a PvP server. But don't worry, I don't think our paths will cross because I'll be level 60 when you are still experimenting with different hairstyles.
---
Me too. But not all of vanilla, but until I tried to duel a gnome warrior as a destruction warlock, I remember it was in Wetlands. With that jumping around, it was a definite sign to learn to use hotkeys.
---
At the very beginning, I remember having hotkeys everywhere. Like, numpad, home end, etc. And was playing the Gothic way, without a mouse. Then, some point in endgame, I only started to using mouse look.
---
Right?! Alliance scum.
---
I kinda feel sorry for people who are going to run this in classic that started in cata. That dungeon is a goddamn maze even if you know the place
---
Nostalgia. Playing exactly what I played on launch
---
No sharding doesn't mean one single server. There can still be just as many servers like in vanilla with a couple of thousand players each.
---
No, not at all. If it was blizzard from 10 years ago id be more optimistic. Now its like, we'll see.
---
So the answer is always +% mana
---
&gt; The logic to determine it was random is quite easy: None of the theories people proposed had any basis in any sort of gameplay we'd seen anywhere else in wow.
---
Who else had an attack comparable to Deep Breath?
---
So, I’d say everything I have seen in the upper comments are true.  My take is PvE all the way.  I’m only into PvP when it is a fair skirmish and I could not really care less about being immersed in a gankfest.
---
I fully support the idea of PvP servers since this brings a real element to some people.  But if I have plans to level and accomplish something in my small finite amount of time, I want to make real progress.  Real life is for inconveniences, games are not.  (For me)
---
As for your husband wanting to do a PvP server, it’s unfortunate to be in a difficult spot like that.  I’d say, have a character on Allies that you play on your own and the Horde one with your partner.
---
I don’t know your time allocation for this, but I level my main with my GF and level my alts when she is not available to play.
---
Dwarf pala lets go
---
Yeah and people seriously believed the two player ogre character as well. But who cares about the opinions of fools
---
After is better
---
i think i fixed it. [Youtube.com/Shneens](https://Youtube.com/Shneens) is my channel just in case
---
You can solve that by f.ex adding a raid with heavy shadow damage to everyone throughout the entire raid, while also requiring good dps and healing, then add other dungeons where you get pieces with actual dps stats as well as shadow res, much like the Nature res gear on world dragons.
---
Not saying this would be the best idea, but it's an option.
---
Every time they increase quality of life they reduce quality of the game.
---
Honestly they should have stopped this BS spoonfeeding of content years ago. 
---
You calling it "retri" instead of "retlord" triggered me. So now I don't want to be in your instance group either.
---
Also, it's DM not VC. Learn how to /who someone. 😡 
---
I'm surprised to see you're not completely braindead. Let's see if your heroine-addict spider fingers are quick enough to grab "bruuhh Swoked brahh haha" on launch day.
---
debatable but I think undead is better for shadow in pvp, devouring plague plus SW:P is a garanteed dead rogue while you kill someone else...
---
Warlocks are farming gods, no matter the spec, only second to mages and hunters. Shadow priests dont farm very well though...
---
Alrighty? Lol
---
Oh certainly not. He's a big dick PvPer! He needs to make fun of you and how you enjoy the game to get his microdick off.
---
So your quote directly supports my point. The classes were designed around class fantasy and not around gameplay.
---
SM/ruin isnt great in PvP. Yes it will work in BGs but since op is mainly about PvP dont recommend a PvE spec... Soul Link or Conflagrate specc is way better in PvP and you can still farm gold better than half of the other classes
---
Yep! Which is why they missed this bug until 2.1!
---
So glad you came around to realizing this wasn't actually intended.
---
&gt; Who else had an attack comparable to Deep Breath?
---
Exactly, especially considering Onyxia was the second raid of what would be a total of what, 6 or so total for Classic WoW? At launch when she was available and people first started raiding her, its not like they had much to compare her mechanics to. EVERYTHING was new back then. Literally.
---
It not surprising to me that people filled in the gaps with guesses. That seems like perfectly normal human nature to me.
---
There's no need to counter the claim, because you have provided no evidence that SoR was meant to replace SotC. Just speculations.
---
yes, I recall using that one back then.
---
But hell, I'M 500 years older now!
---
I wrote a guide about all aspects of wow, which made me think a couple of times if mage was more appealing than lock to me, but no...
---
No way!
---
Is that really how much they took out of ST?
---
&gt;Yeah, we're talking about Vanilla here, keep up.
---
Then why use TBC patch notes as the basis for arguing that SoR should be nerfed in Vanilla? Lmaaaao
---
&gt; Edit: And stop trying to play the elite raider card. 
---
Dude, calm the fuck down. I raided in a casual raiding guild.  You're the talking up elitist bullshit when I'm claiming nothing of the sort.
---
Also, posting a bunch of links doesn't prove what people were thinking. That's selection bias.  The people who didn't get the fight are a lot more likely to post about it than the people who did understand it.
---
And yes I remember arguing with people over these wacky theories.  They were like 911 conspiracy theorists, at some point you just got tired of arguing about their wacky "Jet Fuel can't melting steel beams" and ignored them. 
---
&gt;And here's a link to the actual AMA where Blizzard developer ION describes how once he was hired, the first thing he did was go and check the code to see how deep breath worked, because even as one of the most hardcore raiders in the world back then from the theorycraft haven of Elitist Jerks HE wasnt even certain of how it worked.
---
There's a common problem with nerds, they tend to over think things, which is what happened with Ony's deep breath.  It's can't be that simple! Yet all the facts fit that it was really just that simple.
---
Lets review some of the guides:
---
&gt; Deep Breath - You are given a warning when Onyxia is about to use this ability. She will say "Onyxia begins to take a deep breath". When / If this happens she will stop and breath fire in the direction of the largest crowd. The fire will kill everyone in its path. The only way to avoid this it to not bunch up and if she does call out a deep breath attack to run to the nearest side away from her. 
---
This isn't correct.  Her Deep Breath attacked in a set pattern based on her current room position  When she was flying around there something 5 or 6 positions she would hover at and when/if she deep breathed it would hit the largest segment of the room possible from her current position.  Grouping up had no effect on the area targeted since it was set by Ony's position in the room.  We learned from a guide we found when fighting her.  We tested it, it proved correct everytime and that's what we worked with.
---
The solution was to run the raid to an area outside of her Deep Breath target area, which got really easy once we had icons we could put over players so they could lead the herd out of the way.
---
&gt;After action report one:
---
&gt; Screenshots like these make me want to have a time machine so that I can go back and scream, "YOU FOOLS! WHY ARE YOU PUTTING DOWN TOTEMS?!"(*) I'm now firmly convinced that all pets should be dismissed and all totems destroyed before Phase II. They're just not worth the added risk of triggering a Deep Breath.
---
That's the sort of magical thinking that I find very anoying.  There's no observed mechanic in the game that gives a flying fuck about pets and totems and yet the there is an illogical jump here that concludes something with zero testing.   
---
Randomness special property is you can assign any theory to it that you want and there will be at least one instance where it works.  However, on the next attempt or two, your theory will break down and yet people like this won't give up on their now disproven theory.
---
&gt; because you have provided no evidence that SoR was meant to replace SotC. Just speculations.
---
Thank you! Yes! You're right! Finally, you get it. There's is ZERO evidence that SoR was meant to replace SotC's extra procing utility.
---
Those are patch notes for TBC you dimwit. They have zero relevance on Vanilla.
---
On the other hand. The 1.9 patch notes from VANILLA state this:
---
 
---
* Seal of Righteousness - Now does holy damage on every swing. **It can now proc correctly as well.** The Judgement effect has been renamed "Judgement of Righteousness" to differentiate it from the Seal damage in the combat log.
---
&gt;We might get a stress test / hype builder like a week or 2 before launch.
---
and then wipe? on vanilla?
---
Things is really good. I'd stick to that. Maybe Lofi/chillhop based on vines :p ?
---
its not the gear that makes zg op. its the buffs. 15% on all stats and 50 stamina makes bwl way easier.
---
No need for snide comments. That SotC is meant to be the seal for proccing is pure conjecture on your part. 
---
In fact, the 1.9 patch notes seem to directy counter this hypothesis:
---
Because Kevin Jordan himself, during Esfand's Classicast, pointed out that they dropped the ball on finishing the design for Paladins and didn't really get to fixing everything until after the expansion because class devs were told to focus on TBC instead.
---
You can read more about it in [this bluepost:](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-shaman/668634.htm)
---
&gt; “Right now the class team is heavily focused on the expansion. We will be announcing details of what's in store for each class in the weeks to come. There are a number of improvements we're considering for Shamans in expansion, such as improved totem UI and functionality. I've also been studying the development of new talents and abilities for each class, and so far I'm fairly excited at what I've seen for the Shaman. **Despite the belief that no one reads the Shaman boards (ironically, our loudest forum), we're fully aware of the feedback that's been expressed here**, and will do what we can to address it. Much of the improvement players are demanding will have to wait until the Burning Crusade launches, which isn't too far off.”
---
I agres
---
I played a night elf rogue from vanilla until wotlk. I'll play a tauren shaman when classic is released. 
---
I'm playing a shaman because dungeons are my favorite and as a healer I'll be able to easily get groups. Additionally, ele shamans are great in pvp and enhance is a fun memespec. Originally one of my goals was to get the hand of ragnaros but I'll probably focus on ele. 
---
I picked tauren because I want to play through the horde quests. I like the nature theme of tauren more than the bright orange theme of orcs/trolls. I'll miss Teldrassil and Elwynn as starting zones but I have to go horde this time.
---
You're misreading the patch note. Before 1.9 SoR proced its extra damage **randomly** on each weapon swing. It was changed to make the damage Holy—not just regular damage—and to make that Holy damage proc on every single swing.
---
Im not even sure what that wall of text is trying to say. This discussion started because I stated (And I stand by) the fact that back at that time, it was widely thought that there was a method/trigger to Onyxias deep breath and that it was not widely known that it was 100% random.
---
I posted links specifically from 14 years ago to prove what large swathes of people and individual raiding guilds (that can be verified through wowprogress as having had clear Ony) were thinking. I provided this info because you specifically challenged me to prove that it was widely though that it had a trigger.
---
I did exactly that with mainstream sources, guild sources, and a literal developer source. And now your scolding me for posting them? Not only that you then go on to say 
---
&gt; And yes I remember arguing with people over these wacky theories.
---
Which literally further proves my claim that these theories were widely held back then. The rest of your post is talking about stuff I never contested or made claims on, so Im not even sure what you are looking for there. I made my point, I supported it.
---
I'm going to sleep.
---
&gt; you dimwit.
---
No need for snide comments.
---
Or you designate one player who has done it before as the guide. Put a star mark on him (if it was in the game already at that patch) and follow him. He tells you to jump at the ledge, if you fail, the guide jumps down two and in 2minutes you are up again.
---
The maze isnt that bad. From the layout on the minimap you know you need to go right. If you fail to go at the fastest way, you still end up at Skum and then the flower area. Takes maybe 20minuets longer hacking through trash to get there, but its not like you meet a deadend and just have to backtrack.
---
You mean a wide area AOE targeted by position on a random timer?  Lots of mobs. 
---
Remember conflag in UBRS?  Boss would fire that out in an arc a given size from his body in a given position.  The only differences with deep breaths was the direction Ony faced didn't matter, it was her position in the room that determined where she would launch it.
---
Exploit? People typically skipped the top right boss and went straight for the bottom right boss, but that's about as much skipping as you can do. And I'm fairly certain the top right boss was a rare spawn so it was essentially the natural choice.
---
Besides, the fact that part of the dungeon wasn't done frequently doesn't justify removing it.
---
SM ruin is the prefered Premade spec however. There are most def more than 1 viable spec for pvp. Some examples:
---
Max DMG Battleground Spec

---
Night elf male warrior.
---
Isnt the whole point of wowclassic to re-create the game as it was?
---
If you dont like the old honor system, which is understandable, then maybe classic isnt for you?
---
&gt; I posted links specifically from 14 years ago to prove what large swathes of people and individual raiding guilds (that can be verified through wowprogress as having had clear Ony) were thinking. I provided this info because you specifically challenged me to prove that it was widely thought that it had a trigger.
---
Dude, I can't prove that because I can't travel back in time and ask all the people I talked with to tell you about it.  It's literally an unprovable point in both directions.
---
&gt; I provided this info because you specifically challenged me to prove that it was widely thought that it had a trigger.
---
My point is your assertion doesn't track with what I experienced and you can't prove your assertion via posting links.
---
&gt;Which literally further proves my claim that these theories were widely held back then. 
---
No it doesn't.  Having people go nuts over stupid theories and post the same shit over and over again isn't the same thing as widely held.
---
The biggest difference would be gnomes. Gnomes look like happy fellas in classic rambling about their muderous rampage.
---
In todays WoW they look grumpy and sad with huge drooping eyes like a basset hound.
---
Roleplaying for example would really difficult. 
---
Tauren do not look like they rip you apart like they did in WC3 and vanilla, but straight out of Disney. They look like Goofy.
---
I would be sad if someone sees my character as something totally different than what they are supposed to look like. 
---
I see where you are coming from, but I simply disagree. I oppose mods in shooters too in which on my screen you run around as russians wielding PPSH and on their screen I'm a unicorn. I dont like that.
---
Orc rogue. My first char in vanilla was an undead rogue. He is stil left i perfect pep gear at lvl 60. In bc i restartet as a blood elf warlock and played that char throughout wotlk. Come classic i want to go back to my old main class but want to switch it up with a new race and a swords build this time. My old UD rogue was dagger/backstab spec.
---
The only MMO to do player housing right was Wildstar. RIP. :(
---
I can't recall whether the invisible rabbit thing was actually a thing or not, but it could very well be. The idea was that the invisible rabbits were dummy NPC's for effects and spells. This is actually used very frequently in WC3 as well, where dummy units are typically used in custom maps to apply debuffs or act as special effects (although the latter you can finally do without as of a fairly recent patch). It seems a bit unlikely that WoW would use dummies like that, but honestly back then they totally might've.
---
Good guide! There is also a second camping point I've used with succes. Which is on the little rock formation you stood on for showing the third spawn point, that little hill next to the graveyard. If you use eagle eye you can see all spawn points from that one place. I'm not sure but I think unitscanner also works when using eagle eye.
---
Good guide.
---
There needs to be a beta. Look at the discussion over the Warlock pets despawning as soon as the Warlock starts casting another pet. That discussion got fiery because the Blizz devs said they tested their 1.12 client and found that to be the correct behaviour, but people who had been playing private servers claimed Blizzard was wrong.
---
Through old vanilla PvP videos (Roguecraft series was a big help here) we were able to confirm that Blizzard was right, in classic when a lock started casting a new pet while one was already out, there was no Summoning Sickness stun yet or anything, the existing pet just instantly vanished as soon as the cast started.
---
Theres going to be a lot of little things like this that I expect the community will challenge Blizzard on. A beta would allow us nerds to crawl through all of the available vanilla logs, patch notes and footage to confirm this stuff and calm the playerbase down just because the Private Servers got something incorrect.
---
You would exactly do that, yes absolutely. 
---
If you knew that 50% of the folks are colourblind, you would think twice about getting a blue shirt that looks like purple for lots of folks if you can wear something else thats pleasing to yourself but doesnt look "weird", because you know purple does not fit your teint.
---
Undead Mage in Vanilla, Paladin at the end of Naxx and through TBC.
---
I miss those iterations of Paladin so I'm going back to it. And an OG fire mage will be my alt.
---
Gr8 b8 m8, I r8 8/8
---
Almost every dungeon was gutted in a similar fashion. The confusing parts were what made these places mysterious and interesting/ challenging. In favor of dumbed down content that any dungeon finder pickup can smoke through. 
---
Human rogue, top tier dps'er with basically no raid responsibilities apart from suppression room in BWL. This is ideal as a father of two who might need to ninja afk sometimes during raids if the kids wake up. 
---
It's also relatively gank proof, and if i choose to pvp i can choose my own targets. Will make a hunter or mage alt to farm gold and do tryhard PvP with engineering if i feel like it - havent decided yet which one. Hunters peak early and don't need that much commitment to get pretty good raid gear. Tier 1 and Rhok'delar (Ashjre'thul if lucky) will suffice until people get good AQ gear. Also there is very few upgrades in AQ for hunters, so in mc/bwl level of gears you are very good geared until naxx. On the other hand, mage scales better but will require more time investment to get to absolute top level. 
---
I've had a very similar thought for some time. I feel like the argument that it costs them more money and thus wouldn't be worth it is a pretty poor argument IF you consider the hypothetical situation in which customers who would otherwise leave after one iteration of Vanilla stick around for the progressive servers.
---
Point being, yes it would cost Blizzard a non-0 amount of money more to run both Legacy and Progressive Classic servers, BUT if progressive servers cause more customers to stick around for longer that means more subs and in extention more money. So to say it would be unwise due to the additional cost would be ignoring the increased revenue that would hypothetically be a result of them.
---
I think a lot of people (myself included) aren't simply in love with Vanilla as it was, but the game design and philosophy. I'm a fan of the core of what makes Vanilla Vanilla, not so much the outer exterior parts of it. The reason I don't overly enjoy retail is not because there are zones and raids that weren't in Vanilla, it's because the whole philosophy of the game design is different. It feels like they've sacrificed community on alter of convenience. So yes, I want Classic wow to always be available with no changes as a "museum piece" because frankly it deserves to have that place. However, I would love the idea of more content being added within the design philosophy of Vanilla. That is, more "Vanilla-like" content. Challenging content that requires some level of commitment and community.
---
Why wouldn't you just include loot trading on items that have been rolled greed upon.
---
The ZG buff always persisted through death. 
---
For race I choose the most asthetically pleasing. 
---
You are going to spen over 100 with a character you should enjoy the animations and the style. 
---
For the class I had a specific method. 
---
I KNEW IT! I used to get lost in here for Hours and couldn't understand how. Knew they must of cut half of it.
---
Interesting didnt know there was a spot you could see all spawns. Thank you :)
---
I think i ended up setting an alarm on my phone and i would wakeup throughout the night to check if he spawned....eventually got him at like 3am one morning before work lol !!
---
Honestly, the maze part was quite useless, it only made the dungeon uselessly last longer.
---
That would be a nightmare. I hope the stages are spread out over months. 
---
Up to divine spirit.
---
&gt; feel adding additional levels in expansions was a cheap fix 
---
true
---
&gt;you don't need 60-70 to make the burning crusade expansion work, you can expand on a world and never raise the level cap which would serve in actually expanding a game, not replaceing other content.
---
Still, either:
---
* Outland greens would compete with Naxxramas gear, which would effectively either make old content irrelevant, or make new content accessible only to hardcore raiders
---
or
---
* Outland wouldn't be a post-58 zone, it would be a leveling zone instead. The problem is that it has 6 zones that are as big as Stranglethorn Vale. That would invalidate a lot of leveling content. Also, it has flying mounts...
---
was it the thing with scripts?
---
If my friends and up rolling ally im going female dwarve shadow priest.
---
If horde im going female tauren  30/0/21 ele shamm
---
And the fact that I got trolled by 4 other party members, because they could normally jump there, and I kept jumping and jumping and nothing, they were telling me to jump there instead of where I was jumping, but I couldn't there because of invisible wall or something? IDK, maybe night elves had too big hitbox?
---
Human Pally. I just can't get away from the class, I've always been really attached to it. I love the versatility, aesthetic, the lore, just everything Paladin. 
---
We lost 32bit client tho
---
I see your point, but your aggressiveness might not work. I would try talking to the mage personally, maybe even offer to pass on another item to make the mage pass on a needed wand
---
Well, if we changed the initial idea of 60-70 we would also change the items and quests and what you actually get from there.
---
Big starting raids in outlands could be level of between molten core and blackwing lair. You can expand on gear variability if you don't dumb it down to "Stamina/Spell damage/Attack power". Especially if say this was a expansion that opened up a additional tree for each race specific class. Along with lots of balance on current ones. (rather then giving horde pallies and alliance shamans)
---
I think outlands would still be able to be a post level 58 world. The idea would come down to what additional things can we add while keeping current content balances around it.
---
Warlock is super useful in a premade, while spriest is completely pointless and no serious group will ever invite one.
---
Giving gear to a spriest before AQ is like throwing it away and besides unlike warlock the priest needs two different kinds of gear for pvp and pve.
---
I never played Horde when I joined the game in late 2006 and would love to have an authentic Vanilla experience, so Shaman just seemed like the right choice.  And female Tauren are just too cute to pass up this time around... I'm an odd one.
---
If this is bait I fell for it so hard. I event went babymode on him.
---
&gt; Well, if we changed the initial idea of 60-70 we would also change the items and quests and what you actually get from there.
---
that would mean TBC completely overhauled into a series of content patches, not an expansion.
---
&gt; Big starting raids in outlands could be level of between molten core and blackwing lair.
---
Do you mean buffing BWL and higher tiers loot?
---
&gt; Especially if say this was a expansion that opened up a additional tree for each race specific class.
---
you mean racial talents? Or, Guardian spec for Druids?
---
OR are you talking about something like sockets or third trinket slot?
---
&gt; I think outlands would still be able to be a post level 58 world.
---
but still it would caused a content overwhelm, like today's leveling in 20-80. I'd say it would be better to release individual raids, and maybe zones, as patches. But not the entire big outland mixing into everything.
---
This is really cool. I wonder what Draenor would look like now if Blizzard had managed to complete it as level 60 content.
---
It was very obvious b8. I’m reading the comments laughing at how pathetic you cry baby’s are. Even if he was serious, it’s still nothing to get mad at, I actually thought it was funny and a good banter moment. Lighten up you fucking weeks! 
---
Mage because it is the best class.
---
I’ve analysed every class and have come to the conclusion that Mage is the best class, but not by a wide margin.
---
This is exactly as I feel. Articulated very well.
---
For those who want an exact replica of Vanilla - I do really want that to exist for them. They deserve it.
---
If that's all that is ultimately made, then I will still be very happy that Classic happened.
---
But I can't help but imagine more. As you said, it was game design and philosophy of Vanilla that I loved not the exact game.
---
Try out a few classes on a pserver to get a feel for what you might like to play when Classic comes out. 
---
There is only one person who knows the answer to that question.
---
I completely agree, I mean I'd really want to have no sharding.
---
However, there were around 200 000 players on Vanilla launch. There will be around 10x as many on Classic launch. There were around 90 servers on Vanilla launch. Blizzard will not release *900* servers for Classic.
---
The real solution would be to ask a one time fee for Classic. That would cut down on the "tourist" numbers immensely. (And if there were preorders, it would give a nice prediction for Blizzard to know how many servers to launch.) Of course Blizzard don't want it, they want everyone with a WoW subscription to have access. And people would be upset. (The few times it was suggested on forums, there were outrage. "You want me to pay *again*?? I've already bought Vanilla!"
---
So sharding it will be.
---
Tauren druid. I'm going to be a druid and there isn't any alternative races. I have a lot of pride as a boomkin, and even if it isn't viable in classic, I just can't accept not being druid, in case it would be viable.
---
I'll be main tanking on Alliance.
---
So Human Warrior.
---
Priests best 1v1 class in the game
---
Ogres in the SE camp primarily. Off the beaten path from duskwood-swamp, but still accessible for the curious low-level
---
most rogues, at least the serious ones will be dwarf, so your dp will be wasted. also jungle remedies.
---
Honestly I believe there should be a Beta, but I also believe we won't get one and that people will end up pointing out inconsistencys for months.
---
I think it'll harm Classic in its early life but smooth out eventually. 
---
I thought a message notifying everyone in the party that a trade occurred solves the secret abuse problem. It's up to players to treat it like ninja looting or accept it as part of the system
---
Night elf druid:
---
Previously I played mage in vanilla, wanted to do smth else. I want to play a rare class with lot of versatility and support. Druid fits this the best. I don't like horde, so shaman was also out.
---
I was going to go with my favorite class NE Hunter, but because I want to raid primarily, its **very** important to me that I thoroughly enjoy my mains Raiding Spec inside of raids, and outside of them...
---
I know from experience that it sucks to have to constantly burn all your gold on respecs to enjoy PvE outside of raiding, or PvP. While I love Hunters, I love the BM spec specifically the most and not MM, and also I don't like the way Hunters scale in PvE after BWL.
---
Warlocks though, they scale well, their two main raiding specs are a blast in all faucets of the game (IMO) and its my second fav class so. Im going Warlock.
---
Let me guess, you tryhard the game on private servers? That would explain the toxicity. 
---
Hi, /u/theycallmeLEV
---
In tbc I swear I was one of the 1st players to catch on to farming motes with the tankatronic goggles, this was before the patch that would highlight them on your minimap, i would fly around nagrand farming khorium/ adamantite and finding random gas clouds, using mats to make gyro balanced khorium destroyer.
---
Rogue. Can't kill if you can't move or cast. 
---
For me I'm waiting.
---
If i go on a private server I'll burn myself out on starting zones, damage the experiance of classic and take away from the freshness and hype come summer.
---
Most people I know that played this game and loved it so they play more, more and more wish that they could wipe there memory so they can get that feeling of playing it for the first time. You have that chance in doing that, so dont wasted it on a private server would be my opinion.
---
&gt; There hasn’t been a good Blizzard game in 10 years.
---
Both Overwatch and Hearthstone are very well crafted games that a tonne of people enjoy.  
---
While I utterly disagree with Blizzard-Activisions revenue models and corporate dishonesty, they can still craft well functioning games.
---
It's on a 30s CD...
---
And I would like "It's a small world after all!" music when you are in the cart. 
---
NE druid just like i did back in the day :D but now I actually going to train all the feral abilities and play resto at endgame instead of balance
---
**WAIT**
---
I'd even suggest avoiding guides and the like.
---
It's very rare that you get to be a noob these days. I highly recommend going in nearly blind and enjoying the fresh experience.
---
Also, by starting on a pserver you'll likely spoil the experience for yourself and maybe even deal with burn out by the time Classic comes out.
---
I waited for over 10 years, hoping, dreaming for Blizz hosted vanilla servers. I'm just happy they are finally doing it. 
---
PLS BLIZZ HURRY!
---
I'm looking forward to that stupid laugh and dwarven dance over my corpse. 
---
Let the circle of hate begin! - Summer '19
---
I've been an undead rogue from day one. Nothing is changing. I love being in control during a fight. Fight starts when I'm ready and on my terms. If I'm caught out, I have options to get away. It's just a sense of power imo. 
---
I have to decide faction first. FML.
---
Well. (sorry im not as organized in response but i'll still respond in order)
---
Ya. I think it would be a overhaul. If you look at TBC design now and vanilla design the games are not the same. It was already a game that was designed to follow chain questing. This is seen in draenei and blood elf starting zones and all of TBC. The entire world was designed around this. So if blizzard went forward from classic and classic was a success. This would have to be overhauled.
---
To the second question, I don't mean buffing second loot, possibly changing, but not buffing. Spell damage and attack power can be removed first off. We would go back to specific attributes (Holy damage, healing, Shadow damage, Fire damage etc). That alone would dramatically diversify gear. Say Maybe outlands has a lot of really sick arcane and shadow gear. Molten core fire obviously, Naxxramax and blackwing lair have sick shadow and cold and fire. Different tiers of different attributes. This can be expanded more to if it was a design choice.
---
The third question, I mean like when you open your talent tree as a druid say there is Resto/Balance/Feral. Well, in TBC if you roll as a Tauren druid you would have Resto/Balance/Feral/Spiritwalker Night elf druid would go Resto/Balance/Feral/Raven or something (ancient of wind theme). It could have a different tree layout to maybe enable other trees, or be its own seperate spellbook section.
---
As for the last thing, ya, I think releasing the world outlands would be good. I actually just made a recent thread about that idea to cause i like thinking on this stuff. You don't need to pour all raids, all dungeons, but you can start with a new world to explore, some new dungeons, new spells to farm, new factions, new races, new starting zones, a new profession. Arenas as an extension to battlegrounds and Worldpvp. ETC.
---
I agree that the \_20% on PoH is great, but you cant get them in this build, it is a tier to high in the talent list
---
Biggest advice is make sure you now how to hamstring kite to kill mobs.  Will save you a lot of downtime. 
---
Ret was pretty good horde side in tbc given the gear and getting put in the melee group.  I convinced my guild back then to let me go ret, and nothing was more satisfying than beating the rogue who opposed it on dps. 
---
It is a thing: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Bunny_triggers
---
Right. My mistake. While I think about: 2 in improved poh and getting just 6% additional healing might be the way to go then.
---
Ret was solid horde side.  Kind of gear defendant, but given you got put in a good group it was great.  Wind fury and seal of blood was pretty strong. 
---
My first character was on a PvP server. I didn't like it, switched to a PvE server and it is indeed a different game. I'm only interested in the PvE content of the game. In interacting with the community (without killing them).
---
When you play on a PvP server, it's the other players decision what your going to play today. You might just want to chill with some quests and end up in a PvP battle. That's up to personal preference. If you like the unexpected, that's fine.
---
After a day at work, doing what my company wants me to do, I want to spend the evening doing what I want to do. Not what some other player forces me to do. That's why I will never ever again play a game on a PvP server.
---
For your situation. Moving items between factions isn't really easy nor cheap. Why don't you play the shaman with your husband on a PvP server and the druid on a PvE server?
---
If rogue gets opener and you do not land death coil you lose.
---
That is pretty much it, every other scenario warlock should win.
---
yeah except AH fees u lose like 15 or so
---
Dalaran too, maybe. And a dungeon in Duskwood? 
---
Maybe one more related question
---
Do you expect people on PVP servers doing also PVE content (raids, etc.) or do you expect, that the community will be divided to PVE people on PVE servers doing PVE stuff and PVP servers only for people enjoying city raids, battlegrounds and world PVP?
---
Well yeah, I never thought Feral Druid could be as high as other damage dealers, but I'm just saying it doesn't seem to be nearly as bad as people thought back then.  What I thought to be true and always wanted to say back then is that a great Feral Druid should end up better than a mediocre Rogue or maybe even Mage.
---
Then again, somehow using one or two spells and skills a lot was somehow considered "good" back then, so I guess it's all relative.  Eh, still, I refer back to what I said.
---
It will release on July 16th and here is why:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/
---
&gt; no worries mate
---
I just always type a lot, lol.  So don't worry.
---
So yeah, I did feel weird for a moment, but I know how it feels to get that kind of angry, so it's okay.  What they did was intended to cause exactly that kind of visceral reaction, and that's now the ultra-annoying part to me, not as much the actual crashing part anymore.  Honestly, I still sometimes struggle to not react like that to certain things online, mostly political or on that level, so I get it.  Perhaps if this was presented in a funny way I'd feel differently, but they were trying their hardest to basically just get themselves off with the video.
---
While I agree an ELO system would be a better Honor System from the start, I think we have to respect the (albeit unhealthy) system that was in place at launch. 
---
You cannot amend what is already there without opening the door to other changes: If you think it is unhealthy to gain some serious ranks because of the time you have to invest in your progression towards that goal, what is keeping us from implementing a system that automatically find groups for dungeons because you think it is unhealthy to sit in SW/Org spamming the LFG channels?
---
My skill to complete a dungeon is not the only factor in how well I can receive rewards from that dungeon and that's fine. My skill to compete in PVP is not the only factor in how well I can receive rewards from PVP and that should be fine as well. It sucks, but it's better that way for all of us.
---
Playing on a PvE server is a weird experience. Because you can't interact with the other faction in a meaningful way you just sort of exist near each other.
---
There's kind of no reason for the other faction to even appear in your world on a PvE server since they don't have any purpose.
---
PLEASE.
---
Level slowly. Take time to explore Azeroth and make friends along the way. There will be a day where you want to go back but you can't. So take this time and do it slow.
---
That's actually a real solution to the problem. We should get it into Blizzard's ear somehow...
---
No it isn't ready, they have to prepare the client for a bunch of future microtransactions and quality of life features, that can take time!
---
I've never used one but I'm known for getting off track. I think I might stick to Joana's guide this time.
---
&gt; Can't wait to have dungeons we have to explore again!  
---
Nice meme. Almost all of them are linear corridors.  
---
I'm excited for Wailing Caverns. The only vanilla dungeon that I have trepidation even thinking about is BRD. That's a dungeon I'm going to do the bare minimum number of times.
---
I want some strategy and some CC, a sense of teamwork, the constant risk of wipes (but with a good team to avoid those wipes), and a little bit of RNG, and at the end of it I want good loot that goes to someone in the team that deserves it, even if that person is not me.
---
I don't want a 30-minute AOE linear zerg, and I also don't want a 9-hour slog with constant wipes, getting lost, and replacing half the team before you finish.
---
I think \~2hrs is the sweetspot for any dungeon, \~3hrs for any raid. Not too long, not too short, but just right.
---
Hooray for WC, for SFK, for Scholo, for Strat, for LBRS and UBRS. I am looking forward to reacquainting myself with you all.
---
I might use a quest guide to some extent. Like knowing where to go for which level. But I am not gonna use a quest addon, or follow a guide step by step.
---
I want to play classic and feel like I am playing an RPG again. Mindlessly running through the world following a guide would destroy the feeling I want.
---
Just play boomkin if you like it. 
---
Wait for Classic. Don't exhaust yourself in the tough and hard grinding process on a private server, especially from 1 to 40. The time spent is not worth, because most of those servers will be gone in summer. 
---
Totally forgot about that. Sadly I will play Tauren so rep for mounts will be a none issue.
---
My orc had an undead mount back in the day.
---
Had to grind tons rune cloth. 
---
Spot on
---
Or... you know... maybe they will also add the convenient token... after all, it's just to lessen the burden on their GMs.
---
There are changes I could swallow. Loot trading is none of them.
---
Your talent for argument and coherence is staggering...
---
Yours is easily exploitable. A greedy group could make a medium amount of gold. You just need on your buddy's item in case he looses, because at least you can vender it rather than a pug getting some much needed gear.
---
Slightly more risky, you could also try to sell it to the person you ninja'd it from.
---
Wasn't the stages just suggestions?
---
You thought the devilsaur mafia was bad? Just wait until an actual housing market is implemented.
---
&gt;rape dwarf face
---
Huh, and I thought I was the only one calling this exact face the 'rape face', lmao. I never really played dwarf, but if I ever do, I'm rolling a bald rape faced dark gray dwarf, so strike fear into my enemies' hearts.
---
Try the pserver, first of all make sure you like the game before spending money on it.  Think of the pserver like the beta stage.
---
Familiarise yourself with the mechanics, quest areas etc
---
Honestly, they should never started it.
---
And they started it in...TBC, the expansion that I considered "better" than Vanilla. Well, TBC is actually the one that is being seen with rose tinted glasses, because TBC was THE START of the downfall of WoW.
---
Numerous QOLs from TBC are the cause of pretty much everything bad in WoW.
---
Yes, increase QOL = reduce quality of game.
---
And it all started in TBC.
---
Main reason I do not want to see TBC after Classic : it was the expansion that delivered the first blow to WoW community, content and game quality.
---
&gt;Would you have an issue if I used a client side mod to make your character a naked night elf with my favorite hair and skin color?  
---
I wouldn't. Because I can't tell what you're doing. Nor would I care. 
---
&gt;This is an MMORPG. I want my character to look the way I made it.
---
Especially for some races and faces, the retail models are significantly different.
---
When I wear certain armor and tabards, pick certain faces and hair, I want it to look the way I chose.  
---
Yea. Cool. They are gonna look just the way you made them. What makes you think otherwise.  
---
Sad truth is, it doesn't matter if I'd be using a QuestHelper or not, I'm going to be on auto-pilot anyways. I have leveled so many characters during classic, tbc and wrath that - to this date - I still know the full leveling routing out of my head including all hidden questgivers, escort quests, drop-quests, etc... It's funny how the brain works. I know all of that shit but trying to remember to buy eggs and milk at the grocery store seems to be an impossible task...
---
Mechanically, it's no different. The atmosphere however is different. Groups happen more readily. People gather in an area where the other faction has been active and there's a visceral reaction to seeing opposing faction members in the world.
---
There is this addon ShaguQuest, guess now its called pfQuest. but its the same addon pretty much.
---
Basically it adds "Show" button under each quest. So you can manually decide to show some particular quest objective on the map, if you decided to.
---
What it lets you do is to quest without quest helper info on the map to get this full emersion, but when some quest is especially annoying, or you don't want to deal with it atm, or you arent feeling it atm etc. you can spoil it for yourself and show it on the map.
---
So its a very nice middle ground addon. Unlike questie which feels your map with all the quests info automatically.
---
but you don't and can't know unless they tell you  
---
so you're just spouting nonsense lol  
---
Great list, thanks. I'm planning to level an enchanter, and what this makes very clear to me is that while the Lesser and Greater Magic wands will be best DPS for their level, and in big demand, the Lesser and Greater Mystic ones will be upgrades for far fewer people as there are many drops at about the same level that out-perform them. I'll have to be cautious about making too many mystic wands.
---
(That said, even if they sell at cost it'll be nice to get some "free" level-ups on mid-level enchanting.)
---
I think I've raided Onyxia (in the original Vanilla) at least 70 times. There is absolutely nothing that triggers Ony DB. 
---
It just randomly happens. We had runs with anything between 1 and 7 Ony DB. Funny is that the runs with more than 4 DBs were the runs that were much better executed than the runs with 1 or 2 DBs.
---
I played a Hunter from vanilla launch until WoD. My one lingering frustration with that was being unable to get into groups in a timely manner because I was a pure DPS class. Standing around cities for ages trying to get into groups is not great fun.
---
So I decided to play a tank/heal hybrid to have a better dungeon experience.
---
I'm Horde for life, so my only tank/heal hybrid available is Druid. The only Horde race for Druid is Tauren.
---
So I'll be playing a Tauren Druid.
---
I have legit never seen a post about hair color here.
---
Even that would be better imo than 100 posts about "what comes after naxxramas"... 
---
It'll be my first time (well, I've tried the game on private servers, I know I like it). It's not even a question. I'll not use any addons. (Maybe some when it comes to raiding.)
---
Of course I'll taking it slow. I've even created a guild for like minded people. :)
---
This has the side benefit that I can experience a wide variety of playstyles without playing alts - I can focus all my attention on my main throughout.
---
Does this sub even have mods?
---
Depends on what you want to do. You can't transfer items between horde and alliance anyway so it's a moot point (unless you sell stuff to yourself but it's pretty situational). 
---
If you mainly want to play PVE and aren't interested in PVP then play on a PVE server. All the tryhard toxic shitty little kids play on PVP servers so you can avoid most of them by playing PVE. RP-PVE is another alternative (very few people roleplay) since server populations are lower and there are even less edgelords that will dedicate their entire day to make sure you can't play the game.
---
If you like world PVP though and the concept of always being in danger, then play on PVP servers. You do need to realise however that 99% of all PVP encounters you will have will put you in a position where it's basically not possible to win if you're alone. If you're always playing with your husband it's another matter, but it will only bring the number down to 90% of encounters since most, if not all, PVP encounters in WoW is a max level player killing you or an entire group of people ganging up on you.
---
Fair PVP fights out in the world are incredibly rare.
---
Me?
---
Almost as good as tauren rogues
---
Let’s just call it “The Wailing Caverns” for nothing, then. 
---
pfQuest is amazing.
---
It also adds accurate spawn points to your map/mini map to show you exactly where something should be. Rather than the vague map markers that Questie adds.
---
As well as having many other amazing features.    
---
Like being able to look up anything (quests, items, mobs, npcs, objects, etc.) in it's built in data base.    
---
You can even look up things like the spawn points for every chest in the zone you're in.
---
-
---
Unfortunately I don't think Shagu has plans on porting it to Classic.    
---
He said he's not going to be porting pfUI at least.
---
So hopefully someone else makes something similar.    
---
But until then, I'll just have to have wowhead open on the 2nd screen for anything that's not already burned into my memory.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=4368](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4368)
---
I disagree strongly about an additional charge just to keep the riff raff out.
---
I'd rather people try it. So what if they're "tourists"?
---
Before 1.9 you could
---
    /join General - Ironforge
---
which was as good as world chat.
---
I am seriously hoping they end up releasing the old client with the new models. The old ones were hideous.
---
Mr T is going to play a Night Elf Mohawk. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1vF3-BsoxE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1vF3-BsoxE)
---
They're out buying phones. 
---
I conservative by nature. My main in Classic will be the same as it was for 15 years : Orc Warrior, as a tank (hopefully MT or OT in a top guild).
---
It is the race, class and role I know the best, and the best suited for my personality.
---
One small change I will do will be on my alts.
---
I will have a healer alt, which I didn't had in Vanilla.
---
I used QH in the past but I'd rather don't in Classic. I do want to play it for a long time after all so I should refrain from "skipping" content.
---
I wont be using QH addons. For the same reasons you state, Id like to be immersed. 
---
Runescape pays your wow subscription?
---
Yeah, it's called "common sense", which lately seems to be missing a lot.  
---
What they are saying is absolutely right.  
---
They are not saying "I want every other player to look like a pink elephant", they are saying "I don't care how **you** want to see everyone, because it does not affect me or my game-play, and conversely you should not care about how **I** want to see everyone, because it does not affect you or your game-play."
---
Undead Warlock.
---
Not having to save for a mount the first time lvling up is seriously helpful.
---
They're also one of the easiest people to lvl. Gonna power lvl for a week get to 50ish and then just enjoy arsing around on one or two alts, do some professions
---
&gt; Yea. Cool. They are gonna look just the way you made them. What makes you think otherwise.
---
Because, to them, the old model for X is not like the new model for X, so you are "depriving them of their desired looks."
---
Personally, I only want a nice not too high, not too low pop realm for my guild and myself. (This must be with original population cap. The world is fucked with too many people in it.) Otherwise, yes, why would I mind that it's easier for people to try and play Classic?
---
However, if everyone can come, there is no way around sharding and potentially very unbalanced servers. It's ok if most people try the game then leave (as Blizzard predicts), leaving a healthy server pop. But what if more people leave? Or *fewer*? Having an overpopulated server is even worse for me than an underpopulated.
---
But it's all moot. Just like I said, neither Blizzard nor most people would accept my solution (and I don't see better). So, there will be sharding.
---
The only "funny" thing about it that people on this sub are *both* against sharding *and* paying a one time fee. Which is completely contradictory. :)
---
Yeah they take 15%, but you can avoid that by buying an expensive item on alliance ah, put it for 1g on the neutral ah, take it with your horde char and sell it for the same price on horde ah.
---
Be aware that it can be risky, if someone see the item for 1g and get it you are screwed so you have to be fast and check if no one is around the goblin ah.
---
&gt; But still, I'm against a toggle option. Why? Because this is a living world where the actions and decisions of the players around you matter. It's important that everyone in the game is on the same page, even in regards to looks.
---
Allow me to disagree, here.  
---
You will **never** have everyone on the same page, **especially** in regards to looks.  
---
I am looking forward to classic, I want again to purchase components for my mage's spells, arrows for my hunter, and having to care about his pets.  
---
But I don't look forward to the outdated graphics, I'd like to play with the new models and, hopefully, having the back toggle for Orcs.
---
I will probably go tauren druid.  
---
Friend will roll Horde, so I'm following him there. I like stealth, but I don't want to be just a DMG option class. Got no issues with healing should I ever get to raiding. And following another faction player in a contested area when I know there are players from the other side and just pop out from stealth to save his ass is something I like to do
---
I would advice you to try, casually, a private server.
---
I always refused to play on private servers, because there was no point in doing it...but when Blizzard announced Classic, suddenly there were plenty of reasons to play on private servers, like :
---
\-I wanted to see if nostalgia is going to make me feel bored of a game I already played extensively. It wasn't. 
---
\-I wanted to see how much I remember. A LOT I didn't remembered.
---
\-I wanted to see if I can be competitive enough on a private server, considering I haven't touched Vanilla for the last 10 years. Yes, I was still competitive enough.
---
\-I wanted to see if the community quality is like it was back in Vanilla. Yes, it is basically the same.
---
Vanilla WoW is a game created for ETERNITY. You can play it anytime you want, and the effect on you will be almost the same every time.
---
Do it. Play on a private server, it will NOT chip off the feeling of novelty when you will start Classic.
---
I cannot wait for Classic, because my characters will exist as long as Blizzard exists.
---
Which is the best I can hope for.
---
&gt; a dungeon in Duskwood?
---
where?
---
I only played Humans in the past but I kinda came to like Dwarves so I'll probably roll a Dwarf Warrior (unless they fix Night Elf ear clipping with helms in the Classic client, I do find them cool as well but the ears are a no go unless I can hide them properly).
---
&gt; It was already a game that was designed to follow chain questing.
---
Vanilla was too. The thing is questing in TBC was more QoL-oriented - for example "kill 10 warriors and 10 mages" was turned into "kill 20 of any", and also there were a lot less quests that involved traveling back and forth - basically, in TBC, you would leave the quest hub only when you're done, and never return.
---
and what precious did they drop?
---
Your primary reason being on the same server is to transfer resources? So being able to actually play together isnt a priority lol?
---
PvP server is worth it as long as you can understand that the wPvP isn't "fair".
---
If you think you gonna be frustrated because a high level camped you, or 5~6 people went against you alone, please don't be one of the crybabies that complain about that, and stick to PvE servers.
---
instanced housing is not really the right way though
---
The more people playing classic who go in blind, the better. Old vets who don't want to rush and instead take in the game slowly will greatly appreciate people like that.
---
I like Mage PvP, so naturally I will roll Undead and pick up Engineering.
---
druid, because i recently played it a bit, and enjoyed a lot. Also healing is imho the most chill role, or at least the one I am confident in the most, and I can also tank 5 mans as bear if I want to (bear tank is very easy compared to warrior). And I enjoy being an annoying unkillable nuisance in PvP. Even if it competitively was only used as flag carrier, even in AB/AV I can just entangle, heal, and if focused I can run/tank it. Might not be the best, but its hella fun and annoying for the enemy.
---
And the race was obviously set once I decided on druid (My life for the Horde). Although I must admit I will miss being an orc a bit (I played orc shaman back in TBC).
---
MEGADUNGEON!!!!11!1
---
Experience.   
---
I leveld to 60: 
---
\- 3 shamans
---
\- 1 rogue
---
\- 2 mages
---
\- 4 warriors
---
And after leveling them to 60 I always went back to leveling a warrior, so I know that I wont do the mistake again to level some class that I wont stick to. Warrior will be the class I main - again - in classic.
---
It started with the prepatch for tbc.  Suddenly no one wanted to raid any more because everyone was able to PvP for easy epics.  Who wants to put in The effort to raid when you can get spoon-fed purples?
---
Played a warrior since vanilla, always will :)
---
vanilla had a lot of quests that could chain, but there was a lot of grinding intention. You can't confuse "QoL" Vs "Quest that gives a reason to grind here" They originally wanted quests to introduce you to places, and then for you to simply grind. It was later in development realized people wanted more quests to level with. BC and belf/draenei starting zone remove all grinding options. You can level in vanilla with only grinding fairly quick
---
Aan yeah, once you know the respawn it gets easier. You ask around in Badlands when was the last time someone tamed him and then you start to calculate.
---
But pservers have changed there spawn times according to the population when it was last tamed/killed. For example if the population is above 8k they half the spawn rate. Don't know the exact number. Recently one pservers just changed it all together to a fixed number. It's going to be a challenge when classic comes around. I just hope they don't normalize the attack speed.
---
In Azshara, they were seemingly going to do a DotA-style Battleground called Azshara Crater, but I forget if maybe that was going to be for TBC or Wrath.
---
Hmm I thought I read somewhere that it was a zone that was meant to have a dungeon because of the lack of dungeons in alliance zones.
---
You miss out on content by not going pvp. If you go a pve server, worldbosses aren't really a thing like they are on pvp servers, and it's incredible.
---
Just half a year, it's not that much time.
---
Playing on a pserver which you will abandon that soon looks pointless to me.
---
I think it doesn't fit with WOW. Would fit for some medievals, perhaps. Witcher, Mount&amp;Blade, and such.
---
I'm not sure I understand the reason why so many people seem to be of the opinion that there is no need for a beta. Unless I'm mistaken, they are porting the entire 1.12 database to a completely different client. Wouldn't there be a very real need to test and ensure that everything was ported and functioning correctly after such a complex process?
---
Broken tooth will be obsolete in classic as the servers will be 1.12.1 where his attack speed is the same as the other cats. 
---
you mean alliance getting stockades, blackfathom deeps, and Duskwood dungeon, while horde having nothing for that level range?
---
Yeah, if everyone is paying attention and you survive the first DB, you can just keep doing it.
---
The curve ball where there's one deep breath after people fall asleep at the keys is the problem.
---
Gimme that sweet frontflip and moonwalk
---
They "shouldnt" since attack speed normalization was not in during vanilla but the TBC prepatch.
---
Patch 1.9 was both normalization of pet RUN SPEED (not attack) and only physical damage is dealt (lupos nerf). If blizzard...keeps it blizzlike....broken tooth is the best dps pet in game/son of thakkar 
---
I always play melee characters with magic capabilities, that's why my favorite class in Warcraft is the Deathknight. Unfortunately there won't be any to play in Classic WoW, so I will play the next best "Battlemage/Spellblade/Red Mage" class, which would be the enhancement shaman. For race it is quite simple: My favorite race, the Pandaren, aren't available so I play my second favorite race, the Darkspear Trolls.
---
Undead warrior with troll Hunter leveled slowly with rested.
---
Female orc shaman
---
- I'm a shaman main since tbc ( was alliance in vanilla )
---
- orc racial Op in pvp
---
- male orcs looks bad
---
Right but my husband and I could buy from each other.
---
UD mage , no way im skipping out on the freelo class this time around
---
If you play on a pve server you will miss out on a lot of content, a big part of the lvling experience revolves around interacting with the other faction, you either start a war or you tolerate each other or help each other with the quests. 
---
At max lvl pvp will still be a big part of the game as you have to fight for herbs, ores and skinning or fight in order to get to the dungeons and raids. 
---
If you played on opposite faction you wouldnt interract with your hubs as you cant do dungeons or raids together, which is pretty much the only reason people choose a pve server
---
Do you want to melt faces? Or be a muchroom?
---
My first time all around- I only played on the vanilla demo. 
---
Human Rogue. I mean, cmon. I was never into dwarfs as I am pretty tall human being. Night Elves are kinda cool but Demon Hunters came in Legion, durids are cool with transformations but that was it. I like RPing as badass thug who simple doesn't give a fck and goes after money and hoes. I also was really interested in Edwin VanCleef persona. He was a rogue, he had some cool backstory, skills, epic ship, reasons to get mad and relaly cool blackguards. I also like pirates. I fell in love with Outlaw Rogue in Legion but they made him weaker over time and changed some cool abilities. If I wouldn't play Human I would play Blood Elf Mage/Paladin but those are for TBC. I liked Kael'thas character in War3. Undead Rogue is cool but visuals aren't there. I used to play some of it but still prefer Human race, Deadmines, Westfall area. Rogue has also have other type of attacks like openers, finishers, combo points and many tricks up their sleeves. Pickpocketing monsters while questing, opening locks, vanishing from enemy sight, throwing powder to their eyes and blinding them, using poisons to make their enemies weaker, more vulnerable. 
---
Yes. 100%. No one in this thread understands software development.
---
The whole concept of skill cap is that if you are playing at the highest possible level then you will have an edge over others if your class has a higher skill cap. (skill cap = chance to be stronger than your opponent class if you play perfect)
---
I like that suggestion, thanks!
---
&gt; rolling Classic in with Live allows them to sneakily insert WoW tokens into Classic
---
Keep in mind that *retail* is the flagship version for Blizzard, the real purpose of rolling Classic together with is not the token, but:
---
1 - give *retail* players something to do during content droughts so they hopefully won't unsub as fast as they do now after each patch.
---
2 - have a massive influx of tourists, *on purpose*, not only from retail but also from outside, so after most of them have seen how "harder" vanilla is compared to modern MMOs, maybe they'll try retal *before quitting* since the sub is the same, and maybe even spend some money on the shop while at it.
---
You wouldn't be able to do those 2 things with a separate sub.
---
Yes, those decisions look terrible from OUR point of view of dedicated fans BUT they are incredibly well thought instead from a **business** point of view, and if Classic didn't look profitable for *their business* we wouldn't have it at all, no matter how passionate we can be.
---
There's a reason the honor system gets delayed, it has way to powerful gear rewards. Especially with 1.12 itemisation. 
---
Rogues always have the opener
---
Social media is so much more prevalent now and people like fueling the flames of Drama, Blizzard is different, but they aren't THAT much different. Blizzard has always made mistakes, Mobile Diablo itself isn't a bad idea, mobile is huge and lots of people like mobile titles but where and how they announced it was poorly planned. They've all but admitted they're working on Diablo 4 and if the rumors are to be believed they've been working on it for years and restarted it mutliple times (and taking their time/restarting if needed is absolutely Blizzard like yet people complain that they're taking tooo much time)
---
Hots isn't dying, they're just exiting the Esports scene (and no, no esports scene doesn't mean the game is dead). Retail WoW has gone in another direction that I'm not particularly a fan of, I can't even play first person shooters but from what I've heard overwatch is a pretty great game and I'm still quite a fan of hearthstone.
---
Blizzard's always made mistakes, I also loved Rock'n'Roll racing and have been a fan of them for as long, but their pre-cursor to that was hot garbage called RPM racing. Starcraft wasn't even that great until Brood wars and several patches in when they finally balanced the game and Diablo 1's online service was a clusterfuck of hackers and cheaters which basically made it unplayable in public.
---
Just hearing the Blizzard folks at Blizzcon who are working on Classic make me feel like there's still a lot of old Blizzard there and I haven't become nearly as jaded or bitter as a lot of the fan base seems to be.
---
I'm not sure what to expect. I guess I didn't expect it to be as big of a factor, but from reading these comments it seems like its pretty indicative of your experience and a literal game changer.
---
That kind of testing is typically done in-house.
---
Beta tests are more for getting feedback on things like the design.
---
But the game has already been designed. We're well passed that.
---
Lol well it is. If all our characters are same side we can mix and match for parties.
---
Dualbox tauren druids. Once im. High level, use 2nd account to out of party kill mobs tagged by my main accounts alts, smashing through quests to level them quick
---
Ice cold- I'm new here. I just didn't know if my husband was exaggerating the difference in experience.
---
Didn't you read my post?
---
&gt; They originally wanted quests to introduce you to places, and then for you to simply grind. It was later in development realized people wanted more quests to level with.
---
but still, many of vanilla quest were sending you here and there, back and forth. Even leveling ones. In TBC, this was too much optimized - questing felt more like a task with trackable progress, than an adventure.
---
&gt; You can level in vanilla with only grinding fairly quick.
---
naturally, because XP rate is low. But it is still faster to take a few quests in that area, get them to ready-for-turn-in, and just continue grinding.
---
&gt; It affects a lot of aspects of gameplay when you remove grinding altogether. If it's only chain, then you actually seperate players apart more.
---
well, all they did was replaced grind with additional quests. It is basically the same gameplay, you just have to return to the questgiver, instead of killing 10 more mobs. The thing is, in TBC, those "grindkillers" were almost all leveling quests. TBC basically lacked that "unusual" quests, just had less of them. Basically effort cutting. More was schematic and following the standard pattern, less was extraordinary. Which made questing feel like a "task" or "process".
---
In vanilla, there were a bit more of the diversity in questing, and it was just enough to make the entire questing feel like an "adventure". In vanilla, one didn't basically distinguish between "leveling quest" and "story quest". 
---
It's like flying from America to China. In most parts of America, there is a wide diversity of people, all mixed and packer together. But once you land in China, you'll notice that almost everyone looks Asian. Then, those white or black would be your story quests, and China would be your Outland. 
---
And finally, you are moving to Africa, and are so excited about that exotic women. But years later, you are already sick of that begging for money, and also find out that you got AIDS and are doomed. That's retail WOW.
---
&gt; I only played on the vanilla demo
---
I assume you played some other Blizzard games then, am I right?
---
Hmm, have you played any MMORPG recently?
---
That is true, but I wanted to only have a scenario with good gear, because before you get all your stuff its just too many random scenarios to be able to look at it clearly.
---
Yeah debating if Undead is best or not for Mage is poitless, people already knew that in 2005. Try making a post about this without having people bring things like this up, its impossible :D
---
yeah pre-patch was the first step, the game died with the massive nerf 2.3 or 2.4
---
Ultima Online nailed it.  Player run cities and towns, nicknames for player housed areas, guild houses...  it was amazing back then.
---
From the World of Warcraft official *Dungeon Companion* guide: "Every time Onyxia is going to move, there's a 30% chance that she'll decide to advance forward, a 35% chance that she'll move left, and a 35% chance she'll move right. If she chooses to move forward, she'll use Deep Breath."
---
So yes a totally random 30%  chance she will use her deep breath ability.
---
There, there.
---
lol but it’s not. It isn’t just taking the original game and put it online.
---
Imagine programming that crap.
---
Main: Troll Shaman, started as Tauren but i race-changed in WOTLK to Troll to min-max during my most active period.
---
Alt: Tauren Druid, was my alt in legion (as a bear) and loved it. Want a tank alt but not a warrior,  so with the high leveling speed and ability to dungeon-tank and off-tank in raids i went with druid.
---
I WAS determined to play a Tauren shaman for the nostalgia. But when i decided to have a druid alt, and since my main has been a troll for most of its time, i decided to stay a Troll. But if it hadn't been for that Tauren Druid my main would have been a Tauren Shaman. Male of course!
---
I think these people are just trolling. There's absolutely no way they can be so dense.
---
You're seriously comparing video game visuals to IRL appearance? Oh boy...
---
You can solo mara for gold  with both warlock &amp; shadow priest.
---
As a priest you can also do dme 2man jump runs for gold even tho most warriors prefer shamans early on the server life for faster clears with windfury.
---
You can solo farm lashers aswell.
---
If you focus on getting gold thru the 2man jump method you would want to run herbalism + enchanting since most of the time warriors would be running mining + engi or something along those lines. Herbalism is just a cherry ontop of the cake when it comes down to those runs so you can also run something like enchanting + engi if you are doing any kind of srs pvp  + you can talk with the guy that u are doing the runs with  to share mats for grenades with  you from the final nodes.
---
If you prefer solo farming for gold then you go either the lasher raute in dme which again would be nice to have herbalism since there are nice herbs spawning inside the dungeon for some extra gold but bear in mind the gph compared to 2man jump runs is quite lower . On the bright side you dont have to have enchanting if you go for this method.
---
Last but not least is maraudon farm . I personally havent done that one but it can be pretty profitable depending on the gear/speed that you have . But im pretty sure you would need some pretty decent gear to start doing it as a priest.
---
.....................................................................................................................................................
---
From what i know warlocks get to farm maraudon pretty early on and you dont need a lot of raid gear to do so  , pretty sure you can get away with full prebis in order to get atleast decent gph . 
---
They can duo farm DME aswell  with another caster preferably  , you can clear all the lasher + satyr trash inside for herbs , runes + cloth which is pretty nice gph aswell . 
---
All in all you wont have gold problems on either of those classes once you learn how to get &amp; how to spend your gold .
---
Now when it comes to PVP 
---
If you dont mind healing for a MC weekly  you can roll a priest . Get yourself in a decent guild &amp; get yourself your staff from there so you dont have to push for R14 weapons . The r13 priest set has almost nothing in the game that will replace it ( take it with a grain of salt there might be some pieces in naxx that would be worth replacing it with , but then again  you sacrifice set bonuses)
---
As a warlock on the other hand you dont really need to push for any of the higher ranks since their raid sets &amp; items are pretty solid &amp; even better  compared to R13 set so if you dont mind doing some srs pve in order to gear yourself up thats one way to go.
---
I would say Spriest is more noob friendly   &amp;  can stomp a lot of classes but only if they are poor players aswell . Once you get yourself into an interaction with someone  equally geared &amp; someone decently skilled most of the time those matchups dont go in your favor  . You will almost always loose to a good mage,warlock,rogue,hunter,paladin,warrior,disc priest  (also take with a grain of salt since all those things are very dependant on current server proggression , items, consums, gear , skill &amp; so on ) but the match generally goes in their favor , especially in a world pvp scenario.
---
Its also a quite hard to get into decent premades as a shadow priest .Warlocks tend to get those spots rather easily if they are competant/geared enough . 
---
If this is your is first time around classic &amp; you strictly want to play a dps on a good level in both pve &amp; pvp i would suggest staying away from hybrids since they require too much of an investment.
---
He said it was a system added in wotlk and in wotlk you could trade all bind on pickup loot for 2h.
---
Discuss with friends if we are going horde or alliance first. Alliance check.
---
Think about what professions are actually fun and are worthwhile endgame. Enchanting/engineering/blacksmith/tailoring
---
Do I want to heal/dps/tank and discuss with friends. Heal is my favourite so heal check.
---
Which profs from above work with healers, enchanting / tailoring / engineering. First 2 win.
---
Which healing class works with profs, Druid is out, priest is in, pally is possibly In.
---
Which races can be priest/ pally. Gnomes are out, night elf’s are out (wouldn’t roll a NE priest.) dwarfs are better overall and look better (IMO) then warriors so race is dwarf.
---
Which class looks better in all tier gear/pvp gear overall. Pally tier 0, priest tier 1, tier 2 is a tie, priest tier 3, pvp gear is a tie. Priest slightly winning.
---
Which class has the most pvp variety if most of my time is spent raiding. Pally is better pure holy, but for ret/shockadin/reckbomb I have to farm gear after my holy gear and take it from other guildies, counter productive and a looooong time. Priest can go holy or shadow with relatively the same gear, only need a few swaps but not entire new sets.
---
Dwarf priest wins in tier set appearance and pvp variety, dwarf priest it is.  :)
---
sure but they cant know that  
---
Thanks ! 
---
I wonder, in the current client if I disable display of helm and cape, don't other players see it either?
---

---
Honestly, if you really NEED to play hop on a private server.
---
But if I were you, I'd just wait and have the entire experience fresh. Nothing better than that first run through. Def do some research into classes specs etc
---
He didnt ask about that. But yes, ele go oom pretty fast. Thats the cost they pay for having spells that crit 2k while havibg 25% crit...
---
Attack speed wasnt normalized in vanilla until TBC prepatch.
---
Run speed, resistances,physical damage was all done in the vanilla life cycle. Effectively makes all 1.0 attack speed pets the best dps pets in game
---
The new models look good on still photos, but my god their running animations are so terrible that I can’t stomach using them.
---
I *know* this is controversial among the users here, and I know I'll get downvoted on this, but I prefer transparency over simple removal with no explanation.
---
This post is being removed due to Rule #4 (do not share or encourage the use of private servers). I recognize that the OP isn't specifically encouraging the use of private servers, but unsurprisingly, many of the replies include the advice/encouragement to do so. 
---
So, sincerely, I apologize to u/Ecchii for the inconvenience, but I encourage you to try r/wowservers for private server discussion/opinions.
---
bigger hitbox is what kills tauren casters, be it ele/resto shaman or resto druid.
---
It was just "talk to this dude"
---
Dude: "alright here's the totem"
---
That's not the point, for them...  
---
Their point of view, is that **everyone** has to have the old models, because **they** want it so.  
---
They more you think about it, the weirder it gets.  
---
It's, basically, "you can't have fun your way, you **must** have fun my way!"
---
Its 10% of the respective spell rank base healing. Approx. +208 healing for Greater Heal (Rank5)
---
None of what you actually said argues against what I said which you seemed to refute : **Only PvE endgame rusher will be slightly concerned.**
---
Which of course is not a reason to say it shouldn't be changed, but as I said, arguably is far from a priority from Blizzard point of view. And what I've been criticizing the most in the subject, is when people say :
---
&gt;Classic will be ruined if content release is not done X or Y way.
---
Which is a **overexaggeration** I can't even put in words. My point is stop saying that. Argue for better content release if it's possible yes. But remember the impact is minimal (even despite what you said which again is only relevant for hardcore endgame rushers, which are not the main population of players), and therefore don't be surprised if Blizzard doesn't go further with that subject.

You're not really living the vanilla WoW experience if you're not playing on a PvP server in my opinion. Interacting with your own faction is what makes vanilla such a great MMO, but interacting with the opposite faction is just as important.
---
Players are unpredictable, sometimes you'll kill each other, sometimes help each other but kill each other the next minute, sometimes you'll get ganked by a higher level out of nowhere, sometimes you'll be called for help by a guildmate and travel for 15 minutes just to assist him... Overall it keeps the journey fresh and the world alive all throughout the game's life and it's very, very important considering vanilla/Classic's content is "finite" and a bit outdated when it comes to PvE.
---
As a new player you may have a bit of a hard time as you enter the first contested areas where PvP is plenty around lvl 20 and have a few frustrating moments, especially against veteran players sharpening their skill on private servers for many years but that's also part of the journey and you'll get the hang of it eventually. 
---
God I pray we’ll be able to moonwalk in Classic 🙏🏽 
---
You described the problem to me without me even having to say but i'll clarify it further haha.
---
If you make something that is entirely linear, then what happens is you join people only if they are part of your chain. If someone only has one part of your chain, but your ahead on the other part you'll not really want to stay around and talk. If the game is balanced around quests and grinding you are more likely to benefit from just helping someone grind, or may want to grind for exp rather then focus on questing for a time.
---
This leads to a more social game. If you play BC, being social in outlands and the draenei/belf zones pretty much arn't there asides for "designated group kills".
---
The idea of making a world with grind drops, grind spellbook drops, a world of elites, possibly grindable materials. Open world bosses, open world even instance type dungeons. You will be opening it to a more social experience. But you definitely want to find a good balance.
---
As a mod, I really regretted having no good reason to not approve a post that started with "What makes for the best poop sock?"
---
I will roll my Human Warrior, Kethrorr. He will be leveled as Protection, just like I did back when I started.  
---
Then I will roll my Human Mage, Arthesya. She will be an Arcane Mage, or maybe a Frost one, I didn't really spend talent points on her until WotLK hit.  
---
Third one will be my Orc Hunter, Orkomondo, absolutely always only Beast Mastery.  
---
It's just my main characters since... Ever...
---
While I'm not opposed to new vanilla content I'd advise against it and just keep releasing the following expansions as they are.
---
This is because you have to imagine that people will keep coming to the server and hitting 60 after a while.
---
The issue would become instantly noticeable because you'd be there in full T3 or T4 even and I'd be here in blues. PvP (big part of vanilla) would be horrendous and jumping from guild to guild would require serious skill; after all you would have to show off people with a ton more gear than you, and while that is perfectly doable, it infact, requires alot of skill. 
---
With all that said, yeah there where alot of ideas scrapped for whatever reason that I would like to see, OP's list is pretty cool.
---
Says the guy who compares the way a character looks to getting dressed in the morning...
---
Then why do you guys keep on asking the dev who created retail, who obviously don't want to those things you have said, to add content to the game with a completely different design Philosophie. 
---
BLOWS MY MIND. 
---
It's like you are demanding they put an lfr tool in vanilla. Because you have no willpower whatsoever.
---
I mean he might. I certainly wouldn’t cause I really don’t care.
---
My first 60 back in the days was a Druid. I had dreams to be a bear tank in end-game content, big mistake, the class balance at the time didn't let me and I ended up being relegated as a subpar healer. Very frustrating experience that I will not repeat this time around.
---
Come Classic I'll play a Warrior because I won't miss another chance at tanking in raids. The leveling experience as a Warrior is horrendous, slow as hell, hamstring kiting is exhausting, bottom of the food chain when it comes to wPvP, lots of bullying from weeb night elf hunters speed leveling... But it does not matter, I have my eyes set on end-game only and I don't want to be that hybrid class that sucks at everything again.
---
Regarding races, aesthetically I much more prefer forsakens but for the same reason I'll play warrior this time, I won't miss on the OP Orc's racials on Classic and be the very generic, very unbalanced orc warrior. :^)
---
Then again, every time I get ganked and kited to death by a chad night elf hunter these days I want to roll a Rogue, because I'm much better at it and it will make the journey and overall wPvP a lot easier.
---
Resto Shaman, I'm going into the Enh tree as well for the benefits whilst leveling, I'm going to be leveling with a friend who is playing Arms/Prot Warrior, we've both played on and off since vanilla, but neither of us achieved a lot in vanilla, so that's our goal.
---
You don't have any desire whatsoever to try something new?
---
Blizzard already talked about mondern monitors in Classic.
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1811
---
I'm actually not doing this, I played a Rogue from Vanilla to Cata and stopped playing it as I hated the changes they made to it for Cata. I definitely will play a rogue as an alt but I'm going Shaman as my main as I feel like healing in Vanilla as I never did it back then.
---
What is this classic moonwalk? I was not aware this was a thing.
---
I play warlock and hunters always rape me.... I must be doing something wrong 
---
Dwarf is also best choice for pvp when it comes to disc/holy. Stoneform op
---
I recommend just getting the Extended Quest Log add-on. It doesn't aid you in any way in regards to the quest, but instead makes the task of reading the quest text and selecting other quests in the log much tidier.
---
Orc is by far the best choice for Warlocks due to 25% stun resist racial.
---
Don't want to join you anyway dick
---
Well, that wasn't a feature in the recent beta so its hard to say if it will be in realease. Regardless of that you really aren't going to be doing much kiting as a shaman once the get in you they are pretty well going to stay there unless you hit them with a grenade or other eng item ( or warstomp)
---
So, you create a problem in your mind and then complain about it. Are you Donald Trump ?
---
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns, got it!
---
Wow, such fresh and original topic.
---
#nochanges is no changes to the game. Is your monitor a part of the game? No it is not. Same with your hardware.
---
Try to learn something about the subject next tim before shit posting.
---
What the fuck is Ion
---
I don't know, the boost of imp renew and spiritual healing might be worth it as a fresh 60 before you get any real +healing gear.
---
This PvP issue thing is funny as this would be such a major change to "how it worked back then" :D But #noChanges, right? :joy:
---
Human rogue if my coworker is still down to play with me when it releases, undead rogue if I’m solo.
---
Tbh, i dont really care if ZG is with BWL. BWL is still stupidly easy content, regardless if you have ZG items or not. People seem to think that release of instance = full access to all of the gear. You might see first useful ZG item after few weeks. Enchants will take a LONG time even if you do trash grind before killing any mobs.
---
Literally those wont change anything regarding BWL. And PVP'ers that go for high rank... well, you know what you are getting into, cant change the game to make it easier for you.
---
I chose grand Nordic names, then came back through and named them after food. Release me from this eternal torment.
---

---
So you think a 1440/4K monitor in 2019 isnt a stronger change in graphics than some minor lightning effect in "insert random zone" Our new computers is basically changing the whole friggin game graphicwise. I know its a shitpost. But I did lure you out of your moms basement :D
---
&gt;**It's not because you will have access to ZG at the same time as BWL that suddenly, you will get full ZG gear in 1 week and BWL will be "trivialized"** 
---
Indeed and BWL gear is mostly superior to ZG gear anyways. There are few upgrades for healers or lets say OPTIONS because your BIS loot wont drop... ever.
---
And some of them aren't... so:
---
&gt; Can't wait to have dungeons we have to explore again!
---
I played a NE Hunter at vanilla launch and hated life at 60.  Rolled a human Rogue on a new server launch a few months later and raided with him throughout MC/BWL/AQ. Quit WoW until WoTLK
---
in WoTLK, Played UD priest with PuG Naxx, but mainly pvp/arena. Quit the game until now.
---
For classic, I was dead set on another rogue, probably orc/undead. 
---
But the other day, I looked into shaman and realized it's the class for me.  I get to heal in raids which is my favorite pve roll and I get to have a blast pvping.
---
But Orc or Tauren?
---
Dorf &gt; human
---
I'm sensing a bit of hostility. Horde got shadowfang keep at that range, and I wouldn't say bfd is an alliance dungeon either, while the stockade is a half-dungeon. But yes counting the dungeons in alliance territory: The deadmines, stockades, gnomer (which can be accessed with a teleport). Horde territory; RFC, WC, SFK, RFD, RFK, SM.
---
Same here.  I played rogue throughout vanilla (and a little hunter).  I never got to experience the healing life in vanilla.
---
In wotlk I played priest which was great to heal in raids, but with pvp, I hated playing as a healer.  So I'm going shaman this time around to try and get the best of both worlds and try something new.
---
I think I may roll a Druid honestly. I was a hunter in vanilla and started fresh on a paladin for BC, but have been playing a Druid on live for the past two years and love it. I kind of want to see what Bear tanking was like in the old days.
---
Knowing every buff out there, min/maxing everything is what already makes BWL easy. Few more might just prevent death here and there. Making \_absolutely\_ no difference in "progression" for experienced players.
---
I know how i would run the content, first go knock out full MC+BWL run. After that grind trash mobs in ZG for reputation until LAST day of reset and then kill all ZG bosses (saving all bijous+coins for later use).
---
No point going ZG first for buffs, you want to maximize your reputation gains.
---
That's a lot of paranoia, for several reasons:
---
&gt; Small groups of friends can join the same pug. They just have to unequip the loot they want to roll on so that everyone in their group can roll and trade after the raid even if the pug is master looting and inspecting players before the raid. No one will know a thing...
---
Sure, groups of friends have nothing better to do than joining PuG raids they actually don't need to do, unequipping their better gear just to get a piece of gear for one of them (which also means they always have to keep an extra piece of gear for their sharade)... you're seriously telling me people going that much out of their way just to screw over others will be the norm. Nope, that's some apocalyptic conspiracy theory. 
---
&gt; You can also join pugs solo. Unequip items that can drop and then sell it to someone with an exuse that you dont really need it... Should be worth a couple of hundred gold. Same in all raids and even dungeons (the hat and cloak from Strat UD and all dungeons sets comes to mind). No one can know unless they inspect every players loot history somehow and even then you can claim you vendored it by mistake and thats why you needed one more...
---
Also wrong. If you rolled need, everyone sees it and will know you rolled need. If you're trying to sell someone that piece of gear bc you "don't really need it" everyone will know what's going on. If you didn't really need it and it rolling on it was in fact just a mistake you wouldn't be selling the item, you'd be giving it away for free, since you wouldn't have rolled need on it anyway. 
---
If loot trading were to have the effect you're claiming ("removing PUG raids") things you describe in your scenarios would need to happen all the time. But they'll be a miniscule exception. Just like ninjaing back in the day. 
---
You're basing all your arguments on the assumption that the vast majority of Classic players will be anti-social, egoistic assholes that care neither for the community nor for their reputation within it. That's quite the paranoid PoV, especially since the Classic community is in general known to be helpful and social. 
---
\#fearward
---
You will grind ZG for like a month before you can get the enchant. Jeesus. Reputation rewards are on most classes absolutely garbage compared to gear from DM, strat etc.
---
Troll Priest.
---
Professions: Herbalism &amp; Alchemy or Tailor &amp; Enchant
---
what is there to explore when you have between 1 and 3 clear paths you must take most of the time?  
---
very clear fixed paths, its not open world  
---
it will be warrior and priest, with a feral on the side for sure. Dwarf female warrior and a human male priest. I might go Horde for my druid but that's undecided.
---
I didn't enjoy my hunter at 60 that much, but the quest line for the bow/staff from MC was a BLAST.  
---
At first I was skeptical because I had to go through this long quest instead of just getting a drop, but it was a ton of fun. 
---
Then I rolled rogue and loved every aspect of that class and raided with that.
---
Yep, and with the shirt that says “tell ur mom to stop calling”. Just like in the good old days.
---
Is that really what most people will do? For me it seems natural to think the complete opposite way. The last thing I'd want to do is experience Vanilla as a Warlock again. Not because I didn't have a blast, but this is the chance to do it from a slightly different perspective. Experience new things. Not just go back and repeat something in the exact same way.
---
Hope you don't ninja AFK on Chromaggus and kill everyone!
---
&gt;Pantheon
---
Feel free to join our discord channel to chat with the current team members :)
---
Surely in PvP orc must be the by far best choice for any class that has the option of choosing orc!
---
No worries, and yeah im gonna wait.
---
Male Troll Shaman, because this was my first toon back in the days. I never raided with him but i think heal was the only viable raid spec for shamans and iirc trolls were the best heal shamans due to their racial haste cd. And since i got into healing recently i think im gonna give vanilla heal shamans a try. 
---
My second char will be a Undead Rogue for sure, because this was my first main character which i played until wod.
---
I think nostalgia and my need to try something different in raids determined my decision for the most part.
---
&gt; Levelling from 1-60 can in itself be a cool adventure if each expansion introduced a random zone ranging from 10-55 along with lategame elite content. 
---
Aah right, another Age of Conan, then. Well, that could make sense.
---
&gt; And this also includes the fact that BC destroys levelling from 5-58 because they introduce spell damage/attack power and perfect rolled stat quest items to everything that are superior to all drops.
---
Not just that. Vanilla leveling is just not in line with TBC. In vanilla, you level up, gear up, etc. And it's an adventure. You progress. Than, you get to Outland, and realize that all your progress becomes irrelevant, and all that matters now is the hard point of level 58.
---
Imagine this. You spend 10 years sewing, then industrial revolution comes and it's now machines that sew. You have a lot of experience that nobody cares about. You again have zero qualifications, and again have to find your first job. Welcome to Outland.
---
Even worse, if you were previously leveling in vanilla, and did some raiding. 
---
You spent 10 years of your life, sewing. And then, the invention arrives. You are left without a job, but with 10 years of past experience. Now, your 10-years-younger friend, who still lives with his mom, gets a job, and you still have to live on the edge. TBC is now live!
---
The thing is, even without quest helper, and without all the knowledge of where to go all the time, you still don't really have to read the entire quest text. It usually says in like the last sentence (or first sentence of the last paragraph - don't remember exactly) where you're supposed to go. So there's really no need to read any more than that, and again you lose any immersion you'd usually get from reading the quest text.
---
I have played Warcraft 3 but not any recent mmorpg -kind of fell out of gaming after college. 
---
You don't use a poop sock?
---
Every day it becomes more and more apparent that the mods really aren't hardcore fans enough to be qualified to have authority over this sub.
---
Some add ones really help out. Like the auction house ones or the inventory ones. I wouldn’t rule them out. 
---
NO CHANGES = Global channel (was added in 1.11)
---
I'm so confused. Why do we keep calling WoW players weebs now?
---
I narrowed my choice of class down to shaman. I played as a Rogue most of vanilla on alliance and I want to try out something new.
---
I plan on doing some pve and pvp. I’ll probably spec resto until mc/BWL are farm then go the 30/0/21 build. 
---
After BWL I may focus more on pvp, since AQ was never very fun for me (could be that as a Rogue I didn’t have any fun roles imo).
---
Question is, Tauren or Orc? 
---
Tauren: the war stomp is a great interrupt and the health bonus will probably save me a lot.
---
Orc: stun resist. As an ally rogue, I would always choose a different race to attack if available because of that damn 25% stun resist (feel more like 90%).  Having that passive is awesome, but I’m unsure which to play.
---
Troll: No. 
---
Hands down no one I've played with is more passionately vociferous in their opposition to queue dodging than Ohhgee. 
---
Should be an interesting listen.
---
GNOME MAGE
---
WAKE
---
THE
---
FUCK
---
UP
---
While they usually do betas they're almost finished products and this might not need it.  Blizzard always impressed me with how people stick to their NDAs in the friends and family alphas they do... they get most of their testing done in there.
---
Wait, what I’m missing. It says horde wins but alliance has three caps. I’ve played since vanilla on and off so I not fully understand dodging I thought that was more done at the beginning is it something to do with the end?
---
Play private Server to Test Out classes and decide
---
Mace rogues was only really prevalent in the BC expansion. Combat rogue is o.k in PVP, but there are much better options.
---
Bummer :( 
---
That's really not that different.
---
Warrior. I have to tank or else I won’t have fun, so it has to be warrior. 
---
Tauren warrior because while levelling in classic, I found people don’t often wait for the tank to get aggro. I’m gonna need war stomp. 
---
Yes. Honestly the headaches it causes sometimes is 100% worth all the potential fun you will end up having. Plus that added edge of danger adds something special to the game that PVE servers just cant bring to the table
---
sending message to save for later. will be dwarf priest, cleared through AQ40 and a few wings of Naxx on private servers as priest. know the class pretty well and always willing to help thanks! 
---
Someone got ganked in redridge a few too many times?
---
&gt; shadowfang keep
---
it is lower, more like Deadmines.
---
&gt; wouldn't say bfd is an alliance dungeon 
---
well, more like neutral, but closer to Alliance towns.
---
Are there any horde graveyards in Duskwood?
---
I'll hide first then ;) i have raided for a long time now and havent had the need to afk on a boss yet so should be fine :D just taking all precautions
---
If you dont agree then your definition of Vanilla is wrong.
---
You and me have different opinions on the definition on what Vanilla is.
---
My opinion is right and your opinion is wrong.
---
What item is that? I have never seen flip flops work socks in game before. That is truly epic!
---
This is why I married you. 😘

&gt; counting the dungeons in alliance territory: The deadmines, stockades, gnomer (which can be accessed with a teleport). Horde territory; RFC, WC, SFK, RFD, RFK, SM
---
well, in short, Barrens should be made neutral.
---
Yes, they left only a single floor.
---
Only available for Diablo immortal preorder
---
I wanted to do either mage (my first main), warlock, hunter or shaman.
---
I asked my friends, who I know I'll be playing with the majority of the time when not solo, what faction they wanted to play. Horde, they said.
---
Shaman is the newest choice for me, and will fit my perceived play style best - PvP, dungeons, no time for raids. That's where shaman shines the most, and since it's the newest choice to me as I never played shaman in vanilla I decides for sure that's what I'm going to do. Not sure about race yet, probably gonna be troll though.
---
If you’re doing PvP probably the stun resist will be huge, especially since as a healer a rogue will definitely try and stunlock you down
---
probably an unpopular opinion but the art is one of the things that current wow is still doing really well and I'd love to play classic wow with the newer character models, character animation and decent texture resolution
---
I bet you someone noticed. You noticed. How dare you ruin their immersion with your selfishness.
---
I love your stupidly ridiculous that is.
---
Human warrior, I like how gear sits on them and their attack animations. I played pservers for 2 years and that helped me narrow my choices to warrior,  and I like the rp value of a warrior as well
---
&gt;Ha, I came here to ask the Exact same question but basing it more on looks. Tauren is huge and awesome but those hooves really get me and the helm looks a bit sketchy. Orc strong and buff and who doesnt wanna look like Unbreakable! With shoes aswell!!!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;that 30/0/21 build you talk about though, is it a PvP build for ele and a little bit of healing on the side or can you heal in raids with it, whats the deal?   
---
&gt;Shaman is the play but will it be the great big cow or the slow green guy haha
---
But I have it on good authority she DEFINITELY deep breaths more this patch.
---
Sounds cool and good. 
---
My question is less “should I play this class” but more “what class would best suit my lifestyle”? I’m a medical student so I will only realistically get to play 1-2 hours per week; meaning I’d like to be able to log in and quickly do a dungeon or grind out gold/mats for a bit. I probably won’t be able to commit to a raiding schedule so endgame for me will be mostly dungeons and PvP. I’m thinking Paladin because I can get groups quickly as Holy, and as Ret I can (slowly) grind out mats or gold; but I was also thinking about Priest for similar reasons. Any input much appreciated!
---
Don't listen to this guy, i'd be incredibly surprised if blizzard didn't beta test classic. It's still a huge game, capable of having a lot wrong with it. The bad PR that would come with not beta testing and then having issues on launch is beyond the pale.
---
Speaking of PR, the massive boost classic is going to get when streamers play the beta is going to be huge. 
---
bay ta
---
This. If I didn't get bored of my Warlock from 2004 to the end of Legion, I'm not going to abandon him now.
---
Horde names are highlighted in red, its horde that has 3 caps.
---
Orc Enhancement Shaman. The downfalls of the spec are numerous. I'll get kited. I'll have times where lesser geared players will beat me because Windfury doesn't proc. But no other spec in the game makes me yell "OH!" like 2h enhancement does. When you see those three big numbers pop up on a clothie...it's just. so. good. 
---
Nothing else like it in the game. I'm not here to showcase skill, I'm rolling the dice. Sometimes they'll fall in my favor, other times they won't. 
---
Exactly this. I simply won't need it I already know where I'll go what I'll do and when I'll do it.
---
Removed rule 1
---
Just level up your first character on the pvp server with your hubby for the experience. If you guys roll characters right when the game releases you don't have to worry about getting ganked by 60s for a little whilr since most others will be leveling too. This gives you guys a much better fighting chance and honestly the pvp server experience is so much more valuable and memorable than pve servers.
---
&gt; Quel'Thalas - a questing hub, possibly a high-level catchup zone (but not giving away previous tier, like timeless or argus), with Sunwell Plateau raid
---
Redo QT entirely.  Ghostlands is a lame zone.  Don't forget about Zul'Aman either.
---
&gt; Karazhan + the crypt (kara25 + kara40?)
---
20+40, but yes.  With an attunement.
---
&gt; Old Outland (but that would be another continent, which is too far away from vanilla's philosophies)
---
Create some unique AV-styled BGs from some of the cooler zones (Blade's Edge, Terrokar, maybe HFP) with a shared rep/reward system and possibly random map selection (e.g., you queue for "Outlands" and it's random which zone you get).
---
&gt; Emerald Dream - could be related to the nightmare dragon portals
---
The faction who kills an Emerald Dragon gets access to that dragon's portal for the week.  Each is a short 10 man dungeons which reward consumables, enchanting materials, fish, etc.
---
&gt; Uldsomething, the one in Tanaris - would make the most sense, as there was even unfinished questline
---
Heroic level dungeon for highly geared players.  Reward is gold commensurate with your dungeon "score" (e.g., time completed, # of wipes, etc).
---
&gt; Twilight Highlands, with possible Grim Batol raid. There was some unused raid portal, if I remember
---
Don't need the zone, just need Grim Batol.  Dragons vs. dwarves.  Each player picks a faction to start repping with.  Horde and alliance fight together with their picked faction to control different hubs.  Controlling a hub gives access to vendors who sell commodities at cheaper prices and daily quests that reward consumable &amp; tradeskill materials.  Your rep with a faction decays if you don't contribute regularly.
---
&gt; Winterspring raid - again unused portal
---
Warlock only challenge mode dungeon.  Reward is green fire.
---
&gt; That mage portal in Stormwind mage tower - ideal place for player housing? But not garrison, please.
---
Mage only challenge mode dungeon.  Reward is ... something cool for mages.
---
&gt; Hyjal
---
A vanilla Lake Wintergrasp.
---
&gt; Gilneas
---
Level 40-60 questing level area supplement.
---
&gt; Player housing (was promised)
---
I'd like a simple BoTW kind of house where I can display some gear and have a bed or something.  Maybe if you log out in your player house, instead of getting a rested XP bonus you get a rested gold bonus or something else that would be useful to a level 60.
---
&gt; War of the Ancients raid (was promised), along with entire Caverns of Time
---
Most of CoT dungeons are lame and the infinite dragonflight is dumb, IMO.  I'd settle for CoT working like timewalking, where each week there's a different 5 man (from all across different xpacs) tuned down for vanilla with a badge reward system.
---
&gt; Deadwind Pass - on vanilla, it was another zone like pre-AQ Silithus. Could hold some pre-kara quests.
---
Agree, used to flesh out Karazhan lore.
---
&gt; East of Burning Steppes - even the Burning Steppes map looks like as if there was a path between the mountain, but got removed
---
I'd settle for a Redridge Canyon zone that just asks as a pass with a safe road between RR and Badlands with a few 30-40 neutral quests to supplement STV.  Redridge ganking evey by lowbs is a big problem, so having another hub with slightly higher level players closeby would help.
---
&gt; Deathwing Scar - Deepholm raid? Wait, isn't it what was supposed to be, instead of Onyxia? Lord Daval Prestor II, anyone?
---
Deepholm was a cool zone but it would need to be redone story-wise.  I wouldn't mind the zone acting as a level 60 questing area with a long story involving multiple elite 5 man quests, maybe a 20 man outdoor (like Blightcaller) etc. to get attuned to fight Deathwing.  That'd be neat.
---
&gt; Azshara - almost nothing there
---
It could use a few extra more quests, but I like the empty feeling of it.  Makes the world feel bigger.
---
Screenshotted, proof sent to Blizzard. I backtraced your IP address and included it.
---
I was thinking of doing this too, but I worry from time to time that I won't be able to find groups all that well. Aren't rogues not really sought after that much? Toss up for me between druid, rogue, and shaman. 
---
the knowledge that the game is going to stay the same for years to come.
---
that's why i know i'll have **ATLEAST** a warrior, priest, rogue, and a mage. 
---
It's just a problem of who to level first, but benediction would be cool as hell to have.... 
---
Indeed, it sucks if you have to level 48-60 in those few weeks, but I would argue it's up to the players to get together and help their faction and protect their allies who are trying to level. If you don't like that then you always have the option to go on a PVE server. 
---
Also not everyone is a tryhard min maxing everything including honor gains, and it seems like a lot of players put world PVP among best things the game has to offer. For me it's the reason I prefer vanilla over BC (boo flying mounts).
---
Hey Josh, just wanted to say I really appreciate these podcasts. I commute quite a bit for my relationship/work, and I ALWAYS throw on a countdown to classic podcast.
---
Cant wait to listen to this one. Seriously these podcasts have added some well needed wow discussion into my life
---
Let me preface this by saying I've been dabbling in some private servers recently, trying to reacquaint myself with vanilla classes. As such I need sone questions answered.
---
 I have been trying to decide what to play but I am kinda particilar in picking class, I tend to be a fairly hardcore player and will be attempting to clear aq and naxx to get nearly bis pvp gear before retiring from raiding to focus on pvp. (Mostly wsg/ab because I enjoy those the most)
---
Here are some things I noticed or think that I did, but I can't remember if it was like that in vanilla. 
---
Before playing the private server I was pretty deadset on orc warlock, but during my short stint on this instant 60 server (although I'm not nearly as geared as most players so that probably skews my perception).first  I have noticed that my felhunter dies, very quickly only having around 3k health, his spell lock also seems to get resisted much more than I remember. So correct me if I'm wrong but in vanilla there was no pet scaling, and they didn't have enough spell hit to land 100% of their spells and there really wasn't anything you can do about it. 
---
With that being the case I have been playing rogue which I have been enjoying but I have also heard that they fall off very hard late game for PvP. I never played rogue in vanilla so I don't know how accurate that is.
---
Tried spriest and they were as mana hungry as everone says, drinking constantly ( other than pots/dark runes I don't guess anything you can do about it.
---
Frost mage was pretty fun and a real contender, but I still seemed like I was drinking alot, getting a warrior on you with a dispel bot sucked but, I guess that's every class.
---
Anyway thus is a rambling incoherent mess of thoughts, hope y'all can decipher it and give me some advice, I want something not reliant on others to do well, that is a near the top end for near bis geared small scale/solo pvp, that preferably doesn't have to drink after every pvp encounter. Any advice or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
---
BG's and Honor system simply disgust me. Rewarding PvP ruins it. People talk about Honor/Hour and are literally farming. PvP should NEVER be about farming. Farming entails that you are in control and are owning the enemy. It works against an NPC, but in PvP the thing getting owned is a player. No game should have any gameplay mechanic that forces the farming of players because of it. Yet that is what this system breeds.
---
Which why I am looking forward to the first couple of months where there is no BG, just wPvP.
---
I'm so impatient to just quest the same way I did back in 2005. Stopped in WotLK, never played in pservers, never used any quest addon. With distance now I guess it sounds quite naive to do quest by reading the whole quest and not having many hints such as in other games. But I'm gonna enjoy it anyway. And doesn't matter how long it will take to level 60. I'm not an altoholic so I better enjoy the leveling phase of my main.
---
ya. That goes back to the last thing i said (also im going to sleep) but expansions should expand on a game, not replace. The flaw in raising level caps is if your not re-balancing all former content then your simply replaceing.
---
When you raise the level requirement you should be asking yourself "Was levelling from 1-60 really a issue" If the answer is no. (the answer is no btw) Then you should be figuring out something else that fits in that 1-60 range.
---
Troll spotted bois
---
Its 2006. Dwarf Hunter. Never really raided, but did as many 5 / 10 man dungeons and world groups (I killed Blightcaller to get that bow).  PUGed MC many times. Spent weeks of my life in Alterac Valley. 
---
Set myself a goal of taming Broken Tooth. Found his spawn area thanks to THotbot, and logged out. Logged back on morning, noon, and night for many days. Maybe took 2 weeks before I finally found him.
---
Clear the area. Frozen trap set. downgrade my weapons to not unduly damage him. Commence taming him. breaks my trap. have to run, try again. 50% taming complete.
---
Then a troll warrior comes over the hill on his raptor mount. its PvE so i'm not overly concerned...until i realize what he's doing. This guy knows why I'm there, and he attacks and kills Broken tooth.
---
I raged that day harder than I've ever raged at a video game before. I lamented greatly being on a PvE server -- no revenge possible. This douchnozzle proceeds to point, and laugh, and follow me to point and laugh for the next 10 minutes. 
---
You couldn't create an alternate faction character at this time as i recall... i couldn't even alt flip to tell him off. 
---
I hated this troll with the fury of a thousand suns. 15 years later my blood boils at this guy. Screw you Xerwaz and the raptor you rode in on (who is probably your mother). 
---
...
---
and this is why classic WoW is the best WoW. 
---
Boomkin, none, all you have is 1 root effect that breaks quite easily, you have no anti pushback and your only instant cast offensive spell is quite weak. In one of my guilds it was known as punching bag spec, because you just stand there and get hit with your 360% armor but cant do anything.
---
Enh shaman, weak. The problem with enh shaman has always been that theres 0 itemization for this spec. While every other spec and class can find decent gear in 60 blues, enh shaman dont even get that. They have to settle for pretty crap gear and thus, end up pretty weak in PvP.
---
Combat rogue and fury warrior, pretty good. Obvuously not as good as CB/prep or Arms, but they can certainly get the job done.
---
Arcane mage, very good option. 3 minute mage is a meme but very useful in PvP.
---
Demo lock, best lock pvp spec.
---
Ret paladin, good spec. Paladins are highly flexible in PvP, depends if you mean ret paladin "doesnt ever heal" or just ret paladin that knows how to play.
---
Mace stun shares same diminishing return as kidney shot and cheap shot, it's basically useless 
---
I mean with that little time I think.I would go Hunter, 2 hours a week your going to be leveling to 60 for 6 months minimum maybe longer, most players average 10 to 12 days /played time to get to 60 so you are looking at quite the trek to 60.  Pally is one of the slowest levelers in the game so it's gonna be even worse
---
Awaiting my downvote execution but I will be playing with updated graphics if they are available.  It's the classic mechanics I want.
---
RIP 
---
Healer, orc for sure, a case can be made for Ele tauren but you can't really go wrong with orc in pvp
---
Hell yeah, I’m with you on that on.  “It’s only nostalgia” if people want the old graphics.  No so much if you just want the gameplay. Aaaaaaand go!
---
I had thought about posting that issue here on this sub but I expected to just be bombarded with "#noChanges" and downvotes... Sounds about right
---
&gt;  The main reason is that there's no expected further development of the game
---
There is also no cash shop. I think the normal subscription prize is fine*
---
^*) as long as there is no loot trading
---
That's true about finding the information needed for the quest.
---
I find that modern quests UI's (and Questie) can lead one to only stare at the UI and not the world around them. This is especially true for certain games like Skyrim and retail WoW. It's so easy to not even look at the zone/area you're in when you can just stare at an arrow or highlighted portion of your map.
---
Just reading the quest and trying to figure out where objectives are really makes you more familiar with the environment and appreciate it a bit more. In my opinion,  anyway.
---
If that's the case I hope they'll do classic tbc in a couple years 
---
You live under a rock? New graphics is only for the world, not for the character models.
---
Blizzard pay sucks and people are quitting over it, they got honeydicked into a "great video game company that they've grown up enjoying" so they'll accept a lower pay. 
---
It's comfortable under here.
---
Hahahah durid, such nostalgia.
---
Dummies are still used today. They're a quick and dirty way to get certain timings correct. Though I don't think those dummies had anything to do with Deep Breath. 
---
One fun example I heard at a BlizzCon was from Strand of the Ancients. The BG would start with 2 ships holding 2-halves of the attacking team reaching 2 different docks at the same time. To get that timing right they apparently put 2 invisible gnome mages at the front of the ships, who were constantly trying to cast a long range pyroblast at each other. Once they got the timing so those pyroblasts hit simultaneously, it gave them the perfect timing for the ships to arrive simultaneously as well. 
---
I’m just copying what the OP said cause i found it funny 
---
For some reason, on the Chromag fight, if we kited him down into the earlier room, my graphics card would blue screen my computer and I wiped my guild at like 8% on our first attempt.  
---
I updated my driver's all the time, called GeForce Customer support, no clue why it happened to me there.  Happened to another guy on a different server with the same graphics card as well.
---
So because of my weird computer, we had to fight him in the entry way to Nefarian instead (which I thought was easier anyway). It's awesome to have a guild who cares lol. 
---
Much of the database work is done by now from my understanding of the blizcon demo. I'm sure there will be odd items, quests, spawns that need addressing but much of that will be discovered by players on live. Even with a beta, bugs happen in production. 
---
I can see blizzard doing a distributed beta test. Meaning, first you start from level 1. This tests sharding, server stress and the first two zones for each faction. Capped at level 10. After that I can see them offering an option to select your level in a pve only situation with a maximum level of somewhere between 1-59. This would allow people to select a zone to level/test with a good sample of classes. Theoretically this would maximize the number of bug reports. With that said its actually most likely that they do not do any of this and only offer a stress test to gauge popularity.
---
I've been debating between a few choices,but I'm going to play an undead warlock. That's what I played back then and I loved it. I wanted to try mage too, but I'll feel so at home with my old main. 
---
Playing hunter. I had the best time with my hunter when i played (quit after tbc). I've played most other classes end game. Love the hunter, specially for pvp.
---
Naic.
---
Stfu
---
Wow I’m an idiot sorry it was early and lack of sleep. Haven’t played warsong gulch in too long also . I was looking at blue flags thinking it was an alliance cap haha. 
---
Its removed.
---
Gnome Mage because I’m trying to give my first character the play through he actually deserved.
---
I started in 1.10, at 12ish years old, and had no fucking clue what I was doing. I came from Runescape, where grinding was the name of the game, so I did maybe 100 quests on my path to level 43. That character was abandoned in early TBC when me and a friend rolled on a server with my cousin and that character ended up being my main until WoD.
---
My gnome deserves better and by god he’ll have better.
---
Having played a rogue throughout vanilla, I think you'll be fine. I had mainly Tier 2 gear, a piece or 2 of AQ gear, etc.  
---
After my guild broke up during AQ, I went all out in pvp and I had a blast. I quit right before BC came out and never felt that I had a disadvantage.  
---
As long as you have the skills, you'll be be fine. 
---
Why waste your time with medical school when you can just play video games?
---
I've been an UD rogue since vanilla as well, but now im gonna go NE Rogue! I've always loved their animations so much more.
---
That's a good point, but with the stun resist, it's mainly benefiting against rogues, pally, &amp; warrior.  Whereas the health increase and war stomp benefits against everyone.
---
No, I'm not interested in PvP but nazis in my guilds raid group (yes actual nazis) were being toxic pieces of shit and refused to PvP with anyone who didn't have engineering. The whole private server community is just rotten to the core, I almost hope Blizzard make changes so we won't have to deal with them.
---
I ask myself every day 😭😭
---
I saw a video on MonkeyNews’ channel when  sandboxing the 1.13 demo was all the rage, he couldn’t get the moonwalk to work unfortunately :(
---
I like paladin.
---
Yea I was thinking of leveling too. Does it really make that much of a difference? I leveled a paladin in Vanilla and while its slow I didn’t find it terrible; do other DPS classes legitimately level *faster*? 
---
You know in the 90 or so servers that you say there will be there’s still going to be a server cap regardless if sharding exists. If 3500 people are allowed on the server, with or without sharding, there still will on be 3500 people ever logged in at once. Not sure what you think sharding is, but to give you a brief definition, it’s blizzards way of not showing you everything around you (aka players), which helps their infrastructure run faster. (It should have no effect on your PC either way)
---
Shaman(tauren or orc). Enhance/resto getting Axe/Mace at 28 for Corpsemaker with points into resto for reduced healing cast time and totem cost. This lets me get imp GW at 20 also. I can move fast, heal better, use 2H weapons and kill efficiently. The bonus from deeper enhance scales well with gear but without extra crit % its return is minimal while leveling. At 40 I respect to Elemental and dominate world pvp with massive crits, turtle scale armor, and Coldrage. 1H + shield with FT weapon is pretty solid for leveling if the damage carries over to classic wow. Leveling this way allows me to help guild members early as I expect to out level many of them. 
---
At 60, I wanted to be able to do damage and heal in pvp. I think that Shaman have the opportunity to offer a larger return in group pvp than most any class.
---
This isn't even true. Legions sets were basically ALL Class themed. That's probably why we had some of the best sets ever created in Legion.
---
I hope there are no changes like that so people like you don't stick around.
---
What's 500 years to an elf?
---
It's controlled by the D2 chat gem
---
I cannot decide!
---
I am set on a Warrior and a Warlock. I don't know the faction yet. If I go horde, they will /probably/ be Orc and Orc, and if I go Alliance, it'll be ??? and Gnome.
---
But hold on there, what is ??? ? I dunno!
---
Human: Weapon skill and rep bonus - pretty great!
---
Dwarf: Stomeform is great for a plethora of things, and you can be Gimli 'n' stuff
---
Night Elf: I have recently learnt to really appreciate shadowmeld, which I think will be AMAZING for PvP, and especially nice like leveling, since I also often get up a lot, and shadowmelding out of danger sounds great. Dodge and nature resist is great too, and hell, improved death yay!
---
Also what for support? I don't even know if I want an herb/alch healer or hunter! I basically want to try ALL THE THINGS (how about a mage with full T2??), but I don't have time for all that, it's awful!
---
Also, for the leveling warrior, I don't know if I should go mining/BS for fantasy, or mining/eng for tools, or just BS/eng for both worlds and then load my supporting characters up with mining!
---
And to top it all off - profession specialization - Goblin or Gnome engineering, and most importantly, Armorsmith and Master axesmith?
---
I know these are a lot of questions, but I'd really appreciate help in untangling my thoughts from themselves. If more info is needed, feel free to ask!
---
It's a hybrid that can be decent for both pvp and pve.  For pve, it includes a lot of the resto traits you want (natures swiftness - instant cast a spell).
---
From raiding vanilla content back in the day, I'll probably follow my normal respec strategy.  For new content releases, I'll spec full PvE and when everyone gets better gear and the raid is on a farm status, I'll respec to my hybrid spec.
---
I did that on my rogue except I went from full PvE to Full PVP spec and I was still near the top of the dps meters being pvp spec.
---
The two classes I want is either mage or warlock I will mostly be doing raids and dungeons but which class can still solo farm somewhat easily without having to change their spec? I will be going alliance most likely on a pve server 
---
Just want to do a lot of damage 
---
Like the weirdest pettiest form of gatekeeping.
---
It's the same DPS as any other cat, and have practically the same frenzy up time as any other 1.5 attack speed pet.
---
Both of those can solo farm easily.  Mage is definitely the best farming class, but warlock is fine too. I wouldn't worry about farming for your class choice if you are a dps class.  
---
Also, after I had over 1000g's and had my mounts and had all my bank slots open, I never had to worry about gold too much.  Unless if you are going for R14, then you need a ton of gold to afford all of the weapons.
---
He doesn't mean that everyone wants the same graphics, but that everyone should be seeing the same thing in game. I'm inclined to agree since when I make a character look a certain way I want to know that everyone sees me as I intend. e.g. I'd rather not be seen as a goofy off brand dreamworks character if I make a tauren, and my jacked steampunk grandpa look for dwarves doesn't work as well with the new models. I can make a character look however I want on my own screen, and I find some of the new versions of models/animations better (gnomes especially), but I value how other people see in game far more.
---
First answer this: why are you going to be playing classic WoW?
---
Mage-
---
\-has blizzard which is incredible for grinding exp as well as simple gold. 
---
\-portal which is incredibly useful when your only other option for travel is the 60min cd on your hearth.
---
\-very good dps
---
\-can flee from world pvp
---
\-spells can cost a fortune if you plan on buying all of them, could delay 40 mount
---
Loc's-
---
\-get a "free" mount which can lead you to spend that initial gold on professions / more spells / etc...
---
\-competitive dps
---
\-has a pet for leveling, can tank harder kill quests
---
Never had a problem finding a spot in a raid as a rogue. Rogues have some incredible single target deeps in vanilla. 
---
Does this mean that you have to **impose** this on them?  
---
Why should their point of view force the way **others** enjoy the game?
---
There's a fairly large spread of leveling times for different classes. I am sure there is data out there but its a spread of days if i recall
---
Doesn't mean it wasn't there.
---
I'm a big PvP server advocate, but there are a few important questions to ask yourself before you commit to a PvP server.
---
1) Do you enjoy Open, unrestricted PvP, or structured PvP?
---
There is a difference between liking the PvP you find in the Open world versus what you'll find in a battleground where teams are roughly balanced number wise. And don't forget that you can technically flag yourself for PvP on PvE servers, and plenty of people do. Don't let a love for PvP trick you into thinking you'll enjoy PvP servers.
---
When you join a PvP server you are going to get killed unfairly *alot*. Ganked by higher level characters, jumped by parties and raids of higher numbers, and camped at flight path landing spots, instance portals, and on your own corpse. Speaking of camping:
---
2) If you have plans to get something done in-game, are you ok with the fact that those plans may get disrupted for *hours?*
---
Will you accept that the mats you needed for raid consumables might come up short because you're farming spot is overrun? Will you get upset if you're on your way to a dungeon and 30 minutes or more as added to your commute time as you corpse run (die, res at max distance from your corpse to your destination, die, repeat)?
---
TL;DR: PvP servers are different from what some people consider "real PvP," and they require a lot of patience to enjoy properly. 
---
I'll reroll my original dwarf priest. First and only character I ever played. Had over 300 days played when I quit early Cata. Considering I haven't touched the game in like 8 years now, I'm aiming for the full nostalgia experience. Getting giddy just typing about it.
---
Yes, but 1.5 frenzy is has less attack speed then 1.0 attack speed. Hence more crits, hence more dps
---
Pretty much. Too bad orc rogues look like hell.
---
If there's the option I will try the updated graphics and make my decision from there, playing ummmm somewhere atm and I've just never used the updated ones. I'll probably go back to original
---
Isn't that literally what happened when he played the demo?
---
haha:D In retail vanilla i had some issues on Nef, every single time during the add phase my computer would go to desktop and i would get a Vsync error and i had to tab back in, really annoying!
---
We also did the stair tactic in vanilla, doing the doorway on pserver and even though my memory is hazy, it feels alot better.
---
Lower crit damage too - I think the DPS difference between Brokentooth and any other cat is quite small.
---
Strength enchant
---
Yep - at the deepest level it has nothing to do with the actual fighting. The world in addition to having much tougher mobs than retail has the added danger of watching out for the enemy faction. The enemy faction is actually the enemy - not different colored people you can’t interact or compete with. That said you can choose to be a merciless oppressor, a protector, an opportunist, an honorable duelist. 
---
Playing vanilla on a PvE server strips away an entire juicy layer that produces some of the best emergent gameplay. 
---
Wrong subreddit. This place is exclusively for vanilla WoW related content.
---
exactly this! I want everyone to be on the same page and givin people the retail wow graphics is the first step to bringing back transmog bc its "just the look" of your character. Its important as many other aspects that made vanilla vanilla.
---
well, a wrinkle or two
---
I have been approached a few people I played with in vanilla asking me to play Prot Warrior again so I can't really say no. First time around was a Nelf because it was literately the first toon I made. I love Nelfs but the warrior is going to be human for the extra skill and the extra rep. I do think I will be a bit more focused on alts as I think I made things extra difficult on me the first time by not being quick to level alts. 
---
You could argue that WoW being created was a first step towards BFA beucase we are there from Vanilla. Creating a separate branch doesnt insure that we dont get back to BFA or something like it in the future of Classic.
---
Blizzard new buzzword is accessibility, Going down the classic path and adding more content i dont see why anyone should believe they wouldnt do this at some point. Of those things in OP i can see a few of them turning into pure catch up mechnics so that people can take part in that new content. Just like they want to go back and change War 3 and give Janina and Sylvans a bigger story role.
---
I would argue going through the content we know of is less of a risk to Classic then hoping that BFA Mentality doesnt infect the First major change after Naxx.
---
I'm a healer at heart. Always been a (resto) shaman main on retail bar a stint in 4.2 and 4.3 as mage. Played Resto druid on Feenix up until mid naxx, so the only logical choice was to play a healing class in classic, and my guild is going alliance so it was down to priest or paladin. I can't identify much with the priest class fantasy, and paladins look beast in t2, so I'll be playing dwarf paladin. Dwarf because of the superior racials, treasure chest tracking, bonus frost resistance as well as stone form. That's all there is to it.  
---
    
---
That being said, I'm still gonna weigh my options if they mess with reckoning.
---
&gt; The flaw in raising level caps is if your not re-balancing all former content then your simply replaceing.
---
as I once said. I'd play retail, if I could just start leveling from Legion.
---
But, I'd have to pay 60€ for every character...
---
No one is imposing anything on anyone. The option to have a toggle for graphics is not some weird right or whatever bizarre moral argument you're trying to make. There are many ways you can modify your game which are also not available to you for lots of reasons, and having a character not look as their player intends *does in fact alter the dynamics of a social game.* People reacting to the so-called "rape face" dwarf in discord is one of many examples. People make comments on how my character looks in game all the time regardless of what I play and vice-versa, so how you look matters. The fact that so many people in this thread don't understand that and just say "well you're ruining the way *I* want to play the game" as though you're entitled to something extraneous to vanilla and it doesn't matter is genuinely laughable.
---
Actually OP is sitting at only 63% upvoted, so you probably have the popular opinion on this instead of him. 63 sounds high, but it's pretty controversial by reddit standards.
---
Lol he’s right though - he called out your nonsense and it’s not his job to go time stamp the specific snippet for you. 
---
Good stuff, appreciate it man. Race will come down to the loading screen I feel like haha.
---
but good stuff the dual pve / pvp spec is key and big time saver
---
very tempting if cant see talwent choices to go full enhance and just blow people up in PvP 1/10 times then just heal in raids. See you out there hombre!
---
Polygons are pixels too!
---
Male Troll Rogue.
---
I like the flavour Rogues had in vanilla I.E. learning poisons and lockpicking, plus I like the prospect of sneaking through Blackrock Depths and pickpocketing everyone inside. Trolls are just cool and always have been one of the most inspired aspects of WoW.
---
are you talking like back in the good old days of mister T ya now.... I pity the fool!. lol If so I understand and am sorry I just thought It was a little fitting for 7 year old armor is quite a site to see again along with my prized pronto dragon lol.
---
I feel that a lot of people didn't use the doorway method because the tank had to get into a perfect position. And you couldn't see anything, at least as melee because Chromaggus was the only thing in my screen.  
---
The stair method was more running, but gave more leeway on placement.
---
When I was taming pets on LH the spawn rate was (base spawn rate/current population) \* 2500.
---
Yea, pre expansion vanilla WoW. More specifically, the new Classic servers that Blizzard has announced to launch around summer 2019.
---
I'll play regardless. I don't care if there's changes or not.
---
night elf druid cuz my friends keep telling me they’re shit so i want to be better than them and heal their dungeons and listen to them cry when i only have one rez for 30 minutes
---
Nope - it will be common and widespread. Once widespread enough - it will become legitimized in the community and permanently alter the social dynamics of the game. 
---
In any given dungeon I have the right to roll on something that would be an upgrade. If I win it, I own it. I can vendor or disenchant it on the spot if I want. I can also choose to forgo the upgrade and sell it to the loser if I value gold more than the upgrade. This is exactly how loot dynamics will work in Classic with loot trading. 
---
Then there is the scam where I get 2 friends and we outroll people on pre-raid BiS and sell it back to them. All with plausible deniability. 
---
All this so Blizzard can avoid hiring a few more GMs and keep everything automated, got it.
---
Gotta get tailoring for those sweet truefaith vestments that you’ll wear until t2! Herb is a gold printing machine though
---
I know what sharding is. :) (And we don't know how many servers Blizzard will create for Classic, but that's not that important for the discussion. The only important thing is that they'll not create a thousand. There around only 500 servers currently.)
---
And I hope for a 2500 cap. Even 3500 is too much. But regardless, they promised sharding only for the starting zones and only for a limited time. When people move to the other zones, there shouldn't be any sharding. And with normal caps that means that only a very limited amount of people can be online at once (at most a few hundred thousand). Which is fine, that's what's all this is about. A lot of people log in, try it a little then log off and don't come back.
---
But there is no guarantee all those people will be spread evenly among the servers. Some will be way overpopulated. Then what? Much larger than original level caps (which is absolutely not Vanilla, although some private server people would love it)? Day long queues? Sharding everywhere (although they explicitly promised that won't be the case)? I foresee a lot of problems. I hope Blizzard will find an adequate solution, I'm just not really optimistic in this regard.
---
ohh I didn't hear about that thanks for telling me. I Am so looking forward to getting into some of that. 
---
I know. :) I used Bagnon, for example. But it's not really necessary. The same with the Auction House (and I'll most likely won't use it at all).
---
orcs are O.D. 
---
If Blizzard is insistent on using this loot system, then just implement a feature that displays how many of that peice of the loot each member of the party has.
---
So if, for example, \[Barman Shanker\] drops, every party member that has this item in their inventory, bank, etc. will show up on loot box.
---
Ex. \[Barman Shanker\]  - Priest1 - Quantity 0, Rogue1 - Quantity - 1, Warrior1 - Quantity 1. 
---
Then it will show if someone's being a ninja. Solved.
---
Undead rogue.
---
To harvest tears 
---
Thieves are also a tiny minority but can still hurt people and make their lives miserable...
---
Loot Trading is the perfect tool for thieves (ninjas).
---
Yea indeed. I played healer in retail and we stood at upper stairs, im fairly certain the melees and maybe the ranged DPS as well stood downstairs. Don't really know why we did it like that, but it worked :D
---
Everyone here commenting on this NEEDS to shut up about other garbage games and look at Rift before it dies. I had to stop playing because of the cash grabbiness of the game after it went f2p, but it had the best player housing system in any mmo I've ever seen.
---
Rift is all about planes and portals. You open a portal to your very own plane which is your property - you didn't even just have a house, you had land. You could buy and trade bigger planes with bigger more intricate houses and more land, even.
---
You could customize anything, and I mean anything and decorate how you wanted to. You could change the size of any item you find for your plane, including rocks and furniture. You could put anything anywhere in your plane. Unless they improved the system further, everything was simply decorative, but still neat. I don't think it'd take much to add items with actual functions anyway.
---
And players could absolutely see your plane, you just had to invite them to it and they could teleport there.
---
It was super intricate and robust for a housing system. Super on theme and we'll integrated into the story and world. And I say all that as someone who doesn't even care that much about player housing!
---
 Too bad it had to go F2P and became terrible though, it couldve easily been the "next wow" if it had managed to become more popular.
---
&gt; Blizzard new buzzword is accessibility
---
Come on, there were pure catch up mechanics, just not as deadly - old raids would still matter a lot. Legendaries, unique items, etc. Even after dire maul and zul'gurub.
---
Though there could be more ways to moake old content meaningful - but, that would include things similar to artifact system. Sockets, new item slots, etc. And you would have to farm something from some raids, to unlock the new slots.
---
Female orc rogue, combat daggers spec. Insanely high burst DPS, excellent gear scaling at fresh 60 due to the reliablity of backstab crits. It's a versatile pvp/pve spec.
---
Azshara had the unreleased Battleground "Azshara Crater" which has some artwork and a map file in-game (but not reachable without a GM) - it is possible to ride into the actual crater (there are a couple YouTube videos) but it's basically a bunch of trees.
---
Kara raid might tie in well with Vanilla lore + content, but since that was also released in TBC they would have to re-tune it for level 60 content. Deadwind Pass would be a logical place for a few lead-in quests for this content.
---
Hyjal has a lot of artwork (and a raid portal!) but it would take some additional work - there is something to build off of, though.
---
The Ulduar quest line just sort of died out. It would make sense to add some level 60 quests. Not sure if there's enough there to build an entire zone off of, and an instance doesn't really fit with the Vanilla lore, imo.
---
Grim Batol would be interesting - as I recall, there is an entrance there but no instance portal.
---
They still haven't figured out how to implement Emerald Dream in retail, not sure how this could fit in Classic.
---
So PVP focus or PVE focus? For the PVE focus armorsmith. The BOP FR resist pieces are pretty nice. The items that are BOP for weaponsmiths aren't that great and anything else you'd want from an axesmith like nightfall is BOE.  
---
Human and Dwarf are excellent races for PVE. Dwarf and gnome is better for PVP. Nelf is fine but shadowmeld in vanilla isn't as useful as it is in live.   
---
As to leveling professions, I'd pick engineering or blacksmithing and mining to start. Get your toon up and cap the profession and then as you level and alt with mining i'd drop the mining on the main and start leveling the secondary profession as you level mining on the alt.
---
If its on the same wow subscription, many of those tourists might come from retail. Wouldnt it make sense to just usebthe current server infrastructure forvclassic as well? I felt like thats what they are trying to do... 
---
&gt; what is it and what helped you determine that?
---
Kind of the whole point of Classic is to go back and play a game from 14 years ago. I'll be playing a night elf druid, because that's what I made when I first started playing.
---
Simple, yes?
---
honestly, i use Joana's guide. It is step by step, but I like it because it shows you where you need to be at a certain level. Yes it tell you where exactly to go, but if you just kind of glance it over then go back into the game it's nice. Generally, i get a sense of where to go and what to do , then rely on the quest text for help. 
---
Quest in vanilla are all over the place and take you all over the place so it's nice to have a little bit of a guide or help. 
---
You can figure out the quest just by reading them though. Almost all of them anyhow 99%
---
&gt; quest line from Sunken Temple which just sort of ended with a trinket reward and a conversation with an NPC in the cave in Swamp of Sorrows. I always felt like there could be more to that story.
---
just like emerald dragons
---
just fyi (maybe i misunderstood) but brokentooth is not any higher dps than other cats/raptors (raptors and cats have max dps of +10%). He is "best" because his 1.0 speed will make more caster pushback in pvp, that's it. 
---
Well sure, a few apples and silk cloth added to the target dummy recipe and you're a player!
---
I'm fairly set on troll priest but part of me still yearns for the Tauren and maybe a Warrior or Druid.
---
I swear if I could be a Tauren Priest I'd be sooo happy. 
---
I won't probably play if the graphics are the same as 2005, sorry but no. I want the real Vanilla gameplay, but the graphics must be adapted to 2019. It would be shameful to have a 1500€+ computer and run the game as if it was 2005.
---
&gt; an instance doesn't really fit with the Vanilla lore, imo.
---
why not?
---
&gt; They still haven't figured out how to implement Emerald Dream in retail, not sure how this could fit in Classic.
---
They did, but with that red shit.
---
But, the Druid trainer told me that one day I'd meditate/sleep in the Emerald Dream - so, can say it's promised.
---
Pets can also get in the way on fights like Geddon as they can become the bomb I believe? 
---
If memory serves me right that was entirely a BC thing. There is Gurubashi Arena but that is an open one out in the world (STV) with chest rewards.
---
&gt;  It would be shameful to have a 1500€+ computer and run the game as if it was 2005.
---
It's a shame no matter what they do to the graphics. That computer is far over speced for anything WoW can do. 
---
Same, but priest.
---
I sucked with dps in TBC raids and was lucky they even kept me around each week. Healing was where I found my niche. I really seemed to be appreciated as a good healer through wrath and cata so i would like to approach vanilla with my strong foot forward.
---
But hes just a scrub pretending to be good at pvp with movie maker special effects /s
---
G U R U B A S H I
---
Definitely not Gurubashi, that was just a gank fest.
---
My wife might be sold if Blizzard included options for new water physics and such.
---
Arena skirmishes were available in the tbc prepatch (2.0+), technically during the final months of vanilla.
---
Ranked arena was never available because the first arena season didn't start until after TBC was out.
---
Hmmmm, Wrathgate in WotLK tops the list for me.
---
But Ally Ony chain might be a close second ;)
---
Mage was a pretty obvious choice for me. I always liked the class and i'm excited to play it again on Classic. Race however, was and still is a struggle. I keep switching between Gnome and Undead. I have to decide if i want to go for the "Alliance easy win path" or for the challenging and more rewarding (imho) playstyle of the Horde. For now is 60% UD 40% Gnome.
---
Lol creepy. Is that not allowed or something?
---
See I'm too noob to even know da rules~
---
Undead mage. The advantage in pvp mainly and my friends are playing horde 
---
Maybe if the developers focused on gameplay over a cosmetic housing system it would have done better.. And i enjoyed Rift at launch.  
---
I believe this is correct. One of my favorite wow videos of all time came during this time.
---
5 boomkins in arena. 
---
https://youtu.be/_vTDtnW6vnc
---
Boomkin: Pretty decent for world pvp, but honestly the moonkin form is usually not worth it, it just limits you too much for small stat increases. Not too bad in BG's but not good either.
---
Enhancement shammy again is pretty strong in world pvp useless in BG's 
---
Combat rogue can still pop cd's and oneshot people but other than that they are really shit.
---
demonology warlock? What exactly do you mean by this? By demonology you could mean soul link? Which is one of the best(if not the best) warlock pvp spec.
---
Ret paladin is also  pretty good in world pvp, not so useful in BG's since you have no mobility and can be ignored fairly easily.
---
Fury warrior has good damage they just don't have the burst and mortal strike from arms. Especially when you are AQ geared you can actually really destroy people in pvp as a fury warrior (see swifty iguess).
---
Highly disagree.  SM/Ruin is the best of all worlds.  You can be the raider that gives blood pact, you can 1v3 hold LM or just own people in the middle of WSG.  Nothing like charming one, fear chaining another, and then killing the third.  Never need to respec for raiding or PvP.  SL is super boring imo, conflagrate was fun, but I hated eating immolate and play style just seemed bursty, squishy and janky imo.  SM/Ruin had great shadow damage, crazy shadow bolt crits and was just more fun that anything else.  There wasn't a class I couldn't beat 1v1 with having corruption, affliction, immolate all ticking and getting shadow bolt crits followed by an instant shadow bolt proc.  If they still weren't dead follow it up with the deathcoil and fit in one more SB.  The spec literally feels like your an OP mage with a hell of a lot more CC.
---
&gt; You do understand the futility of your post and opinion in the era of Discord and Battle.net integration, don't you?
---
So 'No', then?
---
Some of us are playing classic simply because we want TBC and Wrath to eventually come out. I think Vanilla is better in a lot of ways than retail, but Wrath is my real endgame in this whole thing. The instant wrath goes out the window as a possibility I'm bailing.
---
Okay thanks, I knew I wasn't crazy. 
---
I played a rogue main in vanilla and then rolled a priest for WoTLK and clearly remembered playing arena as a rogue. 
---
I wouldn't mind a non-ranked arena being in vanilla. It technically is #nochanges.
---
Warrior or Priest -- 
---
My original char was a warrior shortly after WoW launched.  I tried to level sword and board with the prot tree, basically had no idea what I was doing, and got burned out around level 42 when someone else told me I was only "halfway."  
---
I like tanking, and I have always been drawn to the melee classes over the caster classes in games.  I also like the idea of trying to top dmg meters if/when I get into raids.  
---
BUT - Leveling a warrior is either "not so bad" or "absolute hell on earth."   I worry that i will burn out again trying to crawl a warrior to max level.  I also want to play on a PvP server and it just seems like a warrior leveling on a PvP server is just a free honor kill for anyone on the opposite side -- so that doesn't sound like much fun.
---
Priest I like as well.  Fun toolkit, and I don't mind healing.  Plus leveling a priest on a PvP server seems so much easier.  They might not be the best 1v1 class without shadow form, but at least they have some CC and other ways to at least "get away."
---
Priest also seems easier to gear BUT the new meta seems to be that there are no lack of healers at level 60, and getting into dungeon groups isn't going to be like it was in the old days.  Priests might have a hard time running 5-mans and even have a hard time getting into raid groups since everyone knows how good a class they are now.  Playing a dwarf as my main also wouldn't be my favorite way to play the game, that's for sure. 
---
What to do?
---
So let's ban all kinds of things that might be tools for thieves? 
---
You're 100% correct, there's good reasons for the decisions Blizz is making even if they're not perfectly in the interest of the Classic community. Mostly I think it's important to keep Blizz's reasoning in mind when talking about early sharding, since some people don't seem to see how radically different the situation for Classic is compared to original vanilla.
---
Only new thing is modern foliage, water and post process effects. Models, textures and animations are the same.
---
Undead female mage, with short hair and no extra features. I love the playstyle, the control in pvp, the daamage in pve and also the ability to Aoe farm which i love to do, i had no problems getting 100g+/hour when i did that, and the leveling will be fun with friends. Can't wait!
---
http://vanillagaming.org/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=nv7gpo9lgbscqh54je4n92f1s7&amp;topic=16557.msg131139#msg131139
---
Take a peak at this. The dps difference is small 30 between top dps (BT) and bottom. But as it stands fast attack speed pets do seem to give e a greater increase in dps than slower pets.
---
The story line just didn't seem like a huge part of the original story that players learned while leveling/questing. They already did Uldaman. Not sure how another instance could expand on the Uldum story from Vanilla.
---
BUT if my friend decided to roll alliance I'm going fury warrior female human for those sweet racials and i really don't like the male looks.
---
No, it won't be widespread. 
---
Claiming it would be widespread is - once again, as with all "concerns" and "arguments" against loot trading - completely based on the assumption that the vast majority of Classic players will be anti-social, egoistic assholes that care neither for the community nor for their reputation within it.
---
Sorry for repeating myself here, but it stays true nonetheless. And the Classic community WON'T be primarily assholes.
---
Abusing loot trading like that will be noticed, people who do it will be called out and ruin their reputation, because it will NOT be legitimized. 
---
What red shit are you referring to?
---
I know this EXACT feeling. I was camping broken tooth for two days.... I had made out a spawn and ran over as fast as I could....Troll hunter scares beast and kills me....tames broken tooth and runs away....I dont think I have ever been more pissed in my entire life XD !
---
How did you come up with the time to complete? The Blackrock depths time seems low to me to kill every boss in there. I think there are 20 bosses?
---
I honestly never use reddit but I needed more Classic hype and this is the only place I can think of. And the official forums.
---
The dps increase is minor but increased crits means faster attacks which means slightly more dps. Take a look. Also amazing for pushback on casters yes
---
Leading up to sacking the Undercity. That was so epic.
---
This was made by Brady Games in 2006. I just slapped it together
---
Technically 2.0 is not Vanilla, it's TBC ;)
---
ahh ok. I will say I think their time estimates are a bit off. Like the format of how it's presented though. 
---
I just read a section about that in *The WoW Diary* last night. Apparently the devs began to develop a healthy distaste for promotional material and journalists around 2002 (though promotion was always low on the list of dev priority at the time) and it was their way of tongue-in-cheek way of responding to those sorts of questions at trade shows. Journalists weren't really fond of them either because of it - no good sound bites or time lines or anything, while other MMO companies were talking their asses off and promising the moon when all they had to show was a cinematic or something.          
---
          
---
I'm really enjoying the insight into the skill and dedication that original vanilla team had in making WoW.
---
&gt;how much this forum cares to talk about that stuff
---
In my experience not very much, but you'll probably get a couple takers.
---
&gt; you don't need 60-70 to make the burning crusade expansion work, you can expand on a world and never raise the level cap which would serve in actually expanding a game, not replaceing other content.
---
Out of all of the problems I had with later expansions, the raising level cap was never among them. Older content becoming irrelevant is simply how the game works. Uldaman and Sunken temple are level 50-ish dungeons. How often do you run those after you reach 60 and have gear from level 60 content?
---
Basically never, right?
---
Yet nobody is particularly bothered by this. So why be bothered if level 60 dungeons being obsolete once you reach 70? The whole game works this way. It's not a problem. The actual problems are far more complex and not related to this at all. It was changes in design philosophy. It was how content progression sped up and became a perpetual treadmill. It was the sudden _lurch_ in power growth that retroactively obsoleted things in a non-smooth manner.
---
It was showing up to Hellfire Peninsula and JimBob McQuestGiver asking you to spend five minutes killing some hellboars and handing you a green that was better than 95+% of what was current content the previous day.
---
Vanilla had a _relatively_ smooth-ish progression. Unlocking new content didn't instantly render everything prior to it obsolete. Look at [instances by level](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Instances_by_level). There's a lot of overlap. You first gain access to Maraudon at level 46, and to Sunken Temple at 50. But when you reach level 50, Mara is still relevant for 5 more levels. This same basic thing happened with raids too. When Blackwing lair was released, it still made sense to run Molten Core.
---
WoW expansions have tended to instantly obsolete everything that happened before them. Yes, exceptions exist. Thunderfury, etc. But in general the moment an expansion arrives, everything that exists prior to it becomes pointless and irrelevant.
---
And _that's_ a problem. Not raising the level cap.
---
Combine that with how much fast and easy leveling has been in most expansions, and even if they had maintained some smoothness of progressino, and the value of it woudl still have been lost. It maybe wasn't this way so much with the Burning Crusade, and not _completely_ bad with Wrath...but in general WoW new-expansion leveling has been a thing that you quickly rush through to get to max level.
---
When you played vanilla and first made level 50 and unlocked that new dungeon, did you:
---
A) Run the dungeon
---
B) Completely ignore it plus everything else you unlock for the next ten levels in a mad rush to get to 60
---
I think a lot more people chose A than B. To some extent, it's because the playerbase has changed. And to some extent it's simply that the content became easier. Grinding through the plaguelands was way harder and slower than the the "quest for 40 minutes and ding" of later expansions. In vanilla, each new level was generally harder to get than the previous. With expansions, suddenly level 61 became as easy as level 41 was, or levels 71-74 became as easy as 50. Roughly. It's been a long time. Forgive me if my time estimates are off, and again, BC wasn't bad about this. But in general, early post-expansion leveling has tended to be so fast that it's _pointless_ to try to "enjoy" the new content when you can simply run quests and render everything you might do today irrelevant by tomorrow.
---
That's the problem. Not the ever-rising level cap.
---
Yeah, every decent podcast app can do that
---
I've only recently discovered this delight 
---
well thats vanillagaming, it even says right there pets are not completely blizzlike on that serv. Also even if it was correct, no hunter is speccing deep BM for frenzy except when lvling, so at 60 it's irrelevant. And having 1.0 vs say, 1.2 or 1.4 attack speed, should all be fast enough to result in a 100% uptime on frenzy anyway
---
Don't forget to spec your pet according to the raid. MC - fire resistance etc.
---
Josh I really love your work man, and as a hard working father, your podcast means so much to me while I’m patrolling the sketchy streets of downtown Portland. I’ve probably listened to the Hunter, Naxxramas, and Joana episodes about 6 times each. Such high quality and I get just as excited to see a new Countdown To Classic episode as I do when Joe Rogan releases a new podcast. Thanks again M8!
---
&gt; Wait, if server merges happened in Vanilla,
---
Vanilla ended before they killed the game. There was no need for server mergers. What happened from time to time was a "free transfer of" from overcrowded servers.
---
Orc warlock. 
---
Process was as follows for picking class:
---
• I knew I was going horde cause rl friends are
---
• I watched several guides explaining the pros and cons of each class and determined Warlock was my sweet spot. A) Leveling is quicker compared to other classes (minus hunter). B) warlocks are strong in pvp and have several viable specs, as well as pve by AQ40. C) I knew as a working adult to have a shot at semi-hardcore pace for raids, I'd need to pick a fast leveler. D) I've always enjoyed casters. 
---
Process as follows for race selection (orc or undead):
---
• At first I was in favor of undead, but then learned how broken orc racial is for pvp and since warlock lacks mobility having stun resist is amazing. 
---
• I like how gear looks on the orc a bit better overall. 
---
Boomkin: Not good, but you can play a spec that has most of it's points in balance, but not the Moonkin talent. https://youtu.be/vCvb8MwvsD4
---
Enh Shammy: Not viable IMO. Too dependent of luck. Pretty sure plenty of people will disaggree with me tho
---
Combat Rogue: Yup, even a 0/0/0 talent rogue is awesome, so... :p
---
Arcane Mage: Like "Moonkin", would be better to be Arcane/Fire spec than pure arcane.
---
Demonology Warlock: Same thing. You can get soul link and be awesome
---
Ret Paladin: Yes, it is viable
---
Fury War: Viable as well, but Arms is better
---
Yay!  Shit Dwarf!
---
Dude me too. I’m doing patrols in a car 10 hours a night 6 days a week. Countdown is Life
---
The best raw healing spec is 21/30 disc down to divine spirit and holy down to 5/5 spiritual healing. Mental strength is not a great talent compared to spiritual healing or spiritual guidance, and the 4 points required after mental strength to hit PI are basically wasted if your goal is raw healing.
---
Personally, when I first hit 60 on Classic I'll respec to 31/20 disc with PI and holy with 3/3 improved healing.
---
When we first hit 60 MC and Onyxia will be the main raids. These are so easy that guilds compete over clear times, not over who downs what first. Therefore since power infusion serves situationally as a DPS increase it fits that purpose. Since PI can serve as a burst healing increase it also serves that purpose. The disadvantage is the lack of 10%+ overall healing.
---
The other, main reason is because after hitting 60 we will be expected to do lots of dungeons, solo questing, grinding, profession leveling, PVP. A PI spec allows 4/5 force of will talents, plus PI for burst dps, and the main smite/holy fire talents like 2/2 searing light can be chosen in the holy tree. So this offers burst and versatility. The normal 21/30 healing spec would work with autowanding but I prefer not to. A holy fire opener &gt; inner focus &gt; holy fire &gt; spite spam nuke is pretty powerful in pvp.
---
In short, the normal 21/30 healing spec has the advantage of being more mana efficient overall, since 31/20 can always spam flash heals to make up for hps. In general, any mana you have left over at the end of a fight is wasted. This will happen regularly early on with dungeons and MC. So aside from drinking less often, or requiring less healers in MC which allows for more dps slots, I don't see a distinct advantage to 21/30 early on. So it's personal preference. Sorry I knew this would turn into a TLDR.
---
I would still put Onyxia first only because of the grand scope of what it meant back then.
---
You leveled up the entire game with this woman seeming to be second in command to your faction with Bolvar. Then suddenly she exposes herself as a raid boss right then and there in your capital city! It was mind blowing at the time.
---
Yes wrathgate was great but it’s hard to describe the impact of this moment back in Vanilla.
---
I know how strong the #nochanges crowd is but I would love 2v2 / 3v3 / 5v5 as an option.  Even if it's for no rewards just to derp around and have fun.  Or cosmetic titles/mounts or something.  You can't change the gear structure of course, like giving out epics for arena that's definitely a no-no.  But basically, arena is fun.  It's not for everyone, but for those who want to why not?  Give them something else to do and not affect the meta of gearing or PVP. 
---
Very useful, thank you :)
---
The fact that Hunter is my only option because I work 60 hours to week to support my wife and daughter. And Tauren is the coolest race. That’s my reasoning 
---
What about StarCraft 2?
---
Soon **™** 
---
Garona would have a word. 
---
With a warrior clearly don't try to level prot. Arms is probably your strongest bet to level on a PVP server. And just remember, everything hard in leveling for a warrior is rewarded at the end with strong dps and the ability to tank. If you feel a little burnt you can always switch and level something else and then go back. 
---
I would disagree. I never paid for any expansion!
---
Check out - www.reddit.com/r/workingadultsguild
---
We could use another warrior or a Nightfall wielding enhance shaman!
---
Imagine choosing to spend days of playtime on a game based on the water physics
---
Use a surrogate mother
---
I would enjoy it, but I understand why people would be against it.  
---
I always wanted to have party duels added. 2v2, 3v3, etc.  I know the forums used to have people posting about it and asking for it all throughout vanilla.  I was always surprised it never was patched in.
---
Male orc warrior....my DK's life before turning.  I'm going to rp the fuck out of it.  Going to have a family and a small farm a pet crag bore.  Taking applications for children, wifey is taken, y'all got to be shamans, hunters or warriors though because my character is vehemently against dark magic (technically you'd all be half orc/trolls).  Although I could see rebellious son being corrupted by influences discovered in the Cleft of Shadow. Up to you really, it's your character.  Just understand that if I catch you summoning imps and void walkers I'm going to put you through the fucking wall.  
---
I'd be okay with the new character models as an *option*, but they shouldn't be the default or only option just to 'adapt' to 2019.
---
Poopsocks were used in Everquest not Wow. The only poopsockers that carried over play prot Paladin.
---
I still think it was "In Dreams" at the end of the Tirion questline.
---
This is damn good though.
---
This is a thumbnail for me.
---
Had ne priest I would spec disc for the pi and a buddy would spec for pyroblast. So much fun hurling giant fireballs at horde using the fp in hammerfall.
---
I made this graph from the **active** accounts on this survey, separating the professions as single.
---
i.e.: If someone is enchanter + herbalist and another alchemist + herbalist
---
Therefore are 2 herbalists, 1 enchanter &amp; 1 alchemist.
---
My question is where are the JC and Inscription? Does anyone have those professions or those people just don't read this forum haha
---
[Prof. graph from active accounts on survey](https://ibb.co/pPGDJxw)
---
If the models looking like 2010 models over 2004 models will actually influence your decision as to whether or not you will sink hundreds of hours into a game, then I don't think anyone here can save you.
---
Yeah, I feel like the ret hate was less about the spec in tbc and more about the hate left from vanilla.
---
Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Enjoy your prison cell.

24yo EU based Med student looking for a hardcore/semi-hardcore EU PVE guild (dkp based system pref.) 
---
Looking for competent leadership + a strong core guild .Im also interested in speedrun's &amp; ranking thru premades at the start of the server life ( but its a bit scetchy to do that with med school)
---
A bit about me below: 
---
Never played the classic ''classic'' . My expirience began a few years ago around private servers . I've played on a few of them thru the years all of which would be considered blizzlike or atleast as blizzlike as the private community can provide.
---
I have the knowledge of all consumables &amp; encounters req for speed runs (even tho i have not been a part of a guild that was interested in them)
---
I've cleared all content on two of my mains &amp; fucked around bwl/aq  on my alts.
---
Never missed a guild raid in my guild raiding history.But im not highly interested in joining 20 mans once i've accuaired the gear that i need from those places duo to time work/studys/time. But im up for any clean organized runs regardless :P
---
I'll be ontop of my game &amp; consumables every on every raid that we are proggressing  &amp; will slack with consums on stuff that we have on farm.
---
I prefer Horde side as it is currently but i am willing to roll alliance for the right people.
---
My expirience lays in healing Resto Shamy/ H pala but im also looking into any of the following classes that i have a bit less expirience on 
---
Mages,warlocks,hunters,warriors
---
Hit me up here or via email if you think i might be a good addition to your guild or if you want some more information .
---
Orc Huntard. I'm going to be busy with work and family, so hunter for level and gold making efficiency and Orc because LOK'TAR OGAR.
---
I prefer dwarf hunter. Dealing with shamans is way easier than paladins. Paladins have blessing of freedom.  Holy paladins way harder to kill, and they bof all the warriors so you can’t kite them. Shamans are squishier, and way easier to lock down. 
---
Stun resist is really awesome, but it’s also basically 1/3 chance. So 2/3 time you have no advantage. 
---
Dwarf hunter is stronger vs rogues, stronger against warriors( 10% damage reduction and bleed removal &gt; 1/3 chance to resist charge stun). Dwarf is stronger vs other hunters (poison removal and 10% dmg reduction &gt; 1/3 chance to resist intimidation which only 1/3 hunters would have.) dwarf is stronger vs priest (removes devouring plague, 90% of horde PvP priest are UD). 
---
Mage is equal difficulty for orc/dwarf. 
---
Orc gets slight advantage for Druid (but Druid is a very easy matchup so doesn’t really matter). 
---
Side note. viper sting gets spammed in BGs. Removing it is amazing. 
---
Dwarf hunter &gt; orc hunter 
---
&gt; So here is my question- are PVP servers more fun than PVE and why? 
---
Fun is subjective.
---
There is obviously much more to do on a PvP server, and the community is also much more active, interconnected and stronger. But, the leveling speed is also slower (everyone will die at the hands of the opposite faction countless of times), the griefing and camping are real enough for many players to hate (for a short time) that they rolled on a PvP server, losing world buffs at raid instances is another real possibility, fight for herbs/ore veins is almost 100% certain.
---
But, bug World PvP battles are also almost certain, and they are actually fun.
---
In terms of diversity of activities, a PvP server offers the maximum possible.
---
Yeah the Gurubashi arena was one attempt but being permanently FFA was of course complicated.  
---
#somechanges!
---
As long as it doesn't affect meta then it really doesn't matter.  You can't get gear from it, hell make it so you literally can't get ANYTHING from it- no tabard or anything!  Could just keep track of rating points or win/loss and let the leaderboards show each week so people can compete if they want.  It'd be fun. 
---
Undead warlock.  I did Alliance only during vanilla,  now I want to experience the other side.
---
Warlock because I ended up liking them the most.
---
I can't zoom in enough to read the descriptions. 
---
Interesting point ! The dps gain even if realized is +-30 dps so certainly not groundbreaking. 
---
100% has way more impact on PVP if anything.
---
We need a savior 
---
I remember when i was leveling up my 2nd char i went to the keep for some reason. As soon as i got there this event started and then the dragonkins that spawned wrecked me and everyone else. It was cool and unexpected even though i died.
---
Heliosan just joined in.  Thanks!
---
&gt; You leveled up the entire game with this woman seeming to be second in command to your faction with Bolvar. Then suddenly she exposes herself as a raid boss right then and there in your capital city! It was mind blowing at the time.
---
Wow spoilers...
---
I like the idea that they never archived their code.
---
I'm not even sure about that - I think I want to do it all, though I do want to see all raiding, but not grind to rank 14...
---
As for shadowmeld, I just see opening with charge, defending, surprise attacks, and being afk for more than eight seconds without being dead, all useful traits!
---
Which BoP plans are armorsmith exclusive? As far as I can see, everything an armorsmith makes is BoE...
---
I was considering concurrent leveling, getting a bunch of everything at once. Otherwise, I would do that too.
---
Don't forget fear ward!
---
Bang a Gong?
---
The quality of image for some of the dungeons is pixelated to the point of preventing reading for me when  you zoom in. Anyone else get this?
---
Maybe if you want Dal'rends, you join a group where you are the only rogue? Maybe ask the rogues currently in the group if they need the Dal'rends and then decide if you want to run the instance? Perhaps if you are super paranoid, don't join groups with more than 2 people in a specific guild, especially if both those players are rogues? 
---
I mean it would be super obvious if a mage was rolling on the item just to give to his rogue friend. Would happen once or twice before people know not to group with that mage/rogue/guild etc.
---
This issue just seems totally blown out of proportion to me.
---
No I am not. The patch notes clearly state the seal now does damage on every swing. If it means what you say then the patch notes would state the same thing twice. 
---
In either case, my interpretation of the patch notes is a lot more logical than your intepretation of those TBC patchnotes.
---
3 hour time to complete SFK and the same for uldaman? 1,5 hours to complete stockades? Was the guy who made this high or what :D
---
Male dwarf hunter leveling BM with a boar till level 30 then ill swap to the black / blue wind serpent from WC to level 60. Then ill get a white owl from winter spring and a wolf from LBRS to fill all my pet needs.
---
the only part that will suck is when ZG comes out ill have to drop a pet to tame the wind serpent from the raid for rank 6 lightning breath.
---
I know they will use their [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) thing, but I really hope they do some stuff to make it seem like the launcher. Maybe they could make similar interface, the background, maybe they could add a sound when you click play... hell, I really want the launcher.
---
I think you linked the wrong image
---
Enjoy the rpg aspect of it and the zones|music is great 
---
&gt;What makes for the best poop sock?               
---
                
---
Clearly soccer socks. They're super stretchy and long for fitting over shin pads. You could go for a week or more without having to change your sock!
---
Not having flying mounts was also CLEARLY a bug since they added that in TBC.
---
Come up with some evidence that SoR proccing things was a bug, or stop embarassing yourself further.
---
I dont even think they get a learner's permit at 500 years old
---
No more reckbombs is also a good reason to roll priest vs pally. If you cared about it.
---
Nothing says 'vanilla wow' like being inconvenienced by someone else's quest like this.
---
I look forward to the return of these persistent-world spontaneous social experiences.
---
I always thought this was a bug on private servers?  I might be wrong. 
---
Lol dawg I can’t tell if you are serious or not but how you gonna call spoilers on a 15 year old game for one of the main pieces of lore.
---
Sorry edited for spoilers.
---
And kind of. She gives you dirty looks and rude comments but not enough to make you think she’s a raid boss lol
---
Same for me. Classic is better than retail but as soon tbc and wotlk drops I m playing on those.
---
Came to say the same. Everyone, yourself and the entire fucking server, was paying attention like no tomorrow. Now, that's a proper quest climax and the one that set the bar that no other gaming related quest, period, have ever reached since.
---
It'll also make it easier to report more people for toxic language so I love a world channel!
---
I played alliance in vanilla and was pretty amazed at that quest line ending. But it never really occurred to me, what was the horde story like for it?
---
I would say most classes have a hybrid spec.  As a rogue, I would use a pve spec when new content opened up, and then go more of a pvp spec.  Once we cleared out MC the first time, I spec'd full PVP because I got Perdition's on our first Rag kill and I still topped all DPS charts.
---
I would say Rogue's, Mages, and Lock's have the most hybrid friendly talent trees for PVP and PVE.  Warriors can be decent too as long as you aren't a MT.
---
I'm going to roll Shaman this type around and plan to raid with a hybid spec depending on how the guilds are that I join. 
---
Holy Paladin. You can PvP and PvE in the same spec. For the majority of classes you have to PvE if you want to PvE though. Just too many good items from raids.
---
Look at pservers. They live for years on the same patch. I rather looking forward to tbc, wotlk and would hop between those.
---
Fuck you I hate myself and you can't make me
---
You better believe I slow walked into Stormwind when doing this quest. 
---
I think it would be a fun way to compete for additional PvP titles, but I'd be worried that e.g. 2v2 might prove to be the meta for honor farming and kill wpvp.  So it would have to be strictly arena rank only, no honor gains.
---
What a dumb fucking list. The clear times for every single one is absurdly high compared to how long it should take to clear it. It also says 10man for most of the leveling dungeons, which we all know wont be possible to do in Classic.
---
You don't have to buy any expansions, just a subscription.
---
[I wrote on this subject](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RiAIVQ6ye44iMPLFbHmVbll7HrkwwIbUB2yCn0Yg1PY/edit).
---
&gt; Be an orc if you are serious about PvP. Warlock’s cannot trinket out of stun so the orc stun resist racial (“hardiness”) is superb for PvP. The often forgotten and minor racial 5% increased pet damage (“Command”) is nice too. Undead is a tiny bit better for PvE, (e.g. tanking Twin Emps in AQ40 because of shadow resist racial.)
---
Troll racial is shit for Warlock is shit and deserves no consideration.
---
oh arent you a genious
---
Lol the time to completion certainly taking into account the "looking for group" &amp; travel time.
---
Night elf hunter solely for shadowmeld. Pet stealth+shadowmeld is an incredible combo for world pvp.
---
I believe dark iron breastplate is BOP. Armorsmiths also get to make all of the dark iron armor which will almost always be in reasonable demand. You would also be able to make the lionheart helm if you can get the plans etc. I was a swordsmith in classic and it was fine, but the armorsmiths always had an advantage and just as much or more profitable skills. Although things like nightfall and arcanite reaper will be of some demand for an axesmith.
---
Thunderfury. 
---
I mean they don't have boosted xp rates or anything, but the speed they complete quests, grind mobs and the amount of downtime they have are all better than paladins, it's not an exaggeration to say if you can only play a few hours a week playing a Hunter could end up with you shaving months off of your leveling time
---
Ah yes the rape face of dwarves.
---
If it sucks it won’t take long for private servers to spring back up, so that’s good news.
---
I preferred the ZG Bat back in Vanilla, same attack speed and the super annoying screech was great, good to see the dps was pretty much the same.  
---
I don't see wind serpents on the list, I wonder how they do in comparison. Also, with the added DPS of howl, they must come out ahead overall for damage?
---
Op is talking about pvp, i know that in theory sm ruin is the jack of all trades... just answer the question...
---
that's is what we need more of guys, isn't this dude just an inspiration
---
Yeah, just because it's 15 years old that automatically means that every person alive and any future living humans will know everything about the lore. Completely reasonable.
---
That's not even close to the intro Forsaken quest lines which end up with Sylvanas dying....nevermind WrathGate.
---
Sure. If you find the right buyer. Pserver can also pay your wow sub.
---
How do you say “what are you talking about“ in orcish ;-)
---
Which will happen anyway. Even on pservers gold selling was a thing. It will happen but within blizzard.
---
Then pick the class you enjoy the class fantasy of. Not the class that does the highest dps.
---
From the articles and videos I've seen recently...you don't want to make anything for Activision-Blizzard.
---
For those who dont get it: you can talk to the guy to get ported to MC or you can jump through that window. BUT if you dont have the prequest done, you will die in the lava (that happens yes)
---
Notably, in patch 1.10 all dungeons - except for Blackrock Spire - were capped at 5 players.  Bradygames has a weird, mixed-bag of caps in the image.
---
Lol this is ridiculous
---
If they feel spoiled too bad
---
I just let my sub run out this week. Best of luck to those whho stayed..
---
I don't know if these two would qualify but I like the AQ and nax stories much better. 
---
I dont think that this is a LOT of content to tell you the truth. Most guilds will probably raid 2-3 times a night and this is all content that will be easily done in 3 nights.  
---
You'll have MC done in about 2 hours (max more than likely), BWL which will take 3-4 probably the first few clears, then  you have Onyxia and ZG which can be done on the third night. its a lot of content, but its not really long content.   
---
I guess this is also coming from a guy playing Everquests TLPs right now where I'm expected to raid 3-4 nights a week and we put a full 4 hours in each night + sometimes go over that 4 hour schedule.... I'm thinking classic is going to be amazing for me ;D
---
Jumping through the window?  It was a thing in 2005/2006.
---
Undead male frost mage. Mage has been my favorite class since vanilla. I’ve tried all classes and mage is by far the best class for me. I also hate playing any melee class, other than maybe a rogue.
---
Heading to molten core etc. on a pvp server is a unique experience.
---
As someone who did both, Ally had the more epic version. The requirements were similar but there was no major surprise or implications like this in the Hordes version. 
---
Okay my bad then. 
---
Great list !  
---
Can you add color on the text column "Alliance Horde" for better understanding ?  
---
&gt; 1,5 hours to complete stockades?
---
You can complete stocks in 1.5 hours, even if you're currently at work and don't get off for 45 minutes then run to make the train.
---
Could just make inviting to a group disable FFA in the STV, Orgrimmar and Dire Maul arena. Rubbing around pillars hasnt be fun for the entirety of arena gameplay anyways.
---
&gt;  someone else will.
---
We're 15 years in and no one has yet. I think you might be setting yourself up for disappointment buddy.  
---
Ah, memories.  I fucking raged when they eliminated attack speeds and stripped away what made him unique.
---
Yeah, everyone fucking knows.
---
This sub is such a humourless pit.
---
OW is SJW cancer, balance the game around bad players, and every idea in that game was stolen from another. Hearthstone is online MTG. 
---
You're either missing the point intentionally or you're just dense, but no one said it's not a spoiler. Just that after a certain time, it's not on the whole world to try to keep things hidden from you. It's been a decade and a half. The assumption is that if you want to avoid spoilers, just be careful and accept that you can't control the world. Calling "wow spoilers!" is self centered and implied anyone gives a shit or should have acted differently.
---
Epitome of trash. 
---
Howdy,
---
I've been watching videos and calculating talents and I'm looking for more input on this decision.
---
PvE - All three appear to provide simplicity and ability to solo some content. I don't care about difficulty levelling, and I like all three lore-wise. I have minimal raiding exp. but I am very good in PvP and would like to conquer PvE, although I will have minimal time for consumables, so I expect a casual guild and little gear.
---
PvP - All seem fast-paced because of their simplicity - HPal constantly changing Auras and Seals and Dispelling, Rogue struggling to stay behind target while CCing others, Warrior charging in and out of front line (stance-dancing appears most complex of the three).
---
Doubts - I don't know to what extent Rogues can solo PvE, to what extent I can PvP as Holy without incessantly monitoring Health and Debuff bars, and to what extent I can rely on teammates as a Warrior. I prefer the dynamics of group play, even when considering Rogue. My preliminary PvP talent builds may be illustrative:
---
[Human Rogue](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGe0RxzNZZyMcc0hoo)
---
[Dwarf HPal (meant also to PvE)](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgottMtZx)
---
[Nelf Warrior](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxdAio0kE0zVM)
---
While these builds builds may be subpar and tempting to correct, please view them only as representations of my interest / playstyle.
---
Any input you can provide to help me choose, I will put it to full use.
---
Regards,
---
Criminelly
---
Maybe stay off the internet then? Not everything comes with a spoiler or trigger warning. 
---
yeah lol id say even for a group of people who are new to classic it should be cleared in like 20-30 min average. 10 min for a fast group who knows what they're doing
---
Finishing this questline made me feel like I'm actually becoming the real fucking deal in terms of my WoW progress. That was so long ago and I still remember doing that quest so vividly. WoW was mind-blowing back then, really unique gaming experience
---
Convincing new players to jump through that window is just Step 1 convincing them to look thru Golemagg's window later on...
---
You can see Ragnaros, I promise!
---
I played an sl/sl lock in TBC I know all about pillar humping =)
---
Seriously.  The water one is like 8 parts, having to travel between the continents and then this dude is like "a'ight you cool.  Here's air."
---
Click it again.  
---
Consider the following: 
---
Quick lose in AV as a solo queuer vs dodging premade is about 4k honor and a mark in 10 minutes or even less. 
---
1h long AV win is about 8-10k honor. 
---
If I am about to rank casually and efficiently then I would take quick losses vs premade  over long tryhard pug vs pug win any day. I just want to reach my goals asap, so nothing personal
---
Oh!  I have that book, still.   It’s falling apart. LOL  
---
Nope
---
Patch 1.3.0 
---
03-07-2005
---
wowwiki
---
Dungeon Player Caps
---
All dungeons now have a cap on group size to limit the number of players that may enter the dungeon. It was necessary to add this cap as raiding these dungeons trivialized much of the content. Because of this change we can now look to adding better loot to them during future content patches.
---
With that in mind, the dungeons below now have the following caps:
---
Onyxia/Molten Core - 40 members
---
Blackrock Spire - 15 members
---
Diremaul - 5 members 
---
All other dungeons in the game will be capped at 10 members.Several dungeons will be re-examined for balancing in light of thischange. In addition, will have their loot improved significatnly forthe next content patch.
---
Patch 1.10.0
---
03-28-2006
---
High-Level Instance Changes
---
Along with the new Armor Sets, the high-level 5-10 man dungeons have received some changes regarding loot. Many items have been improved in quality and use. In addition, several epic items, such as Headmaster's Charge and the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare, have had their drop rates significantly increased. In order to preserve the challenge of these dungeons, they have had their instance caps lowered. Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Depths now allow a maximum of five players inside, and Blackrock Spire allows a maximum of ten.
---
Now it's only the raids.  No dungeons.
---
Spoiler is always a spoiler if you know the specific person doesn't know about it. Like if we are talking about your friend, relative, etc.  
---
But when it comes to social media - people usually give it from a month up to 10 years (just imagine relevant memes to appear 10 years later). We have 15.
---
I agree on what I want to look at.  I don't like how bulky the Tauren are and sometimes looks weird with the gear - orcs win here.  Personally, I like leveling in Mulgore than the red hell of Durotar, less players in the zone and more tranquil. 
---
If you decide to play PvP as Enh, I think Orc is the play.  Axe spec, bloodfury and stun resist make that combo pretty nice.  You could make a case for Tauren since you'll have more HP,  Warstomp and will be in melee range fighting players - making it easier to get a heal off or counter, etc.
---
where did the other class land on your analysis? 
---
People don’t want broken tooth for higher dps. They want him because higher attack speed interrupts casting better than slower which helps in pvp.
---
I'm glad I wasn't the only monster who made new raid members do this: "to pick up a special questline"
---
To this day, I make a point to do the quest to unlock the window entry on any character who needs to go to MC.
---
Yeah, earth, fire and water were cool and were increasingly more difficult (as it is supposed to be) with even a sort of mini boss you had  to fight. And the last one is literally just "talk to this dude". They deff ran out of ideas/time.

Well it IS a pretty huge spoiler for one of the most centerpiece questlines for the entire faction. And I guess there's a lot of people in this sub that played Vanilla and maybe want to switch factions this time around. The only self centered behavior here is from people that know what happens in the q and believe they can freely throw around information about epic endgame plot-twists because everybody "should know by now". It's not your place to decide what people should or want to know. If it's something as big as this it, should still be done with spoiler warnings. 
---
creates a different WoW atmosphere which i find very appealing. i like where this is going. listening to your yt channel right now ...
---
How did people know to jump through the window?  I only knew because people told me to do it.
---
Wikia is now Fandom. Wowwiki is not gone it's just http://wowwiki.fandom.com/ now.
---
I'm in the same boat, can't decide between Tauren/Orc.  What decision criteria have you stuck?  Aesthetically I think Orcs look better with gear and mount, fits the lore as well.  Tauren, however, has a higher skill cap with Warstomp and I think provides a bit more versatility than Orc.  Not sure if that helps narrow it down for you but it certainly made it harder for me.  
---
Originally I was dead set Tauren, but I'm slowly leaning Orc.
---
What happened to "retadin"?
---
Yeah I'm thinking if I roll a warrior I will also roll a hunter alt at the same time.  If I get burned out or need to let some rest exp accumulate I'll just jump on the hunter.
---
Yup, most people who think about this stuff agree that there’s no reason an expac HAS to raise level caps. And obviously any changes should t make the entire original game irrelevant!
---
But TBC is what TBC is, there’s no reason to try and wish for a revamped version of it. IF Blizz ever makes additions to the game, I think they would have to stand alone as their own thing. (Ideal: Same lvl cap with some new raids, battlegrounds, quests, maybe some minor balance or talent tweaks)
---
Basically it goes like this: 
---
1) Hey Blackrock are up to something in Blackrock mountains. go kill some important people and find documents. 
---
2) Shenanigans are afoot... Go talk to people (eventually Thrall)
---
3) Hmm shenanigans ARE afoot, go kill Rend Blackhand
---
4) Thrall: "My spies say Black dragons are behind this and they have been up to no good within the alliance, turns out Onyxia was working to destroy her from within. Now she moved right next door, sorry dont want her there so we should kill her. Go talk to Rexxar he knows how to sneak into the Black Dragon flights lair"
---
5) Rexxar: "You need magic illusions, go talk to this crazy hag about it"
---
6) Old hag: "I need dragon eyes to help you, go to UBRS and get me some"
---
7) Old hag: "Here is a disguise, go talk to Emberstrife (Black Dragon) and he will test you to see if you are worthy to join the black dragon flight elites!"
---
8) Emberstrife: "Go kill champions of each flight!" 
---
9) Emberstrife: "Good job! heres an amulet showing you are an elite!"
---
10) Back to Rexxar: "Good job! Now we need a generals blood and you can go in and kill Onyxia! Go to UBRS and kill last boss now!"
---
11) Returns to Rexxar: "Good job, now you can enter Onyxia's lair!"
---
So in a nutshell, you go into Blackrock mountains because the horde dont like the blackrock, you find some documents. Thrall lets you know Onyxia is a thing and he doesnt want her living so close to Orgrimmar (LEGITIMATELY THAT IS THE REASON HE WANTS HER DEAD). You go finish the attunement chain and dont really get a quest to kill her. It's just implied that your warchief would really like someone to take care of her.
---
There was no story for horde, we killed her just because, then you stuck her jead on a big pike in org.
---
I played orc warrior from 2004 through every xpack. Unfortunately, i was 12 years old in 2004 and very stupid. So now, i will return to my warrior and achieve the goals i wanted to back then
---
can trolls even be warlocks?
---
They were told to do it.
---
Reminds me of kiting big world bosses to og
---
I am only here to collect his body.
---
&gt;Just that after a certain time, it's not on the whole world to try to keep things hidden from you.
---
But why? I just don't understand how people think it's fine to spoil things or make no effort to prevent someone from being spoiled just because some time has passed. It's just common courtesy in my eyes.
---
Night elf rogue. I know a short cut to IF too when I’m ready to go to westfall. Just gotta grab the wetlands fp then skip running through the wetlands.
---
I believe I did, SM/Ruin is great in 1v1s, premades, and BGs like I stated.  Added additional information in support of SM Ruin, why I think its superior compared to other specs, added perks of this spec for raiding, and why it was fun.  Closing it off with my experience playing a warlock in vanilla so its a fairly reputable source for first hand knowledge
---
Either an Orc Warrior to fury dps at 60 and Forsaken Priest to holy/disc heal at 60
---
Or
---
Human Warrior for the same role and Human Holydin at 60 or Dorf priest with the same spec and role.
---
I haven't locked down on a faction yet.
---
So everyone should avoid discussing anything that  could possibly spoil any storyline of anything for anyone in a discussion?
---
Completely reasonable... Lol
---
Played on Medivh (first server to hit gong) and the server crashes before during and after the event just made it that more epic. You couldn't ride boats without them bugging out/crashing and ending up in fatigue water and countless lvl 1s drowning. 
---
Then they released some of the Anubis looking dog bosses to stomp out all the other level 1s camping the gates. Then when it actually happens, world defense is going off countless zones as the entirety of Azeroth was under attack by boss elites. 
---
Gather up my guildies and went to Feralas and managed to get a bunch of random boe loot and gold. Can't say I ever remember a single envwnt in any game coming close to the scope of this.
---
Then to finalize it, seeing Kalahad on the legendary bug mount and everyone spamming trade and other channels linking it. No one (non blizz employee) knew this existed until that very moment. 
---
So fucking epic
---
My favourite bit of dialogue comes from that quest, where bolvar tells you to ask her something, so you do and she snaps back 'yes I heard, im standing right here you imbicile'
---
Higher skill cap only means that a very skilled player will do much better than other people who play the same class, it has nothing at all to do with other classes.  A mage had a pretty low skill cap by comparison and it was very strong.
---
To say that's the only self centered behavior is delusional and obviously wrong. Wanting people to act a certain way for your benefit is categorically self centered.
---
I just want to make sure you know that duel spec isn't a thing. So its Prot vs Arms. Gold respecing caps at 50g, but 50g is alot.
---
No.
---
If it seems like your preferred spec to play don't let anyone stop you. Casters will love your power infusion. If you don't want to play deep holy no one is forcing you too. Just don't go NElf if you're Alliance ;)
---
Spoiler alert: Dumbledore dies
---
There are two main ways to progress your character:
---
1) Leveling up, done by questing and killing enemies, which grants you some stats and talent points
---
2) Acquiring gear, done by basically everything.
---
Acquiring gear reaches a point where it becomes gated and unlocks at your ability to acquire the gear needed to do it.  
---
The reason the old content is obsoleted is because levels 60-70 are available to everyone immediately.
---
If WoW had gatekeeping system on unlocking higher levels, it would require that level 60 content stay relevant even after level 70 is available.
---
To reach level 61, you need to first have level 61 unlocked.  You can do this by:  1) completing a very long, complex world quest full of challenging level 60 content that requires lots of traveling, acquiring resources, etc, e.g., kind of like the tier 0.5 quest line, or the AQ scepter quest (minus the raid content).  2) reaching some major PvP milestones, e.g. revered with 3 battleground factions and at least x number of HK's, 3) completing some raid quests that aren't easily sellable in a single run.
---
Those are off-the-cuff examples.  It wouldn't be easy to make all 3 of those paths have equal time/effort commitments, but you get the gist.
---
You want to unlock level 62?  Maybe you have to now complete the epic Karazhan story quest, or clear Karazhan, etc.  You work your way up.
---
This wasn't easily possible in vanilla days, but now that they have scaling tech.  If you are trying to boost someone through level 60 content on your 70, you get bumped down to level 60 scale.  The talent points you spent after 60 are removed.  Level 61+ on-use effects are disabled, etc.
---
*vociferous*
---
Learned a word today thanks
---
I wanted to be a Human Hunter, but than realized those didn't exist yet so I decided to go with a Dwarf.
---
I think the important thing to keep in mind for Classic is that not all classes/specs are created equal. It's not like Wrath or even BC where every spec has a good shot at a raid slot. Some are explicitly worse and will require much more effort to get the same results out of.
---
That's not to say that every druid/paladin/priest/shaman has to heal, warrior tanks only, all that mess. Just know that if you're playing a suboptimal spec, you're going to have to work twice as hard for half the reward.
---
So consider what you want to do at endgame and how hard you want to work for it. If you want to play a suboptimal spec, decide ahead of time if you're going to tryhard to make up the differential or if you're okay with falling behind the players who chose easier, more effective options.
---
One of the best things, imo, with these quest chains is that almost everyone "had to" do them. 
---
The ony chain is 100% required if you want to do ony - no "my friend has the key so I don't need it", no microtransactions, no nothing. You just have to get through the fucking chain if you want to do ony. 
---
And if you want the best gear, you're 100% required to do the Tirion chain too (unless you're a mage or lock). The healer ring doesn't get replaced until Nefarian/ZG so it's gonna last you through a huge part of your raiding career. MDPS neck and tank chest are a bit weaker, but still pre-MC BiS. 
---
The chains are definitely a time-sink and a struggle, but the rewards (and the journey there) are equally unmatched. 
---
Say it louder for the people in the back. Couldn’t agree more. People who want different things for vanilla don’t want vanilla. 
---
If you’re only into PvP, my vote would go towards Shadow Priest. However, if you aren’t 100% married to the idea of being a Troll, I’d say Undead should always be a contender. Will of the Forsaken is insane, canalize is great for a mana-less heal, and Devouring Plague is devastating, from what I remember, and it gives an extra opportunity to Proc Blackout to gain distance.
---
But, overall vote goes to Spriest. Race is up to your personal preference over min-maxing. 
---
Yea I do, I just mention PvE specs because I am interested in them as well, but not doubtful like I am about PvP.
---
I am so happy to see you posting in this sub. Big fan of your work in HoTS. Hope you are as excited for Classic as I am. 
---
2meirl4meirl
---
My long term goal is to do the raids i enjoyed in the past and some i missed when i stopped playing at the beginning of Wrath do to simply working at Mythic and CRS for Warhammer.
---
I would prefer a cycle of Vanillia TBC Wrath if for no other reason than we know what to expect with whats there. I am far more fearful of new things from blizzard. I would also say that Fresh needs to be part of this cycle as well.
---
I keep saying it, but the #nochanges movement wants to play on Kirkland monitors too. Can't wait for the release with small quality of life changes and the crying that will ensue. 
---
Ikr. I can’t wait to get classic and all these people who want retail start crying because they were wrong.
---
Yeah you gotta do the full attunement quest to go to MC on retail servers, unlike private servers where you don’t lol. Same with onyxia.
---
Please quote where I said that, I must be missing it.
---
It was even better when you summoned her right as a Horde raid group came in.
---
Yeah it's usually one of the first actually useful trinkets you come across. And at 60, it's one of very few ways to boost your mount speed (boot spikes and glove enchant being the others).
---
It’s almost like that’s what happens when you listen to the vocal minority whose opinions don’t reflect the rest of the majority player base. 
---
Alliance scum 
---
Alright so first i love world pvp so choosing server was easy.
---
Second i like being a dps more then tank/healer. I recently played hunter but i like playing a more outplay potential class, like rogue/mage. Also currently lvling a shadow priest, while it's not as bad as i thought, i hate that i have no movement/catch up/slows etc, so i don't want a class similar to that. 
---
I go decided rogue/mage since i love world pvp/outplay potential it has. 
---
In the end i go for rogue on my main, since i love being able to go stealth and gank too.
---
Second char will be a mage.
---
Race is the only thing i have undecided, but still feel 90% sure it's going to be Orc, the other 10% is at undead.
---
Orc is better for PVP/PVE honestly + i like durotar more actually, meanwhile i feel like rogue doesn't suit Orc and undead suits rogue much better, which is why i still consider undead a bit.
---
Profession: First aid for leveling oboiusly, will also go enchanting is "for sure", i'm like 90% sure i will go skinning, because it's a profession i can eaisly delete to go for eng later. That way i can early farm devil saur for gold and then later earn my money on enchanting (hopefully). 
---
PSA for people who have played WoW; be CAREFUL to try and not spoil this if you can.  There are people coming in who have never played and this is going to be one of the coolest Oh Shit moments.
---
There are a lot of things that vanilla world PvP is but one thing it isn't is balanced. It's not like war mode in retail where Blizzard try to police it with buffs and an opt in/out for people who don't want to fight. It's the wild west out there, everybody is flagged in contested and hostile territory; everybody on the server is at war. Nowhere is safe and it's glorious. 
---
Some might view random fights in the world as an inconvenient set back to their plans, I view it as an opportunity to have fun. I'm not playing the game to meet a levelling/farming quota - you've got all the time in the world for that. 
---
World PvP will make every trip out into the world feel like a real adventure. The unpredictability of who will be around the next corner adds so much to the feeling of ever present danger. The cities and hubs feel all the more safe and like home when the regions outside are so fraught with the possibility of death. There's also the possibility of inflicting death, there's nothing like stalking a real person through the open world and killing him or getting the best of someone who thought you were easy prey. There's nothing like seeing a sea of red over the horizon and putting in the call to arms through your /1, /g and friends list. The battles between Tarren Mill and Southshore, the killing grounds of STV(ietnam), raiding Stormwind with 100+ others. It's so epic and I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
---
Good luck finding the missing guards in Elwynn without help. I remember having to look it up on Allakhazam back in the day, but this time around I'm all for the immersion and the experience.
---
Damn. I've been Horde Only since Vanilla, and never got to raid much further than Molten Core, I had no idea the Onyxia storyline was so involved lore-wise.
---
Get over yourself Kodalaken.
---
Your presence will be missed
---
Idr, is there a canonical reason the window becomes a portal? It's such a strange mechanic to just... suddenly exist.
---
15 years is not “some time” it’s more than a decade old
---
My guess is that in the early days of WoW some sort of work around was used to have a teleport spell work with an NPC. An "invisible" instance portal was placed just outside the window by this NPC so that it would work. Why else would that be there randomly? Some guy probably was just goofing around and jumped out the window or got knocked off during WPvP and was greeted with an MC loading screen. Then the information spread like wildfire. 
---
Fuck
---
I still find it a bit funny that the box included that dragon fighting a demon hunter in Zul’Gurub.
---
&gt;Come on, there were pure catch up mechanics, just not as deadly - old raids would still matter a lot. Legendaries, unique items, etc. Even after dire maul and zul'gurub.
---
Were they real catch up mechnics though? Were looking at the ability to skip entier raids in current game. ZG might have helped you get into MC and BWL more easily but its nothing like what they do today. I could easily see blizzard saying. Post Naxx Raid catch up is going to put you in a postion to Skip Naxx and join in with everyone else.
---
This all goes back to the same point i tried to make a number of times. I do not have faith in blizzard not to mess up ANY new content in WoW. Classic or otherwise. If the goal of the overall wow team is acessability, why would that suddenly stop at Classic?
---
Me as well, though I can live with low polygons and textures if I have to.
---
It would have been spoiled anyway if you played hunter amd had track dragonkin active. She shows up on the minimap
---
I can agree with this.
---
Best comment on Reddit today.
---
This is easily spoiled if you are a hunter and happen to be tracking Dragonkin. She shows up on the minimap, which has always been one of my favorite easter eggs.
---
So made up numbers based on your own anecdotal evidence? Clearly it was an issue, and they saw it becoming an issue again or they would not be doing this. They don't want to pay GM's to deal with it, and it did happen quite frequently. 
---
This is not an ideal solution, but it requires no dev time, is already in the game they are building off of, and had very few issues when implemented (When implemented the loot system was functionally the same as classic). This nonsense that acts like the sky is falling is too much, the problems you are imagining will stay imaginary for the most part.
---
But they will not be paying an army of GM's to deal with classic, so that is out. Also just saying "We won't fix loot problems" runs into too many issues. They have fixed these issues from day one, and to stop now would be a slap in the face. Plus they would still be overloaded with tickets about it, no matter how many times they say they won't help and GM's still have to wade through those tickets.
---
Rogue is probably the most popular class, however I raided through vanilla and bc no issues 
---
Human Warrior
---
Human due to the balanced base Stats
---
Warrior due to I've been a warrior since vanilla and want to get back to that.
---
Would have picked night elf due to the extra dodge chance, crit chance, armour and stealth for when I go for a smoko, but chose human due to more balance.
---
You can still do this on live servers. Just fly into the area  to the left of the little room with the NPC. You will get teleported to MC.
---
So your argument boils down to “people will be good and won’t abuse the system.” Seriously? And all the obvious bad things won’t happen just because you say so. Ok.
---
Loot sales will be common and everyone will be doing it. Moreover, as I pointed out in my last post, you can argue people have a RIGHT under loot trading to roll on upgrades and choose to sell them to others. If I have the right to do something how does that tarnish my reputation? How will that make someone an asshole? 
---
If you say that then you also need to say they don’t have a right to vendor or disenchant their gear as they see fit. Once you win something you were entitled to roll on you either own it or you don’t. If you own it you can choose to sell it. 
---
Thanks for the good summary, definitely not as cool of a quest line!
---
I’m not 100% decided, so I may not be able to help too much.  But I will say that I’m heavy into the warrior for every expansion, every role, and every spec.
---
My thoughts would be that a warrior would give the ultimate reward at max level with gear.  You could tank, do too DPS, and you could PvP pretty hard.
---
My only downsides would be gold farming and reliance on teammates which doesn’t seem to be too much of an issue if you’re focused on group PvP.
---
In short, I always recommend warrior because I’m biased.  Hopefully my 2 cents gives some of my minuscule insight.
---
NOTE: PvP server leveling suuuuucks!  You’ll die SO many times.  So if you like that struggle, you’ll love a PvP server for leveling.
---
If they don't add Ultra HD and modern ragdoll physics there is no way I'm playing this boring shitty old game, and no one else will either.
---
Oh Im definitely making an alt. Those demons for your bow and staff were the greatest experiences Ive had in an MMO. No way Im missing out on that. But I was disappointed at getting benched for some progression fights in Naxx. They made me bring in my mage because we needed better sustained dps and my Hunter couldnt outdo my mage at all. I hated it.
---
Black male human rogue with the name Fruitckae, need to tell more?
---
No. Warriors are much better with a healer than most classes. They go from okay in PvP to undeniably the strongest. Sure every class is good with a healer but not on the same level as warriors. If there was 2v2 arena in Vanilla, warrior+pala would likely dominate.  You can't have a pvp "Best Race/Class" List without considering how they interact with other allied classes.  Unless you want to restrict this to best Race/Class in duels or 1v1.
---
I am not trying to put warrior high up just because they are good with a healer. I am saying that Orc isn't clearly the best no matter what as you are claiming. You keep considering the enemy matchups you will face if you are alliance as arguments against them, but refuse to allow us to consider the difference in our allies?  
---
Your argument against gnome is that their cc is weak against orcs and undeads. That there are so many undead mages and that they will eat you for breakfast. But you ignore Blessing of Freedom, which is a much better tool against a mage than fear or intercept stun. Freedom warrior and hamstring is godly in WSG. Would you rather be gnome warrior / pala vs UD mage + 1 other class or would you rather be orc warrior / shammy vs mage + 1 other class? I'd probably take the gnome.   
---
I would say that if we are going for "overall" the best,, gnome warrior is better. Gnome racial helps more with the classes that beat you in 1v1 and in a group situation they come out on top because of blessing of freedom. 
---
Just experimenting around but I'm working on some stuff similar to that song right now actually. Thanks for checking out the music, my man.
---
Both images are the same.
---
&gt; Won't we get to a point where I'm 5 raids above Naxx, yet my armor is arguably not too far off AQ40 gear?
---
Right now the big issue is that most raid rewards are just "bigger numbers". So if bigger numbers no longer becomes a viable option there's currently no alternative reward type to replace them with. The developers would have to completely redesign what "progression" means for WoW.
---
Mind if I PM you? I'd like to talk about those things because it'd be great stuff for content later on
---
Oh really? why's that? if you don't mind explaining
---
I agree with a lot of yours, but here is my full rundown.
---
**Orc:** 
---
* Better looking
---
* Better Mounts
---
* 25% Stun Resist
---
**Tauren**:
---
* War stomp 
---
* Health Increase
---
* Con: Awful mounts
---
It mainly comes down to the **War stomp** and **Health increase** vs. **stun resist**.
---
I don't care about leveling or anything like that.  I barely remember leveling to 60, I remember game play after 60 the most. 
---
much love my man! I'm glad you're digging it, and thank you very much for checking out my channel!
---
Supposedly they were 666 yards away from Stormwind.
---
[Here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8c0t4b/cutunfinished_content/)
---
Question, are you including non-Classic cut content? If not, do you have more information on the Deathwing Scar in relation to vanilla because this is the first I'm hearing of it. 
---
The pay they offer is not comparable with the cost of living.  Most of the lower-level employees were basically either living in their cars or living in large groups in order to make ends meet.
---
They're getting to the point where employees are leaving in droves.

I can tell you, that something like PF quest will ALWAYS help you, it says exact spawn points, so if you have 14x spawns of stranglethorn tigers u need to kill, u will see a dot of all 14 of them on the map, the reason this helps you is because often 3-4 of them are never contested because they aren't near the others or similar. U can also go between each EXACT respawn and not just estimated area, this quest addon helps so much. Currently i'm doing a "no quest addon to 60" i'm i have lvled a lot too and know all the quests (atleast up to lvl 35) of course once in a while u need to read the quest real quick to remember exactly where to go, where suddently u remember "ahh it's that one where u have to pick up that in that area" i did forget 1 quest once on my route where i had to walk all the way back in desolace (currenty location). But PF quest stilll helps me so much with respawns, even more on stealth mobs, like in ashenvale Alliance ones, u just see exactly where they are on the map.

it says no longer persists through death in 1.11?
---
I still plan to ask each patch if Ony is deep breathing more. 
---
The tradition most continue.
---
I heard the questline was going away in a patch and I had never done it, so I banged out the quest line until the last step. I let my guild know and on the night before the patch dropped, my whole guild marched with me up to the castle and we finished it together.
---
I logged in the next day and everything had changed. It was one of those few experiences before they introduced phasing that I did something that had a lasting effect on the world.
---
Best of all, when I got to Northrend there was a quest where Bolvar came to my aid, saying he remembered what I did for him in Stormwind. He only said that line on my character that completed that quest line. It gave me chills.
---
Well, here's a patch note from 1.3
---
* Patch 1.3
---
 * Players who have completed the Molten Core discovery quest can now port directly to the zone, bypassing Blackrock Depths.
---
Before that, it sounds like you had to go to BRD in order to get in the instance, at least I'm assuming that based on this note from patch 1.2
---
&gt;If you die in Molten Core, you will now be able to retrieve your corpse at the Blackrock Depths instance line.

---
So do that? 
---
Nobody gives a fuck if you are being efficient in your honor/hour other than you. 
---
Anyone with interest in Alliance lore knows that Katrana Prestor was in fact Onyxia and that she was behind Varian´s disappearance and her actions resulted in creation of Defias.
---
The fact that you see this revelation as a spoiler means you weren´t interested enough to learn about basic Alliance WoW lore.
---
Interesting that King B does more, think his attack speed is 2.0?  
---
I agree there is a difference, like the difference between a Gnome and Human mage.
---
I remember how nervous I was the first time I did this, I thought my guild mates were trying to pull a prank on me, so as a rogue I stealthed in the death trap that is BRM right next to this portal and waited for someone else to go through it first. Sure enough they disappeared and I followed after!
---
Also (if I understood it correctly), every time someone does the quest, others who are in Stormwind Keep see it. So you could theoretically be level 10 and see Katrana turn into Onyxia.
---
I'm basically trying to "right" all the "wrongs" that 15 year old me made playing a rogue, and actually get to Naxx this time around (and clear past Princess H in AQ40). 
---
In addition to that, I just love the rogue class. 
---
Hunters were at their best in classic overall, pvp and pve as a whole. 
---
Hunter class today is garbage. They gutted everything fun.
---
Exactly, PvP pushback the only benefit of BT.
---
I think they just rez out near the big cemetary, a long run from the Alliance town.
---
There won't be any PVP honor system, BGs and respective rewards  until the second (BWL + ZG) content patch, so your plan is wrong from the very beginning.
---
MM Hunters, Holy Palas work nicely in both PvE and PvP, Warlocks and Priests can perform decently in both specs. 
---
2H Furies, rogues and shamans can be fine as well assuming you got some OP power spike pieces of gear like BRE and so on.
---
My first character will be leveled without QH, whereas subsequent characters will use QH. I might mix it up and when I come to level a character of the opposing faction I avoid using addons just to experience their side of leveling.
---
Ah yes, you're right. I forgot about trading between games. Hopefully the majority of players do not do this!
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_byHjhTzfSg) is what they had in the files before TBC. 
---
Wait are you actually saying that warrior is the worst class in PvP overall? 
---
If you get max level on any class within first 3 months of release it’s easy to find a guild. 
---
Guilds become harder to find post-bwl.
---
You are impling that people should not discuss core aspects of storylines that are 15+ years old because it might "spoil" it for anyone reading.
---
That is ridiculous to the point that I think you might be trolling.
---
14 years of playing off and on and I've never fully watched this RP event... Or just about anyone of them.
---
The invisible bunnies were for targeting her fire balls while she flew
---
Troll shadowguard is just so damn tantalizing. Even going PvP disc I would get blackout for it
---
well shit, noted. I'll look for different companies to submit stuff to haha..
---
Yeah agreed with your criteria.  I'm very on the fence and have a feeling it'll come down to Loading Screen like user @zakaun mentioned.  Have you watched any YT videos from pservers or back in Vanilla that are swaying you one way or the other? Which way do you currently lean?
---
I've seen pserver videos of both Orc and Tauren and honestly still hasn't helped.  It's funny, I think if you were to play Enh, you'd have an even harder time deciding... Tauren hitbox range with HP and Warstomp vs Orc Stun Resist  Bloodfury and Axe Passive could easily go both ways.  
---
Just like everybody else, I’m playing the same thing I was playing in vanilla, undead warlock. I’m really excited because back then I was shit and had no idea what I was doing, and now that I’m much better, I can actually experience past level 24
---
Wizards101. There were over a thousand items, furniture, and the houses were absolutely insane. Some were under water with the stairways flooding. You could place the items anywhere and interact with most, like jail cages, candles, etc. it was honestly more customizable interiors than the sims 
---
Does the majority of PvP happen in 1v1 world PvP or in duels? No. It happens in BG's. But honestly 1v1 and in a group is so different it feels stupid to lump them together.   
---
In 1v1 warriors are still gods if they just pop a FAP. 
---
I completely agree.  I'll keep going back and forth after watching different pvp videos until classic releases.  
---
I have to create my character quick because my name was pretty hard to get in vanilla and I want the same one. 
---
I'm unsure about how PvP servers are going to go when classic goes live. Back in the old days, people were a more ignorant in general about how to play well and many people were just getting into MMORPGs for the first time, so even on PvP servers, plenty of people were just around to enjoy the ride.
---
My concern with classic is that more people on PvP servers will be focused on building out characters specifically to gank and troll people constantly rather than just being a side objective for playing the game. And on a related note, I wonder how many people are going to avoid PvP servers knowing how annoying things like high level ganks and camping can be at time.
---
This could mean that the PvP servers are filled with rogues and gank squads but not enough "victims" to go around, meaning the people who are there not just to play on a PvP server are going to have a much worse experience than they would have had in the vanilla days.
---
You'll probably want to PvE and PvP on the same character.
---
Classic isn't like the rest of the WoW patches. There isn't that PvP/PvE divide.
---
There are many items from PvE content that you'll want for PvPing.
---
Rather than having a character for PvP and one for PvE, you'd probably be better off having one as a main and one as a gold farmer (if your main can't farm gold well).    
---
So you can pay for all the respecs if you find yourself in trying to rank while also raiding.
---
Funny thing is this is identical to pservers' world chat. The only difference is the name. Both are opt-in. It's deactivated by default, and you need to type /join world to join it.
---
&gt;Diablo drama, hots dying, retail wow sucking, hearthstone. I even hate overwatch. It doesn't seem like the same company that I've been following since rocknroll racing on sega.
---
Diablo drama is self inflicted by the fans. Everyone who's played it has reported it's in okay mobile game. Plus we know they are working on Diablo 4. Were they out of touch with how they presented it? Probably, but that doesn't mean that the series is going to die...
---
Hots was never an amazing game. it was blizzards attempt to get into a market that they were already behind on. It clearly wasn't catching on in a big way. Exiting the competitive market makes sense from a business point. It will allow them to put those funds into developing new games.
---
Retail wow has sucked for a decade now. This isn't a new development.
---
Hearthstone is in a great spot right now, and still dominates the mobile trading card game market. OverWatch is still going strong and has a huge fan base. Just because you don't like the game doesn't mean that blizzard messed up.
---
Vanilla had a global LFG channel.
---
Posting to agree. If anything, SM/Ruin is THE battleground / premade spec.   
---
A warlocks role is control and ranged burst.  
---
Soul link can't burst, it's damage output is the lowest by far of the specs. It's a 1v1 spec. Using it in group PvP is wasting half of your warlocks potential. The only argument for it's use could be defending an AB node - but usually this is assigned to other classes as you want your lock in the team fights. If a lock is assigned a node to defend it is one of the forward bases - which is irrelevant if you don't win them in the first place.  
---
Conflagrate is more competitive as it can still burst, but ultimately SM / Ruin is the highest damage spec as SM increases your shadowbolt / shadowburn damage. Crit shadowbolt + shadowburn just globals people, which is half of your job as a Warlock. You also keep the most powerful dots and more control options.   
---
Honestly the only battleground that spec could even be debated is AB. AV is basically PvE and if you wanted to optimise you would probably go a full PvE spec, but SM/Ruin is the best of the PvP options. For WSG you want Curse of Exhaustion. An instant cast, ranged, spammable snare is invaluable in a battleground based on mobility and this spell wins games on it's own. You can slow whole groups of players or spam it on the enemy druid, wasting their mana quickly as they shift. If the opposing team are decursing, they aren't doing more useful things, like spamming R1 Frostbolt on your group.   
---
I don't know much about Paladins. I've seen Paladins 1 shot people all the time, assuming they're reck bombing. What is this thing, how does it work?
---
And then you hearthstone to Kargath with your whole raid buffed to go try and get that fucking Ragnaros first. Good old days. 
---
Haha I gotchu. Lmk what you decide!
---
&gt;The Molten Core
---
&gt;Time to Complete: 4-12 hours (1-3 days)
---
Oh how things have changed.
---
Hey man, are you making a guild for classic or currently just a pserver? I’m already now lookin’ around for a community - gotta be EU though :) 
---
Are you talking about 10 years ago or now? I'm talking about today. I'm talking about why people still play Classic instead of all the other expansions.
---
One thing I didn't like about Outland was just how disconnected it was from the old world. The Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor may have been different continents but there were 5 ways to travel between them: one neutral boat, two Alliance boats, and two Horde zeppelins. What did Outland have? A single portal to the Eastern Kingdoms and nothing to Kalimdor.
---
I can understand having just the one portal at the start of the expansion but let us unlock more along the way! For example, during Zangermarsh questing we could find that the Naga have made a portal between there and Azshara. This would give us a second way to get between Outland and Azeroth. If you want new content to feel like it's not replacing old content a bad way to go about it is by making the new stuff feel all but completely separate from the old.
---
This is a big reason why the Emerald Dream is near the top of my list when it comes to new zones. There are already at least four ways set forth to physically enter the Dream and who knows how many ways to enter in your dreams.
---
His eyes look like soulstones...
---
Woah buddy 😮
---
Yes. PVP servers are for people who worry about getting bored at max level and want the option to set up at a low-level quest hub to make others miserable for little effort. You can have all the mutually-consensual PVP you want in battlegrounds. The one thing you can't get in a BG though is twisted joy from the belief/hope that you're making another person unhappy. What most people do on PVP servers, if it were publicly known and linked to their RL name, they would be embarrassed.
---
Ghostery mobile browser. Problem solved.
---
For leveling as a warrior I'd personally go min/eng according to ur points. 
---
BS is quite resource heavy from early on (so, expect long farming time or spend gold in AH, gold you'd better save for mount and possibly some gear) and provides very little (early on it's mostly enchanting rods that sell well) until very late. As perks you get a trinket ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=10418](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10418)) offering 30 sec fear inmunity... but hey, you already have recklessness, berserker rage and maybe death wish (if spec'd) to escape it.
---
Eng, on the other side, will be helpful regardless of PvE or PvE content. Nades/bombs for AoE pulling, trinkets summoning help (mech dragonling, mithril/arcanite ones, harvest reaper), and anti caster stuff (ice/fire deflectors early on, endgame with the ice/fire/shadow reflector trinkets). It's still costly but more manageable.  
---
Personally I'd go gnomish due to the chicken trinket, handy for PvE. The actual winners can be used by either spec even if some are crafted by only one of them (rocket helm, reflectors, shield, net launcher, sappers...).
---
If u had to go BS (flavor or just interested in it) go armorsmith. Weaponsmithing brings little, mainly the nightfall axe (and it's a BoE anyway) if axesmith. Sword/mace bring little, maybe sageblade for sword crafters depending on when it is released (since on pservers the recipe is added so late it has little relevance, if on classic it's there from the start... might be a thing). And even then, it would be better to get a mining alt (seeing you're open to it) and end up BS/Eng scrapping mining on ur main IMO.    
---
Race-wise PvE human trumps everything else due to +skill (more damage, but also more threat if tanking). PvP is a toss between gnomes and dwarves. Shadowmeld is handy for open world stuff (mostly setting ambushes or avoiding gankers) and leveling, but is arguably the weakest race. Just personal preference depending on ur focus.  
---
Putress was such a badass, I was pretty bummed he got killed off in the expansion. 
---
“Did you think we had forgotten? Did you think we had forgiven? Behold, now, the terrible vengeance of the Forsaken! Death to the Scourge! And death to the living!”
---
The longer the game runs the bigger the power gap between new and long-standing players. If there are catch-up mechanisms, old school players grizzle about them, if there aren't then new players never catch up. If the players are encouraged to coexist in the same space then newbies are mercilessly ganked, and then quit, or they level up in mostly empty zones. You solve the mostly empty levelling zones problem with crz and accidentally kill server community. There's certainly no easy solution to the problem.
---
Horde/Warlock/Orc
---
I plan to play with a couple of RL Friends.  They want to be horde. So not a paladin. 
---
They are going priest and rouge. priest is going to heal.   I don't even want to be either of those, and I want to optimize loot a bit so avoiding leather/daggers and healing class, so no druid.  Been a warrior and a shaman before, not to keen on my main being one of those again. 
---
Now I am left with Mage, Warlock and Hunter.
---
Of the 3 of us, I am likely to be the one online alone (they are a couple and have the same play times) so a pet would make it easier to do more solo stuff, so Mage is edged out a bit.
---
I hate the arrows and pet food/meat needed for a hunter, so pass...
---
Warlocks and priests is an overlap in gear, so not optimal, but since priest is going to be a herb/alcohol, if I go tailor / enchanting, we both win.
---
Quick review... Is a Warlock better than a Mage?... Portals are handy... But with 2 other players, summoning portal is near instant group summoning to instances...
---
Pet is also handy...
---
How do my tier.5 and tier sets look?   Ok... Tie? How dose my PvP set look?  Warlock wins.
---
Race options... Orc or undead... Hate the tattered effect that happens to armor on undead legs and arms... So Orc.
---
Anyone else actually really appreciate the aesthetic and graphical fidelity of modern wow, as well as the ability to customize your characters look with transmog etc?
---
To me that would be perfect. Almost 100% of classic mechanics + modern wows graphics and appearance customization.
---
What a tedious and childish response. You are clearly implying exactly that. 
---
Wrathgate would like to have a word with you. So would Arthas' death.
---
“How dare you say Bilbo finds the ring. You’re spoiling that 70 year old book for me!”
---
Where do you draw the line?
---
The brd quests were nuts too. 
---
&gt; Not having flying mounts was also CLEARLY a bug since they added that in TBC.
---
Considering the purposefully left Vanilla areas unflyable until Cataclysm, it's something they were fully aware would be a problem until some sort of revamp.
---
Damn dude, how can you get dunked on *so much* in one thread?
---
Never played a healer, which ring is that?
---
Played a hunter since vanilla.
---
[Son, I was wiping on Hogger while you were just an itch in your daddy's pants!](https://i.imgur.com/RybiAXz.jpg)
---
Ah I remember my first time learning about “attunement” 
---
Human Warlock. Human starting zone + intimate knowledge of the 1-40 human level pathing for that FRESH START. Also Warlock because being my first char blaizing a trail of no monies it'll be easier etc.
---
You CAN see him, just need to zoom in to first person :D
---
They could go the other way as well. Say there was a new raid and nearly all its denizens were very weak to Fire. The developers could introduce new melee or ranged weapons that convert some percentage of all the physical damage you deal to Fire. So gearing up for the raid wouldn't just mean being more durable. It would also mean higher dps.
---
&gt; Thrall lets you know Onyxia is a thing and he doesnt want her living so close to Orgrimmar (LEGITIMATELY THAT IS THE REASON HE WANTS HER DEAD).
---
What's wrong with that? An enemy-aligned dragon living a stones throw away might be a problem for your rapidly expanding Horde. That's some cool lore.
---
Oh boy. 
---
I'm set on playing a ranged class. I played a mage on Nost PVE for a while and really enjoyed it, but am considering another class in Classic to really maximize the feeling of newness and discovery. Maybe warlock? Hunter? 
---
Of course, taking things to the extreme no brain would be able to compete with the amount of data that current questhelpers give you. My main point was: for the 95% i wouldn't need it and the RP element of "having to read where to go" doesn't apply to either myself or a huge amount of other players as well.
---
Remember Theramore is still a thing in a vanilla
---
Basically.. sometimes when you were strafing back and forth one of the directions your character would have the animation of walking backwards but at full strafe speed, so it looked like you were moonwalking.  Your character would get stuck doing this for a while but then it would stop and you would be sad :(
---
the reason I never got into pvp while leveling...my poor keyboarding turning hunter in hand-me-down quest greens got absolutely shit on every time I tried battlegrounds
---
You can do both! 
---
Both offer great utility.
---
I main priest and can tell you the leveling experience is quick and easy. Healing is fun and easy to find groups. Shadow is awesome. Disc can be fun with friends. Holy is holy. 
---
You can farm dm east with priest at end game. 
---
You can do alot of what mages can do except aoe very well. Holy nova is fine for farming dm east and that's about it lol.
---
You can heal, which makes cannot. 
---
Both are fun. 
---
I agree with Bendltd - yes you won't be able to raid as moonkin, but play what makes you happy!  Balance spec healing is pretty damn viable in vanilla, so you could still heal runs if you needed to.
---
Love this story!
---
In raids, sure.  Pvp is a completely different story.  
---
You’ll get rep with stormwind
---
Till people need to unlock the door inside dm north then its 10g.
---
Man, I ran so may people through their Ony attunement back in the day..
---
Ok calm down.
---
I suspect you'd get to Honored with Darnassus by 40 anyway. 
---
Lol, coming from someone whose only argument is "people are assholes and everyone will abuse the system".. 
---
&gt; Moreover, as I pointed out in my last post, you can argue people have a RIGHT under loot trading to roll on upgrades and choose to sell them to others.
---
No, you can't argue that. 
---
If you roll on an item it means and communicates to others you need it as a gear upgrade and plan on equipping it. 
---
In a scenario without loot trading how do you think people would react if they knew someone keeps rolling on items that are technically upgrades for him but keeps vendoring them instead? Why should a rare or epic item that could really upgrade someone's gear (and thus be useful in future content) go to the vendor instead? That's just a waste. That's why it would be seen as an equivalent to the good ol' ninja looting. Because making money out of a piece of equipment is literally what the greed roll is for - and nothing else. Someone known to vendor drops he rolls for (instead of equipping them) will eventually not get invited anymore. 
---
Same goes for loot trading and people trying to sell stuff. People will ask why he even rolled on the item if he does not want it as a gear upgrade. And "selling" won't be an acceptable excuse. 
---
&lt;Lady Prestor glares at you.&gt;
---
Sadly, catering to a popular crowd for more sales is what doomed this game (not like I had to say it) and this is the reason why we don't see stuff like this in retail anymore. Blizzard isn't gonna put people through "struggle" for rewards. Instead, daily quests exist in the game with no apparent difficulty to give people the feeling of accomplishment.
---
I still cared about keys even with the key ring. I liked adding keys to it. Each key added was an accomplishment. Some new quest or dungeon complete. I wanted to have all the keys. 
---
Sword rogue or bust. Also, look up oto’s rogue guide.
---
&gt;Much of the database work is done by now from my understanding of the blizcon demo. I'm sure there will be odd items, quests, spawns that need addressing but much of that will be discovered by players on live. Even with a beta, bugs happen in production.
---
You say this as if the number of bugs in the demo was in any way acceptable for a production stage. Clearly, just fixing the database links is in no way adequate, as there is a great deal of other mechanics that need to be adjusted in order to produce the expected behaviour.
---
A lot of people in this thread seem to be overly concerned about players experiencing the beta and peacing out before even subbing a month. First, you don't need to be concerned over that as the customer. Be selfish. Second, a closed beta will hardly have much effect on that, and can in fact merely serve to generate a massive amount of hype, especially if the beta is of significant quality.
---
Frankly, if there isn't a beta, I'd be greatly concerned about not just the accuracy of Classic, but also generally the dedication of Blizzard to this project. Starting out by being concerned over the loss of a single month of a few subscribers is not exactly a good thing.
---
I'd love this idea. Cosmetic only Arenas. Weave it into the world in a Vanilla like way where you have to visit the area physically to do them, etc. 
---
Doesn't that disregard all the utility that a druid brings though??
---
Nope. My position is perfectly in line with human nature - some will abuse the system, and it will be enough to change the dynamics of the game.
---
Ok so your position is that when you need an item, roll on it, and win it - that item does not belong to you and the other members of your group get to decide what you’re allowed to do with it. Got it. 
---
Man. It takes less than a second to type "SPOILERS". And even if it only saves one person that amazing experience that this reveal is, that should be totally worth it in my book. 
---
But maybe that's "delusional" and "obviously wrong". 
---
coding wise it was probably always a placeholder for the npc. I can see that being something they shipped too early to finalise in time.
---
Hell yeah! I don't care for the updated models. They are a bit too... Disneyland for me. The older models were more rough around the edges but this gave them a more menacing quality. The original horde models were much better for this reason.
---
I care
---
Most pservers never even release Naxx.  Those that do see the populations decline after a while.
---
Big difference here is that you are paying a sub fee for Classic.  Most people don't want to pay $15 a month to raid Naxx over and over.  
---
They'll probably end up releasing BC if Classic is financially viable.  I have a hard time seeing them devoting development time to creating additional level 60 content like a T3.5 raid.
---
Private servers. Retail is for people trying to smoke sage when wanting weed.
---
Leveling a Shaman I will absolutely need totem addons. Also new bar addons hell. I will keep add-ons to a minimal
---
“No changes.. unless it affects my hardcore play style”
---
Well, there are alternatives, but I can't explicitly name them here if catch my drift.
---
Undead Warlock on an RP server. They fit thematically. In vanilla to current release I've only ever played the alliance. And I've always enjoyed warlock but never really ended up maining one as my guild in release has always needed healers.
---
I just wanted to play something completely different. Majority of people I played vanilla with still play retail / quit recently after BFA's launch and want to experience it again in a slightly different light.
---
I only had the experience of RP walking with someone completing the quest. Horde quest was not nearly as rewarding 
---
Probably pretty accurate.  I know alliance kind of got the shit end of the stick with SoV though
---
Same.  I've played healer in everything except vanilla, and I think its because its my strong suit.  To the point where now I play support roles in any game possible. 
---
quite the opposite, its incredibly easy to catch up  
---
Ok it seems like a lot. Is their a catch-up guide or somewhere you can send me? I’m 350 ilvl on my Resto Druid and like ilvl 117 on my neck. 
---
I love trolls, unfortunately the hatred for the lack of shoes is too much for me to look past. 
---
King B has/had cobra reflexes which later became a BC ability for hunters to give pets. King B is/was the only pet with it iirc.
---
I did PvP servers back on retail and on pservers. It's a mixed bag.
---
With PvP servers you have the added layer of worrying about the opposite faction and having to map out your quests based on how many Horde/Alliance are in the area and how aggressive they are. This does sometimes create bonds and rivalries that last deep into the life of the server.
---
But there's the sort of ugly reality that people tend to downplay and that is that 'PvP' on PvP servers usually just means griefing and ganking. On all the PvP servers I've played on over the years a majority of the PvP events were incredibly one-sided, ranging from 2v1 fights while you're already killing a mob to some scrub 60 sitting in a quest spot for hours and not letting people play. Part of the 'community building' of PvP servers is everyone being harassed by the same few gankers in the same few spots.
---
At the beginning of the server it won't be so bad as all the zones will be packed with both factions, but once the server is a few months old you'll frequently see max level characters running around low level areas and picking on people. It can be fun with the added sense of danger, and rewarding from evading or outplaying a ganker, but you will inevitably encounter times where you just want to sit and play but can't due to a ganker camping a quest hub.
---
There's also the random chance of who else is on your server. On retail I don't recall too many hardcore PvPers, mostly just small fights over resources around the world. But on pservers there have been many PvPers who basically just sit around a zone all day trying to make people ragequit, sometimes even designing an entire guild around the goal of making zones totally unplayable for one faction due to ganking. If you wind up on a more casual server then it should be fun spicing things up with some PvP, but if you end up being grouped with no-lifer PvPers you will most likely have to avoid entire zones.
---
I am not sure which AV we will get, but if the part turn ins to summon the god is still there, you can get all Alliance/ all Horde reputation.  I did that back in Vanilla to get mounts from all the factions.
---
Yes but where does that rep come from? Only place i know that gives Darnassus rep is Ashenvale.
---
Wrathgate is the casualification of epic questlines. Pretty much a mindless non challenging quest that everyone gets to experience. Therefore not epic at all because it doesn't feel very rewarding.
---
Cool cinematic though
---
is that loltyler1?
---
Thank you typing this up, my english isn't articulate enough and this is always the point I try to make. They've already made another thread to lobby for the new models that's currently being upvoted. :/
---
Yep the *nochanges* crowd is a little too strong sometimes.. I like to try and suggest alternate ideas and it's always downvoted to hell because people disagree.  But that's not the point of the downvote.  Trying to encourage discussion about things. 
---
In WotLK I picked up Disc Priest as my alt since I loved being able to play aggressively as a healer and doing lots of damage. I'm assuming that play style as a Priest in Classic, or any other healer just isn't feasible, but if I'm wrong, please let me know!
---
If I can't be an aggressive healer class, I'll probably have my alt be an Enhance Shaman, or possibly a Shadow Priest since my Mage (main) will be Horde and I kind of want 1 character on each faction.
---
If you get 5 perfect gem in a row, Ony will drop an SoJ
---
I dont know how neck ilvl works now, but I played BFA when it first came out for 3 weeks, and then took about 2 months off and leveling up another charcater. Got caught up to my first BFA character in 3 days.  So with their catch up mechanics I'm sure there is SOMEWAY to catch up.  
---
Im pretty sure you can say the words ''private servers'' without getting banned. Especially as a comment.
---
It’s the only way.
---
Mage/Alliance/Gnome
---
I am playing with 5 friends and they want Alliance so no Shaman for me. They are 2 warriors, priest, rogue. I am going mage because I like RPG casters and it rounds our the 5 man group nicely
---
We are also forming a guild if anyone wants to join:
---
Karmaguild.club
---
Personally I love wind serpents, with Lupos being nerfed (as it should) having a strong DD not mitigated by armour is great.  Especially since it's ranged and can be micro'd so the pet actually lives through boss fights.
---
And we are talking activison. Gotta prolong those sub numbers !
---

---
Could the people repeatedly lobbying for new models please watch this rather than pretend the aesthetics of the old game and the new one aren't completely different, jarring, or that the that adding option doesn't fuck off over how people are percieved by other players in game.
---
I like playing rogue. Rogue theorycrafting in vanilla is extremely fun for me. I like warlock too, but unfortunately end game warlock doesn't really allow for the fun playstyles because they're either not optimal or the debuff limit restricts them.
---
True but theramore poses less of a threat than a dragon.
---
I think in order to talk about pvp at the highest possible level then you need to actually be a player playing at the highest possible level.
---
It’s not like this is a vanilla wow based forum or anything...
---
A lot could be wrong, but a lot could be right and people think its wrong. People's memories trick them sometimes and that could hurt classic too.  
---
This brings up the whole sharding argument... People remember the Nost launch where there were hundreds of people in the starting area fighting and contesting for mobs... This never happened on the release in 2004. Most people couldn't even connect to the servers so while there were a few, it wasn't hundreds of people fighting over mobs.. Maybe a max of like 25 in a single area.  So technically sharding in the starting zones could bring back the legit classic feel. 
---
People keep saying they want the classic experience but a lot of people don't remember, or don't realize what the classic experience really was. 
---
You're in the wrong sub my dude. But, I have even worse news. One of two things is going on IMO. Either your install is corrupted and you need to repair it (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7655) or RAM is going bad. Best of luck!
---
I personally think this is the more likely option. Would be awesome if they gave closed beta access to blizzcon ticket holders of this year ;D
---
It's working now. Ram is fine. Destiny works, all my other games work. I found a forum with quite a lot of people saying they had this issue randomly back in 2016 right before maintenance, that is due soon. Very weird! As I say, working after a reboot
---
That's cool af, would love to ride a mechanostrider as a night elf. Btw hypothetically if i would to start as a NE in human zone and lvl through westfall and after that do all the quests for darnassus rep in ashenvale and stonetalon, and the BFD quests. Do you think i will get honored with Darnassus for the 10% rep discount on mounts at 40?
---
Because they designed the class wrong. 
---
More like Krokodil instead of black tar heroin
---
Sure, it only takes a second. On a forum dedicated to discussing a fifteen year old game, we'd be typing that an awful lot.
---
All I'm saying is it's obviously a self centered desire. Not a judgment of its validity. 
---
get rep with champs of azeroth (magni), go to him every time you reach new rep level   
---
you can do LFR for easy 370 now, warfront quest for 370, do some m+ and you'll be ready for BoD raid soon enough  
---
do the island thing for some azerite if you can bear to play through it  
---
thats about it  
---
What about Maraudon?
---
I actually really liked the DAOC player housing and think that was a perfectly fine way to implement it.
---
You could set your bind there, decorate it with in game weapons and items you find. Add a bank and crafting tables at a certain cost that was actually relevant. It was a nice gold sink for people to invest in. Plus you could do something like guild housing and let people bind there / use a guild bank if its not implemented in classic. 
---
There are a lot of ways you can correctly do player housing in classic wow over time, just needs to be thoughtup . The thing I liked most about DAOC's is you could give permissions to your house to certain people, certain ranks in the guild, or just everyone. I loved walking into random houses to see how they had it decorated and laid out. 
---
When dealing with software once you roll over that first number it is considered the next version. 2.0.0 is consider the Burning Crusade version of the game.
---
That thread is awesome
---
I don't think the barber shop came out until BC or maybe Wrath though.
---
You should check the questline for "The Waist Of Time" from BfA. It's amazing. There is still a little heart hidden deep in BlizzActivision. 
---
Thanks. It's all so very clear now. Classic will be a totally different experience knowing this.
---
Oh la di da! Look who has coins to spend on flightpaths.
---
&gt;would love to ride a mechanostrider as a night elf.
---
That won't be possible, as racial restrictions for Mechanostriders (Dwarf and Gnome only), and the vendor bought Raptors and Skeletal Horses (No Tauren) were still in place until Patch 3.0.8.
---
&gt; LEGITIMATELY THAT IS THE REASON HE WANTS HER DEAD
---
I seem to remember there being a similar reasoning as the horde version of "rescue princess moira" presented as well. Which is that Thrall doesn't necessarily see the alliance as enemies since the events of WC3 so he doesn't like fundamental threats that can also cause them to turn their focus against the horde (like Onyxia did) and he tries to garner some measure of goodwill (like he wished to do with dwarves by rescuing their princess).
---
Heroic level dungeons give 355 gear now if that helps.  Running some low mythics will probably gear you relatively quickly. 
---
My first epic ever was a glowing brightwood staff. One of my friends had it drop for him off the satyrs in Azshara. I camped that thing for weeks after he got his then one day i decided to stay home from school and just farm those things all day long and it dropped. It was completely random what it dropped off and I realized that but I got what I wanted.  
---
Sad thing is... I only wanted it to sell and by the time I actually got it to sell it was only worth a couple hundred gold. 
---
People wouldn't care because it's only YOU seeing it.
---
I've tried every race/class combo extensively in Classic, and for me Night Elf Hunter just feels right. I even tried forcing myself to be an Orc, because on paper I am in love with their racials. I abandoned the Orc shortly after hitting 60. There is no denying my true nature, I am a filthy tree-hugging hippie elf.
---
Yup warlock pets and charge combat are two of the big ticket items so far, but I'm sure there will be countless others that are challenged.
---
Reckoning is a protection talent that gives the paladin one extra hit on his next attack every time he gets crit that stacks up to four times. It can be abused on most private servers by aggroing a mob and using /sit to get crit a few times and then instantly hit your next target for 5 hits in one. /sit isn't supposed to be able to proc it normally.
---
The one part that's a bit neater than the alliance version is that instead of a really long escort quest you get to hop to silithus, wetlands, Swamp of Sorrows, and Winterspring to kill four bosses. It's a bit of travel but it's a really nice change of pace to just hang out with four other people to go places you may not have explored that thoroughly and they even drop some decent items iirc. 
---
Yes disc priest works well in raids. Especially human ones as they can stack so much Regen that they almost never go oom.
---
Source: raided with a really good disc priest in Vanilla 
---
Glad you chose For the Horde!
---
People are right: pvp servers are mostly unfair fights. 
---
Fair fights, uninterrupted questing/gathering and all that is fine, but it gets old for me. You miss out on so much. I've had multiple gankers camp me, but the others experiences i wouldn't trade for anything, and they would've never happened on a PVE server.
---
WHELPS WHELPS WHELPS
---
Thanks for filling me in
---
Just Viper Sting until he's oom? A hunter's range is 41 yards, spriest is 36.
---
Gearing is **far** easier as a warlock than spriest. Just something to consider.
---
Also the horde has an alliance with the ogres, so Thrall has to take into account that Onyxia nuking the Dustwallow ogres might be a blow to the horde even thought maybe minor.
---
You could probably get honored if you do all of the starting area quests, but probably not worth it as far as time cost/ benefit goes.  You make so much more money as you level up that the time you spent doing those quests could have been spent questing at your level, skinning (then vendoring the skins), etc would more than make up for the money you will save when buying anything really.
---
I did tank in the last half of vanilla through-out most of TBC. I can with 100% certainty say that it was worth the pain.  
---
Question Number 1: Is it still worth it for the group/queue advantages. 
---
The answer to this is YES. You will be able to either make groups fairly easily and quickly or just join one. You will also have a lot of people adding you to their friends list to hit you up for groups later on which can definitely be a big plus when gearing up to raid. Usually after youre 60 and wanting to get in the raiding scene, if you don't make your own guild, or join a guild early on as a Main tank you can probably expect to be DPS. But the nice thing about tanks in classic is that hardly any of them were speced prot after a while. Most of them were Arms / Fury warriors main tanking raids still. So you can still DPS and just build up a tank set to step into one of those roles as needed or progress your way through the guild chain to become a MT. 
---
Question Number 2: Is leveling as a warrior bad enough to not be worth trying to tank? 
---
Not at all. While leveling a warrior is a little bit slower and rougher than other classes, if you put your head down and just do it... You'll be fine. It may take you a couple extra days to hit 60 but if you want to play a warrior in end game, just do it. You wont regret it after the leveling process is over. While leveling is a giant part of the classic experience, so is end game. The leveling experience will consist of about 30 days for the average player more than likely, and we already have 2 years of content to roll out. 1/24 months to actually do what you want to do. JUST DO IT!
---
Question Number 3: Is it fun to tank in Classic?   
---
I thought it was. The raid relied on you a lot, groups relied on you to be quick. While in current content in wow its sort of the same, but in classic wow you were known through-out the server if you were a badass tank. Being a badass DPS or Healer is one thing, but being a badass tank can literally set the pace for anything and people across the entire server knew you. I still remember the tank's name on Azgalor that I thought was a badass Drazhar, Dwarf Warrior with Thunderfury. 
---
Making mistakes happens, missing taunts happens, but in my honest opinion they were much more forgiving in classic. Yes it still sucks when your MT gets fucked up on chromag or something, but shit happens. Especially in groups. Warriors have battle shout for AOE threat in dungeon groups, so people are much more focused on CCing and not running through a place at the speed of light. They will understand if theres 5 mobs that are actively being tanked and you lose aggro on one. 
---
I leveled a Warrior on a private server, and i absolutely hated the slow grind.
---
I want a class that can stay competitive end game, but has decent leveling. I'd play rogue, but I can't stand the backstab gimmick. I was thinking warlock, but I'm not sure.
---
Also, I don't plan on PVPing much outside of what I need to do while leveling
---
It blows my mind how many times the adventurer youre playing is messing things up.
---
Helping Onyxia by doing quests for her, the whole abercrombie questline, the horde indirectly summoning Hakkar into the world.
---
They really shouldnt be helping hapless noobs all over the world!
---
you will get some darnassus rep from the quests in human lands. You need 5000 rep total by level 40 to reach honored. Trust me, you will reach honored, like, you'd have to actively try avoid darnassus rep to not get honored by 40. Ashenvale alone awards something like 6k+ rep
---
Get out
---
Hemo maces all day
---
People also play those other expansions. I am not saying people play on private servers because they are free, but sometimes, the best working servers are for Classic and you are bound to have at least some people whose only way to play WoW is on private servers and they pick Classic servers to do that.
---
Bear in mind that outside of few projects, there are no good Cata servers and the only decent MoP server is made by Hungarians. So playing old expansions is pretty much the only way and it just so happens that Classic private servers are in far better state than TBC or WotLK.
---
If you wanna be a dick, hide behind the tower and wipe groups when they get to the last part of this quest. Then to restart it they have to wait for the NPC to respawn, go and get their disguise and head all the way back north in WPL. Upside, the quest can technically be soloed with a bit of fancy mount work though.
---
OhMyGod Theramore, I can't breathe because of the hype, my favorite questing zone on my old Night Elf warrior.
---
Some quest givers are marked with the &lt;Alliance&gt; tag. Quests given by them reward reputation with all the major factions of the alliance.
---
If you're not sure if you should scratch your itch, WebMD might be a better place to find answers.
---
For all the cities. When questing
---
don't bother with retail. the homogenized to the point there's really no point to playing a class over the other. they all have the same tricks. gearing up is just pulling a number of slot machines, granting gear that really doesn't feel that special/memorable. and to top it all off, no one cares about anyone else. it's basically a single player game. google private server subreddit to find a vanilla one if you want to experience wow as you remember it.
---
Here you go: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aklw9q/looking_for_group_monday_january_28_2019/ef5zhud/
---
Shaman, paladin, and druid are all in the same boat. They have 1 best pve spec and then everything else is for fun- just to let you know- shaman is still very much a healing class in pve
---
Yeah, nah dawg. 
---
&gt; Most quests for an Alliance or Horde faction will give full reputation gain for that faction, and one quarter of that reputation gain for the other factions on that side. For example, a quest completed for a Stormwind NPC will give 250 Stormwind reputation and 62.5 reputation for the other Alliance factions. This "spillover" reputation gain is capped at "friendly" (5999/6000);
---

In the quest leading up to Wrathgate where you take down a lich, there’s a part where Bolvar comes in to help you. If you were one of the players that completed the Ony chain, Bolvar says to you, “Don’t think I’ve forgotten what you did for me all those years ago, friend. It’s good to see that you’re well.”
---
He doesn’t say this to characters rolled after TBC that never got attuned to Ony.
---
Back in WotLK when I saw this doing that quest the first time, it was a bit emotional. It was an awesome little shoutout, and I wish Blizz did stuff like that more often.
---
why did we open the gates for AQ again? it always seemed silly to undo what the dragons achieved under great loss
---
The frontstabbing is a private server thing, I haven't seen any confirmation that it existed in Vanilla so it probably won't exist in Classic. That being said, combat swords is the more efficient leveling spec, partly because of the huge number of swords that are available while you're leveling. If you don't want to be tied down to a certain weapon, you can go combat without picking up any of the weapon-specific talents or you can go for a hemo build.
---
Rogues are as slow, if not slower, than warriors. Warriors have hamstring kiting that can reduce the damage they take by a huge amount whereas rogues have to face-tank everything.
---
Warlocks are definitely faster levelers, and arguably better farmers. 
---
Hope that helps!
---
&gt; eleasing when its ready
---
Wow wasn't ready when it launched, it was very incomplete.
---
PvP and Solo, there is a bunch of niche min/max things you can do to stand out slightly, since you have spell scaling and melee. Which is pretty rare in actually in WoW. You'd think a magic melee caster would be somewhat common, but really its not -- a shaman is the closest thing to a battle mage in the game.
---
However, when it comes to raid PvE especially -- a shaman is just a healer.  Much like most druids, paladins and preists, you are designated to mashing a single heal spell for the duration of the raid . Its just the way the game is mechanically and most useful role a shaman can do.
---
Nah my vanilla main was a pally and I was prot specced with unstoppable force. Reckoning how it is is still fantastic, you can still 1 shot people in pvp....you just can’t spam a sit macro or waste hours of your life building charges to misuse the talent. People give it a bad rep for some reason but it’s working as intended!
---
Yea fear ward is pretty good :)
---
Hey I didn't want to make a new post but wanted to get some continued feedback on whether this Warlock spec would be worth running in dungeons.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IAzbhobZcZtxotM0tp
---
The whole idea is maximized front loaded damage, spreading immolate/Corr and utilizing Conflagration/Shadowburn/Nightfall.
---
I'd love opinions, too much threat? simply bad damage compared to meta specs? thanks a million.
---
the aq 40 world event was a god sent for those wanting reputation
---
So I'm thinking of starting a tauren hunter. It's what I played on the first character I ever made, I really love the tauren lore, model, and starting zone, and I also find vanilla hunters really interesting, since things like pet happiness and ammo, while tedious, seem like genuine oldschool RPG mechanics.   
---
   
---
However, I'm a bit worried about gimping myself by starting a tauren hunter, instead of an orc or troll. Taurens don't really bring anything to the table as hunters. I'm personally not bothered much by doing 5% less dps than the other hunters, but I'm worried that it will prevent me from getting into raids. I'd probably call myself a semi-casual player (when I play retail, I usually do heroic and a few bosses in mythic raids). How bad is the discrimination against suboptimal race/class combos gonna be? Anyone with private server/OG vanilla experience that can chime in?
---
I can recommend this but only to level 20. (Around 20 hours of content) any more and you will burn out when the game comes out live. 
---
Vanilla is punishing and difficult. (Background: I’ve been testing each starting zone and following zones to 20 as a warrior).
---
It seems PvP often becomes the home of misfit toys for all the guilds that disband and don’t decide to go back into raiding.  That’s what happened in my case as well.
---
Just wondering what makes you think a good spriest loses to a good warrior, rogue, mage, or hunter? A spriest has an incredible matchup against all of those. Very confused by this.
---
My first too.  Dropped in winter spring off the yetis in the beginning if I remember correctly. 
---
disc is still fairly offensive in classic especially compared to the other healers
---
I played a human warrior and was glad in TBC/WOTLK so I never got to experience end-game vanilla content/pvp but I've always fantasized about having that Grand Marshall Gear and the R14 sword. Even though likely I'll never have the time for it, it's still possible. 
---
As an alt I'll probably play warlock. Human again because I think they generally look best in their gear. Orc warlock is a definite maybe.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** disposition44! ^(hug)
---
HOT
---
PvE Restoration: A Shaman is normally expected to heal in end-game raids. Spamming chain heal is overpowered if down-ranked to conserve mana.
---
PvE Enhancement: Some raids may be willing to take a single enhancement Shaman as a support class (windfurty totem, nightfall axe, etc.), but enhancement shamans just don't have the dps to compete with most pure dps classes.
---
PvE Elemental: An elemental Shaman can be powerful in PvE if they have a lot of spellpower gear, but mana is normally a big issue.  
---
PvP Elemental: An Elemental Shaman can be great for burst dps, but they lack cc abilities. Spellpower gear and mana conservation is also important.
---
PvP Restoration: In pre-made PvP groups, a Shaman is normally healing and supporting the group.
---
PvP Enhacement: Can do great burst damage, but it normally depends on a Windfury proc. They can throw out huge numbers or they can be very unlucky. 
---
Solo play and less-competitive PuGs are more likely to take any spec if the Shaman knows what they're doing. In the end, just play what you think is the most fun!
---
Wasn't it because the Silithid were leaking out in larger numbers anyway? As in, we learned that there is no truly containing them, and we needed to kill C'thun to stop the Silithid from rampaging.
---
Can you do a TL;DR for the Alliance version? I've never played Alliance myself. 
---
Yeah i'm not particularly attached to the old models but the updated ones are very hit and miss. Dwarves are fine for example but human females fall right into the uncanny valley and are absolutely terrifying to look at while the ones who are actually supposed to be scary monsters just look like goofy cartoon characters.
---
&gt; So let's ban all kinds of things that might be tools for thieves?
---
Well we can lock our door and intall an alarm and not leave the keys in the car...
---
What he said
---
Yeah I just got used to the term reckoning bomb meaning literally the sit crit bug (feature?). It doesn't invalidate the whole class at all but I know people who are bummed about them not being able to use sit crits on their warrior either.
---
No thanks. Old graphics were gross. If there's one thing i hope they add, it's updated graphics.
---
Take a warm coat. 
---
Not if the abundance of dwarfs is high enough.  With equal gear and presumably equal skill, youd take the dwarf every time.  
---
The Tauren were the biggest victims of this. I pictured them as hulking minotaurs and the new models are just too damn cute. Gnomes on the other hand benefited from the change.
---
Very true
---
Not really if I’m honest.
---
I don’t think they should be changed in classic but retail character models are great.
---
warriors are gods in 1v1 with fap, impressive knowledge
---
I for sure am, Warriors are ONLY good with healers babysitting. When a class needs another class to be good, then obviously they end up last.
---
Warrior is also the worst class 1v1 or 1vX
---
The only raids that won't take you based on your race and such aren't raids you'd have fun in the first place. In fact, I'd actually say that's a positive bonus as it weeds out particularly unfun raid nights.
---
Which sucks because for purely arbitrary reasons the devs decided to put off till pre-patch a lot of bug fixes and talent changes that were finished and done for Vanilla.
---
Since you describe yourself as semi-casual, I don't think you'll have a problem.  Hardcore raiding guilds are going to be the ones most likely to discriminate against non-min/max'd players.  I think if you played a hunter (of any race) and farmed some consumables and showed up for raid time consistently, you'll have no problem getting into raids.  Especially MC, since hunters are pretty good dps in MC.  
---
Once you get beyond BWL, hunter DPS drops off and they are brought more for tranq shot and occasional kiting.  So being a Tauren doesn't matter then either, what matters then is that you have cemented your place in the core raid group as one of the 2-3 hunters that are brought along.  
---
So in your mind, how much of PvP is 1v1 or 1vX and how much is 2 or more  vs X? Lets say it is 50/50. Half of pvp is done alone and half in a group. I would argue it is much more common to pvp in a group than 1v1 but I'll let you have 50/50. So if a warrior is the best 50% of the time, and the worst 50% of the time, does that make them the worst overall? That seems to be what you are saying.
---
I'm not actually advocating doing it, I was being glib. I had a 5 man alliance team camp our group for an hour wiping our group everytime we would get to that point. Finally had to get 10 guildies to come and just fight the campers long enough to finish the quest 
---
Aww that sucks.. my dream is shattered.
---
Are we not allowing for consumes to come into play either? Are you asking what is the best race/class combo for PvP in classic without consumes and assuming you are pvping alone? Because that is what it seems like.
---
If you're maximizing front-loaded damage I would say I hope to God you're Alliance with a Paladin or you might be in for a rude awakening (i.e.: death).
---
Only real damage issue I see is spreading your damage types a bit. Obviously Immolate/Conflag won't benefit from Shadow damage talents and vice versa. It's not a bad spec, I just think you will be running numbers outside of initial burst a little on the lower side.
---
Fair! 
---
I’m all for pvp but I dislike the malicious approach some take. But it is what it is. 
---
OH i see that's very helpful thanks.
---
Are you me?
---
 I miss and or don't remember a lot of the old quests.. and I'm glad we're going to be able to do them again.
---
I could write the same amount of text in response to prove your wrong, but its just not worth the time. If you are to think to see that Orc is better than Gnome then why bother, its like trying to argue with flat-earthers.
---
That's literally all i needed to know. Thanks a lot i appreciate it.
---
One of the primary points of the old honor system was to disincentivize ganking, so working as intended.
---
PvP excursions become laughably easy with proper consumables in your inventory. Do not feel bad stocking and using these tools in your disposal!
---
Free Action Potion is a warrior's bread-and-butter for the solo lifestyle, but also works really well in BGs as well. If you have/know an alchemist, its worth the money if you can spare it.
---
If not, pick fights you can win and get the hell away from others you won't. There is the possibility your opponent is not skilled, so you can still etch out wins from seemingly impossible odds. When in doubt, try hitting your opponent with your oversized giant hammer and watch them die!
---
"it has nothing at all to do with other classes"
---
What?? Obviously it affects all classes, come back sober!
---
Theres another one that you get right around sword of omen, vanquishers sword.  Such a cool combo. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/quest=3341/bring-the-end
---
Be very clear to her about how much.  Better to have her pissed now and accepting it when it happens.
---
I mean you have been downvoted repeatedly in this thread while the people who talk about gnome warrior are upvoted. So I think at this point you need to justify your position because people are not agreeing with you. 
---
Here is the way I see it:
---
Duels:
---
Gnome is best. Counters the hardest matchups with escape artist. Doesn't have to duel orcs or undead. (Unlike orcs)
---
BG:
---
Gnome because of blessing of freedom. 
---
World PvP solo:
---
Orc because of stun resist and not having to fight orcs/undeads. S
---
World PvP in group:
---
Gnome
---
Overall :
---
So don't.
---
Also, if it is as clear cut and obvious that orcs are better than gnomes, it should be simple for you to justify your position. 
---
Warriors has more than charge stun, they have grenades, tidal charm, intercept.
---
Also, dealing with pala is like the easiest thing ever as a Hunter
---
Orc &gt; Dwarf 100%
---
This is a pretty sound break down of roles. 
---
You’re welcome Turanka, thanks so much for taking the time to send along these kind words, means the world to me and certainly keeps the show chugging along, thanks mate :)
---
BegaKing,
---
Thanks so much for letting me know, taking the time out of your day just to send along this note of encouragement really does put a spring in my step, so thanks so much for being part of the reason that the show keeps going!
---
Perfectly in line with human nature according to whom? 
---
If someone sells an item instead of equipping it, it means he didn't need it. It's that simple. Just wanting to sell a drop is called "greed". You know the need/greed difference. 
---
Rolling need when you don't actually need an item makes you a ninja, just as it has always been. 
---
I fail to see a charge for a poop sock. This proves nothing. 
---
Just weird that you came here for answers instead of retail site
---
I think you meant to use the word "parity"
---
I don't know what retail site is. If I had known of a better option I would have chosen that. Not so weird in that case. This is a wow sub, and it looks like my wow related issue is in the wrong place. The only answer I was seeking, was if anyone else is currently having the problem, I never asked for anything more than that
---
I'll be playing a female human Warlock. 
---
Why?
---
1. This was my main back in Vanilla and more recently in private servers. Therefore, little need to invest time into learning the class.
---
2. I prefer the female human aesthetic for casters.
---
3. I prefer alliance because there will be less warlocks and WoTF is not hard to work around with a succubus, as I'll mainly be SM/Ruin.
---
4. It's so easy to farm gold with a Warlock that I didn't even wait for the patch for 60 Warlock mounts to buy my epic mount on private servers.
---
5. Warlocks are not macro dependent, assuming no good combo macros can be made using the modern engine's macro system.
---
6. It's the least picked of a few dps classes whose PvE spec can work in PvP; albeit, not so good in BG's.
---
 Even if i still have this on retail. I want my anathema/ Benediction back :)
---
Or discover you are pregnant and have cancer at the same time.
---
rogue and gank
---
lol I have done the same thing.
---
"How do I know if I've completed the quest?"
---
Trial by fire
---
&gt; Most of them were Arms / Fury warriors main tanking raids still. So you can still DPS and just build up a tank set to step into one of those roles as needed or progress your way through the guild chain to become a MT.
---
Man so many great responses. I wanted to ask about the ^^ above. I was watching one of [TipsOut videos](https://youtu.be/KzQ4P6huu6M?t=1848) about warrior. They ended up recommending [this 31/20](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxbAio0dVVzu0h) build.
---
You think if I used this build, I'd be able to DPS in a raid and tank in a 5 man? Or would I want to go full Fury for raid?
---
This doesn't apply well to my situation, but thank you for replying.
---
It took me quite a long time to sort out my thoughts, because so many classes, specs, races, etc. look fun! Haha...hopefully this will help you.
---
Human Paladin. Human because I prefer their appearance and the look of their animations. Paladin for the following reasons.
---
I want to be self-sufficient and useful as a support role in groups, and I like the idea that Paladin can pretty much do anything.
---
I enjoy healing, so I don't mind being a healbot/buffbot in raids.
---
Reckoning seems fun, and I look forward to trying it out in PvP.
---
Paladin can farm several mobs at a time making gold farming and leveling more interesting, fun, and, potentially, more efficient.
---
I enjoy the class fantasy and want to be Alliance. Plus, their tier sets are bomb.
---
I've watched and read guides and have done other research on leveling, farming, raiding, etc. I know what spec I'll run at each stage of the game (leveling spec, pre-raid spec, raid spec, PvP spec) and when, mostly to save on respec costs...we'll see how that goes.
---
Fortunately, Paladin fits exactly what I'm looking for, but I can say that, ultimately, I reached a point where I just decided on a class and never looked back. It's a freeing feeling. Super hyped for Classic!

Well, according to [this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aldzxe/know_your_classic_dungeons/efd8hvt/?context=2) this information is from Brady games in '06. If that is indeed the case then I don't think these numbers are off considering the date of publishing.

Haha good to see someone else remembering this.
---
My thoughts first, my hopes second.
---
I think the two reasons there isn't a go to non healer version of shaman is...
---
Elemental is okay and can use a lot of the same restoration gear, so it can be built parallel to each other. This is easy to gear &amp; farm. 
---
Enhancement is an effective teammate and does nearly as much DPS  as elementals, when geared and talented into FULLY. Can't just dip your toe in and get results, it's balls deep or nothing. You are a melee caster, you need procs to boost damage and reduce spell costs. Lots of RNG, and solo it really doesn't stand out.  But when part of a group/raid, such a force multiplier.
---
PvP, I recall seeing way more enchantment than elemental, but both were heavy into the healing tree.
---
My hope is that now that more players are looking into what makes their class work, how stats effect things, what to stack and just being more informed as a community, we get more out of shamans, druids and paladins. 
---
I have some suspicions that even private servers DPS meters and logs are off (a little) for the sole reason that if a player wanted to be top DPS, they took mage/rouge/warrior and tried hard.  They had dozens of guides to point out how to optimize their build/rotation for every encounter. They were already players pushing them selves and had good shoulders to stand on.  Plus the community already agreed they would be top.
---
The hybrids have to figure a lot out on their own, and since there is no 'agreed build/gear/rotation' their is a lot of experimentation and starting over, re gearing, etc. Then they have to push against the you need to heal or just the general, do more, how? I don't know, but if you can't reach this DPS, we won't have room as DPS.  Against all that, why would a die hard, try hard player signup for that? 
---
Anyway, I have some suspicions that the best players avoided these classes cause it wouldn't be 'optimal' to have to prove your numbers/work all the time.
---
Whoops
---
“You don’t scare me at all one bit  
---
‘Til you’ve seen Prestor throw a fit.”
---
Just a suggestion but, you should label the map next time. Other then that this is really cool.
---
Yes because my cpu will move fast again
---
Yeah I agree with you. Altough vanilla had some pretty cool questlines, it's the Wotlk ones I remember the most.
---
Wrathgate is still the most epic thing I've ever experienced in any MMO.
---
Put "testicular cancer" on that to make it even more ironic.
---
Boomkin: Why?
---
Enh shammy: You can one round people if you get good gear and, people don't kite you. Pretty viable honestly people get distracted a lot then they die lol.
---
Combat rogue: Always good in world pvp for obvious reasons but, once people get gear Rogues are bad in BG's.
---
Arcane mage: If you mean you wanna cast arcane spells as your primary dps. Then no it's garbage but, PoM pyro is a pretty deep arcane spec.
---
Demonology warlock: If you mean straight demo and, not SL/SL then no. It's poopsters.
---
Ret Paladin: As long as you are willing to cast cleanse they are always "viable" lol. Other then that pretty much like a Shammy. Get gear and, win.
---
Fury Warrior: Until Impossible till AQ, preferred by Naxx. No reason to need mortal strike when your enemies just explode into blood and viscera.
---
49 warrior.  Previous horde may roll alliance and do a pally in the 29 to 49 range
---
&gt;While they usually do betas they're almost finished products
---
And then there's BfA.
---
&gt;No one (non blizz employee) knew this existed until that very moment.
---
The good old times. These days every single detail gets datamined two months before the patch.
---
Frodo also takes the ring to Mordor where it gets destroyed.
---
I love the healing from Devouring Plague
---
I started just before BC and had no clue what was going on when I wandered into someone completing this quest.
---
It was amazing.
---
you had to go through brd every time you wanted to enter, including after wipes
---
then they added the invisible portal and later the npc
---
you can also go into bwl through ubrs portal above rend event without doing the preQ, which is only for the orb that teleports you into bwl
---
In raids as a healer class you will virtually never DPS. But in PvP if you want to play an offensive healer class go elemental shaman, 30/0/21 build which allows you to swap flexibly between DPSing and healing based on the situation.
---
You did. 40 fucking people through BRD just to start MC. Shit was a nightmare. 
---
&gt;You haven't addressed any of the solid points I have made about gnomes, faction not mattering as much if you are considering duels, etc. You just want everyone to tell you that you are right.
---
Guess I was right.
---
&gt;Damn dude, how can you get dunked on so much in one thread?
---
And yet instead of posting a single shred of evidence that SoR proccinge effects was a bug, you just keep insulting everyone that make arguments to the contrary. It speaks volumes about the kind of person you are. Just another loner on the Internet who cant handle an actual argument. I find it hillarious.
---
I did this on a private server and fell to my death.
---
Undead priest devouring plague is pretty top.
---
&gt; Very rarely would someone find this "fun". What it is, however, is a permanent sense of excitement knowing that you could get your day ruined at any moment. It makes it feel more alive and dangerous.
---
You could achieve about the same effect by having your character randomly die for no reason every now and again, forcing you to to a corpse run. And then randomly die again as soon as you rez sometimes.
---
Personally that's not what I want in a game but as I said, if it's fun for you then please enjoy it.
---
Nailed it. Just turned 29 and have 3 little shits. No regrets. I love them and embrace the chaos. It actually drives me to be a better person. I'm selfish in little bursts but mostly live for the betterment of my family. Classic Wow will be a "little burst" of selfishness. ;-)
---
My favourite and most heartbreaking one stays Pamela Redpath and her doll 
---
Our raid leader had a whole speech he’d give describing the quest line.
---
I'll take what I get. I've played private servers a lot and don't think I would care if a few changes were made. Just excited to jump back in again.
---
Probably right on this... I'll check back and confirm on launch day 
---
Right now I'm 99% locked into a Dwarf Priest.
---
Also toying with the idea of a Human Mage (because I've never played one past 20).
---
I like the idea of healing and helping out my mates though.
---
Missed the point of the post bud. I only begin playing any game these days once the kiddos are tucked in bed. They are, and will always be #1. 
---
Yeah the 15% is a guarantee on money transfer.
---
&gt; Yep - at the deepest level it has nothing to do with the actual fighting.
---
At the deepest level, all world PvP is, is that someone can fight you when they want. That's it.
---
&gt; That said you can choose to be a merciless oppressor, a protector, an opportunist, an honorable duelist etc.
---
Indeed. But you can't choose what everyone on the other faction does, so whatever you choose a very likely outcome is that someone with a massive advantage over you in gear/skill/level/situation/allies just kills you every now and then. And this chance increases as the server ages and the population of bored people with level sixty toons increases, and Classic will be around for a while.
---
&gt; Playing vanilla on a PvE server strips away an entire juicy layer that produces some of the best emergent gameplay. 
---
But also strips away a lot of extremely awful, pointless gameplay. So you pays your money and you takes your choice, as I have been saying.
---
&gt; Everyone gets to decide for themselves what their “moral code” is for attacking the enemy.
---
As I said, if this is a major source of enjoyment for you then you should be on a PvP server.
---
But as I also said, anything resembling an interesting fight is the exception rather than the rule. Rock/paper/scissor class imbalance plus gear/skill/level/situation/numbers imbalance adds up. I think to a large extent enjoying a PvP server requires being blind to this, wilfully or otherwise.
---
I'd rather play WoW PvE, which I think is a far better game, and save PvP for either organised PvP in battlegrounds or for some other game that has better PvP.
---
So many judgements here... Not sure if serious or?? Anyhow, see previous reply to the neglection police
---
Is the implication here that Theramore is a threat? Its entire founding was based on peace with the Horde.
---
So happy I found this. Will be checking it out!
---
&gt;PvP flagged
---
Playing classic in a PvE server is the objectively wrong way to enjoy the game.
---
Simple: I am and always have been a raging altoholic. I'll be playing all of 'em at some point or another (at least class-wise - I plan to roll a dwarven pally, but that'll probably be my only Ally character), and probably all mixed together so I never have a clear "main." Sure, it'll mean lagging behind those with greater focus, but I'm not particularly bothered about getting my name on anyone's lips regarding achievements. It's about the journey, after all.
---
I don’t have the extra time to deal with the setbacks from playing a PvP server anymore :/ getting old blows.
---
U dont have time to have fun?
---
The problem with side progression is that players won’t want to do it. ( the majority ) due to there being no rewards. Or the side progression will be easier than naxx, so nobody will do naxx because this uldum raid gives equal gear for less work.
---
This is my exact dilemma. I am also an altholic, but I just really want to reach end game and actually get a chance to do raids.
---
What ends up happening every xpac for me is that by the time I get one of my characters to max level and start to PvP or Raid, the game is a few patches away, of moving on to new xpac. 
---
At least with Classic, this might not be the case, assuming they don't release TBC, etc. 
---
As of now, my main is 80% a paladin, or 20% a priest, warlock, hunter, or rogue. /facepalm
---
Sometimes I just wanna quest. I like having the option nowadays.
---
It's mainly for a gold sink and a place for RP'ers to ...well..role play.
---
Other games attach a merchant style due to no auction house mechanics(dark age of camelot for example) to housing as well as crafting and a bunch of other things.
---
Didn’t know that, interesting and good point
---
The implication is that it would be Theramore's problem since Theramore is a buffer between Onyxia and Orgrimmar
---
in premades shamans will be almost exclusively elemental.
---
I feel like this is a troll post lol.
---
Housing belongs in retail.  Its essentially a minigame, which takes away from the actual game - leveling, PvP, raids.  Once you start introducing other things, as we've seen, you call to the casuals.  Not that Classic can't have casual players, but housing isn't gameplay.  If you want housing, go play Second Life.  Sorry to be blunt lol
---
So then you agree that spoilers tabs should be done away with?
---
PvP Restoration is so bad; I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone.   As a shaman your best defense is a good offense anything less than 30 point in Elemental talents you are gimping yourself and everyone you’re playing with.
---
enjoyment is inherently subjective, but i guess pvp servers are so superior to you that you can't imagine anyone feeling differently about it. the past 3 years i only played vanilla by myself, leveling from time to time, and there was no way i was gonna put up with nothing but inconvenience coming from random, often unfair/unavoidable, encounters. i also exclusively play the dark souls series in offline mode.
---
that said, i'll rally up with irl friends on classic and will absolutely choose a pvp server then. 
---
I'm also debating whether or not having the permanent quest of destroying the pathetic Alliance is worth it or not.
---
I'd actually go Priest or Druid. With so little time to play you want a strong leveler and a class that's easy to find groups with. Sure Hunter levels fast, but it's not going to be as easy getting a group as healer or a tank. 
---
Paladin Is a fair choice as well, but it's one of the slowest levelers where Priest/Druid are some of the fastest. 
---
Well, even though it's a fifteen year old game it's also one that's about to be released. And I obviously do not advocate tagging every silverleaf location on the map with a spoiler warning but for big stuff like this it's definitely the nicer thing to do.  
---
Love this.
---
I'm surrounded by my people. Loved the completion of this adventure/quest chain.
---
Interesting perspective thanks for your input
---
A hidden factor in private server DPS logs I’ve noticed is fire totems not being included in the shaman’s personal DPS meters.  While the mages are getting crazy DPS on the group packs, the shaman is getting zero DPS from AoE Fire totems. 
---
The biggest argument against Shamans is the mana issue.  When bosses are being killed extremely quick, shamans have an opportunity (if geared correctly) to compete with other casters.  Gearing is a problem because no guild is going to hand out the best caster items to an elemental shaman.
---
Just saw this and read every post, have to just say...there's some funny mofo's in this post! LOL
---
Every post speculating what triggers Deep Breath makes Onyxia 30% more likely to Deep Breath
---
Itemization is way wonkier in Vanilla, so what they *could* do is instead of constantly increasing item level with each raid is add new raids that have certain itemizations not available in others. The problem with retail is Blizz thinks it's set in stone that we have to see a massive power jump with every raid tier. For classic, people want the 1-60 experience, it's a more condensed experience. And because we have a much deeper combat system (glancing blows, crushing blows, hit cap, weapon skill, actual stats, etc.) and 51 talent points to distribute, there's way more wiggle room for what is valuable and what's not in terms of stats. 
---
Fun is subjective and by playing on a PVP server one person's idea of fun (namely killing people lower level than you and camping their corpse as you snicker into your chicken tendies about how salty they must be) can be inflicted upon you whether you like it or not. 
---
Love these things :)
---
Yes babe - It did after 2 Geddon kills :)
---
Nothing more terrifying than being surrounded by 4 of these guys and one female NE in a dungeon.
---
It goes to the Rep of the quest.
---
Which private server would you personally recommend?
---
I was thinking Priest anyway so thanks! I’ll also look into Druid 
---
We aren't allowed to answer that question on this sub.
---
I shall be in a PVP server with my guildies so we can crush our enemies.
---
Sorry I am not good at reddit. I only come here for Classic. I’m trying! Better than nothing 
---
How is warlock farming? Also how is raiding as a lock? Is it just spamming one ability or are there situational things that add flavor to the rotation
---
My way of having fun is the only way to have fun
---
it's interesting how people who hate being able to choose also can't accept the validity of different opinions
---
You wanna quest? Well guess what there are 3 fuckers from the opposite faction tagging all the mobs. Tough shit, no quest for you. What are you going to do about it?
---
STV in a nutshell, but by god this feels rewarding to be dumped into situations like this and have to actually PvP to get something done. There is no such thing anymore in (big) MMORPG as far as I know. It is all about convenience and no bad feelings.
---
Can I get an F in chat for the brave souls that failed to join instance and went straight through the window and into the lava
---
It's simple.
---
I charge, I press Mortal Strike, I one-shot-crit. Then I move on.
---
Doesn't get any funner or rewarding than that. 
---
I believe shaman pve specs are the least explored in the game. 
---
Many think elemental is not good in pve which couldn't be further from the truth. You have to circumvent their weaknesses which means gearing different then other casters. Down ranking is bad. Which means elemental values intellect and Max Mana pool over spell power. A pre-raid fully buffed elemental shaman will have a 9.5k Mana pool which allows them to self sustain any fight in MC and on shorter fights they can chain lighting and shock on CD.
---
Enh. This is the least explored spec in the game and arguably the largest potential. We have to look at what the shamans strengths are. While I don't have concrete theorycrafting on it. Gearing as a caster and using your mainhand weapon as a felstriker or ironfoe. The value enh shaman needs is spellcrit because significantly more valuable then melee crit. 
---
I've glossed over alot trying to keep this post short. But there is a tremendous amount of info I have on both ele and enh that seems to be overlooked by a majority of players
---
&gt; dont have time to have fun  
---
Meta: The statement that defines life as we know it  
---
But isn't that more or less "targeted" at the person with the highest threat?
---
Lol clearly you haven’t pvp’d as both a 60 orc hunter and 60 dwarf hunter. Cause I have. 
---
Paladins are the best pvp healers, and give their team bof so you can’t kite. They aren’t a threat to kill you, but they are the best support class and make their teams way stronger than shamans. As a dwarf you get the benefit of the best buff in the game blessing of kings. 
---
Shamans are way easier to deal with. You can stun them; trap them, wing clip them. If a shaman jumps you just scatter/feign/trap to reset fight and get max distance. Shamans totems don’t help orc hunters at all. 
---
Zomg 1/3 stun resist! &lt; stoneform and paladins on your team. 
---
Is told of an error in his original text, doesn't edit it to remain authentic.  
---
Good guy Wize.  
---
God damnit
---
I will tack on a little bit to enh. I think it struggles until AQ where it can utilize it's strengths. BIS is your tier 2.5 then gearing like a caster dps with edgemasters and a 2h axe. The goal of the spec is to snapshot a magma totem with a zandalari hero charm. Magma totem is insane with a 34% spell coef. And being able to shock and chain lightning on CD is incredible dps increase. Not being able to reliably use magma totem in MC and bwl is what holds the spec back early game, but it has amazing potential late game to be a "viable" spec not optimal but certainly not the dog shit it is gearing full melee dps stats

I never said that. That was you, and it is completely different. The majority of people who play pvp can easily make the distinction.
---
Missing Frost Shock
---
Hi, /u/Sengira
---
No gatekeeping!
---
It is unlikely you won't get a raid spot as a Resto Shaman. Windfury Totem literally makes or breaks Horde compared to Alliance, Horde Fury Warriors doing more damage and the tank doing higher TPS is legit the only reason the factions are comparable at all in PvE, even though Alliance has a huge edge. In later raids with more area damage Chain Heal also contributes, actually allowing you to run with less healers than Alliance for some fights which means another DPS slot. Basically for every four Warriors/Rogues a raid has, they want a Shaman. You might have noticed people talking about wanting eight Warriors, well that is two Shaman right there! Realistically three is the *minimum* you'd want.
---
Boredom is subjective. I've met people who loved every class and hated every class from this perspective. Ask people WHY they found it boring or WHY they found it interesting, and compare to what you know about yourself whether YOU would like it or not. 
---
For pure optimization I'd say just don't DPS. There are better NF wielders (Hunters), better ranged damage classes, Shaman don't really bring anything worthwhile there. Just because of how long gearing a raid takes, bringing something obviously sub-optimal in my mind is pointless, I'd rather have an empty slot and not have to gear it. 
---
Are you impyling on a pvp server you can kill all 3, with 0 consequences, and tag the mobs yourself dancing through a meadow?
---
Yup
---
Ill be playing a beast mastery night elf hunter with Goblin Engineering, focusing mainly on pvp 
---
Warlock farming is great. It's quick as you can continue mob to mob without having to drink often, if at all. They're also great in open world PvP, UNLESS they get jumped after doing a substantial life tap. That'll effectively be a one-shot from most classes. However, you can counter this with simply keeping soulstone on yourself and always keeping a HS up. 
---
Raiding as a warlock is a ton of fun. You aren't that BA of a DPS until progression into AQ40 because of gear scaling and specifically, threat. You end up throttling back BIG TIME, most of the time. For instance, on Broodslayer in BWL, you won't end up DPSing until he passes 50%, and that's if your raid leader calls out for it. If not, you'll most likely end up being delegated to whelp duties.
---
Your rotation will consist of maintaining your curse, corruption for nightfall procs (if allowed per the debuff slot allotment), and shadow bolting. Aside from this, you'll be VERY important for summoning and ensuring that the tanks and valuable DPS have HSs. The big downside is having to farm shards for 30 minutes or so beforehand, but even then, it's not bad by any means.
---
Anybody who says "locks are worthless, rather take a mage," don't understand utility and effectiveness of bringing at least 3 locks for curses.
---
&gt;It also adds accurate spawn points to your map/mini map to show you exactly where something should be. Rather than the vague map markers that Questie adds.
---
So much sniping of unique named quest mobs with this feature.  Right on the money stealthed just spamming shred watching the party of 5 waiting for it in the location where it previously died like 10 yards away.

I disagree completely. I think the fact that the enemy is a real and threatening element of the world makes the game far more compelling, simply because you know you could be assailed at any time. It forces you to think about how you move around the world (avoiding enemy stronghold and staying vigilant for higher level opponents). There is skill in being able to inflict pain on the enemy, avoid enemy ganks yourself, and occasionally win a fight when caught at a disadvantage. Face it, PvP servers offer many facets of play that carebear servers don't and can't. I hate to stereotype but many of the players I've encountered that preferred PvE servers were weak players who refused to make friends and nursed a victim mentality. The exact type of player associated with retail now. 
---
There is a reason almost all popular private servers have been PvP servers - the ruleset appeals to gamers of the vanilla generation who weren't afraid to play a game where you are free to interact with others in both positive and negative ways with the training wheels off. That said, if your preference is PvE, if that is how you see yourself as a player, I'm glad you will have the option. 
---
I still have STVietnam flashbacks... my friends... the chain-stuns...
---
Eh, you are automatically imagining a complete failure scenario which is not the right attitude bro
---
People would trade WoW gold for Runescape gold/items. It's all the same shit, gold trading.

First 2-3 months: Retail 55% / Classic 45%

Half a year later: Retail 80% / Classic 20%
---
Yep um going shaman as well.  Chain heal is boss, and I love the nature effects. Plus I can go enh and have fun windfurrying
---
Hunters are taken as a token Tranq bot in raiding, and almost never more than 2. Their DPS is horrendous past BWL.
---
Hunters were absolute 10/10 god-mode in Sunwell-era TBC.
---
I do agree that Legion/BfA Hunter is absolute trash though. I miss TBC-&gt;MoP Hunter so, so much.
---
After the initial rush maybe 10-15%

Josh, you really outdid yourself this time ;)

Hi, /u/hypezlol99

Gonna really activate your almonds being able to see retail in the launcher
---
I still remember this quest very well, as it bugged on me. After Onyxia appeared, the quest just came to a complete halt. She would not become hostile, and the dialogue did not continue. You could target her, which would make her turn to you, but that was it.
---
It was quite funny, as I could do nothing to restart or continue the quest. Lots of people on the server were confused as to why she was just standing there in the keep. Had to contact a GM in order to reset that part of the server.
---
Players won’t know either way because sub numbers are no longer public
---
&gt; Wouldn't there be a very real need to test and ensure that everything was ported and functioning correctly after such a complex process?
---
Yes! Stuff like animations, sound effects etc should be beta tested. Arrows made the new BFA sounds in the demo for example. Arrows/Archery didnt make those sounds in vanilla. With it being audio I could see them forgetting to remove that. And the font for damage.... And the functions of the combat log are waaay different in WoD/Draenor too (although people may not care about that).
---
Hardiness provides 25% increased resistance to stun, there you go buddy.

Some ppl think it will pass retail. It is a lot more fun and rewarding feeling.
